                I don't usually watch the romantic comedy genre of things. I always enjoyed action, fantasy, adventure like Soul Eater, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun etc. but for some reason I was in the mood for something different. 
Toradora is just the 3rd romcom anime series i watched and I can truly say that it has become my FAVORITE anime.
The short version of this review is: I very much enjoyed Toradora
-The characters are all unique, likable, and relatable due to the fact they all display their weak sides sometimes and moments of insecurity behind the personality exterior. The chemistry between the characters was fun to watch
-The story stays
                  away from cliches and was relatively unpredictable for a love story. Every character had a reason and motive for what they did and how they acted, other than just being unnaturally dumb/too prideful/stubborn.
-The soundtrack was really good, making certain scenes all the more memorable
-I loved the comedic scenarios in the beginning of the series, which gets progressively more serious and emotional as we get deeper into the story and characters, but the overall vibe of the show stays relatively consistent to the end
-I became emotionally invested in the overall plot and characters and couldn't stop watching, which is extremely rare for me, especially for this genre
Overall:10/10
----
I watched the 1st episode and was interested. After the 2nd ep, I was hooked. I watched all 25 episodes in one go, back to back, because I couldn't stop. Never has another series been able to keep me going (I usually don't watch more than 5 episodes in one sitting), but Toradora kept me wanting to click on the next episode each time until I was finished, and left wanting more (even though I was satisfied with the ending)
Afterwards, I thought a lot about why an anime series of a genre that is usually not my taste could have been able to retain my attention for so long, and i realized the answers: the characters and the overall story.
The characters are what make this series so great. Each character have personalities that are unique and rather realistic and believable (or as realistic as animes go). There is no ""super"" character that acts too good or too cool for school. There is no ""that annoying"" character that acts too snobby or stuck up, which can sometimes be a problem for tsundere characters. And this is all because every character shows a weak side or moments of insecurity, which makes each of them more relatable. It also allows for many rather comedic scenes as well as emotional moments. But the best part is the interactions and chemistry between all the characters, and the way each of them change as their relationship with each other grows.
The second thing is the story. The reason I usually don't care for romance or drama is because I usually find the story too cliche or predictable. I also hate those cliche moments of ""coincidence"", for example, when a main character happens to see his/her love interest with someone else accidentally and misunderstands. I also hate it when characters act unnaturally stupid or too prideful for no reason and let it get in the way of the relationship. 
But none of those cliche moments happen in Toradora. Every character has a reason and motive for the actions they decide to take. The story managed to keep me guessing and wanting to know what will happen next, instead of making me feel like i could write the story myself.
Another plus for Toradora is the music. There are some key scenes where the soundtrack actually triggered goosebumps and made me tear; it still does even after rewatching. THAT IS RARE FOR ME. In fact i don't think anything I've ever watched, not just anime, can even make me feel that emotionally invested in fictional characters.
Almost forgot to mention that after it was done, I started to watch it again from the beginning the next day. Another rare occurrence for me, as usually i don't feel like rewatching things for months.  I was able to pick up certain things that i missed with the first watch thru. The only reason I put the story as 9/10 was because of this. A few plot points weren't really shown or conveyed in the best way and were missed even to an avid viewer like me. But I was glad to have felt that way, leaving me thinking about what I missed, instead of feeling like I could have easily figured it out or seen it coming. 
Again, Toradora has become my favorite anime, as a guy that usually doesn't care for this genre, which says a lot. It gave me more enjoyment than any of the other anime I have seen so far. I would recommend it to anyone, not just romance lovers.",10

                This's the first time I got the ""4 seasons"" feeling while watching an entire anime show.
What's ""4 seasons"" feeling I am talking about? Here's the explanation:
I felt the sensation changed 4 times while watch this anime:
1st time: During episodes 1 to 2, watching those episodes for the first time I thought this series would just be a light comedy anime which will make me chuckle without a  complicated story. It just like the spring season that give a high hopes on the early year.
2nd time: During episodes 3 to 14, I'm getting a bit bored and almost drop it, but I decided to push
                  my self to finish it (the only reasons I want to finish it is just because I got interest by the last main character who showed up in this part). It just like summer season that is really hot, and the only fun is going to beach during the summer break.
3rd time: During episodes 15 to 24, my curiosity was piqued for what will be going on with this show, things got a bit complicated, and I think this part is the ""life"" of the series. Just like an autumn season, although the flowers fall, but becomes a wonderful scenery.
4th time: During the final episode, ""WHAT THE HELL"", with this final episode, I mean everything seems fine at the beginning of the episode, but in the end it turned out anti-climatic for me. Just like the winter season, unpredictable storms, snow, and always cold; but after that Spring comes.
Well, that's my personal view of the story, so I give 7/10 for it.
Art and Sound, nothing particular to comment, it all seem good enough, and I like the second opening OST. 7/10 for both of it.
All characters were unique, both in design and personalities, even with the supporting characters, they are all really good. A great job was done by the creator at this point. EXCEPT for MC's pet, it's very annoying, and I really like ""Ami-n"", her appearance, her personality, her reactions, her way of pretending to be an adult (she's the last MC that I mentioned before), so 8/10 For Chara design.
For the enjoyment, I think I'll go for 7/10 that because this show had me feel bored once, and the ending was anti-climatic for me, but I do like the humor and story development (starting from episode 15).
Overall 7/10 score for this show.",7
"
                Romance has always been a tricky, unforgiving genre; you make one mistake and the story slowly begins to crumble. Why is that? Well, as many of us may know, love is a complicated business. So is entertainment. So why do we watch romantic series? There's many different answers that vary based on the individual. Maybe we're simply taking a chance at trying to find a feeling. A feeling of the tingle of our heartstrings, or a stir in our human emotions. It's good to feel these things from time to time. Fortunately for us, Toradora is a series that gracefully grants us this chance. It
                  captivates us in remembering what a romance series should strive to be.
What makes Toradora so exceptional as far as the romance genre goes? Is it the story? The art? The Sound? The Characters? It just may be all of them combined. I'd like to begin by stating something. The story of Toradora is very predictable. Cliché even. But wait, isn't that a bad thing? While the story may seem plain, the execution of the pacing is undeniably good at assuming a calm, relaxed flow for the majority of its run which, in turn, yields a satisfying romantic series as a result.
Toradora is not like many other romantic series out there that have characters fall in love simply just because. Love slowly stems from what begins as two people who become friends looking for mutual assistance in their romantic interests. Toradora gives its audience room to breathe and focuses the first half of the show on building the friendship between the two main characters through silly, lighthearted antics, making developed romantic feelings between characters seem more realistic and sincere later down the line when things become more serious. However, love is a complicated business, as I've said in my introduction. People's feelings do get walked over and left in the dust. While it's thematically a good thing for the audience to feel touched emotionally, seeing characters getting their emotions crushed was truly a somber sight to behold.
The art was smooth and was enjoyable visually. I did like the consistency that Toradora’s animation offered. For a series that was done in the 2008-2009 time period, it still looks marvelous and holds its own compared to more recent anime. The sound was a big plus in my book. While I liked both the OPs and EDs, I have to give a big shout out to the timing of the music during dramatic moments; that repetitive melody of piano left quite a strong impression on me. I'd like to also address that the script and voice actors were really quite something. The dark little subtleties in comments or remarks were an admirable feature the show had to offer.
I think every romantic series heavily depends on its cast to be the foundation of the series, holding the structure of the show into place. The characters of Toradora are an interesting bunch that create the opportunity for its audience to laugh and also feel gloomy. There is more than meets the eye underneath these seemingly cliché characters. Ryuuji is the male lead and he is generally a very likable, realistic character. He struggles with romance, gets low self-esteem because he’s self-conscious, and regularly voices his opinions on matters at hand. Throughout the show he proves that he’s a loyal friend and all around good guy, though he might be a little obsessive compulsive about cleanliness and order. But hey, who doesn't have their own little quirks?
Moving onto the main female lead, I felt a little wishy-washy in regards to liking Taiga’s character. I’m not a fan of the tsundere type, and that’s exactly what she is. While Taiga acts like a brat most of the time, she also becomes more and more endearing as the series progresses. She stands up for herself and her friends, and despite her childish behavior, generally cares for the people around her. With the main two characters out of the way, what about the other ‘main’ characters: Minori, Yuusaku, and Ami?
One of Toradora’s strengths was allowing the supporting characters to have their moments in the spotlight. Because of this, we are able to obtain a deeper understanding of them and paint a better picture of them as characters. While Ami and Minori seem perceptive of the relationships in the group, I’m honestly not sure about Yuusaku. Under his oblivious façade it’s somewhat difficult to tell. While he's Ryuuji's best friend, he is oddly quite different compared to him. Yuusaku is energetic, outgoing, responsible, yet also very silly and childish. Minori seems like genuinely a nice girl with the happy on the outside cliché personality, but Minori is really a coward underneath it all; she doesn’t confront her own emotions and constantly pushes for Taiga’s happiness at her own expense. It’s not that I disliked Minori as a character, it was just agitating to watch her at times. Last but not least, Kawashima, Ami. Ami is the most astute of the unsaid troubles that are bothering the people in the group and often makes subtle comments or sarcastic remarks pertaining to their unspoken feelings. When she is first introduced she seems extremely stuck up and vain, but as the series progressed it becomes more apparent that she’s tactfully looking out for the people she can finally call ‘friends’ for the first time. She developed the most out of the three supporting main characters, in my opinion, and easily became one of my favorite characters of the series, if not my most favorite.
Despite how gratifying I thought the series was, I also can’t turn a blind eye on the aspects of the show that I did not like. One of the most annoying tropes in anime, at least for me, is characters getting hit for no reason, or very petty ones. It's a trope that comes hand-in-hand with the tsundere character archetype, and it's one of the reasons I dislike tsundere characters as a whole. Taiga, who basically goes down the list of tsundere character traits like a check list, is a huge offender of verbally and physically abusing Ryuuji early on in the series. If you're like me, you'll find this to be quite vexing. Lastly, fan service is apparent in nearly every recent anime. While I personally dislike fan service, I know that many series utilize it to keep a portion of their audience interested. I watched Toradora because it was a romance story that set itself apart from most others. Although it's substantially toned down, comparatively to other series, I believe Toradora would have been better off not utilizing any fan service at all.
While I did like the ending overall because it ties things up nicely, and felt fairly rewarding, I did not like how the ending felt very rushed. The amount of material crammed into the last couple episodes felt considerably off, considering the rest of the show was focused on coaxing the relationships at a much slower pace. A couple bad apples on a tree don’t make the rest of the apples rotten, and Toradora was far from being bad. It isn’t a completely perfect series, but one of the best the romance genre has to offer in anime so far.
Every once in a while a person can't help but wonder what if. There has been a time in all our lives when we have pondered the thought of meeting the 'one' who is exactly right for us. Every day we strive to find a person, or people, who understand and accept us for who we are. Maybe, just maybe, you’ll find that one person that fits together with you like two consecutive cogs in an intricate machine. Maybe, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who is exactly right for you. It's not because this person is perfect, or because you are, but because your combined flaws fit together seamlessly in a way that allows two different beings to coexist together perfectly as equals … something like a Tiger and a Dragon.",9

-------------------
Toradora!= Another normal romance/drama anime involving high school...We had many anime of this kind. In fact, these type of anime are very common nowadays. I had watched this type many times, but mostly ended up so wrongly. 
But this time, Toradora! is done the right way. Yup, I ended up loving this ""normal"" anime. Story involves two high-schoolers, a normal guy, and a short girl....Now where have I heard that from? Many anime had this kind of story. Yup, It kinda gives me feelings of Deja Vu-ness. This time its done the way I like it. On to the review....
Story-
                  Involves a ordinary guy named Ryuuji Takasu and a short and short-tempered girl named Aisaka Taiga. This reminds of Saito and Louise from the Zero no Tsukaima series. Where the protagonist always gets beaten up by the girl, yeah those type. And more strangely, most of these short anime girls are always so strong or feared by many..thats Taiga a.k.a Palmtop Tiger. While Ryuuji only looks scary, but in reality, he's pretty harmless. OK~ enough of that...Why only a 7 for the story? Its pretty common..and its very predictable. I knew Ryuuji would end up with Taiga even just by looking at the cover art without watching the anime!. So obvious, so predictable, which makes it a bit boring. This flaw is common in many romance/drama anime, but its quite annoying. Story have a very good pace but it took quite a while for both of the hero and heroine to fall in love. Yup, they fell in love...but it took so long! But that's a good thing right? haahha- well~ those are the flaws I found here. Story= 7 out of 10.
Art- Graphics are rather unusual but very good..which I would say, Graphics are unique, that's for sure. Good graphics should receive a good score!
Art= 9 out of 10.
Sound-  The anime had 2 OP and 2 ED...1st OP was...strange. Same goes for the 1st ED. But the 2nd? Both the 2nd OP and ED are both awesome~. The 2nd OP tells  Ryuuji and Taiga's ""love"" arc is going to start. Don't get any wrong ideas. XD
Sound= 9 out of 10.
Character- All characters are uniquely made...Yup, especially Taiga and Minori. Minori had a very funny attitude which I loved. Awesome characters, awesome score.
Character= 10 out of 10.
Enjoyment- I enjoyed every single episode there was, some were very memorable but few are forgettable. I personally, enjoyed every minute of the anime which included comedy, parodies, romance, and some parts were very sad. Sad, but not as sad as Ef- Tale of memories. Toradora! can make you have ""watery eyes"", but Ef probably can make you cry. Beyond Awesome enjoyment.
Enjoyment= 10 out of 10.
Overall= Toradora! is not really recommended for everyone to watch, but Its highly recommended for fans of Romance/drama/comedy anime with a bit of sadness. If you bought it, its worth every penny. Anyone looking for some romance, then this could be your answer to that question. If you watch it online, its worth every minute and if you downloaded it, its worth every bits of data. 
OVERALL= 10 out of 10. Really loved it.",10
"
                Toradora! is one of the most annoying shows I have ever watched. And it has the single most ridiculous  ending of all anime I've seen. Even the ending of Claymore was more satisfying, which is saying something.
It is naturally that annoying because initially it seems to have much quality. I liked animation, music, opening, and, most importantly, I really liked most of the characters, including Taiga and Ryuuji. It is definitely quite cliché but charming brainless high-school romance with engaging characters isn't something I automatically hate. 
But, as episodes go by, all of the shows' cons start to become visible. First of all -
                  it is too long relative to its content. Generally I'm ready to forgive Japanese for being so inept at confessing emotions, but my tolerance is limited and after over ten episodes fueled only by ""omg, I'm so Japanese, I just can't spit it out"" I'm totally fed up. Then around episode 11th Toradora experiences massive tone-shift and evolves into a soap opera without any significant comedy element. It wouldn't be a problem, but honestly it's not a very good soap opera - the dilemmas and problems seem forced for the sake of drama and easily solvable, had characters sit down and talked. As a result the entire middle part of the show feels completely unnecessary and contributes little to the main plot.
But still it is not tragically bad and these unnecessary middle parts may be fun for someone who likes Slice of Life genre. The real problems begin when the series after much overblown melodrama finally establishes official couple. There are many people who didn't like the pairing and preferred the other ones. For me the problem was not the pairing (because I personally preferred it over the others) but the way it was dealt with - I got the strong impression that the story on an emotional level actually justifies these other relationships better (even although I didn't like them). The final confession ends up being forced onto the couple, not only by the writers who want to rush the end, but by the other characters in-universe as well. As a result final romantic couple is not very romantic - at least one side of that pairing was literally dragged into it by external circumstances. And when one puts into consideration the fact that this forced side had all the chance to act on its own will few episodes before, yet it chose to pass, one begins to wonder what the writers had on their minds.
Still, I wouldn't dislike the show that much. But the very last arc also turns Toradora!, already an over-exalted soap-opera, into a full-blown Bollywood movie. The only difference between the two is that Toradora manages to have even more unnecessary stupid drama than its Indian counterparts.  Characters start to behave completely at random, clearly with a goal to create as much drama as possible, without any other reason. The viewers are presented with a runaway couple (which ran away for no reason whatsoever), hasty engagement (without even sharing a single kiss beforehand), missing fathers, a few family reconciliations and the girl leaving a boy without a single a word for an extended period of time (again without a good reason). All of these serious events are introduced over the span of one and a half episode and resolved almost immediately. That was so unbelievably contrived, idiotic and poorly handled it was painful to watch. And it was absolutely not romantic. At all.
There is something seriously wrong with romantic comedy that manages to be ultimately neither romantic nor funny. That combined with the unbearable forced melodrama and the clumsy treatment of last six episodes sinked this show so much, I can't rate it any higher.",3
"
                Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.
Story: Secret love, unrequited love, love triangle... So yeah... The funny thing is that the ending is given away in the beginning. This can't even be considered spoilers to say that the main characters are going to end up together. Anybody who says otherwise is just too blind to realise this. Let's take the main points of the plot. First of all, one guy, one girl, each in love with each other's best friend. Two, those two try to support each other with their love interest. In order to do that, make them spend a lot of time together.
                  Even make them live next to each other. Give them a social outcast aura and the result is: congratulations! you got yourself a very unoriginal couple. Now this is a shame because the idea is quite realistic, only too obvious which gives you no expectations. For all I know, Ryuuji and Taiga could hold hands, cuddle, hug, kiss, have sex, get married and act like there is some distance between. Awkward since there is absolutely none. From the beginning, they were already ridiculously close to each other by living next door but no, not close enough, need to live under the same roof. Even best friends don't do that ( yeah I know, room-mates or particular situation involving money but that wasn't one of them ) so it clearly gives you an idea of their relationship.
Art: This part pisses me off, it is so bad. Taiga is supposed to be cute... it didn't do it for me.She looks like an underdeveloped child with a big head and permanent bed hair.  Maybe it's just me but the chara design really need some work. However Ryuuji's face gets +1. Now if I just say this without evidence to back up my argument, it's just trolling. If possible, watch the fight scene between Taiga and Sumire. To avoid spoilers, well, watch it on mute and no subs... The animation is really sloppy here, whether it's the lighting, the background characters with the same face or simply character motions. The art is good only when everything is still. Sloppy sloppy sloppy.
Sound: Too bad I didn't pay much attention, but the openings and endings were nothing spectacular or catchy. When it comes to sound, I would say that music is more important than the voice acting since most of the time, the acting is flawless, it just comes to whether or not the seiyuu's voice is appropriate to the character. In Toradora, it's the usual. The usual being flawless performance. Now for the music, the comparison might be unfair but Toradora is nothing compared to say, Clannad. I chose Clannad because no matter the scene, sad, happy or epic, it's easy to remember the themes while Toradora produces music that you hear in elevators or supermarkets. Only one stands out: Lost my Pieces. But it's just one... Not enough.
Character: Ami saves the show a little with Minori not far behind but Taiga... Damn she pisses me off! Ryuuji is not bad but too weak to be important.
Ami and Minori had good scenes, good chara development. I didn't give a shit about Kitamura because he is a creepy smiling guy. Ryuuji had some changes but nothing significant. Taiga on the other hand, just got more and more annoying. She's not even a tsundere, the dere part is inexistant and replaced by retard state, otherwise she's just a plain spoiled bitch who needs to be left alone. That does it, she gets a -2 for being so unlikeable. Past the physical appearance which I don't even like one bit, she has nothing left except her execrable personnality. Now one way to sum up this show is that the side characters are more interesting than the main characters. When I say main, I mean Ryuuji and Taiga. Kitamura, Minori and Ami are side characters to me. While watching the show, I realised that I had no interest in whatever happens to Ryuuji and Taiga cause they already act like a couple. The side characters however make you want to know more about them. Creepy smiling dude Kitamura has a good reason for being like this while double face Ami and oddball Minori are kinda left out towards the end after much chara development. Bad idea. My main concern is how people perceive Taiga. She does things that makes you want to slap her really f*cking hard and shout what the f*ck is wrong with you? yet she is still described as being cute, lovely etc... That girl seriously has anger issues and they can't be justified by people calling you palmtop tiger, that's retarded. She's so rude it's not even funny. Now this might be spoilers but it sums up pretty much why I think her personality is the worst. In one scene, she learns about her unrequited love confessing to a certain girl who for specific reasons refuses to give a proper answer. This is because she's going away soon so she can't say yes yet doesn't want to lie to herself by saying no. What should Taiga do in this case? Well, nothing. For the simple reason that it doesn't concern her. Still, she goes out of her way to beat the crap out of that girl while insulting her and forcing her to say she hates the guy. I was thinking ""WTF"" the whole time. What gives her the right to beat someone up just because that person is a coward when it comes to love? If we had to beat up every person who is a coward because of love, we're doomed. Besides she's also overreacting and goes as far as insulting and hitting people for no reason. With Ryuuji, they represent the epitome of shallow people. Both of them have a crush on someone who's really popular. The reason surely is because they treat them differently from the rest of the class. If that's not being shallow. Take one guy who's a social outcast. Now take a girl who's really popular, kind, funny, pretty and easy to talk to. This one guy would probably fall in love with that girl if she goes to talk to him because he's probably thinking ""she's so nice, she talks to me while the other bastards don't even look at me, maybe she cares about me"" without realising that maybe she's just nice and talks to everybody. This describes Ryuuji and Taiga perfectly.
Enjoyment: I was really disappointed by Toradora. At first I thought it would have nice development with the introduction of Ami but I guess not. It was dull and slow. Once you feel like there's something going to happen just push the reset button because it has the same feeling. Got some funny scenes though. Unfortunately the show is barely realistic. You don't root for development of the relationship between the characters and their crush because there's no feeling, no background story. Things would've been simpler like this:
Ryuuji: I like Minori.
Taiga: Oh... I see. I like Kitamura.
Ryuuji: !!! What!? Ok. So...
Both: Wanna hang out sometimes?",3
"
                Note: this series has been dropped at episode 14
Unlike the main protagonist of this anime, I do not have much strength to withstand torture. Put me in the clutches of a diabolical serial killer/torturer, and I have no idea what I’d do. Ryuji, our hero, is one of a kind. Bards should sing about him in taverns all across Tamriel. For 14 episodes, he stands Taiga’s relentless abuse with a smile.
In one of the greatest songs ever written, the extremely white lead singer of the Smiths sings about how it’s so easy to laugh and so easy to hate. Kindness and gentleness are difficult, and
                  I do agree with him. That said, I wonder if the band and their fanbase would change their mind if they saw the anime. Actually, considering how huge this anime is, becoming iconic in the school genre – I think they won’t.
I’m a defender of the school genre. Many rant about how immature and derivative it is, but few people didn’t go to school. A lot of things happen in school and you meet a lot of people, so it’s a place rife for stories. Its low-key and stable environment actually makes it excellent for stories driven by characters. Conflicts will have to rise from within and not an external UFO coming to wreck the party. These shows rely heavily on their characters, and it’s enough to have a decent, odd cast – see Haganai – to make something decent. Toradora is a major failure because of how insufferable its cast is.
Since we’re talking about symbols and not actual human beings, I need to find a way to explain why and how disgusted I was with them and how that lead me to conclude this anime is horrid crap. Many a great story are about horrible people. In fact, one of the best novels ever is about such a terrible murder. It’s their darkness, their psychology and reasons for being so that makes them so intriguing. How frightening these characters are because we understand them and see us in them. Part of our obsession with villains and their backstories, or with serial killers’ childhoods is because we want to know why they’re like this.
Everyone in Toradora is a bit of an asshole. Actually, only two characters are but they’re so dominant that it’s easy to forget about the rest. Taiga is the big problem, since she’s both the main character and the worst. Tsunderes can often seem creepy, sometimes borderline Gacy-like sadistic. None of them are as bad as Taiga.
The archetype can be funny. Tsunderes’ appeal is their insecurity, how they address the Presentation of Self in Everyday Life – we put up a front in every social interaction, putting a different front in different places. The best Tsundere, Neptunia‘s Noire is all about this. Humor never comes from her being violent – she’s rarely is – but how hard she works on her image.
In contrast, Taiga is nothing but violence. She reacts to everything with violence, like a 10-year-old playing Elder Scrolls and thinking that it’s supercool to kill every NPC. She may not kill anyone, let alone essential NPC’s but it doesn’t make it any less creepy. In every episode, she beats up people at least 5 times. Her reactions are always with force, causing clear pain to the other characters. I’d expect anyone to beat her in return the first time.
The fact Ryuji stays there is flat-out creepy. Moreover, she treats him with pure condescension. Rarely, if ever, she addresses him in a way that’s not hostile. Early in the series they make a pact to help each other, but Taiga doesn’t actually help him until the middle of the series. All the episodes are about the characters doing stuff and Taiga beating people up. The anime never answers why, exactly, Ryuji puts up with so much physical abuse.
Yes, ‘abuse’ is the only word that can describes their relationship. Switch the sexes. Imagine if Ryuji was constantly beating up Taiga, calling her ‘bitch’ and so forth. It’s nothing but sick. You can only watch it for so long before getting tired of this torture porn thing. Not only Taiga is violent to everyone, she also has a weird entitlement problem. She expects Ryuji to take care of her and do everything for her. She never asks, demands with the expectations that Ryuji must do it for her.
In the end, she’s nothing but a horrible person who beats up everyone but also thinks everyone owes her everything. Now, a character being a terrible human being isn’t enough. How their actions are framed is important and now we get to the main problem. Taiga is framed as okay.
A backstory occasionally rears its head, feelings of insecurity do show themselves. None of is it actually dark, none of it gives us a glimpse into a troubled psych that can only react with violence and cannot connect to people. The backstory may justify anger, but the anime never acknowledge how bad Taiga’s case is. No one around her also reacts like they should. They treat her like she’s a quirky friend, someone who occasionally goes off, like that friend who swears a lot. This is a person who’s in desperate need of help and a lawyer. It’s no longer a person having anger issues but a criminal that everyone tolerates because the plot demands it.
Such light framing of dark material is unforgivable. Humor doesn’t have anything to do with it, but how the frame never addresses the darkness of it. Physical abuse leaves people with trauma. People react harshly to physical abuse. If people stay for a long time with a physical person, being nice to them and doing what they want it means they got issues of their own. I can’t stress how dark this material is, yet the light framing is disrespectful to anyone who went through physical abuse.
Taiga and the framing of her behavior towers over the anime, so everything else ends up pointless. No matter how hard they try, the creators frame Taiga as quirky and cute. Nothing can salvage the anime, but then again it doesn’t seem they try. There isn’t much in the way of stories or characters. Ryuji is like that dude from Haganai only not as hot. Somehow he manages to be perfect and eventually the center of the harem because he’s nice to everyone and doesn’t have wants of his own. To the anime’s credit, the secondary male actually has a purpose here and he’s a bit hot, but besides being a more energetic nice guy there’s nothing to him.
Other females consist of a wacky redhead who’s entertaining for five episodes and then becomes tiresome. As for Ami, she’s another generic asshole who’s overall unpleasant without the darkness. Like Taiga, she treats people like crap but the cruelty is never meant to shock or make us reflect. Funniest thing is how the anime passes her off as sexy. Not only the characters can’t drive a story, but they look bad.
Art style is another problem the anime suffers from. No one has a distinctive look. School anime, at worst, create pleasing to look at characters. You may not experience anything profound but there is aesthetic value in the designs, in understanding human beauty. Designs don’t have to break boundaries, but little touches like Sena’s butterfly and deep eye color make an anime more pleasing to look at.
Toradora does nothing like this. Taiga does have a weird hairstyle, but Minori isn’t memorable at all. She has huge eyes and short red hair. End description. Worse offender is Ami who is meant to be the sex symbol. To express this, they gave her a longer hair and slightly bigger breasts. Unlike shows where the characters are actually sexy, her figure isn’t defined or emphasized – which is necessary if the character’s beauty is important to her personality. Her hair is just long without hairstyle quirks. Look at any anime that has a character whose beauty is important and you can always spot details expressing it – just as I described Sena in the above paragraph. The designers decided to do the bare minimum.
Character designs are integral to how we view them. How people look is a part of them. It doesn’t mean characters should all be sexy (that’s actually quite odd) but their looks should somehow find their way to their personality. If your character is meant to be beautiful, make them beautiful. Toradora is satisfied with just sending the signals, mistaking low effort for minimalism. Minimalism is when you have few details but these details are important. Ami’s design and everyone else’s has no effort put into it. A simplicity that has no elegance, that emphasizes no details is just a product of no effort and laziness.
Maybe the anime drastically improves. I have a hard time believing it. Watching this anime became painful. Witnessing the abuse Taiga inflicts on everyone, and expecting to be entertained and amused by it is too much. Torture porn at least acknowledges its characters suffer even if it expects me to find entertainment in pain. This anime pretends physical abuse doesn’t cause any pain. Truly, it’s objectionable almost on a moral standard.

                I'll keep this short and simple. Screw this anime.
Sound and art are fine. Not really too detailed art with a little bit of comedy sketches. The sound matches well with the series which would give it a higher score if the series was good.
Now the reason why this series sucks. TAIGA IS A GIANT BITCH. That should be tazered and thrown into Mount Doom. I get the appeal of Tsundere which is the demographic for this show. Taiga is the completely horrible side of Tsundere. Tsundere are supposed to be a tale of two sides with a harsh side balancing a hidden sweet side. IF
                  the harsh side is a psychopath I don't give a damn if there is a sweet side. I don't even need to go past the first episode to prove that this girl is certifiable. She breaks into the protagonist's home, illegal, assaults him with a deadly weapon, illegal, damages his property, illegal, and then extorts him to get her to leave, illegal.
People in the anime world, abuse isn't fine if it's female on male. It's one thing if it's a single hit or insult every once in awhile but Taiga does this abuse constantly. It makes her completely unlikable for anyone who has dealt with abuse before and can't just laugh off a shit character. The easiest way to see if it hits the double standard is flip the genders. This becomes a freaking black comedy/horror if you switch the protagonist's genders.
I get the reason why people laugh at pain. Watching a drunk guy on youtube fall over himself and try to base jump off his roof is pretty damn funny. What I don't get is why anyone would willingly hang out with a person that makes your life hell by insulting and hurting you all the time. 
Any story that would try and portray a character like that as lead heroine role needs to be burned with fire. I would give this anime a zero but watching Taiga get her karmic justice raises the score. 2 out of 10 Recommendation: Put it on a rocket ship, fly it out to unknown coordinates, and hyper beam it into oblivion. The perfect example of how NOT to make a Tsundere lead in a romantic comedy (Her and Louise Valliere of Familiar of Zero).",2
"
                Going into Toradora, I wasn’t really expecting too much from it. I thought it would be your standard school life love story we have all seen so many times before. But low and behold it came out to be surprisingly good, and has quickly become one of my favorite 2008 airing anime series.
Story: 9/10
The story revolves around Ryuuji and Tiaga, two ordinary students that end up working together in order to help one another end up with the ones they love. It stays pretty true to the ""love story"" formula. What makes this anime really good is the excellent pacing it takes with the story.
                  In many ""school life"" anime we always end up watching filler style episodes, only to have the end of the series be the only thing good about it. Not so for Toradora however! It manages to keep the anticipation between the potential couples high, all along weaving together a pretty good in depth story that really shows the heart of the characters. A lot of times we have scenes that show the characters trying to get the words out to express their feelings, and others offer more side story scenarios-- which usually end up going in conjunction with a certain character’s inner turmoil and struggle. Each episode flows nicely into the next, and you get some pretty clever comedy along the way. Now that is not to say that Toradora's story is without fault; not every episode is particularity interesting as others, towards the end the story tends to drag on a bit and feel somewhat rushed, and the characters start to get in a sort of ""pity party"" mood with their situations, which can get to be a bit of a downer at times. Still though, haven’t all of us been there at one point in our lives, where we really want to say what is in our hearts, but end up holding back for risk of getting hurt? Or even worse, hurting another? Overall the story is filled with enough drama and guess work to keep the audience into it! Though it should be said that hardcore romance fans may be able to predict some of the twists and turns the plot takes. It does come close to becoming a bit of a harem anime, but just never quite reaches that category. The anticipation of ""who will end up with who?"" --is the stories strongest feature, and the ending doesn't disappoint!!
Art: 7/10
The art really isn’t anything too special. You get a nice mixture of bright colorful characters and environments. The characters are sharp and well animated with their facial expressions, but the backgrounds can look a bit washed out at times. And some of the action scenarios can be a bit on the stiff side. Again, the character’s faces are what stood out for me the most with the art, you really feel like you can read them at times.
Sound: 8/10
Like the visuals, I wouldn’t go on par to say that the music can be anything more than ""appropriate."" You do get some pretty nifty opening and closing songs, and they change mid way through the series. The BG music was nothing--if not forgettable. Even while writing this I can’t really think of a piece that stood out for me. What does make the soundtrack so good however, are the character voices! All of them were matched perfectly to a ""T, "" and I could not find a single voice actor to be out of place with their role. I especially enjoyed Taiga’s voice. She has this tough girl tone and attitude, yet you can tell that deep down inside she really does care about those around her. Something that the viewer will indeed discover while making their way through the anime.
Characters: 9/10
Definitely the heart of Toradora! While going through this anime I really felt that I started a ""virtual"" style bond with them. I actually cared about the problems they had, and wanted them to end up happy in the end. Towards the beginning, viewers may find a character or two that they either dislike or even despise. But trust me when I say this: ""stick with it!"" They end up evolving and have many twits to their persona! Taiga is really the one who stole the show for me, she has so many layers to her personality that it can be hard to figure out just what is going through her head at times. A character named Minorin can be drop dead funny when she wants to be, and Ryuuji is a great guy that is always there for his friends. The best compliment I can say about the cast? They act very human (ie: realistic), maybe a bit exaggerated at times, but mix the two together very well! Which can be hard to do in an anime. My only real knock against the characters was, since there are multiple romance skits going on, at times it felt like some of them were a bit too discreet with confessing to one another; which in turn can make the story slow paced at times. I almost felt like I wanted to jump inside my computer screen and yell: ""Oh just say it already!!!"" That aside, there really isn't much to complain about, great cast! 
Enjoyment: 10/10
Despite some of the glitches in the storyline, I still never the less found myself totally drawn into the world of Toradora! It had more than enough to offer to keep me wanting more! The mixture of comedy, romance, suspense and tender moments--really drew me in!
Overall: 9/10
Toradora makes us contemplate what is more important in life; love or friendship? This anime really turned out to be a great surprise for me. Sure its got some flaws and all. But this series has it where it really counts; character chemistry and development! If you are a fan of romance anime, complimented with a great cast of characters and funny anecdotes. Then I highly recommend giving Toradora a try! It may not do anything new with its romance formula, but it does indeed do it right!",9
"
                Toradora can do one thing extremely well: comedy. The characters of Toradora are completely built for playing off each other well in comedic gags. That's why I really loved the first half of Toradora. It had some of the best school comedy scenes I've seen. 
However, at the half way point, after the Culture Festival, it seems that an invisible switch was flipped for the story, where instead of focusing on comedy, the drama would be more prevalent.
Now, there have been many shows that have been able to mix comedy and drama, they even form the genre of ""dramedy"", Kodocha and Clannad to only name
                  two. So I know that the two can be sucessfully spliced. In Toradora's case though, the result is jarring, as the humor seemingly disappears from the show to make room for chick fights, eavesdropping, confessions, and rejections.
The main problem in this transition form comedy to drama is the complete 180 degree turn some of these characters do. Since they were built for comedy, the author/director needed to change them for the drama.
Minorin is a wonderful example. She's super hyperactive and boisterous during the first half of the series. However, by the second half, when the show makes its transformation from comedy to drama, Minorin is just a shell of her character from just a few episodes prior. She broods, mopes, and loses pretty much all of her energy.
How am I supposed to take this story seriously when it seems like there are two different versions of the characters? I just cannot.
Now for the boring statistical review.
Story: 6/10 - The first half was great because, while it included several school cliches, it found a way to be different from all its predecessors. The second half, however, was just cliche, and often convoluted, where it seemed the author just made characters fight with each other for no reason.
Art: 8/10 - The artwork is above average, which seems to be what J.C. Staff strives for. It's not near the level of JC's other series of the Fall, Toaru Majutsu no Index, but it definitely suffices and detail is provided when necessary. 
Sound: 7/10 - I'm a fan of the first opening/ending, but the second set are adequate as well. The BGM is unobtrusive and largely unnoticeable, but that's not really a bad thing.
Character: 7/10 - As I said, these characters are built for comedy. Be it Ryuuji's near-OCD behavior when he happens upon a messy area or Taiga's childish demeanor whenever she sees Kitamura. They're funny. It's too bad that the characters were nearly all completely changed for the second half.
Enjoyment: 6/10 -  I loved the comedy in the first half, but dreaded the poor writing and inconsistency of the characters that plagued the second half. 
Overall: 7/10 - Overall, it's not bad. It's an average romantic comedy in a sea of romantic comedies.",7
"
                Toradora isn't your story that only focuses on one thing.  Well, at least I don't think so.  It conveys so much meaning to everything that is going on in life.  It shows you that sometimes, even your most important wish, the with you want to come true the most, can sometimes not be reached.  But it also shows some examples of how people decide their path and move on forward. 
Please bear with me.  This is only my third time reviewing.
The story was fantastic.  Even though there are only 24 episodes, which is actually plenty, the story was well
                  developed.  There are no complaints that I can think of right now.  For example, the person you thought you loved just because of the way they act wasn't the one you loved, then comes another person who is a match for you.  That is a good plot on it's own.  That connects to what is going on in the real world.  
The art...  Fantastic.  You could really tell they put a lot of effort into it.  From they're facial expression, even the walking, they put a lot of effort.  Then when the animation shifts to the parts where there is violence, the animation in that part was...  Wow.  That is all I could say.
The sound was great.  Everything, the sound effects were timed well, and the sound tracks matched perfectly with the scenes.  Although for some reason, the first ending song didn't quite get along with me.    But the rest was great.
The characters were really the perfect match with the story.  They're slow development in each episodes connects the viewer in the story that sometimes they might think that they are them.  
The enjoyment...  I enjoyed it very much.  It's not like romance is my highest favorite genre, but I still like it.  Especially in this one.  Also the comedy, some actions, and others were also factors of the enjoyment it brought.
Overall, this show was really great.  I only wish something like this will come in the future.",9
"
                NOTE: This Review will be Updated every 6 episodes
Toradora is a highly entertaining romantic comedy that successfully escapes the cliched harem tales that dominate the genre. Although it is somewhat let down by mediocre animation and music, the original premise and unforgettable dialogue make Toradora one of the best light hearted romances  of the season.
Story: 8
Toradora is based primarily on the interplay of Takasu and Taiga. A nice guy who has a fearsome reputation due to his aggressive looks, who makes an unlikely pact with a volatile, but cute girl, to help each other succeed with their respective crushes. This premise quite refreshing, and
                  unlike almost all anime within the genre, the male lead is not automatically the object of affection for half a dozen girls.
Unfortunately, the pace of the story is somewhat erratic. There are frequent episodes that seem more `slice of life', with no significant plot development. This, however, is not as bad is it seems, given that the events that do happy in each chapter are often hilarious, and well watching on their own.
Art: 7
Toradora art is not bad... not particularly good. It just does not stand out. While Taiga has a very attractive character design, some supporting characters do look rather bland. The background themselves are also serviceable, but not particularly noteworthy. There's nothing particularly wrong with Toradora's looks, its certainly comparable to that of for example, True Tears or School days. It just doesn't feature that extra level of excellence featured in Clannad or Tale of Memories.
Sound: 8
The voice acting for the characters are well done, and definitely fit their roles. However, the OP and ending themes are rather mediocre. 
Characters: 10
Toradora's main strength is the personality of its cast. Rarely is there a character as unique as Aisaka and Takasu. Their personalities are not only memorable, but also multi-dimensional. While Aisaka, for example, comes across as an arrogant and demanding girl, there are rare moments where her more timid side is briefly shown.
Enjoyament: 10
Toradora is a great anime to watch, and perfect for lifting you from a foul mood. It's both funny and touching, which makes it great for short study or work breaks.
Overall: 9
Despite its technical flaws, Toradora is an excellent example of what a light hearted romantic comedy should be like. Despite its rather exaggerated circumstances, it features an original storyline where the cast are more than just cliches.",9
"
                The premise of the show is pretty hard to believe. After an accidental meeting involving two violent outbursts, Taiga Aisaka and Ryuuji Takasu make an agreement to help one another pursue their respective love interests, Kitamura and Kushieda, who also happen to be Ryuuji and Taiga's mutual friends. It's the stockholm syndrome trope, create a situation in which the two main characters are forced to spend large amounts of time together and wait for them to fall in love. High school ‘contracts’ are an object of fiction, much like the accidentally overheard conversations that drive most of the character development. People do overhear things occasionally,
                  but when the relationship is progressed entirely through cliches, it’s pretty hard to take it seriously.
However, after a rocky beginning I actually began to enjoy watching Taiga and Ryuuji. Ryuuji is more functional than most adults, doing all the cooking and cleaning for his mom who comes home late from her job as a cocktail waitress and sleeps most of the day. Ryuuji finds another dependent in Taiga, whom he feeds and launders for on a daily basis. He discovers her living amongst dirty dishes and garbage after entering her unlocked apartment to wake her up and make her breakfast. What’s important here is Ryuuji isn’t just a caretaker to Taiga, he represents something she’s never had, a person who genuinely cares about her and accepts her for who she is. He's a surrogate parent, which will be incredibly significant as we learn more of her backstory. He doesn’t complain that Taiga’s a mess, he just helps her pick it up and she slowly improves. This relationship does have some kind of benefit for Ryuuji as well, though it's far from ideal for him.
He seems to derive enjoyment from taking care of the dysfunctional Taiga, and given his relationship with his mother, who's equally bad at taking care of herself, it's very understandable that he's okay with it, he's used to it after all. But not only is their relationship is entirely one-sided, Ryuuji deals with being verbally and physically abused by Taiga constantly, aggression can definitely be attractive in a girl, but there's a difference between being aggressive and abusive. As part of their agreement, Taiga calls him a dog and commands him to do whatever she wishes... and he agrees. I guess he just really, REALLY wants Kushieda, and somehow plotting schemes with the diminutive and violent Taiga seems a better idea to him than simply talking to somebody he's already friends with. It's not like Kushieda's distant with him either, she bubbly, confident, and provides Ryuuji multiple opportunities to get closer to her, hell, they get locked in a storage room together for hours. At this point the overbearing use of cliches started to make me believe Toradora! was a satire, but given the amount of melodrama I'm pretty sure that it's takes its romance seriously. However, it’s important to remember that it’s Kushieda he’s interested in, so it’s not like the show is trying to force TaigaxRyuuji down your throat, they’re simply spending time together, so Ryuuji maintaining Kushieda as a love interest helps the story feel somewhat believable, despite Taiga’s abuse.
As the plot continues to carve its destructive path, Ami is introduced, and with her, more opportunities for ""contract"" agreements that force characters to be in the same place together despite their apparent misgivings. I'm not sure if Ryuuji is aware that he isn't legally bound by the results of immature high school contests. In any case, the writers continue to create contrived situations that force character interactions that would not otherwise happen.
I liked both Ryuuji and Taiga, despite the unbelievable circumstances that make up their character development. I stated before Ryuuji enjoys cooking and cleaning and is very good at both of them, this detail is the precipitating factor for most of their interactions. Taiga is pretty helpless when it comes to household tasks and Ryuuji provides those services to her. Despite the horribly unrealistic circumstances I felt that Taiga and Ryuuji actually acted in reasonable ways for the most part. Taiga beats Ryuuji frequently but it's clear that she actually does like spending time with him. They're both laughably bad at pursuing their romantic interest but that's pretty typical of high schoolers so it's hardly surprising.
Kushieda is obnoxiously positive. She shares many traits with Ryuuji including domestic competence and is very hard working. I'm sure you've all encountered that person in high school who magically balanced multiple jobs, sports, and school, all while staying unusually cheery. Most of the time she was on screen I just found her really annoying, she's just WAY too positive, there is such a thing. I don't think she was necessarily a bad character, just not the type of character I liked and I wasn't remotely invested in her. I didn't care if Ryuuji made in success in pursuing her because 1. Taiga the obvious romantic interest so you know that nothing's going to happen anyway, and 2. because Ryuuji was such an idiot when it came to trying to win her over that I wanted him to fail. She also becomes the source of more forced drama later on, making it even harder to take seriously and threatening to ruin ending.
Kitamura is the man. At first you get the impression that he's the stereotypical ""obvlivious anime male highschool student"" but he has his own agenda, and it plays out in spectacular fashion. You have not seen a love confession until you’ve seen Kitamura. To be fair, his arc’s only purpose is to help make TaigaxRyuuji a thing, it also results in a fantastic sword fight, but he’s still pretty funny to watch.
Kawashima is introduced later and is absolutely fantastic. She’s far more mature than the rest of the cast due to growing up as a model in the “adult” world, but is stunted in some ways by her air of superiority. Her development was the best part of the show and creates some of the only believable drama between characters. Her conversations with Ryuuji are similarly realistic, they are rarely on the same page but it’s clear to the audience what she’s trying to tell him, which makes their interactions much easier to understand, why Kawashima finds Ryuuji interesting etc.
The biggest mark against the show is that it’s totally drowned in melodrama. Taiga overreacts in ways the get old fast, and the forced pathos ruins the genuinely emotional moments in the show. I need to emphasize this, there were truly some great emotional moments. The Christmas episode with the bear costume (you’ll know it when you see it) [i]almost[/i] caused me to shed a tear, a feat that only Grave of the Fireflies is capable of, but because of the melodrama surrounding most of the show, these scenes lose their effect. Of course, there’s also the incredibly contrived situations (See accidentally overheard conversations/confessions) that bring these scenes about, which doesn’t help.
The production quality was fairly good, I liked the character designs and the animation quality was impressive at times and never bad. Nothing else about its artwork or animation stood out but that’s not terrible in a romcom. The OST was kind of forgettable but does add a lot to the emotion in certain scenes and I wasn’t a fan of the OP/EDs.
Toradora! certainly isn’t bad. Despite its issues it delivers an heartfelt romance with well-defined characters, but the frustration with its asinine story telling was enough to outweigh most of the positive aspects. If you like melodrama, you’ll probably like Toradora!.
One final note, the ending is talked about incessantly, and it is very good. Many complain that it was rushed and didn't explain things well enough, but if you pay attention to the character’s values and motivations, you shouldn’t need the writers to spoon feed you Taiga’s reasons for why she did what she did. Just make sure you watch the last episode all the way through, past the credits and everything.",5
"
                Fairly enjoyable but not really cutting edge.
Overall - 6/10
I personally found Toradora to be somewhat enjoyable to watch but not exactly outstanding.  My biggest gripe was the use of Kugimiya Rie, coupled with J.C.Staff being the producer, which really dampened the potential impact this series.
For people not very informed, Kugimiya Rie has played the role of a tsundere with fairly similar personalities in 4 different anime works (Shana, Zero no Tsukaima, Hayate no Gotoku, Zettai Karen Children).  I liked the use of a deeper, lower tone for Taiga and I acknowledge this, but I simply found the (over) use of Rie rather stifling.
Story
                  - 6/10
A fairly normal high school setting which sets the stage for the intriguing characters to work on.  The story is really character-driven and while the characters do a great job, the background course of events are less than stellar, like as if a B-rate movie writer did it.  The events of the Cultural Festival, and the Ski Trip were really touching, and that made me almost raise the rating to 7.  However, the pacing seems to drag on over the winter period but feels rather rushed towards the end with bits and pieces missing.  I just didn't feel really satisfied with this.
Character - 8/10
I really enjoyed the cast and the way they transformed over the course of the series.  We get given characters with rather eccentric personalities which work nicely with everyone else.  There is good coverage of the thoughts, feelings and the transformation that occurs in the main leads and that is really pleasing to see.  I would personally liked to have seen more airtime for Ami's personality growth as she's probably the deepest person in the entire cast, and the ""answer"" to her was really rushed.  Overall a really great, and enjoyable cast.
The Seiyuu for Ryuuj/Nojima Hirofumi put in a solid performance but my pick of the lot is Minorin/Horie Yui who really brought up Minorin's eccentricity and hyperactivity in an excellent fashion.  My gripe with Taiga has already been mentioned.
Sound - 7/10
Nothing fancy in the BGM but I really loved the OP themes.  The two OPs really conveyed the mood of the story as it changed from one to another.  The timing in which OP2 was introduced was perfect.
Enjoyment - 6/10
My enjoyment in Toradora was closely linked with the story.  Unfortunately, despite the characters which gave me great joy worthy of an 8, the story felt really dragged out, so at the end of it all I feel it's a mildly enjoying show overall, but not one where my mind would get totally transfixed to.
Art and Animation - 6/10
Fairly good and consistent.  It's no KyoAni but does the job.",6
"
                It seems JC Staff loves to makes animes out of light novel publications from ASCII Media Works. Toradora! is one of their newest adaptations, and in the genre of romance/comedy that has been overdone extensively already, I am pleased to say that this anime has exceeded my expectations greatly.
Story: There is nothing extraodinary about the story in Toradora, I dare say its a cliched scenario of the 2 main characters being together for all the series to find out in the end they love each other. However the way Toradora excecutes and delivers this story was done so well that even if the outcomes and
                  events looked predictable, it would still keep you on your toes and make you want more.
Animation: This anime's strong point was not on the visual department, however it was still well animated and throughout the show we would be treated to a very rich and colorful anime that was pleasing to the eyes.
Music: Toradora proves that you dont need an awesome soundtrack to make an anime sound fantastic. Apart from a couple of tunes from the OST, there is really no standout songs in the show. However the songs are used so well in the anime they are able to really enhance the enjoyment of important scenes, making the show much more enjoyable. Also very solid voice acting, as expected from a top class voice actress as Kugimiya Rie but I was also highly impressed with Majima Junji's role as Ryuuji. Perfectly excecuted.
Characters: This is by far the show's best aspect. Not every anime is able to deliver such likeable characters and make them blend together so well. Throughout the series I was in constant debate on which of the main heroines I liked most, because the anime manages to develop every character so well. Even the supporting characters are very likeable, and are well developed in this show. And to my surprise, for this genre of anime the show managed to deliver a main male lead that I did not find a complete idiot.
Enjoyment: Man this show has been a blast to watch, every week I would go thinking they couldnt top last week's episode yet they still managed to do it almost every time. This is definitely one of my new favourites animes.
Overall: In the romance/comedy category, it is very easy for an anime to fall into the ""overdone"" category, despite all that, Toradora is able to keep a refreshing and interesting pace for most of its run and for that I salute JC Staff for this brilliant adaptation to a great novel. This anime proves that even if you dont have a groundbreaking plot, if you are able to provide an excellent execution with what you have you can still produce a top quality anime. If you are looking for a great romcom that is able to set itself apart from others and is able to maintain a great level of entertainment and quality, then I am sure Toradora will not disappoint you and I highly recommend it to anyone.",9
"
                Here is the story. The hot tempered girl is in love with the class rep. And the scary guy is head over heals for his odd, softball playing classmate. Both Taiga and Ryuj are unable to convey their feelings to the person they have feeling for. Therefore, they team up and try to fix their problems together. As if that isn't enough, a secretive demon like actress is thrown into the mix. Many hilarious and troubling events take place so that you end up falling in love with Toradora before it ends. It's cute, a good laugh, and well animated. In every category it's a
                  very enjoyable watch! I'd recommend it to everyone that likes a high school story about love and life.
So why the low score? Let's just say, I despised the ending. In order to keep from revealing anything, I won't say why. I loved the show up till the end of episode 19. Certain events took place that made me hate the show with a burning passion. That doesn't stop me from suggesting it to everyone else though. Most people liked it, and I bet you will too!",5
"
                Toradora is criminally overrated. It's very rare that I find an anime that lacks anything decent but Toradora is most certainly one. I truly loathe this anime and the support it gets. 
I usually don't look at reviews and ratings of anime before I watch them so that I am able to have an unbiased and unspoilt opinion when watching the anime. So, after enduring the agony of the anime I went on a few forums and saw a few reviews. After watching the anime and thinking that it was a steaming pile of garbage it was to my dismay that I saw endless romcom
                  thirsty viewers saying it was ""Their favorite anime"" and that it's ""the most underrated anime ever"". I despise myself for wasting even a second of my time enduring this anime and write this review in the hope that even one person saves themselves from the torture that is Toradora. 
To begin with, the characters are unbelievably hate-able and predictable. I absolutely detest Taiga and everything she stands for, words cannot describe how much hate i feel for this woman and her actions. Ryuuji is the most boring typical anime protagonist that serves no benefit to anyone's existence other than Taiga and his mother with whom he has an oddly borderline incestuous relationship with but not enough for it to be an interesting hentai. Minori is another typical loud and annoying airhead anime girl although she provides some moments of joy within the depressing rage that is Taiga. Yuusaku has some sort of pathetic breakdown in the middle of the series and remains an unpleasant and unnecessary character throughout the series. Ami is simply a conceited swine that is incredibly forgettable and abhorrent. 
The ending of the anime is one of the most pathetic endings I've seen in anime. It's as if the series defecated all over you and then just left. It removes what little purpose the entire series had by separating the two main characters and somehow passing that as some sort of tragedy. The show seems to label itself as a comedy, there was not a single instant within the show where I so much as smiled. The support that it gets from the community makes me lose faith in humanity and dislike the show even more.
I beg of you, if you have any sense of self respect, do not watch Toradora. I am not an unpleasant person in the slightest but Toadora brings out theworst in me. There are endless amounts of anime under the same genre that you could watch which are infinitely better.",2
"
                When you think of a romance, comedy, school life/slice of life, you think about an anime with two (or more) lovers as they go through thick and thin together. That certainly does not fit the description of Toradora!. In fact, I don't think anything is able to describe just how funny, touching, deep, and serious Toradora! is. 
I started watching Toradora! after reading the first few chapters of the manga. At first, I thought it was one of those series focusing purely on romance and comedy. I thought it was a carefree series that will bring watchers some laughs with some moments of romance. The
                  first few episodes did seem to be leaning toward this direction. However, as the story develops, I was blown away. The story and characters were so complex, fascinating, and unique that the description of a ""carefree comedy romance anime"" just can't fit Toradora!. Not at all.
The story, at its introduction, is simple. Takasu Ryuuji and Aisaka Taiga both have crushes on the other's friend. They decide to help each other. Really simple, and predictable right? Nope. As the story propels forward, so many wild and heartwarming events occur make the relationships between the friends not so clear. The story moves along a very smooth pace as well. Like other comedy/romance anime, Toradora! develops the story w/ episodic events. Unlike the others however, it blends the main plot and each event very well, so that you'll never see just an event (such as a house party or summer trip) that's just there for enjoyment. In Toradora!, the events drive the story, not the other way around.
What makes the story so much exciting, unpredictable, and anticipated are the wonderful characters of Toradora!. At the onset, the characters are introduced, and each have an obvious trait/personality that you have no problem identifying. Takasu is mean-looking and scares people, but he really is the ideal guy: nice, reliable, friendly. Kushieda Minori is the cheerful girl and Aisaka's best friend who is always energized and lighting up the mood. However, there is so much more than just that. As the story progresses, the characters do as well. Each character faces trials and obstacles in the story. As a result, they develop, change, and gradually become different. In addition, each character has inner feelings and pasts that influence their way of dealing with things. 
As you watch each episode, the main cast is so well created that you'll forget they're just figures of fiction. You will treat them as real beings, sympathizing with one and perhaps disapproving another. Your own feelings will change as the characters change. All of this leads to a wonderful experience that is Toradora!.
The art is well drawn. Backgrounds are clear, colorful, and sharp. Character movement is smooth. The sound is rendered and timed perfectly. Each background song/sound fits with the scene, and adds strength to it. The opening and ending songs are also very well chosen, perfectly fitting with the general theme of Toradora!.
I have greatly enjoyed Toradora!. I had average expectations and saw some potential in Toradora! when I started watching it in Oct. 08, when the Fall 2008 season came out. Unlike so many other anime that start with great beginning but only to degenerate, Toradora! shot through the roof of mediocrity with its great characters and story. It satisfied many viewers and went on to become even better as each week passed. Now that I've seen all 25 episodes, I must say, it was an incredible series.",10

                Romantic Comedies are some of the most common stories in modern entertainment, there never seems to be a shortage of them. Naturally, the genre can often be stale, relying on the same old tired formula over and over again. Some try to change things up with peculiar or supernatural circumstances, but more often than not just come off gimmicky. But every once in a while a really good romantic comedy comes out that reminds people of the value of the genre. Toradora is definitely one of these.
The story follows two high school misfits, Ryuji Takasu and Taiga Aisaka, and their developing friendship. Ryuji is misunderstood
                  by his schoolmates because of his intimidating appearance; in reality he is actually responsible nice guy (albeit certainly not a social butterfly). Taiga, on the other hand, despite her petite appearance is a real trouble child. She has a fierce and anti-social demeanor, and does not hesitate to put a beating to anyone who crosses her. These two are brought together because each has a crush on the other's best friend. They make an agreement to help one another win the hearts of their respective crushes. However, this is a lot harder done than said, as neither really has a clue about relationships. At the same time, they begin to find comfort in their makeshift friendship.
Admittedly, there is not anything particularly special about this set-up, and the story is actually quite predictable. You would have to be blind not to see how it ends from the moment Taiga and Ryuji meet. The funny thing is, though, none of that really matters. The real joy of Toradora lies in its presentation. Where other romantic comedies might rely on a quick gimmick to distinguish themselves from their kin, Toradora does not. What it does rely on, refreshingly enough, is quality writing and strong characterization.
Toradora has a nice balance of comedy and drama. The show can have you laughing one moment, then knock you down with hard hitting emotion the next. Silly misunderstandings, romantic rivalries, and other traits of the genre are utilized to develop characters in unexpected ways. Take for example the swimming contest between Taiga and her then rival Ami. It provided plenty of comedic moments that were amusing on their own, but also created a situation that further deepens Taiga and Ryuji's relationship as well. The way Toradora squeezes in character development at every opportunity is the key to its success. It turns what would otherwise be standard romantic comedy and school-life fair into something special.
The characters themselves, at first appearance, look like little more than a collection of tropes. Taiga is clearly a tsundere from the moment she appears, and there is not much that separates Ryuji from other protagonists. Taiga's best friend (Ryuji's crush) Minori is a hyperactive athlete; Ryuji's best friend (Taiga's crush) is an odd but popular student council member; and transfer student Ami serves as a rival to the tiny Taiga. Though they do not seem like anything special at first, they develop into well-rounded believable characters as the story progresses. Taiga's violent disposition becomes understandable as her numerous family problems are revealed; her tsudere tendencies are utilized convincingly to portray her as an aggressively guarded teenage girl. As energetic and weird as Minori is, she is more than just comedic relief, her hyperactive demeanor hides surprising depth. The two-faced Ami can come off as a bitch, but also has a side that is a sympathetic, and is remarkably well developed and interesting all on her own. While not as colorful in personality as the girls, Ryuji is an endearing lead whose presence never becomes bothersome. The rest of the cast is equally as likeable, though none shine as bright as the main cast.
Being in the slice-of-life genre, it is easy what to expect from Toradora visually. However, even here, the show delivers exceptionally well. Character designs are quite attractive; even though they are not particularly unconventional, there is a certain flair to them. The body language and facial expressions of each character is what brings them to life visually. Simlpy by the way they carry themselves and the way they move, it is easy to get a feel of who these characters are. Facial expressions are pivotal in conveying emotion, and it is clear Toradora's animators knew this, as they carefully handled the characters' exceptionally expressive faces to carry the subtlest of emotion.
Not to be outdone, the show's soundtrack is equally as impressive, if not even more so. While again not unconventional in the realm of slice-of-life anime, the music is magnificently composed. From the bubbly electrical pieces used in everyday school life scenes, to the fully orchestrated ones used in the show's emotional climaxes, every beat is a joy to listen to. This music is used masterfully, fitting the tone of every scene perfectly; becoming engraved with the emotion each contained. Even the transition into the charming J-pop ending themes is incredibly well done and memorable.
It is apparent that Toradora is not so much groundbreaking as it is incredibly well executed. It does not do anything especially innovative with its narrative, in fact, utilizing genre conventions. However, at the end of the day, such criticisms pale in comparison overwhelming merits of the show. It is inviting, funny, heartfelt, and overflowing with emotion. It easily stands proud among the best of its genre.",9
"
                Toradora .. it is considered one of the best romance anime of all time .. well i disagree. I only saw a couple of romances and i already saw 3 romances that for me were better than Toradora. 
Why this anime for me is over rated? Well it has nothing special to offer .. pretty usual, pretty normal, the romance is predictable, well nothing here excels in my opinion. 
Story: 7/10. I only gave a 7 to the story because we have a interesting way of starting an anime. The rest ? Clichê. Everything ! Not even one character is original, everyone are clichê and
                  not even one is interesting. I kinda guessed the end when i was in the 4th ep or so .. and I did it right, the end was just what I expected to be ... why is that? BECAUSE IT'S A ********* clichê and like every clichê out there, they are predictable and boring. But still the story is good enough.. there is no plot holes, everything fits right. 
Art: 6/10. Really really crappy art. The characters look ugly.. it seems that they just changed the size of the boobs, the hair colour and the eyes colour between the female characters. Look on the web and see if i'm not right. There is even 2 characters that i just could distinguish by hearing their voices... -.-. The background is also pretty bad. But .. the design i think it's well done after all and fits well with the character's personality. 
Sound: 8/10. Actually the best aspect here. It makes the comedy moments much more fun. The voice acting is pretty good also. The openings are funny especially the first one. About the OST, they fit nice and i found no problems on them .. Although the OST for the drama could be better .. it's pretty smooth for me xD 
Character: 8/10. Like i said they all are clichê characters .. predictable movements, predictable choices, predictable reactions .. where is the fun watching this? But i do have to say they have a nice development, all of them have a different personality and it's interesting seeing the interaction between the characters. But again, they are clichês so as their background stories. I was having a deja'vu every time they explained some character's past. 
Enjoyment: 8/10. It is a clichê .. but at least it's funny to watch and entertains well. Although .. because i already had predicted the end, the romane got extremely weak for me, and it looked pretty rough, i mean at least i don´t like that type of romance. I'm one of those who likes cute things. I can´t lie to you, i saw this anime in 3 days so i had fun while i was watching that's for sure. But it's because it is a comedy show with some drama on it. 
Overall: 7/10. I'm being generous giving this anime a 7/10. I like to get suprised and here i got everything right. To much predictable, at least for me it sucks. Although for a comedy is nice, for a slice of life is also good. But i advise you, if you heard the same as i ""Toradora is one of the best romances of all time"" .. IT'S WRONG. For me, it was just a normal romance, so it can´t be the best. So don´t get hype for then get disappointment like i had. 
If you like romance/comedy/slice of life, this is a good show .. but not one of the best romance animes. It just looks pretty normal to be one of the best.",7

                In this world, there’s this thing that no one’s ever seen.  This thing is very kind and gentle.  And if anyone could actually see it, there’d be a whole bunch of people wanting to have it.  Maybe that’s why the world keeps it hidden from everyone...  Because if it’s that hard to get, that makes it even more special.  And one day, someone will find it.  Whoever does find it, they’ll be the one that was supposed to.  Because that’s the way it’s meant to be.
Ryuji Takesu is trying to find this something...  He’s in love with
                  an energetic girl in his class, but his reputation as the second scariest student in the school has kept him at a distance from her.  One day, the first scariest student in the school slips a love note into his bag by mistake, and the two of them realize that they’re in love with each others’ best friends.  By joining forces in the pursuit of their unrequited loves, can this tiger and dragon finally find that one thing that they long to see?
Well, once again, we’re returning to JC Staff, although this series is an entirely different creature than the two shows I’ve reviewed before.  It combines the budget allocation from Ghost Hunt with the hyper-cheap aesthetic from Ookami-san to some surprisingly great effect.  It’s not what you’d call a great looking series, as movement is limited, but for the most part, the movement it DOES showcase is smooth and kinetic.  The only time it really becomes ugly is during a few of the biggest emotional moments of the show, and their attempt to get as much movement as possible out of the characters leads to frameless, poorly drawn monsters that look absolutely hilarious when paused.  But luckily, those moments are few and far between, and the high emotions involved are enough to overpower and revulsion these images may cause.
As for the artwork, it’s above average.  The character designs are brilliant, with inspired looks and bright, sharp color choices keeping the entire cast fresh in your mind for days after you finish the series, but outside of that, it’s pretty standard slice-of-life stuff.  The CG, at least in the few moments that they choose to employ it, is flawlessly done, so it’s pretty easy to pick out where a good chunk of the budget went.  The only aspect of the artwork that really bothered me were the constant jagged outlines around the characters, which is not an uncommon problem in anime from around the late aughts...  Even Brotherhood and Spice and Wolf suffered from it.  That problem is completely erased if you’re watching it on Blu-ray, however.
In any case, the show does it’s job visually, as all the extra effort in the animation makes for some impeccable comic timing, and the lighting and color scheme suddenly become gorgeous whenever there’s a romantic scene to showcase.  The facial expressions are detailed and dynamic enough to make Kyoto Animation eat it’s heart out, which is important because in a lot of ways, the characters are the most important part of the show.  The main characters... The ones who appear most prominently in the opening...  Take the standard love triangle and evolve it into a full blown love pentagon, with enough plotting and emotional nuance that each one of them is as important to the unfolding drama as the next.  
Our central character, Ryuji Takesu, is a hopeless romantic who’s been mistaken for a scary thug because of his tough face and quiet demeanor.  If that sounds familiar to you, it’s because his character was ripped off wholesale by a series that I like to call “Haganai: I Don’t Have Many Original Ideas.”  He’s the standard nice guy rom-com lead, but there’s more to him than others of his ilk...  He was raised by a very childish single parent, which lead to him becoming the responsible housewife she could never be...  He cooks, fusses, and is an obsessive neat-freak who can’t stand to let dirt or mold sit unchallenged.  His personality may not resonate with everyone, but that’s what’s so wonderful about it...  He actually has personality traits that aren’t just positive gimmicks, and the majority of the people surrounding him actually DO find him weird because of it.  He’s not the glorified perfect guy everyone loves, and after Kyo-Ani’s domination of the market, that’s pretty refreshing.
The other main character is Taiga Aisaka, a tiny girl who’s actually earned her frightful reputation.  Blunt and brutal, she’s been given the diminutive nickname “The Palmtop Tiger.”  At first glance, she may appear to be some calculated pander to the fans of the lolicon and tsundere archetypes, and I can kind of understand where people who say this are coming from.  But as the story progresses, and you learn more about her family situation, her tough nature becomes more and more understandable, and it also becomes very clear that her physical shortcomings are a thing that she has to overcompensate for.  Yeah, you can condemn her as being a shallow grab at the loli market, but the truth is, I knew plenty of girls like her in school, so it’s hard for me to become offended when one of them is very accurately represented in a story.  She’s the most complex and (ironically) the most developed character in the cast, so it makes sense that she’s become the posterchild for the series.
Their friends(and initial love interests) are Yusaku Kitamura and Minori Kushieda, two lovable oddballs who are active in a lot of school activities.  Yusaku is a relatively simple character, and in the beginning, he’s the only one who knows that Taiga and Ryuji are good people.  This probably has something to do with his involvement in student council, as he seems to be the kind of person who makes an effort to get to know everybody.  Despite being a little simple, he does have his problems, and he does get his own arc, and they don’t disappoint.  Minori is the class’s genki girl, a bright ball of energy who tries her best in everything she does, is highly perceptive of other peoples’ true feelings, and holds about a dozen jobs outside of school.  She can be annoying to some viewers, but while it’s never fully explored, it’s implied several times throughout the anime that she has a wealth of issues below the surface, and that she may secretly suffer from poverty, or even severe depression in her home life.  Whatever the case, the only ones who never really believe in her sunny exterior are herself and...
My favorite character in the show, Ami Kawashima.  When she’s introduced to the story, it’s as a sort of villain...  Or, at least, an antagonist.  She’s a bratty, arrogant model who puts on a much more manufactured, moe-like facade in order to manipulate people, and if you’re the kind of person who can’t stand all the infantilized doe-eyed ladies of the Key Trinity, you’ll be laughing right along with her over it.  As she develops, and we learn more about why she transferred to this school and why she is the way she is, she’s eventually forced to drop her act, at which point she becomes arguably the most important character in the series. She becomes an almost Shakespearian character, a fifth wheel who’s free to observe the web of lies going on between her cast mates.  She takes an active role in the story, pulling strings and making calculated comments, getting way too involved as she tries to unravel the truth behind it all.
The supporting cast is used with surprising efficiency, as none of them are featured any more or less than they need to be.  Characters like The Student council President, Inko the brain-damaged parrot, and the parents of our two central characters exist not only to augment the comedy or drama of the material, but to drop subtle hints about why the characters are the way they are.  Characters like Miss Koigakubo and four other select students exist to deliver some stunning paralells in regards to what’s going on in the main story, as well as to serve as a constant reminder that there’s a world outside of Taiga's circle.  
Toradora is one of a small list of shows that I’ve seen in both English and Japanese, and even though I may be woefully monolingual, I can personally attest to the fact that both tracks are nothing short of pure gold.  I can’t really say anything about the Japanese track that a simple list of names wouldn’t say all on it’s own, as I don’t think anybody is a virgin to the works of people like Rie Kugimiya and Yui Horie, but the English dub really doesn’t have that kind of star power, so it does merit a bit more discussion.
In recent years, Bang Zoom Entertainment has taken to pushing it’s main stable to the back row, and instead giving some of it’s best roles to a series of newer actors that haven’t gotten nearly as much work in the past.  This transition was a little rocky at first, with projects like K-On and Oblivion Island at the forefront, and some decent yet rather awkward acting in Madoka Magica.  Well, Toradora was their moment, and they rose to it, putting forth better performances than I could have possibly imagined.  They all far surpassed the relatively little work they’ve previously done, and after hearing them in this, I sincerely hope this stable becomes the next big industry powerhouse.  
Going in, I already  had respect for Cassandra Lee’s ability to understand her characters, as her performances in both K-On and Madoka Magica were outstanding, but I felt Taiga’s depth was out of her range… And I never really liked Christine Marie Cabanos, although she was decent in Squidgirl. I wasn’t initially expecting much, but this dub is literally perfect. And yes, I know what I’m implying by putting the word literally before the word perfect… Believe me, I mean it that way. I can’t imagine any cast coming together for Toradora better than this one did. All of those actors I’d never heard of before… Like Erika Herlacher and Erik Kimerer… Are names I’m going to be looking out for from now on. Cassandra Lee has only strengthened my confidence in her abilities, and as for Cabanos? I take back every negative thing I ever said about her. She is the star of this dub, and as such, I don’t want to live in a world where her performance is anything other than star-making. Every inch of her becomes Minori Kushieda, from her sunny and boisterous exterior all the way down to her complex, insecure interior.  She’s apparently found her niche in loud, energetic characters, so I hope she keeps getting roles like that one.
There are a handful of seasoned veterans among the cast, with Johnny Yong Bosch and Karen Strassman pulling off performances that are about what you’d expect from them...  Which is a good thing, mind you.  And even though she’s playing multiple second-string roles, like that weird parrot-thing, Wendee Lee hasn’t sounded this good since Cowboy Bebop.
So, right from the first episode, or just from a simple explanation of the plot, most viewers will give this show a dismissive wave and say that it sounds too predictable.  “Okay, so they’re in love with each others’ best friends, but they’re going to wind up falling in love with each other, right?”  I have literally sat and watched this with a first time viewer who said pretty much this, and then throw his hands up in defeat after about eight episodes of NOTHING going the way he predicted it would.  And that’s part of the genius of this series.  The characters are familiar, the tropes are familiar, the setting is familiar, but none of it is ever played the way you’d expect it to be played.  Take any problem that the romantic comedy/harem genre may have, and Toradora either avoids it completely or turns it upside down.
For example, there’s the harem aspet.  It’s a trend in way too many shows that nearly every female character in the cast will inexplicably fall head over heels in love with the male protagonist, ignoring all other options as not being main enough for them.  This is one of the biggest issues I had with Sword Art Online and Clannad, but it’s not just a numbers issue...  In Tiger and Bunny, the main character had ONE girl fawning over him, and it was still bugged me by being completely unexplained.  In Toradora, yes, the three main girls have feelings for Ryuji, but there are a few things that set this series apart...  First off, it’s only those three characters.  Second, all three of these love interests are explained in story, either explicitly or with subtlety, and they’re all played out differently.  And finally, Ryuji’s not the only eligible bachelor in the show...  His friend Yusaku gets just as much attention, and hell, the first character in the named cast to get a significant other is one of their classmates!
Another example is that in most harem shows, particularly the ones adapted from dating games (Which Toradora thankfully wasn’t), the story seems disjointed, as each character gets their own arc while the main relationship just sits on the backburner until all the filler is done and the writers are damn well good and ready to just get to the point already.  But Toradora’s story is, however, VERY tightly written.  There is not a single story arc in the single freaking series that doesn’t somehow involve Taiga and Ryuji and their ever-developing dynamic, nor does the central plot ever get forgotten.  The other three mains may occasionally take a backseat, but they never disappear from a story completely.  
Hell, when you get down to it, all the little things that make up your typical romantic comedy are here...  But they’re used in new, clever, often subversive ways that are never just there for the sake of being checked off of a tropes list.  Everything that you’d expect to see in a show like this...  From bathing suit shopping to the obligatory beach episode...  Is executed in a way that’s fresh, unique, and important to the story.  Hell, where most anime are happy to settle on a cafe or a haunted house for their culture fest episode, Toradora goes balls-out with a professional wrestling show, complete with faces, heels, an over-the-top script and choreographed in-ring action!  We never see any characters in the bath, because no matter what a lot of other shows may think, no on screen conversation ever NEEDS to take place in the bath.  There’s a little bit of fanservice, but it’s never gratuitous...  Except for a dream that one of the side characters has right before the Christmas arc, which was funny enough to be excusable...  And it’s offset by a heaping helping of manservice, often willingly supplied by the unnervingly confident Yusaku, and even then, it’s played entirely for laughs.  
But if I had to pick out one thing that makes this series stand out over the tops of all the other rom-coms out there, it would be exactly that...  Confidence.  Toradora is one hundred percent confident in the quality of the material it has to offer, and unlike a lot of other shows that value enthusiasm over ability, it’s smart enough to know that it’s confidence is well founded.  It never doubts itself, nor does it ever assume that YOU doubt it, and it never slows down or breaks it’s outstanding pace to try and convince you otherwise.  It’s this confidence that gives Toradora it’s energy.  Well, that, and the amazing soundtrack.
Toradora has an unwavering, dazzling energy just radiating from it at every moment of screen time.  That energy never goes away, even during the more tear-jerking scenes, because it never screws around...  Instead of pop culture references, Toradora casually rolls out references and metaphors related to it’s own universe.  Where there are plenty of anime that fall into the trap of stopping their stories dead to show you backstory episodes you don’t care about for characters who are just going to fade into the background afterwards...  His and Her Circumstances was particularly bad about this...  Toradora doesn’t, because it knows that you’ll care about the characters anyway.  It never does anything just because it feels like it should, nor does it ever show us anything just because we might want to see it.  The only time it really slows down is towards the end, and it only does it then because it has one hell of a perfect post-credits ending to close on.
Toradora was originally released on a pair of undubbed DVDs by Sentai Filmworks, and while those DVDs were just fine and dandy...  Once again, the sub is great all on it’s own...  I would still highly recommend purchasing the DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack that was released last year by NIS America.  It’s pricey, but it comes with a full color fan book and a generous helping of special features, including the cute and charming Hooray for Foodies mini-sodes.  It also comes with a short video of some of the impressions that Taiga made Ami do, and a dubbed OVA episode about the magic of making bento boxes, but I’ll be honest, they were both kind of disappointing.  The OVA wasn’t necessarily bad, but it would have dragged down the series if it had actually been included.  You can also stream the entire series, in either language, on Crunchyroll!
Toradora isn’t just great, it’s glowing.  With the exception of the animation, which is at the very least better than it has any right to be, there is nothing this series does wrong.  At twenty five episodes long, it’s as fun to rewatch as any other show with half the episode count.  The high rewatch quality doesn’t stop there, either, as the comedic and dramatic material are both so effective and so timeless that I still found myself constantly laughing and choking up after seven entire viewings.  It takes some of the worst things about the romantic comedy and harem genres and proves just how amazing those things can become with a little bit of effort, focus, and tender loving care.  I won’t say whether or not the characters found that mysterious ‘thing’ they were looking for, but I found what I was looking for...  The best anime romantic comedy ever made.  I give Toradora a 10/10.",10
"
                Toradora is easily one of the worst anime around. It can't decide if its a romance/comedy or a romance/drama. Combine that with some of the worst characters ever and you have the final product.
Story:
The story is bland. It has been done so many times before the word cliché doesn't do it justice. You know the ending within the first 5 minutes of episode 1. 
It is very slow-paced. A 25 episode series that could have very easily been done in 15. It spends time on pointless scenes that are irrelevant to the main series and feel more like a filler episode of a popular long-running
                  shounen.
I will admit, the comedy scenes at the beginning were funny. However, an intelligent viewer will quickly realise the comedy is playing off of the female MC's tsundere archetype and the jokes become painful to watch. 
The drama was forced and melodramatic, especially for a series not even tagged as a drama on MAL. The feeble attempts to provoke an emotional response were poorly written and painful to watch.
Art:
The animation isn't bad but it isn't good. The backgrounds are decent but there is nothing particularly memorable regarding the art.
Sound:
The series use two opening themes which would have been very fitting if it hadn't had so much melodrama which makes the themes seem more suitable for a series with more comedy.
The OST is average at best. The composer didn't really have his own style which made the music seem bland and uninspired. 
Some of the songs fit the scene but you won't notice them unless you focus on the music.
Character:
The worst part of Toradora.
The male MC is a teenager who is isolated from his class mates because of his appearance. You know who else doesn't have any friends? Otaku.
He is too shy to tell a girl he likes her. You know who else is very shy? Otaku.
You can see where I am going with this.
The male MC is basically otaku-pandering.
I also view the MC as being a poor rip-off of Clannad's male MC. They both have few friends and are considered delinquents and both have blue hair. 
The female MC is easily the worst character ever written. She is the personification of the tsundere archetype which shows poor writing and a lack of creativity of the author's part. By the time the show gets started on her character development you already hate her so much you don't care. Additionally, all her issues in the show could be resolved if she stopped being a bitch. Her voice actor only makes matters worse. Its Rie Kugimiya, need I say more?
The side character are a mixed bag. Minori is just as bad as Taiga but for different reasons. Namely a bipolar personality and generally being an annoyance. The other two ,Kitamura and Ami, are actually decent but are thrown to the side for the worse characters.
Enjoyment:
It took me two months to finish this, purely because I don't drop shows. I felt my IQ getting lower as I watched each episode. It isn't enjoyable. I'm certain that listening to Rie Kugimiya's voice is a method of torture at guantanamo bay.
Overall:
It could have been a decent show if the story wasn't so cliché and the characters weren't so poorly written. It had some good scenes that were held back by reasons previously stated. Scenes that seem significant later become redundant and everything is so predictable. As a fan of the romance genre I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",2

                I realize writing a preliminary review for a series that at this point is 12 years old is pointless. Especially given that Toraodra has a reputation attached to it that’s never going to change. But I don’t fucking care, I feel as if I don’t write a review and get my thoughts out there in some capacity, I’m gonna go mental or some shit. Regardless, consider this my hate letter to Toradora, my least favorite anime of all time. I can certainly think of worse shows, but I can’t think of a series that I absolutely detest to the level I do this one. You
                  could sum up every hater in the world of my top 10 anime, put me in a room with them, and they still wouldn’t compare to the utter disdain I house for this series, without further ado let’s get this out of the way so I can hopefully not think about this series anymore unless it’s gets brought up in conversation.
Reason I hate Toradora #1: The art
I fucking hate the art of this series, the overall presentation is a blurry mess & the colors are drab overall. I also hate the uniform designs for the girls. I have nothing against the color red, but the way the uniforms stand out from the background (which I get is the point), something about it just pisses me off to no end, I’m not sure if it’s the kind of red they used or what, but I think it looks ugly. Speaking of ugly, the character designs, holy fuck are these character designs hideous. They’re either incredibly basic & look like very little effort went into them. Either that or they just look like your typical light novel character (which yes, I do know Toradora was a light novel adaptation) with absolutely no deviation, Taiga’s hair going all the way down to her back certainly checks out here. Honest to god I think the character design from Garzey’s Wing is 100000x times more appealing than the character designs in Toradora, because I at least don’t get disgusted whenever I look at them. Garzey’s Wing also doesn’t rely on the tried & true tactic of giving all their main characters different hair color to make them stand out. I don’t think Toradora using multiple hair colors is an inherently bad thing to be honest, after all shows like Gurren Lagann exist & I believe that series to have excellent character designs. But where Gurren Succeeded where Toradora fails is that Gurren’s characters don’t look like designs ripped out of every light novel ever made. The colors in Gurren are also rich with detail where as I mentioned earlier, the colors in Toradora are drab, bleak, and shitty.
Reason I hate Toradora #2: Comedy
Toradora has got to be the most obnoxious and unfunny series I have ever seen. The comedy relies almost entirely on nothing but random nonsense & Taiga being small but fierce, which wasn’t funny the first time, & isn’t funny any time after that. Toradora also doesn’t do toneshifts well. Comedy will usually come after a very dramatic sequence of events, sort of similar to 3-gatsu no lion. As ashamed of myself as I am that I just put 3-gatsu on the level of Toradora for a quick second, I’m about to lay my shame to rest by explaining why 3-gatsu works and why Toradora fails. 3-gatsu works because there’s build up to the more comedic & lighthearted scenes of the series after all the tense character drama. Once the character drama in 3-gatsu is over the series will usually create an establishing shot or use a line of dialogue that will lead into preparing the viewer for the comedic scene so that it doesn’t feel out of nowhere. In Toradora on the other hand, there is almost never an establishing moment for such a thing, so the tone-shift just feels like it comes out of nowhere & makes the scenes awkward and all the dramatic tension that could’ve been had is now gone thanks to the bad tone-shifts. Toradora also has a certain red-haired bitch who I will mention later in the review later on to use for comedy, but it never goes anything beyond the most stereotypical and exaggerated air headed character in anime history. To sum up why I hate Toradora’s comedy in 3 words ‘Annoying”, ‘Random”, “Over Exaggerated”.
Reason I hate Toradora #3 The characters
I HATE Toradora’s characters. I used to think Ranma ½ had the most annoying cast of characters in all of anime, but that cast is fucking child’s play in comparison to the absolute rubbish that are the cast of characters from Toradora. I’ll go over the ones that stood out.
Taiga-A.K.A the worst Tsundere of all time. I’ve come to the conclusion recently that I don’t hate Tsundere’s as much as I thought I did. Mainly because Miss Senjougahara from the Monogatari franchise opened my eyes. Taiga isn’t Senjougahara however, as Taiga’s character traits are overexaggerated to the point where her character loses any and all sincerity that could have potentially been had for the character. The reason Senjo works is because Senjo is actually a deep character with things that stress her out, concern her, & things that bring her down. While Taiga does have these things, Toradora will bring these things onto the playing field, and then after all of it is said and done, they throw it away for a single unfunny gag revolving in Taiga either being short, hitting people, or being an annoying ass. Her character design is also hideous for reasons I’ve already mentioned, so she can’t even have the decency to have an appealing character design at the very least.
Ryugi-Ryugi is tolerable but he’s a blank-slate. He pretty much does nothing but go along with Taiga questioning nothing. There is something about him not liking how he likes his dad because if I recall his Father wasn’t a very good person & mistreated his mother. But Ryugi almost never seems affected by this at all, the only time I remember him being even remotely affected by this was in episode 1 when his mom accidentally brought it up, he got angry about it. Rugi’s character design is also incredibly basic, but at least it’s bearable to look at unlike Taiga’s. I do feel some level of sympathy for the poor guy, but that’s only because he has to live in Toradora’s world.
Minori-Minori the airhead……. and nothing else. Minori’s entire character is based off her being the happy-go-lucky character in a sea of more stressed (for lack of a better term) characters. The whole schtick is that she’s supposed to be a contrast, which could work, except her character trait is overexaggerated to a point where it becomes annoying above all else, the moments themselves follow Toradora’s random, loud nature to  how it writes comedy for its character, so that’s another aspect that adds to how annoying the series is. I also forgot to mention her voice is incredibly grating overtime as well, this voice actor must be shit, I wonder who it is. Wait a second, Horie Yui, the voice actress of Tsubasa Hanekwawa from Monogatari? NOOOOOOO, I really hope they paid you well to work on this abomination, you did not deserve to have your talents wasted on such an abhorrent series like this.
As for the rest of their characters, they aren’t as annoying as Minori and Taiga, but they’re pretty one note and have nothing going for them, and no, whatever character arc they may go through later on in the series isn’t going to change my mind on what I think about these characters, I can almost guarantee that their overexaggerated character traits would make the arcs lose any of their weight & sincerity that they may have anyway, nor do I think it will redeem any of them from how awful they were in the 5 episodes I was unfortunate enough to watch.
So that's my 3 reasons wh Toradora is my least favorite anime of all time. I did skimp some details like how the show is directed (which spoiler alert, isn’t good, it’s very flat overall), the story (which is ok, it’s a typical rom-com story but I don’t mind it), and the animation (which is as shitty as the art is). But I’m just fucking sick of it overall, I feel ashamed of myself for watching Toradora & wish I could erase it from my mind, it’s thus-far the only anime I regret watching, mainly because, I knew Toradora was gonna be shit from the first episode when I saw how they handled an opportunity to portray something like Ryugi being misunderstood as a bully, instead of doing something like turning it into a serious character moment that could develop Ryugi later on, they instead waste it on an overexaggerated, unfunny series of gags, fuck you Mari Okada. In conclusion, Toradora is my least favorite anime of all time, and I hope this review will at least get me to stop thinking about the series unless it gets brought up in conversation now that my thoughts are out there for the world to see in some capacity. The series gets, do I really need to say it? A 1, out of fucking, 10.",1

                This is just too cute.
Oh just thinking about this series makes me want to get in a relationship and do some lovey dovey stuff. DAMN THE REALISTIC WORLD. 
-Insert forever alone meme-
Good high school romantic comedies can be a lot of fun to watch. The bad ones, on the other hand, have the tendency to annoy viewers with tired clichés and are often neither romantic nor funny. Without a doubt, the anime title Toradora! falls into the first category. It not only contains some touching romance and hilarious comedy, but is also beautifully animated and cleverly scripted, making it a highly energetic and entertaining series.
                  
Takasu Ryuuji dislikes the way his eyes look: menacing and rebellious. It is the first day of his second year in high school, and he is trying to change his appearance to match his kind personality. At school, Ryuuji bumps into a short girl who is known for bringing trouble, Aisaka Taiga. After a long turn of events, Taiga reveals that she likes Kitamura Yuusaku, one of Ryuuji’s few friends and Ryuuji then reciprocates by revealing to her that he likes Taiga’s friend, Kushieda Minori. They decide to make a pact in which Taiga will help Ryuuji confess to Minori if he becomes her “dog”.
The character designs on the whole are simple but attractive, and each each character's animation helps to communicate his or her personality: Ryuuji's slumped posture, Minori's exuberance, and Ami's haughty cool can be read equally well from their body language as from their dialogue. Far and away, the most visual sugar gets sprinkled on Aisaka Taiga; whether she be sleeping, toweling her hair, or using a doughnut as a halo, she looks fantastic.
Sound-wise, you have catchy opening and ending themes set alongside beautifully animated sequences. It's all a beautiful riot of colors and is extremely well-timed. The BGM is alright in my opinion; there's a few memorable pieces such several piano themes and guitar pieces that really compliment a few of scenes. They bring out the emotions of the characters and really strike the feeling home. Otherwise, the music didn't catch my attention too much. The voice acting is extremely well done, delivering the dialogues with all the right emotions.
I could go on and on about the characters but I'll try to keep it brief. The personalities and interactions of the characters really brings this entire show above the normal threshold for such a genre. Though they seem cookie-cutter in the beginning, it quickly changes as the story continues and they gain a level of depth and believability. You become so invested in their endeavors and become invested in their goals, especially in Ryūji and Taiga. The side characters are a little more predictable, but they each have their levels of depth that make the show enjoyable to watch
To put it simply, Toradora is a good anime. There's a great mix between comedy and romance, although sometimes the melodrama could be over the top if you're not used to it. The pacing of the story is done well and the cast of characters are charming and entertaining to watch. One gripe would probably be that the ending left a little more to be desired. It was a little out of the blue and for a second I was worried that the characters would make all the wrong choices but they pulled through in the end!
The people I've seen talk about Toradora! tend to get fixated on either half of the show, which is a horrible mistake. Taken as a whole, this work's honesty and humor paints a picture of high school romance and heartbreak that rings true. The loving, detailed visuals, laid back atmosphere and modest scope make the series a perfect introduction to the romance genre and a standout anime in its own right. No matter how angry it makes me at one moment, the next scene or episode has me singing its praises. In short, Toradora! is a lot like it's subject matter: In turns hilarious, rambling, confused, charming, and foolish, but ultimately a worthwhile and heartwarming experience. 
Well, I'd better get back to my seat. The unmarried woman with her unmarried face is about to come to start the unmarried homeroom.",7
"
                [Spoilers Mates] I have had my Toradora box set sitting on my shelf since 2012 or 13. I've had the VN for the PSP sitting around for years too, I have no idea why it took me so long to watch and finish this amazing show but god damn was it worth it.
Now with the story let me start off by saying I was really impressed with the pacing, romance and drama in the story. I mean, it  was unfortunately too predictable for me however that did not stop it from being great. I liked that no matter what episode I was watching there
                  was always a sense of joy and a little bit of wonder. I'd always be thinking to myself ""Hmm, I wonder what antics Ryuji and Taiga are going to try to get closer to the ones they allegedly love."" Now, there were numerous moments that I was disappointed about. From the first or second episode when Taiga confesses and gets friend-zoned by Yuusaku it's a dead give away from her speech about Ryuji that she may have already fallen for him. I was disappointed about that because I felt that it was too early for that to be established. Additional moments that  made it predictable and a bit less enjoyable or less suspenseful for me was that after Ryuji's mother calls Taiga family, and lastly, more importantly is how they both go so far to support each others unrequited love.
Moving on from the story the artwork and most character designs are pretty good, especially for it's time. I think the only character's whose character designs I didn't care for was Ryuji. I'm not going to complain to much though because his character was supposed to be the delinquent type and the eyes, giving him such evil looking eyes and messy-ish hair work in that sense. Soundtrack... meh, only one good song that stood out for me and that was the track played when something sad or emotional was occurring. I'm a sucker for piano songs.
Characters were pretty amazing for the most part! I liked the relationships between the main and supporting characters, I felt like no characters were wasted. Even the background characters like Ryuji's friends. It was like every character had a purpose in the show and that's something I always like to see. Characters being put to good use even if they are people you don't really care about.
Toradora! was totally an enjoyable experience for me in some sense. I would recommend it to those who are more or less new to romance series. This is because as I mentioned earlier, it's really predictable and that easy predictability can really take away the enjoyment of the show.
Overall I have to give Toradora! 8/10 because while the story wasn't it's strong point the bond between the characters is something that makes it greater!",8
"
                Toradora is based off of some romantic comedy light novels written by Takemiya Yuyuko. From October '08 to March '09, an anime adaptation aired. It was brought to us by J.C. Staff, the same studio behind Shakugan no Shana, Yami no Matsuei & Hachimitsu to Clover. So, this could be terrible, really good or bland, based on that. The anime version's writer doesn't help narrow things down either. It was handled by Okada Mari. She's worked on such anime as Canaan & Kuroshitsuji II. So, let's take a  look and see if this is one of J.C's better works, or at least entertainingly bad
                  like their work on Garzey no Tsubasa. 
Story:
Ryuuji  has romantic feelings for his classmate, Kushieda. Kushieda's best friend, Taiga, has a crush on Ryuuji's best friend, Kitamura. A fact that Ryuuji learns when she mistakenly leaves  love letter in his bag. Ryuuji and Taiga become friends, planning to help one another in order to make their romantic dreams come true. Next stop, shenanigans. 
The biggest flaw with the series is that its relatively unique set up for a rom-com becomes progressively more clichéd and predictable as the series progresses. In fact, a lot of you will be able to guess how the series ends just from applying romantic comedy logic to that short description. It's a shame because the early stuff can be fairly amusing. The series also has its share of always so “wonderful” jokes about a girl hitting a guy. Although, in all fairness, they aren't as prevalent in Toradora as they are in certain other series. The main romance is also quite bad with a convoluted love... heptagon... no, hexagon and with several overly melodramatic moments leading up to it.
Moving on to the positives. To reiterate, the early episodes are pretty entertaining and there are some genuinely funny moments in there with clever set ups and good pay offs. Seeing Ryuuji and Taiga try to help one another leads to quite a few good jokes. 
Characters:
The characters in this aren't particularly complex, but they're perfectly functional for a comedic series and most of the main cast get their share of good comedic moments. Where the series really excels is with the developing friendship between Ryuuji and Taiga early on. Although, the series sets about ruining it in the second half. 
Art:
The animation in this is pretty good. Granted, they don't have to do much with it since most of the series takes place in a rather generic townscape and at a rather generic school, but it has some strong details and the characters do look unique. The series also has some success at using lighting to set the mood at various points. It's a nice little detail. 
Sound:
They got some good actors for this series. Kugimiya Rie, Majima Junji, Horie Yui, Nojima Hirofumi & Kitamura Eri are all fine actors. I won't claim that Toradora shows any of them at their absolute best, but there's enough for them to work with that they can show their skills. The music is pretty mediocre. There's nothing that really sets it apart from the music of any other romantic comedy. 
Ho-yay:
There are points in the story where it definitely seems like Kushieda has feelings beyond friendship for Taiga. But as the series continues and becomes more trite, it becomes apparent that that isn't the case. 
Final Thoughts:
Toradora is a series with a strong start. In the beginning, it has a lot going for it. A legitimately different premise. Some strong comedic scenes. A good dynamic betwixt Ryuuji and Taiga. However, as the series progresses it gradually eliminates all of that. It tosses  it away to make things, to be completely frank, boring and generic. Instead of taking some risks, Takemiya decides to play it the safe, dull route we've seen in every romantic comedy ever made. As a result, the series squanders its early good will and ends things on a disappointing note. I sill wouldn't call it a bad series but I would say it ends up being as mediocre as Hachimitsu to Clover. My final rating is a 5/10. If you really like the standard rom-com clichés, you'll probably like it throughout. If you want something unique in any way you'll spend the first half of the series thinking “this could work if they don't decide to bog it down with obvious clichés” and the second half pressing your palm against your face a lot. Next week I'll look at Sword Art Online II.",5
"
                As we dash forward to chase our ideals, we may eventually realize that what we were chasing was beside us this whole time.
That is the basic premise that Toradora builds its story upon. Although Toradora is a rom com, the story line is not your typical rom com plot line. Our two main characters, Ryuji and Taiga, help each other get matched up with the other's friend. Furthermore, Taiga, for some reason, does not know how to take care of herself so it's up to Ryuji to make sure Taiga eats well and lives like a human. Obviously, it's inevitable that they will grow closer
                  together. I enjoyed the fact that we don't have the main characters ""coincidentally"" encounter each other and develop feelings for one other that way. Instead, Toradora makes it so that we always see our couple together, scheming how they should get the guy/girl of their dreams.  
As you begin watching the show, you may realize that it's mainly funny moments with Taiga and Ryuji and that the romance is meh. But as you move into the second half of Toradora, the comedic elements begin to take second wheel and the romantic elements take center stage. I assure that it's a great feels trip. If you haven't been rooting for a character at this point, the story will convince you to root for someone. I definitely would say that the second half of Toradora is the best part of the entire anime and what makes it endearing for so long.
In Toradora, we have Ryuji as the male lead who is often mistaken to be a goon but in fact, deep down, he is a very caring guy (who is also a clean freak). Taiga is our main female lead. Aptly nicknamed ""Palmtop Tiger,"" she is someone who is not afraid to let her fists do the talking. For our ""secondary"" characters, we have Minori (Ryuji's crush), Kitamura (Taiga's crush), and Ami, a model who is an acquaintance of Kitamura. Although I label these three as ""secondary"" characters, they get ample screen time and a lot of development. This is another aspect that Toradora does well. The writers did not abandon them. Rather, Minori, Kitamura, and Ami are essential characters to the story but they don't take away our desire to see the developing chemistry between Taiga and Ryuji.
The only troubling aspect of Toradora is that at times, I found myself extremely frustrated because the characters can't either express themselves or seem oblivious to the feelings of others. Indeed, these are things that happen in real relationships, which makes Toradora very relatable, but since the anime is a rom com, this element doesn't mesh well with the genre.
The sound was fairly good. There were a few emotional scenes where the music helped bring out my emotions but other than that, the background music was alright. However, it was not intrusive in any way and was well-composed for the situation. The voice actors brought out the unique characteristics of each character and did a wonderful job. 
I didn't quite like the opening and ending themes to Toradora. Although the beat of the first opening is pretty cool, I found the opening did not match the atmosphere of Toradora. 
The artwork was good. There were some scenes where the colours were very rich and captured the mood really well. In general, Toradora leans on a vibrant colour palette. I felt that the character designs were a little simple. For example, Ami isn't drawn like a model as she should be so without telling you she's a model, you will think of her as just another student.
Although I don't think Toradora lived up to its hype, I enjoyed the anime. Since Taiga is the Queen of Tsunderes, you should have Toradora on your anime list (otherwise, she may come at night and hit you with her wooden katana). Even if you aren't a big Tsundere fan but still enjoy rom coms, you  should have Toradora on your list because it is a very memorable anime. 
I definitely would tell you to check out Toradora! Let me know what you liked or disliked about this anime. Was it over-hyped? Was the ending spot on? I would love to hear from you!",8
"
                Just from reading the synopsis and glancing over a few of the scores this anime received, I decided not to watch to it. One day I was in the mood for a romance and decided to check out Toradora! again, this time reading through several of the reviews. And, in all honesty, if I hadn't, I probably would have dropped the anime after the first few episodes. Yet, the promises that it would get a lot better by around episode six kept me watching. That, plus the fact that so many of the reviewers like it so much. It was also said to be similar
                  to Lovely Complex, which it wasn't. At all. 
Story/Characters; 
It goes like this: Meet cute, crazy stuff, they work together and develop a sort of abusive friendship, then a lot, lot, lot of crazy stuff happens, not just with the two main characters, but also with the majority of the supporting characters. This anime makes sure to focus on everyone in the anime -- and nobody in class 2-C seems to have a boring life. 
A lot of people seemed to rate this anime lower than they would have liked to due to predictability. If that is something that turns you off, then in my opinion, you should totally watch this anime. It was one of the least predictable animes I have ever watched. Sure, you think you know what is going to happen (and what obviously is supposed to happen) at the start, but then everything goes haywire and you are left with several different options. And all of them have a very, very likely chance of being correct. Until the very end, each option is given enough supporting evidence to be proven a valid guess. I promise you, it is very unlikely that you will know what will happen next in this story. If anything, you will be dying to know or pissed off because all of your assumptions were incorrect. 
Now, I didn't like the story of this anime so much. Although it seemed obvious that they will be happiest together, I feel like Taiga and Ryuuji are an odd couple. Taiga is pretty abusive towards Ryuuji throughout the show, and a lot of the time I felt like he deserved better. They are both pretty selfish characters in their own way, as well. I never felt like they really belonged together. They seemed to be perfect best friends for each other, but no more than that. While watching the show, I really did get the sense of a father/daughter relationship between them, instead of two classmates and peers. That didn't really appeal to me.
Most romantic animes really let you see inside the characters' heads and into their hearts. This show doesn't do that. At the end, you will find that there is a lot that you didn't know about the characters -- things that could have completely changed your feelings about the show had they been introduced earlier. Instead of feeling like someone watching the lives of these characters play out before you, you almost just feel like an invisible person sitting in their classrooms and sometimes following the characters around. Like a stalker. Not a fan of the show, but a stalker. Although that does sound very nice, it does help you feel like you are a part of the characters' lives. You learn things just as slowly as any involved fellow classmate would. 
Now for a hardcore romance fan like myself, this story like may seem very tedious and hard to get through, for the romantic progression is very slow. It's there, but it is dragging along to the point where you may feel like skipping a few episodes in order to find out if the pace will ever speed up. I am here to tell you that it does. For about the last five or six episodes, it does. And what you get in those last episodes isn't really enough to endure for. For those who love humor, I didn't really feel like this show was great for that either. I didn't really find myself laughing a lot. Then again, that may just be because everything else is so consuming that I didn't really pay attention to any possible humor. 
Now, the characters in this show are pretty...amazing, to say the least. They all of have depth and each one could easily have at least a mediocre level anime set around them. Each character is very important to the show, as you will see if you watch it. They take up some screen time, but because of the time and effort put into their character development, that screen time is very enjoyable to watch. I was never frustrated when episodes focused on another character more often than Taiga and Ryuuji. Each character also has a nice air of mystery around them, which I feel added to the show's overall enjoyability.
While many people say that this is one of the best animes that they have ever watched, I disagree. Surely it is memorable because of how original it is and because of the ending, but not because I was blown away by it. The ending wasn't enough to make up for the other 20 or so episodes. 
Art/Sound; 
The art in Toradora! was pretty unique. It's memorable for being different, just like the rest of the show. The coloring is pretty arrogant, but very eye-catching. The action scenes are drawn very well, though. They were very good about keeping proportions throughout the show. Now, while things were accurate, all of the detail seemed to be focused on the eyes of the characters -- which were some of the best I have ever seen. Although at times the eyes just seemed to take over their entire face, I didn't find it to be too distracting. The facial expressions were amazing as well. You could really feel what the character's felt just by looking at their intense and masterfully drawn expressions. 
I did love the music for the anime, though. Both the EDs and the OPs were very nice. I believe that I will be listening to them for quite some time. I also really liked the fact that the voice actors sang the songs. It helped me really connect to the show. 
Conclusion;
I wouldn't recommend this to a friend, but I wouldn't tell them it would be a waste of their time to watch it if they felt like it. I don't feel like this anime held up to all the astounding reviews it had, but it also didn't hold up for all the weak points other reviewers suggested, in my mind. It is a very memorable show, but only because it is different and what you think will happen doesn't really happens -- this show really manages to shock you very frequently. This show is a lot more about friendship than it is about romance, in my opinion. 
Should I watch it?;
If you are in the mood for a dramatic romance, or a hysterical romantic comedy, that has a predictable plot line and focuses on the ups and downs of one relationship and lets you see into the hearts of the characters -- a show that talks about how high school life fits into a romance, one that has a nice shoujo art style and really helps you feel for the characters, I suggest you find something else. On the other hand, if you want to watch a nice coming-of-age story, one that deals with friendship a lot more than it does romance, one that focuses on the difficulties of finding and accepting yourself while still pleasing others, and is about finding those that mean a lot to you and filling a void in your life -- one that has a not-so-normal couple and a lot of love possibilities (and a lot of possibility in general), one that gives each character a lot of depth, mystery, and some adequate screen time, and one that makes you feel like a part of the story and is a pretty memorable tale, then this is for you.",7

Minori Kushieda Toradora.
Toradora is a special anime for me. It was not of the two anime that introduced me to the rom-com genre back in 2012 the other one being Clannad but it was the first romcom anime that I ever loved. I loved it so much that when I eventually started to buy animes DVDs back in 2015 Toradora was the third anime I purchased. From that point on I re-watched Toradora least 2 to 3 times per year and I still love it
                  even if it had some flaws that I started to notice on my last re-watch of it. Now unlike Clannad where my opinion of that show worst as years went on to a point, I haven’t touched my Season 1 and After Story DVD sets for almost a year thanks to me having a low value of the series due to it serious killing flaws. My opinion on Toradora has stayed positive to this day despite its minor flaws I still think Toradora is the best modern romcom anime to ever come out.
So what made Toradora so special.
Why do I still love this show to this day?
Well let's find out, shall we?
The story follows Ryuji Takasu who is getting ready for his second year at high school. Despite being an overall nice guy he has a mistaking reputation for looking like a delinquent thanks to he evil looking eyes as well as his facial structure looking like a young yakuza member rather than a high school student. His best friend Yuusaku as well his crush Minori (whom he is too bashful to approach) are the only two people who actually don’t mind his evil looking eye appearance. Soon by complete accident, he bumps into a main female lead and tsundere Taiga Aisaka aka the Palmtop Tiger.
After an accidental first encounter that ends with Taiga KO-ing him in the face, Ryuuji finds out at the end of the school day that Taiga has put a love letter to Kitamura (whom she has a crush on but is too bashful to approach) in his bag by accident. This leads to Taiga breaking into his house that night to retrieve the letter by killing him with a bamboo sword only to discover that she forgot to put the letter in the envelope and has inadvertently outed her crush on Kitamura to Ryuuji.
After much ado and a few sword-blows, Ryuuji and Taiga strike a tenuous deal to use their positions as The Best Friends to help each other bag their respective crushes.
Now the story of Toradora may be very simple in nature but the execution is downright amazing.
Right out the bat, the show makes a great first impression as the first episode does a wonderful job at establishing the setting, tone, characters, and themes of the show. The show also knows what it wants as it says true to its roots as a slice of life, drama romcom series without being something that is not.
The show does a brilliant job of exploring the themes and topics of running away, true love, being your true self, breaking your shell and it does them all great.
The show also does a great job at keeping the audience with all the story events that happen in the show by having great writing and for the most part great overall pacing.
The characters in Toradora are all fantastic.
Ryuji is a great male lead. He may appear as this generic delinquent who hates everyone with that Yakuza look but he’s actually a nice and friendly guy who care for others. He also an obsessive neat freak where he doesn’t like messy houses and he would go out of his way to clean everything that he can. The best example of this was when Ryuji enters Taiga house for the first time. Despite Ryuiji having great personality traits he’s is a well-developed character who has great character chemistry with the cast especially Taiga.
Taiga despite being the queen of tsundere is actually a pretty great character. From start to finish I liked her character development as her interactions towards the rest of the cast. She may appear as this Lousie and Shana but unlike Lousie and at times Shana where they are tsundere for the sake for it Taiga’s tsundere behaviour rarely mirror her true feelings.
She may not be for everyone but if you can pass her tsundere side you will start to see how humanly flawed Taiga is as a person.
If I had to pick my favourite character in Toradora it would be Minori. 
She is a sweet and upbeat person who loves to keep everybody happy but there’s a lot than that. In order for her to cope with own internal struggles and loneliness, she plays softball as well as working on a series of part-time jobs. Her character development in the series was great and I really loved every scene that she’s was in. Overall brilliant character.
Now we have Kitamura Taiga crush and Ryuji best friend. Not gonna lie I thought I Kitamaru was pretty bland in the beginning as he just came as this typical smart guy chararters. Thankfully he does become a much better character as the series as he had a great character arc that was well told and it had a satisfying conclusion.
Finally, we have Ami who is a childhood friend of Kitamura who before transferring schools, she was a fashion designer. 
She may start off as this typical fan-service character but there is much more to her. In school, she plays a facade where she behaves as this cute and ditzy girl but she’s actually a mean and spoiled bitch. I honestly really loved this character. She’s probably my second favourite character in the show only losing to Minori. She is just is a joy to watch every-time she was on screen especially in the end of her character arc where she confronts the guy who takes pictures of her by smashing his camera while giving that devious look to him.
The side characters are good for what they were but apart from Yuri and Sumire the side characters are not as memorable as the mains.
I could go on and on how great this anime is sadly I have to talk about the show’s flaws because there are only two of them.
For starters, I didn’t like the portrayal of Ryuji mom where she doesn’t really behave an adult figure where instead of being a prideful or strick mother she often behaves like a kid who lazy and constantly have parties while the child always picks up all the things for them. Am not saying that Adults cannot have any fun whatsoever because I believe that all adults should have fun when are not working but Ryuji mother doesn’t feel like a responsible mother at all. As much I liked how Ryuji mother aspects Taiga as a family member she doesn’t really set any rules or do anything that a mother should do.
The second and final minor flaw is its predictable nature. Personally, I don’t mind if a show is predictable in nature because as long if it’s written well I can completely ignore its predictable nature and thankfully Toradora, for the most part, is a great ride that I enjoyed even it’s predictable. However if you a person who is not a fan of predictable stories than this show will most likely won’t like this show especially when certain scenes in Toradora actually highlight the end of the show before you even get there.
Other than the two minor flaws which I just mentioned the story and characters in Toradora was amazing.
J.C Staff is known to have great art in the shows that the make and Toradora is no different.
The background scenery is very appealing to look at thanks to smooth soft colour pallet. The charterers for both the main and supporting were aagreat looking.
As for the actual animation itself, I thought it was very good and well handled. Sure the beginning the animation is basic stuff but when we get to the actual action and emotional scenes of the series the animation really shines. The best examples of this were Taiga vs Sumire fight in episode 16 to Taiga emotional breakdown in episode 19.
Fantastic job J.C Staff
The soundtrack for Toradora is fantastic and nicely composed. I know not many people were a not fan of the soundtrack and I can understand they are coming from but I thought the soundtrack for Toradora was well made as it perfectly captures the tone and setting of Toradora perfectly. One of the song track Lost my Pieces from Toradora is not only my favourite track from Toradora but it’s also my second favourite track piece from a romance only losing to Always be With You from Kodocha.
Some of my other favourite tracks include Startup, Magic of Love, Morning Glory, Happy Monday and Ready Steady Go. They are just brilliant tracks overall.
All the opening and endings themes in Toradora are great in their own ways and they are extremely catchy.
Now for sub vs dub.
I only saw the sub twice back in 2012 but I remember it being great filled with talented Seiyuus. However, as soon as I put in DVD disc one for Toradora as well watching the first couple of episodes dubbed I immediately decided to never touch the sub again. Don’t get me wrong the sub is great but the dub was a special case of awesomeness. Out of all the romcom anime that I have seen Toradora has the best English dub that I have seen from a romcom anime. I was blown away by how awesome the dub was as every single voice actor and I mean every single one did a fantastic job voicing their respective characters. The one thing that the Toradora dub had over the sub is how realistic the acting was. Just a well-made and directed dub overall.
Toradora is a perfect example of a modern romcom anime done right. The story is well written, theme exploration is masterful, the characters are wonderful in their own ways, the visuals were nice, the soundtrack was great and the English dub was perfect.
Toradora is not only the best modern romcom anime to ever come out it’s but it’s also my third favourite romcom anime period. The show may not be for everyone but for those who adored the series such we can get past its predictable nature and flaws we see a show that is beautiful and heartwarming.
If you’re looking for a great romcom anime that has great characters and amazing themes exploration then I recommend Toradora.
It is a anime that will forerver stay in my elite four of romcom anime.",9

                First of all, if you're into Romantic Genres, you'll LOVE this, if you like School Life Themes, you'll LOVE THIS, in fact if you like anything you'll LOVE TORADORA!(Contains heavy Spoilers, not reccomended to read if you haven't watched it)
ToraDora has a very interesting story, probably the reason why I keep on watching it, I love it. Taiga loves Kitamura(which is Ryuuji's Friend) while Ryuuji loves Minorin(Taiga's friend) sound simple? as if, Both Taiga and Ryuuji really doesn't feel comfortable talking to the people they like so they decide to both help each other. That's the story in a nutshell, but what makes the story
                  so epic is how they develop their feelings for each other. The story is indeed a bit cliche however, how they develop it is interesting. The fact that they go from accomplice to lovers is what I found very outstanding. They go through life not noticing that the person they love is actually just right beside them. Indeed a very Interesting Story. I have got to say that the ending is also very fitting and I liked it very much!
I got nothing more to say to the art apart from it's decent, I liked the way they drew everyone, it's brilliant and I couldn't wish for anything more. Although to be honest with you, Ryuuji doesn't look THAT scary =), other than that, it's good.
Sound, probably the only thing I don't like about ToraDora, I don't hate it, it's just not my cup of tea. However, even if I didn't like the sound, it is very fitting, the cute atmosphere that the opening gives is good.
Characters, Aside from the storyline the characters plays a vital point in the story itself, if it wasn't for the characters it wouldn't be such a good anime. 
Ryuuji is what you would call scary, yet very admirable inside, he's easily misunderstood because of his appearance. Looks can be deceiving. He is caring and helped taiga ""survive"" everyday life by giving her comfort and food. He also want to make Taiga very happy, which is probably the reason why I liked this character. She helps her with her communication difficulties and even helped her make decisions that she would probably never done herself. She Likes Minorin, and tries very hard, however he is too shy to express his feelings.
Taiga is what you would call Tsundere - I.E. a violent human outside yet in the inside is a caring girl. She is very interesting in the fact that she can't seem to do anything right! she needs ryuuji(and was shown through the last few episodes of the anime itself) to live life. She Likes Kitamura to the point where she can barely talk to him. She also has a very special relationship with Ryuuji, the fact that he takes care of her is a special bond between Taiga and Ryuuji. She wants Ryuuji to be Happy by confessing to Minoring, however she regrets that because deep inside she likes Ryuuji, she cries and regrets. She actually Loves Ryuuji and in fact looking back at it now she loved Ryuuji from the start.
Kitamura, is also yet another interesting character, he doesn't dislike Taiga and in fact he got rejected by Taiga before. He likes the Student Council president very much that he'd actually die for her. He is very caring and doesn't want to hurt anybody. But he'd do anything for his Love, to the extreme point.
Minorin, is probably my favourite character, she is sweet, air headed but very cunning, she knows taiga the most in the series and that fact is vital to the ending of the story itself. She blows off fear by being very lively, that's one of the reason why Ryuuji liked her. She doesn't like anyone though she reveals that she liked Ryuuji in the end however she thinks that Taiga is what best for Ryuuji, she sacrificed her love for her friend, I really loved Minorin.
Ami, is a very dark and distinct character that works behind the scenes most of the time. She is afraid to show her true colours as she wants people to believe that she's actually evil inside, she has show her true colours on the main characters. She goes through her life as a model, she has a stalker, but she couldn't find the courage to stand up for herself, instead Ryuuji helped her to face her fear. She, only hinted, loves Ryuuji because of the fact that Ryuuji would like her for what she is and not for what she isn't. She is indeed an interesting character.
The Enjoyment of the show is 100% 100/10. I love it, in fact it took me less than 24 hours to actually watch the whole show, that's how much I love it. The Comedy and the Romance scene are very well put, if I was a bit more emotional I'd have cried through the series. Cry laughing and Cry sad. I would've also cried on how I wanted so much more of ToraDora, but that's how it is.
Overall a very outstanding anime. Reccomended!",10
"
                Looking to expand my occasionally action or intellectually centered anime tastes, I perused the top rated anime list in the hopes of sparking interest for something a little different. Toradora has been recommended to me a number of times over the years, but I've always been hesitant or too busy to give it a try. Perhaps it's the inconsistencies I have with the romantic comedies genre. Shows like Nodame Cantabile have left significant impressions on me, while others have been mediocre or laughable at best. Believable love stories can be difficult to convey as a narrative, especially when you start to add petty high school
                  drama and love triangles into the mix. Finish everything off with an emotional punching bag mc and exasperating tsundere and you've got the potential for failure. It took me over two months to finish Toradora for good reason. I took small breaks from it, tried to put it on hold and even considered dropping it entirely, but through sheer willpower I have reached its conclusion and wish to share why Toradora just doesn't work as a romantic anime.
I'll cut right to the chase. From its opening scene, you can tell Toradora is not trying to be your stereotypical slice of life anime. The dialogue is witty and the comedy is crass and rapidfire. Ryuji initially seemed like a refreshing protagonist in both appearance and attitude. Given his parental background, his desire to be self-sufficient is understandable. This perception quickly deteriorates as more of the characters and setting are introduced, and the infamous tsundere, Aisaka or ""Taiga"" steals the show. Now if there's one thing I've learned, it's that girls and guys have a limited number of situations in which it's believable for them to be friends. Maybe they were in diapers together or what have you but most of the time it doesn't work out without someone getting hurt or having feelings for each other. Knowing this fact you can pretty much sum up the entire plot of Toradora within the first two episodes. They're eventually going to end up together. Ryuchi and Taiga are both in love with each other's best friends, so naturally they miserably attempt to help each other pursue the affections of the other party. Every attempt to get the prospective couples alone goes awry, a great bit of foreshadowing on the writer's behalf. It sounds like a simple love story, and it really should've been. Except the countless awkward conversations and feeble advances our main characters had with their respective love interests help to cement the fact they don't deserve to be in love at their age. The ensuing 25 episodes consist of these awkward exchanges and the melodrama is so thick you could cut it with a knife. Most every interaction is misunderstood or blown out of proportion, and literally everything becomes an emotional crisis with these characters. All the while Ryuji is incessantly berated with physical and emotional abuse from Taiga. But it's OK, that just means she loves him... or something like that.
Forgive my philosophical ramblings, but I've learned through the years and relationships I've had that you can't choose who you want to fall in love with. Love just happens. It can be crude and fickle, but at the end of the day it can give you a feeling unlike anything you've felt before. This is why I don't question the validity of odd couple romances (Ore Monogatari/Nodame Cantabile etc.) throughout entertainment. Sometimes characters are polar opposites in personality and looks but something subconscious draws them together. This is what Toradora tries to accomplish. However, a relationship constructed in this manner must be done with finesse, while not being overshadowed by such melodrama as this series has. Similarly growing up in a house without a father as I have, the furthest idea from my mind would be to take care of someone with so much baggage. Taiga takes advantage of the doormat Ryuji is and carries herself in the most bombastic way possible. Ryuji is most certainly a glutton for punishment. Even if I would've enjoyed the romance elements I don't know if I could've stomached the abortion of an ending Toradora had. Many anime fail at getting love right, and this series ends up no different. All it takes is for someone to have an overly emo moment and the entire conclusion gets blown to smithereens. As the final credits were about to roll, the same tsundere stigma that was starting to fade away was slammed back into my face, taking a big shit on my hopes and expectations for the show. Those who have seen the series know exactly what I'm talking about, One of the worst endings I have seen in quite some time, a romance cop out.
Toradora's writing was frustratingly inconsistent. Character's dialogue and emotions would swap from operatic to deeply intellectual within seconds, leaving me dumbfounded as a viewer. All five main characters put on some sort of a façade with their personality, driving the story into many arguments and miscommunications. That was an aspect that I enjoyed to some extent, as I believe most everyone acts a little differently in groups of people than in a one on one interaction. The pacing is well constructed, and the series ends up being split into three major parts. The first half of the series is used mostly to set up the relationships for the five characters, but unfortunately ended up being quite boring as a result. Around episode 14 things really begin to pick up, with conflicts coming to a head as the main characters start running out of time to profess their love appropriately. Everything is assimilated effectively but falls flat due to a train wreck ending. I feel like most people who consider the ending good are only fooling themselves with false reassurance for investing so much time in the series only to be greatly disappointed. I understand that I'm probably not the target audience for this anime, but just because you're portraying a high school romantic comedy doesn't mean you have to sensationalize each line of dialogue or character's emotions. We all went to high school, but I never felt like everyone was that annoying... at least not all the time.
Although there were numerous moments of immaturity, Toradora created a setting that made me quite reminiscent of my time in high school. Embarking on school trips, creating chances to talk to that one girl you liked since grade school, or waiting for that same opportunity during a school dance or function. Although I'm frustrated by it now, hindsight is 20/20 and I could probably imagine myself being slightly timid or awkward when it came to confession time... perhaps just not on the same level as the writer portrayed here. I also love the scene with Ryuji and Minori when they were at Ami's beachhouse at night. The way they were talking about love without coming out and blatantly saying the word kind of made me laugh, and help me put back into perspective what I was watching, and how young the characters really were.
I found it irritating when the writers tried to pass off Ryuji's slanted eyes as the reason everyone thought he was rough around the edges. I know I've judged books by their covers before, but this one is just silly... not to mention the fact that most, if not all of these characters are Asian, which kind of throws that reasoning out the window. As I said before, I related to Ryuji based on personal experiences, and I was initially hoping he'd be a character I could identify with. His germaphobic nature and desire to be the patriarchal figure in his household was right on point, but I didn't buy into his relationship with Taiga one bit. The tsundere trope has always felt unnecessary to me. Even yanderes like Senjougahara from the Monogatari series has some believability, because I've encountered some crazy chicks in my lifetime... And sometimes it makes them even hotter. But it just isn't working in Taiga's case. I can give positive remarks to the amount of depth she had as a character though... and the relationship with her parents was certainly believable. I guess you never realize how pampered some kids can be until they start trying to live on their own (Taiga=primordial millennial). I just don't understand everyone's general praise for Taiga as a character, he'll she's not even the most enjoyable character from the series, let alone all of anime.
Minori actually had some depth as a character. She put on such a ditzy and carefree attitude, but in all actuality she was just as perceptive as anyone else in the series, especially when it came to Ryuji. It was refreshing to see a character playing an ""out of reach"" love interest that was everything but one-dimensional. That scene when she approached Ryuji while he was in the bear suit was kind of heartbreaking. By that point you knew the feelings she had for him were mutual, and how covered up she got them to be for Taiga's sake. Kitamura is a turd. High school taught me how vain and superficial girls can be, and if I learned anything from that, it's that no girls are attracted to the guy with glasses. Not to mention he was a complete dweeb, with spastic mannerisms that often made no sense and a complete lack of composure when he finds out his crush doesn't like him. Grow up dude, you're barely old enough to drive! It's like he almost went completely nihilistic after he bleached his hair. I kind of kept wondering how Ryuji even became friends with him, they're really nothing alike. Ami is the only character in Toradora that I actually liked to be honest. It seems that her history and modeling has actually injected a sense of maturity into her mind that the other characters just don't have. While the rest of the cast is laden with melodrama, Ami seems to come out of left field with a comment I'd expect to see in real life. Although I don't understand what she saw in Ryuji, I would've preferred if they would've ended up together vice the way that it turned out. I can only imagine how she struggled to take her friends seriously.
The music in Toradora is so-so. It didn't necessarily add or subtract much from the series... But there wasn't much variety in the use of background music. I really enjoyed the first OP and ED, but the 2nd OP really didn't flow well with the rest of the show for me... And those lyrics are ghastly. I will give props to the voice acting in Toradora, as most all of the characters were played fantastically and were very distinguishable. Most notably was Rie Kugimiya as Taiga. Her voice absolutely nailed Taiga's seething personality and tsunderisms to a tee. Yui Horie also dos a fine job as the spacey Minori. The art and animation is okay, considering the anime came out over 7 years ago I'd say it aged quite well.  As I mentioned above I was pleased by the stark differences between the five main characters, in character models especially. Some older anime have trouble differentiating the characters due to lackluster illustrators, but Toradora does not fall into that trap.
Overall, I was quite disappointed with this series. It just didn't capture the natural, unadulterated love that so many romance stories have. It even got boring with its unneeded drama and emotion-stricken scenes, leaving me to take the characters less seriously. People say that Toradora is the pinnacle of the romantic comedy genre, and if that's the case I may not be returning to it for quite some time.  I can't say I enjoyed it all that much. I'd recommend Toradora to fans of romance anime since that's the target audience, or someone who enjoys the tsundere trope... it just wasn't necessarily for me. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out my other reviews!",6

                *sigh*
You know, I’m starting to lose all hope when it comes to romance / slice of life anime as they tend to either go in a certain way: they try to be outrageously funny and/or dramatic but it ends up being only one or the other and I’m left cold feeling that have doing nothing remarkable or distinctive to make me care about the characters, what they go through and the story as a whole and if you wondered what title made me like this, let’s say that I’m all out of LOVE for this genre. But, then, there’s Toradora and I have heard mixed
                  things about the series (few either good than bad) but I don’t have the biggest expectations for the show.
Despite Ryuji Takasu’s gentle personality, his eyes make him look like an intimidating delinquent. Class rearrangements on his second high school year put him together with his best friend, Yusaku Kitamura, and his hidden crush, Minori Kushieda. Along with these two comes Kushieda’s best friend, Taiga Aisaka. Her delicate appearance contrasts with her brutal personality. Secretly in love with Kitamura, Taiga agrees to help Ryuji with his love interest as long as he helps her get closer to hers.
Now, as first it may seem like this is going to be some typical love story where the main guy tries to get with this girl by the help of the girl’s said friend and that said friend wants to hook up with the main guy’s best friend and then it turns out that those two might fall in love with each other. BUT…..it actually ends up being more than that. The show illustrates that love is a complicated thing and if something comes crumbling down, no one is going to be left unscathed emotionally, no matter how well you try to hide it. Originally, I was drawn by the comedic aspects of the show as I did had myself a great laugh throughout the earlier episodes but once it gets into the dramatic episodes later on, I was hooked and invested in knowing how the characters will progress throughout. One aspect of the show never overshadowed the other as both the comedy and drama are rightfully balanced without a hint of overexerted awkwardness in the writing.
I really appreciated how the characters in the show remain to be interesting and likable despite being some clichéd character-types at first but they are portrayed as realistic characters and the show equally get in-depth with them as the show goes on. At first, I thought Taiga was just going that annoying tsundere type that I loathe in anime so much, but eventually, she turns out to be an endearing character and reasons why she is what she is (i.e. coming from a broken home, parents don’t give a damn) and how she does stand up for her friends various times and is straight to the point honest. Ryuuji is somebody that isn’t a spineless male lead nor an off-the-wall perverted idiot lead, but a level-headed genuine character that doesn’t come off as Gary Stu-ish or manufactured as he does have his inner struggles to challenge through. Yusaku, to me, can be often funny and OK but he wasn’t really that important of a character to me to get fully invested but he does have a moment in that in the latter half of the series. But the ones to get me fully invested are Minori and Ami. For Minori, she does seems like the energetic best friend character with a nice girl personality that I really did like at first but she really progresses from that as she show signs of her not confronting her true feelings that she seems like a coward even though she does care for her friends. Ami on the other hand, I never would have expect to like someone as her being a bitch-in-sheep’s clothing character but honestly she wants more in friends than just having followers and admirers and while often she does pick on Taiga, she does care if anything were to happen to her.
J.C. Staff animated this production and it was a great effort from their part. However, this is nothing I would call new but more of the standard fare I expect from them as the artwork is gorgeous and the movement is performed smoothly and fluid within the context of the show. Character designs are also much to the standard of many anime characters but it is nothing over-the-top or fan service related but manageable.
For the music portion, “Pre-Parade”, the 1st opening theme performed by the main three female leads (Rie Kugimiya, Yui Horie, and Eri Kitamura) does set the mood for the series’ first half and I got to say, this is a decent track with some small flaws in it like it does sound like it’s over-produced in some areas but I actually like the track enough to not skip it. The 2nd opening theme, “silky heart”, also appropriately set the tone during the latter half of the series remarkably acceptable. The rest of the music delivers the dramatic moments spot-on as did the ending themes, “Vanilla Salt” and “Orange”, which sounds like ingredients for a cake than a song.
Now when I say this show was a surprise to me being good, there is also another surprise.
THIS SHOW ACTUALLY HAS AN ENGLISH DUB!!!!
No, really. This show is licensed by NIS America and normally they do sub-only anime releases and this is their first English dub release and also with the dub being done by Bang Zoom Entertainment and with director Alex Von David on the helm. I’m also proud to say that this is a damn good—no, a damn great dub!! Mainly, it’s because BZ is doing a slice-of-life show for once since recently they have only been dubbing action anime titles for some time and I think the dub shows off the VA’s acting range a bit more. Erik Scott Kimerer and Cassandra Lee Morris give out great performances as Ryuuji and Taiga. Johnny Yong Bosch was rather fine as Yusaka, usually the standard from him but he did his part exceptionally. Personally I think the standouts goes to both Christine Marie Cabanos as Minori and Erika Harlacher as Ami. Cabanos unquestionably delivers more to her acting range as Minori during the dramatic moments as well as her comedic scenes. Most of her comedic scenes did felt like a preview of what to see her as Mako in Kill La Kill (which I’m dying to see in the English dub, BTW). Harlacher sounds very natural as Ami, maintaining both the bitchiness and reasonableness in the character without feeling too overbearing or over the top and this is practically the actress’ best role yet.
FINAL VERDICT: Toradora is a complete surprise from me. Here I was expecting to be some run of the mill cliché romance anime but I got something more from this. Everything from the characters, the basic storyline and the soundtrack was executed well despite being plain on paper. Has this made me look at slice of life romantic anime in a different light? Maybe. This show gave me hope for this genre of anime and I hope future titles can learn from this show and how to make me care for the story, the characters and how they’re able to manage that. Toradora, you are definitely a title that I recommend to people. I should’ve never doubted you.",9
"
                Toradora! is one of those animes that immediately pop into my mind when someone asks me for a rom/com recommendation. It's simply a must-watch if you're a fan of rom/com. Even if you aren't a typical watcher of these kinds of shows, Toradora! is definitely a great first step into that world. 
STORY:
Toradora! follows a typical plot: a guy named Takasu Ryuuji has a crush on a girl, who just happens to be his neighbor's best friend. Coincidentally, the neighbor, Aisaka Taiga, has a crush on Takasu's best friend, Yuusaka Kitamura. The two team up and try to help each other get their targets through
                  their adventures. But as the story introduces more characters and progresses from its light-hearted comedy to its heavy drama, the story evolves from its cliche'd plot and takes on a much deeper story. And while many animes are able to conduct such a transition, Toradora! is one that is able to do so subtly and beautifully. 
10/10.
ART:
I'm not particularly picky about the art for animes, and to be completely honest, there's nothing special about the art for Toradora!. But it's definitely visually appealing and is well done. The only issue I had was he striking similarity between Kawashima Ami and the Student Countil President. The two were so similar I constantly confused one for the other when they were both introduced. Other than that, I thought the art was great. 
9/10.
SOUND:
When an anime has a great OP, I never skip it for each episode. Unfortunately, that didn't happen with Toradora!. While the first OP was quite catchy when I first heard it, it soon became something I just skipped to get to the show. Generally, the music was nothing special, especially during the light-hearted scenes. But the more touching moments of the anime had wonderful music that practically drove me to tears. Many dramatic scenes with crying characters or fights sent shivers done my spine as my vision started to blur in front of the screen. Such music was simply nicely fit into such moments and I couldn't describe it any other way. 
10/10.
CHARACTER:
The characters at first appear to be two dimensional. But they have a lot more to them later when the story really hits the dramatic point. At that point, a lot of the characters' different sides and hidden desires are revealed and each changing angle is so interesting. I can't go into too much detail without spoiling the story, so unfortunately I cannot substantiate my view. The characters are all lovable with their quirks and moments, especially Aisaka Taiga. She was by far my favorite character throughout the whole anime. 
9/10.
ENJOYMENT:
With the unique execution and traversal of such an cliche'd story, I was well caught off-guard with such a emotional ride. The music and the story just blended together to create something that was truly amazing. I cried plenty and was hungry for more after I finished the series. It got so bad that afterwards, I went into a state of depression because I couldn't find anything like Toradora! 
Toradora! definitely remains as one of the animes at the top of my list.",10
"
                Toradora is one of the first animes that left me questioning whether I enjoyed the ride or not... In my opinion, I feel like the progression of the story and the way the characters are conflict in so many ways.
Starting in order of importance:
Story - It was very spot-on and unique. A story about a boy meeting a girl for the purpose of giving each other relationship advice is not the conventional anime. It does not go direct with the romance. Rather, it takes its time to establish the characters and their relations amongst each other. The pacing of the story was also great, each
                  episode you learn something new. However, the reason I gave it an 8 was the ending. One thing I REALLY hate about this anime is how whenever a character talks to the main character of how they truly feel, the main character ends up not listening and the whole conversation just drops like a rock. This recurrent element made it difficult for me to get to know the characters. They, most of the time, introduce their problems and almost never finish off with how it ties to the story, The ending was 
(SPOILER ALERT) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
also super rushed and it felt as if all their efforts from the very beginning had gone to waste. The ending was a big middle finger to all of the other characters within the last few episodes. They get cast out and the unfinished links with the main character remain unlinked.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Character - The characters are very realistic. Every character puts on a mask in their own way. There is a large barrier between how the characters act and how they truly feel. 
One big complaint I have, however, is that each character is frustrating to the plot in its own way. There are random potential scenes that could lead to something moving the plot, but in the end you learn almost nothing of the characters from that scene. The only time we get to truly know the characters is AFTER you go through all the frustration of the progression of the story.
Art - The art makes this anime. Each character is distinct in their own way and the colors they use is awesome.
Sound - It moves with the story well, especially the opening. Very beautiful and well-timed.
Enjoyment - The comedic scenes were really enjoyable and some really dramatic scenes hit me hard. Although this anime failed to meet a resolution, it does make unforgettable climaxes that occur amongst each character. In short, when shit gets down, it GETS DOWN. 
TOO LONG DIDN'T READ?:
Story is realistic and complex. However, when you think something important to the story is going to happen, it won't happen. Each character is lovable and different in their own way. Art and Sound is beautiful. Very enjoyable, you will get hooked. When shit gets down, IT GETS DOWN.",7
"
                Alright, let's get this over with.
I am going to preface this ""review"" (probably little more than a trite rant because I can't review worth a damn) by saying that I'm sure you have your reasons for liking Toradora, you know, that's totally fine. I'm not the be all and end all.
But to be blunt, I don't just dislike this show. I despise it and everything it stands for.
Let's see: Toradora is supposed to be a rom-com-drom, right? So, how does each category stand?
1. Romance
The romance is bad. Plain and simple. The connections between Taiga and Ryuuji are barely prevalent throughout the course of the show,
                  barring like maybe the last few episodes, and even then it didn't give me any kind of emotions at all.
There's rushing your romance, and then there's dragging on for so long you almost forget who's supposed to be with who.
But hey, I could be interpreting it wrong.
2. Comedy
Comedy is subjective, right? Well, in my subjective opinion, this show is dull as fuck when it comes to comedy. Not much to elaborate on here, besides the fact I don't find this show funny.
3. Drama
Well, with the dull romance and comedy, we're left with drama.
And well, this show does have drama. Melodrama. And this is where my true hatred for this show comes into play.
I'm not kidding when I say the characters COMPLETELY overreact over the smallest fucking things in this show. 
For instance, your crush gets rejected by his own crush?
Go fucking MURDER her with a wooden sword! Because that's not over reacting!
Your father sometimes neglects you?
FUCKING DESTROY his testicles when you finally see him!
You didn't give someone a box of chocolates?
Well, overreact over that too, because we don't have enough melodrama in this show!
The last example isn't a joke by the way. That's literally one of the scenes.
Honestly, this show tries to be dramatic just for the purpose of shoehorning in drama. It's almost obnoxious to be honest.
And to go over the characters briefly:
Ryuuji is forgettable.
Taiga is the worst tsundere ever.
Kitamura is forgettable.
Ami exists solely to spew meaningless meaningful words.
And Minori is bi, apparently.
If it wasn't obvious enough, I don't care about anyone in this show.
________________________________________________________
Overall, it's very likely I'm interpreting all of the messages that Toradora gives wrong, and for that reason, I suppose I can see why people actually go as far to say that this is their favourite show.
But according to my interpretation, Toradora is nothing more than a painfully unfunny, melodramatic failure of a romance.
At least the music and animation is good.
Kudos to whoever actually read my god-awful ""review"".",3
"
                Haven't had a chance to watch a lot of the fall schedule's anime, but this is becoming one of my personal favorites. Taiga starts out as one of the most obnoxious schoolgirls you'll ever meet. and Ryuuji is one of those misunderstood guys that can't seem to catch a break from his classmates. but the repartee between him and Taiga is priceless.  The artwork could be a little sharper, but this is J.C. Staff, so i'll cut them a little slack. and the ED is a little bit of an earworm. but hey, i like a good song that sticks in yr. earhole.
and the
                  supporting cast so far is very funny, espec. Minorin. she'd be a a good blonde.
Overall, this is one of the funnier shows i've seen this fall.",7
"
                Why is it that we choose to watch a show rather than just read a synopsis of what happens during it? It's because the value of a show comes from more than just how it sounds when you summarize it: it comes from experiencing it, getting invested in a world other than the one you live in. It comes from the little things.
Toradora is all about the little things.
This is an instance where I feel the MAL system of evaluation breaks down: story, art, sound, character, enjoyment: what does it matter what each of these may be individually when you're never going to experience them
                  individually? Yes, Toradora's premise isn't all that unique, nor does it deconstruct it or make any particularly unexpected decisions. Yes, the art is solid but not mind-blowing. But the difference between the 1970s animated Lord of the Rings movies and Peter Jackson's epic masterpieces isn't any of that: they're both telling the exact same story. It lies in the execution, the actual process of telling it. I would liken Toradora to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings in that both of them are a story that we've all seen before, and both of them nevertheless stand apart and above for doing it better, far FAR better, then anything that came before or after them. When you're watching an anime, all that you're ever going to experience is the ""overall"", and so that's the kind of review that I'm writing for Toradora. It's an ""overall"" review. 
Toradora follows the story of Ryuji Takasu and his high-school adventures with his group of friends, with the main five characters being Taiga, the short, feisty delinquent; Minori, the peppy go-getter; Ami, the vain yet self-conscious model; Kitamura, the upstanding cool-and-collected member of the student council; and Ryuji himself. From the beginning all five of these characters possess an enchanting depth and color, immediately defying the archetypes that we assume them to be. They converse like actual people, with captivating often irrelevant dialogue that is nevertheless extremely enjoyable. It's actually a pretty funny show (believe it or not, given the track record anime has with comedy), with what I found to be some solid laugh-out-loud moments that help to carry it along very nicely.
The character Ryuji initially grows closest with is Taiga Aisaka, and let me just say that I was absolutely blown away by her character. I've heard it said that Taiga is nothing more than a traditional Tsundere, and I would have to entirely disagree. I would find it hard to even classify her as a Tsundere, or someone who expresses their affection through coldness or aggression. At the beginning of the series it is revealed that Taiga has a crush on Kitamura, and throughout the entirety of the series she is outwardly caring, polite and forthright with him. There's nothing remotely Tsundere about it. This assumption instead spawns from the way that Taiga interacts with most of the other people in her life: she is blunt and easily angered. This stems not from some contrived shyness but rather from a fundamental fear of being rejected by the people she opens up to, a desire to be compassionate that has been buried by personal experience. Taiga's issues are much more deep-seated and pathological, and whilst at the beginning of the series I initially found her to be annoying and vicious, by the end she had essentially taught me to look at people in a different light. You DON'T know someone else just through a couple of interactions, and you don't know an anime character just because you've watched four episodes of their show. The idea behind Taiga's character is perhaps nothing new, but the WAY in which Toradora handles it is: it's compelling, believable and eye-opening. 
Taiga's not the only character the show manages to execute with divine grace: the two other girls, Ami Kawashima and Minori Kushieda (a name that has been forever etched upon my mind) add their own gleam to the outstanding cast. I don't want to go nearly as much into what makes them amazing for spoiler reasons, but I will say this: Minori Kushieda is without a doubt one of my favorite characters of all time. Ryuji himself is a very solid male lead: we've all seen the dark-haired young male protagonist through which the story is told, but Ryuji definitely lends it a new flair with his own tragically fitting yet often hysterical eccentricities involving cooking and cleaning, and his subtly masochistic nature. He also hits a perfect balance between being able to handle situations in a mature manner and not being turned into a Gary-Stu like SAO's Kirito. He's an intelligent boy who knows what he wants and isn't afraid to voice his opinions, but he can get hot-blooded or embarrassed and loses much of his functionality around his crush.
Speaking of crushes, do you like romance? Because that's where Toradora really tips the balance from ""amazing character study"" to ""one of the all-time best"" for me. 
Toradora: a romance like no other. Not because of some bold decision it makes, just because of the Toradora way: taking what has already been done and doing it that much better. I have said before that Toradora gets what love is, and I stand by that. It doesn't romanticize it or glorify it, it shows it for what it is: messy, confusing, difficult and beautiful. It has a grasp on real chemistry, and its romance feels as though it springs not from the creator's decisions but from the decisions that the actual characters would make. Feelings are not eternal: they change a bit with each new day, and what we experience can either reinforce or alter them. People are not ""meant"" for each other, and relationships are not founded on the simple joy of mutual affection: they take work, patience, experience, and time to mature. All of this is and always will be part of love, and its what makes it a wonderful, complex thing. Perfection is woven from the strands of imperfection, and that's what makes love such a perfect thing.
Overall? Overall I give Toradora a ""watch it"". It's one of the greatest things I've ever seen, and it's definitely my favorite romance. If you're seeking plot or action, take a pass on this one. It's simply not for you. But if when you hear ""outstanding characters"" or ""high-school rom-com done right"" your ears perk up and your heart beats a little faster, then open up watchcartoononline.com or whatever site you may use and start on episode 1. Enjoy!
*Note: Despite the controversy I'm sure this will cause, I recommend the dub over the sub. I've watched the series all the way through twice, one in each, and I thought that the dub was stellar and gave the character's voices more individuality. However, this is widely chalked up to personal preference so I wouldn't put too much weight on it.",9
"
                [Adapted From Original Blog Post]
I'm sure you've heard this expression before: ""don't judge a book by its cover"" It's a very simple phrase, the meaning being that you can't judge something by what it appears to be, and it's a phrase that you hear repeated, over and over again, no matter where you go in your life. However, despite this, I think you'd be surprised by just how often we judge things superficially, whether it be anime, movies, situations, and most of all: people, way, way, too often. I bring up this for two reasons. This relates to the review because when you first see
                  Toradora and read the description of the show, it's all too easy to completely dismiss, because on the outside, Toradora looks like every other boring slice-of-life/school romance anime that has ever been created, with a bland protagonist, nerdy best friend, and tsundere love interest all wrapped in a high-school setting that has at this point past the point of ""done to death"" and reached the point of ""this is really getting old, please stop"". But while on the outside Toradora may look incredibly bland and passionless, the product of the dangling flesh off of the actually interesting-looking shows of the season, included only to fill the space, it's actually possibly one of the most competent anime I've ever seen at exactly what it does and accomplishes by the end of its run. The second reason is while Toradora is undoubtedly a story about a misunderstood teenager named Ryuugi and a fierce girl named Aisaka Taiga discovering for themselves exactly what this thing called love actually is, it is also, somewhat, about ""judging a book by its cover"". About the dangers of stereotyping the people around you. About those personas we put on during our every day lives, when we're with acquaintances, friends, or even family. About those hidden emotions and desires that we never tell the world or can't admit to ourselves, that will eventually, inevitably, make themselves visible for all to see. And why that's okay.
     Hello people of ""The Wired"", my name is Quan, I hope you've had a great day thus far, and welcome, one and all, to anime review 15#. Today we take a look at the heavily acclaimed slice-of-life-romance anime: Toradora(exclamation mark technically, but seriously, that will just mess me up so screw it), and maybe along the way, find out for sure who ""best girl"" really is. Now then, let's begin.
Toradora was brought to us by the animation studio J.C Staff, a studio that I""m quite fond of, even if few seem to share my view point. They've brought us nice little shows over the years, all three seasons of Shakugan no Shana, Selector Infected WIXOSS, Ano Natsu de Matteru, A Certain Scientific Railgun and its sequel A Certain Scientific Railgun S. If you were to put me on the spot, I'd perhaps say that Toradora remains their strongest work(though arguably WIXOSS and Railgun S are better), which sort of shows that they typically don't produce particularly exceptional anime much of the time. That's why it's surprising, I guess, to see an anime like Toradora come from them.
      The director was Tatsuyuki Nagai, who you may recognize, and for good reason, since he is a quite exceptional director. He's brought us works such as Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day, Ano Natsu de Matteru and A Certain Scientific Railgun, which sort of makes it odd that he directed something as mature as this anime. It was written by Mari Okada of WIXOSS, Anohana, Nagi no Asukara and Gosick fame, and the series aired between October 2, 2008 and March 26, 2009. Into the plot. 
Ryuuji Takasu is ready for the best year of high-school he has ever had. Till this point, he had been shunned by classmates for his fierce looks and eyes that seem to glare at whoever he looks at, so he has had trouble making friends and convincing the teachers he doesn't want to beat them up. However, this year, not only is he in the same class as his best friend: Yuusaku Kitamura, but also the girl he has had an borderline-obsessive crush on for the last few years on: the optimistic and cheerful Minori Kushieda, but since Ryuuji has absolutely no intentions of confessing his feelings, well ever, he is content to watch on without doing anything. The second thing to happen on his first day of school is that he meets Aisaka Taiga(and by meets I mean she punches him in the jaw and walks off). Taiga has earned the nickname ""Palm-Top Tiger"" throughout the school, because while she is so short that it's easy to mistake her for a small child, she has a violent and aggressive personality and will take absolutely nothing from anybody.
After this meeting, it would seem like the two would like nothing more to do with each-other, however, various circumstances draw the two together again, as Ryuuji accidentally discovers Taiga's love letter to Kitamura. After calming her down enough so she won't impale him with her sword, Ryuuji strikes a deal with Taiga: he'll help her confess to Kitamura properly, as long as Taiga helps him get closer to her best friend: Minori Kushieda. I'm sure you can see where this is going. So, as the two agree to help each-other with their own romantic endeavors, they not only begin to discover the true nature of their respective crushes, but also each-other, as Taigi learns that Ryuuji is not in fact a no-good delinquent as much as actually a really nice guy, and Ryuuji learns that there is far more to the Palm-Top Tiger, his group of friends, and the very nature of love, than he could possibly imagined. This sets the stage for one of the, in my opinion, absolute best slice-of-life/romance/drama anime of the last decade, that along the way turns from exactly what you expect to something you never saw coming, and by the end, has more profound things to say about love, relationships and people than any romance Hollywood or other mediums have produced for the last few years. An anime not without flaws, but deserves all the praise I'm about to give it.
The first thing you need to admit about the nature of Toradora is that it is built primarily on a foundation of cliches and archetypes. This is not an original plot, many have done this story before and many more will do so in the future, and, at least at first, all the characters are cliches you've seen a million time before. Ryuuji is ""the nice guy"", Taigi is such a tsundere that she has pretty much become a poster-child for the archetype in the last few years(along such ""deres"" as Asuka from Evangelion, Senjougahara Hitagi from Bakemonogatari and Shana from Shakugan no Shana), and all the other characters fit into archetypes such as: ""the guy with glasses"", ""the ball-of-energy"", and ""the manipulative bitch"". Locations are pretty typical as well, because when it isn't school it just has to be a festival, or a beach, or pick whatever cliche you want out of a hat. However, what you really need to give Toradora credit for is how it handles these familiarities of the genre, instead of letting everything play out in a typical way, it actually takes these archetypes and crafts and develops them, investigating the ever-changing character dynamics and relationships and uses them to hammer home its thematic point, which is not easy to do no matter what genre you are talking about: to deliver a firm message without sacrificing characters or exposition to make sure you get your point across.
It just takes a little while to get there is all. You will undoubtedly watch the first half of Toradora with a judging look on your face, because it's really nothing that special. Sure, a few moments split up the mediocrity in that time frame, but the first half of Toradora is hardly anything you've never seen before in a million other slice-of-lives. It's not bad by any means, after all, the show has a good sense for comedy and cuteness(particularly in Taiga's case), and the characters are enduring if one-dimensional, but no doubt you might be wondering what all the fuss is about for these span of episodes. It wasn't till much later on, at the end of the school festival arc that I was really sold on the show, and that's a whole 13 episodes in... which you know, is more than half the show, so that's a huge problem really. What I want you to take out of this section however, is not to let your expectations drop this show in the first half, because that will ultimately let down the experience of the whole show. Instead, appreciate a little the build-up and moving character pieces in this first half, because undoubtedly, this first half is a very well orchestrated, very meticulous set-up of the story contextual and thematically. How about I put it like this? If you took the first half of the show and cut it entirely, the show would fall apart at the seems, because what the first half is most definitely not is filler, and for that, I'm grateful. And hey, it's still not terrible, so if you like these kind of shows you should be more than entertained for this first half.
     But yes, I've built it up enough, so I'll admit it: the second half is where the anime really comes alive for me. Suddenly it isn't watching stereotypes amble through a non-existent plot, it's watching characters grow and change as their emotions and desires push forward the plot to an inevitable and emotional conclusion, making the last 5 or so episodes of show tense and satisfying as all these relationships that the anime had built up in that first half play out and collide, and it's satisfying as hell. That's one thing I really give Toradora credit for: it has an ending, and not just an ending, but a perfectly concise and complete ending, that leaves no room for a satisfying sequel or anything like that, and that's something I think is a little under-appreciated: an ending. Mostly how these slice-of-life play out is that they end inconclusively; relationships still developing so they never actually go anywhere, and plot-lines unfinished because there wasn't enough source material or whatever. This completeness is what puts Toradora above other anime of the genre, it just doesn't hint at relationships between characters and leave the two in a sort of ""shipping limbo"", it fully explores each and every one, giving each plot-line a conclusion, as well as each character. And after 25 episodes of watching these characters, you are completely and totally satisfied with what you have seen, and me personally, didn't want to see anymore. That's rare, especially for an anime, where you are lucky if your favorite show even gets a third season after leaving the story at a crappy cliffhanger(yes, I'm looking at you Spice and Wolf(and yes, I'm still bitter)). Some may not like the ending because it wasn't quite what they were looking expecting, but I thought it was great, and rather sweet as well.
     I guess the biggest problem with Toradora as a whole is that it holds back itself by simply being what it is, and yes I intend to explain that further. What I mean is that while Toradora takes what it has and develops it wonderfully, it still doesn't manage to break free of the shackles of the stereotypes and archetypes it has surrounded itself with. It's still an ""anime rom-com"" at heart, which means for all the great drama there is plenty of melodramatic moments, for all the great dialouge there is a couple exchanges that will no doubt make you groan, and hell, there's even a little fan-service along for the ride(though it's thankfully very, very scarce). Now, I'm not trying to say you can't craft an amazing story out of a very familiar premise. For example, the manga Stealth Symphony managde to take the typical shounen formula, setting, and protagonist and practically transforms every aspect of it into something unique and entertaining by the end, practically deconstructing its entire world, but despite this, it still is true to what it is, never feeling like a satire or a genre deconstruction. So yes, despite the archetypes and despite the setting, I think Toradora still could have been able to craft them into something that was so good that the familiar formula did not matter. I just don't think it quite gets there. Which is a shame, but nowhere near a deal-breaker.
A common criticism I've seen of Toradora is that it's predictable: that it isn't hard at all to determine who is going to end up with who by the end of the series, and I've got a couple of mixed feelings about this problem. First yes, you can pretty much see where the entire series is going from the second episode, not all the great twists or development or emotional scenes, but you'll probably get an idea of the final placement of things. On the other hand though, the anime doesn't really have any intentions of trying to conceal the end placement of the relationships of the characters, in fact, you could argue that it spoils the ending in the very first episode, and it does this because the anime has a point to make and a moral to teach, and regards anything that would stimulate contextual tension, well, I wouldn't say irrelevant, but rather less important than the message. That's great and all, and I appreciate that Toradora never really backs down from that stance and tries to make unnecessary drama, but at the same time, tension and uncertainty are very important tools in keeping your audience engaged with your story, and without either for the most biggest question of the entire show... is a questionable decision, at least in my opinion. I recognize that this won't be as much as a problem for some people, or others might not pick up on the message so it won't matter, but still, I felt I needed to address that before I moved on. Now, let's talk about characters.
So for characters, I'm going to do something a little different. There's five main characters of this show that you need to remember, and I'm going to tackle them out of order for the most part, just so I can save what I really want to talk about for last. But first, our main character: Ryuugi, how does he hold up as a character? Well, I'm sorry to say, not great. Despite other archetypes in the show getting development to justify their behavior, Ryuuji very much stays in the role of ""the nice guy"" for the entirety of the show, and he doesn't exactly have any interesting conflict or drama, he just mostly tries to do what he thinks is best for everyone. What I do want to talk about, and what I consider the only really interesting part to his character is how the show turns those good intentions against him, particularly at the end of a certain arc, where it's brought into question whether Ryuuji tries to help people without truly knowing how to fix their problems, and ends up making the situation worse. It's a rather cool idea, but sadly it doesn't get brought up too much, so ultimately,while he isn't a bad character, sadly our lead looks rather flat compared to the rest of the cast.
     Minori is the target of Ryuuji's affections, his crush throughout the show, and who he seeks to get closer to for its entire duration. She is a cheerful, optimistic girl who, in the words of Ryuuji ""is as radient as the sun"", who looks to spread merriment wherever she may be, which allows her to deal with Taiga's quirks or whoever else she might be dealing with, like a character I'll be talking about in a little bit. However, this personality cloaks a girl with serious issues when it comes to how she views other people and herself, a cloak that the anime spends plenty of time slowly stripping away to show the rather depressed girl inside. Now, I recognize that Minori's character as a concept is nothing exactly new, but you rarely see this kind of character as well developed t as she is, and not in terms of huge revelations, but rather that the anime provides a very clear reason for every action she takes in the anime, even if those reasons are sometimes buried under layers of subtly or metaphor. And on a personal note, her character's resolution in the last episodes is by far my favorite in the entire show; just see for yourself, it's just awesome.
     I think Kitamura's character was sort of pushed to the side to make room for the development of the other characters. He's by far the worst and least focused on character of the anime, only getting a single arc to himself, which means that all his development needed to happen in that single arc, which means that said development is rushed and not very well handled. In his role as Taiga's crush, Kitamura sort of plays the role of the down-to-earth character, one of the only ones who recognizes all the barriers that his friends have put around themselves and allows him to see people for how they truly are, which is why he makes friends with Ryuuji despite the rest of the class being scared away by his looks and eyes. But there's also a slight problem in there, because while the anime tells us that Kitamura and Ryuuji are best friends they rarely act like it, Kitamura almost being in the role of the ""knowledgeable-onlooker"" for the whole show. Rather stale as a character really.
Ami is best girl, and if you disagree, we can chose a time and place to fight later, for now, I want to defend my answer. By ""best girl"", I don't mean Amy was the one I was rooting to end up together with Ryugi at the end of the anime(I was more or less on Team Palm-Top Tiger for the whole time), but what I mean that Ami is probably the most interesting character in the entire show, so let me explain why. Introduced in episode 5, Ami is a child-hood friend of Kitamura, who due to her stunning beauty, works as a model and spends time outside of school of the first four episodes of the anime. However, her sweet and dainty personality is nothing but an act she puts on for her classmates and acquaintances, hiding a cold and manipulative girl who views herself above others and is not afraid to verbally abuse anybody she doesn't like. That of course, until she meets her match in Taigi, Ryuuji and Minori. I say that she's the best character because she's the one who most illustrates the message of the show while still being to go through her own well-paced arc, trying to earn the admiration of classmates by changing her personality, but she's ultimately a tragic character, because she can't earn the admiration and love of the people she actually respects because they see her not as the perfect model that she projects, but rather a normal girl. She's also the one to voice of one of Toradora's most interesting themes, that is ""love vs admiration"", which I won't spoil for you, because I want it to be something you think about for yourself when the anime raises it, but I think it also speaks volumes for her character and development.
    And now it's finally time to talk about the main heroine of the anime, the Palm-Top Tiger: Aisaka Taiga, and I must say, I love this girl; she's one of the most enduring characters I've come across in anime. Taigi is a tsundere beyond a doubt, but like Minori, the show takes the archetype to its full potential, going into detail of what circumstances would drive a person to adapt a ""tsundere"" personality, and this of course leads her to being the second-best character in the anime, only second to Ami. However beneath her hot-headed surface personality, Taiga is revealed to be a somewhat clumsy and quirky girl, unable to control her own emotions which leads to her making bad decisions, which is why having a best friend like Minori(and of course Ryuugi) to control her, is so good for Taiga, as they are able to look past her pride and sarcasm to help the well-meaning girl underneath. And while her tsundere personality traits get a little tiring in the first half of the anime on occasion, she does somewhat ""drop the act"" in the second half, as you discover the true reasons behind her personality. I know she's the main focus of the show for all intensive purposes, and with that should come perks for her character, but she's well handled as a character no matter how you look at it, a tiny, fierce, sweet, strong, prideful tiger that at the end of the day, just wants the best for the people she cares about... plus, she's kind of adorable as well, if we're being honest.
As we move into animation, I'm sorry to say that J.C Staff won't exactly impress anybody with their work here. Their studio has never been particularly the ""crisp-of-the-cream"" in terms of animation(in fact I think the only time they impressed me with their animation quality was in Railgun S), but still, considering how good this show actually is, I would have liked to see some extra effort put in. Colors and backgrounds are extremely bland, making the anime miss some vibrancy and life in certain scenes, plus, character designs are pretty standard as well(beside Taigi, strangely). It very standard looking, which is why I appreciate even more how the production value seemed to go up as the anime continued. Now, admittedly, this just might be me hallucinating, but I swear everything in general looker better in the second half of the anime, particularly the last few episodes. What I can confirm is that the animation production will increase exponentially during scenes of great importance in the latter stages of the show, and they do look very nice, giving even more power to scenes that are emotional and well-written on their own, so thank you for at least that J.C Staff. Overall though, it's nothing too special. 
The same goes for the OST. Thought the music was done by Yukari Hashimoto, who has done some actually rather brilliant OSTs such as Mawaru Penguindrum and Yuri Kuma Arashi, Toradora's is rather standard, plenty of cheerful slice of life jingles and calm piano pieces inter-cut with various instruments. It's not all bad I guess, and some tracks such as ""Kaze no Kiite"" and ""Psychocandy"" are rather catchy and upbeat, which do well for background music, if nothing else. However, there is one song within this OST that I can safely categorize as brilliant, and that is the song ""Lost My Pieces"", a truly haunting yet beautiful song ripe with emotion, that plays during one of the biggest emotional high points of the show, and damn is it effective. As for openings, I know a lot of people prefer the admittedly catchy first OP: ""Pre-Parade"", but I find it a little annoying to be honest, and much prefer the second opening ""Silky Heart"".
It took me awhile to actually figure out how much I liked Toradora. As much praise as I've been giving it, it was always in the back of my mind that this was at its core just another slice-of-life/romance, but at the same time, I was wondering how much I could actually penalize the anime for that. However, through writing this review and taking a look back at the show a few months after I initially finished it, I've come to the conclusion that I sort of love this anime. Yes, it's cliche or maybe even melodramatic at poinst, and yes, some characters are sacrificed for others, particularly the supporting cast, and hell, even if I don't, I know a lot of people hate the ending. But for me, Toradora at the end of the day is absolute proof that an anime can be more than the sum of its parts, that it can take all of these things and situations we've seen so, so many other times, and turn them into probably one of the best slice-of-life/romance anime we will ever see. And yeah, I know that's a big statement, but after looking at the thematic under-pinning, and the characters, and how well built up almost everything in the anime actually is, I find that Toradora makes it onto the list of anime that I can completely recommend no matter who you are, because it truly has something for everyone, and it truly has a profound point to make that we all can and should take to heart and apply to our lives. And hell, there's not a lot of pieces of entertainment in mediums that can say that. So yes, the Palm-Top Tiger has won me over at the end, and I'm thoroughly pleased to be counted as one of the people who love this anime.
Final Verdict: 8/10

"
                Story: Not much to say for a storyline in Toradora, it seems pretty much to be a series of conflicts, one following the other. However, I'm not saying that the conflicts aren't interesting, but for people who like one strong storyline, this series is not for you.
Art: One of the strong points of Toradora. The artwork I must say, sorry IamJoe, is &quot;fabulous&quot; ^^. The artwork is fluid and clean. The pictures have strong colors that catch the eye, and keep your attention. Shading, light, etc, are all well composed throughout the anime. Each scene, disregarding events, are highly detailed, and only compliments and enhcances
                  the anime.
Sound: The music in the OP and ED, though not my style, succeed in conveying the events in the anime, which is actually quite rare in anime. In addition to actually matching the story, the music is catchy. I often find myself in school or at home bored, and before realizing it, I am singing &quot;Banira, salturade, banira.&quot; Quite embarrassing when everybody in class turns around and stares at me. &lt;&lt;
But yeah, good music.
Characters: Another strong point in Toradora, the characters all have strong personalities, and are generably likable. The characters go through life changing events that do change them forever, giving the anime a sense of realism. The characters all have unique designs that support their personalities, and make the series that much better.
Enjoyment: Toradora is mostly enjoyable. Now, notice I say &quot;mostly&quot;. There are a considerable number of dull points that made me want to stop watching the series, for me, mostly in the beginning. However, if you give the anime a chance, after a few episodes, the anime will grow on you, and you will come to like it.
Overall: Good",7
"
                I began Toradora thinking it was going to be just another romantic comedy. I had read various reviews, not expecting much from this anime at all, and so allow me to start of my review by saying: Toradora is phenomenal, stupefying, heart-stirring and just plain amazing. It exceeded all my expectations BY FAR and will surely leave a huge impact on rest of my life. After I finished the series, I was lost for words. I literally just sat there staring at my computer screen still astonished at what I have just completed.
The story of Toradora is unique and realistic. This is not your typical
                  romantic comedy; it will leave MUCH more of an impact on you. The anime includes various twists and turns that left me pretty much speechless. There are times when you will be laughing your head off and there will be times when it feels like someone stabbed your heart, so when you get that lump in your throat, don't be surprised! What I love about Toradora is its overall message, and although I don't  want to give much out, I want to say that Toradora teaches you what love truly is. It is acquired by being yourself and not being afraid to express your own, true feelings. 
The art is not the best I have ever seen, but it is pretty amazing, still pleasing to the eye. You definitely will not have a problem with the art of Toradora; it is simple and fantastic. There are times when the art is really fitting to the scene, reflecting upon its meaning, leaving me in awe. 
Toradora's soundtrack is something that doesn't really stand out, but is fitting for the whole anime. When there are comedic scenes, there will be joyful music and when times are getting rough, there will be sad music. It's nothing extraordinary, but needless to say it is still great. 
The characters are another reason why I love this anime so much. There are 5 main characters: Ryūji Takasu, Taiga Aisaka, Minori Kushieda, Yūsaku Kitamura and Ami Kawashima. They have a complicated relationship with one another, but that's what makes this so realistic. Friends are not always nice and friendly with each other, but things do happen. Life happens. Each of them have their own unique personalities and fit extremely well with the story line. To be honest, I love all the characters and I can relate to many of them. Be sure to pay attention to the anime because there are so many little details that are extremely important and reveal SO much about the characters. The main female character, Taiga Aisaka, and the main male character, Ryūji Takasu are extremely fun to watch and always managed to steal my attention , getting me completely hooked to the anime. 
If it isn't obvious enough, this anime was beyond enjoyable to me. I loved every single minute and even though I am satisfied with the ending, I can't stop wanting more Toradora. Yuyuko Takemiya did such an amazing job with this anime, and I want to thank them for creating this masterpiece which in my opinion exceeds Clannad. If you don't watch romantic comedies, definitely give this a try, you won't regret it. If you like romantic comedies, I can assure you that you will be more than satisfied with this anime, and hopefully it will leave the same impact on you as it did on me.",10
"
                When it comes to watching anime, I really consider myself more of a marathon runner than a sprinter.  Usually I like to take my time and watch a couple of shows simultaneously, so 24 episode series usually take me like 3 or 4 months to finish.  Therefore it’s something of a testament to how much I liked Toradora! that I wound up finishing it in a mere 12 days.
Admittedly after watching the first episode I wasn’t overly impressed with the prospects for Toradora!  It seemed like it would be a show with a slightly unique take on the rom-com if nothing else
                  and be pretty good.  And the first few episodes in the series were very funny and enjoyable but didn’t particularly stand out.  It’s a slice of life/school life series so there isn’t really much in the way of a linear plot but as the series goes on you see the character interactions start to become more significant and the comedy takes a backseat in order for more serious issues and developments to be brought up.  The more I watched, the more interested I became in watching how the characters interacted and how the story progressed.  
What was great about Toradora! then was that it started off as a light-hearted tale of two misunderstood love-struck teenagers but developed into a great story about growing up and finding your place in the world, even if you are a dragon looking for understanding and acceptance in a world where people think that you want to eat them because of your intimidating appearance.  Personally I love shows that start off with a comedic tone and get more serious as they progress so this was a huge plus for me, plus it had some of the most touching and (Tora)dorable moments of any anime I’ve seen.
For a slice of life/romance story with a fairly tried-and-true plot to stand out, there tends to be a need for a strong base built in your characters in order to set yourself apart.  This was probably the best aspect of the show because all of the characters were unique, flushed out, and on the whole very likable.  All of the characters were stood out in this anime and I can even say that down to the supporting characters I enjoyed everyone in Toradora!
In order to see a prime example of why the characters are so great and unique in Toradora!, all we need do is take a look at Ryujii, one of our love-struck protagonists.  Although he has the eyes of a delinquent, which leads people to think that he is a bad person, in all actuality he is one of the kindest, most caring people you could ever meet.  This theme of initial superficial appearances being different from what lies beneath is eventually applied to all of our main characters as the story progresses, which becomes the most interesting, realistic, and gripping part of Toradora! As we are given characters who, over the course of the show, have good development and display a wide range of motivations and emotions.
The best example of this would probably be a tie between Minori, Taiga’s best friend and Ryujii’s crush, and Ami, Kitamura’s childhood friend and a stupid Chihuahua (at least in Taiga’s eyes).  Minori started off as the sunshine of the show and brought about some of the best comedy in the series.  As the story progressed though, she became gloomy and distant, and her actions seemed totally out of character.  This total change of character and the reasons behind it was one of the aspects of the story that made me frustrated and confused but also kept me interested and made me want to keep watching to discover the reason.  As for Ami, when she was first introduced I figured that she was there to be the bitchy, prissy, “everybody look at me girl,” which she was for a while.  Once again though as the story progressed she showed that she was the most emotionally perceptive character and that even for someone who seems so mature and has the world figured out, it turns out that she’s just a normal, confused high school kid trying to find her way in life like the rest of them.  The only person who really didn’t seem to stand out to me in terms of character growth or development was Kitamura, Ryujii’s best friend and Taiga’s crush, who seemed mostly to be there for comedic effect in the end.
Moving on to the main protagonists I have to say that they were also very unique and showed some great depth as well.  Ryujii’s struggles with managing school, household chores, while at the same time trying not to be perceived as a delinquent were very realistic and I liked his generally kind and caring personality.  In addition to that his growth and maturity over the course of the series really developed nicely and he certainly impressed me as a character.  In regards to Taiga initially I have to say I was not very thrilled.  She seemed like she was going to be your typical tsundere with the whole “I’m your master so quit being a perverted dog” relationship with Ryujii for 25 episodes (her being voiced by Rie Kugimiya certainly didn’t help this case either).  Yet as the story went on you see that perhaps she is just socially awkward and doesn’t like her life of being feared and alone.  When you hear about some of the stuff that has happened to her you really have to sympathize.  Not since watching Fruits Basket have I seen parents be such assholes to their children like Taiga’s were to her.  Her developed background over the course of the series really made me like her more and her relationship with Ryujii grew and developed nicely from what it was at the start of the series.  Plus, she loves Christmas.  My stance is that anyone who like Christmas is alright with me.
The art for Toradora! was absolutely fantastic.  When at first I wasn’t particularly impressed by the story, the art kept me coming back.  Throughout the series it was always consistently great but then at times it seemed like the animators said, “You know what?  Let’s make the next scene look awesome,” and would then proceed to do so.  Sometimes it was only subtle effects but it was enough to make me love Toradora! for, if nothing else, how unique and impressive it looked.  I have seen other J.C. Staff works and I have to say they really brought their A-game for this production because it looks like none of their other works I’ve seen or anything else I’ve ever seen for that matter.
The voice acting in Toradora! was really fantastic as well.  It’s a pretty experienced and well-known cast who I felt all did great, although I particularly enjoyed Yui Horie’s performance as the super-weird and energetic Minori.  When it comes to theme pieces in anime I’m pretty easy to please.  But surprisingly for a show that I loved so much I did not like the theme music at all.  Once again the show was unique in this aspect because the music was like nothing else I’d ever heard before.  Unfortunately for the most part this meant that I just skipped over them or blanked them out, with the exception of the first ending, “Vanilla Salt” sung by Yui Horie, which is actually one of my favorite anime pieces of all time now.
In the end all I can say is that I couldn’t possibly recommend Toradora! any more.  If you’ve dropped it I say go pick it back up.  If you plan on watching it I say go start right now.  There are some things about it that people aren’t going to like, it’s going to be the same for all media and I for one can acknowledge what some of these aspects might be.   However for a show that I enjoyed so much there is no possible way that I couldn’t completely recommend it.  Worst case scenario you waste a few hours of your time and walk away with a nasty taste in your mouth.  However it seems like there's a good chance you’ll walk away after finishing Toradora! having watched a great series.",10

                Quick Synopsis: 
Ryuji and Taiga find out through an amusing accident that each of them has a crush on the others best friend. They form a loose agreement to play the other’s cupid, but because taiga lives alone and also right next door, they end up eating together, waking each other up in the mornings and going to school together, all in the name of their matchmaking ploy. Both of them are mushy messes around their heartthrobs, so they spend much more time with each other, plotting the next hookup or going through various trials in their friendship and only wind up with a few
                  severely awkward moments with their targets.
Story&Characters
It’s easy to pass off Toradora as just another tsundere romantic comedy with the same gags, character archetypes, character pathologies, and sitcom-esque setups that create awkwardly romantic situations. Indeed the characters start out lifeless and generic. The “dere” part of Taiga’s tsundere personality is cloyingly sweet, as if she is a maiden who hasn’t so much as had her skin defiled by the touch of a boy. The “tsun” part is unreasonably disagreeable, violent, and straight up mean. Ryuji always gets this end of her moody personality, and it’s difficult to see any human being with a semblance of pride and self respect standing the insult and humiliation he receives from Taiga, but he actually begs for more. Only a diagnosis of a severe masochistic disorder along with horrible self esteem could explain that. Suffice it to say the two main characters have an unnatural and off putting relationship at first. As the series moves on, it switches gears completely, but gradually, to a high school drama. The objects of the two main characters’ affections, a hyperactive girl, Minori, and an overly enthusiastic brown noser, Yuusaku, who were nothing more than gag fodder in the earlier half, as most side characters in tsundere/harem romantic comedies are, become fully fleshed out, though not particularly nuanced characters. In fact, the gags all but disappear after the halfway mark. Taiga, though still easily categorized as “tsundere,” becomes almost unrecognizable from what she was early on in the series. Her character mellows out a lot; she gets to be more apologetic, and because of this, her relationship with Ryuji, though still on the sadomasochistic side, at least resembles a healthy friendship.
The series then goes all out Asian Soap Opera, pulling out love geometry complex enough to stump a math major, family dysfunction, and the ubiquitous trials that friendships are put through due to crushes and the resulting jealousy; basically every trick a typical Asian TV drama has for dragging the tears out. Toradora is indulgent with the melodrama, and it’s hit or miss. It’s usually quite deft when it comes to the central romance and family problems. The situations and the ways the characters face them feel genuine, enough so that most people probably can find some common denominators in their personal experiences. The love and affection is surprisingly down to earth given the tsundere premise. No tearful kisses, thank god. The same amount of melodrama is applied to the characters’ friendships, but not to the same effect. Jealousy is the culprit of nearly every friend-to-friend conflict in the series, but melodrama is something that inherently does not suit that emotion. Envy is brooding and dark, not loud and whiny. There is but one character that comes close to expressing jealousy believably, but in the end, she, like all the other side characters, are simply “dealt” with, unnaturally resolving complex issues in simple ways so that the final BFF ending can happen. When melodrama goes wrong, it really goes wrong, and there may be scenes that are corny enough to make you want to plug your ears, close your eyes, and god forbid if you’re watching with a friend, laugh awkwardly to hide the embarrassment from the fact that you actually agreed to watch something so darned cheesy. I can easily see how one might feel differently, but if you ask me, the payoff tear jerkers are worth the occasional bits of torture.
Animation&Sound
Toradora is definitively superior to any other Anime drama I’ve seen in terms of animation. The character designs and vibrant color schemes in clothes and hair are reminiscent of fanservice-y harem gag comedies (which Toradora is quite far from), that is to say, they’re not particularly inspired or impressive, but the characters are consistently well animated, with none of the excessively stiff motions that most high school dramas, especially of the shoujo/josei variety, seem to get away with. Then you have those few sequences with animation beautiful enough to make nearly every action series green. It’s rare enough to see such liberal use of high frame sequences with impressive key animation in any TV series, let a lone a drama. There is one real fight scene, and the rest of these sequences are used on climactic chasing, fleeing, or falling. The fight scene aside, good animation may seem wasted on a drama, but it actually provides a much needed element that Anime sorely misses over its live action counter parts in the same genre: physical expression. The physical expression in Anime melodrama is way too basic. We’ve all seen chase scenes before: the characters run with robotic arm and leg motions, and the only form of physical expression is scrunched eyebrows indicating concern or worry for whoever is being pursued. The same scene in Toradora would have fully animated the pursuer’s body mechanics while sprinting; it would have shown slight random stumbles and slips while turning corners, all of this serves to highlight desperation that when expressed physically adds a layer of emotional depth over some generic verbalized thought like “please be okay…”
You would think that the production value would also apply to music, but it’s sadly absent, or so passive and muted that it might as well have been absent at the most crucial, climactic moments of the story.
--
Toradora is well paced in that it weans the viewer from comedy to drama gradually, but it never successfully integrates the two. In the latter half of the series a few old gags pop up very rarely, but they feel forced and unnecessary. People will probably have different opinions on each half of the story. To me, Toradora is generic and uninteresting as a Tsundere comedy. It doesn’t have a knack for laugh out loud humor, and Anime is saturated enough as it is with Tsundere gags. As an angsty, melodramatic high school drama, it’s painful to watch at times, but the frequent tear jerkers and occasional poignancy make the series worth finishing.",7
"
                *massive spoilers*
If the anime had the pacing and interesting twists like in the first 4 eps that got me hooked to it, then I would have rated it a 9. However, the paced slowed down considerably, the filler eps did nothing for me and the ending was a little too….. much for me. I mean, yeah you two like each other and stuff, but deciding to get married without actually having experienced life as a couple? That’s BEYOND dumb. Which is precisely why anime school children shouldn’t be considered a benchmark for romantic relationships, and precisely why they *are* considered a benchmark.
Needless to say, I
                  didn’t like the ending because it was farfetched, cheesy and melodramatic.
If I had to only rate the 1st quarter, I’d give this anime a 9.
From eps 5-16, I’d give it a 6.
From eps 16-25, I’d give it a 7
On the plus side, though, ep 16 was the most beautiful/outstanding ep for me from the entire series. It was beautifully written and steered clear of romantic cliches, which I’m sure all fans enjoyed. 
A lot of things didn’t make sense to me, like:
# Why didn’t Taiga confide in her best friend about her crush?
# Why didn’t Taiga speak highly of Ryu in front of her so that she could see him in a better light? That’s literally the first thing to do when your buddy likes another buddy of yours
# Why is she more comfortable sharing her emotional issues with Ryu (except the daddy problem) than her bestie who she’s known for years?
# Why is Ryu so worked up when he sees Taiga upset on the stage during the paegent, but is totally chill when his best bud has a meltdown and colours his hair? He didn’t even *bother* getting to know what happened. If he wanted to give his bestie “space” then shouldn’t the same thing have applied to Taiga?
# Why does Ryu put up with Taiga’s constant physical and verbal abuse? Verbal I get; they need to make us laugh. But the constant and unnecessary physical abuse? Really? He obviously doesn’t like it and has said it out loud but why does he do nothing to stop it?
# Why is Taiga such a bully? I mean you can have a cold and “ruthless” demeanour without having to be such a bully to Ryu. The way she treats him is unacceptable, especially how she just demands things from him – like cooking her food or sewing her clothes. 
# Why does the bestie ask Taiga to be friends when she confesses her love to him? Either say yes, or say no. What’s this “friends” business which isn’t even explored (it’s completely ignored) in the series? 
# Since Ryu and his bestie both know Taiga likes him, why doesn’t Ryu just sit down and talk out his feelings with him? What’s the point of having Taiga hold on to something she doesn’t know the answer to?
# Ryu’s assumed to be a delinquent and he wants people to see him for who he really is. But this angle is explored only in the first 3-4 eps. For the rest of the series (barring 4-5 dialogues), this aspect is completely forgotten. Same with his habit of twisting his hair.
# I get that the mother is a ditz, but how the fuk are the grandparents okay with their teen grandson wanting to marry? HOW? 
# Taiga’s “reason” for leaving was fuking stupid. It wasn’t even a reason. Which still doesn’t explain why she didn’t show poor Ryuji the courtesy of a) telling him she’s leaving b) explain *why* she’s leaving c) do whatever improvement she wanted on herself by being by *Ryuji’s* side. Dumb girl.
There were other things that bothered me too, but then this review would be way too long. If anybody has any response to what I’ve posted above, please do drop by my profile. 
PS. I liked how it avoided many romantic cliches, which is why it annoyed me that the two MCs ended up together. Really? REALLY?",7
"
                This anime, when it had finished, had left me thinking and wondering. It had left me in a way where no other anime has made me felt before. It was a unique and different feeling than anything I've ever felt before. Whether it was to do with the dramatic yet subtle entrance, or the closing, last few moments that were intended to be light hearted but at the same time very ""deep."" This anime had left me with a feeling like none other. The dramatic twist and the steady trend to lead to the final conclusion that had (to most people) left to leave the
                  audience awed at how for once this was not a story to go with the obvious route that most had expected. Most anime do not take the turn that Toradora had taken, and that is what had made this anime beautiful and wonderful. The simplicity of this show as well, as it puts together the dramatic romantic scenes along with the light hearted comedic moments. It starts and finishes in two different lights, and when you are finished you are left to believe that these two parts were completely different, in which they are. This anime had found a way to make both the playful moments and the dramatic moments entertaining and enjoyable. The slow build up of emotions that is being piled up, the feelings that are flowing through behind the scenes, the inevitable conclusion that the two characters face. It all had led to Toradora being one of the best animes I have ever witnessed. I had found, no disappointment in this show, it had only left me with joy to the very end. 
P.S
If you want a deeper reason as to why Toradora could possible be one of the best romantic animes so far, (after you have watched if of course), then watch this review. But please, watch it AFTER Toradora. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fEkFtmIRU0

"
                OVERRATED. 
Whenever someone asks me if I have watched Toradora! That is the first thing I will say to that person. The story is overrated, the characters are dull and the ending is ridiculous.
Now I have your attention, the plot. The plot is a pretty average boy likes girl, girl like other boy, ends happy but not really type of boring story you will see in American rom-com movies that is so predictable you can see in coming 2 episodes in. The story is set around a male protagonist called Ryuji Takasu who is apparently considered a delinquent because of his eyes and because of
                  this feels he will never get a girlfriend. We discover he has been put in the same class as his best friend Yusaku Kitamura and a girl he has a crush on, Minori Kushieda. When he is at school he happens to meet the Taiga-chan, a short girl with a short temper which is why she is likened to a tiger and the two create a dysfunctional 'friendship' relationship based around on their crushes.
My friend and I reminisce about this anime from time to time and the initial reaction is how did we watch 25 episodes of this? It was terribly boring with a cast of people who were pretty uninteresting too and a lot of pointless episodes that just seemed like the studio had some left over money so put in a lot of filler.
The characters, I think, are the main thing wrong with this anime. We have Taiga, a short girl who seems to be ostracised for being short and quick to get angry which I have never seen in anime before ever. We also have Ryuji, a lead male character who is also ostracised for because people think he is a ‘delinquent’ because he has ‘delinquent eyes’ which seems like a really superficial thing for someone to base opinions of him to me but it is what it is. Then the other two, Minori and Kitamura, who seem to change their minds, attitudes and actions every ten minutes to benefit the main storyline. The interaction between the main characters seems really forced, with Ryuji taking a lot of grief  from Taiga and has to cook and clean for her because she knows he has a crush on a girl. I don’t know why he takes it for something that seems pretty trivial from where I am looking but there we go. 
The ending to this anime is just ridiculous. I vowed to have no spoilers in my reviews so I can’t say what the ending is but take my word for it, ridiculous.
I must say the start of this anime for me did offer some hope that I found something that would be good to watch but this hope was quickly taken away by the poor story I was being sucked in to. I also must say the dub and sub work on this anime was a good quality as was the art but it was quite easy to overlook these points with Toradora!
In conclusion, if you are looking for a first-class romance/comedy anime, run very far away from Toradora!",3
"
                Toradora. A rather different show. But an exhilarating experience that towards the end forces you to just sit back and enjoy the ride, with all the emotional ups and downs that accompany it. 
While not a unique concept, the story lends itself to exquisite execution, with a masterful telling of the hazardous, yet charming journey of two unlikely lovers. Even though no drastic measures are taken throughout the unraveling of the plot, by the end you feel a certain affinity to the entire cast which you can not claim felt for many other shows. And very little will leave you with the same warmth as
                  Toradora. You cannot help but don the same wry smile which Ryuuji and Taiga commonly share.
The characters are an excellent mixture of quirks and shortcomings; and with a broad array as well. While Minori is warm and inviting (though odd), Ami is cold and standoffish. And then there's Inko-chan. But to focus on the two main characters is to shine every spotlight in the world on the most gleaming part of Toradora's composition. Ryuuji is fierce-looking, but the kindest, sweetest soul there could be. Taiga, on the other hand, looks like a fragile doll, yet is every bit as violent as Ryuuji looks. When the two come together, a satisfying clash is created, where a viewer can almost see the chemistry and the making of an everlasting love. An incredible warmth is felt in the viewers' hearts at every interaction between the mismatched duo.  A warmth that makes one hope for only their best, and a warmth you certainly don't want to let go.
On the AV front, the show manages to excel by rarely ever having outstanding QUALITY as is commonly seen these days. Whether or not Toradora was able to escape the budget shortfalls of other anime, or if its funds were more excellently appropriated remains to be seen. One thing is sure: Toradora is a visual and audial feast of which calibur will rarely be seen again.
In short, Toradora is a fantastic adventure through the complex rivalries of relationships, and a believable telling of the formation of a very true love. It's a show with feeling rarely felt in any sort of medium, and a show that no connoisseur of romantic anime should ever dare to miss.",10
"
                Alright.  Let me begin by saying I had high hopes for this anime, I legitimately thought that I, like many, would love it and find it one of the best rom coms in a long time.
I cannot say that, and it pains me.  Thus why I feel obligated to write this review, so that those out there, like me, who find themselves on the fence about this show will know that it is not for everyone and could be called a failure in its key aspect.
But enough of that now, onto the first section.
Story:
This here is the key to my entire disappointment, this
                  section will cover the only flaw I find in the show(albeit one which breaks  this show) that's worth a really, really low score.  
As I intend to keep this spoiler free, I will do my best to be vague and as objective as a human can be.  Anyway, to start off,  I do have to give some sum up.  The show is about two people(Ryuuji and Taiga) who try to help each other find love with their respective friends(Minori and Yuusaku), but end up falling for each other.  Basic.  Simple.  Unusual for anime, but not unheard of in other medium. Yet somehow, the writers fail to appropriately dictate this correctly and botched much of could have made this show great.
Now then, let's point out some positives, as I'm sure you all are sick of my negativity.  This show has a great start, the two leads were fun to watch and their hijinks involved with the rest of the group, especially their attempts to woo their love interests was hilarious.  They kept stale traits of high school anime refreshing with new spins on old ideas that managed to really make them shine in comparison to any other show in the genre.  There's just one problem, there is no romantic chemistry between the leads, no build up in what should have been the best place for us to see them as developing feelings for each other.
In fact, the show almost negates feelings for these two, by showing how much interest each of them has in their two friends, Ryuuji and Minori have some great moments mid series that really show growth in their relationship and for the most part, there is a lot of reason to be seen of Taiga and Yuusaku becoming a genuine couple given time.
We even get another potential love interest for Ryuuji in Yuusaku's childhood friend, Ami Kawashima, who manages to steal a lot screen time and show a lot of chemistry also Ryuuji.  Which is not something that can be said of the leads and their relationship.  It is rather stagnant, with their characters establishing their relationship in this mess together early and hardly ever changing.
That is, until the writers realized this error and rushed basically the last quarter of the show with episodes shoving the two down our throats.  Everything becomes about their relationship, everything.  The side characters?   They push it forward or are obstacles that only drag it out another episode.  The story?  In the early series was a great mix of realistic setting with realistic reactions, to realistic settings with either ostentatious reactions or ones that are made entirely to drive the romance plot to its fulfillment in the last episode.
In case this section is TL;DR:  Most of the show and it's plot are good, but it fails in its most important moments and aspects.   Therefore it gets a 3 in story.
Art:
There is probably nothing bad to say about this show's animation.  It's fluid, energetic, and fits the show like a glove.  So for this section, the show gets a 9.
Sound:
Not something I am the most capable of explaining, so forgive my lackluster review of sound.   The music is fun and normally sets the ambience of a scene rather well, but never really hit a nerve in me.  Voice actors were great too, even the dub can probably be found enjoyable or considered decent by most people.  Therefore, for sound, this show gets an 8.
Characters:
Ah, we come to the absolute best part of this show and the key reason why I still hate how this show ended.  Every character, for the most part, is unique.  They feel like real people you'd meet, rather than fleshed out archetypes of a given cliche.
Save Taiga.  She's a tsundere, and that is who she is, for the most part.  How she develops beyond that is more often a reinforcement or explanation of her tsundere-ness.  It as though the writers crafted from pure tsundere the character that is Taiga, and this works to her benefit and detriment.  By which I mean to say that she pours out a lot of either aspect of tsundere, either she is full on tsun or full on dere.   The show usually managed to balance the aspects out, but there were often times where her tsun was simply overwhelming for those less appreciative of that character trait.
Again, though, beyond her, the cast is well rounded and, for the most part, real.  They act, they care, and they again, for the most part, grow as people.  It is rare that I find myself so attached to a group of characters, but this show captured my attention almost from episode 1 with them.  They were like friends I would have had in my high school days, which was perfect.
This section gets a 10, without a doubt.
Enjoyment:
I'll keep this section short, as I feel it is best summed up in the other parts.   Like I said, I enjoyed a lot of this show, from the beginning until late midway(give 9 or so eps left in the series), but the last section, where it tries to come all together breaks it, leaving us an ending that I personally found almost tragic, if truly studied beyond its assumed happily ever after, as one realizes much of what was said and done in those last episodes were done in the heat of the moment.  Many of those scenes were also then the cause of this show's end, which unfortunately means a rushed performance for the viewers and likely more than a few mistakes that could end in disaster for the characters.
Even though I had such a great time with this series, the bitter taste in my mouth and realization of the show's true end cannot let me give this part more than a 6.
Overall:
To bring it all around, I did have fun, I probably will still rewatch the earlier episodes on occasion.  But, a show like this thrives on its ending, which leaves a lot to be desired.  A pity, because this show was bound by its promise in concept, it failed to find what really mattered in it.  A story should be dictated by the characters and how they developed throughout, as this leaves them with the greatest, lasting triumph of being close to real.  It came so close, too.
The overall score is 7, for the earlier episodes, great music, art, and characters.",7
"
                Toradora is very good anime. It changes your life... for the better. In fact it's so good that if someone right now was about to tell me I was gonna die tomorrow, I would rewatch the whole series before leaving this beautiful Earth for my version of anime heaven. No matter what your background is, if you just don't get along well with your parents, if you didn't have the childhood you wanted or if you had or have love problems or if you just wanna smile at very funny situations and character dialogues... everyone can relate to the Toradora anime and characters in some
                  way.
Toradora is a story about Taiga Aisaka and Ryuuji that eventually grows into love story. It's a story of world of emotions and feelings that change through time. There are many funny situations, those lovely awkward love moments, interesting and cute characters. Everything you want from this anime genre mix-up: Comedy, Romance, School, Slice of Life. I won't go into plot details as not to spoil for those who might watch the anime. Let me say oly that: when you start watching it, you just can't stop until you watched the last 25th episode. Hint: make sure you watch the last episode right to the end past the end credits or you might miss the crucial epilogue.
Taiga Aisaka is 16-year old high-schooler. Due to her family situation and her history Taiga is very afraid of her own emotions. Because of her being teased by schoolmates (she is small and has small/no breasts for her age) and having some bad love experience she is also very insecure. She desperately wants to be loved and accepted by others. But feelings and emotions for her are hard to bear and she usually reacts with violence, even when liked by others. Taiga character is very good scripted and superbly voiced. It's no surprise her voice-actor Rie Kugimiya won Best Actress in the third seiyu awards for the role of Taiga Aisaka back in 2009. Taiga is a character that sticks to your mind, you cannot forget her. She levels the meaning of word Baka to new heights. So whenever you watch any anime, when some character says ""baka"", you instantly get smiles while thinking how Taiga would have said it. ""Baka Chihuaua"" or ""Baka inu"" .. and then you start laughing.
Ryuuji is Taiga's classmate. He's nice, polite, hard working. He always tries to help others, so is with Taiga with her one-sided love for some other person.
Thus he becomes friend of tsundere Taiga and slowly helps her to transform into a quite nice girl. He is very patient even when Taiga unleashing kicks ad blows on him. Because of this traits, he is a target for 2 other girls (very interesting and funny characters), which makes Taiga jealous.
Why do you have to watch Toradora!  ?
- because if you don't, you're missing it out on something very special here.
- because it is highly likely to change your life...for the better of course
- because if you don't, Taiga would probably say to you that you ""honto"" are ""baka inu"" and she will kick you and punch you.
What do you usually do when you're done  watching the Toradora series?
step #1: you say to yourself... damn, that was awesome!
step #2: after you realize there is no season 2 you get sad and angry...
step #3: you are so pissed off, you're really thinking of packing your bags and heading for Tokio to herras the Toradora producers to make season 2...but 
then you realize you don't have enough money for the trip...
What can you do if you still don't have enough of Toradora?
-you should watch the Zero no Tsukaima series and Taiga look a like Louise Françoise Le Blanc. She also has some cool ""baka inu"" quotes that will make you laugh for a while...
You ""honto"" should watch Toradora! you ""baka inu""!!!",10
"
                Why I liked this anime?
1.  Amazing characterization. 
The story has depth, with healthy and detailed character development.  With a cast of 5 mains which consists of 2 guys and 3 girls; with a flurry of recurring and supporting characters from parents, pets, to classmates and teachers---let's just say the load is massive.  However, to the success of the writers I felt they are handling the job well.  I will say some of the main characters were late bloomers however, through the progression of the story lines/arcs the writers were able to definitely reorganize and enrich them.  So where I initially
                  found them lackluster, the writers were successful in making them interesting to watch and get to know.   Added to that you can really connect with a lot of the characters. 
2.  Great story lines/arcs.
I definitely have to say there are arcs in the way the writers developed the story.  Because they have so many mains, to give them their dues there were arcs created to focus the specific main character and have the other characters respond to the actions, reactions, issues that arise.  So you're seeing the greater depth of all the characters as they are embroiled into the life events of one focused character.  You end up seeing the magnitude of emotion through anger, respect, laughter and tears each of these characters have with one another.  What's interesting is that this shows a depth that is transcended into the story.  So while some may not normally take a lot of animes seriously, this is one that gives you something to talk about.  The best statement I've heard in regards to the story is, ""pathos-invoking"" and I couldn't agree more.  The story and characters are definitely conversation makers.
3. The plot.
Basically romance and friendship arising in a high school.  Relatively cliche with twists and turns: meaning?  The plot moves from what I consider the cliche to the complex fast.  There is what I find, and liked, that the romance is more like a confused emotion for deep gratitude. Lots of these kids, when you're seeing their personal life are angsty kids living in a lot of drama; but it's the angst that provides a lot of understanding into them and they seem rather normal teens to me.
Some of the things that I found problematic.
1.  Slow development.
With some of the characters, I found them to be cardboard cut outs because they did nothing in the commencement but eventually did come into their own.  The problem with this is, is that it feels a little too sudden.  As though contrived.  It's very annoying to see the transition sometimes, because it seems the characters are a bit OOC. 
2.  Cliched teen angst.
Okay, I even summed this show up at times to Dawson's Creek without a creek and animed.  I remember, when I was in High School my favorite saying was that I was, ""Dawson without a creek and female.""  It just felt liker continuous angst.  So a lot of the time if you're a teen angst watcher or experiencer, you might get a bit annoyed by this.  Everyone sort of having feelings for everyone, or so it would seem, and no one knowing what they're doing.  
3.  Token characters.
Actually this is the most annoying for me.  Because I definitely did feel [initially] that a lot of the characters were token (this feeling does change through time).  This is very different from the novel version of the characters.  However, I put that down to compression problems and the art.  Meaning that the producers/writers on the anime have to deal with taking several volumed/chaptered stories and making it all fit.  So what happens?  A bit of lost translation of the full feelings or meaning of feelings by the characters.  This is also affected by the problem with the art.
But keep in mind this was later changed since the story develops more through specific arcs for each character bringing them out of token and into complex.  So the art and compression issue are small limits that are later broken through.
4. The art.  
Overall the art was fine.  Yet, I find the problems in really understanding the full meaning of the character or just the character in general is because of expression. I can name several animes in which the art was breathtaking and you really get into the characters.  Yet, in this one, I find it could have been better.  I felt in a way it affected the characters negatively rather than positively because their expressions just were either not fitting or unnecessary or a weird to interpret.
Overall?
I'm loving it, meaning I loved it!  Definitely a nice story and I think with some of the faults I found a great deal more of pleasure because the pleasure was on a regular basis, the faults can be easily ignored or later changed.  I do think it's a fun, ecchi (not as ecchi as it could be), slice of life story broken in by major teen angst.  Good stuff and definitely a great watch.   I recommend reading the manga and novel",9
"
                Having seen this anime five times now, I find myself wondering what it is about it that keeps me coming back to it over and over again. I would say at its core, it’s the characters. The characters aren’t particularly unique in design, and you could certainly break down the various character tropes and archetypes. But here the characters have such distinct personalities and are so fully realized, that by the end of it, you feel like you know these people. You care for them.  Take for instance Aisaka Taiga, the main female lead. On the surface she’s your typical tsundre character archetype. She’s
                  aggressive, pushy and rough around the edges. But unlike a lot of tsundre characters, she has a lot of depth to her. She carries a lot of emotional baggage, and is actually quite fragile. Because of this, her actions are often underlined by her emotional struggles. It gives her actions meaning.  Even someone that isn’t a fan of tsundere type characters could emotionally connect to her and have empathy for why she is the way that she is. Or at the very least, there is an understanding to the actions rather than her just doing things to fulfill an archetype. Her personality is actually backed up by the things that shaped it. And that, in a nut shell is why this show is so special. You could look at Toradora! as a rom/com slice of life show on the surface, but it really has a lot more going on underneath everything. 
Outside of the characters, the show really does a great job balancing humor, romance and drama. Every episode is enjoyable on a basic entertainment level. But just as I described the characters having more to them then you would expect, so do most of the episodes. Often an episode has an underlying message or emotional story to tell. And the show just oozes with charm. I can’t emphasize enough at how likable the characters are, and how enjoyable most of the situations in the show are presented. As a result it’s a slice of life show where even the mundane actions are both enjoyable, but often feel like they have some kind of deeper weight to them. That’s an extremely tricky thing to pull off. But it’s because the characters are fleshed out, that these scenarios often feel like they are either building towards something greater, or is a deeper reflection of something that the character feels deep down inside. Because of this, even episodes that don’t have drama or a big moment to push the plot forward, still feel rewarding.  
The romance in this show is complicated.  But it’s because of this that I really appreciate it. Way too many romance stories are either I. the typical fairy tale romance where two people fall in love, and everything eventually falls into place. II. An extreme amount of drama and pain and suffering.  Toradora! Is a lot more subtle about a lot of these things. Don’t get me wrong, the show can become really melodramatic at certain parts in the plot.  But it feels more realistic in that, the drama is built up to, and even when it unfolds, it’s not straight forward in how it’s dealt with.  Often romance is complex, especially at a young age. And while Toradora! Is far from being a realistic drama, it’s actually one of the most realistic romance’s I’ve seen in anime, and it feels very raw and real.  The way characters deal with their emotions (or don’t deal with them), is really what makes the romance feel like something special (vs. a typical hyper-realized romance).  But perhaps the reason the romance works so well, is because the show doesn’t just view romance on a surface level (such as infatuation/attraction). While we get to know these characters as the show progresses, so too do the characters get to know each other.  And so, the romance feels more realized, as the relationships and the human connections start to shape their feelings.
Toradora! subverts your expectations, as it begins with a lot of the things that you would expect from a rom/com typical anime.  Taiga comes off as a typical tsundre.  Romance is portrayed by infatuation and surface level attraction. To be clear, those are actually very human traits.  Often when we fall in love with someone, it’s an unrealistic and “romantic” kind of love.  It is infatuation and attraction.  And so those elements are fine. But often romance in shows are only left to that, and as a result when the actual romance happens, it doesn’t feel as if the romance is based on anything beyond infatuation. Toradora! starts off this way, but as the show progresses you quickly realize that these characters are more then they seem, and the feelings they have change and grow as their relationships and experiences start to shape them. And ultimately, this is why Toradora! really is one of the best romance’s in Anime. 
This show isn’t perfect (what show is). If I had any gripes, I would say that there are plot elements that could have been handled slightly better. It’s not that the show didn’t have enough time, so this isn’t a case of where things were rushed. Rather, it was their choice on how they focused on certain things, that can kind of feel like a misstep. I won’t go into details as I don’t want to spoil anything substantial. But I’ll just say this, everything that is intended in the show, makes sense logically if you step back and take it all in. However, their focus on certain elements might make a certain plot development feel kind of rushed for some. If you understand that feelings and emotions are supposed to be developing in the background (even when characters aren’t necessarily showing it), then it makes more sense in the long run.  Conversely, I also had a problem with the ending with regards to this criticism of focus. Before I scare you off, the show wraps up in a fulfilling way. Some might be torn on the ending itself, but don’t worry, you will be satisfied with everything prior to the last 20 min, and the ending itself doesn’t change anything or move the plot away from the resolution.  But because the story is written in a way, where I personally feel it could have done a better job explaining what they were going for, it does come off as a little jarring and disappointing. But again, this is a case where if you step back and look at the bigger picture, the actions do make sense. Thematically it makes sense. And if anything, I think apart of the disappointment comes from the fact that you’ve come to love these characters so much, you just don’t want it to end. You want more. You’ve seen the journey, and the resolution. Now you want to see them enjoy that resolution. THAT is where I feel some of the disappointment comes from.
To wrap this up, I really think this is a special show.  I think it’s easy to look at this and not understand what all the hype about it is. On the surface, there isn’t anything particularly unique or special about it. There isn’t any insane action, drama, or world/conflict being set up. It’s a slice of life/rom com.  But what makes it special is the characters, and how fleshed out they are, and how it handles these characters emotions and their journey as they grow.  Not only that, it’s funny, romantic and charming as hell. This a show where you will be both entertained while also getting a little more than you bargained for.  And so, while I won’t be so bold to proclaim this as being one of the technically best anime, it’s really the overall package and how it all comes together, that really keeps me and many others coming back for more.",10
"
                Toradora! ...where do I start? I just finished this anime and I'm still smiling. The story is just absolutely wonderful. The anime was so wonderful that I had to write a review for it right away while everything was fresh in my head. If you love anime that has great, unique characters, love-polygons, and comedy that will make even the saddest bunch laugh then you'll definitely love Toradora! At first, the title really didn't interest me. That's the first thing we all see from an anime and that is its TITLE! The next thing we see is the cover art. I saw the title and
                  I thought ""toradora!"" ? doesn't really sound interesting. I read the genres and saw the cover art and I told myself that it didn't look half-bad. Boy... I was wrong about the anime, I started watching it and didn't stop till the next day. I skipped my dinner and sleep for this anime and i'll break it down for you guys right now.
~STORY
Just let me start off by saying the story is unique and extremely cute. I would even say it rivals that of Clannad but in the end, Clannad still squeezed through by a bit but I'll leave that for another review. Toradora! will seem like the typical love story at first where a boy loves a girl and another girl loves the boy's best friend, so the two team up to help each other out. Yeah... it's pretty typical, but the creators did such a good job at leading the viewers to think this for a good 15 episodes until you suddenly start to see the change in the story... a change that was pretty unsuspecting to the viewer. The climax of the anime was not anti-climactic whatsoever, the creators did a wonderful job at keeping the viewers on the edge of the seat wanting more. The ending made my heart ache at first but then a sudden twist that relays a message from the beginning of the anime got my heart to skip a beat and just made me fall in love with the anime. The ending to Toradora! is one of the cutest endings ever; it would have been the cutest ending if had not been for Clannad to take first place there. Toradora! is the second anime to have ever made me laugh and cry and jump out of my seat in excitement. I gave the story a score of 9 because even though it was one of the sweetest stories I have ever heard, I still felt that Clannad is still ahead.
~TRUE SCORE: 9.5/10
~ART
The artwork was eye catching. The artwork definitely did it's job. When the scene called for a serene atmosphere, you got it. When it called for an eerie atmosphere, you got it. When it called for a cute and sweet scene, you definitely got it. The artwork covered all range of the spectrum even during moments where it called for extreme dramatization. The title of Toradora! didn't really catch me at first, it was the artwork that reeled me in and convinced me to watch it. I gave the art an 8 because it was definitely great, but there were some scenes when I thought that they could have done better. (i.e. the bird was a bit to... comedic)
~TRUE SCORE: 8.5/10
~SOUND
The sounds of the anime were your typical anime sounds, some sounds I've even heard from other anime. There's really not much to say about it. I'll talk about the seiyuus in the characters.
~TRUE SCORE: 7/10
~CHARACTER
The characters were amazing. The development of each character definitely excelled among other anime. You learned about each of the main characters and majority of the supporting characters. The anime included a comedic relief in multiple forms but did not overdo the comedian. The two main characters would be Ryuuji and Taiga. The way they really made these characters are just... I really have no words to describe how much I loved those two. Despite Clannad receiving a higher score, the characters of Toradora! and Clannad are perfectly even here. They didn't leave out any characters nor did  they cut short on any characters. They definitely gave it some thoughts on their characters. They gave Taiga a personality you would call a tsundere but the way they tackled it felt like they didn't rush it nor push the personality on her. The way she changed was subtle and excellently executed. The seiyuus they chose for the characters really did match how I would imagine the characters to sound like. Especially that of Aisaka Taiga. The reason why I loved the seiyuus they chose is because not only does the music, the art style, and location sets the mood of the anime but it's really the voice actors and actresses that seals the mood and they couldn't have chosen anybody better for each character.
~TRUE SCORE: 10/10
~ENJOYMENT
I was kept on the edge of my seat at all times. Even though I skipped my sleep and dinner, I neither felt tired nor hungry. I did not even yawn! The story was just too captivating and the comedy came at the right moments to really keep you glued to the screen.
~TRUE SCORE: 10/10
~OVERALL
Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anybody that loves a good love story. If you've watched Clannad and loved that then I would definitely recommend Toradora! Toradora! is just one of those ""must see"" anime, in my opinion. It includes drama, romance, comedy, and even a bit of action in a few episodes. I gave it a 9 because yes, I enjoyed it and this anime made it to the top of my list but my number 1 spot still belongs to Clannad, just by a little.

                Toradora! at first seems like a cliche romance series. There's been so many, it seems, over the years; it would have to take one outrageously different (yet subtly very simple and not complex) story to grab a person's attention and keep the viewer wanting more. After all, it's been done hundreds of times, and 99.9% of the time they end up corny or just plain stupid. I'm happy to say that Toradora! is a fresh take on a romance story, but with a major twist: the main characters aren't your typical main characters, and their interactions go above and beyond what's usually expected.
Story: 10/10
The story
                  is, of course, an outstanding 10 out of 10. I try not to give a perfect score unless something truly deserves it; but this time, I was genuinely (and very pleasantly) surprised. Toradora! definitely starts off a little awkward, and you may be tempted to just drop it as quickly as possible. However, I implore you to stay: the comedic moments and clumsiness at key times make the characters seem more and more like that one friend of yours that has (insert blank) personality. I was impressed at the honesty and stark portrayal of the characters; they bypassed my expectations, and continued to throughout the whole series. 
A little background that covers it in a little more detail: it so happens that Taiga Asaika has a crush in a guy named Yuusaka Kitamaru. It gets a little more complicated; Asaika's neighbor, Ryuuji Takasu, happens to like a girl named Kushieda Minori. What makes this so convoluted is that Kitamaru and Takasu are best friends, and Minori and Asaika are also best friends. So the natural thing to do would be to help each other out, right? Let's just say it gets interesting. Misunderstandings, awkward pauses, hilarious banter, and countless other little things happen; and through it all, you snuggle a little closer to each character, as they develop and progress. 
Art: 10/10
Oh, how can we forget the art? I try not to give art a 10/10 often; but here, something amazing happened; we got faces. We got the ""I'M SO MAD I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU"" face, the ""THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING"" all the way to ""THE WORLD IS DEPRESSED, AND SO IS MY FACE."" Good gosh, I've only seen facial expressions drawn in such human pathos only few times before. This sold me; from the first episode, it caught my attention and held it. The environment was drawn nicely, yes, so were the various objects or classrooms or homes. But you're not paying attention to such trivial detail when you can gaze upon these perfect, gorgeous facial expressions. I seriously became transfixed halfway through the episode. If you were to mute the volume and not understand a word of Japanese and not read the subtitles, you could probably still understand exactly what's going on. The arm movements and body posture were secondary; but this, THIS is something else! 
Sound: 9/10
So the 'sound' category encompasses not just the ED and OP, but the character's voice acting, sound effects, and background music. The OP I memorized instantly; catchy and bouncy, it was the epitome of the show. I always listened to the whole thing, simply because of the way it caught my attention so quickly. The ED was similarly tasteful, however a little dull since the mood of the OP and ED matched so nicely. I wanted something different to wrap up the anime rather than identical songs. The character's voice acting was astounding. Accurate and polished, I almost forgot I was watching anything; I became a character within, watching with my own eyes. The voices and characterization seemed so surreal and positively charming to listen to, I swear it was close to hypnosis at times. The sound effects were your typical stuff; things dropping, tables scraping, feet walking. The background music was almost non-existant; that disheartened me at times, but that also made the mood seem more stark in contrast to the events going on, so a little absent background music wasn't bad. 
Character: 10/10
Toradora! would've fallen flat on it's face without the cast of amazing characters. Just because Aisaka and Tukasu fit into that typical role doesn't mean the other characters did. Aisaka is and always will be a tsundere that everyone loves; a stereotypical one at that, conscious of her small stature and conflicting emotions. She continued to amaze me throughout the anime; her character arc was a roller-coaster of emotions and non-linear personality quirks; she changed as often as a guitar solo; never quite the same, but always going off on tangents. Takasu was your main protagonist, and the story was told mostly from his point of view; not that I didn't mind that. A neat-freak and woman-like about his household chores, he really symbolized a perfect house-wife(husband?) sort of person, yet was indecisive all the same. Kitamaru is brilliant, but lacks common sense sometimes. However, he knows more than he reveals, and continued to surprise me throughout the series, dolling out hidden information here and there that revealed his true self. Kushieda Minorin was probably the most interesting character of them all: she appeared the perfect air-head, incapable of knowing what's going on in the world around her. She almost pulls if off perfectly - except she reveals her true self a few times, notably to Takasu. Instead of an oblivious girl with no direction, she actually had inner theories and thoughts, and described certain feelings of hers with complicated metaphors; but that's what made her interesting. Ami, a character later introduced, seemed sort of a bridge for the other characters, providing a mental link, if you will, between Takasu and the rest of the gang. She's like that rickety bridge over a roaring river; sometimes, it seems like a good idea to trust her; other times, she seems as fickle as Asaika.
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Toradora! with all my tiger-like heart. What little flaws there were just simply faded or disappeared; there were too many good qualities that the bad seemed as insignificant as an ant. To put it bluntly, I loved this. I started off with a simple recommendation from a friend; but everything he recommended turned into a tear-jerker or epic action sequences; this turned out to be the latter. Instead of trudging to the next episode, tired and dejected from the previous one, I hurriedly and hungrily watched them as quickly as possible, because every detail was precious. After all, a dragon and a tiger can only do so much together...",10
"
                One heck of a must-seen anime from the lead voice actor/actress of Shakugan No Shana and ZnT with the same personality as well. It's like watching those two animes in a different level.
Imagine a normal rom/com school anime but the characters were Yuuji(from shakugan no shana) and Louise(Zero No tsukaima) and Shana(of course Shakugan No Shana). Based from the first ep I don't think this series is an ecchi ones, I haven't seen any on this episode.
The male protagonist is being mistaken as a delinquent student because of his eyes though his character and trait is more like Yuuji from Shakugan No Shana, nice and
                  doesn't seem to be an ecchi guy like Saito from (ZnT) because they both have the same voice actor same as well for Taiga.
The female protagonist, is like Shana + Louise = Taiga, she acts exactly the same, but this time she's the irresponsible one, not to mention Taiga also says &quot;Urusai, Urusai, Urusai!&quot; which was Shana's famous lines and &quot;Baka!&quot; from Louise
I don't want to spoil this series so just watch it for you to know better and I would suggest this one a worth watching somehow

                This is my first review so it may not be so good XD.
At first glance, Toradora may seem like any normal romance comedy anime. However, it has a combination of slice of life genre, romance and drama, not to mention its unique character personalities. 
Story: 9
The story starts off with impact, making you want to know more about the characters and how their relationships would develop. Once the story picks up pace, almost all the episode would have that slight cliffhanger and drama feeling at the ending and would make you go ""just one more episode"" until it ends. Also, the change between slice of
                  life and drama throughout the series is gradual and through many different scenes, unlike most rom com animes. I personally like how the story slowly builds up its drama, switches to romantic scenes, its sudden twist at the ending but  happy and complete ending. Most people think the ending was not clear or complete but after going over it a few times, I found it to be a hint for a nice sweet ending. I would like it more if there was an OVA featuring the characters' lives afterwards though. 
Art: 8
This anime has  relatively good graphics and character design. They have a unique style to their characters' eyes and hair,  especially that ""messy"" effect done on Taiga's hair.
Sound: 8
Love the OPs and EDs. I also loved how the EDs overlap with some of the dramatic ending of the episode, kind of making you overwhelm with emotions during the last few episodes.
Characters: 9
-Takasu Ryuuji
Main character. Very unique character. Scary looks but gentle personality type. 
-Aisaka Taiga
Definitely lives up to her tsundere loli queen title. One of the best tsundere girls XD
-Kitamura Yuusaku
I don't have much to say about him XD
-Kushieda Minori
She helps make this anime livelier and adds to the slice of life with her cheerful and unique personality.
-Kawashima Ami
I'm still quite unsure about her thoughts and feelings but she isn't that much of a bitch as the story progresses. 
Enjoyment: 9
One of the best love story there is.
Overall:9 
This series is one of the best anime I've seen and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a romance comedy or romance drama. This series is also quite realistic and the perfect choice for anyone new to non-action anime or anime in general.",9

                (2nd review :D I'll try to keep it short)
""If you trip while running down a hallway you will get a nosebleed. If you trip in life, you'll cry.""
-Minorin Kushieda
~Toradora!
You have that average romantic comedy mixed with high school slice of life. ""Boy meets girl, girl meets boy.""
So far nothing that interesting, then, why is it an 9? Not a 7 or less? In my opinion, it differs in plenty of ways from the average romantic comedy and I'll try to explain why.
Story: 8/10I'd compare its story to potato chips *--* 
It's kind of addictive.
You eat the first one, it's good, then you get another, and another, and another, when you realize you ate it all and sometimes wants even more. That's the feeling this show gave me.
It all starts with silly romance, turning into bittersweet love and ending with a little bit of drama. J.C.Staff managed to adapt the light novel into 25 episodes without leaving anything behind.
The plot is mainly about Ryuji and Taiga trying to find how they really feel and, what they want for their lifes. You get funny, embarassing and even more serious moments during the show.
Art: 10/10
It is not that awesome, you won't get those eye catching ""landscape visuals"" like the ones you see in ""5cent.persecond"" or ""Clannad"" neither the details like in ""K-ON"". Basically the main scenario is the school and its surroundings.
However, they focus into the characters drawing, giving them really convincing looks and expressions, something that is really important in these kind of romance/drama series. All the scenes were carefully animated.
I also enjoyed the colors and the animation they made for the 2nd OP/ED ""Silky Heart"" and ""Orange"". It matched with the tone of the music perfectly. 
OST/OP/ED: 10/10
(...)
Damn violins ~_~'
""Lost my Pieces"" ->  remember the name of this song because you'll never forget it. It may be one of the most touching I've ever listened to. The OST for this serie was so well done that even if the situation wasn't that touching, by hearing this song (along with ""Yuugure no Yakusoku"" and ""Yasashisa no Ashioto"") you'd get really depressed.
About the OP and ED, 'Pre-parade' was good for introducing the characters and all but I found 'Vanilla Salt' weird. In compensation I really liked 'Silky Heart' and 'Orange' since it followed the pace of the story. If you take a closer look, you can notice that the song summarize the events of the last episodes and show how the characters' relationships are progressing.
Characters: 10/10
Unique ones.
It's interesting because you have the characters that every high school classroom have with their own problems, but somehow they get to know each other better, and build up a friendship despite their differences. The (aparently) antisocial guy with scary looks, the hardworking class representant, the (weird) captain of the girls' softbal team, the (chibi) tsundere and (of course) the popular and beautiful transferred student (who's also a model). Mix them all and you have a interesting group.
Character development was also well done. You can notice that the OP change to 'Silky Heart' (that's much more serious) just when things gets less carefree and more tense between the characters. After ep. 18 you have more drama than comedy comparing to the first episodes. And you start to get the feeling that things are leading to an end.
I wish Ami would get more screen time... (I won't spoil here) but there was a lot more to show of her. She was put aside in the final episodes, like Kitamura (the difference is that his arc had already ended...)
Overall Enjoyment: 9/10
I bought the premium edition when it came out, and just finished rewatching it for the 3rd time. After all this time I can say: it's still exciting. Like I read in another review, it's a cute show. Relaxing to watch and heartwarming. It have its sad moments, but everything work out well in the end.
I consider it a must of the romantic comedies. Especially if you watched something like Clannad or Air that left that feeling of sadness/melancholy, Toradora! will cheer you up again.
Happy endings ftw! :3
It was longer than I expected... Hope it was helpful!",9
"
                If anime series can be compared to culinary dishes, then Toradora is without a doubt the Green Papaya Salad of this medium. It adheres to the guidelines of its peers yet, with its unabashed creativity, it distinguishes itself from the rest of the salads (or, in Toradora’s case, the rest of the rom-com series). It’s enriched by its irresistible sweetness yet the sugary sprinkles fail to disguise its more desultory features. It’s simply overflowing with fiery passion and yet there are more than a few instances where its energy becomes excessive. The Green Papaya Salad is an acquired taste more than anything else, a dish
                  that burrows it way into your heart bite by bite. Toradora is that dish.
Like most people, I regard my years in high school, my freshman year in particular, as one of the most unforgettable experiences in my entire life.I remember jeering at the B-movie flicks that my English teacher forced us to watch, I remember skipping my exams to chill at the McDonald’s down the street from the school. I remember stealing soda cans from the vendors at football games with my friends. I remember screwing around with my man Andre during our cross country practices; we intentionally ruined several drills at the JROTC camp that was near where we practiced, we tried figuring out shortcuts in our exercises, and I loved it. Nostalgia is among the most powerful emotions in the human psyche and yet this medium has struggled mightily to capture that nostalgia in its high school-oriented series. The Haruhi Suzumiya franchise attempted to express feelings of sentimentality for the pre-collegiate years but the effort fizzled out over time. Nichijou tried as well, albeit not as much as the Haruhi franchise, but ultimately it’s simply too consumed in absurdity for anyone to reminisce on their early years. Toradora, however, is the only series I’ve seen that flawlessly portrays the misty-eyed wistfulness of high school; it’s the one show that inspires pathos-filled conversations that begin with “I used to know someone in high school that was exactly like that” or “I remember when my friends and I did something like that.” Toradora’s excellence in its nostalgia factor is based on its interesting outlook on normal facets of the high school experience (like the student council), its overwhelming realism in its setting (extremely rare for mainstream anime these days) and its relatable protagonist.
Ryuuji Takasu is Toradora’s central character/narrator; he’s a likable neat freak with an apathetic worldview (think of Ryuuji as Kyon 2.0). What really defines him as a person, however, is his unwavering selflessness, and it impacts practically every action he takes throughout the series. Unfortunately, the character that most Toradora fans gravitate towards isn’t Ryuuji; not the one that receives the most depth, not the one that you’d feel any long-term sympathy towards. NO, it’s Taiga Aisaka. A mercurial midget with ratty brown hair, her screen time is consistently soured by her irritatingly entitled attitude (watching Taiga discover new ways to frustrate me inspires comparisons to Emi Yusa, a tsundere like Taiga, and her tiresome antics in The Devil is a Part-Timer). More than any other tendency, Taiga’s most unbearable trait has to be her penchant for unleashing larger-than-life temper tantrums. She enters the Rage Zone at the slightest provocation, she destroys anything or anyone that happens to be near the path of destruction, and for the most part, everyone’s okay with it because they’re afraid of her and also because…..
(wait for it)
(wait for it)
…..Taiga has daddy issues!
Look, I know that among the most appealing aspects of anime its its escapism, its deviation from realistic expectations, but at some point, we have to declare, “Enough is enough.” There have been plenty of Taigas that I’ve encountered in my academic career, plenty of self-centered prima donnas, plenty of edgy iconoclasts known for berating their peers, plenty of female students with hair-trigger tempers, and practically all of them were viewed as social outcasts; at the very least, their behavior was punished. The only just dessert that Taiga receives for her actions is a week-long suspension from school, the equivalent of a slap on the wrist. Fortunately, Taiga develops into a more likable character later in the series, a more tolerable character, a more sympathetic character, but just when you think Taiga’s redeemed herself, her old ways re-emerge at the very end. Well, Taiga had potential. I’ll give her that.
As a matter of fact, Taiga’s growth is among Toradora’s greatest strengths, for this show shines as a character-centric story more than anything else. The friendships, connections, and chemistry established through the members of the cast is what Toradora is best at, especially when it involves the main characters (a group of five that includes Ryuuji and Taiga). Ami Kawashima is among the group’s members; she’s a self-deprecating cynic that utilizes an innocent facade to disguise her true nature. Like an illusion, Ami pops in and out of each scene, dropping a few snide remarks from time to time but she really knows how to make her presence felt when needed (Her dynamic with Ryuuji is one of this show’s highlights).
Yuusaku Kitamura is another member. A rather lighthearted and silly kind of guy, Kitamura is Toradora’s most reliable presence (outside of Ryuuji and Taiga, of course), the mediator of school conflicts, and the object of Taiga’s affections (Johnny Yong Bosch, Kitamura;s English VA, is someone that I’ve held reservations about before but in this role Bosch sounds like he hasn’t had this much fun since Trigun).
Although Toradora normally doesn’t do much with its supporting characters, Yasuko Takasu (Ryuuji’s mom) is a notable exception. With her adorable airheadedness, intriguing double entendres and natural charm, Yasuko establishes herself as a star in Toradora’s constellation of characters (Like Bosch, the enthusiasm in Karen Strassman’s portrayal of Yasuko is radiant).
To be honest, Yasuko would’ve been my favorite of the bunch, if not for Minori Kushieda. Minori zigs while Toradora zags. She’s a lightning bolt while everyone else is a square. She’s a Playstation 4 in a room filled with Ataris. Minori isn’t just different from the other characters; she’s universes apart from them. An absolute force of personality, her quirky mannerisms, abiding avidity, and all-around eccentricism produces an overwhelming liveliness in the scenes she appears in. Christine Marie Cabanos completely steals the show in her groundbreaking performance as Minori; her marvelous highs are energetically delivered and her soul-searing lows are beautifully presented as well. Selfless to a fault, Minori constantly sacrifices her happiness and wellbeing for the sake of those she cherishes, and later on it’s flat-out heartbreaking to witness the effect that it has on her character. Ultimately, what Toradora lacks in a respectable female lead, the show more than compensates with the rest of its cast.
Do you remember when Death Parade began airing last year and practically everyone lost their marbles on what was probably the biggest hype train of 2015? (I was admittedly a member of the Death Parade Hype Train back then) Well, one of the most talked-about aspects of the show was its soundtrack. All anyone ever discussed was how gloriously emotional it was when, really, all Death Parade’s OST possessed was one magnificent track (“Moonlit Night”) and an assembly line of subpar somber songs with a jazzy feel to them. Toradora’s soundtrack is of the same vein. Produced by Yukari Hashimoto, the songs in this series are simple, forgettable melodies that are momentarily enjoyable yet fail to fully captivate the audience. Like Death Parade, Toradora’s OST contains a masterfully moving song (“Lost my Pieces”) but other than that, it’s hardly noteworthy as a whole. In short, the music in this show has received much more praise from its fans than it warrants and the same could be said of its dramatic appeal. In most cases, the emotions of a human being are akin to combining multiple drinks at a soda dispenser. We usually feel several emotions at once. Our current mood can be normally described in multiple ways. Very rarely do we humans feel only one emotion. Very rarely does our mood morph without warning. That said, the tone, the ambience, the atmosphere in Toradora is like a TV remote. One moment is soothing calmness while seconds later reveals blood-boiling fury. There is no subtlety, no graduality, no realism in how the characters feel. To quote Drake, Toradora’s mood transitions “from 0 to 100, nigga, real quick”.
The entertainment industry, as a whole, has established a name for itself as the dwelling where strange yet wonderful occurrences happen, and one of them is something I like to call “The Leap”. “The Leap” is a somewhat rare event in which a fairly worthwhile series recognizes its shortcomings and attempts to destroy them; as a byproduct, the series undergoes a period of significant all-around improvement. Basically, by repairing its faults, a good series becomes a great one. This is “The Leap”. For Toradora, “The Leap” commenced during Kitamura’s character arc, a controversial two-episode storyline that many have complained about but it’s one I enjoyed. As Kitamura endured a rebellious phase, Toradora spared some time to include other characters into the plot, like perennial slacker Kouji Haruta and straight-laced Hisamitsu Noto. Its emotional appeal progressed into something that was authentic and meaningful, its mood transitions developing with a measure of realism. It even bothered to include a couple of excellently animated (albeit brief) school fights (For someone who once viewed them as something of a religion, this was an additional bonus). For a while, it seemed as though Toradora could do no wrong; it was invincible.
Like all good things, Toradora’s Leap, the show’s awe-inspiring run of excellence, sputtered to a stop in the penultimate episode, It’s at that point where each and every one of Toradora’s deficiencies slithered their way to the forefront: its exclusion of everyone outside of the five central characters (and eventually three out of the five as well), its subpar soundtrack, its spontaneous tonal shifts, and even Taiga’s tsundere tendencies. In the end, the only thing that Toradora’s Leap did was temporarily repair its weaknesses (It’s almost like threading the ripped sleeve of a shirt back together and then wearing that shirt every day. Eventually, that sleeve will rip again). Despite its faults and its methods of fixing them, Toradora remains a show I’d recommend. It’s mesmerizing in its portrayal of high school, efficient in constructing bonds between characters, and excellent more often than not when it comes to humor. It makes you smile with its corniness and intrigues you with its intellect. Its first OP (“Pre-Parade”) might even cause your head to bob back and forth. All in all, Toradora is hardly perfect but, for better or worse, it never fails to be interesting, just like the Green Papaya Salad.",7
"
                Romantic Comedy is always an uncertain genre for ambitious anime. Generally speaking, ""romcoms"" are enjoyed because of their absurdity and good-natured humor while somehow managing to touch on the thinest strand of deep emotion within the romantic framework of things. It's ironically frightening, really, when Toradora! provokes more than enough honest thought and sweet sentiment underneath the camouflage of supposedly whimsical comedy.
-Story- 
Outstandingly intricate, the drama is suffused with originality and ironic wit, and it can be said that it is the story that makes Toradora! shine. While the obvious romcom tropes, such as Locked in a Room, Love Letter Lunacy, and the dreaded Drama
                  Bomb, are conventional, the permeating sense of disorientation and counterproduction remains pleasantly expressive. Comedy is relative to the viewers' tastes, but the shifts in pace are glaringly charming. Due to the romantic and comedic nature of the anime, predictability is relatively improbable. There is no awkward deus ex machina luxury so many other romcom anime fall back upon when the chronicling gets tough, and so Toradora! ensures a very special type of realism within the nature of comedy. The romantic element, in one of its rarest (and dare I say finest) forms, is hence born out of a carefully crafted maelstrom of natural sentiment.
-Art-
While there is nothing particularly facinating or prodigious about the artwork by itself, the appropriate expression of detail in respect to the context is satisfying. The general details and animation for characters and backgrounds are consistent, but nothing exceptional. However, the various angles within scenes hold appropriate value, and contribute well to the respective mien. The chromatic arrangement of characters seem to also provide minor aesthetic enjoyment.
-Sound-
The anime has a reasonable degree of auditory satisfaction. Voice actors were sufficient, if not suitable, for their roles, and particular OST, such as Lost My Pieces, provide applicable emotional triggers for the contextual atmosphere. The shift in OP/ED songs halfway within the anime invites the critical mood change smoothly. 
-Character-
Toradora! holds a character cast of interestingly complex personalities. Character development for the main two protagonists, Takasu Ryuji and Aisaka
Taiga, progresses at a versatile level of depth. Character interaction initially shows convenient stereotypes, such as the Misunderstood Loner, classical Tsundere, and Genki Girl: further development systematically dismantles a large component of the stereotypes, revealing distinctive rationale. The character cast is memorable, and it is probable that some degree of sympathy, if not empathy, can be concluded from the audience.
-Enjoyment-
I cannot claim that Toradora! is the best anime out there for everyone, even if enclosed within the genre of Romantic Comedy - but it is personally meaningful and freshly expressive to me. It is one of the few anime out there that, as poorly as it sounds, ""gets what love is"", applicable to romance (and I know many can/do/will disagree). It is an anime that isn't afraid to express another form of love in stark contrast to what is styled as the ideal true love only found in dreams and fantasies.
Love becomes something of a confusing, vast, overwhelming, and wondrous phenomenon - and I think that is why I enjoy Toradora!",9
"
                Toradora! Review:
Simplicity. Sometimes keeping things simple really makes a show something special, and that's exactly what Toradora! provides.
Story 8/10:
Like I said, Toradora is a very simple show. Being so simple, the story really isn't anything groundbreaking or unique. However, this doesn't by any means mean that it is bad. Toradora is about two students named Ryuuji and Taiga. The two each have feelings for the other's best friends. Ryuuji and Taiga spend the majority of the show trying to help each other get closer to their respective crushes. The show is primarily composed of episodes of various events that open up opportunities for Ryuuji or
                  Taiga to get closer to their crush. These are very fun episodes to watch, and although episodes like these in other shows tend to lack direction, every episode in Toradora has purpose in establishing the characters and directing the show towards the closing episodes. Toradora doesn't do many unique things with it's story, but what it does dish out are well executed episodes that only strengthen the simple story that it has.
Art 7/10:
The art in this show was very good. The characters all felt unique from each other from an artistic standpoint, and the varied locations were all well animated. It's hard to describe, but the art in this show just felt unique. It is much like the show in general, where there really isn't anything crazy different about it, but it somehow stands out in the crowd.
Sound 8/10:
Music wise, the sound aspect of Toradora was great. The OPs weren't my favorite at first, but quickly grew on me. The EDs are very catchy and some of my favorites. The background music fits the tone of the show well and does nothing but help set the mood of each scene. The voice acting also did nothing to disappoint. I loved Taiga's voice acting, and although I'm no expert in the world of japanese voice acting, I must say that I really liked the characters' voices as a whole.
Character 8/10:
The reason this show shines so much is probably because of the two main characters. Ryuuji is a teenage boy who, due to his eyes, is interpreted as a mean intimidating guy. However, he is really just a kind person who likes to cook and clean ironically. Taiga is a very short teenage girl who looks cute but is actually vicious and will not hesitate to insult or even attack somebody she dislikes. The dynamic and growth that these two characters have together is truly something special and kept the show interesting at all times. The side characters on the other hand can be much weaker. The side characters for the most part lack depth and can seem extremely one dimensional or just plain poorly written in a couple cases. Minori was the exception as she actually had different sides of her on display throughout the show. All in all, the dynamic between Ryuuji and Taiga is what really helps this department shine even though the supporting cast is unimpressive.
Enjoyment 8/10:
No question I loved watching this show. It's hard to put my finger on it, but something about this show had me hooked. It was a pretty laid back high school romance with comedy sprinkled around. Most shows like this tend to lack focus and feel like a huge set of filler episodes with no particular direction. But unlike the norm, Toradora stayed focused to it's plot and continuously moved forward instead of dilly dallying with pointless episodes. The show gets you to connect with the main characters and you can really feel the emotions that they feel, whether it be happiness, confusion, or sorrow.
Recommendation:
If you are into the romance/school life genre then definitely watch this show. It really is something unique and you should at least stream it.

Overall 7.9/10:
I know many of you will think that since I gave this a 7.9 that I should round up. But I really don't feel that it would do shows that really did get an 8 or higher justice. It would also bring up the question of whether or not I should round up shows with ratings like a 7.5 or 7.6. In my mind something like that would be outrageous because for me a 7.5 is miles away from an 8. Anyways, Toradora is a truly special anime. Its simplicity and ability to stay focused through a lighthearted story are truly impressive. The characters are very easy to relate to and there really aren't many real ""flaws"" to the show. The show is a perfect example of maximizing potential in a pretty average plot concept.
The Verdict:
Simple, yet special. Toradora is a one of a kind anime that is very hard to dislike.
Pros:
+Characters are easy to relate to
+Doesn't get off focus
+Can be very touching
Cons:
-Unimpressive side characters
-Safe plot concept 
If you liked Toradora! watch...
Golden Time:
Written by the same manga author and both have a definitely similar feel. Romance, initial love triangle, drama, and comedy.
Anohana - The Flower We Saw that Day:
Love triangles, drama, feels, and tears. Enough said.
7.9/10 - Very Good",7

                I decided to make a review on this coz people are praising this like it's the face of the Romance genre, it's not, I would argue Kaichou wa maid-sama but even that is flawed
Story: 1
there's hardly any story in this show tbh it's just about the two main characters love interests which got handle very poorly by the author, this is a poorly written ""love story"" I can't even call this a love story
first we have this the two main characters whom both have different love interests which means what's supposed to follow is both of them losing interest in their respective love interests while
                  slowly develop romance with each other coz they're the main characters for pete sake but nah that ain't what happened at all and you'd expect the show would utilize itself having 24 episodes, our main male and female MC still madly greatly in love with their respective love interests in the final 2-3 episodes of the show I repeat there's hardly any romantic development between the love square, female MC even hallucinated and mistook Ryuuji for his crush, Ryuuji still madly in love with Minori, mind you Minorin and Ryuuji was about to have a 1 on 1 convo/confess at each but no worries Taiga is there to ruin the day and went on a tantrum spree, you gotta let them angst come out amirite angsty teenagers needs break amirite and the next day (final 2 episodes) the two main suddenly wanna live in together coz they're suddenly on a relationship smh talk about forced romance this is the most forced romance I have ever seen ever I can't believe this is the most recommended romance, RomCom coz this is just bad most of the episodes got wasted on some random moe SoL and male and female mains failed attempts to their respective love interests with Taiga beating Ryuuji and Ryuuji being the ultimate white knight
Art: 5
hardly a matter in this kind of show coz they usually have a good to average art
Sound: 4
can't remember if it's the first or second but it has a decent ending song while I can't even remember the opening songs coz they're so forgettable
Character: 1
Minori and Yasuko are probably the only likable characters in this show while the rest are downright detestable, forced and badly written ones especially Taiga, guess I'd expect no less from a violent tsundere, there's even this Ami chick who was implied to actually likes our male MC too but nothing happen in the end she was just there for the sake of it, I mean why add a character who won't even confess and try with Ryuuji, such a pointless character again this is a harem in guise of a Romance, people needs to stop branding this a major Romance coz this is a RomCom harem and it's a bad one
Enjoyment: 1
the only reason that I would watch this again is so I can get even more details and more evidence of how bad this show is coz I've watch this back in 2010 and I actually thought it was a good show back then, people praise this like it's the face of the Romance genre even tho it's clearly not
Overall: 1
this is lowkey harem in guise of a Romance, if anyone asks for a recommendation of a Romance, I wouldn't recommend this but for a RomCom I will coz they're usually a random with most of their episodes with a plot next to nothing with non existent story development and for this romantic development. and this pulled the most forced romantic build up I could ever think of",1
"
                Toradora! is, in my opinion, a pretty solid stab at the Shonen-Highschool-Comedy-Romance genre that breaks the mold enough to be more interesting than other entries. However, due mostly to my personal tastes, a pretty lackluster ending and what felt like a rushed final few episodes; it fails to stand out as a great overall anime, and rather just a rather good Shonen-Highschool-Comedy-Romance. But let me break it down:
~STORY~
I have a big issue with the story, one that took me until around episode 16 to really forgive - that is that it should never have started at all. I don't count anything that happens in the
                  first 2 episodes to be spoilers, but others may differ so... SPOILERS I guess - Here is my issue: When a violent bitch of a girl breaks into your house and attempts to severely injure you and causes property damage because that was her first response rather than ""Hey, I put something in your bag that I wasn't supposed to, can I have it back please?"" YOU DO NOT BEFRIEND AND ULTIMATELY LOOK AFTER THAT PERSON. You should call the police instead. And look, I get it, it's a thing of the genre that Toradora! is in; that people don't react normally to crazy violence. But it caused me to stop being engaged with the anime!
But moving on - The rest of the story actually handles quite nicely, there are very few episodes that I'd consider 'wasted', rather each episode is used to reach the final goal (Unlike Nisekoi, amiright?) which is something to be admired in the genre. It helps that, save for our main protagonist, the cast aren't as dumb as a sack of bricks, which means the story can move about unhindered by needless stupidity.
However, even a great journey can be soiled by a lackluster destination, and this is where Toradora! stumbled over the finish line. First non-spoilers: To sum it up, pretty much the big emotional scene feels like it happens too suddenly (though to its credit, the show handles it well), then when the story seems like it may pay off to a satisfying conclusion, a hideous trope rears its head to create fake drama - but then almost completely undoes itself in the span of an episode with little rhyme or reason.
**SPOILERSPOILERS - Of course I'm referring to Taiga suddenly disappearing. It is hardly telegraphed, it serves no purpose except to serve up some kindergarten-style moral message (painstakingly given, mind you), it supposed to make you feel 'WHERE DID SHE GO, I WANT HER BACK' sentiment, but it invoked a ""well that was stupid and a let down"" sentiment (in me) instead. Not to mention that she appears, quite literally out of nowhere, at the very end, which desperately begs the question - WHY THE RADIO SILENCE IF YOU WERE JUST GOING TO SHOW UP ANYWAY!? Is it just to stupidly reenact a scene from at the start of the anime? What is the point? END SPOILERS**
And really, that is what bugged me about the ending - ""what is the point"", I would've been happy if it finished midway through the previous episode. ugh.
~ART~
I watched the bluray of Toradora! and there were some weird visual issues. I mean, no animation is perfect (unless it's done by ufotable anyway), but irregular proportioning and facial features being out of whack seemed to happen a fair bit more than other anime I watch. Other than that, it's just pretty standard, I guess.
~SOUND~
With the exception of one or two bits of OST, I didn't really notice or care about the Toradora soundtrack. Just more standard affair.
~CHARACTERS~
The story section made this review a bit long, so I'll try and be fast:
Ryuuji - Our main protagonist is as standard as they come. He can cook and clean, he's ""nice"" and he's thick as mud. He also has blue hair. His specialist perk is his 'scary' face. Really nothing else to say, so I won't.
Taiga - Ugh. I hate Tsunderes with no concept of self-control. It's such a tired cliche. Though, once she starts to stops being an annoyance, she actually starts to build character and become interesting. However one of her later 'developments' seems to happen way to quickly, though is still kept relatively quiet until the audience has already guessed it a thousand times over. Still, I haven't seen a pain-in-the-ass tsundere turn out so well in a long while.
Minori - Now we get to the good stuff. I actually quite enjoyed Minori, the... uh... dammit, if I talk about why she's a good character, it's spoilers! That being said, her bizarre 6th sense-type capabilities did make me roll my eyes a bit too frequently.
Ami - Apart from the whole ""protagonist made me a better person"" moment early when she is introduced, I felt like Ami was the most realistic character of the main cast. The way she interacted with the rest of the characters was actually pretty refreshing.
Yuusaku - I like him, he's great. He's quirky and silly; but also a serious-but-smiling character. There's a whole undertone of knowing more than he lets on, but doesn't try to directly interfere. I was really disappointed when he faded out near the end.
The rest - I like the teacher, she's a good laugh. The other side characters are... one dimensional, but not too disappointing. 
~ENJOYMENT~
All in all, I did enjoy Toradora! more than I had expected I would. I finished it over the course of a couple of days, and even had a couple of instances of ""just one more episode, I swear"", which is always a point in the anime's favour. However, what I found to be a disappointing ending, and my annoyance with the beginning, colours my view of the whole show probably a little bit more negatively that it probably deserves.
~OVERALL~
Although it certainly wasn't a genre I particularly enjoy, and one that is rife with cliches, I did enjoy Toradora! and found it to be a stand-out in its field. I guess it wasn't frequently recommended to me without reason. Hopefully what bugged me doesn't bug you, and you may enjoy it more that I did!

                Toradora is probably one of the best school life, romantic comedy, drama that even those who are not a fan of the genre would enjoy.
Story:7
Toradora is about a boy named Ryuuji who looks like a delinquint, but is actually very nuturing and kind, and a girl named Taiga who looks like cute, but is actually violent and what. They both have feelings for the other's best friend and thus the story begins. 
The concept sounds generic, but the humor along with the way the writers portrayed the story, and character's made it entertaining enough that re-watching it several times fans still enjoy it.
Art:7
The art is
                  strange, but at the same time portrays character's correctly. Ryuuji's eye's which are his most delinquent looking feature are at time's some what creepy, kinda Higurashi like allowing the show to easily express why people mistake his personality along with allowing viewers to easily pick up on character's emotions.
Sound:9
Toradora doesn't only have catchy opening's, and good voice actors (Queen of Tsundere!) The ost is also enjoyable. Probably the only ost I go back and listen to that doesn't have some kind of lyrics. The BGM manages to portray character's emotions whether they are having heated discussion, or having a serious depressing talk.
Characters:10
Toradora's main character's are all based on a single concept; people misunderstanding them. Since most people are misunderstood they become extremely relatable. I'm sure everyone has been judged incorrectly atleast once. Each character is complex and developed all thoughout the story giving all of them their own draw in unlike other shows where they give a character an ark then drop them off the face of the earth, or their actually not that bad and become friends with the protaginist.
Overall:9
Toradora is one of the few shows that made me shed man tears. (I can count on a single hand how many have done that.) This show will make you laugh, cry, freak out, and all of the above. Even if you don't like the genre, think it's to long, or whatever reason you have. Forget about it and watch it!",9
"
                Toradora starts out looking like any other anime. Misunderstood mean-faced guy, makes friends with what looks like a Tsundere character. I was a little apprehensive, having started this after finishing Lovely Complex-a tough act to follow. By episode 4 I was hooked.
Story : 8/10 While maybe not going along the most original of plot lines, two characters helping each other out to get the guy/girl of their dreams, eventually falling for each other, the way the story spans out is unbelievably original and quirky. It starts out strong and ends strong, but the middle for me was the golden period. I have never seen an
                  anime which so skilfully draws out the characters, slowly and carefully, like a bud blooming into a flower.
Art : 9/10 To be honest, I find it rare in an anime to be brilliantly drawn, all the time. Even my all-time favourite Kare Kano has faults. In Toradora I found characters, surroundings, colours and clothing to be drawn at a excellent style, consistently. The quality never dropped or changed, and rather than being faced with what looks like entirely new characters in certain scenes because of the way they are drawn, you are left with a comfortable, familiar, and brilliantly well drawn anime.
Sound : 6 (?)/10 To be honest, I only pay attention to the soundtrack if it is very, very, VERY good. And this one, while suited to the anime, has me only remember the first opening song (trust me, when you hear it yourself, you'll understand) and a piano piece that had some discords in it. I doubt you will watch this for the soundtrack though.
Character : 10/10 This is where I could find absolutely no fault. While Taiga starts out as your average tsundere character, she becomes so much more as you learn her past and all her little quirks (I dare you NOT to cry in the Christmas episode when she runs outside to find Ryuuji). Ryuuji himself is a selfless, honest and almost naive character perfect for a male lead (his acts of kindness towards Taiga will make you wish for a guy like him).
Another thing I adored about this anime, which lent itself to me easing out my Lovely Complex addiction, was the characters weren't just 'filler' characters. They each had a purpose and role to fill, even if it was only comic relief (Haruka and the homeroom teacher - I forget her name). Kushieda, Taiga's best friend and love of Ryuuji, is a highly eccentric but utterly stuck in 'friends first, herself second', more motivated than anyone I've ever seen to do well for herself, will make you laugh and make you cry. Kitamura's appearances are excellently timed for he seems to come along just as Taiga's doting on him, but he has his own reasons for excelling at school...
Enjoyment : 10/10 I dare you NOT to enjoy this anime, so well thought out I've rewatched it many times just to laugh at certain episodes. The ending will leave you satisfied but is not contrived in the 'and they all lived happily ever after' type of way. I laughed (mostly the kind when you have to stuff your face into a pillow to stop yourself from waking anyone up) and I cried (the type when you need a bundle of tissues at the ready) throughout this anime, all of which I avidly devoured in a matter of days (to the aggrivation of my parents.)",9
"
                Why is this anime so popular?
What I thought of this anime was that it was a waste of time. Yeah, the plot wasn't cliche and great overall. Yeah, the characters were kind of unique and well put. But then there was these characters that weren't in need of being there. Instead of developing on Taiga, Ryuuji and their best friends' relationships, they just wasted time by putting in events and characters to draw time. 20 episodes of nothing. 5 episodes equal the development and actual romance. The end was great, I guess, and when we saw them progressing on their relationship it was great. But
                  that was only a small amount of the whole series.
Sorry if this review was confusing. That it's my first review and that I watched the anime a year ago should explain it.",4
"
                As I honestly think back, tears come to my eyes. Toradora! was a emotional roller coaster. This roller coaster, with its twists and turns, really made me feel that life and love is not all its cracked up to be. Maybe it was the fear of heights, or the unimaginable speed, either way, I WAS moved.
Story(10): I did not want to simply dish out 10's, but Toradora! is with ought a doubt, a ten. Toradora! is the epitome of all rom-coms, it is the great anime that inspired many others. The story is a very original and heart warming feel, you will have trouble ever
                  finding an anime with a plot comparable to Toradora. If there is one anime that could even dare challenge Toradora in the love department, it would be Clannad. Toradora is one of the few animes that will physically render you speechless. It is one of the largest rides in the anime theme park. 
Art(9): Great details on characters and flawless scenery. 
Sound(10): In most anime I find myself just skipping the beginning and end credits, but not with Toradora!. The music was so perfect for the feel of the show, honestly a 10.
Characters(10): Two words, character development. Toradora! handles characters in one of the best ways I have ever seen. It is not biased with its opinions of each character, and does not fail to show details that will be used later on in the story. I honestly will not say anymore, I may begin to spoil the enjoyment of the anime.
Enjoyment(10): I honestly took my time watching Toradora!, I can compare it to the wait on the roller coaster, you slowly go up, and up, then suddenly, it all comes crashing down. This is how your emotions will be played with, you will learn to like each character, and you will learn to feel the strong emotions that come with each one of them.
Overall(9): The roller coaster has stopped, your seatbelt is unfastened and you slowly step out of the cart. As you step off, you look behind you and think to yourself ""What a ride that was, will I ever experience something so great in my life again?"" But sadly, the line to go again is extremely long, and you decide to come back another day. This line is the amount of time it will take for Japan to come out with another God-Tier anime. However long the line is, you know in the back of your head after watching what is Toradora!, that patience is a virtue, and if you wait long enough, dreams will come true. 
Thanks, if you have any questions please comment on my profile. This is a biased review, because it includes my opinions, do not take it as a viable source for information.",9
"
                Story: Yeah it is cliched, but many other anime settings are as well. The reason why I ranked it an 8 is that the way ToraDora plays with the story.
Art: Nothing extraordinary but the exaggerated facial expressions and actions really bring ToraDora to life.
Sound: Love the opening and the ending. It's pretty different from what I'm usually hearing but it has a tune and lyrics that really catch on. If I were to compare it to another opening that has the same attractiveness it would be Lucky Star. Yeah I said Lucky Star, may the angry mob read on before tearing me apart.
Character: This is
                  where I laughed my hardest. The cast of characters are a good mix that work well together. They are all heavily exaggerated along with their actions, but that's what pulls this anime to the top for me. Really, can you say no to Taiga's face when she's about to cry? Or perhaps the totally strange parrot bird thing Inko who makes you bust out laughing despite it's small screen time? Minori was also pretty epic in episode 5.  
Enjoyment: An anime that can balance the cute with the comedy this well makes it a ten for me. 
Overall: I probably should have given a 9 but the energy that the characters give off just makes me jump to a 10.
ToraDora is a must see for this season's anime. Even if you don't like romance, it has romance and comedy.",10
"
                I wasn't attracted to the show at the beginning like many others, but this show ends up really stirring up the memories of my own and making me feel quite related to the characters. 
I haven't cried for a show for a long time. Before this it was ""Honey and Clover II"" and ""Wolf Children"" that sincerely moved me.
My overall rating for the show is 8.5, somewhere between very good and great.
[Characters]
I'm not a super fan of any of the characters, but the anime did an excellent job making me like each one of them. The character development is pretty impressive. 
For example, I didn't
                  like Ami when she first appeared. She was really a double-dealing arrogant badass girl who took advantage of her pretty face to fool the people around her and couldn't face her true self. But later she became very considerate as well as savvy, knowing how to comfort people around her when the time is right. 
Minori seemed to be a simple optimistic girl at first glance, but she actually thinks deep and sincerely cares about her best friend Taiga. In fact, the jolly girl certainly has her breakdown too, especially when she loses her favorite people, but she eventually still faces the bitterness of life with her cheerfulness. 
Kitamura, as Taiga said, is really kind. He likes Taiga and was there for her when she needs help. But he fell in love with another girl, Kanou. It was surely a shock when he finds out that girl's gonna leave the country and study abroad. He lost himself once for that, but the people who loved him brought him back. 
The series really making almost everyone has a relatively full character. Many supporting characters left a deep impression on me as well, like Ya-chan and the class-teacher Yuri. Ya-chan raised up Ryuuji all by herself after the guy left her for another woman when she was pregnant. It broke my heart to see her telling that Ryuuji that his dad died in an accident and that she will protect him so it would be fine. Yuri isn't just another single class teacher who knows nothing but complains about being single. When the class was complaining about the change of location for their travel, Yuri wrote on the blackboard that ""Not everything in life goes smoothly!"" to shut them up. It was an interesting and effective move. Indeed, ""Not everything in life goes smoothly!"" That's how the stories of every character show. That's what makes the show a more realistic story. And That's what makes me feel connected. 
Back to the main characters, Taiga and Ryuuji. 
Taiga had a hard time to feel abandoned by her parents in her luxury apartment, had a hard time to see someone she loved to love someone else, had a hard time to try to let go of someone she love to someone he likes a lot, and had a hard time to face her true feelings too. She gave me the first impression of being violently defensive, but I later find her to be quite sensitive. Other tsundere features like blushing too much when facing the boy she loves probably are just part of fan services, which I do not wish to comment on.
The show doesn't have as much to depict how Ryuuji feels; it's more about what he does. It keeps me wondering what he thinks about Taiga and Minori. If Minori hadn't kept rejecting him from the beginning, would he keep thinking Taiga as a sister, and would it end differently? But I guess love has a lot to do with timing after all. 
[Story]
I've already talked a lot about the story when I talked about the characters: it helps develop the characters well and has a realistic touch. But I'd also like to add its downside. Although the development is good for a 25 episode show, but I don't think it's a perfect story. It has the cliche part and unrealistic part too. 
Many have complained it's almost evident from the beginning that Taiga and Ryuuji would be together. True. That they'd like to get married seems too sudden. It was balanced off by Taiga's leave without ruining a good ending by bringing Taiga back at finale, but it's still pretty unexpected in a not-so-good way to hear Ryuuji say that he wants to marry Taiga not long after he decides to switch his love interest from Minori to Taiga. 
The confession of love from Kitamura to Taiga at the very beginning feels like a duh. The reason of that is very lighthearted: there's a pretty girl in the class, and he wants to begin the high school life by finding a girlfriend. Really?
Ami in the first few episodes after her debut follows some pretty girl stereotype too much, although that impression was largely wiped out later.
[Sound]
Music works well. There's a soundtrack called ""Lost my pieces"" that was used often in emotional scenes. It contributes a lot to those scenes, but it's not something impressive if you hadn't watched the show and listened to it as a stand-alone. I like it a lot though.
[Enjoyment]
I start to take the show seriously after hearing Minori's talk about horror and ghost, and implicitly about love. I'm really moved and feel deeply related at episode 16, since it's similar to my own experience in many ways and it feels so real. After that, it was a wonderful experience to see the characters I mentioned before, Taiga, Ami, Minori, Kitamura, Ya-chan...to see them going through what they go through.

"
                Have you ever experienced an anime so much fun that you just can’t stop? This was basically my experience with Toradora . At first when I heard about it, Toradora seemed unappealing and a regular school comedy, but due to its high popularity, I decided to give it a try. I watched the first five episodes, and put it on hold because I didn’t want to get into lots of new anime at the time, but about a week after the last episode was released, I decided to get back into it, and before I knew it, I was about to enter the realm of
                  addiction.
Toradora starts off with the male lead, Ryuji Takasu, who is trying to make his best effort to make himself look good for his second term of high school. Despite his caring, gentle personality, his eyes resemble as of a dragon, which is why a lot of people are afraid of him and why Ryuji is called a delinquent throughout the whole school. Ryuji then starts off his first day, happy to know his best friend, Yusaku Kitamura, and the girl Ryuji has a crush, Minori Kushieda, are in the same class as him, But soon enough, Ryuji accidentally bumps into the most dangerous girl in school “The Palmtop Tiger”, Taiga Aisaka. Taiga usually has a negative attitude towards others, so after meeting Ryuji her first impression of Ryuji is that she really doesn’t like him. It also turns out that they end up being in the same class as well. Later that day after Ryuji is called up to the front of the school, he finds Taiga holding onto his school bag.  He then fights for it, and endsd up getting his bag. Later at night, Ryuji figures out that the bag belongs to Yusaku, and that Taiga slipped a love leter in his bag. Taiga ends up in Ryuji’s apartment to “kill” Ryuji after him finding out about the love letter. She was able to barge in because it so turns out she lives in the rich apartment next to Ryuji’s apartment. Ryuji is able to convince Taiga to not hurt him by saying that he likes Minori. Oh, and did I ever mention Taiga and Minori are best friends? So basically they team up so they can end up with each other’s best friend. Another character that is important to the story shows up around the fifth episode, Ami Kawashima, a model that is Yusaku’s childhood friend. Ami has a liking to Ryuji, and hatred towards Taiga, so basically Toradora is a love pentagon. Pretty weird, huh? Toradora stats off sounding plain, but in later episodes it brings more uniqueness to the story, having episodes involve, Taiga VS Ami in a 50 meter relay, Taiga’s family difficulties, Christmas, and a tragic field trip in my opinion that was unforgettable. Toradora has a really strong story, and the relationships between everybody are very strong, basically all of them close friends. 
Onto the OST and VA’s. The opening, which you’ve hard at the beginning of this review, is really spunky and has a Lucky Star quality to it. The second opening is very nice as well. Unfortunately, I can’t say for the ending themes, because they don’t give me the music quality I necessarily want. The soundtrack fits the mood throughout the series, and can be pretty calming at times. And the VA’s do an especially good job portraying each character, especially Rie Kugimiya, who has played such roles as Alphonse from Fullmetal Alchemist, Kagura from Gintama, Mizore Shirayuki from Rosario Vampire, and Shana as Shakugan no Shana. Throughout these aspects, you can tell she did a spot-on Taiga.
The art in my opinion is absolutely flawless. Maybe it’s because I watched the episodes in high quality, but it was shining and the colors were simply beautiful. The artwork shines throughout the series. I think this is probably one of Toradora’s high points.
Now the characters. The characters in Toradora are basically a hit-or-miss. There are characters in Toradora that are praised throughout the anime community, like Taiga, but some characters are neglected throughout the anime community, like Minori. I liked the characters, but for each character there was something missing between each one. Yusaku really got annoying after the last 10 episodes, Ami was a whiny bitch throughout the series in my opinion, and what really annoyed me is that characters that are basically extras throughout Toradora get rolled as “important characters”. But even so, I do believe that three of the main protagonists, Minori, Taiga, and Ryuji, are really good characters. Minori is very thoughtful of everyone around her, and is always putting her friends before herself. Ryuji is also thoughtful of everyone making their lives enjoyable, such as Taiga and his mother Yasuko. Taiga is perhaps the best tsundere I’ve witnessed throughout the anime community. She can be stubborn to people, but when she gets to know them more as friends, she can be very kind and thoughtful towards them, and, well, beating the crap out of people when they get in her way is pretty cool, too. So the characters have strong points and weak points towards them.
So overall, Toradora was a fun experience. Do you want to know how much I enjoyed it? 11 episodes in a row without stopping, making a new record for me. Toradora has a great plot, great character design, great music and VA’s, a nice set of characters, and a nice feeling after each episode. Toradora is a great experience that I think anyone could enjoy, so I recommend it to you, and my final rating is a 9.5 out of 10.",9
"
                I think we all need to take a step back and realize, what Toradora! has actually done for us. That is right, it has given us pretty much the definition of a good RomCom anime. Well, at least I've gotten that out of this show. Granted, I am not much of a romantic comedy advocate but I, being the cynical person I am, have to be quite impressed by a RomCom to even call it worth my interest. Even examples of good shows in this genre usually just set of my alarm clocks for BS I don't need to watch. But that is not the
                  case for Toradora! which  makes this pretty much the best anime of this genre I have watched to this day. 
The charakters' arcs are of solid pace, their motivations are pretty clear and while seeing a bit more development in the earlier episodes would have helped me to get more invested, I can assure you, that it reaches a nice conclusion in the end. But what is really surprising for a show of a genre that is otherwise drenched knee deep in cliché and annoying characters, is the multiple layers, almost every character has going for him or her. There is almost no one dimensional character in this cast, beside maybe the student council president, but her voice is sexy so I will let that slide just this once. They are all multi layered, interesting people with their own struggles and hobbies, that don't just exist to merely move the plot forward. While at first I was lead to believe that I didn't like the crush Taiga had on Kitamura for example, because I did not get, what she would see in him, I quickly came to the realization, that this was kind of intentional. 
Taiga and even Ryuuji had to slowly realize their own feelings and come to therms with themselves, rather than kissing awkwardly in the first episode and then freezing the plot for about ten others. That is the case for far too many of these kinds of shows but that and many other cliched tropes are far beneath Toradora! 
When you have to boil this review down to anything, it is this. Toradora! is above so many things in this genre, that even I, a person deeply drenched in cynicism and highly allergic to even the slightest bit of good intentions found this show to my liking. 
While still being above many of the more generic kinds of shows, it leaves many things to be desired though. But many of these problems are actually contributed to the genre itself and my personal taste, than to the show itself. It is no character study, no deeply cerebral piece of art, just something to warm my cold, frozen heart. 
There are no people acting like Uber Nutzoid Crazypants McGee, but rather tame and with that much more believable. But when you don't like RomComs even this will have a hard time convincing you. I caught myself at a weak moment liking this show, but it stuck and even now, after a while of letting it sink, I still like it. You will too, probably, maybe not, maybe you will hate it. The ending is predictable, but that is the point so there is, besides of lacking depth for certain characters, while for the most part still not being one dimensional, nothing else to fault the show for. A bit more depth to some of the cast would have been even better, but I still liked what I got. So will you love it or hate it? 
Only one way to find out, isn't there.",8

                I was thinking to write my first review on MAL when I got recommendations to watch this anime so I decided to make this.
Story: Well, when I saw MAL rating about this anime I actually had big hope, but when I watched the 1st episode I lost my hope. The plot is about a boy and a girl which in love with each other's best friend and that made them support each other and spent time like almost all day long. From what I saw, it's too obvious that the main characters are going to end up together, especially when Ryuuji and Taiga lives next
                  door and even almost like livin together. That's why I said it's too obvious they'll end up together, and when I saw a character has a crush on either Ryuuji or Taiga, this things always came to my mind ""it's impossible, you got no chance with your love""
Art: In this anime this part is really bad, especially Taiga, I was hoping she will be the cute character but it never happens. Taiga's fighting scene also really bad, or maybe it's just because I just finished action anime with an epic fighting scene.
Sound: I think the sound is not that bad if you really focus on the sound, but for me the music didn't impress me, maybe because I in clannad, just by hearing the themes I can remember the scene.
Overall I didn't enjoy this anime, my only motivation to finish this is because I don't want to make a review if I haven't finish the show.",3
"
                It's been a long time since I last gave a score of 10 to an anime. I started watching Toradora cuz I used up all the anime recommended to me, and ran outta options. To be honest, I stumbled upon Toradora many times in the past and I didn't give a damn about it cuz it looked kinda childish to me, but man, how WRONG I was. Never judge a book - anime in this case - by its cover, so to speak. Let's cut to the chase and start the review.
*the review doesn't contain any spoilers, major or minor* 
Story: 10/10
At first glance, you'd
                  say the story's unoriginal - highschool students who have a crush on their classmates with some comedy - a highschool romcom, in short - but it doesn't end here. I wasn't a big fan of romance cuz I've gone through many failed attempts to watch romance anime; they all turn out to be either extra mawkish, fatally boring, totally ridiculous or absolutely incoherent. Toradora is the first - and I fervently hope not the last - romance anime I watched that captivated me.
The narration itself is neither strictly linear nor episodic. Each episode is linked to the other in a smart, simple way, so once you start watching, you'll never stop.
The romance is the teasing type if you catch my drift; not the I-love-you-from-episode-one anime which almost always ends up exessively mushy, nor is it the save-a-damsel-in-distress type you find in Sword Art Online. It leaves you with that feeling when you smile by yourself like an idiot when you're thinking about someone you love, yes that one. I've had that expression on my face almost throughout the entire series.
As for the comedy, there's a lot of humor and funny moments. In fact, I'm not sure when I should laugh and when I shouldn't since the smile never leaves my face while watching the show.
It also has elements of slice of life. There's no fan service, thank God, and most importantly it ends right where it should. The ending's gonna leave you satisfied - no cliffhanger and wait-for-a-sequel crap. The bottom line, the story is epic.
Characters: 11/10
Here's where the anime shines the most. All of the characters are adorable, humorous and individually unique, especially the main ones. You can't hate anyone in the show, on the contrary. The relationship between the main characters is nice and enviable. All main characters are well developed and have their own unique personalities and stories, and you'll definitely relate and get attached to each one of them.
Animation: 10/10
The animation is superb. The characters are nice, cute and gorgeous. Their appearances very much match their personalities, and there's no stupid faces - except for the bird. Even the way the characters move, walk, laugh, everything is just awesome.
Sound: 9/10
I watched the English dubbed version. The characters have awesome voice-overs, absolutely flawless. They fit each other perfectly.
The music is nice, very suitable to the atmosphere. I liked the two opening themes, which I'd normally skip in most shows, but here I listened to them in every single episode. The only reason I'm giving it 9 out of ten is because the score's not so great to the extent that I'd add it to my tracklist, and listen to it day and night.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Oh, you're so gonna enjoy every single bit of the show, I guarantee it. Toradora is exciting in every aspect. You're gonna be engrossed in the show before you know it, time will go fast and the next thing you know, it's 5 a.m and I haven't gone to bed yet. Simply addictive. You'll get attached to the show so much so that you'll feel empty and depressed after it ends. I went on and watched the whole series all over again right after finishing it.
To sum it up, Toradora is a real masterpiece. You rarely get to see a romance anime without ridiculous humor, over-sentimental, mushy characters and a plague in anime called fan service. My view of the romance genre underwent a 180° change after watching this show. I'm gonna look for another anime like this one right after I post the review. I highly advise everyone to watch the show. It's meant for both teenage and mature audiences, so enjoy it.",10

                Toradora Review (for those not bothered by spoilers or who want to compare with me)
	I have recently watched an anime called Toradora. It was literally an anime about finding love. The anime starts off strong showing us our two main protagonists Taiga and Ryuji. The start of with a little epilogue where they are talking about something you can’t see (love) and that if anyone found it everyone would want it. I have to admit that the only reason I even watched this anime was because I was trying to find some closure from another anime I watched recently, so this review may be biased
                  and it does contain spoiler ( MAJOR). I eally couldnt find a way to review this without breaking it down piece for piee as this wil also o on my youtube.
	The show starts off good and strong showing that our main character Ryuji apparently looks scary and everyone is afraid of him (for the time being at least). It starts off with some guys running into him and after seeing his face they give him their lunch money, after which he returns it to the lost and found. Our main protagonist Ryuji has two main friends at this point, a Yusaku and Minori. These two pop up within the first fifteen minutes of the show and are pretty well thought out throughout the anime. After their introduction a girl named Taiga comes into the mix, she is a petite Lolita class character that seems to be in love with Yusaku.
	Now on with the plot, I will try to make this short and sweet for you so as not to give too much away. Ryuji find out that Taiga likes Yusaku, and Taiga finds out Ryuji likes Minori. They decide to work together to try and hook each other up with the ones they like. The thing is, Taiga lives alone and her lifestyle is not a healthy one, so Ryuji starts to take care of Taiga (with his mother’s blessing of course) and everyone gets the wrong idea. Taiga is a character that I would call #2Tsun4Me as in she is Tsundere to the core. Taiga being Tsundere she cannot be honest with herself. Rumors start flying around that they are dating because they are always together and Taiga takes it into her own hands to clear them and Ryuji’s name as well. So Ryuji’s name is cleared, nobody thinks they are dating anymore, and Taiga confesses to Yusaku. Character development incoming, he rejects Taiga (and for good cause) and she is heartbroken. Ryuji was listening the whole time and we get a little (I forot the actual term sadly) “spoiler” when Ryuji says something, but I won’t go into detail here.
	Now spinning away from the story a little bit, I don’t like how much the anime skips although it makes sense after finishing it. So much days even weeks are skipped in the first few episodes. So in those episodes they are just doing character development for Taiga, Ryuji, and even a little for Minori. We find out that Ryuji is a crazy neat freak. Taiga is actually a little darling. And Minori is a crazy hard worker that seems to have gone through some tough times, which she has but again not going to go into that this early on.
	Now we fast forward to where the plot starts to thicken. A new character going by the name Ami comes into the mix. She is a model for a magazine that for some reason moves into their neighborhood and into their school. I am going to summarize this arc because it isn’t too important for character development. Long story short, she moved there because she had a stalker. Ami has a problem with her personality. She acts all nice and cute but is really a mean person (though I admit it starts to turn softer and nicer towards the end). Ryuji helps her to overcome her stalker fear and assures her that her personality is what makes her herself and she should stop acting childish about it (this actually comes into play. BIGTIME). But for now all we know is that she seems to like him.
	Next is a little swimming contest that Taiga and Ami have to fight over Ryuji, Taiga loses because she can only kick and she goes to save Ryuji. We actually get a little taste of her true feelings (sorry I spoiled it a little, but it was so obvious and I need to put it in here) as she yells that he is hers. Again in this arc plot thickens as Ryuji tries to confess  to Minori  and we get a little mixed response, we don’t know if she knows what he is talking about or not, but her answer is vague. We see that Taiga and Ami are starting to get closer (and it thickens as time goes on) even if they still tease each other.
	Now we will fast forward a bit into the future, Taiga’s father has returned and we sort of want what Ryuji wants. He wants her to make up with her father (I have some sympathy with his character as my father was never around either). Ryuji does not listen to Taiga and what she thinks is best. So he sort of forces it on her to make her think it is her responsibility to make up with her father again. Minori is against this and ends up fighting Ryuji over it. Long story short things don’t pan out and Ryuji tries his hardest to make up for it. 
	Ryuji and Taiga are starting to realize their feelings for one another but can’t come to grips with it. Ryuji has been caring for Taiga all this time and they keep getting closer. Taiga herself is being cared for and is starting to get used to Ryuji’s family life. Come Christmas time the whole class is attempting to throw a Christmas party. A lot of crap happens but instead of waiting for Minori, Ryuji rushes over to where Taiga is to cheer her up (again, we see his feelings, but he does not realize them himself). After leaving Taiga to go back to the party to see Minori Taiga runs after him and screams his name, Minori is off to the side.
	At the school Minori pretty much “straight arms” Ryuji and denies his confession. This is where we see that Minori wasn’t being honest either and is in love with Ryuji. Now we fast forward a bit more to where Yusaku is starting his temper tantrum stage. A lot happens, Yusaku is really in love with someone else. Taiga attacks the girl for not being straight-forward. Then everything seems fine for a bit. During the Valentines arc is where the story is starting to reach its climax (which is also pretty much the end).
	I actually skipped a huge part where Taiga unknowingly confesses to Ryuji during a winter trip accident. In this stage Taiga skips school to hang out with  her mom but our protagonists know nothing about it and Ryuji actually throws a fit over it (again showing his true feelings). But away from that tangent, Ryuji and Taiga are covering Ryuji’s mom on her job. After Minori confronts Ryuji and Yusaku for lying about who saved Taiga, a lot of drama ensues and you can see that the anime is finally reaching its end and things are finally getting good. It is the typical high school drama and I have to admit it was pretty awesome.
	After this confrontation though, another one follows with Taiga and Ryuji’s moms. They finally confess to one another their true feelings and we have this huge bit with Ryuji’s mom finally coming to terms with her parents. It does have a happy ending, albeit a cliché one.
	So for my final grade or ranking of this anime, I would have to say it is a solid 7/10. The anime was good, but the start is what got me. If it didn’t skip around so much it would probably be an 8/10. The character development was also a letdown. Sure we as the audience already knew what was going to happen, but I still feel like it could have done better. The end also seemed to be a bit rushed. I would have loved to have seen more drama. After the first fight everyone just seemed to come to terms with everything and just up and went out of their ways to help out. It seriously felt like the last few episodes could have dragged on a little longer than it did. I would have liked to hear more from Ryuji’s grandparents. We find out his dad didn’t really die, and I would have loved some closure on that topic. I am not even going to mention the wedding as I would have loved to have seen one, but seeing how they were rushing the last few episodes, I guess we didn’t really need one.
	So this is my review, I would recommend this anime to those looking for a “slice of life”, comedy, romance hybrid.

                Toradora is not just a romantic comedy or a comedic romance; it is both a comedy and a romance. If Toradora was simply either a romance or a comedy, I reckon it would still be pretty darn good. And that is how good i find Toradora to be.
P.S- sorry but this review is kinda long so...
Story: 10/10
The story revolves primarioy around Taiga and Ryuji. Ryuji loves Taiga's best friend and Taiga love Ryuji's best friend. And so they decide to help each other in their quest to attain the love of those who they each love. Simple right? Nope. Taiga can be described using most,
                  if not all of the following words; psychotic, dangerous, insane, selfish, demanding, and brutal, despite her extremely small stature (she's only 5 foot 5 inches tall!!). On the other hand Ryuji is a kind, gentle, and caring boy whose eyes resemble those of someone who wants to hurt you and who has  a compulsive desire for everything to be orderly and hygienic. If the joining of two such personalities in the same quest of love isn't enough for you to be interested, then keep reading. Otherwise, go watch the first episode and I swear you will not be disappointed.
The first episode of Toradora is one of my favourite, if not my favourite, first episodes of any anime I've watched. It does an extremely good job of introducing your two main characters and it does so in a pretty hilarious fashion. But what I like most about this anime is that the quality of episode never really declines at all after the first one. The quality stays at a consistently high level throughout the entire anime. Eventually you meet all the other characters such as Taiga's love Yuusaku, Ryuji's love Minori, the fake face bitch Ami, and the assortment of other interesting and funny supporting characters.
What I love so much about this story is that nothing exciting really ever happens in the lives of these students compared to other anime I have watched. Toradora uses seemingly simple everyday tasks and happenings to develop each character and their respective relationships with the other characters extremely well. However, having said that, each of the main characters aside from Ryuji have their own mini story arcs, whereby each character gets a little bit more screen time than they usually do. Unlike other anime I have seen like Kanon or Clannad, each arc doesn't place a complete focus on a single character but instead includes all the other characters. On top of that each arc contributes heavily to the overall story and it makes for a much more memorable watching experience.
Now there are only two real small problems that I have with this anime and honestly, they are are really small problems so they night not affect your watching experience.
First of all, I may just sound like I'm cocky but after I had finished the first episode, I knew what the outcome of the anime would be. However having said that, I would like to quote one of the Earth Kingdom nomad performers from Avatar: The Last Airbender; ""going to a destination is not about the destination but rather about the going"". I've been waiting to apply this quote to an anime for a long time and I finally got my chance. I knew what the outcome was going to be but it in no way lowered the quality of my watching expereince. Despite knowing what was going to happen, I still loved every moment and every scene this anime had to offer me. And even when the anime had reached its brilliant conclusion, one of which I had already known, I could not prepare myself for the emotions I felt in the final episode. However, having said that, I have to say that the anime did an earn extremely good job of convincing me that the outcome I had predicted was not going to be the case and at times during the anime, my confidence in the outcome I had predicted waned quite a bit, almost to the point where I completely scrapped my idea of what was going to happen.
Secondly, *this is about the ending and despite the fact there are no spoilers I understand some people may not want to know anything about the ending so please skip this paragraph if you are on of these people* the final five or so minutes of the anime completely ripped my heart out and went on to mend it extremely quickly. After finishing Toradora, I just felt like too much was packed into the final few minutes. Despite, brilliant and emotion-evoking dialogue, I feel as though the final five minutes would've been better should there have been extra episode. Five minutes to rip out my heart and mend it just didn't seem like enough to satisfy me.
Characters - 9/10
I've already touched on the characters in the story category so I will be a bit more brief here. Every single character in this anime was unique and likeable, at least in my opinion. I've already described Taiga to you and honestly, she is the selling point for the show in the first few episodes. If you don't like girls with personalities like Taiga's, then you may not like this anime or the first few episodes may be a bit rough for you. However, as previously mentioned, I said that the character development and the development of their relationships is done extremely well in Toradora. This is particularly evident with Taiga. As the story begins to uncover the softer side of her personality and reveal more about her past, you start to see a Taiga that you may be more accustomed to.
My single flaw with the characters in this anime is Ami. I may have previously said that each character is developed extremely well and Ami is no exception. However, her screen time decreases quite a bit as the anime progresses and this disappoints me quite a bit. As a result her character development becomes stunted and she is reduced to the role of ""observer"" and occasionally she gets a few lines here and there; however many of these lines often go unheard by other characters and the final scene in which she says anything meaningful and worth contributing to the story is cut short and ultimately had no impact on me.
Art: 10/10
The art in Toradora is nothing too special... when it doesn't want to be. However, when the anime wants to display a beautiful sunset, a wintry night, or a Christmas tree that is the life of the party, this anime can be extremely beautiful.
Sound: 10/10
Don't even get started on the OSTs in Toradora. They are brilliant. The openings and closings are catchy and I honestly really like them. Toradora'so closings are some of the few closing that I ever bothered to watch more than once because I just really liked them. There is also the Christmas song performed by Taiga and Ami which I loved despite only having listened to it once.
As for background music, it does an absolutely splendid job of amplifying the moods and emotions associated with their respective scenes. I have to give special mention to the OST or OSTs which started before a comedic moment. As soon as they we started I would always have a big grin on my face, ready to start laughing when the moment came and I feel as though this had a huge impact on the fact that I actually found Toradora absolutely hilarious. Similarly, the OSTs during sad moments also amplified the feels that I felt, particularly one which I cannot really pinpoint, otherwise I would need to spoil one of the anime's greater moments. It nearly made me cry listening to it outside of the anime.
The voice acting in the dub version (which is what I watch so deal with it) was brilliant. Taiga was nailed perfectly in my opinion, especially given the fact that her character must be an absolute handful to voice act. I also want to mention Ami's voice actor who was able to switch between bitch Ami and nice Ami extremely smoothly, and Minori's voice actor who gave so much life to a character who's ideals and beliefs are bigger than life itself. There isn't much I can really say about the other voice actors. They did fine jobs in their respective roles and none of the characters ever felt bland or out of place due to their voice acting.
Enjoyment: 11/10 (rounded down to 10/10)
I've never been much of a romance or comedy type of guy, opting instead for action and adventure. But Toradora captured my imagination and my heart only a few episodes into the series, landing it a place on my top 5 favourite anime of all time, possibly even my favourite. It was a viewing experience of the highest quality and I storngly, strongly, strongly recommend this anime to just about anyone, whether they are a fan of romance and comedy or not.
I hope I helped you make a decision in whether you want to watch Toradora or not. Feedback is much appreciated!
Edits: The name of the Christmas song is Holy Night and the sad song is Lost My Pieces should you want to check them out before starting the anime.",10

                ""There are things in this world that no one has seen.

This a story school life story about a boy meet girl only with a twist. the boy has a friend which the girl likes and the girl has a friend which the boy likes, thus beginning a heartwarming epic about the lives of the boy and girl and everyone around them.
Often times people are misunderstood
                  and get bad first impressions but for those who are willing to see through those misunderstandings await rewards that may be incomparable to anything else in the world. This is a main driving point for the story which will tie into the very first and last lines of this anime and after watching will leave u touched in ways your average animes cannot.
Ryuuji Takasu, an intimidating looking boy in love with Minori and whose best friend is Aisaka Taiga a short but vicious girl finds out that Taiga likes his best friend Kitamura and after a midnight assassination attempt by Taiga, works together so that their loves can be fulfilled. As the story progresses not only do they not get any progress, but they begin to realize their feelings for each other as they spent most of their time together.
Plot development and character development is ongoing and through the course of these 25 seemingly short episodes, you will find that there is absolutely no fillers and that the characters are unique, funny, and heartwarming to watch. Everyone in a sense will get their mini arcs which consist of an episode or two but the main focus as you will notice is how the feelings for Taiga change over the course of the anime. As the story progresses, you will become attached to all the characters with feelings for everyone of them for all these characters are far from being recycled material.
Plots and characters aside, Toradora also has a very catchy and addictive opening and ending tracks which are inserted perfectly to provide transitions into the start of an episode as well as transitioning into the end. Because of this, episode intros and endings are not abrupt which contributes into the overall enjoyment as well as leaving you wanting more (especially if you were watching it when it was being released weekly).
If you managed to read this far and asked yourself, ""do i want to watch this?"" my reply is that you most likely do. This story is not all about romance since it deals with family situations and that not everyone is content in life. To be more in depth, this is a more realistic romance story even if its  superficial at some points, but overall is an anime you cannot put down once you start.",9
"
                Starting Toradora was kinda interesting for me, the main reason why I picked it up was that I was told through a friend that it's one of the best (if not the best) anime in its type of genre. Curious on that claim, I decided to give it a shot to see if it met my expectations.
The story itself is pretty simple and basic, taiga loves ryuuji's best friend, and vice versa for ryuuji to taiga's best friend. Both decide to help each other out in following their love's path set out for them. As the show goes on though, it becomes less about trying
                  to get together with who they love, and more about understanding why they love, who they really love, what love really is. I won't lie, it's probably a really predictable story on how it ends since it certainly won't shock anyone by the ending, but the show is not about the ending; it's about the progression to that ending.
I think what stuck out to me most about toradora was its characters, and I don't mean just the main ones of taiga and ryuuji. I mean pretty much the whole cast of characters are incredibly dynamic, they change over the course of the show, learn, grow with the viewer. Even characters like the homeroom teacher and class president who don't get anywhere near as much screen time as most of the cast really do learn and evolve into better people. The character interactions are quite amazing and beautifully woven together to really show how the characters grow from each other. Nothing feels forced or nonsensical; every characters actions and emotions feels very real and relatable. For such a simple story, it really is fleshed out marvelously by these extremely dynamic characters, and really makes the viewer feel at home and engaged from beginning to end.
Toradora is definitely a show that met my expectations and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the genre it tops at. Extremely lovable and relatable characters that make a basic story turn into a highly enjoyable experience from beginning to end will make you wish the show doesn't end when it does. It's a show that more likely than not will grow on me as time goes on, maybe becoming my favorite anime of all time.",9

                ""If you trip while running down a hallway, you’ll get a nosebleed. If you trip in life, you cry.""
After about 6 months of hearing all the constant chatter about how amazing Toradora! is, I  decide to watch it. I've seen quite a few of RomComs, such as Lovely Complex and Zero no Tsukaima, and I've been a fan of them for a while. The only problem with RomComs these days is that they either suck, or they have an unoriginal story to it. Very rarely do I find a RomCom now a days that deserves anything above an 8, and I was actually really
                  happy once I started watching Toradora, 'cause this is one of the rare RomComs I was just talking about. I don't know what made me love it the most, but I can definitely say that this inparticular RomCom is one of my most favorites of all time.
To start off, I'll give you a brief idea about what the story is about. We have Takasu and Taiga, who are both known in the school as ""Dragon and Tiger"". It start's off pretty normally, Takasu has a crush on Minori, the friend of Taiga, and Taiga has a crush on Kitamura, the friend of Takasu. Once Takasu and Taiga find out they've been living right next door to eachother, they decide to help eachother out by trying to set eachother up with their friends. With that, there are many moments full of laughter, romance, heartbreak, and plain old fun. It may sound like a cliché storyline, but the way they made this anime makes it the opposite of a cliché. I was satisfied for most of the show, despite the ending being the slightest bit anti-climactic. Overall, the story was very well made, and the comedy thrown into it makes Toradora definitely worth watching.
Artwork was great. I liked how the characters were portrayed, their looks seem to fit their personalities, at least except for Takasu. You don't see many tall, scary looking guys who are obsessed with cleaning and cooking. Taiga's character was probably my favorite in terms of appearance. The fact that she can kick ass at 4'7"" is amazing. Other than her shortness, she brings this kid-like cuteness mixed in with a sexy-like cuteness... she definitely gave off some weird vibes, but I didn't care, I still loved her.
Rie Kugimiya, the goddess of Tsundere voice-acting roles! Voiced the best character in Toradora (Taiga again)! Her and her professionalism made Taiga practically perfect, and she has an amazing voice when it comes to singing as well, good Lord. Junji Majima rocked Takusu's voice as well. His calm-like personality made Takasu even more funny during comedic situations. Everyone else practically nailed their roles, the voice acting was grade A.
Taiga. Taiga is still my favorite. She made it on my ""Top 10 Female Anime Characters"" list. I don't know whether it's because I'm a fan of Tsunderes, or because she's just plain lovable, but she was my favorite character in Toradora. Her personality made it even easier for me to love her, and I'd be surprised if there were any Taiga-Haters out there, because if there were, I'd need to go slap some sense into them. Takasu was really cool, he made it onto my ""Top 10 Male Anime Characters"" list... in otherwords, there were quite a few nominees in this anime that could have made it onto my list. Takasu is like the ideal partner. Ladies who can't cook or clean, here you go, Takasu is your man. Next theirs Minori. Hyperactive and funny, but at the same time, I kept getting mad at her at some points. There wasn't anything I hated about her, it's just some moments in this anime that made me think I did. Once you watch, you'll understand. Next there's the Chihuahua (Kawashima). Snobby model/actress personality made her seem like the villain of the show. Luckily she wasn't. She actually proved herself to be one of the most reliable characters on the show, helping people with their love life and such. Finally, there's the God of Unrequited Love (AKA Kitamura). When I heard that nickname I thought, ""What the hell?"". Other then that, he seemed like a funny guy, but I did question his stripping habits in a few of the episodes. But he's the ideal best friend. Overall characters in this show were all awesome!
Enjoyed every minute of every enjoyable second. Got sad every minute of every sad second. Laughed every minute of every funny moment. This is your ideal RomCom (God, so many ""Ideals"" in this...). If you're looking for good comedy, romance, and enjoyableness... enjoyability... wait, what... anyways, look no further, Toradora is the anime for you. I recommend this to everyone, even if you don't like RomComs and are more of the action/sci-fi/thriller/whatever genre that isn't Romance or Comedy type, watch this. It'll be well worth it, I assure you.",10
"
                      Toradora....where do i begin. This show is easily the best anime show I've seen in a long time, and that's saying something. Everything about it is everything i like in a good romance. The story begins with Ryuuji and Taiga first meeting. let me explain them first. 
     Taiga is a rough and tuff girl who wont take and crap from anybody, she is however small so this being the fact she is called the palmtop tiger, it is also later shown that her agressiveness is due to a rough childhood.  Ryuuji on the other hand is quite a soft, though everyone is afraid of him because he resembles his dad (who I think he was supposed to be like a realy bag guy, they didn't go much in depth in that area) he is very nice, and unlike Taiga is actually kind of a pushover. Anyway back to what i was saying
     Taiga is caught by Ryuuji trying to put a love letter to kitamura in his bag, but ends up putting it in Ryuuji's bag. Ryuuji finds it and is tempted to read it, but he resists. Then Taiga rages in and attacks Ryuuji with a wooden sword. Once things have calmed down Ryuuji tells Taiga about the poems and what not he writes for Minorin. seeing that they each have simialar goals, and the fact that their love interest is the other best friend. They decide to work together and help each other in getting that person. However it is not very smooth sailing
      Taiga is very timid around kitamura so she never can really push herself to do anything that Ryuuji plans out for her. she can barely say a word to him at the beginning of the show but towards the end she is more open with him. This I think is due to the fact that she is realising that she likes Ryuuji instead, this however doesn't happen till near the end.
      Ryuuji is not near as timid around Minorin as Taiga is with kitamura, but he still mumbles his words now and then. He as well has issues with pushing himself to do what Taiga plans out for him. Toward the very end it is revealed that Minorin actually does like Ryuuji.
      Taiga and Ryuuji spend alot of time together because of the fact that Taiga lives alone. Ryuuji cooks for her just about every night. Because of this Ryuuji's mother considers Taiga part of the family.
      Later on as Taiga and Ryuuji spend more time together, (though they never say till the very end) they end up having feelings for each other. It does take a while for them to realise it, so sit tight and keep watching. because it is worth it.
      one of the best traits about Toradora is it's suspense. I don't know how they were able to put so much suspense in a drama/romance but they did. For me this show left me wondering after every episode. It made me think and want to know what was in the next episode. I had to seriously force myself away from the computer in order to stop watching it. Because after every episode you WILL want to know what happens next!!! I gaurantee it.
      Another thing about Toradora. I know in retrospect it is pretty obvious that Taiga and Ryuuji will be together, and I thought that would ruin it for me...but...it really didn't. Because though it may be obvious, it doesn't really seem sensible. It doesn't seem like they'll end up together at the beginning even though you know they will. It's crazy how this show does it but it does it excellently.
      I would recommend this show to anyone who likes drama/romance cause this show does both of those PERFECTLY!! and i don't say that lightly. The background's on the character and the storyline would have made the show good even if there was no romance. I would highly recommend this anime.
      Story (8) - I am giving this story an 8. Because though it did have interest, and left you wanting to know what happened. It is lacking in resolve. considering Taiga's family that is. At the end of the show Taiga's family is still mad at her for leaving, and they don't really resolve that. Though she does end up going back for a year.
      Art (9) - I give this show a high 9 on art. The design of the character's wasn't my favorite design, but the show still made it work out. The art was masterful in my opinion. The work of a genius.
      Sound (10) - I am giving the sound a 10 for various reasons. The emotion in this show could be felt throughout every episode. It was like you could almost feel the person's pain. even when the side character had a moment it was great. The sound is really Toradora's shining moment.
      Character (9) - I am giving character's a 9. This is the kind of show that you will definitely like all of the characters. Even if you didn't like a character from the start (for me it was Minorin) you will like them towards the end. The backgrounds on all of them are all unique and all interesting. No one's background in this show is boring.
      Enjoyment (10) - I have never watched a show that I have enjoyed more than Toradora. As i said before it will leave you in suspense after every episode. it will be 4 am in the morning and you will be finishing episode 17. It will end and you will lie their with your mouth open. Then you will scream because you want to go to bed but you don't want to stop watching it (WARNING!! if you don't like staying up really late than i would sudgest not watching Toradora at night.)
      Overall (10) - as for the overall it obviously get's a 10. Which are well earned points. This story will not dissappoint you if you like drama/romance that leave you suspenseful and wondering. Not to mention really excited at some points. P.S. Ryuuji and Taiga do kiss at the last episode. =)",10
"
                Keeping a story interesting through a 25 episode series is a hard thing to do and you must always make sure that your not too repetitive with the stories. This anime does a great job in doing this and i never thought I'd enjoy it. I first saw this anime on a top 10 romance video and it took me 6 months to actually get around to it because i don't like romance between a short and a tall character. Before i watched the anime i didn't even have an open mind, i was 75% sure i was going to hate it and i have
                  got to say that this anime was unexpectedly enjoyable. I loved the concept of the tiger and the dragon and how they were the perfect match for each other. I just loved both of their relationship throughout the series. Every time their friends would face a conflict and i was interested in almost all of their stories. I also liked how unique of a male character Ryuuji was. Some of Ryuuji's qualities were adapted from other regular main characters but most of them were quite unique. This might sound great and all but their was a bit of failure when it came to Ami's character. Ami caught my attention at first but after a while her story kinda grew old and she never really solved her problem. I never even understood what she was thinking. Her character was confusing and it hurt my head a little. The next issue is more of a personal taste rather than an issue. Tragic romance has always made me cry and i never really had a problem with it but the ending was really something i didn't get. Yeah i get that love is confusing and all but if Tiga's Decision still baffles me to this moment. If she had died or was forced to move i would have understood but her decision was like taking a poo on all the build up and hard work. Over all i think that this anime was very good and i hope that it was definitely a must watch anime",8
"
                Toradora is a lovely and funny anime with curious characters and a beautiful story. Its name is based in a relationship with the Tiger (Aisaka Taiga) and Dragon (Takasu Ryuji). It's easy to know how the story will end, but there is all a so much interesting plot behind this. Check it out!
In begining, you're introduced to Ryuji, the Dragon. He is a cold fish, very intimidating and mysterious for the most of people, but, in truth, he is a nice guy, smart and gentle with everyone who wants come close to him. Kitamura Yusaku is one of this people and a very clever and
                  dedicated member of the student council. He is Ryuji's best friend and Taiga's crush. Yeah, Taiga is fallen in love with him and fails miserably with her mission to send him a love card, making her enter in a peculiar situation with Ryuji, when she discovers that he's in love with her best friend, Kushieda Minori. Taiga is in love with Ryuji's best friend and Ryuji is in love with Taiga's best friend... Let's make a deal! Ryuji only imagined that it could be more easy and less exhausting, haha!
My favorite character is, with no doubt, Minori. She is so cute and adorable and charming and funny and... Aaah!!! She is perfect, hahaha!
Kawashima Ami appears a little bit late, but she's an awesome girl too, she is the truest of them all. (That's so paradoxal!) With a so much common charm, she is a gem and deserves a spotlight here.
Yusaku also is a character full of highlights, as your responsability sense and enthusiasm. He's cute, no?
But, can I be honest with you? The protagonists broke me down a little. Taiga is called by Palmtop Tiger, so you can wait a girl with much fisical strong and little mental maturity. And Ryuji accepts her rough treatment like a dog. (Jokes for after, please, rs.)
So, my grade for them is 7, my average.
Although Toradora be a 2008 production, there is an excellent work with the art and sound. The music are catchy, the characters and scenarios much well drawed, there is so much beautiful effects and the openings are simply perfects! My grade could be 10 so much easy, but the ending songs make no sense.
Yeah, it's weird. Really.
My enjoyment wasn't so high and I don't know if I'm too older for this or if for another reason. Anyway, I see Toradora as a good distraction and it has an fair enjoyment, like the grade 6 sugests.
So, overall, my grade is 7. If you are a fan of shoujos and romance, it's an anime that will not disappoint you and if you aren't, it will surprise you! Take a good look in Toradora and I hope I helped you.",7
"
                I don't know. I personally did not feel attached at all to this series. I don't get it why a lot of people are praising this as one of the best romance anime out there. Maybe nostalgia hits? Did not like the girl anyway since she's so frustrating to watch. Not hating on her though but its just that the way things happened were like so out of place. Story wise is okay-ish and the development was lacking for me. The ending was pretty bad for me. How could they think of doing things like that??? Middle High School kids be doing that? Come on
                  now.",1
"
                So this is my first review on here. I'm new to this so don't judge.
Toradora wasn't really what I was expecting it to be. Not in a good way but not in a bad way either. I thought there would be more romance in this anime but there wasn't any romance until the last few episodes. I was disappointed that there wansn't much romance. I still enjoyed the anime though but it's not one of my favorites.
Story: 7/10
I liked the whole idea of two people trying to help each other get with the one they love or have a crush on but than instead falling
                  for each other. But the anime would get boring at certain points. But i did like how they mixed comedy and drama together. I give it a 7/10 though because like I said it was just to boring for me at certain times.
Art: 8/10
I really loved the art and I loved all the bright colors in the anime. The art would look weird sometimes though. Now I'm not going to say why because it would be a spoiler. But I really did like the art.
Sound 8/10
I think this is referring to music? Well If it is... I loved the soundtrack. Especially when a sad scene would come on there would be that touching music that would make you cry. I almost cried as a matter of fact while that music was on. I didn't really like one or two background pieces though.
Characters: 9/10
The characters were amazing! My favorite character was definitely Taiga. She's the best character in the show in my opinion. All of the other characters were great to though and I instantly fell in love with them.
Enjoyment:7/10
As I said before the anime would get boring I'm certain episodes. But there were some episodes that had me hooked and I had to watch the next episode after watching certain ones
Overall: 7/10
The anime was good overall. The only reason I gave it a 7/10 is because there wasn't much romance and it would get boring at creating points. Anyway that's my review.",8
"
                Aka: TigerxDragon ""The dragon has been the only beast to equal the taiga""
tl;dr at bottom.
Story: 8
The story is a little slow when compared to other anime series due to the similar setting and events of the plot. However, it picks up at later episodes and if you can endure up to then, it is well worth the watch. 
Art: 8
I was sceptical at first at the way the characters looked which was something I was not used to. However, after a couple of episodes, you really do get use to it and it becomes enjoyable to watch. It has good details and is worth the
                  watch.
Sound: 8
Like your typical anime, the voice acting and sounds were spot on and well expressed with emotions that will move you.
Character: 9
Many people dislike the character of Taiga for her abusiveness towards our beloved Ryuuji as well as most characters in the series, but personally I loved her character. The relationship between Taiga and Ryuuji felt real and the series does well in showing the viewer their relationship throughout even when you're told otherwise. Minor characters which seem to only be there for the sake of it eventually comes into the picture and we suddenly notice them as having a role in the series rather than just another mise en scene. The characters are funny in their own way and provide the viewers with laughter at certain point which is a bonus in my book.
Enjoyment: 8
Having waited almost the entire series for the characters to finally express themselves, it felt a bit abrupt in the way the series ending. I personally think that the ending could've being more satisfying if they had showed a bit of the after story. But nonetheless, it was enjoyable.
OVERALL: 8
I would definitely recommend this anime to those hardcore high school romance fans because it takes a little endurance to get through. But it is definitely rewarding. I often say a good anime is any anime that can still evoke emotions in you after you have long watched it because it shows that it has impacted you in some way and you have taken something from it.
TL;DR : Definitely recommend to romance series lovers. The plot is a little slow but it is rewarding to finish. Characters are easy to relate to and provide much needed humour and emotions. Watch it!",8
"
                Just so you know I read the light novels (10 volumes), so I have more or less a point of comparison and reference.
Let me tell you how good it is. First 2 episodes ended me up watching the whole series in 2 sittings (12 or 13 eps/day, which is very abnormal IMO) and ended up rewatching 2 more times and reading the novel in a span of 2months.
Toradora. Most people have no idea what the title means. Neither did I when I saw this the first time. I assumed it was some typical rom-com story of unrequited love. And yes, it's exactly like that in
                  the first episodes. 
However, as the story and characters began to develop, it presents something deeper than just simple romance. Cherishing friendship, staying  in ""comfort zones,"" letting go, et cetera. It doesn't focus on the shallow side of romance. And that's what sets it apart from other anime of same genre.
One very strong point: character development.
One weakness: it was rushed towards the end. The anime somewhat drifted from the novel in around ep 22+ (i think). So I recommend reading the novel at least from V7 onwards (better if you read from the start, of course).
Nevertheless, the anime is very very good and is recommended to everyone.",10
"
                I came into Toradora! excited. I heard so much hype for it over the years and I’m a huge fan of tsundere characters of which Taiga is the poster child. So, why not? 
However, from the very first episode I could tell: Toradora! isn’t really anything special. Perhaps the series was groundbreaking when it was first released, but I failed to see what was so amazing about it. Sure, I had a few chuckles here and there, and certain scenes (ski-trip incident, Taiga’s mental breakdown about losing Ryuuji, and a few others) were pretty great, but I definitely wouldn’t consider this anime a masterpiece. 
Now,
                  I may sound like I’m just trash-talking this series, but there were some pretty decent points, too. I’ll go through each category one by one and explain both the positives and negatives I found.
Story: 
5.5/10 — Ryuuji Takasu, a 2nd year high-school student who is often feared for his scary-looking face, meets Taiga Aisaka— the school’s most feared girl. After discovering that Taiga has a crush on his best friend (Kitamura) and that he has a crush on hers (Minori), the two join forces in an attempt to play matchmaker for one another. The story follows their attempts at getting their friends to fall for each other, but in the end, it’s Ryuuji and Taiga that end up getting together. 
Let’s face it, Toradora! had a very basic storyline. While I admit the plot of having the MCs play matchmaker was new, the majority of Toradora! was your basic slice-of-life/high school storyline. I enjoyed the class trip, the pool “arc” and other typical high school activities since I’m a fan of the slice of life genre, but what bothered me was the overall pacing of the story. There were far too many episodes and not enough entertaining content to fill them. Certain problems were drawn out unnecessarily (i.e.: Ryuuji trying to confess to Minori) that dampened the show to boring at times. Other times (particularly the first episode) the scenes cut through quickly and weren’t even given proper conclusions. One example of this was in the first half of episode 1 when Ryuuji literally bumps into Taiga for the first time. Taking offense, Taiga punches him. 
…And that’s it. 
Ryuuji moves on as if getting punched in the face is an everyday occurrence. It doesn’t show him angered, saddened, even bothered by the fact that he got socked in the face for no apparent reason by a stranger. He just rolls with it, because, hey, why not? On top of that, the next time he meets with her, he has nothing to say about being punched. He doesn’t confront her or complain about it. He has no reaction; he just moves on. Normal humans don't do that. 
Skipping ahead, I also find it worthy to add my feelings about Ryuuji and Taiga as a couple. Though I understand the build-up for Taiga's feelings toward Ryuuji, I can't quite understand why Ryuuji liked Taiga in return. The anime made it seem as if, once he figured out Taiga had feelings for him, he decided to like her, too, just because. Taiga falling in love with Ryuuji made sense because he was a generally kind person that helped her through thick and thin. In fact, the majority of the series is spent with Ryuuji trying to help Taiga win Kitamura over. Ryuuji, on the other hand, didn't have the same luxury from Taiga. There were only about a handful of scenes where Taiga honestly tried to help Ryuuji get together with Minori. This, in the end, made Ryuuji's love feel forced, considering that he didn't really have any reason to like Taiga. Instead, it seemed as if he just got used to her being around. 
Characters:
8/10 — Definitely strong and entertaining, this is probably where Toradora! shone the brightest. I found Minori and Ami the strongest of all the cast with special emphasis on the former. Though Minori was presented as an oddball character, she succeeded where other whacky anime characters fail– she had substance. There was meaning behind her odd behavior and even slight hints at a deeper layer that I wish could have been explored more. Ami, though depicted as a spoiled, self-absorbed girl, seemed to undergo an entertaining personality change that was subtle enough to be believable and flawlessly executed. Kitamura, though a kind and chuckle-worthy character wasn’t particularly notable, and the same can be said (but to a lesser degree) about Taiga and Ryuuji— the main characters. Ryuuji is another likable character that makes you root for him, though nothing about him particularly stands out. He’s introduced as a character that scares most of his peers due to his fearsome appearance, but this detail was barely touched upon. In the end, I felt Ryuuji was a flat character— kind, a little snarky at times, and a cleaning-fanatic, but hardly worthy of becoming anybody’s favorite character. As for Taiga, I personally liked her quick tongue when it came to battling Ami’s jeers and her dynamically fearless spirit, though, at times her attitude was a little annoying. There were also times where I was a bit confused because her actions clashed with her personality. For example, though she and Ami seemed to fight and bicker constantly, they decide (without any build-up) to sing a cheerful and festive Christmas song together on stage at a class party because… why not? Perhaps there was a love-hate relationship that built overtime between the two, but I didn’t feel as if it was executed in a subtle yet comprehendible way. 
All and all, everyone was fairly likable and pulled off the series very nicely.
Art / Sound: 
5.5/10 — I don’t have much to say about the art and sound since I don’t often focus a whole lot of time on them with anime. But for the sake of the review, I’ll leave my two cents. The art is decent. I wouldn’t say it’s particularly beautiful, but it wasn’t bad, either. It gets the job done. As for the sound, I felt the first opening didn’t really fit the show. It wasn’t because it was a bad song, but I just felt that its techno-y sound clashed with the series’ genre. As for the other songs, I admit that I didn’t give them much of a listen with the exception of the second ending, “Orange” (a song that I rather enjoyed and found very catchy). 
In terms of the voices, everyone did a decent job and I have no real complaints about it. The only exception to this is Taiga who was voiced by Rie Kugimiya in the Japanese version. Having watched Gintama (another anime where Kugimiya plays the main female heroine ‘Kagura’) before Toradora! I kept getting a “Kagura” vibe. There were times when she sounded decent for Taiga, but when her pitch changed, I just kept picturing Kagura. Kagura has such a vastly different personality from Taiga’s, so to keep picturing her, I couldn’t help but feel a bit irritated. This is just my personal opinion and I’m simply including this tidbit because it did have an affect on my enjoyment. Her voice, to me, just didn’t feel right at some points.
Enjoyment/Conclusion: 
7/10 — Toradora! is a decent anime if you want to pass the time. It does have its excellent points as well as its weak ones. I found myself bored by a few of the center episodes, but the anime as a whole is marathon-able. If I had to give it a grade, it would get a B-. I’m honestly a little confused as to why this anime is hyped about and given as much praise as it has received over the years.  However, I’m not above recommending it to anyone that wants a satisfactory romance story with great slice of life elements.",7
"
                The anime's surroundings are based around high school, just like in the most japanese animes about romance. Although, all have those specific unique aspects, that other don't.
At first, watching first episode, I was about like ""I've seen similar somewhere. I'm quite sorry for Ruuji, must hurt"" and so on. Basicaly, It just didn't grab me.
As I was watching further, the character development actually grabbed me a lot. You see, the facial expresions for every moment, word, are pretty accurate. As well as we don't get those big faces with extra eyes for special expression, which makes it quite pretty more realistic. After all, words ain't
                  everything, actions speak louder.
We see how characters develop in rather a bit unexpected way. All of the characters we see there bump into specific troubles and we slowly find out who they really are, showing you that first impression isn't really everything.
I myself honestly like a lot all the opening themes. First one being quite energetic, second rather more serious, but still, it fits the story well.
Character voicing was quite awesomely done, I was all grabbed in, looking for all expressions, tone of voice everywhere and I just enjoyed it a lot.
I agree with previous previews, it has flaws, nothing's perfect. But, this is a rather unique romance anime, that I don't mind rewatching and definitely recommend to everybody that likes romance and wants to understand emotions better, after all, there's some true knowledge in it, that helps in real life.
Overall rating 10/10, because it gave me a lot of precious knowledge, enjoyment, emotional understanding and a way how to use my free time =)",10

Synopsis : - 
""Despite Ryuji Takasu's gentle personality, his eyes make him look like an intimidating delinquent. Class rearrangements on his second high school year put him together with his best friend, Yusaku Kitamura, and his hidden crush, Minori Kushieda. Along with these two comes Kushieda's best friend, Taiga Aisaka. Her delicate appearance contrasts with her brutal personality. Secretly in love with Kitamura, Taiga agrees to help Ryuji with his love interest as long as he helps her get closer to hers.

✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦
Story : - The story in Toradora isn't the most important aspect, as it heavily relies on the characters rather than the actual story. Think of the story as a 'base foundation', and the characters - the glue that are holding it all together. Of course, there's a background, there's a beginning, middle and end, but again - not all that important. I do like how the story unfolds, peeling off layer by layer of all the characters. Diving deeper into their personalities. More on this later. But overall, Tordaora's story does not have any major plot twists, (except the ending. More on this later.) it is simple as it should be. And it works, very, very well. 
✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦
Art / Animation : - Toradora's visual style is decent. There are moments when it deviates from the way they've been animating things, there are a few intense scenes that essentially require the deviation, but all in all, it's solid. Good to look at. Characters seem believable, environments are pretty nice.
✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦
Sound : - For the most part, Toradora's soundtrack is very generic. There's nothing special about it. Sure, it suits the mood for the most part. The up-beat 'comic' scenes are complemented nicely thanks to the well-fitting OST. But that's all. HOWEVER. There's one track that I absolutely adore. It is played at the best moments possible and I might even go as far as to say it's one of the best I've ever heard. ""Lost My Pieces"". I must also mention the EXCELLENT voice-acting for Taiga in the subbed version. The voice-actress must be really talented. I consider Taiga the epitome of Tsundere. Because till now, I haven't seen a more perfect version of the Tsundere definition I had in my mind. And the actress pulls it off brilliantly. That being said, the English dub is also quite amazing. I had the dual audio version so I was able to hear them both. Oh also, amazing OP1. Decent OP2. ( I was sad when they changed it and it wasn't as good as OP1 ;_; ) and ABSOLUTELY FAKIN BEAUTIFUL ED2.

Characters : - Ah, yes. The BEST part of Toradora. The characters. Takasu Ryuuji, imo, is a very basic 'template' character. Yes, he's interesting enough for me to care about him, but the real star of the show is Taiga. No two ways about it. Taiga simply steals the stage. She's the main focus almost all the time. It's because of her that most of the scenes are hilarious / and / or ( at times ) worth watching. Her personality is that of a typical ( but imo, the BEST ) Tsundere. Taiga's at her best by end of the first half. That is basically the definition of the Palmtop Tiger. ( her nickname. ) But this also means that people who heavily dislike Taiga might not enjoy the show. Because it mostly revolves around her. That being said, the side characters are also seen undergoing a LOT, and I mean a LOT of character development. Well. It's more of *learning* about these characters rather than them actually 'developing', but it's extremely entertaining nonetheless. Entertaining. Enjoyable. That's what Toradora is. Mostly because of its characters. Trust me, if you like the characters in this anime, ( say, after watching the first few episodes or so. ) you will absolutely love it. From Yuusaku Kitamura, Kushieda Minori, Kawashima Ami, to, heck, even Haruta and Noto and the teacher with the unmarried-face, everyone has at least one aspect to them that makes them unique and just a joy to..well, watch. 
✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦
Romance : - The romance between the two doesn't develop early. It builds up till the 3/4th section of the anime and then finally explodes. Trust me, the journey is FUN. The small teases / hints of them inevitably getting together also helps. The way they help each other and over time fall for each other, is really entertaining to watch.  Overall, just an amazing romance. 
I definitely recommend Toradora to EVERYONE. Despite its somewhat disappointing ending, ( varies from person to person ), in the end, you'll be glad you watched it. Trust me.
   OVERALL  :
8/10, a very good anime.

This section changed almost everything. The characters were now showing their true sides or their true colors, or simply developing due to being in certain scenarios. I.E Minori, she was supposed to be the 'good' or the 'cheerful' girl of the bunch. But she ended up being a rather intense and somewhat angry, lonely girl by the end. The drama. Yes. I know a lot of people here DISLIKED the drama, but for me, I didn't dislike it. I didn't LOVE it either. I was okay with whatever direction the show was taking, because it was still interesting and entertaining. It didn't ""wow"" me. It didn't make me cry. In fact, there are very few moments by the end that actually made me 'feel', because of the fact that they overdid themselves in the -drama- area. 
The ending wasn't necessarily bad, but it was just something I wasn't expecting. I was confused. I didn't like the ending much at all. But that's not to say I hate the entire show for it. If anything, the previously mentioned ""different direction of the characters"" made me lower the score even further rather than the ending itself. It's all personal preference I guess. The ending was weird af, true. But I'm glad I watched this show.",8

                                        Mehh!
I love shoujo animes but when it comes to toradora I can honestly say a anime has never made me love it and hate it at the same time, For the first half of the show I was enjoying it and found it pretty enjoyable, Until  the second half where the melo- drama comes in .
 I don't mind melo-drama but when it feels
                  like its getting shoved down my throat that's when I stop, I can honestly say all the characters were getting on my  nerve by the time it ended. And don't get me started on how the ending couple turned out I mean of all the girls why her, I mean I understand why she fell for him,but how in the hell did he fall for her?. She could've been replaced by any other girl even Ami and the relationship would've made more sense.
Overall I didn't hate this anime but the cons severely out weight the pros, I know im  one of the few that didn't enjoy this show that much but I cant see why people praise this show so much.",5

""Love is something that's bittersweet"" 
I know quoting lines from the show is a ridiculously cliche way to start a review, but bear with me. If it works it works. 
That's kind of the special thing about Toradora, if it works, and it does, it works. There can be cliches, tropes, and some pretty ""anime"" things in it, but if it works, it works. 
This may be my first Japanese Rom-Com, but I feel like once I see one, I've seen them all. Maybe its because a lot of these cliche's are almost cliche to complain about. Or maybe its because a lot of them
                  are shared with their western counterparts. Whatever it is, Toradora is both something I feel like i've seen before, but not in a bad way. 
...
I'll be splitting this review up in two sections. Much like this show, i'm going to keep it simple. Pros and Cons. 
_______________________________________
PROS: 
One thing that I've noticed very quickly is the astounding work by Studio J.C Staff. Their effort to bring the characters to life is inspiring. The animation is vivid, frantic, and colorful. The last thing I was expecting is exemplary animation in a shounen, a genre that's become synonymous with slow-panning still-images. 
Its so nice to see movement happen almost constantly on screen. I see characters have a lot of personality in their movements, their glances, their smiles, and their frowns. I can't reiterate how nice this is. It gives the show an immediately appealing vibe. I don't feel like i'm watching someone flip pages of a manga in front of me, occasionally shaking the pages to create a sense of urgency.
Instead, I get an environment that's instantly like-able. Characters are easier to distinguish and remember when each one has their own unique way of... oh I don't know, greeting one another. Needless to say, J.C Staff outdid themselves with the animation, even if the art design was flawed. More on that in the Cons section. 
...
The sound was also good. While not as great as the art, the opening themes were catchy and actually had lyrics that correlated with the actual show. I prefer this infinitely to some stupid self-righteous and vague intros that I see so often in Shounen anime. 
For example, I decided to look up the lyrics to one of the few Fate/Zero intros : 
                      ""My feet I moved in are 
                 Softly healed by my faraway ideals. 
     I grip tightly onto these certain bonds and move ahead, no matter where, 
             The miracle that cut through the impurity on my back.""
What. 
Or : 
                    ""In actuality, everyone wants to be saved, 
                 And their wandering hearts pierce a hole in the sky.""
What does that even mean?! 
What Toradora does above other Shounen is actually semi-creatively make the intros ABOUT the show. In fact, the line I started the review with is from the opening theme. They're catchy and set the tone pretty well. Especially the one in the second half of the show, delivering a slightly more emotional opening. 
...
While the characters are either unmemorable or simply established (more on this in the Cons section), there is one character that absolutely shattered my expectations going into the show. She did this for a specific few reasons that I had a lot of trouble coming to terms with. 
Taiga. 
Mind you, i'm not one of those ""see a cute girl and absolutely fawn-over her"" types. In fact, I value myself as a steel-heart-having emotional brick wall that doesn't get phased or distracted by some meddling anime character. And while I may sound like a Scooby-Doo villain, I promise this has always been what i've been like with television. 
In fact, when Taiga, our main girl protagonist first made her appearance, I hated her. Not the ""oh gosh golly she's annoying"" kind of hate, either. The ""Man, are there any freight trains around the area that can do me the great favor of derailing and crushing this self-righteous asshole?!""- Kind of hate. 
I despised her. Everything about her was almost irredeemably bad. And for every ounce of perfection the main character dripped, what with his cooking skills, fatherly nature, kindness, etc. It seems like the writers packed every negative trait into this tsundere Loli. 
But man, did she ever grow on me. Maybe its the icy cages around my heart beginning to slowly melt with old age. Or maybe its the fact that the writers and animators of the show tactically created this hobbit-sized doll. This is what i'll be attempting to explain. 
As a person, I think that liking someone as a character because their cute is a very shallow way to go about this. Especially for someone like me who's a hard ass and a very rough critic of everything. Its just shallow and lame to be like, ""Well, she's a horrible person... but look at those cute little blushes!"" 
But that's kinda where the show's creative team excelled at. Since this show is aggressively for men, in my opinion (I'll get into this in my Cons), our inherent fatherly instinct gets triggered whenever we see someone like this. 
She's painted as a hopeless, lonely, angry, unknowing, and arrogant little girl and we want nothing less than to help her find her way. It feels shallow, but its a very smart move by the creators. They made her short, and by that I mean REALLY short. I wanted to look this up and apparently there are actual metrics for anime characters. They say she's exactly four feet and nine inches. That's TINY! 
Not only is she short, she's also very small. She encompasses a small space. I don't even mean height-wise. The first real time we see her in a non-aggressive light is her rolling out of a thin locker. 
She is also often shown hiding her face, which is another sign of ""weakness"". And by weakness I mean the kind that you see in a tiny little kitten on the road. 
Again, a very tactical move by the staff and i'm assuming the actual Light Novel writer who made these characters in the first place. She's utterly perfect for this kind of role and while I feel shallow saying this, I found myself totally in love with her character by the end of the series. 
For someone like me, this is an amazing transition, since i'm usually really petty with these kinds of things. If I start out hating something, its really hard to win me over! But Taiga is absolutely adorable and an awesome example of character design done perfectly! 
I wish the same could be said about literally any other character in the show, but one is enough. I'll take it. I'll take this. 
Her story has a nice progression to it too. By the end of the series you feel like you are still watching the same character, but a more developed version... which is the mark of solid character development. 
By the time she really becomes more sincere and not-constantly-angry, chances are, you'll already be into her story. So if there's one thing elevating the ""character"" portion of the review to ""above average"" and not just ""average"" its this adorable plucky tsundere, Taiga. 
...
This leads me to my shortest point. In a romantic show, inevitably, there will be cliche romantic scenes. Things like the ""initial breakthrough"" when a tough-on-the-outside-but-creamy-on-the-inside character finally breaks down. Or the ""main character has dramatic realization about something to do with romantic shit"" cliche. There are a lot. 
Toradora does them all. But for the most part, they're done well. Especially an earlier scene in the show that was one of the most heartbreaking emotional explosions I've seen in anime. 
...
Lastly, the story in Toradora is literally nothing special. But that's what makes a lot of it so deftly done. It baths in Rom-Com cliches from head to toes, but it does them (mostly) in a pretty solid way. 
I never found myself actually groaning at much of these cliches being done. Believe it or not, that's an achievement. In a genre that's plagued with unoriginal and hack writing, relying solely on cliches to tell a story... its really nice to see a show take these cliches and if not go somewhere else with them, at least do them in a way that isn't abrasive as hell. 
That deserves a mention in the Pros section. A cliche romantic comedy that actually feels nice and solidly crafted... for the most part. 
_________________________________________
CONS: 
At its very core, there are three major flaws in the show. Three things that brought this show down a solid point. For this section, i'll be separating them into three parts. 
...
Guy Characters
1.) Comedy 
This is something I have to inevitably bring up. As much as I hate it, this is a romantic comedy. Comedy is in the genre title. Its something that's inherently a part of the show so as someone who is resigned to review the show, I have to bring this aspect of it under the microscope. 
Bluntly, this show isn't funny. Its not offensively NOT funny like a lot of anime i've seen ... looking at you FMA! But I can count on one hand the parts of this show that got anything more than a slow exhale out of my nostrils. 
A lot of anime, especially Shounen anime, has this overdone comedy elements to it where every joke has to be rubbed in your face. As if you are too stupid to get subtlety so they have to yell the joke really loudly to make sure you get it. 
I don't find this funny so I didn't really find this show all too funny. Some of the comedy elements thankfully had a bit more heart to them which made them cute, if anything. Of course this mostly has to do with Taiga, who, as I've said in the Pros section, carries this show on her little butterfly back. 
But unfortunately ""cute"" and ""heart-having"" aren't two things that make a show funny. So unfortunately, this has to be a negative. While it isn't huge and by no means show ruining, if you are like me and dislike very ""in your face"" comedy, then I doubt you'll laugh at this show too much.
More so than not, I found myself grinning with certain characters, which honestly is better than a lot of Romantic comedies can make me do. But still, not even close to the standard that needs to be set. 
...
2.) Anime Ways 
This is an inevitable continuation of my criticism above. Unfortunately, overdone comedy isn't the only thing that I get frustrated at with anime, especially Shounen shows. 
Just like with their lack of comedic subtlety, I find that a lot of anime has a problem with doing dramatic subtlety too. While this isn't as big of an issue as the comedy not landing, a few scenes in the show that were made to have a huge emotional punch didn't land due to them being too hammy.
One scene which book ended an arc in particular was so jarringly stupid and out of nowhere that it honestly ruined any emotion I had stirring inside me. This cliche culture festival arc itself was never the most interesting, but its inability to stick the landing made it one of the more negative aspects of the show. It felt like the show spinning its wheels. 
Another scene where a character comes to a realization regarding their love with another character is initially done with tact, but a very obvious monologue in the middle of their dramatic and emotionally powerful realization makes the scene land slightly tilted. Whilst it isn't nearly as bad as the missed landing with the culture festival arc, its still jarring enough for me to wish that they went for a more subtle approach to storytelling that maybe, just maybe, could've gotten me a little misty eyed. 
Monologues have always been an aspect of anime. This is because Light Novel adaptations have to include the characters thoughts, which are so prevalent in novels. I get that. But certain scenes just don't translate into a visual medium that well if the studio and writers don't put the effort into altering them to become more applicable to said medium. 
Not only that, there's also a glaring issue with character design. While Taiga is universally an a amazingly designed character, there is literally nothing after that. Every other character is just generic. The best thing I can say is that their hair color matches their personality. Minorin is spunky red. Ryuuji is stern and collected blue. And Kitamura is dull-as-fuck black. 
A hilariously dumb occurrence in this show is when the characters praise the class model, Ami's, body. She's a model, so clearly she has to be fit and gorgeous! Yet the shows character design doesn't reflect that at ALL! Every girl character that isn't Taiga looks like they have the same body as one another! Its hilarious but unfortunately a complete flaw in the shows character design.
And this flaw is something that I see constantly in anime. 
...
3.) Guy Characters 
Look. I can go on about how Minorin feels tacked onto scenes half the time. I can go on about how her presence often feels disruptive due to her very unbelievable eccentricity. I can make this the focal point of this third, and final, section. But no. Although she is generally pretty unbearable as a presence, she is FAR from the worst offender. 
Guy characters in this show is what keep it from being a great romantic comedy. Its Shounen guys-appeal roots keep it from maintaining themes that its been building the foundation of the show with. 
This sucks. In all honesty, it really sucks. This sucks because many times I felt like Taiga was too good and likable of a character to be placed into such a shallow love triangle. I actually felt sorry for a character on the META level. Yes, I am a douche bag, nice to meet you. 
Ryuuji Takasa, our protagonist, is a nice, awesome, likable, good-food-cooking, strong, fatherly, friend-having, supportive, guy. Notice anything wrong there? He's literally perfect. 
In fact, a later imperfection that arises from this character still just stems from his childhood, so blaming a kid for having a SMALL amount of emotional issues isn't really an imperfection, is it? Even his problems aren't really HIS problems! He's perfect! He resembles literally no guy I've ever met. In fact, I can't describe anyone I've ever known to be perfect. 
Yet, he, as well as Kitamura, is perfect. With this perfection lays an unconvincing narrative between Ryuuji and Taiga. For the first while their relationship just doesn't seem like something realistic because of his perfection.
In fact, the one imperfection they wanted to establish early on is that Ryuuji has ""creepy eyes."" Seriously, show? Creepy eyes? That's the best you can come up with? Even his ""imperfection"" is something he's BORN with and can't actually change. Its even dropped fairly quickly too!
Meanwhile Taiga deals with very real insecurities regarding her body. Her breast size and overall body structure leads to some undoubtedly relatable moments for girls. 
But If i was a girl I feel like i'd be very uncomfortable watching this show. Every girl character that's on screen constantly has some sort of emotional issue. Ryuuji's Mom, Minorin, Ami, Taiga, hell, even the blue haired school president who I don't even remember the name of ended up having repressed emotional issues!
Like, come on, show! Why are you making it so unbelievably weird? Why not give every guy character at least a modicum of respect when it comes to writing. Why are they either one-note joke machines or just sterile perfection? It makes it seem like they're saving a bunch of helpless girls from loneliness rather than a relationship that goes both ways... like a REAL relationship often does. 
It just feels weird. It can even feel sexist at times. Bluntly, I disliked the way every single male in the show was characterized. While Ryuuji thankfully gets a tiny bit of a personality towards the end of the show, its not nearly enough to create for a super compelling narrative.
Characters bring stories together. If a story is bad, good characters can save that. While the story here is an admirable use of cliche's, its undoubtedly bogged down by characters who just aren't interesting enough to keep the story afloat. 
_____________________________________________
[CONCLUSION] : 
So in conclusion, Toradora might just be one of the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. I never really loved ""Friends"", and I never really watched many anime romantic comedies either. Most romantic comedy movies are pretty god awful, too. With the exception of marvels like ""Me, Earl & the Dying Girl"", romantic comedies are just kind of shitty all around. 
Real recognize real, then. When a Rom-Com manages not to be horrifyingly awful, I can't help but praise it! Apart from maybe the solid sound work, I feel like every aspect of the show has very awesome highs, but also very noticeable lows. 
The story is ridden with cliches, but their done well. If it wasn't for the over Shounen-ing of a few major elements the story may have stood out more. 
The animation is incredibly solid and lively, but the disappointing character designs drag it down to a 7. 
Lastly, the characters have a lacking amount of effort put into them. Especially the guys. But that doesn't stop a small shining fractured star like Taiga to completely carry the show. 
Let me gush about her a little more, too. If you haven't seen this show do it just to see one of the cutest most love-to-hate-but-slowly-love-more characters I've ever seen. I doubt i'll be forgetting her presence on screen any time soon. She's great and the single reason that this show doesn't just sit at an ""above average"" but makes its way up to ""Good"" all around. 
So to wrap up this review in the most cliche possible way, here's another cheesy quote. 
""I hate waiting, but if waiting means being able to be with you I'll wait for as long as forever."" - Taiga",7
"
                [Story: 8.0] Toradora is, dare I say, undisputedly one of the most popular series of 2008. And it's not hard to see why, provided one watches past the initial episodes of misunderstandings, love triangles and such, that is. Because although Toradora began with plenty of elements common in its genre, it ended off as more than just a typical romance comedy. The series isn't just about romance, as it deals with relationships not limited to the typical love scenarios and gimmicks prevalent in most school-life shows. There isn't much to really comment on the story, as the plot itself is rather straightforward and simplistic.
I personally
                  also like the use of a bookend (or framing device), such as how the way the show started mirrors how it concluded; it may be a minor thing, but it does contribute to the overall feel of the series, in that it helped in creating the mood of a finale with proper resolutions. And it's an excellent resolution as well and I like the dialogue being echoed at the end - if there’s anything I've got to complain, it would be that I didn't get the ending that I wanted. I was shipping Ryuuji and Minorin (despite the very obvious series title).
[Characters: 9.0] What's enthralling about Toradora is none other than its cast, each of who has their own distinct personalities that are well explored during the course of the series. Without a doubt, the cast is astonishing, growing (and shedding) past their archetypes and are shown as individuals with depth. For a start, there's Minorin: beneath the eccentric and ever-energetic persona, is a girl with a surprisingly complex emotion and disposition - something one doesn't usually associate with the genki girl archetype. Similarly, despite the initial setting of Ami being the school idol with a snarky attitude, she was gradually portrayed as not only sympathetic, but can be quite a good friend as well. Even Kitamura has his own share of drama to deal with, showing that indeed, being the vice-president of the student council and class representative isn’t a ticket to being infallible after all (breaking quite a few anime conventions in the process).
Most notable of course, is none other than the titular pair of protagonists. Ryuuji, being a nice guy deep down, whose main quirk is being someone with an obsession for cleaning and housework in general, creates an interesting contrast with Taiga's brash and clumsy actions. Some of the interactions those two had in the later part of the series can be both poignant and heartwarming. Overall, their actions and how they open up to their friends are what determined the dynamics of the show.
[Art: 9.0] Toradora, despite being a romance comedy, actually had better animation quality than a certain Fantasy series also made by JC Staff and released also in the same year. Now that's saying a lot for both shows. As a compliment to the studio, Toradora's art quality is fantastic. Apart from the great character designs, much effort is evident in things such as the subtle twitch in facial expressions, the gestures and fluid movements, which are all very well done. These are made all the more pertinent in the later part of the series when it’s more drama-heavy, thus aids in amplifying the mood of the series. For example, refer to the scene between Taiga and Sumire - that alone is a testament to the studio’s success.
[Music: 9.0] The theme songs are all fantastic, with the two OPs, Pre-Parade and Silky Heart being very catchy and addictive, making good use of not just their voice-acting skills, but also as singers. The bgm isn't anything impressive, but they suit the series just as well and the choice of tracks is fine too.
[Summary] With a cast of endearing characters and a nice blend of humor and drama, Toradora is certainly entertaining and worthy of its hype. It may not offer anything new to the genre, but it does it well. High re-watch value, too.
Personal Overall Rating: 9.0",9
"
                Great story, poorly executed at times. 
Characters were very well-developed, but it felt like watching a mystery anime, not a rom-com. Since the viewer learns things mostly from Ryuji's point of view, the viewer is clueless half of the time, forced to guess what the hell is happening 80% of the time. The more serious, revealing moments were not very well-explained, either, forcing the viewer to fill in various blanks with assumptions at best.
The series had a lot of potential and a great concept, but it was simply not straightforward enough, making it both an enjoyable yet frustrating watch.

                TORADORA REVIEW
Toradora is a romantic comedy drama series. The story centres round Taiga Aisaka and Ryūji Takasu as they pursue their love interests, which just happen to be each others best friend. Ryūji helps look after Taiga, taking on the role of her absent father. Throughout the series he tries to tame the Palmtop Tiger(Taiga's nickname) whilst attempting to set her up with his best friend Yūsaku Kitamura. Taiga tries to help Ryūji overcome his shyness to Minori Kushieda. She initially treats Ryūji like her 'dog' and constantly demands he obey her. But as the series continues she begins to rely as Ryūji as both
                  a fatherly figure and a friend. The series tells a very refreshing tale that true love is always closer than you think. I loved the art style, it was simplistic and bright but didn't come across as generic as most of the art styles that make up this highly popular genre. The 4 Opening and Endings where top notch too however I must say the second opening didn't pull me in as well as the previous one. The characters are a stand  out. It has quite a small cast for this genre of anime. But it soon proves you don't always need a huge cast *Lucky Star, cough*. The main protagonists are so different in contrast other rom/com anime but they manage to pull it off in a remarkably, refreshing fashion.  They are very well developed and you will(unless you're dead inside) get very attached to them. Taiga is one of the strongest female leads in an anime. She can have you in tears of joy and laughter but she can drag you into tears of sadness and pity in the blink of an eye. There is one scene in particular had me in a 'awww she's so cute,' mood but i suddenly felt so sad and sorry for her very quickly. Ryuji like Taiga is very well developed. He is a very caring and gentle character. As the main lead he is very good but does lack a but of personality. But the relationship he maintains throughout the series to both Taiga and his often tipsy single mom Yasuko Takasu, as the role of the father is a emotional and often heartbreaking one. This is by far the strongest aspect of the series. The love interests Kitamura and Minori are very likeable too. Kitamura is a strong and selfless character. He suffers from Ryuji's case of a slight lack of personality but he plays the role of the popular classmate well. Minori is far stronger as a side character. She is an extremely deep and complex character and it will take you right up until the end to fully understand her true feelings and personality. She is the highest point of comedy and WTF? moments in the series but pulls it off brilliantly without coming off cheesy and lame. Ami Kawashima is the fifth and final main character. She is a model and a childhood friend of Kitamura. She initially appears to fit the spoilt, man eating tag well. But as the story progresses, much like the rest of the cast her personality evens out and she becomes much more likeable and down to earth. And this is what the series nails completely: CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Bleach and Naruto need to take note on this extremely well developed small cast of characters. The story was at the outset easy to predict but it begins to throw you off course and builds to the point where you are so caught up in it you won't realise it's over until it's over. That for me was my smallest complaint. The final arc seems to stumble under the enormous emotional build-up. It pulls it off very well but it felt a tiny bit rushed. However I loved the ending, one of the most satisfying anime endings you will ever find.
VERDICT
Probably the best romantic comedy anime I have ever seen. Great characters, great story. The emotional depth and build-up is of the highest order. Just a fabulous anime. I foolishly dropped round episode 3. BUT STICK WITH IT!!!! Around episode 6 you'll be pulled into the dramatic story. So please watch it and enjoy the well crafted plot and wonderful cast of interesting characters.",9
"
                Toradora! is really interesting. The story is hilarious and keeps you watching. It draws your attention and is actually pretty amusing from the first ten minutes. The characters are all very unique to the show. None of them really act similar to one another, each has their own personality. This was very refreshing! The series is pretty good although somewhere towards the end, it felt a little drawn out and  fatigued.  It did pick up though and ended up being a really good anime. I think that it is worth looking into despite this problem. 
              ",7
"
                Oh boy, where do I start! Toradora is usually one of those shows that everyone recommends as a great slice of life, romantic comedy anime, and I do enjoy a good romance story, but I do not understand why people enjoy this show at all. 
To begin with, I honestly find the art to be inoffensive and bland. Besides Taiga, Ryuuji, and maybe a few others, I just find the character designs are just forgettable. The students finding Yusaku incredibly handsome is still a mystery to this date. If you find the art to be decent or good, I would not blame you at all.
                  
As for the characters, I find them extremely, extremely, extremely unlikeable. Characters like Ami, Minori, Yusaku, Yasuko (especially you), and most importantly Taiga. I can probably explain opinions for all the characters I find insufferable, but I will just explain my hatred for Taiga. The overall writing and characterization of these characters actively wanted me to continue hating them and/or feel nothing. The anime community's love for Taiga makes me wonder if I even watched the same show. I am usually fond of tsunderes simply because they tend to be some of the most complex, sympathetic, and well-written characters of a show. A lot of the actions Taiga is just simply inexcusable; I know this is just anime, but I am having a hard time keeping my suspension of disbelief. Like how can you honestly constantly physically and verbally abusive someone for cares take for you for free? It is not cutesy or funny; it is infuriating!!! I know she does develop in the later episodes, but I still find her to be incredibly annoying. 
As for the story, there is not much, but that's fine for this setting. 
One redeeming factor would at least be the soundtrack. It is overall pretty good, and the OPs and EDs are great! 
Overall, I found the show to be extremely unlikable with its lackluster writing, characters, and art. If you want to watch a show with some complex and likable characters with actual good writing in a rom-com High School setting, watch Oregairu.",1
"
                This review will contain some major spoilers about the plot. 
Oh, Toradora. You’ve been with me since I joined the anime community. Hailed as one of the few good RomComs, coming out in the time of the Golden Age of Anime. The OP – iconic. The characters – likeable and well written. The story – simple but straightforward. Taiga – one of the best tsundere there are.
I’ve watched Toradora once many years ago, and thought I would refresh my memory and re-explore if this RomCom is really one of the best - or not. 
I can say, my results are meandering.
Toradora starts out with a
                  romantic self-narration by Taiga and Ryuji. This self-narration also is repeated by the same characters at the end of the show. A little nice bow around the whole thing, one might say. For me personally, it’s a lazy device to make the viewer think he’s actually watching something intensely self-aware and romantic from the get go, which it really isn’t all too much. I would even say Toradora is among the least romantic RomComs I’ve seen, but I digress.
Then commence the plot. The whole introduction segment of the characters plays out. Meet our hero, Ryuji who has a bad glare and is mistaken as a delinquent, but he is a simple good boy living with his little airheaded, adorable, single mother who raised him since his father died. Meet our heroine, Taiga, a rich girl that now lives in a way larger house right next to Ryuji’s – way more rundown apartment building – has self-confidence issues due to her tiny size, is rude and violent. She is rumored at the school as the palm-top Tiger (implying she is so tiny she fits into the palm of your hand). The other two main characters that get introduced are Kitamura who is the student council vice-president, all around very friendly-to-everyone, outgoing sweetheart with the blandest personality on earth and best friend of Ryuji; and Kushieda the sporty genki girl, also very outgoing, eccentric, very annoying and Taiga’s best friend. 
You can tell by my description that I do not like the last two very much. Either way the twist of the story is that Ryuji and Taiga both share the misfortune of being seen as rude delinquents by their peers, yet in love with each other’s very lovely and “nice” best friends, decide to form an alliance and help each other confess their love to said best friends.
This very simply premise is not the problem of the show. It’s a basic, cute setup for a – oh not so typical - fun RomCom. But already at the very start of the show, Taiga and Ryuji, barely knowing each other - but hitting it off instantly – have already so much chemistry with each other that everyone in the class already thinks they are dating. Soon after Taiga confesses to nice-guy who not only kinda doesn’t buy it but diverts from her confession by talking about how she found such a good friend with Ryuji. This is not untrue, but a really shit move from someone when you were just confessed to. Right after that scene happened, Ryuji says no matter what happens he will stand right next to Taiga as her equal, as Tiger and Dragon (Ryu means dragon in Japanese) have always been equal friends. This completes the initial introduction arc and also explains the title of the show (Tora means Tiger, dora is for duragon I assume).
From that point we spiral down the SOL school life hell. The show starts to drag instantly. Kitamura already gave a bad impression and then the show starts to drag with mostly boring, sometimes entertaining shenanigans of the duo helping each other trying to get closer to their beloved. A little later Ami is introduced, who is a model who transferred schools and had to stop working for a while because of circumstances that get very easily resolved in the show just in like 2 episodes. That arc was okay. Ami on the other hand is a very high-pitched voiced character that never actually develops as a person, is self-righteous, preachy, kinda pretentious but overall I do not dislike her. At points in the show she is more of a plot device than a character to move the plot in a direction or the other, and while I don’t enjoy the choice of voice for this character at all (I find her almost unbearable to listen to) she is not an offensive character of the show.
Some minor spoilers about the plot start here now. 
Every few episodes of shenanigans and bonding time between Taiga and Ryuji, we get mini-character-arcs that are all very shortly resolved, fairly forced and melodramatic. 
One arc Taiga’s father comes back and Ryuji immediately jumps at the occasion for Taiga to bond back to her father, as he lost his early, completely ignoring all warning signs of that guy being a complete hack. This arc besides being short, rather inconsequential and Ryuji being a self-righteous dick, was weird for me because the moment Kushieda finds out Taiga’s father is back, she yells at Ryuji for not “seeing in the fathers eyes what a dick he is” but then it is revealed that she knew because the exact same thing happened a year before… Okay? You could have told him literally just that. Taiga is way too obedient with getting along with the father because Ryuji told her so, and Kushieda hides information. The arc ends with the father disappointing his daughter, Ryuji somewhat realizing he was in the wrong and us seeing the father never again.
One arc Kitamura goes “insane” because he is actually in love with the student council president who wants to fly to America for academic reasons. The only clue we get for Kitamura being in love with her to begin with is his slight blush at her in the opening and her having motivated him to keep going in the past, told by him to us during this arc. The arc ends with a weird all gone wrong confession and Taiga beating up the student council president in the classroom (a rather iconic scene btw) because she is being selfish and mean. I actually applaud Taiga in this regard, because nobody seemed to care about Kitamura’s feeling being hurt this way, meaning being completely ignored and avoided, besides her. The classroom scene is one of the many weird-kinda-ugly hair sakuga scenes in the show that are very over-animated and overdramatic. The arc concludes with the student council president having an emotional outburst after the fight in the classroom that she feels the same but didn’t want to confess because Kitamura would follow her wherever she goes. This scene was particularly weird for me as we didn’t know nor was it ever really shown, the relationship between these two, so all I can feel for these characters supposedly loving each other is that the narrative told me that this is the case and this is something the character would do. These two aren’t very explored characters so I feel nothing for their circumstances.
Most minor spoilers finished here.
Toradora has the emotional outburst syndrome. Characters will hang around, have fun with each other and then eventually some event happens that makes one or more characters build up their emotional conflict to then outburst it at the climax of the arc and explain to the audience and other characters what the deal was. This happens like this every time. It makes the narrative very forced and artificial. Nothing really happens inside the existing characters circle, it is always something coming from the outside. 
This symptom reaches its final and worst height in the last stretch of the show that I will get to shortly. Before though I want to note that the only character I truly enjoyed in this show was Taiga Aisaka. She is a truly adorable and admirable character who goes through a significant change of character and personality throughout the show. Her self-analytical  dialogue is not bothersome as her family issues are real and hurtful and she is aware of her situation but doesn’t know how to escape from it. Her frustrations are real. And yes, most of her problems come from outside influences, her family currently not living with her, but it’s something build up to from the very start of the show and only escalates as time passes and Taiga grows from it – unlike the rest of the cast it seems.
The last stretch of the show I can only describe as messy and melodramatic. I will describe the whole thing, so if you haven’t seen the show stop especially now unless you want to be spoiled completely. 
The final conflict in the show is from something that happened at the school ski trip:, Taiga got lost searching a hair ornament that Ryuji lost during the day, got hurt and was stuck in a snowstorm. So Ryuji and the gang search her again and Ryuji takes her up on her back, in her delirium Taiga accidentally confesses her love to Ryuji by mistaking him as Kitamura in his outfit. Ryuji tells Kitamura to act like it was him him who saved Taiga, not Ryuji, to hide this event. Later at valentine’s when Taiga gives out her self-made chocolates to her friends, she mentions the ski trip incident revealing that she does not know that it was Ryuji carrying her in front of Kushieda, who was not told the cover up story. Aware of Taiga’s feelings she furiously steps up to Ryuji calling him a liar with the expression on her face like he just murdered her entire family. I want to add Ryuji seems weirdly unaffected by this whole display, like he didn’t just ignore Taigas feelings and is hiding it and all. Then she violently grabs Taiga at her wrist and screams at her to reveal what she mumbled at that night unconsciously that she doesn’t want to say it now. I always found Kushieda very self-righteous, preachy, pretentious and dishonest but this was the icing on the cake. Some flashback for the uninformed, Kushieda at the night of the Christmas eve party, while passing Taiga’s house, sees Taiga hysterically running out of her house screaming at the top of her lungs for Ryuji not to leave her. Kushieda, also liking Ryuji, then realizes Taiga needs him more than her and decides to not hear Ryuji’s confession at the Christmas eve party and leaves right after meeting him, rejecting him coldly with few words. So when Kushieda finds out Ryuji ignores Taigas feelings and Taiga refusing to confess for real, she gets furious. This entire scene is just awful to watch. I cringed through the earth when I saw it. Kushieda screams at Taiga, who screams loudly to let her go, she shakes her around, pushes her against the wall, yelling “I am your best friend” as if Taiga was an amnesia patient. Then Taiga manages to escape. The entire thing is a display of overly dramatic, intense voice acting, hair-sakuga, bad dialogue, cringy framing and bad character actions. It was awful.
Then the story progresses into a downward spiral of 3 endings. Suddenly Ryuji’s mom appears and disagrees with his career choice of not wanting to go to college and instead working and supporting her, which is something she couldn’t do as she raised him. Out of character Ryuji then screams at her for not having become a respectable person who went to college and stop wanting him to have that future. What the hell? The guy who always flashbacks to his mom telling him everything will be okay, talks smack directly to her face? I couldn’t believe my eyes.
Simultaneously, Taiga’s mom also appears, who apparently has an entirely new family with a new child and wants to take Taiga with her. Both disagree and run away. Then they come to the conclusion that they should elope, while not really but somewhat confessing to each other. Remember at this point Ryuji already knows that Taiga has feelings for him but hasn’t really confessed himself. This I consider to be ending one. 
They escape to Ryuji’s grandparents, then bait Ryuji's mother to come, where then a supposedly heartfelt scene unfolds in which the grandparents accept the mother back whom they haven’t seen in 10 years, and guaranteeing she raised Ryuji properly. Ryuji doesn’t apologize to his mother about his bad behavior.
Later that night Ryuji and Taiga act out a marriage kiss, admittedly one of the best anime kisses animated. They agree that they should get married on the terms that both sides parents agree with it. The next day when they both return home, Taiga listens to her voice mails and seemingly comes to the conclusion that she should grow into a respectable person before meeting Ryuji again to marry him. She then leaves school completely. This is ending two. It is very abrupt and makes no sense in honesty. 
Time skip, graduation. Taiga appears at school again, reunites with Ryuji. The self-narration mentioned at the start of the review commences and the show ends with Ryuji finally confessing to Taiga for real. This is ending 3, and then show ends.
End of the most major spoilers.
Before giving my epilogue I want to mention that Kushieda and Ami didn’t get along much probably because they are fakers wearing masks (Ami mentions wearing masks a few times in the show, which was very eye rolling to me) and Ami gives her character review to Ryuji at the end of the show “concluding” her arc I guess. I found it a forced and annoying subplot, but my review is already long as it is.
Epilogue
At the time of the golden age, as a - at the time - less offensive and banal RomCom, Toradora came out at the best time. With one of the best tsundere in anime and a “conclusion” to the romance (even with a kiss, wow) it became many people’s favorite RomCom and generally considered a good anime, even a great one, with blatantly ignoring most of its forced and annoying writing decisions and mostly bland and pretentious cast. Kushieda is plain awful, Kitamura is milquetoast, Taiga is by far the best but only “good” and Ryuji is dense and the show wants to act he has the heart at the right place, and he does, and I do ship him with Taiga but he has some problems. The whole thing with his glare also was brushed to the side over time. There was also a lot of soundtrack repetition and one track particularly sounded straight out of Clannad, which doesn’t surprise me because that show is also not great.
I did not enjoy watching this show again. Most of it is either annoying drama or boring hanging-out. All the arcs are artificial drama set-ups and resolve shortly. The last stretch of the show is simply described as: painful. I am glad I got some new perspective on it, I guess, but I will definitely never watch it again.
If you think I was too harsh and you’re surprised that I gave such a moderate score, it is because a 5 means mediocre and that is what Toradora is. It did a lot of things inoffensively, had a decent start but fails to succeed at basically everything. I don’t hate it but I don’t like it either.

"
                Toradora is my favorite kind of anime- realistic and romantic. If you're looking for a heartwarming, tear-jerking anime to fall in love with, look no further- Toradora is an amazing anime, well worth the watch.
The main reasons I enjoyed this series was because of the superb character development and execution of plot. As a reader of the light novels, I was surprised how well the anime stuck to the plot (which is excellent) and executed it well. Each character had their own epiphany which made them very interesting and added a great deal of depth. At only 
The music in this series also cannot go
                  without praise. The deciding factor in comparing this to the LN or manga would be that while the pacing of plot is off sometimes, the perfect timing of the OST is too good to miss out. Needless to say, I fell in love with both of the outros.
Praise aside, I wanted to also comment on how sometimes the plot seems slower relative to the latter parts. If I were to compare Toradora's enjoyability to a math function, it would look like an exponential curve upward. While the slow beginning is necessary for character development, it is well worth the wait for the events that follow. I docked off points on character based on how believable I thought the characters were, and the enjoyment based on rewatchability.
BOTTOM LINE: Fellow shojo lovers should have no problem enjoying Toradora! SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!",10
"
                This is a classic!
When I first heard of this anime, I didn't watch it straight away because even though my friend told me it was the best anime he had seen, I didn't see a potential for greatness. It looked decent. He had mentioned it other times since then but didn't push me into it. I think it was mostly a ""why not, I'm curious"" attitude that got me to see this show. I watched the first four episodes, not long after I was tempted to see more, and then only stopped because I required sleep. Then I got up early, started again, stopped only
                  because a friend wanted to see me, then finished the show. In short, I was hooked and by the end as close to crying as any anime got me.
The story is about an odd boy named Ryuji and a delinquent girl named Taiga, the palm top tiger. Their first meeting doesn't go well. Then Taiga accidentally leaves a confession letter meant for someone else in Ryuji's bag, then goes to his house to make sure he can't use it against her. Instead he calms her down and agrees to help this unruly girl get together with Ryuji's eccentric best friend Kentemura. Their first attempt fails and Ryuji is free to not help Taiga but he decides to continue helping her, and soon enough Taiga becomes an honorary member of Ryuji's family.
First off, we must mention the ungodly pacing. The amount of content packed into a single 25 minute episode without having to rush it is mind boggling. A typical Toradora episode has the content of two to three episodes of another anime yet flows naturally. This also ensures there aren't any pointless filler with every episode contributing. This is the only series I can think of where there isn't a single bad or lack luster episode. Every episode is high quality, and you'd be surprised how hard that is even for a twenty five episode show. This pacing also gives immense room for characterization and development, where the show shines most. The five main characters all get a good chunk of development, with the main two getting the most of course, and they all get it every episode in some form or other. This results in the anime becoming a home away from home, with a sense of familiarity and adventure in even their most common activities. The humor, while involving some slapstick, is mostly from the character's personalities, be it Taiga's spiteful snarkyness, or Kentmura's zannyness or Ryuji's habits.
This series also boasts amazing drama, and it does so without gimmicks that other highschool romance shows use. We don't see Taiga or Minori getting kidnapped by some biker gang with Ryuji needing to come to the rescue. We don't see attempted rapes or psychotic people trying to murder one of the love interests so they can move in like many highschool romances(and I honestly expected at least one of those to pop up in this show at some point) Now there's not necessarely anything wrong with those plot events, but it says a lot that Toradora can create much more powerful drama with events on a much smaller scale, and don't think this show can't produce some intense moments despite it's light hearted tone.
There are still some highschool romance conventions here but they're all played well. Toradora is up there as an all time favorite of mine, with not many romance anime out there that can compare to it. If you have never seen a romance anime before you should start with this one. 
Since it is one of my all time favorite anime i give it a overall 10. i know most people would give the animation 9 or the sound a 9 but what really matters in the end is your enjoyment and for me its a 10! :)",10
"
                I’m not going to hide the fact that I’m a big fan of romance shows. In fact, Toradora is the first official anime that got me into watching anime and at the time, I believed that this show was a special romantic comedy that I would always cherish and remember. 
A few years later, I have watched a lot more anime and I can still say that Toradora is one of my personal favorites. Why? It’s because Toradora does things the right way. 
Keep in mind that after about 2 years of watching anime, I say it’s about time that I write a review and
                  what better way to start my 1st review than with the anime that started it all for me: Toradora.
[Story]
The premise of Toradora is quite simple, but unique. The main protagonists, Ryuuji and Taiga, both have crushes on each other’s respective friend, Yuusaku and Minori. The story basically follows Ryuuji and Taiga as they agree to help each other win the heart of their respective crushes: Ryuuji with Minori and Taiga with Yuusaku. To be honest, I thought the story was fairly predictable, but it’s still unique because of how they executed it. Both Ryuuji and Taiga start off by heavily disliking each other and are only willing to work with one another to gain the ones that they’re in love with. Definitely not your standard rom-com. The anime does a great job in making it’s concept unique because it falls away from your standard romance clichés and the way how they portrayed Ryuuji and Taiga growing closer with one another was something I never fully expected at first. In fact, the way they decided to develop Ryuuji and Taiga’s relationship was unpredictable in of itself and I really appreciated that. The characters definitely deserve most of the credit for the actual unpredictability of the story and for its overall uniqueness from other rom-com. The story of Toradora also breaks cliches from other romance anime and leaves you with a satisfying ending.
[Characters]
This is definitely the category that Toradora truly excels at. One of the things that ticks me off in any romance anime is how some characters would sometimes “force” drama for the sake of drama. Some of the decisions made by these characters to create drama can be unnecessary and annoying at times. For example, a main character sees his/her love interest talking to someone else and this results in a misunderstanding. But Toradora’s cast avoids these clichés and the interactions that they have with each other feel genuine and real. There are 5 main characters that appear: Ryuuji, Taiga, Minori, Yuusaku, and Ami. All of them go through some impressive development and their bond with each other is only strengthened by the well-executed interactions. Yes, there is still drama in Toradora, but the drama is convincing because the characters actually have a reason and a motive for the actions that they choose throughout the anime. I will have to say that if you’re the type of person who hates tsunderes, then Toradora is an anime that you should probably stay away from because they didn’t call Taiga the ""Queen of Tsunderes"" for nothing. Taiga starts off pretty much the very embodiment of what a tsundere is, but here’s another major plus point for Toradora: Taiga can also be considered somewhat of a deconstruction of a stereotypical tsundere and the fact that she develops heavily throughout the series, turns her into a great character by the end if you are willing to give her a chance. I almost forgot to mention that Toradora breaks the romance anime cliche of having relationships remain unresolved or left open-ended. Trust me, Toradora actually resolves the relationships of its characters. 
[Art/Animation]
Toradora was produced in 2008 by studio J.C. Staff and while I can say that the animation is pretty good for the most part, the art isn’t the best part about this show. Don't get me wrong, I think the art in Toradora is good, but I’m going to be completely honest here; Toradora does not have the greatest art ever. In fact, I’ve seen better art in other anime of the same genre. Unlike most rom-coms that I have watched, Toradora’s art is mainly above average and at first, I was even unsure about watching this show because the character designs weren’t exactly my type. But don’t let this little shortcoming prevent you from watching this fantastic rom-com. It’s important not to judge a show by its cover. Make no mistake however, Toradora's animation should be praised for its consistency. I have to say that the animation in this show does a very good job of being consistent from start to finish and I don't think I can recall an episode where I had to complain about the animation being poor or something. My compliments to J.C. Staff for the animation.
[Sound]
Toradora’s music was composed by Yukari Hashimoto, who composed music for other shows like Golden Time. Besides a few piano tracks that I really enjoy listening to, the soundtrack for the most part is nothing amazing to write home about. Honestly though, I don’t need Toradora’s soundtrack to be godlike or anything cause I watched this show for the story and characters and I got what I wanted. If I wanted to watch an anime with amazing soundtracks, I would watch anime having composers like Yuki Kajiura, Yoko Kanno, Joe Hisaishi, Kenji Kawai or something. One track that stands out to me in Toradora is “Lost My Pieces”. It’s a very nice piece that does a great job in portraying the emotions that’s going on in that specific scene and definitely a track that I could listen to on its own. Lastly, I wasn’t the biggest fan of the opening and ending themes, so yeah. Although I will have to admit that Toradora's first OP is pretty catchy in its own way.
[Enjoyment]
I truly enjoyed watching Toradora and the characters play a huge role in my enjoyment. I think I was able to enjoy Toradora to its fullest because no one completely steals the show here. Instead the 5 main characters I mentioned earlier develop great chemistry with one another that watching them interact with one another is already enough to get me excited. The fact that I’m constantly trying to figure out how each relationship is going to be developed, definitely helped in my enjoyment.
[Overall]
Toradora is a unique and a fantastic rom-com. Honestly, I consider this show to be one of the greatest rom-coms that I’ve ever watched and 2 years later, I’m still saying that. Sure, Toradora is not perfect and in fact has its share of problems though I refuse to mention these issues due to spoilers. Would I recommend watching Toradora? Definitely yes. If you’re a person that wants a unique rom-com with fantastic characters and assuming you can be patient with tsunderes, then Toradora is right up your alley. Thank you for reading my 1st review and remember that this is just my opinion and my opinion alone. If you think my review is helpful in convincing you to watch Toradora then that makes me really happy and if it doesn’t, I’m already happy knowing that you at least decided to read my review in the first place.",10
"
                I don't usually watch romantic anime. I started anime for the fight scenes and still spend most of my time on fighting-focused anime like One Piece and Naruto. 
But as invigorating as those are, they can't beat well-made, 2-cour anime like Toradora!, which are more compact and are more dense plot-wise per episode, if you know what I mean. One episode of a 1- or 2-cour anime is much more fulfilling than the average 1 episode of a long shonen, which typically requires 5+ episodes for minimum satisfaction. I watched the first 10 episodes of Toradora! sporadically, returned to episode 11, and stayed up all
                  night watching the rest. This is the kind of romance story whose ending you can easily predict. This is a story with many romantic conflicts, whether triangles or one-sided or what have you. Toradora! is extremely well-written, with superb dialogue between the main characters as they go through their high school romantic struggles together. What happens is just... perfect. It's sad and uplifting at the same time. The protagonist, Ryuuji, reminds me of Tomoya Okazaki from Clannad. Both spend a lot of their time helping a girl with her problems, both have icky family situations, both are such noble characters. I admire Ryuuji a lot. Even though you can predict the ending, it's still sweet to watch. It's so bittersweet and touching. Love is truly a wily character. Many people make mistakes when pursuing others for love. Watch Toradora!, and learn from it. It says a very wise thing about finding your true love.",10
"
                What I expected to be a stereotypical high school drama turned out to be one of the most charming, entertaining, and funny series I have ever had the pleasure of watching.
I first discovered Toradora! through a forum post and thought I 'd give it a try. To be perfectly honest I wasn't expecting much. Seeing the words ""high school, romance, and comedy"" all together makes me think that it will just be something that takes things too seriously when it doesn't need to and takes things too lightly when it shouldn't. Toradora! however, does the exact opposite.
I won't go into the story for the sake
                  of not giving anything away, however, if you've ever seen a romantic comedy, you can see the ending coming from a mile away. But trust me when I say that this doesn't subtract from the enjoyment of the show at all.
The art of the show is very high quality. It doesn't deviate too far from the traditional anime art style, but at the same time the show manages to have something unique about it. It is very colorful in all aspects, from backgrounds to the characters themselves, even the title card shows this trend. However, nothing ever blends together, which is essential for this type of art style to work. I can't complain about anything in relation to art really.
For sound, I will assume this category refers to soundtrack and voice acting, both of which Toradora! excels in. Both opening and ending themes are very pop-like (for lack of a better term) which I didn't like at first, but they grew on me to the point of them becoming some of my favorite openings in any anime. As for the voice acting, personally I watched the show in English (I know I'm not a real Otaku and Senpai will never notice me) and I absolutely loved the voice acting. None of the characters had an unfitting and/or annoying voice, which usually tends to happen in English dubs unfortunately. The entire cast performs excellently. No complaints in this department what so ever.
Now on to my favorite part of the show, the characters. By far, at least in my opinion, the characters are the absolute best part of Toradora! None of the characters are boring at any point of the show. They aren't one dimensional or dull in the slightest and don't just fall into typical character stereotypes, except for perhaps Taiga who is pretty much just a tsundere character but even then there seems to be an extra dimension to her character that is difficult to explain without spoilers so I'll let you find out for yourself. Even the characters I dislike, I do not dislike them because they are boring or not fun to watch, I dislike them as if they were a real person, for who they are. Not to give anything away but Ami is an example of this. I dislike her most of the time, but the extra dimension she has makes her motivations clear and she ends being entirely different than originally portrayed. I apologize for the vague and all over the place description, but I don't want to give anything away. You should truly experience the characters yourself.
Overall, I enjoyed Toradora! enough for it to become my favorite anime, which says a lot considering I wasn't expecting anything from it. I was honestly disappointed when the show ended, not because I disliked the ending but because I didn't know what I could possibly watch that I would enjoy as much as my first watch through of Toradora! The rewatch value on the show though is incredible, and I never get bored of it.
I would highly recommend you watch Toradora! if you haven't already. I can almost guarantee you will not regret it.",10
"
                For a long time I wasn't interested in this anime, because it seemed like another overrated comedy that I probably wouldn't even find funny. However, after trying the first episode I quickly realized this show isn't what it appeared to be.
My biggest problem with most romances I have seen is when two characters love each other on the very first episode... for seemingly no reason at all. You get no explanation of why they love each other nor do you see the feelings develop. The romance is basically just thrown in your face and the girl almost looks like she's fawning over some guy she
                  thinks is hot or vice verse with a guy fawning over a hot girl. 
Toradora, however, does not do this.
The series starts off rather light-hearted and enjoyable; in fact, there are even some jokes thrown in that I actually did laugh at. The two main characters - Ryuuji and Aisaka - both have a love interest and Ryuuji is friends with Aisaka's, while Aisaka is friends with his. Because of this, they decide to team up to win the affection of the ones they love. So overall it sounds like your typical romantic comedy, but as the series progresses you actually see the main romance in the series progress and you can actually understand why the two characters fall in love.
Later on in the series there was some pointless drama and there were a few other things I didn't like about the series, which prevents me from rating this series a 10. However, this series has a great story, great animation, and a lot of other things which make this story enjoyable, which makes me feel this series a 9/10.",9

                Ryuji Takasu was an ""average"" second year student who was mistaken to be a delinquent due to the pair of eyes he inherited from his father. This caused much misunderstanding to occur in his life in school.One day,he accidentally walked into Taiga Aisaka, who is also known as the Palmtop Tiger for her aggressive personality despite her size.After a sequence of events, the two decided to help each other to attain the hearts of their crush. However,this partnership led to an unexpected twist of events between the two and those around them.
Story & Characters (8/10)
This series is your basic slice-of-life romance story, but not with
                  your typical ""ugly"" loves ""beauty"". In fact both main protagonists are labeled delinquents of the school. While the main female protagonist, Aisaka Taiga, is a ""true delinquent"" of sorts, the main male protagonist, Takasu Ryuuji, is only labeled as one because of his eyes. Oh before I forget, yes Taiga is a pun from the title where ""tora"" is ""tiger"" (Taiga being pronouced as it looks; ""tai-gah"", more puns in the series but thats the obvious one). Now being a deliquent doesn't necessarily mean the protagonists are ugly per se, its just the other students wouldn't exactly put these two characters on their ""top people to date"" list.
Now the series starts of with Ryuuji's first day of the start of his second year in high school. He comes to school with some good fortune, not only finding himself back in class with his best friend, Kitamura Yusaku, but also with his crush Kushieda Minori (also called Minorin). Now when there's something good, there's always something bad and word gets around about Aisaka (she being called the ""Palmtop Tiger"") and after an incident, Ryuuji gets knocked out by Taiga herself. Now to sum it all up, from there thats when the story really begins, Ryuuji somehow finds himself a ""leashed dog"" with Taiga has his owner. Also come to find out Kushieda (Ryuuji's crush) is best friends with Taiga. So from all that, if you're not confused already, shows how complicated things just got for Ryuuji.
Well the story itself starts out pretty predictable for about the first 7 episodes. Actually some could say the outcome of the entire series was predictable, but what made this story stand out more was the execution and characters. Stepping away from our two main characters, we get a character list that's pretty impressive considering the fact. Going with my favorite first, Kushieda Minori. She is the ""athletic"" character who is the type to take charge and very active. In fact at times you wonder if she even has a life, let alone wondering where the hell she gets her energy from. Fortunately enough, just like alot of the characters in the series, she's more complex than she looks. Without straying from the main plot, they allow for plenty of moments to show her ""other side"". She's one of those that puts up a front with people but will only show her true self amongst those she really cares for. She's not the outspoken-type despite being very ambitious. One could say all of her activity is her way of escaping her sorrowed life (however don't think its tragic or anything because its really not, just typical teenage angst).
A couple other characters who get some significant screen time are Kitamura Yusaku and Kawashima Ami. Its plainly obvious what position these characters play. Kitamura plays the ""best friend"" while Kawashima supplies the ""rival"" aspect in the love triangle. Surprisingly enough, after the halfway point, everything that made the typical ""character sheet"" gets thrown out the window. What I mean is, every anime story kinda follows a set format on characters (more true in slice-of-life series than anything else). Like for example, you have the best friend that provides the needed advice, or you would have the childhood friend (who in some cases can be the best friend or love interest) or maybe you might have the dense main character who can't tell when a girl/guy likes him/her. Now what Toradora did was start out with your basic format (i.e. Ryuuji = dense, Kushieda/Kitamura = best friends), but halfway through started juggling these traits around through everyone. No longer do we have the static characters that, unlike other slice-of-life shows where no matter how much their interests change, they're personality traits don't, they encompass all traits at one point other another. A good example of this is, again, at the halfway point (about episode 13 or 14, something like that), Kawashima Ami goes from being a ""rival""-type to more of the ""good friend""-type. Their traits change with the rest of their personality.
This story and character list were well written and really starts to blossom after the first 7 episodes or so. If you're one of those that got bored with it during the first couple episodes and stopped watching it, I suggest picking it back up again.
Art (6/10)
Definitely a step up from alot of shows over recent years. This is one of those series that really does its best to show off the good animation and direction but keeping the sharpen and bright look of the series. Its like when, say, you watched something like Beck, where you want some of the good animation to be accompanied by some clearer and more detailed art? That's not to say Toradora is extremely detailed or anything, but it does supply the feel that it is. I guess one could say Toradora is like the jack-of-all-trades in art. It wasn't the best in any one area, but it did good enough in all aspects of the art that you can't say its average or worse. Its supplies exuberant amount of bright colors that it gives off the right impression of a light-hearted, comedic yet romantic-at-times anime.
It has its faults however in the fact, as said before, it doesn't excel in any particular area. In every average to above average anime, there's always something that it excels at. Unfortunately for Toradora, Art wasn't where it shines the most. For me it was the story, not the art that charmed and made me come back for another dose. Yes its a step up from other shows in recent years, but there are definitely a number of series that excel better in the Art area than this series.
Sound (7/10)
Ah, always my favorite section because music in anime have generally been nice to me. The series surely doesn't disappoint but it does have a number of insert songs that probably sounds better to others than it did me. Now the opening and ending songs were good for this series. ""Pre-Parade"" was a energetic song that really symbolized how energetic the first half of the series was. Bouncing off of that you head into the ending song for the first half which was ""Vanilla Salt"". I can safely say I haven't really listened to that song much because it just doesn't hook me enough. Good lyrics is one thing, but if the music itself doesn't compliment the lyrics well enough, you're going to have problems. For me, I just didn't get good vibes from it. Going into the second half of the series, you have ""Silky Heart"" for the opening and ""Orange"" for the ending. Probably the most listened to song out of all of Toradora is ""Orange"", followed by ""Silky Heart"". When watching the ending video and listening to ""Orange"", it made more sense to me for the tempo the second half of the series kinda followed. ""Silky Heart"" felt more in tune to the feelings of the characters and how they felt when you came up to the end of the series. I had the unfortunate experience of watching the official music video for ""Silky Heart"". Problem there is the dance steps and direction for the video really did nothing for the song. It felt like everything in the video sucked away all the energy that the song had in it. Warning for you all, don't watch the official music video for ""Silky Heart"", it does nothing good for the song in my opinion.
The insert songs are a different story however. They enhanced and played well in the anime, but when I listened to them full-length, outside of the anime, I didn't get the same feelings. Its like they lost all emotion when set on their own for me. Prime example is the ""Holy Night"" insert song. Played great and greatly improved the episode it was played in, but outside of it, I felt it lacked. Songs like these really shouldn't be put on CDs but again, when dealing in the anime world, fans just want to have everything from their favorite shows (yes I am one of them, heh). A completists' dream.
There's not much to say for the VAs. They were good as to be expected for their roles. I will say they have an impressive cast list. Not just for the main set of characters but for the supporting list as well. They had some up-and-coming VAs along with some established VAs in the industry. For example, just a couple seconds ago, while I'm writing this, I was taking a look again at the cast list for this show (been about a year and a half since I've seen the show) and I saw that Nonaka Ai (who played Ibuki Fuko from Clannad, a prominent character in the series) played the role of a supporting character known as Kihara Maya. Reason why I didn't know this is because I didn't see Clannad until the summer following the ending of Toradora (Toradora ended in March of 09, watched Clannad in the summer). To see such a cast list is really promising. There's nothing to be worried about in the VA department of this series.
Overall (7/10)
This series was slated as a 25-episode series, but I guess they wanted to maintain the 26-episode length that the anime world is notoriously known for, so they threw in a special as the 26th episode. Its obviously not an episode needing to be watched in regards to the main story so no need to bend over backwards to see it. Any how, there's a lot of good things to say about the series but for a change of pace, I'm ma head straight into the bad first.
Fact is there's nothing really standout-ish about this series aside from some pretty well written characters. Now some would say that's a good thing and why others would list this series as ""perfect"", but that's not correct. For a perfect series everything would stand out and make for a long discussion about each part. So far the only portions I've elaborated on were the characters. I talked a bit about the sound but that's only for tidbit information I thought was interesting to include. Unfortunately its a pretty hard stretch to sit here and talk about Toradora for more than maybe 10 minutes before you start repeating yourself. That's pretty much how long this reading should be, give or take a couple more minutes. If it was up to me, this entire overall section would've been put up in two sentences but I figure I'd be better off explaining myself a bit more.
This series' re-viewability is extremely small. Once you've seen it once, you remember everything. I stated earlier that its been year since the ending of Toradora and I haven't re-watched it since, yet I was still able to give you a pretty good summary of what happened in the first 10 or so minutes of the first episode. I could literally sit here and tell the entire story, episode by episode, without having to re-watch any of it. That's a good and bad thing.
Toradora was a well executed series and has a charm to it that makes watching it fun and interesting, yet one could say the charm was too strong. Take your favorite movie for example. You get drawn back into because not only did you not catch everything the first time, but you enjoy it enough to watch it over and over again without getting tired of the same ol' stuff. Toradora on the other hand was too strong where you loved watching it, but paid too much attention to all the details which makes you lose the need to re-watch it. I will give this series credit though, the jokes were pretty funny and I found myself laughing time and time again.
Overall, definitely one to pick up and watch through. In fact I urge people to at least give it a shot for the first 14 episodes (second half starts at episode 15), after that make your decision. However don't be surprised if you decide to include this in your DVD collection, that you never watch it more than once more for a long time.",7
"
                I'm going to be honest right now: Ever since I started getting involved in the anime community, I've constantly made fun of romance anime. There are just a lot of preconceptions out there, and I (maybe regretfully) had a lot of bias based upon the views of others. So when I heard about Toradora! from a friend (FinalFlashX on this site, if you're curious), I was somewhat hesitant to view it. I thought it had great potential based on his review, but I also thought it could be something that just wasn't my cup of tea. 
I'm here to tell you that, after viewing Toradora!,
                  I instantly placed it as one of my favorite anime of any genre. 
One of the things that really perturbs me is when someone states an anime like Toradora! is bad simply because they dislike romance, as I used to do. It's unfair to discredit it as a whole just because the genre isn't to your liking. So, before you click ""not helpful"" on my review just because you think romantic storytelling is ""stupid"", please give this a read and reconsider your opinion.
STORY:
Toradora! is a well-crafted plot that, aside from a few minor issues, makes a lot of sense. It's important to keep in mind the age of the characters here: high school kids. Thus, a lot of erroneous decisions with poor logic will be made, and it reflects on the realism of the story because it's not unintentional, either; most poor decisions are reciprocated with backlash of some kind that spurs character development, so it's not by any laziness on the author's part. 
The pacing of the narrative is a double-edged sword. For one, it's a perfect length for character development and gives plenty attention to the development of actual relationships between characters rather than forcing anything. And I'm not talking about romantic relationships only; development between friendships is given a lot of thought and attention as well. On the other hand, though, the story suffers from a delay of the inevitable. From the beginning it's not hard to tell the gist of the end result, and the whole story continues to make it somewhat obvious. However, in my opinion that's not really a large issue; just because you know what happens doesn't mean you know HOW it happens, and the journey is the most fun and entertaining part.
Sometimes I hear people saying that Takemiya should have expanded upon the world a little bit, but it wasn't really necessary seeing that it was set in a world that's exactly the same as ours. She gave insight into the important things, such as Taiga's family and the school, and that's all that I could ask for as a viewer. 
One of my main issues with the plot was that the narrative wasn't very conceptually creative. There weren't an abundance of cliches by any means, and while there were some surprises, overall it maintained a fairly generic structure. If not for the fantastic characterization, it would have been rather bland in my opinion. However, that only knocks it down a notch or two because it was overall an entertaining storyline regardless. 
Thematically, Toradora! isn't very deep or profound. Some of the main concepts explored are the obvious in a romance, but the ones that were more interesting to me were the ones relating to beating the preconceptions people set for you in order to achieve something great, e.g. love. This will be explored more in the character section.
CHARACTERS:
I'll just say it now: the characters in Toradora! are absolutely phenomenal. 
Takemiya does a fantastic job by creating misconceptions that are removed with depth to each character. Every character of the main cast begins as an archetype/cliche, but quickly she creates explainable layers to all of them, making them well-rounded and complex. It serves the theme of being able to get past surface-feature qualities very well. Creating conflict between the outer appearances and inner characterizations of the characters makes them very interesting and likable as well.
Throughout the story, meaningful development is given to all of the main cast. This story is character-driven, and it is reflected beautifully in the writer's progression of the tale. Taiga, Ryuuji, Ami, and Minori are all very, very well-written and complex characters, and that alone is worth the price of admission. (In your case, probably free, but... shut up! It's a phrase!)
Hell, even the minor characters are entertaining and fun to watch. They aren't the most detailed characters in the world, but they serve their purpose well. Not every character has to be dynamic and complex; if they make the story better, then that's all there is to it, and the minor characters keep a lighthearted mood and aid in the development of characterization and plot. 
The character relationships are also very well-written. They are paced well and develop slowly and meaningfully while maintaining some idealism with realistic outcomes. They lead to great characterization and development and are perfect examples of relationships in the anime medium in my opinion.
ANIMATION:
Overall, the animation is very solid. The characters look fantastic, and the backgrounds are well-drawn. The definition is also very clean, although that's more of a benefit of the time this was made rather than anything special on the animators' parts. 
I will say that there are several scenes that look very... meh. Particularly the scene in which there is a fist-fight. The movements look very choppy and all the high-definition is replaced with very average looking animation. This could be due to a budget change or something, but the episode following this looks back to normal, so I'm not quite sure. 
While the character design is usually good, not much thought was put into some of the minor characters. For example, there is a somewhat important character who looks almost exactly the same as one of the main characters, and a very minor character who looks nearly identical to a different main character. While the mains look very unique and well-fashioned, the minor characters don't have that benefit. 
SOUND:
The soundtrack in Toradora! is absolutely fantastic. For all types of moods there are great tracks that are used in very fitting spots and that aid in the emotional aspect of the show. I was a big fan of the first opening for whatever reason, and the second opening was okay, while I thought the endings were just average, but the soundtrack absolutely makes up for that.
The voice acting in both the sub and the dub is phenomenal. I slightly prefer the dub but I will say that you can't go wrong either way. Taiga and Ami really stood out to me in the dub, and I also liked Ryuuji's voice actor a lot, which is a bit of a controversial opinion, so prepare for maybe some dissent in what you think versus what I do. 
OVERALL:
Toradora! is a truly great anime. If you like the romance genre, then you will love this anime. If you don't, I think you will see that it is written well enough where you will appreciate it, but maybe not think it's for you. If you haven't given romance a try, this is a great first step. I recommend it to everyone.",9
"
                (My very first review, lol). I'm into a lot of animes, but the least anime I watch is Mecha. Romantic Comedies, Action, Slice of Life, Drama/School are my thing. Few examples of what I watch; Anohana, Angel Beats, Attack on Titan, Darker than Black, Toradora, Kaichou Wa Maid Sama, The Devil is a Part Timer, Witchblade, Heaven's Memo Pad, etc. 
These are solely based off of my opinions and everyone is entitled to theirs, of course.
My short version of the review: One of my favorite animes, good OSTs (Lost My Pieces). 
Toradora, I actually finished watching the sub but I gotta say that the dub
                  version was good. Most romantic comedies are a bit cliché but which anime now and then aren't? It's like everything is cliché. Nonetheless onto the review and ratings of the anime.
The story (10): It wasn't too cliché, you have opposite protagonists who are feared by many but make one hell of a team. They like each other's best friends and you watch their acquaintance/friendship blossom throughout the series. I like it because the story carries the story instead of some 12 episode romantic comedy and the ending, not typical endings like some romantic comedy. 
Art/Animation (9): The anime was had good animations and drawing. It's a lot better than other animes I've seen. 
Sound (9): I enjoyed the dub version and the OST is just awesome. Most of their voices were good/convincing. When watching English dub, sometimes they can't really pull off the voice or match it with the character so that's why Sub is what I prefer but some animes can have good dubs and Toradora is one of those. 
Character (9): At first I've wondered why Ryuji had more slanted eyes and those are the traits of his dad. Every character were developed good, could say that Taiga looks a lot like Hiyori from ""Hiyokoi"". Both short, light brown hair with hazel like eyes. I tend to find that ""celeb"" like anime characters are a bit... snobby and stuck up, which is a sort of cliché but they are a good asset to making animes a bit interesting. Also the characters get into their emotions which shows you a side to someone, showing that they too aren't always what they seem to be, like the quote ""Looks can be deceiving.""
Enjoyment (10): I just enjoyed this anime, as I've said before it's one of my favorites. They kept me in a good mood, laughed when remarks were made to someone, sad when that sort of scene comes on.
Overall (10): I've enjoyed this anime as others, it get's me in my feels which I like because even if animes are animations, you can learn things from them (it sounds silly but that's what I believe.) You can learn anything from anyone.",10
"
                Imagine having to write a story, possibly a love story. 
There are two ways to make it interesting. The first is to create a lot of unexpected events, twist and backstabs that create interest. The other is to simply write interesting characters that create interest even in everyday events. 
You almost always see the former. The reason is simple, adding more flat/cringeworthy characters or writing an absurd plot twist take little effort and still keep the user interested. On the other hand, creating an everyday story with no twist and making it interesting by having great characters and great character development is something that is
                  seen extremely, extremely rarely. Especially so in anime, where the classic love comedy is full of absurd misunderstandings, copious amount of tears and a sometimes a load of female character only to make you wonder ""who will end with who"". 
As you may have guessed by now, Toradora! is a case of the latter. There are no plot twist, no unexpected new characters, no unexplicable sudden change of minds, no supernatural revelations. You aren't here to wait for exceptional events, and in fact the story begin by telling you how it will end, even before you start looking. The anime name ""Toradora!"" is the combination of the names of the two main protagonists. Four of the main five characters are already all here from episode one, while the last appear in episode 5. From there it's only well-written and believable character development.
The fact that the anime manage to be interesting even when you already know the ending and nothing exceptional happen (to be honest, you could consider two episode to be something of exceptional, i personally don't) tell a lot about the strenght of its writing and especially of its characters. No one of them fall in a clear stereotype, no one of them do dumb things only to make the plot progress, they but do only what they should do. And everyone of them is a beautiful character with many layers, like a real person (ironically, the least detailed ones are the two mains, for accessibility reasons). 
All the story progression happen at the right pace, and there are a lot of hints and hidden details you'll hardly catch at a first view but that will clarify a lot of more ""obscure"" behaviours you may notice.
Not only the writing and the characters are good, the double level of reading of the plot is also one of its strong point. While Toradora! may appear at first as a love story, and a lovable and well written one (remembering far more the classic american love story than an anime), Toradora! is not just that. Toradora! is a story of growth and show, even drastically, that the desire we have can not always be fulfilled, that if they can, there are sacrifice to be done, and it does so even at the cost of going against the viewer's expectations (so beautifully meta). But it's not a simple coming of age story where the character reach ""maturity"". Toradora! show that growing isn't a trip with a destination, but rather an endless discovery in all directions where you must sometimes stop and look again at what you have thrown away during your wanderings. While this is not a really new or amazing concept for other kind of media (books and movies have been there countless times), in anime such a deep message it almost come as a shock, especially with a good execution to boot.
To put it simply, Toradora! is the the best love comedy in anime form since the times of Maison Ikkoku, and it share with MI its ability to not be narrow and focused only on one aspect of life, but it space on everything  (from work to family to fears), even if narrowly due to the short duration of it compared to MI. And even if Toradora! doesn't best Maison Ikkoku (it has still many, many flaw that i won't list here, almost all due to the nature of modern anime), it has given me the hope that Japan can still write a good love story, even if once each twenty years.",9
"
                Romance stories have begun to fall in a trap it seems. Many become predictable and unoriginal, turning into yet another harem comedy to join the ranks. Romance stories need to be original, but not at the cost of emotion that goes along with falling in love. Sometimes it isn't as easy as seeing someone and pursuing them until they fall in love with you. God knows, hearts will be broken when that same person falls in love with someone else. Its not about the mind, its about the heart, and following it. Add a little slapstick comedy and a cute tsundere, and you have the
                  heartwarming story of Toradora.
Toradora takes a common theme (two people fall in love with the others best friend and grow closer) and finds a way to make it more entertaining. Toradora blends romantic comedy and drama in a way that may surprise viewers. The comedy is very funny and cute, and the drama will have you watery eyed and longing for a happy end.
The art is very good, but it would be what I consider the weak point. The overall design is cute, and there are scenes where the art is simply breathtaking (remember to watch out for the xmas scene), but at others such as fight scenes, the art is quite strange and the characters look off. However, in a way it adds a certain intensity.
The music is gorgeous and  adorable at the same time. The music will keep the mood bouncy when the characters are up to their shenanigans, and will move you to tears at the sad moments. The soundtrack is masterfully done. 
The characters would be what I would call where it is the straongest. Each character has so much personality that you feel like they are real (Ami being the strongest for me), and whenever one shows up, you always feel that something is going to happen.
I enjoyed this series immensely, and would recommend it to everyone. This is the perfect romance anime, and force viewers to have opinions about what they feel. They may not agree with the outcome, but who is to say that the way they fall in love is wrong, or who we fall in love with is wrong? If you want to watch an anime that will make you feel good about the love that you have, whether it be for family, friends, or your loved one, this is the one. You will not be disappointed.",10
"
                Someone recommended this anime to me and I have to say thanks! I really like slice of life animes because the anime genre is so filled with mech, fantasy, and otherworldly animes to the point where a good normal anime with normal characters is a refreshing change of pace. However, even if the anime features normal characters, the characters still have to be interesting, exciting, and just plain watchable and the creators of Tordora understood that. My first impression of the anime with the male lead Ryuuji and his problem of people thinking he's some sort of thug based on his looks grabbed my attention,
                  it seems interesting because who hasn't been prejudged by others based on their looks? But when we meet pint sized Taiga I became a little apprehensive. The reason is because for some reason anime creators and writers never seem to give women much diversity on a show, especially when it is a female lead. So when I saw her, I thought. Okay, she will either be a mega annoying whining bitch or some super sweet goddess. It turns out that she was neither. As a matter of fact none of these characters can be truly described by one or two words. But I can use one word, human.  Seriously there isn't a character I can say I dislike because one moment I am hating certain actions then the next moment I am rooting for them. I couldn't help but feel a bit nostalgic while watching because it reminded me a lot of my days in high school and all my friends who were very similar to many of the characters on the show. 
I don't want to give away too much but the story is about two people who meet and form an almost instant friendship as they help each other get the person they are crushing on. Although the story is simple, the viewer has to almost decipher the words and actions of certain characters and sometimes even when you think you have their feelings sorted out, you could be wrong. However, as good as the story and the characters are, it is not without its flaws. For example, there is a certain character who just stops liking another character and you have no idea when it happened, this is one of the things the viewer is left to decipher, which I don't think it should have been done that way because it just comes across as the writers finding ways to add drama to the story, although the viewer is given subtle hints to leads to the characters decisions, we never see that final realization that ultimately leads to the choices they make. another example, there was a certain female character who suddenly began acting strange and we find out later that it is because that character has always liked a certain male character, However, we are never treated to a single moment to indicate that this female character ever had romantic feelings or the male character, we are just told by another female character that this particular female is good at pretending so you're left to assume that she fooled the viewers by her actions and now her feelings are all coming out. 
Certain actions from the characters ticked me off near the end but the writers made up for it with a great ending that remains true to the characters in the story.",10

                                                  characters
cons- At first glance this anime looks to be filled with a cast of cliche characters. Minori is your seemingly cliche strange, energetic, air-head sports freak. Taiga appears to ba a textbook ""Shana"" moe B.A. with a hidden cute/soft side. I could go on... but I think you get the point.
pros- In the first half of this anime it seemed as if the cast was randomly thrown together and then the writers were just praying for the best. but right around the half way point or so I noticed something was up. take Minori for example. She was introduced as a strange, energetic, air-head sports freak; but somewhere along the road in the anime she began to change to totally contrast how she was portrayed at the start of the anime. Why would you almost completely change a character halfway through an anime of this length? The answer came in a later episode that explained why she acts the way she does. The point is that the authors didn't just randomly come up with and change the cast on some whim or because it was being used as some plot device. The characters were well thought through, defined, and well explained the anime. 
- Individuality the characters are not all that; but when you put this cast of sundry characters together; that is when they really shine.
- On another note I really liked the fact that A: that the Male lead actual has a personality. and B: that the authors understand how to use the supporting characters.
                                                     Story
cons- to be perfectly honest I didn't really like all the cliche fillerish School comedy stuff they did in the first half. I think if they did it with more of a slice of life POV it wouldn't have thrown some of us for a loop like it did when it got more slice-of-life/drama at the end. I think the general Idea was spot on of trying to have fillerish episodes that slowly get the viewer attached and cleverly and narrowly avoiding the ""hinted"" eventually ending. I just didn't think that the way they presented it was the most successful way to have it played out.
pros- The authors almost completely maxed this story out. They did a very good job of keeping the pace feel right on for and when the situation called for(meaning It didn't feel rushed and I wasn't bored at any point). 
- They used the cast of characters to build up this fairly simple drama plot into something awesome. 
                                             comedy
cons- not gonna lie, that pet bird Ryuji has is one of the biggest fails of comic relief I've ever seen......
pros- I found myself laughing at multiple points in the anime. 
                                          sound/music
- Pretty good OP/ED.
- The background music was well placed 
- Most emotional moments that were accompanied by some sort of music did a great job of multiplying the moment.
animation 
- minor glitches here and there but unless you knew what to look for or were looking hard for them they're not apparent.
- It's J.C. staff animation so expect that level of animation + some
- one of the best kiss scenes I've ever seen in any visual medium...... Ever.
                                 Overall/closing thoughts
toradora takes you on a ride of classic high school comedy/drama and somehow takes you into the genre of Romance/slice-of-life. This mix of humor, craziness, confusion, awesomeness, drama(ness) and romance makes Toradora! truly standout in nowadays Romance genre.

Authors note: I usually don't give anime such high ratings, but I do praise when its deserved. Also, plz take a few seconds to wright a reply on anything I could improve in my reviews. Criticism is always welcome, negative or positive. Also Everyone has different experiences in life, therefore I don't expect everyone to have the same opinion. Other than that I would love to hear what all you guys have to say and any anime suggestions for future reviews. thanks for reading!",9
"
                I decided after looking at my list of all of the anime I've watched, I HAD to start expressing my feelings and critique (if you will) for at least some of them. So I thought why not start with one that impacted me most. I'm no pro reviewer. I'm just a guy who likes anime. The normal guy. I don't watch a show to break down everything about it piece by piece... I'll explain why I ENJOYED watching the show. what DREW ME IN. what ENTERTAINED me.
Ladies and Gentleman, the Rom-Com you've all been waiting for. The love story other anime only WISH they could
                  tell. I give you, Toradora.
Now look, I know none of you are dumb. So I know that when you read the little summary of the series you know what it's about and have an obvious idea of what will happen. You've got the kindhearted but unfortunately ""evil faced"" Ryugi, who all he wants is for people to not view him as a delinquent. And then you have the feisty, adorable, brutal little Taiga. These two happen to cross paths by LITERALLY crossing paths, ending in Ryugi getting knocked on his butt by Taiga's fist. Now it just so happens the two are both in love the the best friend of the other, so they make the agreement to help each other get with the ones they love. And of course as you can guess the more time they spend together the closer they grow and their relationship develops... etc.
Ok here's where I do that thing everyone does and separates my review into sections and stuff...
Art
I'm not an artist so I can't give you some pro critique, I thought it looked great and it never came off as ""bad"" to me. In fact I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Sound
Also not my area of expertise. I gotta say I love the OPs and EDs to this series. I catch myself humming them sometimes. So that's a good thing in my book. As for the rest of the music it blended right in and never took away focus from the show so...I guess that means it did its job right?  
Story
Excellent. This show's pacing and plot were great. I absolutely loved everything about it, The journey the writer takes these 5 characters on in 25 episodes is beautiful. Now when I say journey I don't mean an actual adventure (obviously). I'm referring to an emotional journey. The growth of these characters in their friendship with each other. The depth behind each of their choices, their feelings... it's unrivaled. 
Also I'd like to throw in that being that this is a romantic comedy. While it is in fact focused more on the romance it is NOT without good humor. This IS a funny show. Ryugi and Taiga play off each other perfectly, providing great wit and funny antics between them.
Character Development
my god...I mean...  wow. 
Each of the five main characters to this show are unique, beautiful, and perfect. The writer begins with making them out as 5 of the main cookie cutter character types: the ""average guy"", the feisty tsundere, the ""weirdo"" girl, the student council member, and the shallow b****. I can't explain in depth each and every character so I'm gonna give one of my favorite examples in this show. 
Ami (the Shallow B****)
When we are first introduced to Ami she is a whiny, selfish...you know what, disguising herself as a sweet ultra ditzy girl so that everyone will like her. Now of course she only shows her true evil colors to the main characters, thus revealing her ""fakeness"". Totally easily hate-able character right? However she comes to grow so much throughout the course of the story that she eventually becomes one of the most genuinely honest and real characters in the show, to the point she actually forces other characters to be more honest with themselves. 
It was really awesome to see such a change in the main characters as the show progressed.
Oh and sorry if i'm ""spoiling"" anything... I really don't think I am though.
This show is wonderful in every way. The writer of Toradora took the lives and deepest emotions of 5 teens and just laid them out for us all to see. It's as if he was saying ""Do you understand how they are really feeling right now?... Well I'm gonna make damn sure you do."" And boy did he, ever so spectacularly.
Do you like good romance? do you like SO FREAKING WELL developed characters? Do you like feeling emotionally attached to an anime? Then Toradora is the anime for you.",10

                     This review contains spoilers. Read at your own risk.
           Toradora is often a staple for the Rom/com genre.  Considered endearing and full of life. I couldn't disagree more. With the obligatory hyperbole out of the way I may dive in deeper.
Toradora begins on the hope that you would sympathize with the protagonist. Due to the fact that he has unusual eyes, the lead is distrusted and feared by those who don't know him. An attempt to distinguish from the world it seems. However it did little for me. The
                  lead is the dreaded character with just about no character. Dull and selfless. He agrees to help the Female lead even after: she punches him in the school halls, attacks him in a classroom and tries to steal his school bags, then attempts to murder him in his residence. All in the first episode of course. After the assault subsides she explains how tsundere she is and misplaced a love letter in his bag. However our very own Sherlock Holmes learns how the protagonist is interested in her own best friend.  A rather neat arrangement.  Females lead's target, henceforth known as friend 1, spends only token time with his alleged close friend and is a stock and barrel bore. Friend 2 (Friend of Female lead) is the classic happy go lucky joy bringing character, who as usual takes a 180 and becomes the self loathing rut, who only derides herself and refuses all others company. Insert one-sided characters, romance swap, excessive melodrama, and you have the story of Toradora happy birthday. I will say however the model girl is the only dynamic character and was bearable to watch. She is unfortunately regulated to a minor third wheel character near the shows end. 
     The art was decent enough. I do greatly dislike the design of the female lead however. The Op and outros, while not memorable were decent enough, you could say they were a nice break from the show itself.
     All in all I would recommend the show, not due to any value or enjoyment but because it is a case study for overused tropes native to the rom/com genre. At best an anime to get yourself into anime, a frequent viewer of the genre should be able to point put it's flaws. Not counting any nostalgia they may have attached to the show.",2
"
                In my book, any guy who stays up a whole night to make fake swimsuit boobs for his insecure friend is a keeper, you don't need 25 episodes to realize that!
Instead of writing a classic review, i decided to make a Pro-Con list because there were some things about this show that didn't really tickle my fancy and would have liked to know about them before i started watching (by reading other reviews).
Pros:
-interesting plot twists
-interesting characters, great lead male
-funny as hell firs half of the season
-artCons:
-predictable story
-the show had a haremish feel to it though that wasn't mentioned in the description
-too much geometry: forget love triangles, this show has love squares
-overused ""oblivious of my feelings"" routine
-length of the show, some episodes cold have been trimmed off
-ending (felt a little bit rushed and silly)
Though it's not the best romance series ever made, this show has been really enjoyable.Don't let the length of my cons list fool you, if you are into that, give it a try!",8
"
                It's hard to come up with an opening sentence, I mean, this show was so unbelievably bad. It was abismal, mind-numbingly boring, fucking trash. BUT, since watching I have searched for the answer to why people like this show, and I think I've found something. Actually, no I haven't.
Characters - The characters in Toradora are either generic to the highest degree, or they're Taiga, and just might be the worst character in existence. The main characters Taiga and Ryuji have the personalities of rocks. Ryuji is an average nice guy and Taiga is an average tsundere, there is basically nothing else to these characters. I’ve
                  heard some say that the characters in Toradora are rich with development but all I could see on that front was Taiga finally growing in the last 5 seconds of the show and a side character named Ami learning how to be less of a bitch. Ami’s development was decent at best spo I don’t really have complaints about it, but Taiga’s development was executed very poorly. As I said earlier, she is a tsundere, but not just any tsundere! From my experience, Taiga is the most extreme tsundere I’ve ever seen. She beats people up at every turn, and it isn’t even limited to her love interest, she is just the definition of a prick. She remains this way for 24/25 episodes and until  30 seconds near the end of the last episode, she’s finally nice. How sweet. I guess this technically counts as development, but if you want to stick with this little cunt for 24 and ¾ episodes until she actually grows, please do. Trust me, it’s not worth your time. I find it hard to believe people can actually call her cute, root for her pursuit of romance, or most importantly call her a good character. As for the other 3 characters, Kitamura, Minorin, and Ryuji, they don’t get development. I heard that Minorin does, but no one has actually bothered to explain it from the many people that I asked so I can only assume Toradora fans have no clue what they’re talking about. While we are on the topic of inorin (and Taiga as well) I just want to slide in the fact that no voice actress has made me want to mute what I’m watching aside from these two characters. I didn’t come here to hear annoying orange on helium crack some even shittier jokes than usual.
Plot - The basic plot of toradora is, just like the characters, lacking originality in every way. The 2 main characters go through the trouble of trying to get the other one laid only to realize they wanna bang each other. Everyone is constantly put into a generic and predictable high school romcom situation where basically nothing happens except for small remnants of “rElAtIoNsHiP dEvElOpMeNt”. This results in an extremely predictable storyline with little to no reason to be invested. A big example is when Taiga's dad come to town and she tries to mend her relationship with the help of Ryuji. But nothing actually happened so there was no point at all. If someone read the synopsis and saw the cover art, they’d immediately know most of what they need to do on this show and see how it would end. Don’t even get me started on the pacing holy shit. I guess if you enjoy the shitty and flat comedy then you won’t mind, but I’m not trying to wait 24 episodes to see some romance happen. I’m fine waiting to the end of a 12 episode slice of life, but 25? I can’t believe that this was green lit. This isn’t even mentioning how rushed the end was compared to everything else. OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Throughout the whole show it’s just generic romcom scenarios where nothing happens. It’s as slow as a snail. Around 24 I think though, now we get going. Taiga and Ryuji finally kiss in a scene I could take about as seriously as I can take an annoying orange on helium kissing someone. Then they get married. Well that went from 0 to 100 fast. As if I already couldn’t take it seriously, now I just thought it was really, REALLY fucking stupid. Like c’mon, they had their first kiss and the natural next step isn’t a first date or maybe making it official, no it’s marriage. 
Aesthetics (art, animation, sound) - It was horrible. The OST was like everything else, generic. The animation was just bad, the art is about what you'd expect from a 2008 anime from a studio that puts out too many shows, and I think I’ve already covered the worst part of the sound, Taiga and Miorin’s voice actresses. It’s not even an exaggeration to say that I cringed when I first heard them speak, and a few times afterwards (I watched sub btw). Also the openings and endings are just utter shit. Maybe, maybe I could say that the first opening is passable but I can’t lie to myself, it’s far from it.
Enjoyment - I don’t usually cover enjoyment, but I feel like I should in this case because by the time I finished, my emotions toward this show were just so extreme. I tried to stay optimistic, I really did. I kept telling myself it will get better, as did my friend who told me to watch in the first place. Looking back I have no clue why I finished, but I did. Off of a false hope that the show would be good because, honestly, I don’t think I liked a single second of this show, EVER. What started as standard boredom turned into extreme dislike over the course of this show and it would’ve only happened sooner if I didn’t have that hope. Amongst me and my friends, this show has transcended the definition of bad and has just turned into a fucking joke. It is LITERALLY laughably bad. Like if someone called something horrible someone could say that at least it wasn’t Toradora or something like that.
I like to think that I missed something, maybe I didn’t pay enough attention and this show isn’t as bad as I think it is, but that has proven not true. I have tried to find what people like about it but all I get back is stuff like : “It gets development” then when I ask what development they never respond. Or maybe I’ll get, Taiga is cute, which I still can’t quite wrap my head around but hey, whatever floats your boat. Another one is people saying it’s funny which wouldn't even be a bad response, except that the comedy is unbelievably stale. It makes ""Friends"" look like a masterpiece. At this point I don’t think I missed anything, it’s just a shitty and extremely overrated show. In fact I’d argue the definition of. Thanks for reading! Hope this didn’t trigger anyone too badly :)
TAIGA IS THE WORST CHARACTER EVER MADE
(well unless it’s that)",1
"
                School life crushes. Back then for some you were either too shy to talk to them or no matter how hard you tried thing didn't go to plan. Others however manage to catch them. But regardless of the outcome and the happiness of now, one always looks back and smiles at them self at the memories their youth brought them.
Toradora has a story that is somewhat easy to predict at most points and at other times adds a small twist that's just enough to poke at your feels. However they story is somewhat flat for the large portion of the anime. It starts and rises
                  steady for the first few but then it pans out when all the characters are introduced and despite the little wavers it has at points, it still resolves in the same outcomes an episode or two later. It's not until the last quarter of the anime that the story really peaks up again and the line between romance and comedy becomes more apparent
Style of art could not be any more generic. The only things that stand out is the emotion and colour they give the faces when they express large amounts of affection and grief as well as the art used inside western style houses. Tones and gradients are well used to depict the scenery and really adds to the emotion of some moments while other times basic uses means it wouldn't matter the time of day, the character atmosphere would remain the same.
Sound works hand in hand with the art style in some areas and others, excels the scenes mood. While used mostly to add a scene of feel so the viewer has a bit more sense of emotion, other times it gives the scene the much need oomph to take a decent scene, into an interesting development, making you want to know where the anime is going.
Character development leaves you high and dry for the longest part of the anime. It plays through the past as a heavy need to know and only speaks of it, if the situation needs it. This leaves a lot of questions about the characters pasts. Then there's development within themselves which is actually well played out. While the story plays at a flat pace, everything that happens with the characters is reminisced upon when the latter part of the anime comes along and really shows just how far everyone has come with not only each others feelings, but how they truly feel about them selves
This leads to the enjoyment factor. It's a bit of an up and down ride as you find yourself bored at times but either a comedic scene that lasts or a dramatic addition keeps your interest peaked. Towards the end however it builds up on both feels and romance but it fails to juggle them both It end up having to drop one, so it goes full romance at a key point, leaving you expecting heavy feels but it does not deliver.",6
"
                Toradora has highs but too many lows tht makes the highs look pathetic
i started the show thinking it would be great and classic show tht would be slice of life and have me chilling thru 25 episodes
well this wasnt the case i never been more inflamed and confused in my life watching this show and it wasnt cause i didnt understand its poetic justice
its tht the poetic justice didnt make sense at times and was sorta written poorly
-First i wanna say is Ami and Minori held this show on their back 
Ami is the only person who has reasonable thinking capabilities with the best development
                  in the show and shows she can think about someone else other than herself and same with minori
the character we should truly feel for ...both of these characters truly are written well but the true problems lie within the MCs taiga and ryushi
-taiga and ryushi only have their insecurties and problems in common nothing more and didnt even have a substantial conversation without taiga calling him a dog or a mutt lmao least with minori he had a good convo with her 
 i believe tht the problems tht these characters face are relatable not the characters themselves
so let me explain this so there's no confusion and for this explanation imma use taiga and ryushi
Taiga is basically a bully tht believes she doesnt receive love from her family and thrives to one day find someone tht loves her and also an overgrown child tht only thinks about herself throughout the show
even tho the problems she faces such as facing reality, facing the truth and having a disfunctional family are all quite relatable the character herself is selfish throughout the whole story and does nothing for other ppl while hoping someone picks her off her feet... all  while shes bully the school in terror and some how gets more popular as she stays being a bully?? and has childish ambitions literally during christmas the girl was being nice so she could see santa not to be a better person lmao
And Ryushi is basically an OCD cleaning fatherly character tht cant make a decision for himself and gets told wht to do from someone he takes care of on the daily basis while his problem of self worth is relatable and how he doesnt want to be a burden to anyone the character himself isnt intriguing or relatable he literally doesnt think for himself but was a kid forced to make diffucult decisions and help around the house??? how does tht make any sense even kids like myself who grew up in similiar circumstances was forced to make decsions for myself so i learned thru time but ryushi doesnt learn thru 24 episodes (if tht still confuses anyone just shoot me a message)
^
now tht i got tht thing out of the way i wanna say something 
dependency is not LOVE!!!!! like running away was the first decision they made together lmao thts how you know tht relationship wasnt healthy
Taiga couldnt do anything for herself for 24 episodes and depended on ryushi like a dad instead of like a lover
the more ryushi acts like a dad the more she falls in love with him cause hes always there 
and ryushi feeling guilty tht taiga is always alone feels like hes the person thts meant to be the one by her side
taiga depends on everyone but herself to make her world go around and by episode 12 it felt like it was taiga pity fest and she was still being a bully lmao
like taiga doesnt even make ryushi a better person throughout the series
he actually gets rude and more selfish and more stupid lmao and still makes less decisions for himself
like and tht dragon and tiger analogy was so bad
rysuhi wasnt even actually a bully and tht nickname was used for one episode wasnt even explored enough to be referenced but the author thought it was poetic justice to squeeze it at the end??? LMAOOO HELLO??
the characters are all unique but tht doesnt make them good
taiga and ryushi are pretty bad characters and dont get me started on kishmaru
kids couldnt face they issues but thought they were ready to get married lmaoooo imma tell ya tht relationship shouldnt last but somehow its going to cause of writing 
how does a bully get more popular while still bullying lmao
these are the little things tht dont make sense and take away the poetic justice of the show not only did taiga ruin the show but the relationship between taiga and ryushi ruined it the second half just had forced overdone drama like for example
Minori seeing taiga say ryushis name when she was actually walking to the school in the oppposite direction lmao also taiga suddenly telling ryushi's best friend tht she likes ryushi but she doesnt want ppl to find out??? lmao dont make sense
ryushi liking taiga cause she liked him back was actually pretty bad thts called circumstantial convenience unlike taiga's it was explained and explored 
ryushi's just happened cause he heard taiga say i love ryushi 
and all of a sudden his feelings were dropped for minori and he wanted to marry taiga without having anything in common yall do realize this man says he loves her cause shes alone?? thts literally the words tht came out of his mouth lmao
just after the arc with her dad things really got out of hand the drama was forced and overdone and the love just felt like it wasnt love 
taiga herself says something like hes always been there for me when i needed him and thts why she fell in love with him cause shes never had someone like tht b4
dependency is not LOVE!!!
you cant even say she got better after she left we saw her for 12 secs saying some dumb analogy tht wasnt explored but the author thought he developed it enough to add it to the end???
you truly cant enjoy this unless you a hardcore anime fan tht likes tsuderes and dont know wht love really is 
overall i didnt even get into the hypocrisy tht is just way too much in this show and the kids dont even grow from it",1

Cons 
-Rom/Com in a school setting isn't anything unique -A Little Predicable At Times 
My Opinion   
This was one of the first Rom/Com's i watched and i can say i haven't watched many better than this one. Let me get this out of the way i love Tsundere females character leads and Aisaka, Taiga ticks all the boxes for me.Taiga is one of the funniest female characters iv seen, her interaction with the male lead Takasu, Ryuuji in some cases are just unbelievably funny and always kept you on your toes when watching this show. Takasu, Ryuuji character is just parallels with Taiga fantastically and the two just jel really well together to make for some really funny situations. Kushieda, Minori the best friend of Taiga is another really different funny character with a unique personalty that is always entertaining to watch and that feeling is consistent though out.  Yuusaku ""Maruo"" Kitamura, has some real interesting parts in the show and leads a little independent sub plot at times that was really entertaining to watch and didn't feel as if it was getting in the way of the main plot. Kawashima, Ami, the beautiful popular student that is always at ends with Taiga and from the start is sort of shown to be the 'bad guy' but as time goes out you start to feel attracted even to her as a lead character.
To sum up my view, This show pulled me and didn't let go till i finished watching it and even then i wanted more, they developed all the characters to the point at which i cared about them all and sorta wanted them all to end happy. Should you watch this show ? YES YES YES, like i said it isnt anything really new but it is still really well written and really entertaining to watch for me its a most. GO WATCH IT :P 
Hope my review was helpful

                In the vast array of mediocre high school anime, I find Toradora to be an exception and rather quite enjoyable. 
The characters are all likeble and all have their own insecurity. 
The art is pretty good too.
Story in my opinion was a really great love story between 2 high school students.
If you have to pick up one high school anime, Toradora is pretty much the one.

                *Sorry if this seems very not well written.*
In your typical shojo anime/manga, you have a girl and a boy. Sometimes they fall in love instantly and there would a bunch of problems at once to stop their love, almost Romeo and Juliet-esque. But Toradora is a breath of fresh air in the this world of anime and manga. 
Before watching this show, I was bored and hoping for a new anime. Something that would make me cry, ""OMG this is awesome!"" To cry of sadness and laugh so much that my stomach hurt like hell. This anime did just that.
Toradora is about your typical story,
                  guy likes a girl. but there is a twist, the guy is scared of the girl he likes, so he goes to her best friend to try get her to like him. sure that seems to work, except the girl's friend is very sly and gives a condition if she would help him, to help her get to his best friend. And that agreement, they go off and try to do that plan... all in while of hilarity and crazy friends. xD
But anyways, now to business.
Story: I think I incorporated that in my intro. like I said, a breath of fresh air to the shojo genre. crazy things and hilarity to resume all over the show, that made it awesome to watch and love.
Art: loved it. I loved the background and color, mostly the action parts. That girl could fight...
Sound: I loved the Opening songs and ending so much I have them in my Zune. I even liked the song sang during the Christmas episode.
Character: The characters are amazing. characters jeopardizing the plans and typical high school things. All the while of hilarity of crazy characters and events. The development is quite well shown by the end of the show. The romance between the main characters were well shown in the progress and at the end.
Enjoyment: If there was a movie or another season or anything surrounding it, I would go to the ends of the world to see it... That is how much I enjoyed seeing the show.
Overall: 
Toradora is the most hilarious anime I ever seen, there were so many times in that anime that I felt like I was about to die laughing. So guess what, I'm going to watch this again.

                ***SPOILERS N SHIT***
I'm routinely let down by poor endings. As a writer I know firsthand how difficult it is to conclude a story, particularly if you've become attached to all the characters. Do you want them to live happily ever after? Do you want to punish them for a character flaw? Do you want leave the audience guessing with an ambiguous ending so they can form their own mental picture? Or do you just fuck it all up because you clearly misjudged what drove your work in the first place.
That last one isn't a question because it's how Toradora!!!!!111! decided to do things. The writers
                  took generic characters, gave them enough personalities and quirks to keep even someone like me--who is not a fan of romcoms in the slightest--invested in the outcome, and weaved a clever up-and-down rollercoaster of emotions. The best part was that the ride transcended its high school setting and never seem tied to ""teenage years"" melodrama.
Well, until the last few episodes. Running away from home? Eloping? Enabling friends? Conveniently-away roommates/family? Convenient loving grandparents? Convenient unconcerned friends/parents/school officials/thefuckingpolice? Well, I could deal with all that. I was even considering this a 9/10 despite all that stupid crap because of how invested I was. And then the final episode rolled around.
I barely have the heart to talk about it. I could not be more frustrated. She expects him to just wait around while she selfishly runs away ""to deal with her own problems and become a stronger waman"" like a complete idiot? For various reasons I've seen more than my share of romcoms and this plot thread is repeated so often it's an actual cliche. And guess what? IT NEVER WORKS. It's ALWAYS stupid. It would have been better if the protagonist had broken his neck falling from the bridge, because at least that's interesting.
Oh, what could have been. Just like dating whores in high school instead of forging meaningful friendships, watching this anime was a mistake that I will regret. Mostly because of how good it should have been if the writers had been great instead of good.
On to the next disappointing anime.
PS. I really liked all the characters here, so if you're into that sort of thing it's still worth a watch. But if you want a satisfying ending that flows with the rest of the series just give up before you start.",3
"
                If I had to use just one word to describe this show, it would be ""predictable"".  If you've read or watch any Japanese school romance-type anime, novels, or manga then you'll be able to guess what happens by about episode 4.  That was the main let-down about this show since it had very few if any original or novel story elements that set it apart.  By about episode 20 I was struggling to watch the rest of the show since by this point there, was no surprises, or plot twists that I wasn't anticipating.  
The characters were overall quite interesting, but
                  just as how the story falls short on originality, the characters do as well.  Almost all of the elements of the characters have been done before on other anime's and each of the characters themselves aren't that deep. That said, the main character Ryuuji, and the palmtop tiger were the most enjoyable to watch and see them interact.  
Overall this show was fun to watch with plenty of comedy elements that will keep you laughing even if the plot is predictable.",7
"
                When it comes to romantic comedies, along with that drama, Toradora is your kind of anime. It perfectly, again, perfectly does everything I imagine a romantic comedy doing. The character development is outstanding, the plot is monumental it's overwhelming with you wanting more and more, heck even the unnecessary episodes are just as entertaining. The animation is fresh, clean, and serene the dialogue is detailed and well played, as you will never get lost no matter how tired you are from watching this anime all day and night. You'll always be looking for more Toradora, each episode is like eating something new, you'll never know
                  how it tastes until you finish it. I gotta say, it's short, romantic, comedic, dramatic all in the same. Toradora has won 10/10 OUTSTANDING ON EVERYTHING and earns my seal of approval, meaning it's a MUST WATCH!",10
"
                Now before marking this as unhelpful cause of my really low mark, hear me out. I like Toradora, It's a good anime, just.. there is some stuff that bugs me about it. Anyway, on with the review : 
Story 7/10 : So the story revolves around 2 characters, Aisaka Taiga, and Takasu Ryuuji, who both have a crush, Ryuuji's crush being Kushieda Minori and Taiga's being Kitamura Yuukasu. And so, after one encounter, begins their journey of helping each other to get their crush to like them. The story is well paced, and the originality is there, [POTENTIAL SPOILER] having a ""love square"" instead of
                  a triangle. The story is just generally well presented, nothing much to say here.
[SPOILER RANT-ISH EXPLANATION] : Now the reasons why I hate it. [SPOILER, DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS, SERIOUSLY] In the last episode the love between Ryuuji and Taiga develops even more. Their crushes are pretty much ok with them being together, they even kiss. Then Taiga runs away, for no reason at all (maybe something philosophical) and leaves this ""Harem""-esque ending. The story was built up, but then crashed down and left a cliffhanger. Yes I am salty about the ending, and that's my reason for a lower mark.
Art 8/10 :  Nothing particular or Revolutionary here. The art is good however.  
Sound 7/10 : The voice acting, as always is good. Taiga's voice is perfect for her character, same for all the other characters. The openings is what made this mark lower. They are, well, meh. I do not like them that much, I found myself just skipping them each time.
Character 6/10 : This is where, IN MY OPINION, this anime lacks. The only well done character is Taiga, being not a straight Tsundere, but a different kind, only having the violent side of a Tsundere. The rest however... not as good. Ryuuji : Classical ""badass"" MC (one of the other better done characters), really nothing special for him. Yasuko : the ""young mother"", I really felt weird about her, for example how is she that young if ryuuji is like 16. Kushieda : Classical tomboy with feelings, this character seemed poorly executed, as instead of character progression she had a complete change. 
Kitamura : The popular guy of the class, all the girls are his. He also was poorly executed, going from the popular guy to something strange in between. I can't really explain why he is poorly executed. Ami : I have no idea what this character is supposed to be. The popular idol girl? The weak inside girl? The mature person to look up to? She seemed to have too many purposes, thus making her bad. I could go on but it's pretty much the same everywhere. The anime would be better if the characters would be better developed.
Enjoyment 6/10 : Again, because of the last episode, I now dislike this anime. It was good to watch, but I kept questioning myself about the characters. Now this is purely my mark, you may like it, I don't.
Overall : 6/10 This is not a bad 6. The anime was overall ok, with a bit of flaws. But these little flaws really ruined the anime for me. This anime is actually really good according to to other people, this is plainly my opinion.
Sorry for making this a rant-ish review.",6
"
                In romantic animes from the begining we know who belong together and all we do is wait till the final scene comes, when They kiss in the rain or say ""I love you"" when it all sparkles.... I realy hate that, so when I found anime that was totally different then this, I named it one of my favs. Different - yet still the most romantic anime I've ever seen.
Which is Toradora, of course.
I was realy surprised by this anime. It's not a typical romance, yet so romantic... At first I liked it just for the art and realy interesting characters. The story was kinda
                  predictable, so I was just waiting for the expected scene, when they finally get what they want. And then - everything changed. I realy hate when producers ruin the anime, that had such a great begining, but this time anime becomes better and better with every episode.
And the scene, the ""final scene"", that actually is not in the end, but it's when they kiss, is also not predictable, not cheesy, realy original, romantic, simple maybe, but unforgettable somehow.... for that just one scene watching every single episode - worth it!:))",10
"
                the reason why i don't like romance genre is epitomized by this series here.
it's not because it's bad.
it's not because the story is poor.
it's not because the characters are flat or anything.
on the contrary, everything plotwise, and with regards to the development of its characters is  wonderfully thought of, the story never goes stale, and the characters draw you in precisely because of their dynamism.
Toradora!, a light novel series can be tagged as a 'slice of life' or romance genre. It begins and follows upon the stories of Takasu Ryuuji, once thought of as a delinquent because of stereotypism (his eyes look criminal compared
                  to those of his fellow classmates), Aisaka ""Palmtop Tiger"" Taiga, a diminutive tactless girl who ends up having their lives entangled because of a simple accident of Ryuuji discovering her obsession and her love of Kitamura, a fellow classmate and Takasu's best friend.
That said, Toradora draws you to it, sucks you in, so much so that you begin to think of your life with regards to the events of the series itself. As the series unfolds and the feelings each character has of each other develops, you can't help but feel an attachment to each of their individual stories. A scratch in this character here or that character there echoes into your own psyche. That powerful a series and that powerful a genre doesn't hold fit for me because it serves to give you a 'slice of life' through who the characters are and what they become. 
In essence, I fell in love with the characters precisely because of their humanity, their vulnerability and their honest to goodness regard for their fellow classmates.
That said, this series is a masterpiece and is very well recommended.",9
"
                What really makes Toradora in my opinion the best romantic comedy out there is that it gets what Romance actually is. It's not something that you can put on a high pedastoll, love comes from the most unlikely of places, it can even be starring you right in the face.
For those of you who are dissapointed about the ending, it is basically said in the TITLE of the series itself. Toradora stands for Dragon X Taiga which are the meanings behind Ryuuji and Tagai's names. Plus as well if you go and look at all the hints from the two birds on the pole when
                  they are together or when they are not together to the fact that they can have a natrual conversation with each other and you can see how their relationship develops. Also look at how they act around each other compared to when they are around their crushes and in the beach house episode Taiga rubs Ryujji's back with her feet without either of them caring about it, plus she saids that when she is around Ryuuji it's like so what. To me that is more of a sign of love then anything else and the fact that they don't try to hide their true selves from each other at any point. To me that is the signs of true love and that's what I took away from Toardora. The idea that for it to be true love is that it has to be with someone you are completley comfortable and loves you for who are and not what you are trying to be or what others think of you.
To me like I said before Toaradora gets what a romantic comedy is suppose to be about. The characters, the relationships and showing a natrual progression of a relationship.",10
"
                After watching a lot of Romantic Comedy that always have a stupid male protagonist, annoying tsundere girl,and 1 million girls easily falling in love with the protagonist. I have finally found a great Rom-Com anime which doesn't have most of the cliches that I listed above. It's not a perfect Rom-Com anime but it's very close to being a perfect one. 
(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)
[Story]: (7/10) (SPOILERS)
The story is basically simple. Ryuuji goes to school, bumps into a girl, this girl hates his guts, he gains feeling for him later on in the series then you pretty much know what's going
                  to happen and who the male protagonist is going to end up with.
The story in my opinion, is good but not great. The show uses comedy most of the times to escape the weak plot and I guess it worked. However, the plot became  somewhat stronger in the last 5 or 6 episodes of the series. By the way, I'm not saying that the show had a stupid plot. I just thought it was weak. There were some strong plot but there aren't a lot. The show still has a good story but not the very best. 
Uggh, the melodramatic moments. It just became annoying. I'm not saying all dramatic moments were annoying but there are scenes that I found annoying like Minori and Ami fighting or where Yuusaka broke down in a state of depression. How about that scene where Taiga (or was it Ryuuji who said that) said ""let's get married"" out of the water(They were in the water at this scene so no pun intended). I literally facepalmed so hard. Dramatic moments is not really the show's strength to begin with. The comedy does make up for the weak(but good) plot and horrendous dramatic moments. This is, by far, one of the funniest animes I have ever seen. It doesn't always resort to cheap violent moments just to make us laugh because the show also uses other tactics to make the viewers laugh.
The pacing of the show is kind of slow but that didn't really bother me because I'm used to slow story pacing anime. If you make it past the 20 episodes then the last 5 episodes will be rewarding. 
The series ended on a satisfying note. I'm not saying it's a great ending but it's at least satisfying to me. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Art/Animation]: (8/10)
The animation is beautiful and colorful but wasn't expecting better since this is from J.C Staff. The character designs are well drawn and they also look glorious. The character motions are ok and the ""girl fight scenes"" are fluid. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Sound]: (9/10)
I absolutely love the soundtrack for this show. The background themes fit so well with the ""slice of life"" and ""rom-com"" theme. There are 2 OP and 2 ED used for this show. I thought the 1st OP is ok but the 2nd opening is better. I can't give out my thoughts on the ED since I just skip them and watch the preview. I watched the show in Eng. Dub so I'm going to give my thoughts on the English VA. They all did a terrific job with their characters and their voice fitted so well. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Characters]: (9.5/10)
Ohh, the characters. One of the show's main strong point. This is one of the reasons why I love this show. The character's are not stereotyped and they don't usually play their tropes at all. In other words, their actions are somewhat unpredictable.
The main protagonist of the show, Ryuuji, is not your typical annoying brain-dead main protagonist that you see mostly in Rom-Coms today. He's actually a likable character with likable personalities and he's also smart (Thank God). Taiga, a likable tsundere character of the show, may be annoying at the start but she starts to show her redeeming qualities later in the series. Kitamura, a friend of Ryuuji. At first, I thought that Kitamura is just going to be thrown aside while Ryuuji gets all the girls but thank god that didn't happen. The show sometimes focuses on him, giving him a character development. Minori, a cheerful high school girl. What I like about her is even though she's going through tough times, she faces it and gets through it instead of complaining. I wanted to save Ami for last because she's now one of my favorite characters. Ami is a teenage modelling girl that transferred to Ryuuji's school for reasons that I don't want to list because of spoilers. One of the reasons why the show is funny is because of Ami. She makes up 80% of the show's comedy.(I came up with this percentage and is not accurate). Hell, she even points out the cheesy drama moments that these characters are going through and she likes to break her trope a lot. 
All of the characters got a character development. Even the side cast. Well, not a lot but still. They didn't get thrown aside like some useless characters. As you watch the show, you'll see how the characters changed from the start of the series to the end of the series. Especially Ryuuji, Taiga.....You know what? All the main characters changed from start to end. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Enjoyment]: (10/10)
Easily a perfect score from me. I enjoyed this show from start to finish. The jokes weren't being re-used, the characters are likable, the show is hilarious as hell. What more do you need? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OVERALL]: (9/10)
This is one of, if not, the best Romantic Comedy Anime out there. While the show does suffer from melodramatic moments, the show also has a lot of great moments like a good story, a new and fleshed out characters, likable characters, and extreme hilarious moments. The show is obviously not for everyone so if you're not a fan of Rom-Com anime or you don't have a sense of humor then don't watch this show. If you're one of the above then give this show a try and I'm positive that you'll fall in love with the show, no pun intended. 
Pros:
+Good story
+Great Animation
+Great Soundtrack
+A lot of funny moments
+Jokes aren't re-used
+Likable fleshed out characters with great character development
Cons:
-Slow pacing
-Melodramatic moments",9
"
                Story: 7
At least this anime had a story, but it is a very cliche one. I could guess what happens, even withot finishing it. Tsundere and scary looking guy. They both like a guy and a girl. While helping each other out, they end up liking each other, meanwhile, their former crush likes them. That may not be spot on, but im guessing thats what happens.
Art:8 
It was pretty decent. I liked it.
Characters:7
I personally hated Taiga. She was annoying, and well, I just hate tsunderes in general.
I didnt care much for ryuji and minorin. I did however, like Ami. She shows the human flaws. She
                  looks prerty and nice on the outside, but shes not om the inside. Eventually, she does become caring though.
Overall:6
I didnt hate the anime. I just didnt care about it enough. Some character irritated me , and the plot was cliche and predictable. Dont get me wrong, it wasnt bad. If you like romance with a bit of action, go for it.",6
"
                What is it that draws one towards the most unlikely of relationships?  Is it the ""underdog"" qualities, where one desires to see the more ""unfortunate"" character have something wonderful happen to him/her?  Or would it be more along the lines that a ""perfect"" couple is just plain boring and those unlikely pairs are just fantastic to watch, making for an amazing story?
Toradora introduces itself into the romantic comedy genre in a method where the two unlikely characters start off by liking the other's best friend.  However, the progress of each character with their personal love interest proves to be both entertaining and
                  relatable.  The story begins with Ryuuji Takasu accidentally finding the confession letter of Taiga Aisaka, intended to be given to Yuusaku Kitamura (Ryuuji's best friend).  Taiga storms Ryuuji's room with a wooden sword, but Ryuuji reveals that he has a huge crush on Minori Kusheida (Taiga's best friend).  Both decide to help each other in this odd little love square, giving way to hilarity, mischief, drama and of course, romance.  Combine that with the rest of a fantastic cast of characters and the result is a romantic-comedy quite unlike any other I have seen.  
When I began watching Toradora (just a month or so after its initial release), I soon caught up with the airing date and was checking daily for the subbed version's release.  That in itself should give away just how much I came to enjoy this wonderful show.  Typically I like to review in a very systematic process; giving individual scores to each category and totaling them up to give an overall score out of 50.  But I feel that if I left it at that, I would be leaving a lot untold about this great show.  So I will give a follow up after my categorical review, for those of you who want a synopsis of my review, or just the ""meat"" and the bottom line.
** STORY 10/10 **    
It takes several things to make a phenomenal story, such as an intriguing plot-line, a believable setting, characters and of course, conflict.  Sometimes, these components come together in such a way as to leave a tale that is worthy of being told and retold.  Toradora presents itself as one of these such tales, having all the workings of becoming one of my favorite stories.  Establishing itself as a school-slice-of-life with romantic, comedic and dramatic elements, the story progresses with quite a satisfying pace (save the last 2 episodes, 24 particularly, but that's another discussion entirely) and leaves the viewer desiring to know what happens next.  Each element of the story seems to be quite well balanced; comedic relief comes into play after a dramatic or tense moment to keep a light-hearted mood, the romance never seems too sappy or unrealistic (I'm sure you've seen those shows where the guy is surrounded by women who SOMEHOW just adore him without even knowing him) and generally speaking, each episode is truly enjoyable from start to finish.  As for the driving factors in the story's progression, the conflicts that show up are mostly internal, character-driven problems; those that you would expect in any typical classroom setting.  Ryuuji's single mom, Taiga's lack of parents even present in her life and the mere fact that their rooms are right next to each other give rise to many of the story's great problems and triumphs alike.  This has been, by far, one of my favorite, realistic story lines I've ever seen.  There were so many times that I felt like I could relate to any number of the characters that it felt as if I was watching a story based loosely on my own personal life.  
** ART  9/10 **
Now that an incredible story has been etched out and realized, what is the most efficient way to portray the events?  This is where the art comes in, as the medium in which the writers ""show"" how the story unfolds.  Ryuuji, with his ""scary, delinquent eyes"" is drawn really well.  Taiga is so cute throughout, Ami is pretty darn hot, and even the rest of the characters have their own unique appearance that lends to the believability of their personalities.  Each scene looks to be pretty well thought out and plenty of attention was paid to the details.  For the most part, art is one category that is hard to put words to, and instead must be experienced first-hand.
** SOUND 9/10 **
Another key component to presenting the story is the sound department, including all the music, ambiance, object noises and voice cast.  Music wise, there's not much to say; the opening/ending themes are interesting, nothing to write home about, but can't really complain either.  During the show there's appropriate use of background melodies, but again, I was never floored by a scene because of some fantastic music.  Ambiance is spot on, many times a busy street sounds like one, the noise of cooking food, the sound of a street all sound pretty darn realistic and blend in smoothly.  Every object noise sounds like a live-sampled sound, in decent quality.  Doors, windows, footsteps even all sound great.  But the thing that pushes my score up to a 9/10 is the amazing voice-cast.  Each character is acted out incredibly well; emotions sound real, personalities even show up in the voices.  Again, sound is something that is hard to describe but must be heard and experienced.
** CHARACTER 10/10 **
If there were a category in which I could weight the score heavier, this would be it.  Characters are what sell an anime to me, along with the story.  I have a hard time watching shows in which the characters are hollow or empty, boring, or otherwise lack anything worth mentioning.  That being said, each an every character blew me away.  There doesn't ever seem to be a ""filler"" character; each one lends their part to the overall story and just ""fits.""  I almost guarantee you will find a character in which you relate to in some form.  Each one is well thought out, well planned and scripted extremely well.  Towards the end of the anime, lines from each character seem to fit with the personality they represent.  Several ""Yeah, you would do that"" moments appear, as the main characters are portrayed so well that you feel like you know them personally after a few episodes.  
** ENJOYMENT 10/10 **
Of all the categories I review, this area should be taken with the biggest grain of salt.  What I find awesome, someone else may find horrible.  
So, with that, I give this category a 10, simply because I liked spending the time watching this show.  I also began waiting (often times very impatiently) for the next episode to be released and subbed, immediately downloading and watching it (even if it was 4 in the morning).  After episode 16 (where I caught up with the airing date) I began to watch each episode twice; once on the release date (usually a Thursday night for me) and again on the following Thursday before the next one aired, just to catch myself up with the story.  I don't regret it one bit, I laughed, then laughed again when I saw it again, knowing it was coming.  I will most likely be watching this again in a few months time, just because it was that good.  Also, the ending is very satisfying.  I have seen many an anime ending that was very cliche or just plain... stupid.  Not so with Toradora.  I felt good after watching it; it really resolved itself and finished off strong.  (Last episode... freaking awesome scene in it... you know which one I'm talking about, or you will know when you see it).  
** OVERALL 48/50 **
A near flawless score from me, with art and sound being the only non-10 scores.  This is definitely one of my top-10 animes now.  Sure, several things could have made it better, but may have also taken away value from other aspects of the show.  
***** BOTTOM LINE *****  
Toradora is a very cute and enjoyable romantic-comedy, slice-of-life anime that is definitely a must see.  With a very satisfying and smooth pacing, there aren't too many dull moments, making this show very good for either a marathon viewing, or a slow, one-episode-a-week pace.  The incredible cast of characters are truly what brings life to this anime, giving a realistic and highly relatable experience.  Don't hesitate to spend the time watching all 25 episodes; you won't be disappointed!",9
"
                Toradora's not necessarily an oldie, but it is definitely a classic. If you like slice-of-life/school/romance animes with a hint of harem, then you MUST have this as a staple.
The story is great - the two reasons I can think of to complain is perhaps the beginning, where the railroad into the awkward relationship seemed a bit too weird, and the resolution, which seemed to be slightly too abrupt and then open-ended. Otherwise, never really breaks the suspension of disbelief at any time - one of the most natural animes I have seen in quite a long time. The producers managed to weave everything in quite
                  smoothly and develop things at just the pace so that it drags on enough to make you want more rather than hitting you in the face with 1501816 things. Quite deserving score of 9.
Art is very good. Cute things are cute, ecchi things are ecchi, pleasing and again, smooth to the eye and fits the anime well. But from now on I'll try to reserve 10s for masterpieces that I pause for 30 seconds to gape at, so this gets a very, very high 9.
Sound pretty much the same as above. OP 1 VERY nicely done, OP 2 not bad at all. ED 1 was great, not as good as OP 1, but better than ED 2. Again, high score of 9.
Slight, gentle humor was there, but you don't need the humor so much in the anime to enjoy it. Emotional enjoyment was over the top and depth was very very good for a mundane (that is, no ""beam of friendship"" or ""power of heart"" fantasy ending kind of thing) school anime. Toradora really knows how to get subtle messages and tensions across, as well as to showcase the abruptness and muddled nature of people. Half the talk/exposition of, say, Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu (both seasons), ten times the impact. Definitely a 10 for enjoyment.
The characters of Toradora by themselves would redeem the anime if nothing else was satisfactory - ridiculous cast of characters and depth, up to the point where I didn't know who I wanted to ship as couples and how until a month after I saw it. It's one of the few harems that are not only ridiculously good but also wielded EXCELLENTLY by the story. The protagonist acts pretty well  - he's not so much STUPID (unlike many other characters) as much as he is in denial of a lot of things (or sometimes he denies himself...) The other characters are also very heartwarming, especially when their mini-mini-stories get unfolded. Finally, the harem itself is ridiculous - there's a reason why Toradora couple shippings are very even relative to other animes (e.g. Rosario+Vampire is mainly taken over by Inner Moka and Mizore fans). Taiga is self-explanatory as a Tsundere Wonder, but Minorin, as the genki-but-not-so-shallow-selfless-girl, and Ami, as the deep, plot-moving girl that so many people (including myself) want to ship with the main character, don't give any ground in the story. In fact, Toradora ep. 14 is an episode that by itself, boots the anime into a whole new level just by developing the relationships as they would work out in real life. This is how nicely the characters are set up. As much as we'll rage on not getting our pairing because of the stupid canon, nobody can deny the quality of any of the characters. Gets an easy 10.
It was very moving - hardships without undergoing something ridiculous like a car accident, love tensions you would have a hard time cutting with a knife WITHOUT an entire episode of something stupid like the main character being witnessed holding hands, and a warmth that comes not from some fake cheery high-five ambiguous harem good ending, but because of the nature of how the characters are and how they're brought together. Definitely a 10 in my book, and it should definitely be  watched at least once through.",10
"
                boy I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this one!
this anime is bad, there are roughly 3 character that are slightly interesting, Ami and Takasu and Taiga.
Kitamura and Minori are Boring as fuck, I couldn't care less about them and the show desperately wanted to make them relatable, Spoilers: They Failed!
at one point Kitamura goes full gay and dye his hair blonde! to make her crush to stay at school! Perfect Plan! after this master plan failed he tried Awkwardly to stop her from going by Begging her in front of everyone in a ceremony! also failed Big Surprise!! and he breaks through into
                  The MC's house! I mean what the hell is that!
and of course the star of the show! Kushieda Minori
she is the fakest person ever, she is fake to her friends she is fake to the audience and she is fake to herself! you can’t understand what the hell is it she wants, she desperately tries to show herself happy but secretly she is sad, this sounds like a character you usually root for right? Dead Wrong, her happy moments are SOO fake that it takes away everything with it, if she would appear normal in public i could root for her, because if you haven’t figured it out yet i love normal behaving people!
the comedy is really bad, Taiga hitting Takasu and calling him a Dog was funny the first couple of times then it's kinda... well not funny anymore
another problem is that Everyone is a Drama Queen! and confessions are so cheesy I wanna die! (except for Taiga and Takasu)
now let's take a look at Takasu, the main character:
you know people are usually looking for smart ways to get people to do their work for them, so they study psychology and shit to manipulate others, guess how Taiga Manipulates Takasu to do her works, clean her room, buy her stuff and cook for her? NO take a wild guess!
That's right! she calls him a dog and treats him like one WAIT she doesn't! Because you usually don't hit a dog! and yet he kept remaining with her, Poor Ami, she was right to call him a Baka! the funniest part is in one episode he concludes that it was HER who where near her all this time! i swear i’m losing it!!! BAKA! she is only around you because YOU are chasing her around!
and I don't think he understand that his mother is a prostitute otherwise he wouldn't be so indifferent about it!
*Spoilers
and of course the ending, they really tried to make us worry in episode 25 but we all knew it was bullshit and there is gonna be a happy ending, so Taiga suddenly choosing to transfer herself -(even though a day ago she was ready to leave everything and everyone behind)- didn't make any sense and just turned this anime more crappy
*Spoilers
oh in case I didn't mention there is a creepy seizure disordered bird! that was not cute at all, I don't know why it is there do begin with, it's like the joke is writing itself!
this is a long anime to be honest, I was watching it with 1.5x speed from episode 15 forward!
in conclusion, if you are not a huge fan of romance maybe this anime isn't the best choice right now save it for later.",2
"
                Story (9): Because this anime is based off a light novel, the story of this is very well made. Everything that is essential in literature can be found in this anime. There is irony, foreshadowing, simile, and etc.
Art (8): The art in this anime does not look very realistic but at the same thing not too cartoon-ish. It was very well drawn and created, none of the scenes looked awkward like most anime have. All the scenes looked like it was natural, none of it was forced or just stiffly drawn.
Sound (9): Despite not have watched many animes, the voice actor for Taiga, I can
                  say I know quite well. I've watched quite a few anime which she appears in. I must say that she was a very nice choice for Taiga. Taiga is a tsundere character in this anime and in my opinion no one is better fit than her for her voice. Same with all the other voice actors in this anime. I don't think any of their voice were mismatched. I think they did a superb job with the voice coordination. Even the sound of effects were very well done. Most animes go half-assed and have some bad timings with the effects. Not this anime, I can see that they put a lot of effort into this production. 
Character (9): The characters in this anime, I must admit, the main protagonist is kind of cliche. So many manga have done a main character that appears to look like a delinquent but actually is not inside. The author tried to portray that looks can be deceiving. Although the characters in this anime may be a bit cliche, the combination is a never seen before.
Enjoyment (10): The only thing I can really say is that, this anime is just down right amazing. I may have not watched many animes but this is by far the best anime I have ever watched and possible the best I ever will watch. I have re-watched this anime over 4 times. Also let me say that, I am a male and I have cried in this anime. Every time I watch it this anime really touches me. If you have yet to watch this anime, I would strongly strongly recommend that you watch this anime.
Overall (10): A must watch anime.",10
"
                **As of Episode 15**
Toradora is an interesting show to watch. If you like comedy, slice of life, randomness, and wacky looking characters, it won't disappoint. It's a step-up from most comedy shows, and it's really well-told out plot makes it more fun to watch. Overall, it's fun and it's simple.
Story - 8.5/10 (B)
Being made fun of cause of your eyes is one thing, being the &quot;dog&quot; of an eccentric, mood-swinging, beastly &quot;Tiger&quot; is another. Well picture Ryuuji Takasu, a seemingly normal high schooler with a seemingly normal life. Then add in Taiga Aisaka, the person you would avoid meeting in a dark alley. Add in
                  Minori Kushieda, the work-a-holic who never seems to sweat, and add in Yuusaku Kitamura, the plain average braniac with a light side.
-----------------------------------------------
I can picture Toradora being an actual non-animated comedy series, because everything seems to fit. You have the perfect cast for such a show, add in a catchy theme song and add in some popular voice actors, and voila. This show really is something else, and i'm glad i can enjoy it so fully. There's a few little speed bumps, but you'll enjoy the wacky ride throughout this series.
Animation - 8.8/10 (B+)
The animation is really nothing special, considering it's a 2008 show, which means: high quality. But for Toradora, each episode has it's own meaning. I really enjoy watching the OP, considering all the animation that's put into just the intro. Overall, it's a normal-high rating for animation.
Sound - 7.8/10 (C+)
Other than the OP, &quot;Pre-Parade&quot;, most of the themes used are pretty standard, average. Not to say the BGM is horrid, it's just, standard. It's something you'd expect to hear in a comedy show, the &quot;Woops!&quot; kind of music when someone screws up, or the &quot;Pwned!&quot; kind of music when you get smacked from out of nowhere. 
Characters - 9.6/10 (A)
Toradora has an interesting cast of characters, considering there's only less than half a dozen of them. But each character has their ups and downs, sometimes it takes the actions of Taiga to make it known or sometimes it takes the persistence of Ryuuji to make it known. By first glance, you would think that Taiga is a tough troublemaker with family problems, but once you see ALL of her other sides, you'll tend to regret thinking that. Toradora's characters, at a glance, might seem just generic to be funny, but once you see this show, they have their opposites.
Enjoyment: 8.9/10 (B+)
Toradora is a great show if you're looking for any comedy shows. I really thought from the beginning that it would just be another comedy show with the funny characters and no plot, but i was mistaken. Everyone, you need to watch this show. Each episode makes you laugh, some make you scratch your head and some you go &quot;WTF?&quot;. Unless you don't like that kind of show preference, than this show is not for you. It's not a show that has to make sense, it's a comedy show. If a comedy show made sense, then it wouldn't be comedy. For Toradora, not making sense is one of it's biggest assets.
Overall: 8.7/10 (B+)
The Good: Wacky, lovable characters for a wacky, lovable show, the multiple attitudes of Taiga, the sheer creepiness of Ryuuji and the great animation that follows. Not a tear-jerker, but not a laughing fest either.
The Bad: There's a point where it gets too random to make any sense, some fanservice. Not enough background on Ryuuji or Taiga to come up with a strong idea of their past. Am getting really tired of Seiyuu's singing the OP/ED for this show.",8
"
                I went out on a limb in watching Toradora, as it isn't produced by really any company that I've familiar with and I assumed it would just be another light hearted school-set anime that'll lift my spirits, but I was wrong. Toradora is a heartwrenchingly adorable show that I'll carry throughout the rest of my life.
**Beware: Estrogen filled review**
In the first few episodes of Toradora, I was completely and utterly in love with every. single. character. I couldn't get enough of it. The characters' personalities were depicted so well through the dialogue and I felt as if I was really, personally getting to know each
                  one individually. So character development: 10
The DVD covers, posters, or any type of official media depicting Toradora truly doesn't do the art justice. The art was what kept me watching in the days where I felt like Toradora just might not be one of my favorite animes and change my life forever. 
Now for the story. The story was amazing. It wasn't some revolutionary idea or theme, a great life lesson, or even something comical that you could carry you throughout your life, but a story of the endurance of love through every day obstacles like a valiant flag waving in the air. As most women are, I'm extremely sappy and full of tears, but I think I spilled most of my eye-waterfalls during this show. It's hard to talk about it without spoiling the plot, but let's just say that every time I hear ""Orange""playing, I instantly start crying. The story beautifully demonstrated the ups and downs of not only romance, but life in general as it starts out very light and comic but gradually leans towards a heavy-hearted, 'have a tissuebox in your lap at all times' type of anime. 
Toradora is a light hearted, moe-ish anime with a heavy hearted theme in its depiction of a persistent, earnest love, unwavering in times of grief and will leave every viewer with a stamp on their heart of the Palm Top Tiger and her Dragon.",10
"
                Toradora: one of the best romantic comedies out there. I honestly didn't watch too many rom coms but after seeing this, I can confidently say that Toradora is one of my favorite shows of all time. No other show has truly emotionally impacted me and made me a better person. It is one of those shows that just simply made me smile, cry, and enjoy the ride.
Story [10/10]: Now the main component of any show is the story and Toradora does it right. It wasn't cliche or predictable, instead it was innovative and kept me on my toes. The protagonists Ryuji and Taiga rely on
                  each other to follow their own love interests. The pacing was pretty good, it did take a little while for the real romance to start but once it does, it warmed my heart. 
Art [9/10]: Because Toradora aired a few years ago the art and animation may not be perfect but it is still one of the better ones. The art was unique but it was very fitting for the theme of the show.
Sound [9/10]: The soundtrack is pretty amazing. I'll be honest, when I first heard the op, I didn't really like it but it truly grew on me. I love both ops/eds, they just seem to fit perfectly. The music during some of the scenes  really fit the mood and just made me feel for the characters so much more.
Characters [10/10]: The characters in Toradora are unique and make the show what it is. I loved all of the characters and the development they went through. You can truly feel the internal struggles that both Ryuji and Taiga had during the show. I grew attached to the characters. When they were sad I was devastated and when they were happy I was happy.
Enjoyment [10/10]: Toradora is a hell of a ride. I probably enjoyed this show more than any other rom com just because I grew so attached to the characters. Every single episode was enjoyable, it had a perfect mix of comedy and romance. It did give me the feels and made me want to cry but it also made me smile. I don't know what else to say but Toradora is one of my favorites.
Overall [10/10]: Toradora! is a true masterpiece. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in any romantic comedies. After finishing Toradora, it left me sad that it was over but satisfied with the ending. My new favorite show.",10
"
                Falling in love is never easy, and a lot of things tend to brought up that we may not have thought about before meeting someone we believe is our soulmate. What flaws do others find unappealing? What aspects of our appearance may seem ugly to others? Will they accept us for who we are and make minimal comments about our appearance? And so on and so forth. It isn't easy to look at ourselves and find all these flaws that we may have avoided facing or not thought about for so long, and it certainly isn't easy to find someone willing to endorse all these
                  flaws and love someone for who they are.
This is what Toradora revolves around; finding someone who couldn't care less how you look like and stares at all the flaws in a person's personality to love them for who they are. 
The story is very character-driven and largely focuses on Ryuuji, an extremely mature person who unfortunately looks way too much like a delinquent for his own good, and Taiga, an immature person who looks way too young for her own good. Their interactions are the driving force behind the show and work extremely well, although it certainly doesn't hint that way at the beginning (though certainly grows with time).
Story is mainly driven around the themes I mentioned previously and how do the various characters view them initially, conflict with one another over their various perspectives and ultimately grow up as the show continues.
This adds a layer of maturity to the show, since not only do the characters accept their emotions and learn to be true to themselves, but also learn to face reality and slowly but surely develop over the course of the show. No character remains underdeveloped and no character is as simple as they seem, as the various characters all change by the end of the show.
There is a lot of subtlety in portraying their emotions, and this works extremely well in the show's more quiet moments. The show does become very dramatic at many points, but I never felt it was overblown and usually the characters have reasons for acting the way they do.
The soundtrack is solid, though doesn't have a lot of hearing value outside of the show with the exception of specific tracks. A particular mention needs to go to the track ""Lost my pieces"", which is one of my favorite tracks out of anime period. The voice acting is solid, and while I am no fan of Rie Kugimiya she certainly did a good job voicing Taiga here.
Both openings are exceptionally well-done and fit the mood of the show, but I found myself liking the second opening better than the first. The first is extremely catchy, sure, but I found the slow build up in the second opening until it goes full  to be much better done and much more lively to watch and better fitting the tone of the show. They're certainly great and I don't recall skipping either, so there's that.
The artwork is nice and consistent, but lacks the look that made it so distinct in the manga and the light novel illustrations. Characters are easily identifiable and the coloring looks great, but I couldn't help but feel (after I read the manga and took a look at the LN illustrations) that a lot of the charm in those character designs was lost when it made it to anime format. This is just a nitpick that bothered me well after I finished the show, but I can see why this wouldn't bother anyone else.
The animation quality is smooth and consistent, though not particularly amazing to look at but still filled with energy and movement. The background looks nice, and a lot of the motions have a lot of clear effort put into them. JC Staff put a lot of effort into this show, and it really shows.
While the drama does feel out of hand sometimes, I still think Toradora is a very charming series that is surprisingly mature and manages to wrap up all of its themes and characters extremely well. The characters are loveable and the story is well-paced, and I certainly am very fond of it and can say that it deserves most of its praise.
I greatly enjoyed Toradora and recommend it if you feel bored of the typical shoujo/shonen romance and want to watch something that follows many of the typical cliches, but has a very distinct identity of its own and manages to do everything very well.",9
"
                Toradora was one of those shows that I started watching on a whim. I was bored and didn't want to do anything particularly productive, so I did what so many of us do/have done: I scanned through a few shows at random and stopped at the first one I thought might be good. Toradora was a good pick in this particular situation because I felt like watching something lighthearted 
and fast-paced. And even though I've become somewhat jaded concerning the genre it belongs to, I decided to give it a try anyway. I assumed I would get some silly entertainment for the first episode, then
                  abandon the series, as that has happened with a large majority of the other slice-of-life/romantic comedy anime I have attempted to watch. But, as often is the case with 
assumptions, it was dead wrong.
As stated above, the only thing I thought going in to Toradora was that it would be lighthearted and fast-paced. Of course, I also hoped it would be funny, but I was expecting the majority of the ""humor"" to be in the same vein as the sexualized, fan-servicey garbage that is quickly becoming the mainstay of the anime industry. What I was not expecting was a hilarious, 
touching, dramatic anime which largely ignored the principle ""parts"" [forgive me] of its genre. (I say largely because they weren't totally ignored. *cough cough baka chi' cough*) I wasn't expecting a show that, paradoxically enough, seemed more mature because it had less ""mature"" content. I wasn't expecting characters that actually seemed relatable despite their strangeness. I wasn't expecting a conclusion that brought tears to my eyes. I guess what you could say is that I wasn't expecting most of what Toradora was. And for that I reason, I enjoyed it immensely.
I didn't want to write a description of the show into my review (you can read one of those anywhere), neither did I want to do an entire overview of the show (I hate novel-length reviews). I just wanted to give some general thoughts I had about Toradora in a succinct fashion to give the reader my point of view. So, in conclusion, this show didn't blow me away with its 
animation, it didn't wow me with its musical score, and it didn't make me contemplate the deeper aspects of the human struggle with its thought-provoking storyline. But what it did do was enough. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me want to think about it long enough to want to write this review. And by golly, that's gotta count for something.",8
"
                Toradora is romance drama anime about Ryuuji, a guy who seems to scare off his peers basically for no other apparent reason than his face being scary, who has a crush on Minori, a girl in his school. Thing is, school tsuntsun and Class-A bitch Taiga knows this, and basically coerces Ryuuji into being her ""slave"", lucky for her, because she can't really deal with her own problems. 
I will get my criticisms out of the way first. The story was pretty good and entertaining up until the last few episodes, which in my opinion were full on madness. Without spoiling the plot, the ending
                  did not feel just at all and bordered on full on ""what the hell is going on?"" lunacy. I know it's a high school setting, but Jesus Christ. Most of the characters seem to have been removed of development and logic in the last few episodes for the sake of advancing the plot and ultimately unsatisfying ending. It went from about an 8 to a 3 in the last few episodes. I was really hoping for a different ending, and they did it in a manner in which I felt angry with how they finished it, which does not help. The plot is quite gripping throughout the whole story,  though like I said, it does feel like character development is sacrificed towards the end for the sake of advancing it, in a really brutal, rough manner.
That said, the build up to it is really good. The one character who I thought was fantastic was Ami, she was the only one who had consistent character development and more depth than any of the other characters. The thing that kept me going throughout the last few episodes was her refreshing maturity and no-nonsense attitude. It's quite amazing really, since I grew from disliking her to becoming a favourite of mine by the end of the series, and in my opinion, she saved the show from becoming eyerollingly cliche. Ryuuji is your average Joe, kinda quiet, and it's hard to tell what he's really thinking most of the time. He's not too notable as protagonist. Taiga has serious anger issues and is a tsundere. I found myself disliking her more and more as the show went on, even though it feels like the writers intended the opposite. She seems usually to get her way one way or another and is bratty and spoiled throughout the whole series, so if you are not a fan of that trope, you may not enjoy this - I personally did not, but I have already mentioned why I enjoyed watching this. If you are heavily invested in the main characters, you may like the direction that the show takes. I personally had a hard time connecting with them.
The art and the music are good, the soundtrack in particular is very nice and complements the story.
It is pretty comedic and lighthearted, particularly the first half. I don't think I found myself laughing out loud very much, but smirking and a bit amused for sure.
I hope my criticisms do not scare away people from watching this; I think it is still very much worth watching. Just focus on the journey, not the destination.
Final Verdict: 7/10",7
"
                I really just could not enjoy this anime. I'm not usually one to watch romcoms but I was open to the idea after all the good things I heard. It was truly disappointing. 
I could not enjoy the characters, the story was pretty bad (in my opinion) and it just was not enjoyable whatsoever. Taiga is such an annoying and violent character that it is hard to connect with her in moments where you are meant to. When it comes to Ryuji, he is just a boring character. Not necessarily bad but far from good. The other 3 main characters were somehow more interesting than
                  the main two protagonists, but even they weren't that great. 
It felt like a chore to try to finish it. Overall the worst anime that I have laid my eyes upon.",1
"
                How many anime are there that are about a couple of high school kids falling in love? The reason why there are so many of these anime is that the setting has a lot of potential for a good story. Still, after a while of watching these stories, they tend to grow rather stale. And that's when an anime like Toradora comes around to liven things up again!
 The story of Toradora starts out pretty simple. Our main protagonists have a crush on each other's best friend. They discover this fact and pledge to help each other with their respective crushes. Aside from general character
                  building, that's pretty much it. I can tell you that right after I watched the first episode, I had a very sure fire prediction about what was going to happen by the end show. Whether I was right or wrong is irrelevant. What is relevant is that I was always hanging by the edge of my seat to see what happened in the next episode. 
 The success of Toradora's story was built upon the strong foundation of its characters. My favorite thing about Toradora is how it's characters just refuse to conform to common tropes. I wouldn't say everyone is completely realistic, but they all have just enough unique characteristics to define themselves with. Also, there aren't any characters that are ""perfect."" Each of them has their own faults and insecurities. However, aside from the main five cast members you see in the opening sequence, most everyone else is kind of forgettable. 
 Speaking of the big five characters in Toradora, we have:
 1. Ryuugi Takasu, an intimidating young man with a talent for various kinds of housework. 
 2. Taiga Aisaka, a cute and clumsy girl who has a tendency to lash out at others.
 3. Ami Kawashima, a teen model who pretends to be airheaded, although she is actually quite arrogant.
 4. Minori Kushieda, a cheerful and athletic girl who is also the best friend of Taiga. 
 5. Yuusaku Kitamura, the vice-president of the student council who is also the best friend of Ryuugi.
 As you have probably put together by now, Ryuugi likes Minori and Taiga likes Yuusaku, and Ryuugi and Taiga make up our special love alliance. 
 Each character takes a few episodes down the line to develop, but the story of Toradora isn't ever focused on just one particular character. The relationship between everyone is always developing, it’s just that the characters take turns to flesh out their backstory.
 About the sound and animation in Toradora, there is nothing wrong going on. However, I was a bit disappointed with character designs. Having two girls with the same face and different hair colors doesn't exactly speak creativity. Also, my favorite track was actually the opening theme, and then they changed it about halfway through the show. 
 Time for some final thoughts on Toradora. Firstly, I think that if you plan on watching it, you should decide beforehand to watch the whole thing. It’s not the kind of anime that can be judged until you have finished it. About eight or nine episodes into it, I thought of Toradora as a funny high school sitcom. Turned out, I was very wrong. Also, I think that Toradora is a great access point for getting into the slice-of-life genre. It spends some time tugging onto your heart strings, but nothing overly strenuous. I spent more time laughing than anything else when I was watching it.
 Final Verdict: Toradora is pleasant, funny, and entertaining. You can watch it to have a good time with friends, have an enjoyable evening, or maybe just to see a touching teen romance. And if you're looking for a way to get into a new genre of anime, Toradora is a great place to start with!",9
"
                *Includes spoilers*
Ahhhh Toradora - what can I say about this series? I really must hold myself back or else I would be shouting already how aweseome it is and how you should go and watch it if you haven't already.
But let me tell you a tale of how I fell in love with this series.
I still remember the day (well 2 days in fact) that I watched it - it was around 5 years ago and I picked this series that someone told me was quite interesting. 
So after I came from work I gave it a try - and I watched more than half
                  of it in one sitting. The only reason I didn't finish it outright was that I had to wake up early for work the next day.
So from that you can already tell I love it. But why? Well let's see:
Story - I was really satisfied with how the story went. I did have my expectations and they were reached well and beyond. A story about two people helping each other to get get the person they love. And while doing so they fall in love with each other. You might say it's not original - and I may agree. But the idea doesn't always have to be fresh and new - it's enough that the execution is proper - and for me it's flawless here.
Art - I'm not very good in judging art but apart from some stories that really focus on art as a means for ART (byosoku and the like) it's really good.
Sound - sufice to say I have included soundtrack (at least some of it) from this series to my regular playlists. I'm even writing this review while listening to ""Lost My Pieces"" so let it be the testimony to how I liked it.
Characters are a really REALLY strong point for me here. I liked allmost everyone (and that doesn't happen often). I liked how they interacted with each other and I liked how they looked after another. This is something I haven't seen before. When most anime would botch it with some silly excuse, Toradora would surprise me with incredibly mature and real-life version.
Taiga is a tsundere - and I hate tsundere... for the most part. This is one of the veeeeery few series when I actually enjoyed the tsundere part.
Ryuuji is the kind of guy you can depend on even if he makes mistakes sometimes.
Those are the mains, what about the supporting cast then? I enjoyed them just as much if not more. The way they act and advance the story is really unique given what I have seen in anime so far. I was very positively surprised the first time I saw it and even to this day I still think that many anime don't even get close to what Toradora did.
Enjoyement - I shouldn't even type anything in this section since I can't pinpoint what exactly I enjoyed. Why? Because it would be hard to find something I didn't. To be honest - this series is not perfect. But then again - I have never ever seen a series that would be perfect. This however is as close as it can get. Even if I didn't like something that happened - the anime would quickly show me something I enjoyed so much that I would quickly forget about what was it that I didn't like.
5 years have passed. And even after this immense ammount of time I can still find myself thinking about how awesome this series is. And watchint clips from it that I have saved on my disc.
I have watched quite a lot of anime since I started doing so 8 years ago. And after all this time when I was thinking back about the series that I have watched I new I need to lower some of the scores that I have given. But this one? I have given it a 10 when I first watched it and I would give it a 10 even now.
This truly is in my TOP 3 of the BEST anime I have ever seen and if you haven't seen it yet... what are you waiting for?",10
"
                Even if you don't like the romance genre you'll still get hooked up in this anime.
Why? because Toradora not only shows you the sweet romance that every shoujo fans yearn for but it also gives you the reality of love. Like what I stated in my previous review I really like the slice of life genre, this may be biased but Toradora has high pretty stats, many people also liked the show and placed it in their favourites and i'm not ashamed to say that i'm one of them cause Toradora is the bomb!
Story & Character (10/10):
Life doesn't go the way you always want it
                  to be.
No that is not a quote from Toradora but that phrase almost explains 'quarter' of the story.
Now why 10/10? I'll be honest I watched this around early 2013 and I just halted it on episode 2 cause I thought ""Ahh this will be another one of those romance comedy anime."" and just like that i haven't touched Toradora for a year but one of my friends kept telling me that this show is awesome, I didn't give in at first because I thought that the story will be pretty boring.
Later did I find out I was wrong, sure we have this two characters that'll be obvious that they'll end up together and we are just watching to see 'how' and the story also progress slower but patience is key but when you get farther and farther in the series it starts showing a deeper meaning to it that this is not your typical romance comedy anime. It's like the show itself is picking up rocks to throw at you just to show you that ""you're wrong"".
Every episode just interested me, the development of the characters are amazing, each and every character has their own story and even though they're annoyed at times you will get to love them. This just gives you the 'love life' that teenagers maybe experiencing trying to get their 'senpai' to notice them.
The also show swayed around my heart and managed to mess with my feels. It has its ups and downs and laughter and realization with a mesh of sadness. It's not a predictable show, excluding the part that it'll be predictable once you do an analysis in each and every episode.
I wont go on telling why the art, sound and enjoyment cause it's obvious that they're outstanding to me.
Overall (10/10):
I'll end with saying Toradora is an excellent portrayal of human emotions, it just speaks through your soul. It really is a must watch series for anyone but mind you PG-13 guys wink wink",10

                I'm not really into romantic anime, but I have heard a lot of good things about ToraDora! so I thought why not give it a shot. I thought I would drop this anime after watching couple of episodes.  I've never been so wrong. The conclusion is, I love this anime. I love the characters, the plot, the comedy. This is the kind of romantic-comedy anime that you will never get tired of even after 3rd time watching it and it might make you cry for a hundredth time as well. 
-Taiga = her physical is small but not her heart and spirit, she cares
                  a lot about her friends even though she seems intimidating
-Ryuuji = has such scary eyes and that make people afraid of him but just like taiga, he's actually very nice and understanding.
-Ami = pretty, since she's a model. her character started a bit annoying and pretentious, but that's just how she is. she's that kind of girl who craved for attention but deep inside, she cares about others.
-yuusaku = he's got a cute nerd look going on. the only person who doesn't fear ryuuji's scary eyes. he's a very interesting character for sure.
-minori = two words, BESTFRIEND GOAL. she acts very kawaii, cares a lot about her best friend, Taiga. you will see how she sacrificed a lot for Taiga's happiness 
should others watch this anime ? Definitely. Oh and when you're closer to the ending, make sure to stay tune after the credits or you might want to punch the walls.",10

                Toradora was something I have been wanting to see done since I ever got into anime; a comedy that is realistic and funny, not needing to reach into the realms of ecchi, space and other anime craziness. Toradora was ACTUALLY funny on it's own, which was made possible by a cast with something else you don't usually get in your anime; original personality archtypes. All in all, a great surprise to me, seeing as I went into this series out of boredom expecting little from it.
Story; 8. Toradora, like all high school set anime, really doesn't have a shocking story; kids grow up. growing up
                  sure is hard though! angst angst angst crush crush crush. And this show was no exception, however the character interactions and scenarios felt much more realistic than they are in many school series. There were not girls running underwear-clad through the halls, and no one ascended from space for the cultural festival that just happened to be full of student bunny girls. Everything that they went through in their daily motions was believable, and this allowed for fresh, entertaining humor to take place. This is the best comedic anime since Paniponi Dash easily, and this is a compliment, considering how much I loved PPD.
Art; 7. Sadly, the art was all over the place. I actually loved the character models. Taiga was perfect, Ryuji actually looked pretty cool in my opinion. Kushieda reminded me of Haruko (FLCL) in a good way, and overall the characters were all well drawn. But the art consistensy was absolutley terrible. Let's be honest here, I'm tossing Toradora in with Simoun now, because both series deserve much better art than they got, because they were both phenomenal. There were a handful of sequences that looked good, and stills too. But, especially in the shows middle, many scenes look thrown together; the climactic fight between Taiga and the Student Council President was terribly animated, which was a huge shame because they built up such great tension for it. Altogether the art is sub par, and could have been much better. Especially with JC Staff.
Sound; 8. Generic j-pop? check. Orchestra for teenage suffering? check. Terrible, cheesy synthed love themes for tender moments? check. Yeah, everything's there. Nothing special, but this could have been much worse (see: school rumble themes. jesus freakin' christ.)
Character; 9. The characters were the polish this story needed to outshine all the other titles in this genre the way it did. Taiga was an very hotheaded, and as a character she grew a ton from start to end. I really enjoyed her, and Ryuji as well. Kushieda was possibly my favorite character though, because I could relate best to her; also, the weirdness about her was entertaining and stayed within realistic boundries too, which I loved. She had hilarious careers too. Kitamura was the most badass student council member I've ever seen in anime, a good change from the expected geekiness. His antics were legitimatley entertaining, as was the hair dying segment something I've personally seen in school. And once again, the characters also work to make this feel so attainable, and that really gives it a great number of points for it's watchability. You can really get into it, and I totally dig that about it. Great characters.
Enjoyment/Overall; 8. Although the inconsistent art was annoying at times, Toradora was a very nice treat; I watched it much faster than planned, because I really wound up liking it. The great characters and ACTUAL comedy made it a really fun experience, and I absolutley reccomend this to anyone looking for good comedy. It's like a School Rumble that could actually happen.",8
"
                Toradora, plain and simple is the best Romantic Comedy your gonna find out there this day in age. It really is the standard that future shows in its genre should be compaired against. Its not a Harem, its not Eechi, its what a Romantic Comedy should be by any definition.
The story itself is orginal and fun and within the first 5 minutes you can tell this is something special. There is rarly if ever any point where you feel bored and it constantly keep pulling you in keeps you guessing whats gonna happen next.
The Art stands out as it's character designs are different from most
                  other anime out there, but like Code Geass or Gurren Lagann this becomes one of the coolest aspects of the show and the action (when it does appear) is mindblowing and beautiful by any standard.
Both Opening and Ending theme stand out and grab you from the get go. The music within the show itself works seemlessly to help develop the mood and drama unfolding before you.
All characters stand out for their orignallity. They all standout in that all of them have their own faults and weaknesses. The constant character development that happens from one episode to the next makes you connect with these characters on such an emotional level that really is hard to find in shows now adays.
Overall Toradora is extremely entertaining and is always a keeping you at the edge of your seat. One mite come across an anime of this class an quality only 2 or 3 times a year. I hope you enjoy Toradora as much as I have. This show truly is something that will be remembered for years to come.",9
"
                Let me tell you guys up front. I'm NOT a big fan of romance. Although I do enjoy slice-of-life or comedy anime, I tend to keep away from romantic dramas, if possible, since most tend to either drag on too much or melt under the pressure of trying to keep the story together. I really wouldn't have watched it had it not been for the nagging of my best friends. But I'm thankful to them because ultimately, I got to watch a pretty unique and enjoyable show. Now, to the review.
Unlike your typical romcom, the two main characters do not fall in love with either
                  immediately at the beginning of the story. In fact, the two have separate love interests of their own, and the romance between these two grow as the show progresses. The story is kinda predictable but, hey, aren't the main characters SUPPOSED to fall in love with each other? The pacing of the anime is really good for the most of the time. However the ending wasn't executed as well; it felt forced/rushed and was kinda annoying.
For a show that aired 6/7 years back, I have to say, the animation is quite good. It is visually very vibrant and consistent for the maximum of the show, although the proportions of the characters can be out of shape at times. The character art is nothing extraordinary, but neither is it average. 
Toradora has a really, really good sound-track. The background music, in most cases, sets an excellent mood for each sequence to take place. I found it pleasing to my ears and, at times, some even enthralled me. The openings and endings are also up-to-the-mark and you might find yourself humming them when you're not watching the show!
This is, without doubt, the highest point of the show. The writer makes a great attempt at making sure that each of the characters (starting from the protagonists to the low-screen-time supporting cast) get proper character development so that nothing feels 'rushed' (again, except for the ending). Toradora has a rich variety of characters, starting from the scary-looking-but-actually-gentle Ryuji Takasu to the two-faced Kawashima Ami to the smart-yet-childish Kitamura Yuusaku. No two characters have the same characteristics and, frankly, that is a big up for the show. 
Not trying to sound emo, but I feel Toradora is just one of those shows that will probably have some kind of impact on your life. It shows how complicated relationships can be, and it is always preferable to put a lot of thought before committing yourself romantically  to someone else. The show, in one word, is amazing and I would gladly recommend it to a fellow anime fan.

                Toradora! is a great school romance anime that really made me enjoy this genre a lot more.
STORY:
The story behind Toradora! is about a group of teens in highschool who develop relationships and friendships and discover who they really are throughout the show.  The story puts the characters in life like situations, and in response, the characters make realistic decisions tho these situations.  The main reason is it feels more realistic than most other animes.
ART:
The art is a bit lacking for when it was made; it's not the best of the best, but by no means is it bad.
SOUND:
The openings and closings are great.
                   They have an almost happy feeling which really mimics the show.  The voice acting is great, and there is not too many sounds in the show, which helps it stay realistic.
CHARACTER:
This is one of the best parts of the show.  The characters are very close to life like and really develop through the show.
ENJOYMENT:
As I said earlier, the show really made me love this genre of anime.  I am not that experienced with anime, but I definitely loved this show.
OVERALL:
All these things made the show awesome.  I would definitely recommend this show if you like this genre.  And even if you don't watch it anyway, it may surprise you.",9

                Toradora! Is one of the animes belonging to the romantic comedy genre that has gotten attention over the years. It has received much praise and acclaim since it's airing in 2008. And to be frank,I had a grand time watching this anime. So let's start with some flaws and get those out of the way. The series is heavily cliched in many areas(e.g school setting) though this didn't bother me too much. Secondly I found the beginning episodes to be a little....well unimpressive. Like aside from some good comedy,a decenct story and of course, the characters(we will get to that later). There was nothing that
                  special about the first part of the series. But now that that's out of the way let's talk about all of the good things this series did. First and arguably the biggest pro of this series is the characters. The characters are just....wow the characters are AMAZING. They are all genuinely interesting,well developed, and relatable. And once again these characters were good in the first part of the series, but then they just became GREAT characters in the second part. The same can go with the story, the story becomes progressively interesting as the series goes on. Things that did stay very consistent was the art,voice acting,and music. These aspects were all well done.The side characters were also exceptional and actually felt part of the plot. The latter part of the series also made great use of drama as well as comedy.So in conclusion Toradora! Is an anime that gets better, and better,and better, until it goes from a ok or good anime in the beginning to a great and special anime in the long run with a good story,amazing characters, a good comedy-drama balance, and consistently good art,voice acting,and music. This is why anyone who likes school life anime should check this out its worth it.",9
"
                TORADORA !! Words cannot describe how much I love this anime and how much of ann emotional impact it has left me with. I just HAD to write a review about this anime. This is a very underrated anime. An emotional impact literally bigger than this world. This is also the anime that got me into the school life anime section. I watched Clannad before it and to be honest a lot of it I found was pointless and draggede out and as a result I was a little bored with it and it's one of the most popular school lifes so my first impression
                  in this area wasn't very good. (Still a great anime Clannad, After Story was even better).
It's fantastic, brilliant, mind-blowing, surprising, emotional, dramatic and not to mention one of my PERSONAL favourite animes.. no shows of all time surpassing masterpieces such as deathnote and monster even! 
A lot of the people might be wondering why. Or how that's possible.
It is so incredibly and unimaginably beautiful and well put together. I have never connected into something like htis. And it's only 25 episodes! The ending of it was simply the best ending in anime for me except for maybe fmab. The part where they talk about 'love' in the end while takasu is running to the room with Taiga in it. Not to mention he has been waiting for her for 1 WHOLE YEAR. And he hasn't broken up with her. That's not the only reason though why I called it beautiful rest assure about that. SO many of the scenes are beautiful too.
It is also dramatic. The drama is not TOO much (YES!!!).It's just the right amount to make you cry your eyes out and not laugh about how stupidly cheesy it is.
The animation is SUPER awesome and after a while gives you a feel of EXTREME nostalgia. The music is very good too. Seriously once i finished it i had such a bond with it that i had to rewatch it!! So nostalgic.
For me it is very relatable too. A lot of troubles do come from love. But still like I mentioned it is kind of very feel-good too. I dont know how but i felt so happy and warm inside after watching it.
It is super entertaining from beginning to end. One of the main things that ruined clannad a little was that it was boring and pointless for a lot of the parts. Not that problem with Toradora. I enjoyed every episode so much. From the occasional comedy to the drama in some episodes to just the dialogue of the very awesome characters.
The characters are SO good. They are funny, smart, crazy, dumb or even stupid. All unique in their own way. I love them all SO much. 
IN CONCLUSION, I want more if this anime. I just want to see more of those EXTREMELY awesome toradora characters that i love so much. I dont care if the sequel or even movie or ova won't be as good i just want more kitamura, takasu, inko, ryuji, his mom, taiga, ami and minori. 
PLEASE PEOPLE WATCH IT !! Overall i give it a gazillion out of 10.
Well what can I say? This should be much higher.",10
"
                A perfect romance in comedy. A different, marvelous kind of sweet only an anime can deliver. A collection of gems, gold, and diamonds in the form of episodes fully wrapped into this anime, entitled Toradora, in which I don't even know the meaning!
== Story ==
The series is made of continued stories in every episode and there is a genius behind the idea between a delinquent and a wrongly accused one, and had the accused, Ryuuji, be kind, caring, and I assume, the perfect gentleman be entangled with the delinquent, Taiga, through their best friends, which each has a crush on. In which from the start
                  was just like infatuation, considering they know little about them but as the story developed did the bond, relationship between the involved. 
I find myself wanting for the next episode after the current just ended. Due to that I can never expect what they'd do, or generally, the development of the story, but it never comes up out of the blue, the surprise, since there are always hints here and there, that only the observant can pick up, and perhaps people with talents in picking match ups. I for one was kept guessing.
For me, the story was placed neatly and the ending, a genuine delight when all of them, the characters were not left out, and crossed in the exact, perfect connection in between.
== Art ==
The animators were not lazy. Winds, shadows, and all that contributes to a picture of reality is the mirror image portrayed in this series. The background characters, supporting characters where given some thought, considering the details given that match that of the leads, not to mention the individuality of their style.
== Sound ==
I was not a fan of the opening and ending songs, though they gave a feel of cuteness in their voices, the singer(s). But the soundtracks did have an impact, that added/boosted the drama or comedy or romance in the scenes. It was correctly and appropriately placed.
== Character ==
I will say that all of these characters are a bit shy and needs a threat to destroy the world until they'd be honest in their feelings. Ryuuji and Taiga has an incomplete set of parents, and so offer a setting of a real-life problems that infests planet earth.
Ryuuji  is the accused delinquent, wrongly though. He is I assume the dream man of most of the women in the multi-verse. he is thoughtful and caring, sometimes dull, which I think a necessary character for the lead. If not, this series would be considerably short. 
Taiga is a female delinquent, who don't know how to take care of herself, and needs help on most cases unless it be in the contest of strength. Understandably so if you get to know her family background. A fragile character but shows a tough shell on the outside, as we later know in the progressing of the story. I think she was designed to be an ideal for Ryuuji
Minori is the best friend of Taiga and where Ryuuji has a crush on. She's kind of weird. She is the sun, full of life, giver of life and has a healthy view in living, that influences those around her, and even snatch a heart or two, Ryuuji included, inescapably trapped in her web without her knowing.
Ami is a model. The popular beauty of the school. She had a bad character, but was included in the mix for an even more complicated web of love drama in the story
== Enjoyment ==
This was memorable and can be re-watched, possibly. Many should find this series easy to relate since it is in school, it does involve crushes, love, problems in studies, people, character, values, and family. Quite a mix that save little for people aloof from this most relatable series.
ps. a genius idea for a plot.
burp!",9
"
                First off this is not my genre of choice. Im a very blood and guts or ecchi and funny kind of guy.So needless to say I was against watching this show.Then it was like a drug, I could not stop watching it! I don't know what it is but this show.It just has a great way about it. From the first episode I was hooked.
The characters have a very real feel to them, which is a breath of fresh air compared to how many bland shows that are in the same genre as this one.It has a great mix of light hearted humor without being
                  cheesy,another plus for me,there were a lot of times I couldn't stop laughing at this show.
Theres very rarely a dull moment, not to say it is constantly all over the place,but I never felt bored watching this like I sometimes do other anime.All the characters are super likable,even the supporting one.
I don't know,what more to say other than don't be turned off by the fact that it might be a genre you are interested in.Give it a watch,and Im sure you will enjoy it.Heck it made my top list",10
"
                I really wanted to love Toradora! Honestly, I thought that it had all the ingredients of an anime that I would enjoy. Sadly, while the series started off good, it slowly faded into a mediocre show. 
The story follows Taiga and Ryuuji as they try to help each other with dating and other aspects of life. Unfortunately, this continues throughout most of the anime, even when it's clear what the ending will be from the very first episode. I think this was part of the reason I was so disappointed by Toradora! It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know what will happen to Taiga
                  and Ryuuji when the series finishes. The problem is that you don't get to seize that moment until much later on. A ton of the episodes feel like filler, especially a big chunk that deals with Taiga and a personal problem she's having, which is not ever resolved. This would've worked better as a series with 12 episodes instead of 25. 
The animation used for Toradora! is pretty good, but nothing special. It's just one of those things that works for this type of show. I was never blown away by the animation. The character designs suffered a bit due to this. In particular, I was hoping Taiga would be a bit more polished. Perhaps that's not the right word. JC Staff usually deliver when it comes to female characters, which is why I really enjoyed Aria and Shana so much. Here, Taiga looks plain. There's nothing really special about her. Maybe that's what JC Staff were aiming for. I just wished she had more of a flare or special quality to her design. 
As for sound, it was okay. The soundtrack used in the anime isn't memorable at all. The first OP used in the first half of the series was okay, at first, but I soon got very sick of it. The second OP, as well as the ED's played during the credits, were bad. 
I didn't really have a problem with Taiga. In fact, I quite liked her character It's Ryuuji that annoyed the hell out of me. As I said before, from the very first episode, you know exactly where things are going with each character. For the first half of the series, I had no real problems with Ryuuji. I just saw him as bland. Later on, I learned that he is not only bland, but also completely oblivious to to the world around him. Get ready to be pissed off during the second half of the series as Ryuuji becomes unaware about the wants and desires of other character around him. Sure, for some this might be fun to watch, but I was having none of it. 
Overall, I am quite disappointed by Toradora! I was hoping that since this was one of the highest rated productions by JC Staff that it would become one of my all time favorites. Sadly, due to the filler episodes, unsolved subplots, and Ryuuji, I can't say too many positive things about Toradora! It's a show that could've been truly amazing, but tried too hard to be an epic masterpiece.",6
"
                Toradora is definitely within my top three favorite animes. It, unlike many animes that I have had the pleasure in watching demonstrates school in all the ups and the downs.
It shows the viewer the hardships of your image and the hardships of coming over stereotypes. 
The thing that I liked about this anime is each character develops. This is, for lack of a better phrase, a coming of age anime. As everyone grows and people become more comfortable with one another, the truth sets in, and the guards are put down slowly, but surely. 
Evey character in this show could follow at least one stereotype
                  e.g ""air-head"", ""malcontent"", ""genius"", ""cheerful"" etc. But in this anime unlike others, you see there is more to them then what meets the eye. In some animes you only see the wrapper, but in this one you get to see the candy inside. 
The artwork that was used was well drawn and portrayed the characters very well. E.g: With Ryuuji, his cold, unfriendly looking eyes made you think that he looked like that of a delinquent, but at the same time something about his look made you know that he had a soft, supple underbelly.It, overall, went well with their start-off stereotypes. Not only that, the graphics and animation was overall well drawn. The characters had a certain complexity that made you want to continue watching and see what would happen. Even characters that you didn't expect to develop like Ya-chan (Yasuko - Ryuuji's mother) did in fact change towards the end.
Not only the complexity of the story and the characters, the thing that also made this anime so fun to watch was that it was comedic. Every episode had you laughing without fail and it even had you sympathetic or empathetic towards the characters. This anime drew a lot of emotion. Not only that, the metaphors they used like referring to the single star in the night sky and the ""do you believe in ghosts"" conversation were used beautifully and were very beautiful themselves. 
This anime showcases the depths you will go to for someone you love and the sacrifices you will make. Very realistic in a sense, but also a dream-like fantasy.
Highly recommended for those of you who haven't already watched. Trust me, its not time wasted. It is one of the most enjoyable animes I have seen, and now when searching for a new anime, I think, ""need to find something thats better than Toradora!."" I haven't really yet, though.",9
"
                I love the story, love the character, love the ending. I'd recommend for sure. I rewatched the anime after a while and it revives the same feelings over and again. The thrill in the moment, the way the plot unravels. It all kinda falls into place. The characters are pretty strong and none seem to be neglected in any way. They all have their part. It is an anime packed with emotion, not only because of the main characters, but the supporting characters also have their attributes. My favourite is Taiga, i sure relate with her character. Other than that Minorin is the next best.
                  I love Ryuuji in the way he ""turned out"" considering  he has had a bit of a not so normal childhood life!",9
"
                What can I say about Toradora? Well, it's one of favourite anime. The contrast between the characters are great, done amazingly. It was very spot-on and unique. This kind of anime are very common nowadays. I had watched this type many times, but mostly ended up so wrongly. So, well animated poorly and written poorly. 
Not much can be said for Ryuji Takasu, he is a normal, typical guy with a gentle personality. The unique thing about him, is his eyes that makes him look like an intimidating delinquent. This is quite common among Animes, mostly girls then guys, so he was a breath of
                  fresh air. Add in Taiga Aisaka. A Tsundere makes the show so much better! Her delicate appearance contrasts with her brutal personality. Before Toradora, all the female leads was basically damsels in distress that needs their 'boyfriends' help all the time, but Taiga was so new to me. 
I loved the show, and it will always be Number 1 in my Heart :)",10
"
                This is only the second review I have ever done. I will have to say that I had high expectations going into this series because of all the recommendations. I am here to say that it did not disappoint! Every episode is engaging with the right touch of comedy and romance. I became really attached to the characters by the end of the show, it was sad that it had to end. I recommend this show to anyone looking for a great anime! The romance between Taiga and Ryuuji is heartwarming and really touching. This show will go down as one of my all time
                  favorites, and I will remember it and rewatch it for years to come!",10
"
                After holding off from finishing this series for a very long time, I finally managed to finish off the Toradora series that everyone I know raves about. That being said I can see why a lot of people love this show, even with it’s  “too fast paced and really messy” ending. The strongest aspect to this show is, without a doubt, the characters. Well, to be more specific, it would probably be the at times complex interactions between the characters that really makes this show enjoyable. Their interactions really gives off a genuine sense of growth and a realistic charm to them, which I’ve
                  come to appreciate as I continued to watch the show. I had actually gone into this show expecting a rather normal high school romantic comedy, and ended up getting pleasantly surprised as the show went on. There are definitely flaws to Toradora, but it certainly isn’t anything that seriously changed my opinion of this show.
First off, I figured I should mention production quality and musical composition for this show. To be rather honest, the animation was pretty standard throughout the anime for the most part, though it did have it’s moments of greatness later on in the series. Same for the music, though the series did have some very catchy and suitable OP and ED themes, such as “Pre-Parade” and “Vanilla Salt”, which complemented the show rather well. I’m personally more of a fan of Vanilla Salt, but most of the OP and ED themes in this show were suited Toradora rather well.
The first half of the series is purely light-hearted comedy, and while this is nothing groundbreakingly original by any means, the first half of this series does an excellent job on fleshing out our entire main cast, with the adorable yet violent Palmtop Taiga, the cleanliness-obsessive Ryuuji, the goofy Minori, the lovestruck VP Kitamura, and the sly yet pretty Kawashima Ami. Through the first half we get a good understanding of the characters, and really gets you attached to them.
Each character started off rather generic, yet as the story progresses the characters continuously show us a more complex personality to each of them that really gets you wondering about the cast. The characters get some great yet subtle character development which creates a very intricate, yet fundamentally human tale at heart. There’s tons of romance floating around, with hidden feelings and emotions really complementing the overarching story.
I certainly appreciated how this show had a great cast of side characters, with characters like Ami and Minorin ending up with some intriguing stories of their own. While these two might have provided a good chunk of the comedy in this series, they both were great at complimenting both Taiga and Ryuuji. Ami was definitely the most perceptive, sly yet mature character in the series; seeing her watch over (and at times guide) the rest of the cast really gets you to appreciate the subtle maturity in a lot of her actions, though at times Ami acts out the inner child in herself as well. Minori, with her naive, dark, yet earnest attitude, is a compelling driving force in much of the major events in this series. The support cast were all very well written, and not to mention, they all got some pretty satisfying conclusions. I’ll go off on a tangent here and say I wish Ami got a happier ending; while her ending was nice, my inner Ami fanboy wishes that she got that “ideal ending” that everybody loves so much.
Either ways, when you start watching the much more drama heavy and complex final few episodes, you really end up strongly associating and sympathizing with the characters, which makes every little plot twist and major event leaving a big impact on you. Just based on the title of this show, it was completely obvious as who the main couple would be, but the way in which Toradora got there was totally unexpected, yet very well done; Kudos to the writer for this series for such a captivating finale to this show.
This series is not without it’s faults, though. While Toradora was generally very tasteful in how it handled it’s dramatic moments with subtlety, there were at times where the drama was crazy, especially towards the end with it’s absurd nonsensical stuff going on. But I guess that, in the end, “absurd nonsensical stuff” describes teenage love rather well, no? The finale was filled with absurd nonsensical events that really makes you scratch your head, but in an at times oddly satisfying way. There were story arcs that felt dangerously close to filler, but in the end they all served to develop our characters bit by bit.
In the end, Toradora is an example of your typical coming of age love story, but the show itself was made of some great parts, with it’s funny comedy, heartwrenching moments, subtle moments of love and longing, all packaged together in a lovely, yet slightly flawed anime that really helps you appreciate the beauty of imperfection; it’s the imperfection to each character that makes them so human, and creates a compelling story that keeps you captivated until the end.

P.S. Oh dang, I just read over my review and I feel like I’m raving too much about it. To sum up the entire review, it would be: typical story with some great execution, amazing cast of characters, with some imperfections here and there. Truly a charming little series.",9
"
                Toradora. What can I say exactly? To me personally it was an anime that was just done right. Everything felt right, everything felt good and everything worked. 
From the first look on the cover you can’t really infer much from it other than it probably is another anime set in a high school and five students in particular are important, because they are on the front cover. 
[Luckily for you, after meticulously researching (watching the series over and over) I have concluded that this anime is a shounen, harem series about a redhead tsundere who wants to bring justice (as well as embodying it) with
                  her trusty dude companion to down a blondy. Wait what? Wrong series? You sure? Shi--]
Even if you understand the name “Toradora” it still doesn’t really tell you that much. “Tora” being the Japanese word for tiger and “Dora” being a shortened form of the Japanese “Doragon” which as you can probably tell means dragon. 
However the fun starts once you break the cover and watch an episode or 2 or 5 or 10 or 25, because once you start, it’s not particularly easy to stop (first hand experience). 
Without further ado, let us begin. 
[If you can’t be “bovered” to read the entirety of this (essay) review (I don’t blame ya), go to the end and there’ll be a short TL;DR section. Baka. (jk jk)]
Art and Animation:
To be brutally honest, the art is SH- (jk jk).
To be brutally honest, I don’t know where to start this review, so might as well be alphabetically at this stage. Right, going to the nitty gritty, the art style and animation isn’t anything out of this world, but then again it doesn’t need to be. From the prospective of the environment that the series is set in (yet another high school), it’s pretty mundane and overused, hence it is fully justifiable; why go all out on making the generic high school (not the focal point of anime) looking like a f**king painting by Mashiro from Sakurasou, it wouldn’t make sense. That said, when the art and animation needs to be good, it is blooming fantastic. This is shown throughout the series on the character’s faces, and once they got that nailed down to a T, the rest of the anime just fitted in perfectly. Animation is great too, especially the subtle details on the character’s faces and body language, and how easily it can be used to infer their emotions and reaction to a situation. 
Soundtrack and Voice:
Alright on second thought, alphabetically suck, so we are going to jump ahead and come back to characters. 
The soundtrack can only be described as right. There music always compliments what is happening on screen and unlike a lot of other animes out there, Toradora’s soundtracks always feel fresh and add another layer of emotion and feeling. This is especially seen as some parts of the story where music takes more of the centre stage than the actual dialogue, and I can safely say that even without some of the dialogue, you can perfectly understand exactly what’s going through each of the character’s minds and the mood of the situation. Now, I would suggest that if you could, you should buy the entire OST for Toradora since it’s just beautiful and of course one of the more notable songs is “Lost my pieces” which alongside what you would have been witnessing on screen at the time that it’s playing,  you would have felt an unusual stuffiness in your chest and your vision blurring (not a heart attack). OPs and EDs are also noteworthy; catchy, eccentric and suits the anime well. Right what’s next?
Characters:
So development’s dead right? I mean who doesn’t want 1-dimensional soggy cardboard cut outs of the most clichéd animu tropes, am I right guys or am I right! I’m not right? Well thank f*ck for that, it’s good to see most of you are still sentient. 
If you like character development, then Toradora won’t disappoint you to say the least. As I have mentioned there are 5 main characters and a few more not so main characters, but the interesting and definitely one of this show’s strong points is the fact that by the end of 25 episodes, you’ll know their names and what they’re like pretty well and yes including the supporting cast (because hey guess what supporting characters are also important, without them, there would be no such thing as a main character).
Of course the main focus is going to be on the five I’ve already mentioned (they spent FIVE episodes on introducing the characters, now THAT’S dedication); now I won’t spoil any character at all, not even going to tell you their names, even though you probably know what their names are. Toradora’s development is subtle and big at the same time; subtle in the sense of going from episode to episode, you can’t really make out any change, but if you compare what the characters are like at the beginning versus the end, you would be shocked at how different they are. That said, it’s completely unfair to compare just the beginning and the end, since the entire journey is also very important. After saying this, I would recommend you watch the series at least twice, once to enjoy the story with no worries, and once more to witness the changes and development. 
Favourite Character: Obviously the short, pettanko girl, I stick true to my name.
Story:
Up till now I haven’t mentioned what exactly is Toradora in terms of genre. Well if you haven’t read the tags yet, Toradora is a romantic comedy. So right away you should know what to expect right? Nuh uh, this romantic comedy is not like any other. The story doesn’t exactly follow two people and their interactions as lovers/friends soon to become lovers. No, this series follows two people and their interactions as practically frienemies, and their love for another two completely different people. So already breaking convention. 
Obviously if you’ve seen the anime, what I’ve just said would be simplification beyond what is deemed acceptable. This anime is set in the basis of a romcom, but the actual message goes much MUCH deeper. 
Warning, may contain some “spoilers” (nothing from the actual anime, just the deeper meaning behind the anime, which I hope you want to enjoy and discover yourself and not read up on it prior to experiencing it. If you don’t know what I’m trying to say, go watch the anime first then come back to see if you agree with me).
Firstly, the anime explores is the idea of love itself, and its difference from the more common lust or obsession. Throughout the anime the main characters will think they are in “love” with a particular person but as the anime goes on they slowly realise what their true feelings are. It is this learning what love truly is for themselves and how they change/react in turn to it that is the real highlight of the series and one of the most unique portrayals of love as a concept than other romcoms. Because the show’s characters realise (eventually) that love itself is not simple as they thought (unlike most romcom animes) and is a mystery that only they can solve and the answer only applies to themselves, that makes this all a bit real since that’s how it works in this what we call reality too.
Secondly, the anime acknowledges the fact that love is not always what we associate with love. This can be seen during the first time the OP plays, “love is something that’s bittersweet”, this sentence basically sums up what I’m about to say. The anime acknowledges the fact that yes love is sweet like what we normally associate it with, but also it can hurt and in most cases, it will and does hurt both parties. But the anime the continues with this idea and shows to us that despite all the hardships, those who love each other stay together because they understand why sometimes it hurts and they become more appreciative of the time together that is sweet. 
Thirdly, the anime acknowledges the difficulty of forming a relationship. Many times, we have seen that two characters who aren't lover, aren't lovers, aren’t lovers and bang suddenly, lovers, lovers, lovers. Toradora acknowledges how untrue that really is. The anime depicts many aspects of what most people would have gone through during high school/any period of their life, liking someone but not knowing if the other person feels the same way or not knowing how to break it to them saying that you like them. Of course then you would try many different methods to try (emphasis on try) to tell them but most of the methods would end in disaster and your embarrassment; the anime depict these as well to horrific accuracy. 
I will stop myself here for now, but you get the idea. 
So the story is definitely a good one (such an understatement) and I feel like most people that want to watch it will enjoy it.
Okay here’s the TL;DR section for those who can’t be bothered.
Art and animation: 
Good mostly, Great the rest. The characters have the best facial expressions.
Soundtrack and voice: 
Music is catchy, emotional and played at the right times. The music significantly enhances the emotional events that you’ll experiencing. OPs and EDs are nice too. Voice acting is top notch.
Characters: 
Deep, multi-dimensional, and developed really well from start to finish. Each of them has more than meets the eye and the supporting characters aren’t left out either. 
Story:
Romcom by name but nothing standard. The story goes deep to explore many ideas about love and its meaning whilst giving you a lovely complex and developing storyline.
TL;DR over, continue to read the next sections.
Enjoyment:
Well, I gave it a 10/10 for a reason.
Although I would say one thing, if you don’t like tsunderes at all, like you can’t tolerate any sort of tsun and practically allergic and would require significant medical attention upon seeing anything tsun, I would suggest you take a step back and watch a girl with autism (I’m serious) and her beautiful love story in Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. 
But if you aren’t the sort of person I’ve described above, I would suggest you give it a go at least. If you make it to episode 10 and don’t like what you see, then I can’t blame you for dropping it.
If you are concerned about the tsundere, don’t be. The trope is what you can describe as tsundere, but it’s nothing like what you’ve seen before, it’s not repetitive and it adds to the story development as well as the character development. (The tsundere’s voice actor is really famous for her work, so that’s always reassuring.)
Overall:
Toradora is one of those animes you watch, you laugh, you cry, you laugh again, you smile and you remember. I have to say it’s something special not just as a romcom but as an anime in general. And oh my the ending.
Appendix A:
Thank you for reading everything I have to say, hopefully I have convinced you to watch the anime. Hopefully you found this review useful and happy viewing!
[See Appendix B for what to do after you finish the anime]
Appendix B:
Okay so if you are here I will assume you have finished the entire series at least once. Here are a couple of things I would recommend you doing if you wish to see more Toradora; 
0 – There’s an OVA, about bento lunches, so go ahead (#NotShokugekiNoSoma). Includes more character development! Yay!
1 – Didn’t like the ending of the anime? Want to ship the MC with one of the other girls? You can do that with the “Toradora! Portable” PSP game. You can purchase the game off Amazon and use either a PSP or an emulator to play it.
2 – Want to see the source material? Toradora is an adaptation of a light novel series, so you can always check those out if you want to see the story in its original detail, also there’s a manga too so, more money to spend!
3 – If you haven’t brought the OST, I would suggest doing so, since the music is varied, fun, and emotional, just like the anime.
4 – See Appendix C if finished all of the above.
Appendix C:
Okay no more material on the actual story and such, but merch is still a thing! Posters to stickers to figurines to plushies to body pillows, if you want to splurge then that’s what you could do!
If you are really desperate for more story, fan fiction is the next best thing I’m afraid.
(Doujins too if you are into that)",10

                If you're looking for a shoujo romance anime to watch that makes you want to throw up because it's so darn cute, this is for you. The main characters are hilarious, and not boring which makes their story very enjoyable to follow. I think it's one of the best anime in its genre out there, especially because of the drama towards the end. It may be typical of some shoujo animes in a way but it is certainly different in terms of the main characters; they have bold personalities and are very different in terms of teenagers. Go watch it now and be ready for
                  some laughs and major feels.",9
"
                Here i go, a review of my all time favorite anime, Toradora. I haven't seen this anime in a while so i apologize if it isn't so detailed.
 This show isn't amazing quality vise, it has a pretty good soundtrack, pretty nice art etc. But nothing really outstanding or amazing. 
The characters seems pretty standard at first, your whiny tsundere, the soulless main character and so on. 
It really does seem like a normal high school harem'ish anime, but they take it way past that. 
I hate when i'm watching an anime and you just know nothing is gonna happen as far as romance go.
                  This anime is not like that, and that's one of the reasons i love it so much. I thought they were gonna end it with a ""everyone's happy"" ending like most other anime's like this do, but it doesn't. I think this anime is all up to preference, some like it, some hate it. 
As a conclusion, this anime is not something special in terms of quality but i really enjoyed it. If you want a romance that doesn't end with holding hands this might be an anime for you! And omg it's so cute :).",9

                A decade later and still the high school romcom that all others are to be measured by.
Story: 8
Two classmates discover the other is in love with their best friend and they team up to set each other up. Nothing revolutionary for sure, but nonetheless an effective foundation for a good romcom. As the story progresses, you can see it turns into something else entirely, with just enough minor twists to prevent it from going to stale. It starts out pretty silly and light, but the drama does ratchet up a bit later in the series. Enough to get me emotionally invested in how it was
                  going to end. Overall for the genre the story is certainly above average, but don't expect to be wowed.
Art: 8
More or less what you'd expect from a decade-old romcom. It won't floor you but the character models are decent and definitely expressive.
Sound: 10
This is one of the few series I have watch in both subbed and dubbed in its entirety, and I will vouch for the quality of both. Taiga's Japanese VA, Rie Kugimiya, in particular stands out for what I consider the defining tsundere performance in anime. Both openings and endings are delightful, and the first OP is especially catchy.
Character: 10
What I consider the most important aspect of any show is where Toradora shines the brightest. Let's start with Ryuuji. One of my issues with a decent number of high school romcoms is the uninteresting male MCs. Ryuuji is an exception. Despite his (apparently) menacing face, he is actually a super sweet and likable guy with an affinity for cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping. Which is why some affectionately (I think) tease him with the moniker ""housewife"". Now on to the rest of the cast. We have Taiga, the tiny tsundere and Ryuuji's partner in crime. There's Minori, the athletic ""genki girl"", whom is the object of Ryuuji's affection. Then we got Kitamura, the bookish vice president and apple of Taiga's eye. And rounding out the main cast is Kitamura's childhood friend Ami, the worldly but initially two-faced model. Not only is it a colorful cast of characters, but the unique interactions between two specific characters, such as Taiga and Ami's bickering, or Minori and Taiga's strong affection for one another, are entertaining to watch. One of the themes of Toradora is a simple one, everyone to some degree wears a mask. Without getting too into spoiler territory, most of the characters in show are not exactly the person they seem to be at first blush.
Enjoyment: 10
I don't often rematch anime, but I enjoyed this one so much the first time in dub, that I decided to watch it again less than a year later in sub. It is consistently a joy to watch.
Overall: 10
I love the characters and the dynamics between them. I love the music. I love the goofiness. I love the serious moments that ensue later in the series. I love the show. It was my personal gateway drug to the romance genre in anime and I can't recommend it enough if you're at all interested in high school romcom anime.",10
"
                OMG!!
As a watcher of shounen to shojo, and all in between, Toradora is one of the best anime i have seen. The development of the characters from the first episode to the last is astounding. The twist of events and sudden (Gasp!) of the expected train of thought is what keeps me re-watching this show. 
All I can say is that this is a masterpiece that should be watched by everyone. 
^o^
              ",10
"
                I went into this expecting the average romance set-up or perhaps some slight deviation from it. In the end though Toradora blew that idea out of the water. It did nothing of the sort, at least not in my eyes. There are so many aspects of this show that I feel were done fantastically, especially in terms of character development, foreshadowing, and pacing. The whole cast is developed well, and I genuinely found myself attached to almost all of them by the end.  I really hate black and white characters and I didn't find that many in Toradora, which I can really appreciate. An
                  example of this would be Tiaga, who, despite looking like your average Tsundere on the surface, isn't like most other Tsunderes. She's not aggrsssive for the sake of being aggressive, and she's given actual reason to act the way she does. Toradora does rely on some cliffhangers, but considering all the episodes have been long-aired already this isn't a problem. The dubbed version to be found on crunchyroll is fantastic as well in my opinion, one of the better dubs. I ended up watching both, though I liked the original voice actors better because primarily they were closer to what was intended by the creators.
[Some spoilers ahead]
In all these regards alone this show impressed, but I feel like the underlying message is what I find to be the hi-light of the entire show. Both characters start out with their own crushes and repeatedly try and fail to confess to them, even when they basically manage it.. things just don't go to plan. They both don't quite understand these feelings they're having. They try and act as they believe they should according to these feelings.. but they aren't really sure how. They're naive. Right from the start it's immediately obvious that Taiga and Ryuuji are perfect for each-other, but they're so caught up in everything else and helping each-other pursue their crushes that they don't realize that the whole time their best friend was the perfect person for them, yet there the entire time. Everybody else sees this, the audience, their classmates, even their own crushes, but Taiga and Ryuuji don't realize their own affection until the very end. Their bodies know how they really feel before they even do. They feel conflicted and confused and Taiga even goes out of her way to try to hide these feelings. There's this disconnect between head and heart, something felt all too often in reality but seldom shown in anime romance, and the way the show handles this I absolutely beautiful. Most people generally hear or think of love as something destined, that you have a 'soul-mate' or somebody that you're meant to be with. Toradora just understands what love really is. A confusing mashup of feelings, both confusing and wonderful at the same time. That's why this is why Toradora absolutely has to be my favourite anime in terms of story and pacing so far (as of the 9th of November 2015). Yes, as a friend pointed out, it seems like any other rom-com on paper. What it's able to do, though, using proper pacing, character development, and writing is the closest thing to perfection I've seen, both in and out of anime. I can't recommend it enough if you're into romantic comedy animes and haven't finished this yet.",10
"
                Hmmm…let’s see….what do we have here, yet another anime romance / drama set in a high school setting…wow…this is sooo original (yawn)…well let’s watch a couple of episodes and see how crappy and un-original this is gonna be…..like all the rest of em..
After watching entire series...........
Damn….that was actually done really really well…..can’t believe I almost skipped this title..nice
Storyline
Toradora's story is a somewhat interesting romantic twist that revolves around two classmates Ryūji Takasu & Taiga Aisaka who are both (for different reasons) perceived as school delinquent’s.
After their initial and somewhat violent introduction the two soon find out that each of them have something very peculiar in
                  common. They both have a crush on each other’s best friends. However both characters cannot make any headway with their loved ones by their own means so they decide to become each other “wingmen” so to speak to help each other hook up with their best-friends.
What follows after this is a well-executed series that deals with a lot of the now overdone and predictable anime school themes such as love triangles, comedic-misunderstandings and family problems.
but guess what folks……….THIS SHOW HAS DONE ALL OF THESE THINGS THE RIGHT WAY……unlike the countless other school anime series that I will not name right now…cuz I’m lazy…and the list is too long
Animation
The animation for this series is brought to us by J.C. Staff who seem to be quite experienced with animating shows from a similar vein e.g. Bakuman, Honey and Clover, Ai Yori Aoshi etc.
With this series I am particularly impressed across the board with the animation style, most notably with the fluidity of character movements. For some reason the smoothness of this show stands out more than anything else as things just seem very crisp, vibrant and slick.
Character designs for Ryūji & Taiga are different than your typical stock anime characters and as such feel more unique. Supporting characters on the other hand do look un-original in terms of conception but are still animated very well.
Scenery and building designs are very good and I noticed no lack in detail when inside characters homes……quite impressive.
Lastly, the opening sequences are very cool and I found them enjoyable……not so much for the closing sequences…..not very memorable there
Sound
Another wasted opportunity…..urg…..sorry……let me elaborate
I watched the Japanese Dub with English subs for this series and found no real fault in anything there. Voice actors where good (Particularly Taiga & Minori). BGM is pretty good….nuttin spectacular and the same goes for the opening / closing sequences.
The missed opportunity statement I made earlier is in regards to the fact that this series HAS actually been licenced to the US however it was picked up by NIS America…..with NO NGLISH DUB!
This is extremely disappointing and slightly vexing for me because this show has some excellent dialogue and character interaction that would make it a fantastic English Dub - sadly thanks to NIS this will probably not happen until they lose the contract to Funimation….which may not ever happen……but let us wish upon a star
I really can’t express my disappointment with there being no English Dub for this series where other trash shows continue to be dubbed….something I have been mentioning more and more recently in my reviews for better anime shows
Anyhow…….I digress
Characters
I could go on about the characters for a while but to cut things short i’d say the thing that makes this show a cut above the rest is the personalities and interactions of the characters.
Although this is mostly a romance themed show you don’t get melodramatic or completely predictable character archetypes here. What you do get are characters that act more like real people making believable decisions.
Our two main characters Ryūji & Taiga for example are not what you’d usually expect from your main male/female anime leads…for one, they both look extremely aggressive and don’t get on particularly well with each other however, they are written in such a way that the story makes you interested in their humorous plans so ultimately you end up getting to watch a unique friendship blossom between these two unlikely characters.
Supporting characters also start off seemingly predictable as well but over time they reveal layers of depth and introspect that doesn’t betray the actual storyline and ultimately all the characters end up relating and understanding each other better over the course of the series.
When it’s all said and done, to be honest the cast of characters do not feel all that unique in terms of storytelling but it’s their believable actions and likeable personalities that make them feel more genuine and interesting to watch compared to similar characters in other anime series.
Enjoyment
I really REALLY enjoyed this show. It did almost everything perfectly in my opinion. The comedy was good but not over the top. The drama was believable and not melodramatic. The romance was charming and fun to watch. The characters were interesting and interacted well with each other and the overall story was excellent with a satisfying ending. There really isn’t much more I could have wanted from this series.
Value
This show is great…PERIOD. It has the highest of high value and to date is the best romance-drama anime I’ve seen.
If I had to nit-pick (which I almost always do) I would say off the bat, the first couople of episodes are pretty tame and may make people think this series is nothing special…well stick with it and I guarantee you will be rewarded.
Also I felt things got a little abrupt near the end of the show with some of the supporting characters in terms of the ultimate climax but in retrospect I think even that makes sense as there were undertones to those particular revelations in earlier episodes….so yeah…hardly any faults at all actually :oP
Sadly, the only thing that could have made this show even better for me would be a solid English Dub so I could re-watch it again and again in my native language…..but you know what, saying that DON’T LET THAT STOP YOU. This is a top notch anime title that sets the bar a lot higher in the midst of all the other mediocre carbon copy anime rom-coms / rom-dramas.
It’s Greatness…Simple As
This is how it should be done…with some genuine thought and care.

                [SPOILERS AHEAD]
""Roses are red,
Minori is a g,
Don't watch Toradora,
It sucks pp.""
What can I say, I had unbelievably high hopes for Toradora. I just looked at this show and I immediately wanted to watch this because it looked and seemed like a fresh and fun romance, that has its needed drama elements to keep it entertaining; yet it ended up being one of the biggest chores that I had ever had to watch. This ain't just gonna be a review my guy, this is gonna be a whole ass rant, so clench your butt-cheeks and prepare for this crappy lesson about how to mess up a
                  great show.
PLOT (simplified as hell):
Toradora bout Taiga and Ryuuji. They have crushes on the others best friend, so they try to set the other up wit they best friend and you can prob predict what happens next yadda, yadda, yadda-- sounds cool right? Next.
EPISODES 1-10 (estimate):
Toradora was everything I thought it was gonna be and more during the first 10 or so episodes. It was funny, entertaining, had intriguing and enjoyable characters (Taiga being my favorite, Ryuuji close 2nd).
Yeah, my complaint is not about Taiga as a character and how I think she's ""annoying and basic"", I throughly enjoyed her character and she was legitimately fun to watch. Adding on top of that, Ryuuji was also a character I throughly enjoyed, and Minori was a fun character with some of the best writing in the show.
I thoroughly enjoyed the hell out of all of this. I was telling my friends, family, and probably your uncle bout this show. My only wish was that Taiga and Ryuuji would have at least more than just like one good moment wit each other and thas it. How could you mess this up?
(8.5/10)
EPISODES 11-25 (also an estimate):
They messed it up.
(2/10)
PROBLEM #1: PLOTHOLES
No one really seems to point this out, but WHAT THE HELL IS THIS WRITING? There is just too much stuff in the 2nd half of the show that just flat out make zero sense. Stuff like introducing characters and placing them into an important role in the story, then the next second forgetting them completely, to randomly saying Taiga is moving, and then it doesn't happen, but then PLOT TWIST, she moves at that worse, most inconvenient, confusing part of the show called the ending. And people are praising this show for it's excellent writing? Either I'm braindead or there is some extra explaining that needs to be done.
PROBLEM #2: PACING
Arguably the most important thing to keeping a show entertaining is good pacing. When do we learn? When do we learn to not mess this shit up? Like man, how do you even compare the pacing to something? Hmmmm... lemme try putting it this way:
The pacing is slower than Shaq running (and not Lakers Shaq, I'm talkin present Shaq after a couple of donuts). Yeah, I said it. If you don't know how slow that is, let's say a turtle with a brick taped to its back is about as fast as Shaq running.
When the show goes from a great comedy with a excellent premise to a absolute disaster of a melodrama, the pacing takes a swan dive off Mt. Everest into the Earth's core. Just thinking about the pacing buts a bad taste in my mouth. I should say that yes, I am quite an impatient person, but this is just ridiculous. In a anime that focuses on the romance aspect, why the hell would you not focus on giving the characters more moments to let the watcher know: ""Hey, things are actually progressing!"". Of course, too much of this just makes the show annoying as well, but all they needed to do was put something on the table to keep the shitty melodrama watchable, and they just couldn't for some reason.
PROBLEM #3 (and the biggest): SUDDEN TONE SHIFT
Remember like 10 seconds ago when I was talking about the sudden switch to comedy to melodrama? Yeah, it's a pretty big problem.
It's not easy to describe the tone shift other than just saying it's sudden and makes the show just feel like filler in the 2nd half. And what does filler do? Make great shows less great It's just bad. I thought everyone knew that sudden changes are quite often one of the worst things you can do to a series. Getting an audience familiar to one thing and then just saying ""Scratch that, let's just start a whole new show with the same title"" (talkin to you SAO). It's not as bad as Sword Art Online's abysmal sudden tone/storyline shifts, but it's undoubtedly bad.
PROBLEM #4: THE ENDING
The ending is one of the worst and most confusing I've ever seen, without a doubt.
You know that feeling of working on something with a passion for a long period of time, just to lose all your progress and have to start it all over? That's how the ending to Toraboring is. Yep, you just watched 20+ episodes just to have it utterly ruined (for me even further ruined) in the last two episodes.
Wait, you're telling me there's people that actually like the ending to this show? I get it, like we all have our opinions, and that's fine, but for this? Man, I just don't know. It has been a minute since I've watched this show, but I still to this day have never understood why the hell the ending is the way it is.
CONCLUSION:
I don't like this show if you couldn't tell. My personal rating for it is a 2.5/10, but for the review, my rating is a bit higher, but I can't go much further than that. I really liked the characters, I thought the art was good, the soundtrack was aight, but the show? No. I can't say I liked it much at all.
I would reccomend this show to some people I guess? It might be for some people but I just can't see why people like the 2nd half and the ending of this show, and if anyone wants to point anything out to me that I may have missed, go right ahead.",2

                This anime was recommended to me a while ago, but i never sat down to watch it like i had promised I would. Worst mistake of my life. I just completed this series for the first time a few days ago, and all i can say is that it immediately skyrocketed to my top 3. Easily. I'm still debating whether or not it's my number 1 right now. I will admit that I loved this anime so much that I went and bought the limited edition ($100) just so i could have it in my collection. I helped that I was half-asleep when i ordered
                  it so i wasn't thinking.
Story: 10/10 revolutionary. I've seen quite a few anime and let me tell you it is very difficult for me to get emotionally involved with a story. I can count on one hand how many there are. There are good anime and then there are the legendary anime that I can't put down. This happens to be one. It always keeps you guessing, never wanting to stop, and takes your emotions and brings them to the next level.
Art: 10/10 Sexy. There's nothing too groundbreaking here, but it is very vibrant, full of life, and easy on the eyes. The animation is top notch and there are a few scenes where it picks up and flows very nicely.
Sound: 9/10 Beautiful. Not much to say other than it has a great score with music that will deepen your attachment to the story. I've watched a few episodes in Japanese, then tried the English dub, and must say I prefer the English on this one. The voice actors in here are top notch and know what they are doing, giving unbelievable realism to the characters.
Chartacters: 10/10 Lovable. I honestly thought I was going to get annoyed by Taiga, but there is something about her that puts her among my most revered characters. Ryuji as well was a pleasant surprise in how his character progressed through the show. I loved his personality and could identify with him quite well. All the supporting characters were fantastic. Minori and Kitamura put a lot into the show and really helped it's progression
Enjoyment: 10/10 Will watch again. 
Overall: 10/10 Masterpiece. The day after I finished this anime, I felt a sincere longing to re-watch it. It kept bugging me and bugging me until i finally yelled at my brain to quit pestering me and that I promised i would watch it again soon. My point is, this is a romcom that gives you a well-known topic and throws a bunch of curve-balls at you leaving you with a much needed, refreshing take on the genre. It kept me on my toes the whole time and rooting for the characters. You will not be disappointed at all.",10

                        Toradora is a show that gets too much credit for being one of the only true romance anime series that comes even close to being good.
        Anime has a serious habit of avoiding straight forward romance like the plague, and when they do decide to make an effort to create something that is completely centered around two characters and their romantic relationship together something always goes wrong. I like to think it's some mysterious phenomenon that occurs when a studio tries to bravely veer away from the harem genre.      If you, a savvy anime fan, have been in the community for any extended period of time or have an affinity for romance, then you have probably heard people praising Toradora as one of their favorite shows or the best romance anime. And while the show isn't the garbage some claim, I do believe that people's opinions are biased towards it given the existence of a straight forward romance anime is extremely rare. 
        For the most part, as expected, there really isn't a true plot to the show. (only small couple episode arcs to develop characters) The plot given isn't really a plot so much as a display of the character's ever changing relationship. This is where the majority of Toradora's strengths and weaknesses derive. Each and every character is created with a visible love put into them. You can tell that the team behind his spent the majority of its time in this department, making sure that each character gets their fair share of backstory and development so each character feels like a real person... for the most part. The only character that stays stagnant is the male lead. He never really changes and unfortunately comes out by the end of the show looking like any other harem/romance ""milk-toast, Yuji-every lead"" (digibro, the Asterisk War Sucks part 1). Regardless of most of the characters feeling like they could exist in a 3d world, there are still plenty of moments in Toradora where their reactions to situations and interactions with each other can feel unnatural and as if they only take place to create conflict. (which they do)
         Some of the moments can make you cringe at how sappy they can get and only become more intrusive as the show carries on. It sometimes feels like it just has absolutely no subtlety. (The ending to the show comes off as particularly awkward and rushed.)
         Toradora sports the same rainbow colored characters designs and general visual aesthetic that we have come to expect from any lightnovel adaptation, and the soundtrack is pretty average too aside from the first opening.
         Overall, I don't think that you should get your hopes up too high for this one. As a romance story in general it isn't really anything special, but I can still recommend this to anyone who has been searching for a straight forward romance in their medium of choice. 
Anecdote: Please do not message me with blind hate, though I am interested in and open minded to, any sound arguments that you may have.

                This Anime just happened to cross my path after exploring the romance comedy genre that had the boy meets girl formula. While expecting nothing big I was proven wrong as I was enjoying myself through the whole thing.
Story: As i stated above, this is a girl meets boy formula. As flavorless as these types of plots tend to be, it takes it in a direction where both Takasu Ryuuji (Main Boy) and Aisaka Taiga (Main Girl) try to aid each other with their difficulties in romance. As they spend more time together things get complicated and saying anything more would be a spoiler.
Score - 8,
                  Whist not being a masterpiece that sets it on the pinnacle of romancedom worth investing your time, brings something to the table. It's a 'very good' love story.
Note: Emotional impact is rated by 'Enjoyment'.
Art: Animation was very well done, not once in the anime did I have any problems with any of the illustrations or the animation.
Score - 8, its all good.
Sound - Voice acting was exceptionally well done for Taiga, OP and EDs were pleasant to hear. No problems to report.
Score - 8, not like anyone watches anime purely for the sound anyway...
Character - I'm pretty mixed here, there were some characters that got on my nerves from time to time. I really didn't understand Ryuuji's interest in Kushieda Minori, or Taiga's interest for Kitamura Yuusaku. It was almost irritating watching Taiga get with Yuusaku. He serves as a good side character, but really a hindrance to the plot if you ask me. His character could've been done better in a lot of ways, for example if he was superior than Ryuuji and made it feels like Ryuuji has less chances with Taiga with him around but Yuusaku never gives the intimidating feeling of losing your woman to him. He's Ryuuji's only male rival in the entire series make him at least cool or sexy.
Minori, being the airhead character of the series didn't really work for me. Having her as a side would be fitting and I really didn't mind her as a main, but her personality made it awkward at times where she wanted to be serious.
Kawashima Ami was probably the anime's strongest character besides Taiga, I really enjoyed her presence in the anime and the way she complicates the love plot.
Taiga is our little tsundere package, the palm top tiger. From a rich family, lives alone and is completely hopeless with house chores and cooking. Considered a delinquent at school. That's where Ryuuji comes in. Her nickname itself  is explanatory and the word ""tsundere"" makes it really easy to get a basic picture of what you might see. Trust me, it's better.
Most importantly our main character Ryuuji. He is definitely one of the more interesting male protagonists of the animes out there. He's very knowledge in just about anything housework, is actually useful, assertive with his actions in the plot, and his emotional scenes work. Qualities most male protagonist in these types of anime seem to miss, all of them centering around the females while the male main tends to be the doll who's there to get pounded on every time providence tosses him into a perverted scenario.
Score - 9, I don't hate Minori and Yuusaku. They don't get enough development to have enough momentum for the roles they were in. I like them all, love Ami though.
Enjoyment - Just because it's a comedy doesn't mean it can't be deep and dramatic. Remember that this is also a romance, and unless it's a fairytale story, you can expect to go through some hard times. There are very emotional scenes in this anime, not just sad emotional moments, but extremely happy moments that make you tear up and go ""aw..."". I managed to wet my dry tear ducts with the Christmas episode.
Score - 9, It's worth watching through to the very end to experience the emotional scenes. I'm sure everyone can find it in their hearts to smile watching them.
Overall - I really had lots of fun watching this anime. the urge to rewatch it as i write this review is proof that this anime was worth a damn to visit and revisit.
Score - 9
Watch it! You might even find your potential waifu!",9
"
                Tora-Dora is one of those rare animes that takes a twist in its romance. It's a different sort of love-tale, one not told at the back of gyms like most animes. But rather, it is geniune story of two people who slowly come to realise feelings for each other. This is what drew me in instantly - the originality
The characters bump off rather naturally on each other -  perfectly played to be very entertaining and likeable people. Though they are at first rather shallow; as expected in most highschool romance animes, the anime quickly plunge us into deeper water. Fantastically so, the creators detail
                  the characters' personalities to the extent when you're not quite sure the person you watched on the first episode is quite as lovely as she seems. What becomes highschool romance becomes far more indepth, complicating the feelings and situations between characters - something not usually dealt with at all in anime.
Though the action scenes are few and far between, it is easy to tell there is animated beautifully. The sound was the usual banter around anime to be honest, but still enjoyable.
Overall, a 9 for anyone considering watching this. It's an excellent anime for people looking for something a bit smart, but entertaining. Don't be lured in by its genre however; if you're looking for something you can watch while comatose over some tea - you may find yourself missing some small but crucial details.",9
"
                First, sorry for my bad english
This anime is my first romantic anime, the characters are pretty good and have great start, but the major error of the anime is the number of episodes, is repetitive, there is like 8 episodes of plot development, all the other are the same boring ""Boy likes girl but is too shy to say anything, girl likes boy but is too shy to say""
And have some cliches like beach episodes where no developent occurs(i really don't understand why a lot of animes have it), travel episodes(more intesting then the beach) and girls fight(no usefull)
So, if you have some animes on
                  your whatch list, don't see this anime. If you still wanna see, pick the episodes 1,2,3,4,22,23,24,25",4
"
                This will be a spoiler warning, so if you haven't seen the series yet, I'd recommend go watch it only if you are a huge fan of the romantic comedy genre.
I'm fairly new to anime, and one thing that i'm constantly noting is how writters and producers have so many good, ingenious ideas, just to execute them terribly bad *cough* SAO *cough*. Aaaand Toradora is not exception to this. The anime comunity praises this show as one of the greatest romances ever, and it could have been, if it wasn't because the creators of this series forgot one tiny tiny detail : SUBTLETY.
STORY 6/10
Ok ,
                  this was for me the biggest dissapointment of the series, by far. They have all this great ideas for the different arcs, and then they are doing a great job in executing it, aaaand just when you are on the climax, waiting to see the grand finale, it turns into this over the top over dramatic ridiculous story that leaves you with a giant WTF!!! moment. Don't know what I mean:
For example, you have this arc about Kitamura, that deals with the conflict of having the person you love go far away from you, and the burden of taking a position that involves a lot of responsability, especially since the loved one was the person in charge of said position. Great topic for a story, and you have genuinely emotional moments, like when Taiga wants to watch Kitamura's sleeping face ( after he escaped home) and she sees he cried to sleep. 
But then by the end of the arc, you have the confession where Kitamura starts to scream at the top of his lungs in front of all the school that he loves the council president (whose name I don't remmeber) , and as if this wasn't ridiculous enough, Taiga gets in a overly ridiculous and over the top sword fight with the president, because Taiga was furious that she hurt Kitamura only because president wasn't able to accept the feelings she had for Kitamura, and even though the explanation as to why she couldn't do it made sense, after all those ridiculous events I couldn't give less of a shit.
Another example, Taiga showing her affection for Ryuji while they were friends. Good example: When Ryuji is trying to convince Taiga to give her father an opportunity to fix their relation, and when he starts to explain how lucky she is that her father is still alive, and is on the brink of tears, Taiga only caress his face and says: ''Ok , i'll go but don't put that face'' 
Bad Example: During the swimming competition, when Ryuji is drowning, and Taiga, who two seconds ago couldn't swim, suddenly becomes a profesional diver, and to make matters worse, when people try to approach Ryuji to help him , she starts to yell histerically ''DONT TOUCH MY RYUJI!!! even though she wasn't even in love with him yet.
Why does the first example works? Because of how realistic and relatable it is. The second one isn't only over the top, but ridiculous and stupid.
This example sumarizes all the problems I had with the story of Toradora, there are tons of other examples but it's gonna take me an eternity to describe them, so i'll just leave it at that.
Art: 7/10
It does it's job for the most part, but there are a lot of scenes that felt to stale because of characters just talking and the only movement yo could see was that of their mouths. Character desings , were kind of cliche, and the one for Taiga feels like a direct rip off of Louise from Familiar of Zero. 
Sound: 5/10
The only reason why I think sound deserves 5 is because of the song ''Lost my Pieces'' that is the main theme of the show, such a beatiful song. There was another one that I liked a lot but can't remember it's name. The rest are just there to accompany the animation. I didn't like at all the openings and endings, but a lot of people like the first opening, not sure why.
Character: 7/10
This is another really dissapointing area of this show. In one hand you have this characters that feel like cookie - cutter characters, but then you see there is a extra, a twist to all of them. Taiga is your typical tsundere but also can be very childish, shy and a klutz. Minorin is your typical hyper, happy go lucky character, but also can become extremely angry (and frightening) or just aggresive. The rest of characters have similar characterizations, which is good, because they felt kind of realistic. The problem is that , except for the blue haired bitch and Taiga, characters don't develope that much. I wish I could have seen more of Minorin, she was by far my favourite character (strange thing since I usually hate her kind of character) and it was doing a great job during episode 3 that was more focused on her (my personal favourite episode) , but after that she is mostly forgotten until way latter into the show.
What does develope however are the relations between characters, and this probably was the strongest point of the show. Take for instance Taiga and Ryuji, for the most part they stayed as friends, but not the kind of ''I wanna be with you but misunderstandings dont allow it'' friends. Both were in love with different people, and that was great to see how they supported each other as friends. Another relation I loved was the one of Ryuji and the blue haired bitch.
Enjoyment 7/10
I had a decent time watching this show, I mean I pretty much marathoned it, but except for some occasions , I never felt like it touched me emotionally, and hell, I cry with ease when it comes to storytelling.
Overall 6/10
It's a shame how the final product resulted, especially because you see the creator had a lot of good ideas, and even some excellent executions, but then wanted to force you to feel, force you to get emotional, and then is when it failed miserably. But as said , if you are a fan of romantic comedies, then you will enjoy this one for sure.",6
"
                If there is one anime that exemplifies how a high school rom-com should be done, its Toradora! This is one of the best romance anime I've seen and one of the best high school setting shows as well.
Story:
Toradora's story is not necessarily a weak point, but there are some little things that stop the story from being amazing. The story section does not cover the romance portion, that's better summed up in the characters section. Toradora! is basically a story of a guy and a girl helping each other try to date the others best friend. There are little arcs that usually end in some
                  character development for each of the main characters. The protagonist seems to amass a bit of a harem, and there's no problem with that, except for one thing. My biggest problem with the story is that from the first episode, before all of the possible romantic interests are introduced it is obvious who Ryuuji will end up with. That took the story down a notch or two since it just seemed like all of the romantic moments with separate girls and their development meant nothing overall.
7/10
Art:
The art is colorful and pretty simple throughout the show. There are many genuinely beautiful scenes, especially during the last few episodes that take place in the winter. Other than that the character designs are pretty standard, except Ryuuji who has delinquent eyes. His design is the best in my opinion and that bumps the art up a bit, since a well designed protagonist is always a high priority.
7/10
Sound:
The sound in Toradora is really well done, the music is fitting and near the end the atmosphere the sound creates can be very emotional. The voice actors are great. I watched the dub, since I heard it was good. Every voice was well done, and Taiga's voice was especially fitting.
8/10
Characters:
Oh boy, here we go. Toradora has some of the best characters in an anime I've seen so far. Every character is unique and funny with a distinct personality. None of them are massively cliche and they all develop well. By the end you really feel for each character of the show and that leads to a lot of emotion. The romance is great as well, the last few episodes could possibly make you cry from how perfectly represented the romance is, but you'll also feel awful for the girls who love Ryuuji, without reciprocated feelings.
9/10
Enjoyment:
I loved every episode, nothing was out of place and the show progressed nicely as a whole. The whole show is a blast from start to finish.
9/10
Overall:
I wholeheartedly recommend the show to anyone. Make it top priority.

"
                Toradora is probably the best romance anime out there focussing on 2 parts of romance: Friendship and love. Toradora will make you cherish every happy moment and will make u feel sorry for them when something bad happends. Since the anime is realistic, feelings are more easily expressed and u get a deeper feeling with characters.
Since this anime is slife of life. Story doesn't matter to much but the story in Toradora is enough to describe the character design more easily.  
When we watch a romance we want the Character design to be good. And Toradora made an outrageous Character design with unique aspects
                  and alot of realism. With great events taking place in the anime this anime has the right to be called: One of the best Romance anime's. 
Ofcourse your personal feeling about the anime could be different. 
Story:
A basic story about the characters of Toradora it's not like it matters but it's quite good since the surroundings are taking part of that story. Tough anyhting that happends returns once or twice but after like 5 episodes it fades away and you'll never see it again. note That is the only bad thing about Toradora.
Art:
The art is oldschool style what anime's tended to use in that time. In compersing with that art style they did great and everything looks good and realistic. 
Sound:
The sound is good, use of great effects and sounds in general made it good and better then most anime's. ofcours it isn't perfect but it's pretty good.
The theme's of the anime (background music) is good and fits quite with the anime.
Charcter:
The best character design i've seen. All unique characters which aren't overdone. The character's go from a student to a top model. And i do not see any characters look like each other. The reactions of characters are done greatly. With the use of Yandere (small form) and realistic reactions of people making it feel really comfortable. The real feelings will be hidden from the main character as well as the watcher. Because of this you will get curious and want to see more and more. 
Enjoyment:
Top enjoyment, i kept watching. Cried of happyness and sadness. Basicly anything you want from this type of anime.
Overall:
Top Romance anime, insane character design with realism at it's best.
Recommended for everyone.",10

                This review contains spoilers on the last episode!
Toradora!
 So.... this was amazing. Finished up 13-25 in terms of episodes so I can write the review now.
 To put it bluntly, I still have tears on my face. Taiga... and Ryuuji... just incredible.
 The story about high school kids in love with one another. It's more than just a love triangle and the feelings given and received throughout is nothing short of incredible.
 Putting the story aside for a bit, I can begin with everything else. The OP and ED's used are amazing and really capture Toradora!. The art style is neat and the proportions for
                  many scenes are extended outward and give this huge length appeal to it. Simple gestures such as hands reaching outwards feels different in Toradora! than in other anime. The way the characters were drawn is great and the eyes, man the eyes in Toradora! is so wildly different! The colors aren't pastel and brightly colored, but more subdued and ""real"". On-top of that, I love how Ryuuji was made to look like, it really was great seeing such a different look for a gentle and kind MC.
 The characters are all brilliant, even if Ami was a bit too cryptic with what she tried to say. Taiga is, quite honestly, fantastic; selfish, but rather amazing none-the-less. Kushieda Minori, I'm glad I was able to experience her hidden emotions better; like Ami, she too, was very cryptic using other subjects to inject her feelings in. Ryuuji, for having to go through what he did, I feel like he handled the situations in a good manner, even if they did get incredibly complex and loopy. I can't forget Aisaka either, a mother to Ryuuji, but her development during the last episodes was really needed, although the situation placed upon her was hard to handle, she's pretty great.
 I wish Ami would have been more upfront with her feelings, I feel so sad for her, she really was the odd one out.
 I didn't know what I was going to watch when I was recommended this anime, I expected it to be something truly depressing and sad, but it's not that at all. For the most part, it's up-beat, happy and wildly funny. Though there were many scenes, especially towards the end, when my eyes would fill with water or I would have tears fall down my face.
 The last episode..... So being naïve and gullible, I honestly expected Taiga to stay with Ryuuji and get married. I believe they make an amazing couple. The scenes before things went down made it really seem like she wanted to stay and be with Ryuuji. When we see Ryuuji read the note, I was so sad, it hurt to watch and the damn waterworks, my goodness. It's sad to think about it as I write this down! . I believe, that even though the ending is left in a slightly open fashion, Taiga and Ryuuji do get together. I can't help but feel like that's what the characters themselves would do. Taiga, as brave and ridiculous as she can be, I don't believe she is a shining star all alone, heck no, she's not alone and Ryuuji will always be there for her. The way they do the fake marriage and the kissing that transpires, so incredible. 
 In the end, Toradora! is fantastic, I truly think this. I think the cast of characters we follow are incredible and the story between them is well done. The art style used is easy to watch, even with scenes that include weird proportions. The music is on point and the comedy is really funny, when there is comedy to be had. I won't forget about this one at all, because Taiga and Ryuuji, they really are fantastic.... just so damn fantastic.",10

                This'll be my First review of an anime, so mind me.
I. Love. Toradora! It's one of the best Rom-Com anime ever created, and my favorite anime of all time. 
Story: 9.5/10
The Synopsis explains it all. The Story itself is great, especially how the character getting along with each other. But, I feel the ending is kinda rushed.
Art: 10/10 
Beautiful. That's all I have to say.Character: 9/10
Character development is one major thing on anime, and this one got a good hang of it. Even though some character got a late introduction, but hey, who cares?
Overall: 10/10
Overall, it's a good anime. You should watch it if you are into Romance-type of anime. I would definitely recommend it. But if you're not interested in Romance, give it a go, you probably like the comedy too.",10
"
                Having seen many romance and slice of life anime, I have to say that Toradora is one of the best out there. It is predictable at times, but it's different from many of the traditional romance anime out there. Of course, we all know how the anime is going to end, but the journey to the ending is unique.
The story follows these two main characters as they try to find love. The girl is a tsundere, who has trouble expressing her emotions and often uses violence because of it, while the guy is a very nice and servant-like person, who everyone mistakes as a delinquent
                  because of his looks.
With the first few episode, the anime focuses on the two characters' interactions with one another. We see how they meet, how they became somewhat like friends before it starts to focus on other characters and developing the plot. I found Taiga to be annoying the first few episodes due to the fact that she was whining half the time, but as the show continued, she became a more likeable character and she ended up as my favourite. 
Plot 9/10 - It was a simple enough plot, but it was also interesting. In each episode, there was something going on and it progressed in a good pace. It wasn't too fast and it wasn't too slow. 
Characters 8/10 - The development of the characters was well done as we see them transform as the show continued. We saw the development of Taiga and Takasu, mainly, but also the side characters as well. The show did a really good job on focusing on everybody, but not drawing away from the main plot line. 
Art 10/10 - The animation did a good job of highlighting the character's personalities. It showed the different sides of Taiga, the kindness of Takasu, and a lot more that made this anime enjoyable.
Overall 5/5 - After watching Toradora, I have to say this might be my favourite slice of life anime as of yet. There were some flaws, but the pros outweighed the cons at the end and it was very fun to watch. I'd recommend this show to anyone who likes comedy and slice of life genres. ",10

                Toradora! is a very popular series, especially within the romantic comedy genre. It’s one of the few shows in the genre that I’ve seen that doesn’t have some sort of supernatural twist, and I think that helps set it apart from all of the other shows. Toradora! is every bit as good as you’ve heard, and maybe even a little bit better.
Story:
There are five main characters in Toradora!, but the story mainly revolves around two characters. There is Ryuuji, a thuggish looking neat freak, and Taiga, a short statured girl with anger issues. They both attend the same high school with their best friends. Ryuuji
                  is in love with Taiga’s best friend Minori, and Taiga is in love with Ryuuji’s best friend Yuusaku. After discovering each other’s feelings, they decide to work together in order win the hearts of those they love. The story shows us the everyday lives of the characters in their pursuit of that love.
Animation:
The animation is really well done. Its solid animation, with well crafted characters and scenery. Even though it’s nothing spectacular, the style fits the story and the characters.",9

                I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that this show is intense. I'm not gonna say it's hilarious. And to say it's action-packed would be an utter lie. What I will tell you about Toradora! is that it has so much heart, it overflows with it. Up to this moment, as I sit here right after the final credits roll, I thought Kirito and Asuna had the strongest love of any show (say what you will about SAO, but the love in that show was true and very well done). However, now I know what love in TV shows and anime should be, and
                  this is it.
Following the high school lives of two students, both of whom are somewhat feared by their classmates as agressive or intimidating, Toradora! is a fanatstic love story. The two students meet, spend lots of time together and fall in love...wait, they don't? Instead, the two are actually interested in each other's best friends. This is where the plot takes off.
With a plot as simple as this, you wonder how this show could be longer than 12 episodes and how it could be any good. But, as they say, love is not easy. The true appeal to Toradora! isn't following the love of the two main characters over each other's best friends, but it's the relationship that forms between the two mains themselves. You know after a few episodes that they will never end up with who they say they want to end up with, or at the very least, the chances are quite slim. The real love story actually occurs between the two main characters, Taiga and Ryuuji. That's why this show excels. It gives enough time for these two characters to actually build a relationship and fall in love for a good reason, and that's what a true love story needs, not just picking someone out of a crowd 'because reasons'. It's a truly captivating story and it melts the heart as the two struggle to get better acquainted with other people, when really fate was in front of them the whole time...dear god, that was sappy and cliche.
Characters. Oh boy the characters. They are what truly make this show so great. I don't just mean Taiga and Ryuuji and the relationship they build, but the other people involved in this crazy love triangle as well as the people who make up the sidelines really propel this show forward. Side characters are very comedic when they need to be and very relevant and serious when they have to be. They aren't just thrown in for plot advancement and then tossed aside. They are always there and they are always important. As for the main characters who aren't Taiga and Ryuuji, they each play their roles very well, ranging from crazy, yet caring student body leader to bitchy, yet caring ex-model (everyone cares a lot in this show).
The animation is where I feel this show lacks. In shows like Attack on Titan you have a very signatire style of animation and in shows like No game No Life, bright colors and visual cues really stand out. However, Toradora! doesn't have this. Honestly, the animation is very generic. It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it definitely is not a selling point for the show.
Sound, on the other hand, is handled very well. The show itself ranges from upbeat and happy to mellow and soothing to sad and gloomy. The music fits it perfectly in each of these scenarios. The openings were also both very good, and while they aren't quite my style, a shoutout has to be made for the 1st opening ""Pre-Parade"" for being so damn catchy.
All in all, should you watch Toradora!? Well, I mean, as always it depends on your taste. But if you want an entertaining love story that pulls your heartstrings as it drags you along  for an insane, fun ride, there's no better option.
Positives:
+""Pre-Parade"" and ""Silky Heart"" are both decent openings, the prior being ridiculously catchy
+Greatest. Love. Story. EVER
+Very well done characters, each having a very unique and interesting personality
+Soundtrack was entertaining while also fitting the show in gloomier scenarios
+Very emotional, yet also quite comedic and fun
Negatives:
-Animation lacked in overall appeal
-This is small, but I noticed that the dub was a bit off in certain places, though not nearly enough to ruin the dub as a whole
-Every character in this show is RIDICULOUSLY naive. But what can you expect from a love story?
Toradora! is indeed a great show, and I think that to many it could definitely be a masterpiece. No love is stronger (at least from shows I've seen), and the story as a whole kept me thoroughly intrigued and impressed throughout.
And that is why Toradora! gets a 9/10.
Hope this review was helpful!",9

                Disclaimer: This is a full on spoilers review. If you wish a short summary of my review (spoiler-free) and if this show is for you, then just scroll down to the ""Recommendation"" section.
---
We all want and seek love for various reasons, whether it be to avoid the grim darkness of loneliness, adding a new spice into your life, or just something that you wish for - even if have no clue as to why. In the beginning, Toradora starts with a statement that love is a gentle and sweet thing. If you could put your eyes on it, it would be something that you would
                  desire greatly. Therefore, the Earth has hidden it, to make sure that not just anyone can obtain it. Whether or not you will be able to take hold of it is up to you in the end. Is this possibly foreshadowing the events that will later unfold in the show? Possibly, but whatever happens, Toradora - just like most Romantic-Comedies (RomCom for short) - has a slightly hard time striking a balance between romance and comedy, with each half of the plot differing in tones. With the initial half being the weaker of the two, this leads to missed opportunities to establish a foundation for the events later on in the show. Overall, while this show had a lot of the things I like about RomComs, it still has some flaws that cannot be ignored.
One of the things people in love have in common is knowing how hard it is to approach the person they are interested in without fumbling their words all over the place, so they end up relying on someone else to help them with this feat. This is how Toradora begins. The fated encounter between Taiga ‘Palmtop Tiger’ Aisaka and Ryuuji ‘The Delinquent’ Takasu starts with them helping each other out in their quests to conquer their respective love interests, Yuusaku Kitamura and Minori Kushieda. Unfortunately, after forming the pact, their goals are pushed further away after Yuusaku and Minori misinterpret their relationship due to how much time they spend with each other. This starts a common theme throughout Toradora, showing that life does not always go the way you want it to. Nothing is ever promised nor owed to you; not unless you do your best to attain it. Then perhaps -- you might be able to take grasp of it.
One of the problems Toradora has is how it inserts emotions into the watcher, giving us a slight clue on how the characters feel, throughout the show’s narrative. Hints that slightly sway you to think that this character has an interest in him or her. For example, when Minori and Ryuuji get trapped in the storage house we see her hand tremble. This could be an indication that she is nervous due to her being alone and stuck with Ryuuji in the storage room, perhaps liking him more than a friend. The problem is not the insertion, it is what happens afterwards as well as the frequency of it. It gets swept away most of the times and gets muddled in the comedy that occurs following it. It is as if it was forgotten. Events popping up like Taiga's sudden cry and worry of Ryuuji, after he almost drowned due to an accident, being one of the first “drama” tied with the misleading notion that she suddenly cares for her dog, Ryuuji, feels off and unfitting. You could perhaps say that the scene was to show how Taiga reacts to an emergency involving Ryuuji and thus unaware of her emotions reacting in this way. This would be a fine interpretation but once again, this does not really leave much of an impact - if any - and is as I said earlier, this becomes diluted and could be easily forgotten. This whole sum of foundation building leads to the later half where the show starts to show its more serious tone, gripping the actual romance part of RomCom, which is not as well supported as it could have been thus leading to a less enjoyable experience. You could say that the comedy is a bit too much at first.
Once we reach the beach arc we start to notice improvements in humor as well as characterization. The show is lead by the actions of the characters and therefor it has to emphasize the development of them. During the beach arc we get to see an actual beach episode where fanservice is not the all-in-all. This is where the show strikes the balance between humor and build-up for the upcoming drama. With all the characters trying to do their best chiming in on the fun (service), Ryuuji and Taiga trying to scare Minori which does not really go exactly as planned, Ryuuji getting played on by Ami pretending she is showering but she was actually just cleaning the bath, and the never-ending universal argument of how spicy the curry should be. We get to see a lot more interactions which lead on to learning more about the girls, most of all Minori. With Ryuuji and her having a tender scene where they discuss a bit of ghost and love, drawing parallel to both that some people do not believe in ghost and some do, but some people deny their existence even though they have seen one as well as some other people who put in an effort finding it to see one. This scene is filled with imagery which acts as metaphors to how each character feels, Ami even though acting strong she does not seem that fulfilled, Taiga not feeling complete even though she is spending some time alone with Yuusaku, Ryuuji getting slightly down due to how Minori doesn't believe she will ever experience love. There are even more scenes like these, short ones but fully packed with everything that makes love triangles - or in this case, a love square - worthwhile watching. One more noteworthy part of the beach arc is the cave where the group, with exception of Minori, tries to scare her by making scare traps along the way while they explore the deep cave. The enjoyment when their attempts fail, as well as the continuing trend of keeping two characters all alone together (Ryuuji and Ami), later on solidifying how Ami feels about her situation as well as Minori.
Everyone gets improvement in every way in the central point of the plot, which very well prepares and leads smoothly on to the emotionally heavy core, the climax of the whole plot. Yuusaku gets his own very own arc where we see him lose character and completely change his attitude. This gives him the spotlight he so lacked before his arc. We now get to see all the characters put in effort to help him out to the right path once again. An important part of this arc is how Taiga starts to change how she feels about him after being informed that Yuusaku has feelings for the school council president, Sumire. But weirdly enough it revealed more about the other characters than him. Sure he is in love with Sumire and he gets on the wrong track due to her moving far away abroad. But it doesn't evolve his character later on, just like what happened in Ami's arc. Sadly, not everyone's arc was well done. Even though it happened earlier, Ami's arc which introduced her to the gang had a lesser impact on the whole. She starts off giving the aura of being an innocent, pretty girl who models for various fashion magazines. The issue which had to be resolve in her arc was this stalker that kept following her around non-stop, disallowing Ami a peace of mind which leads her to go on hiatus from her modelling as well as being constantly paranoid. This is a rather ridiculous way of getting her into the group. She does not join the group because she likes Taiga's tsun-tsun behavior against her nor is she getting along with Minori like Taiga is. How it goes is that she ends up - somehow - falling in-love with Ryuuji, only for changing her mind on having the facade she used to have and to start being more ""honest"" with herself. The way this is done is making us believe that she will accept her ""ill-natured behavior and look"", but later on we see her continue with the facade, even though it is to a lesser degree than before. She also somehow falls in-love with Ryuuji during the process, which is not really explained, metaphorically nor literally. The sense of not knowing why she feels that way is gives the impression of her arc feeling flat.
But with weaknesses comes strength as well, one cannot exist without the other - with the exception of Pupa perhaps - and the later parts of the show is the one that completely toys with everyone's emotions. It finally digs into the conflict, where all the girls start to understand more about each other's feelings towards Ryuuji. We get to see Minori watch in the background while Taiga weeps after realizing her mistake of letting him go after Minori to confess. In the process Minori finally shows the side we were all waiting for, the one where she is not holding up this upbeat facade, and now she has to choose a path whether or not to allow Taiga to be with him or be selfish and fulfill her own happiness. But this is just the beginning of the steep hill towards the climax. Just the beginning. Scenes showing Taiga's care of Ryuuji are now more apparent than ever, an example where she fights for the hairpin which is a precious gift and item symbolizing his love in the form of an object. But staying in the same setting where the status quo is upheld, there has to be a change of setting to force the characters - stubborn one that is, such as taiga - to break out of their shell, with them worried about hurting one another.
In the peak of it all, the group are now in the mountain tops, enjoying their school trip skiing which sets a perfect environment for the characters to - literally - be forced to be close to each other and leave no room for escape. Which brings us to the scene where Ami pokes Minorin non-stop questioning her feelings. Ami has always been the one that keeps on trying to make Taiga and Minori's shell to burst, because she is tired of watching ever so vigilantly on the ""kids"" playing around and never getting the the ""true"" core. Always avoiding the subject of love, which frustrates Ami since she understands how she is not able to win over Taiga -- which is continuously shown throughout the show whenever she pokes and flirts with Ryuuji when they are around the others, or whenever a topic that could lead to their realization of their emotions. Ami is not able to follow her heart, being with Ryuuji, which in her mind understands it cannot happen due to how she understand how he feels about Taiga. Instead of trying to hurt herself in an unwinnable war, she tries to brutally poke at Minori and continues to bash on how Minori fools around, which leads us to their fight of the previously mentioned fight in the room. With Taiga attempting to stop the fight, but accidentally falls off the cliff setting off a traumatizing event for everyone involved since they cannot find Taiga and a blizzard storm is now raging outside. Toradora in its final moments at last uses to great effect its side characters as a clam to get Tiger and Dragon together. The ending felt rushed, but it fit how after the event of Taiga's disappearance, made an adrenaline pumping moment both for all the characters as well as for the viewer, thus making the what seems to be a rushed ending, a fitting one. The distraught coming from how Ami dealt with her fate with Ryuuji adult-like, and how Minori fell together at the end making a pool of tears, a bit like a child who weeps, set off a conclusive ending to both of their arcs -- now that fate has chosen Taiga and Ryuuji to be together.
At the beginning we asked if there is such thing as a fateful encounter, and whether it is possible to always stay with our loved ones. Is fate a real thing? Do our actions affect it? Toradora explores these themes by showing us both sides to the story. Midori accepting that Taiga is better suited for Ryuuji, and while accepting that fate she also chooses her own path to make their happiness her own. For Ami, she is a little similar. Early on she understood that this is an unwinnable war, so she does her best to help them both in her own way, even though it may seem harsh. For some, fate does not favour them. After all, fate works in strange ways. One day, perhaps you might meet the love of your life, someone that you compare to. Like two beasts that stand equal to one another, just like Tiger and Dragon.
---
Recommendation: Toradora is a Romantic-Comedy which sets out to allow the side characters attempt to force the highlighted pair to get together. This show is nicely done overall but with some few basic flaws such as how scenes are lead after another in a way that doesn't amplify the desired emotion, lagging animation during most scenes, not all characters feel complete, as well as a weak first half that plays around with little consequences. But the later half is what makes the show worthwhile watching - if you manage to get through the first half - and the conflict arises using the side-characters which leads to the climax which goes by like an adrenaline rush. If you like these kinds of shows and don't mind all too much about its cinematography, then this should be a watch worth while. It doesn't hurt to note that fans of tsunderes will enjoy this a lot.",7
"
                Anime... we need to talk.  Honestly though it's me, not you, I've changed and I realize that now.  The unfortunate collateral though is Toradora, which by all rights is fine.  Toradora you're not the problem either, you're not even bad, it's just me.  A decade and a half plus of anime watching and being an adult will do that to you.  So Toradora, don't feel bad about my score, you're still OK, but it's just not want I want now and perhaps for others like me which is why I've decided to write this.
In a different time and place, perhaps
                  10 years ago or maybe back in college this might of been a show I feel in love with and it could be for you.  I feel that I need to say that this show probably will be (and heck, clearly is) loved by many.  For me though, I just can't do it anymore.
Toradora has some truly awesome moments, probably about 3 or 4 really stand out scenes that make you think ""OK, this is why we're here, this is what we've signed up for"", but than just kinda continues and as lame of a description as I know this is, that's Toradora.  It just continues.  It plods along, gives you a great moment than just continues for many episodes, shows you something special and than... continues for episode after episode and... well you get it.  Toradora isn't slow, there aren't pacing problems, it just moves smoothly along at 5 below the speed limit as to not get a ticket.  When all you really want is for it to just pick it up to 10 over because no one will ticket you for that and we can get to the destination sooner.
Again going back to this being my problem I hopped on this show way after the fact.  So basically I've been inundated with threads, scores and youtube videos saying how great the romance is.  This is where my years of anime and age will hurt you Toradora because well... that isn't really what I think of when I think romance.  Man if lets say episode 26 was actually episode 20, that would be been amazing.  That's what I wanted.  I wasn't really looking for the weirdly rushed and out of place moments in the conclusion.
I want to see love, I want to see couples, I don't want to see dozens of episodes of the main characters ""friends"" saying they want to help and be their for the couple, but well, they aren't really or people leading others on with no intention of doing anything.  Or episode after episode of two characters clearly knowing what they want, but neither doing anything about it.  These aren't the helpful friends the show says they are or the great characters I hope to see.  
What's the main romance wasn't even bad, it wasn't cheap, it wasn't rushed or any of the multitude of ways you can describe romances you didn't like, it was, well, wishy washy.  I don't want to see that kind of stuff in real life let alone 26 episodes of wishy washy behavior.  You can't even give it the classic ""will they or won't they"" description since it's more ""they should be, just what is taking so long"".  Dragging it out and making things take too long doesn't make a payoff all the more grand, it almost makes the payoff just a sigh of relief, when you can say ""finally, it's about time"" and that's not a good thing.
And that brings me back to my main point.  Toradora, it's me, you're just not for me anymore.  You might of been, heck you most likely really were right in my wheel house, but now I just can't put up with it.  You can't give me 3 awesome moments, ignore them, give me 10 minutes of great in the last episode and than insult your own ending by being all anime.  Obviously I'm in a minority and this show is loved by many.  I mentioned early it's not bad, this is purely a personal preference which I can clearly see.  So this goes out to people like me, if you could imagine yourself saying these words than Toradora isn't for you because it will leave you disappointed and frustrated in the end.
Oh and lets see... show looks fine with satisfactory character designs, but I'm also done with little girl looking characters, but for some reason it didn't make me stop watching so good on you Toradora.  I honestly can't remember music so it couldn't of been that good.  Basically it was as by the book, fine as you can get from production values.  Though there are a few moments when characters scream at each other or fight where things get all serious like you're about to watch some absurd fight in an action/adventure that stood out in an odd way.
Before I close this way too long review I just want to mention the supporting characters one more time because for the most part they were ehh... they kinda grated on me, I mention about how everyone's outlook is just frustrating and it seems like they aren't really great friends.  Hearing someone say ""but I just wanted you to be happy"", but not actually helping the couple get together isn't helping that person be happy.  Anime needs to learn this, that one is on you anime, that's not my problem, that's one of the few problems that's yours.",5

                Story
The story revolves around Ryuuji and Taiga. Taiga wants to admit her love to Kitamura and accidentally puts a love letter in Ryuuji’s bag instead of Kitamura’s. Next thing he knows, Ryuuji is helping Taiga get together with the class president. And to put it simply, lots of complications get in the way, including the growing affections between Taiga and Ryuuji which leads to a fantastic, dramatic, and sad ending that is sure to stay with you for a long time.
The story isn’t amazingly amazing, but it’s good for a romance. It has a lot of good situations for the characters to grow and get
                  closer. It’s a school romance that has a lot of typical situations of the genre, but they are fresh due to the strong characters. The ending is one of the best parts of the story with a lot of drama, and a lot of things coming together. The very, very end is not particularly great and leaves a lot to be desired, but if you can get a hold of an English translation of the novels this show is based on, the ending is a lot better there and you won’t feel like you are missing something and be wondering about the romance going further.
Animation
The animation of Toradora! is good, but it’s not amazing. It’s not bad in any way, shape, or form. The characters look good, the action scenes are fluid, the action in general is fluid, and character emotions are well shown through the eyes and mouth and other subtle things.
Sound
Toradora has two different openings and closings. The first opening song was great, the second OK. The ending songs were both good. The voice actors were great, conveying emotion perfectly. The music in the background was good, and the sound effects were all good. Nothing much to complain about here.
Characters
Here is where Toradora! really shines. Ryuuji, Taiga, Ami, and all the other characters we spend a lot of time with are all fun characters, but as the series continues, we grow to really love them all. The main characters are so well fleshed out through the dialogue and the romances and they develop so well. In the twenty-five episodes, so much development is given to the characters that they feel real. The romance feels realistic, the story feels realistic, and the way the characters act feels realistic. All the main characters are great. As much I want to talk about all the characters, I don’t want to spoil the story for you. Just believe me when I say that all the main characters, especially Ryuuji and Taiga, develop amazingly well.
The side characters are good, but they don’t have enough screen time to really complain. The ones we get to meet are mostly Ryuuji’s friends and are all typical guys. Characters are very strong and as I’ve said, thanks to the character interactions and monologues, they become amazingly realistic.
Overall
Toradora! is an excellent romance. The characters act realistically, the writing is amazing, the animation is good, the voice actors bring great emotion. It’s long, very long, but the whole story fleshes out over the twenty-five episodes and we really get to learn to know and love these characters and cheer them on as they fall in love. It’s a very complicated story that I’m sure is generic for romance stories, though I wouldn’t know because I never had occasion to read or watch anything specifically romantic. Despite that, I found this story to be exciting, compelling, and I can’t stop saying how good this series is. No matter your age or gender, there is something to like here.
This is another series I am glad to have watched and another series I’m putting on my top ten anime I’ve ever seen.",9

                *Word of warning*
Very minor spoilers in the characters section, as this could not be reviewed without some explanation, although it is kept to a minimum.
I have always been a great fan of the Romantic Comedy genre. I have always been a fan of tsunderes.
A romantic comedy drama with a main female lead who is a deconstruction of the tsundere archetype voiced by Tsundere Queen Rie Kugimiya? I went into Toradora thinking it would be absolutely fantastic, and I still underestimated it...
Story - 10
With a lot of romantic comedies, there is the question of ""who is the main character going to end up with?"". This is
                  not the case with Toradora, as the first episode starts with an internal monologue of the two main characters, so you know how it's going to end. Even so, this question was still asked, as each female lead brought something new and interesting to the table.
The story bounces between serious and slapstick, and vice versa, at the drop of a hat. One second you could be in pain from laughing, and then next you could be wiping away tears.
Art - 9
Honestly, the only reason I rated art as 9 is because I felt uneasy about everything being a 10. Other than the anime being 7 years old, and the art being ever so slightly dated, it's perfect, and still better in some aspects than a lot of more recent anime.
Sound - 10
The music in Toradora is fantastic, and always knows how to amplify the mood of a particular scene. The kicker in the OST is a track called ""Lost My Pieces"", which can turn what is already a heartbreaking or heartwarming scene into an absolute tear-fest, and will ALWAYS play at the perfect moment. Because of this, Toradora takes its place as the first anime to bring tears to my eyes.
On the subject of dub vs sub, I watched it first subbed, and then re-watched it when the dub came out. In my opinion, both are spot-on perfect and there isn't a single character that I would re-cast in the dub, but I'd have to go with dub just for personal preference.
Characters - 10
In my opinion, character development is where Toradora shines. Each character is a deconstruction of their particular archetype;
The main male character who looks like your average delinquent, because he has his father's eyes, but is actually a friendly, and gentle clean-freak.
The main female character who acts like your average tsundere, but is actually insecure and has trust issues, which is why she doesn't want to become close to anyone.
The token genki girl who is always cheerful and holds down about 50 part-time jobs, the famous fashion model transfer student, the always cheerful and drunk carefree Mom, and even the class-rep, all have their own hidden flaws and motives. Even some of the background and supporting characters have in-depth development.
As you watch Toradora, you will lowly begin to understand the characters, and their heartbreak will become your heartbreak. You WILL shed tears over them, be those tears of enjoyment or sadness.
Enjoyment - 10
I shouldn't even have to justify my enjoyment at this point. I watched it in one sitting on a Saturday; by then end my eyes were red from the tears, and my face and abdomen hurt from the laughter.
Overall - 10
Toradora was everything I wanted from a romantic comedy drama, and more. I rate it 10, wishing it could go higher and sit above everything else on my list.",10
"
                THIS anime is a 1 only because Ryuuji gets beaten up by Taiga every single episode.
First of all Taiga is the worst anime character ever existed. At first you think she has anger issues but actually she is a CRIMINAL. She broke in a house and tried to kill Ryuuji. Not only that but she also did property damage.
I dont have a problem with tsunderes sometimes they are funny some times the are cute but Taiga crosses that line. I dont understand how could anyone fall in love with someone that beats you up and calls you his dog.
The other characters. Everyone in this anime
                  is a tsundere. Ryuuji is a masochist , Taiga is a criminal, Minori is just stupid. The only character I liked was Ami. She reminds me a lot of Teruhasi in saiki k.
If you watch it just be ready to be angry at Taiga every single episode",1

                Spoilers ahead and Tl;DR at the bottom
In this review I’m going to avoid talking about what the actually is show is and talk about what the point of it is. We have enough reviews that a half synopsis and half pointing out the obvious.
When most people are talking about toradora one of the first criticisms is that it is obvious who ends up with who, this baffles me as this is the whole point of the show. In the first episodes there is a painful amount about of foreshadowing to sort of spoil itself so that it can focus on its main theme, learning what
                  love really is.
Taiga and Ryuuji are both delusional when it comes to their crushes, at the begging Ryuuji talks about leaving the ’fantasy stage’ and moving on to the ‘action stage’ while having a box of items that relate to Minori and Taiga writes a love letter as if she is stuck in the 20th century. They both are mistaking their adoration for love and acting in such a way is entirely unnatural, just look at their bizarre plans to get the attention of there crushes in the first episodes. This is all done to show that they don’t really know what love actually is, Ryuuji has a crush on Minori because he idolizes her as this perfect ball of joy that can ‘fix’ his cynical attitude, but this doesn’t work the other way round, he doesn’t love Minori he love’s the idea of her or the persona she put out. It’s the same with Kitamura and Taiga, Taiga idolizes Kitamura as this flawless individual who can fix Taiga’s shortcomings even though that isn’t the case. They have both made an image of there respective crushes in their mind and have fallen in love with that. Throughout the series Taiga and Ryuuji are constantly proven that their ideas of their crush’s are wrong as their personas start to break down. The show is constantly showing that Taiga and Ryuuji complement each other and there is no idolization or no one person valuing their partner higher than themselves. Taiga and Ryuuji benefit each other equally and not has one side leaching of the other.
“You come to love not by finding the perfect person, but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly”
You could say a lot more about how each of the characters and events complement this dynamic but me saying that would just constantly be running in circles, at the end of the day this is a story about Taiga and Ryuuji and not the events that surround them.
TL;DR: Toradora isn’t a show about who ends up with who it’s a show about learning what love truly is and find the perfect couple that complement each other, not a one sided relationship of one leaching off the other.",9
"
                This anime has got one of the most emotionally moving scenes that will shake u to your core and send a grown man crying literally. One of its best romance / comedy anime genre
I'm writing this review short because anyone can truly grab the magnificant of toradora and dive into this anime as fast as possible:
The good points that makes toradora stands up in my opinion are:
1. Its seiyuu that put souls into the characters especially the female lead TAIGA!!!
2. Its comedic elements that drives the story forward without making it boring and its emotionally moving story (especially in episodes 14, 19, 24 and 25
                  )
3. Its main teachings of core value of life which are love, family and friendship, toradora excellently show that all these triats are co-dependent on each other to go through life smoothly.",10

                I usually don't take the time to review the shows I've watched. However, after watching Toradora! a second time and still enjoying every second of it, I felt compelled to give my thoughts on this wonderful anime in hopes that I might convince others to view one of my favorite shows.
N.B.: While I have tried not to include major spoilers in this review, I cannot promise that there are none, and there are certainly minor hints at the plot throughout. So, read on if you trust me to have kept it free of major spoilers, and if not, just trust my scoring, and go
                  watch this show.
Toradora! is a romantic comedy that provides plenty of each with a flawless balance of laughs and emotional, tear-jerking moments. The show follows high-schoolers Takasu Ryuuji and Aisaka Taiga as they help one another pursue their romantic goals. Along the way, the main characters and their friends make plenty of memories and discover their true inner feelings.  While perhaps somewhat predictable, the plot has plenty of twists and turns that will keep you entertained. The antics of the characters in their quests for love, belonging, and survival in high school truly made me laugh out loud, and the emotional scenes around the middle and through to the end made me glad to have a box of tissues next to me. Tackling motifs of not only romantic love but also the definition of family, Toradora! succeeds in making the viewer believe that even the problems of an individual high-school student can have incredible gravity in a young person's life. As far as the ending is concerned, it was quite satisfying.
The characters in this anime are a varied bunch and manage to be relatable while at the same time being over-the-top. Their motivations, while seeming straightforward, are generally complex and deeply emotionally rooted. The at-times eccentric behavior of the characters lets the viewer escape into a more colorful world than our own, and the characters never fail to be lovable.
The animation quality is very nice, and besides occasional awkward frames of facial expressions, I can think of few complaints. The sound, though, is worth raving about. The background music sets the mood perfectly and never gets old. The music for the emotional parts (“Lost My Pieces”) was especially spectacular and memorable. The openings set the tone of the show well, with the shift in openings occurring perfectly at one of the show’s great emotional shifts. The endings were cute and fitting, and truth-be-told I can't get any of the openings or endings out of my head (nor do I want to).
As far as complaints go, I have but a few. As mentioned earlier, the story is sometimes a bit predictable, though I really believe that I'm feeling this mostly in retrospect as the ending was by no means solidly in my mind throughout the series. Besides this complaint, the characters are often quite ambiguous when discussing their feelings and details about the various romantic situation. This ambiguity made for times when I would feel lost trying to interpret the characters’ words, and ultimately frustrated until explicit explanation was provided, if it even was. Also, on a very personal note, I felt dissatisfied about the end for a certain character (my favorite as it was).
Despite a few complaints, this show was a near perfect romantic comedy anime and was incredibly enjoyable to watch and rewatch. The show is quite frankly adorable. My only caveat is that once you finish it, you'll almost certainly wish you had more Toradora! to enjoy.",10
"
                The tsundere stereotype is often regarded predictable for its feelings and annoying for its stubbornness. But that is the charm of a tsundere; it's what absorbs the viewers, for better or for worse. Their personality is a major plot device for the entire story. And the target of their feelings is often dismissed but later acknowledged. 
The tsundere is a polarizing character. But not all tsunderes are made equal. In Toradora's case, the tsundere stereotype is given center stage and I am smitten by it.
These are my thoughts, of Toradora!
STORY
The story is absurd, cliche and most of all, predictable. The story is not quite an
                  original concept, but damn, they presented it so well that I get so emotionally attached in the end. From my experience, the initial plot was rather cringe-worthy but my enjoyment for the show raised after seeing each characters' progress and development. The main characters may not have achieved their original goal, but the ending proves that through frequent interactions and mutual understanding, people change for the better, or for worse. Though there are parts of the story that just seem TOO cliche for me watch that it can be a pain. Speaking of that ending, to say I'm satisfied is quite an understatement. But let just stay I was expecting something else, despite being quite predictable, but the show did great for surprising me repeatedly with some plot-twists and even some fight scenes between girls. (Ooops!)
In the end, the story is not what it seems at first. Perhaps this mainly due to fact that the story has 25-episodes to unfold itself. If it were the usual 12-episodes, the story would feel rushed and under-developed, and that's not good. Also, the subtitles didn't really did justice to the dialogue, at least from where I watched it. Fortunately the dub solved the issue. Overall, the story is interesting, comedic (though quite forced at times), and most importantly, just sweet. Oh, and lest I forget, I'M NOT BOTHERED BY THE FAN SERVICE! Yay, a first!
CHARACTERS
The cast of characters of Toradora! is quite the complex yet interesting bunch. Without going to each and every one of them, the one that received the most development was Ami, and therefore is the most interesting to see grow and mature, at least for me. In regards to the others, I'd say they are quite unpredictable, at least not Ryuuji, given how dense male main characters act. Either way, the story did great in emphasizing each character's personalities and as such, they shine in their own respective way. In the end, these are lovable characters, and thus characters you care for, even after the ending.
AESTHETICS & AUDIO
Toradora is produced by the studio of J.C. Staff in the years between 2008 and 2009. Even by today's standards, I'd say the visuals look great, even amazing at the time. The characters are well-drawn and animated and the backgrounds are colorful. One good thing about the show's aesthetics is how they just blend with everything and make thing look lively.
The soundtrack is decent at best and does justice to each respective scene its playing. The first batch of OP and ED are memorable but I can't say the same for the second batch. Overall, it's good but it could be better.
FINAL VERDICT
Toradora is memorable in every aspects, from the story to its characters. While it has been going along the waves of other rom-com shows, Toradora stands out for it's unpredictable storyline and complex characters. It's definitely a show to watch if you're not bothered by stereotypical characters like tsunderes, and some cliche features.
I wouldn't say it's the best anime I've watched, but in the romance genre, Toradora definitely  is the one that stands out, even now.",8
"
                *NOTE*
The title Toradora! is derived from the names of the two main characters Taiga Aisaka and Ryūji Takasu. Taiga sounds like tiger in English, and tiger in Japanese is tora (とら?). Ryūji literally means son of dragon in Japanese, and a transcription of the English word dragon into Japanese is doragon (ドラゴン?).
*REVIEW*
It was a great to be called extraordinary romantic comedy anime for me.
I certainly love the story and the whole package of this anime.
I like Taiga and Ryuji so much, and every time I remember them I smile XD
The twist behind the hidden love of each character gave me excitement to watch it and
                  wanting to have a season 2.
You must definitely not miss it to watch XD because for sure you will also enjoy it a lot. (Super!)
*PERSONAL IMPLICATION*
I find out and learn many things in this anime.
I know that all of us have issues in life that we surely want to settle or change and we can do it by the help of those people who love us (friends) that never leave us behind no matter what the situation will be.
Remember, running away won’t get you anywhere. Just face adversity of life because for me
“As long as there’s at least one person who understands me, I’ll be okay.”
Don’t  be afraid to try things, don’t be scared to do what you like to do since putting a lot of effort into something, you’ll definitely reap the rewards XD
And yes, being close to someone make you dependent to that person and rely at times on him/her like what happen to Taiga and Ryuji so at the end you didn’t notice but you fall in love to each other.
Lastly, try your BEST! Like a STAR in the sky who keep on shining brighter and brighter. ---TAIGA ",10

                TLDR Review: 
I personally have never particularly enjoyed the slice-of-life genre, I feel it takes a bit of an acquired taste, which I do not have. Though after watching and finishing Toradora it never even once crossed my mind that it was in fact a slice-of-life show. Now the show itself isn't particularly original in terms of character or story design, but for some reason I still enjoyed every minute of it. The show had me emotionally attached to the characters which is by no means an easy thing to do, especially if the show has already ended or is below the 26 episode mark.
                  Whether it be from the show’s simplicity itself or how the characters interact with one another. It manages to grasp your understanding of what a slice-of-life/ romantic comedy is and throws it out the window [In a School Days format (In a good way)]. For those of you that have yet to experience this show for yourself and are like myself, in terms of not “enjoying” slice-of-life, give it a shot. 
In Depth Review: 
Toradora is based off of the light novel written by Yuyuko Takemiya which was published from 2006-2009 and had a manga adaptation in 2007, illustrated by Zekkyo, which was eventually followed by an anime adaptation. Originally Toradora ran from October of 2008 to March of 2009, and was animated by J.C. Staff with 25 episodes. The show begins just like any other school show with our main character Ryuji Takasu, he is seen by his peers and even the rest of his school as just another delinquent. From this it is hard for him to make friends as everyone flees as soon as his gaze would meet theirs. His only friend at the beginning seems to be Kitamura as he finds what class he will be in for the year, though as he is walking to his class he ends up bumping into Aisaka Taiga. From this point the story begins, just like any other. 
Story: 8/10 
As for the story, it starts off hardly any different from your typical 6/10 school show; however, as the story progresses it becomes much more about everyone being happy and not just the protagonist getting what or who he wants. From them setting it up like just any other show, that in itself, is and was original for the time it came out as school shows such as this still are becoming stale, repetitive experiences. Toradora stands above these shows with an iron fist and tells those mediocre shows to dare follow in its footsteps. 
Characters: 9/10 
Characters are the biggest thing about a slice-of-life shows as they revolve around their daily lives and endeavors, thus it would have to be their strongest point. Toradora doesn't just develop the one main protagonist and love interest as so many shows do, it makes you feel for everyone involved in the story, side characters included. You continuously build an image behind every character and how they fit into and affect the story itself. That in itself is an achievement for a show. 
Art: 7/10 
Art can or cannot be the main focus of a slice-of-life as I've found, Toradora leans more towards the “can” side but not enough for it to take away from the characters or story. This could be either a good or a bad thing, since in amazingly animated shows you tend to look more at the animation and forget about the in-between conversations. Though this can be a downside, animation leaves more of a mark in your memory then dialogue does. Toradora isn't really that different in this aspect from pretty much any show you see today, but again it was animated almost 7 years ago. Back then this was beautiful animation and still is, it just can be easily disregarded nowadays unfortunately. 
Music/ Sound Design: 7/10 
As for music and sound design, aside from the intros and endings, they didn't particularly vary much from any other school show. Since more emphasis is put onto the character’s dialogue, music can be easily over-looked, though I feel this is for the better. Since again it really does not vary from typical shows. 
Overall: 8/10 
Toradora, for me, was about as refreshing of an experience as they come. I began to find myself in a rut in terms of romance shows as they all begin and end the same; however, my faith was restored after finishing this show. Toradora may have seemed like all the rest, which may have been the reason why I had avoided it for so long, sometimes it’s a good thing to be wrong. You may have to tread through many fields and many miles of mediocrity to find that one genre defining title, in a genre such as slice-of-life that isn't typically varied to begin with, Toradora is easily among the elite in its respective genre. Slice-of-life surely isn't a genre for anyone as I have found that lesson out the hard way, but there is always that one title that just for whatever reason stands above all of the rest. Toradora may not be for everyone since nothing is, but it gets damn near close, so if you’re pissed like me and need a good show to watch regardless of your preferences, give it a shot.",8
"
                For some shows, I feel it necessary to go through each category and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. But for this one, I was really only left with two significant realizations:
1. Watching Toradora! is like taking a stallion's dose of viagra just before strolling through a Renaissance art gallery. Never, in my entire life, have I seen a show that draws out the sexual tension between its characters for so long. The cruelty of this phenomenon, however, was intensely refreshing. Most other shows in the same genre rely solely on eye candy to hold their viewers' attention; Toradora! simply refuses to do that- and with
                  good reason. It's as if the producers are shouting, ""look, everyone- we've got great voice actors, great music, great character development, and a great plot- so we're not going to spam cleavage every two minutes and risk having you miss out on all the good stuff.""
2. If you're similar to me, you probably don't like a few specific genres. Not just anime genres- I'm talking about all forms of art. For instance, I don't particularly like country music, modern art, or- and here's where I retain topical relevance- romance anime. I mean, seriously. Nine times out of ten, animated romcoms make me feel like a perverted, balding sociopath. Or at least, I'm pretty sure that they would if I had actually watched ten of them (and I definitely haven't). But the thing is, every genre has at least a couple masterpieces- art that even the snobbiest critics can't help but appreciate. Well, Toradora! is definitely one of the few exceptions to my hatred for romantic anime. The reason I bring this up is to encourage those of you who are on the fence to give it a try. People who normally like romcoms have already seen it ages ago; but I can almost guarantee that you'll enjoy it, too- regardless of how cynical you may be.",8
"
                Before i begin this review I just wanted to say this is my first review so go easy on me. I actually watched this anime quite some time ago, but when I started thinking about I felt that I had to just go back and give it a proper review.
Since Toradora! is such a special anime to me this review may be a little bias, but that's alright :)
Story- Toradora! is your typical high school anime story where boy meets girl and they fall in love, develop strong relationships with those around them and start to open up to the world. This does happen in
                  a lot of other animes, but the way Toradora portrayed it was simply unique. Story = 8/10
Art- The artwork in Toradora! was refreshing, it was bolder than most animes I've seen. I really liked the way the characters were drawn it gave them a breath of life almost. Art = 10/10
Sounds- Most reviews seem to focus on the OPs and EDs, but I'm going to venture a little further. Toradora! did have two OPs/EDs i didn't really enjoy the first OP, but  i did enjoy the other three. What really made the difference for me was the soundtrack. With songs such as ""Ame iro rondo"", ""Lost my pieces"", ""Start up"", ""yasashisa no ashioto"" to name a few, they really add to the scene they're being played in. Sounds = 9/10 
Character- Characters are the most important part of this show, they flesh out in what direction the show is going to be moving towards. They are also the ""connectors"" to the audience. In that sense this is way I find the show Toradora! so special, on a personal level I was able to relate with the characters of the show on such a level that it was almost as I was there with them. The one character i could relate with the most was Ryuuji, his lifestyle is so similar to mine (other than the fact i don't live anywhere near them). Since I live with just my Mom and younger brother, I find myself in his situation a lot. The second part i really enjoyed about Toradora! was how strong the bonds of friendship were. They always were looking out for each other no matter what the situation was, to the point of sacrificing their own happiness. Characters = 10/10
Enjoyment- From everything i said from above, I think you guys know what this is going to be rated. But I really enjoyed each and every episode, for myself personally the connection i developed with this show is enough to make me tear up just from hearing a song from the soundtrack. This show was something i was only able to experience once. Upon that being said when i finished this show, I went into an ""anti-anime depression"" and was unable to enjoy a good anime for a couple of months (yep that's how hard this show hit me). Enjoyment = 10/10
Overall- Overall i really think Toradora! is a fantastic anime, I think all fans of Romance/Drama/Comedy should watch it. You might enjoy it as much as I did maybe not, but I can say you won't be disappointed by it.",10
"
                I tend to watch a lot of Romcoms Animes. I've always enjoyed some of the slice of life aspects and certain themes. At this moment in time, without a doubt, Toradora is one of my favorite Animes! I got hooked and binged watch the whole season in the summer of 2019 and have re-watched it multiple times.
The story has a great plot and interesting premise which involves one of the main characters, a high school kid named Ryuuji Takasu. And another main character who is a short, hot-headed girl named Aisaka Taiga, who is also a high school student. Aisaka Taiga, who has a big
                  crush on Ryuuji's best friend, Yuusaka Kitamura. While Ryuuji has a crush on Aisaka friend Minori Kushieda. The two plan and try to help each other out and achieve their goals. But as the story continues they're more characters who are introduced and play apart of the story. Throughout Toradora's story the plot slowly turns into a emotional, light-hearted, romantic, comedy, drama, driven Anime!
A majority of the characters are not perfect and have to deal with stress, drama, and be thrown into overwhelming situations throughout the season. Despite that the characters in the story can be two dimensional at times. But they have a lot more depth to them later when the story really sinks in. The characters are all pretty likable with their weird quirks and funny moments, especially Aisaka Taiga. She went through the most change and was by far my favorite character in Toradora!
The soundtrack is fantastic my personal favorite song is ""Lost My Pieces"", this song sounds so beautiful! 
I loved the comedy in Toradora I guess it resonated with me and had me laughing pretty hard at times. Toradora was very emotional and I wanted more when it ended. The art-style is so colorful still looks great a decade later. Granted not everybody is going to like Toradora because it has a tsundere and lackluster writing. Whatever that is totally fine but you can't change my mind I love Toradora! Even know I Love Toradora it is not perfect and has some flaws but what can you expect for anime that released in 2008.
Overall Toradora is a 10/10 in my books. And I heavily recommend to at least try to watch it!",10
"
                Well, Toradora was amazing. First, the characters developement through the series was so natural and perfect, also of course Ryuuji's and Taiga's relationship. 
I just finished it and I want to screAM. Their final kiss was the most original and cutest kiss ever aah I want a guy like Ryuuji, okay.
Everything was amazing, the story, you never got bored, there were some gaps in the art but anyway it was amazing.

"
                Ima start you off with this teaser
AAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIISSSAAAAAAAAAAKKKAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!
You're going to hear this at some point in the series, at least once. 
Story: 6 
The story leads off with a couple of ""misfits"" in high school, Ryūji Takasu and Taiga Aisaka, both struggling to fit in while at the same time must live in the shadow of their respective crushes. As luck (...or perhaps fate) would have it, Taiga's crush happens to be Ryuji's best friend, Yūsaku Kitamura, and Ryuji's crush happens to be Taiga's best friend Minori Kushieda. A perfect storm for brewing an unexpected romance. For those of you sensitive to spoilers, I will say
                  no more. However, I will make no secret that in my opinion, the plot is mediocre at best, relying on a flurry of convenient plot devices and occasional plot twists to drive the story along...at least, in the first half of the series. 
The story however, does pick up in the second half of the series (somewhere after episode 13 or so), with a combination of strong character developments from previously 1-dimensional characters and organically grown relationships between characters previously left unexplored in the 1st half of the series. While the narrative itself remained fairly simple, these developments in character and their relationships definitely made the series more enjoyable. I have more comments about the characters later in this review
Art (and Animation): 7
Character designs were fairly simple, nothing over the top or overly detailed, but easily remembered. whether it is Ryuji's blue hair and small sanpaku, or the fact that Taiga is 2 feet tall. 
I'm also not too big a stickler for frame rates when it comes to non-theatrical release anime, so I would say the animation was fairly good as well, and drops in frame rates (if any) are hardly noticeable once the viewer becomes immersed in the story. For those of you who don't pay too much attention to animation details, I can give a few examples. 
Studio Ghibli typically puts a lot of budget into their feature length films, thus making character movement seem incredibly fluid and organic, whereas the studio that created Toradora cannot afford to put as many resources into each episode since there are simply too many, and thus have to cut back on animation. While I contend that you won't notice much issue with frames just by watching Toradora, if you compared it to a ghibli film, the discrepancy is quite pronounced. 
Sound: 7
There are 2 opening themes and 2 ending themes. Even after having watched this anime 2 years ago, I can still remember them exactly from beginning to end (minus the lyrics, as I do not know japanese). To some that may seem weird and obsessive, but I would argue that the music in this series are actually quite catchy, and more importantly, fit the nature of the show ( very girly as well as cute and endearing). That being said, while the theme songs were memorable, they weren't quite my cup of tea as far as music preferences go, so I could not bring myself to give it an outstanding score. Feel free to add 1 or 2 points on your personal scale if your music tastes fit this niche. 
As far as sound effects go, I have very few comments. Nothing sounded particularly out of place. However, I tend not to pay too much to sounds affects as so much the story itself. If my you notice any sound issues which are out of sync with my apparently lenient comments, feel free 2 give me feedback on my profile page.....and yes, puns absolutely intended. 
Character: 8 
While I always look to enjoy a good story, I place an even higher value on the characters that drive the narrative. I also feel that Toradora provides excellent examples of both good and bad character development. Allow me to list a few examples without spoiling too much. 
The good: 
- Unique main male protagonist with unique lifestyle and idiosyncrasies that really break the mold regarding male characters in Shonen anime.  
- Many of the supporting characters introduced throughout the 1st half of the series end up playing major roles in the 2nd half, and thus makes the series a lot more interesting and vibrant. 
- The 2nd half has a lot of drama...however, much of that drama is evenly paced (not blown up all at once in a few minutes), believable, and does a good job of drawing sympathy from the viewers.
- The payoff at the end is quite fulfilling for those who make it through all 25 episodes (resist urge to look up plot synopsis please!!!) 
The bad: 
- Inconsistent character development in the 1st few episodes. The series introduces our 2 main characters as outcasts in some shape or form, but those aspects of their characters seem to get tossed by the wayside without ever being revisited. Not a crippling issue for me, but it may bother and confuse some who seek to sympathize with the characters. 
- 1 dimensional supporting cast whose traits may be fun and interesting to watch for the first few episodes, but may also start to annoy and irk you halfway through the series from their repetitiveness. 
Can be Good or Bad (depending on your taste) 
-The main female protagonist is a Tsundere voiced by Rie Kugumiya, the queen voice actress for other famous Tsundere's like Shana from ""Shakugan no Shana"" and Louise from ""Zero no Tsukaima"". I will note that she also performs vocals for the 1st opening theme in Toradora. Due to the polarizing nature of this character archetype, I will leave it up to you all to decide whether or not you enjoy the main female lead of Toradora. 
While I did spend a lot of time bashing the 1st half while praising the 2nd half of the series, looking at the show as whole, the character development was actually quite solid in my opinion. In a lot of ways, the 2nd half helped to reaffirm a lot of the weaker points early on in the series, in both a plotwise and thematic sense. 
Enjoyment: 7
Despite my quips and concerns with certain aspects of the show, I would like to say once again that the payoff towards the end of the show is definitely worth whatever frustrations and tribulations you may have to endure at the beginning. And for those of you who are looking for a cute show with cute characters doing cute things, I might enjoy the 1st half (certainly more than I did). 
J.C.Staff, the production studio also known for producing the ""Toaru Majutsu no Index"" series and ""Toaru Kagaku no Railgun"" spinoff, isn't quite on par with Sunrise and Madhouse just yet, but they definitely showed a lot of potential with Toradora, and I look forward to writing more reviews about their work in future. 
ONE LAST NOTE
I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD MARK THIS AS HELPFUL/UNHELPFUL 
I've only recently started writing reviews and would like to improve my craft, so constructive criticisms on my profile page would be much appreciated !
Hope you enjoyed this review, and I hope you will enjoy this series!!",7
"
                First of all, if you don't think you'll like it, watch it anyway. I started off thinking this was a cheap, silly romcom anime that was for romance fans or people who were easily impressed... I was wrong!
Story: 10/10
The story is about love triangles/squares/dodecahedrons... I lost count midway through the anime. However, it's also deep, emotional, full of moral conflicts and struggles which brought out the true personality of all five of the main characters. It's rare for a short anime such as this to achieve such in-depth back story and development between the characters, and it's lovely to see real chemistry between them. I've
                  seen a couple of romance anime in my time and even though Toradora is not solely 'romance',  it can still be regarded as a top runner in the world of romance anime. What I liked especially about the story is the ability to show one act as being morally right, and for the viewer to agree with it, and then later on, show that actually that was the wrong thing to do. Consequently it made me think very much about right and wrong and what things I myself could do and stop doing to improve my personality and become a better person. Since Ryuuji is constantly trying to do right, I was constantly asking myself, ""Is this what I would do in that situation?"".
While it may not be for everyone, and a lot of people most likely didn't look that deep, I enjoyed this moral aspect of the show. 
Toradora also managed to be funny, exciting, scary and so happy it gave me tears of joy and for that I am very grateful to Toradora. 
Art: 7/10
Unlike shows like AoT, No Game No Life and Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, the art in Toradora is nothing special. It's generic and really doesn't ask to be admired. In a way, it's obvious the creators of this show wanted to work more on story than art, and that's fine. It didn't add, or take away from the overall experience of Toradora. Character design was fairly good though, as the girls looked cute, and the facial expressions were good, but again, nothing to shake a stick at.
Sound: 7/10
The opening and closing songs of this anime were pretty cool. It wasn't the sort of music I would listen to normally, but it was good enough that I sat through the intro and ending during each episode... that is until halfway through and as if by universal law, the second OP and ED were worse than the first two. They weren't awful, but I chose to skip them then. Music throughout the anime was ok. The music was suitable for the mood, and generally helped towards making it more enjoyable, however it was again mediocre. I won't be downloading the soundtrack to this anime.
Character: 9/10
As I said in the story part, in my opinion, character development in Toradora is one of it's strong points. The five main characters all have a good amount of back story and character development. I felt I could easily sympathise and connect with them. It's an aspect of storytelling that is often left out of short anime and so I congratulate the original authors, writers and directors of Toradora for doing so well on this front. I also think that the characters are all fairly likeable. They all have motives, opinions and their own morals which create a fascinating dynamic throughout the group and thus, is very entertaining. 
[One final point] This show can get confused. There's a lot going on and so near the end, the ideals, morals and dynamics get a little confused and slightly rushed at the end. I feel like a lot happened at the end that wasn't fully explained and for that reason alone, I did not give this anime 10/10.
Overall:
This is not the best anime ever, but it's certainly up there! I feel like it will appeal to wide audiences and get people very engrossed in the show. I recommend this show to all anime fans, regardless of previous preferences. Watch the first episode, and if you don't like it, then don't watch it.",9

                Short review: If you like romance watch it now.
Long review: This is the 2nd best romance anime I've ever seen (my first being clannad after story). I honestly would probably recommend this over clannad though and let me explain why. Unlike clannad Toradora is only 25 episodes and it is quicker and easier to get in to for probably most people. Now on to my real review for this anime. First of all the story. At first I thought this was going to be your everyday romance anime story but it became so much more than that. There is plenty of moments that will make
                  you smile and laugh, but then there is the moments that will make you lay down and cry in to your pillow. Also unlike most romance anime I've seen the ending is sooo satisfying. On to the art. I don't have too much to say about the art. It is a very nice anime to look at. It isn't the best art I have ever since even though it has its moments of brilliance. The art isn't very good that is all have to say about it. Now the characters. The two main characters (Ryuji and Taiga) are very memorable. Especially Taiga. Taiga is a tsundere but not a annoying one like some of them. She is one of my favorite girl characters in anime just take my word for it that she is awesome. I very much enjoyed this anime. It felt amazing to sit and watch this whole anime in a weekend. If you enjoy romance this is a must.",9
"
                Story: 9/10
The story is basically the two main characters falling for two other people and help each other to get close to their crushes. Over time, they fall in love with each other. They find new friends and build new relationships. The story is short, sweet, and simple while relying on the character's interactions as a major driving force of the anime.
Art: 8/10
The art was colorful and vivid which is vital for me when watching an anime.
Sound: 8/10
The sound was good and the voice acting. The first opening's melody and tune really got stuck in my head.
Character: 9/10
The anime as I said, is built on
                  character interactions. The characters are also unique like Yusaku.
Enjoyment: 8/10
I really enjoyed this anime even thought I prefer fantasy, sword fighting, magic using anime. So, yeah. It's good. Go watch it.
Overall: 9/10
So, as I said, the anime is good and worth watching. Also, Taiga is so cute. Please just watch it for yourself. Go now.",9
"
                well very first review
so i should start by saying one of the BEST anime ever watched 
STORY: close enough to being perfect, very touching sides and very funny at the same time
ART: Excellently made cool graphics
SOUND: well comsa comsa should i say.CHARACTERS: attractive espacially TAIGA
ENJOYMENT: TO THE MAX!!!!
overall rating: 10
why?
here's one reason it is because my life was the same to the story
eheheheh say it coincidental but its true its very similar on how i met my fiancee  right now. we had hardships, struggles, painful encounter but in the end love still conquered everything. 
every person has each unique story in life may it be painful or joy as long as u still stood i n your own two feet you can go a long way, like Taiga family problems didn't hinder her from creating her own life, this is what the story is telling the viewers.",10
"
                Cute and Funny
Toradora is a cute little romance that can be really hilarious. Its not difficult to see were the show is going after the first couple of episodes but this doesn't make it less enjoyable. The five main characters are really great, they al feel really natural, of course with an eccentric twist to make them more interesting and fun, and by the end of the series you can tell the growth they had since the beginning.
The plot is not to complicated, its a high school romance, but what really sells it is the every day life and the little situations and problems the
                  characters are faced with and at moments the big emotional moments that might bring a tear to your eyes. The sound is great, with a few emotional songs that enhance the few sad moments, and lot of up beat atmospheric songs that make Toradora a really feel good show. The colorful style and nice animation gives a lot of life and energy to it.
As good as the show is, the target audience is really limited, and Toradora might not appeal to every body. If you are not invested in the romance genre or don't care about high school life you might not like it.",8
"
                Although it may just seem like another typical school-romance anime at first, it develops so much more nicely than others.
I thoroughly enjoyed Toradora, at first it being light entertainment. As a guy who doesn't like the average romance-drama anime, in the later episodes, I became teary-eyed from the suspense, anticipation, and drama of the show. Every episode has small events or occurrences in dialogue that may seem slight at first but can abuse your emotions by being acknowledged as a severe mistake in later episodes, epic metaphors that you become attached to being shot down by a sentence spoken by a person who thinks they
                  are above it all. In a sense the characters have different tiers of knowledge in the situations and judgement, the watcher you and I being the second to highest tier, it is truly interesting.
The art style was unique and did it's job, it drew me into the story and took a grasp of my consciousness as it created the world of the character's lives, the animation lessened in detail in action-filled scenes greatly increasing the intensity and the quality of the animation itself, done greatly.
The characters were all unique each having their fatal flaw, though not as severe as Greek theatre, it was just severe for us to recognize them if we read in between the lines. This greatly strengthened the bond between the watcher and the character, I really loved almost every singly one of the characters, even though they were hate-able at certain points.  
Through and through I recommend this anime to anyone who can tolerate school genres or even people who can't because it doesn't center on the school very much at all, the anime completely gravitates around the characters and their lives, each one has complete depth and makes the anime amazingly enjoyable, although the ending seemed like it was made to spite the watchers emotions, it succeeded in squeezing out a few last tears as we transition away from an amazing anime.",10
"
                When I first started watching this anime I was expecting just another anime that would just give me a couple of laughs, but what I found after watching this was much much more. As soon as I finished the anime I can say without dought that this is the one my favorite anime ever. 
It has one of the most realistic romance story (in my opinion), and it's amazing how the characters develop during the series.  
I won't make this review too long, so i'll just make this short then GO WATCH IT!!!
enjoy it everyone ^_^

"
                I've never really favored a lot of romance anime's and I was a little reluctant to watch this at first because I've already been battered by one boring, campy romance anime after the other and there are a lot of mixed opinions about this show so I'm going to be as fair as I can be with this show.
Story:
This show is about two people that try to hook up with each other's friends and help each other out, but fall in love in the process.
Impression:
O.K compared to most romance anime's this wasn't really campy and boring, granted I couldn't say that the premiss was original
                  but it seemed like it had taken the basic idea and polished it.
a lot of the time I usually dread anime's like this that are 25 episodes but every episode was fleshed out and did it's part in the story though some a little more than others. The show also did a very good job at developing characters and actually getting me to care about them and by the end of the series I started looking back at the first few episodes and thinking of how far these characters have come. 
The comedy was a little ""meh"" for me though there were a few moments that were worthy of a laugh but it depends on your sense of humor though I didn't particularly like the comedy aspect.
Something to keep in mind is that halfway through, this anime gets a little dramatic, though I kinda liked it because it felt climatic and it helped keep the show from being all same old same old, so just as a heads up, it's dramatic towards the end.
All in all this was a pretty satisfying as a romance anime that goes a little further than other anime's I've seen.
Characters:
To start off there is Ryuji Takasu who is feared among many for the way his eyes look and Tiaga Aisaka who is feared for her angry disposition and overall aggressiveness. Takasu wasn't boring like a lot of other male leads in romance anime but I can't really say he was my favorite but he did show that he had some kind of goal and at times had to play the adult when Tiaga wasn't and at times was there for her and as for Tiaga she was your typical Tsundere (bitch with a heart), but one thing they both had in common was to some extent they had abandonment and family issues which helped them relate to one another as the series went on and as their relationship continued to develop.
Then there is Minori Kushieda who is Takasu's main crush, Minori is energetic but is more serious as the show gets more dramatic. the only problem I had with her character was that it didn't make any sense why Takasu was into her and their relationship seemed limited and distant most of the time.
As for Tiaga's crush it was Yusaku Kitamura who was your typical glasses character though at times he was entertaining I never really felt all that close to his character but I think that might be the dilemma with a lot of glasses characters.
Finally there is Ami Kawashima who is kind of a bitch, I'll leave it at that and just let the show take over because she does develop from that point.
Sub vs. Dub:
Yes there actually is a dub that came out recently, and in comparison to the sub, it really didn't matter which version I was watching they both had the same effect to me, so if you like watching dubs then you won't be disappointed, and as for the Japanese V.A they were pretty good considering that I kinda hate listening to the Japanese voice acting in most high school based anime's but the  sub held up and there really weren't any weak ends on the english dub so both performances are pretty solid, both having compiled very good voice actors so take your pick.
Final verdict:
I'm giving this one an 8/10,
So as far as romance anime's this was probably my favorite but take into consideration of what I said earlier about the drama, and the fact that I'm not super into these kind of anime.",8
"
                Okay guys, first thing you might say is, ""Oh another romance/comedy"" kind of anime again. It is, but Toradora! breaks the RomCom boundaries and leaves you wanting more. I loved this series, at times it ""Aww that was too cute"", at times it was like, ""Dude pull your head out of your ass."" But you know how our teenage times were, especially with something like love. It's hard to expect the majority of people at that age to realize something that's right in front of them. But enough of my blabbering on, let's go on to the review!
Story: 8/10
The story was fairly simple. I won't
                  really get into the story as the synopsis is right above us. But our main character Ryuuji meets Taiga. Ryuuji likes Taiga's friend and vice versa with Taiga likes Ryuuji's friend. From there, there's drama, romance, comedy, and much more! Too put it simply, it was a 25 episode roller coaster of feelings circulating between five of the main characters.
Art: 8/10
The art wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst. It didn't bother me while I watched. The art was different in a sense from all the different animes out there. There weren't really any negatives about the art either.
Sound: 10/10
I absolutely loved the soundtrack from Toradora! From the two op's to the two endings. It was beautiful. Throughout the whole series the soundtracks that played really fit the moment. It was a variety of different soundtracks to extremely up-beat to very depressing. The sound for Toradora! was amazing.
Character: 10/10
The characters were magnificent. Even though not all were likable (In my eyes) the characters were carefully thought out. On one you have the bully of the school, Taiga. Ryuuiji, with the eyes of a delinquent but he's really not. The three others I won't explain, I feel it would spoil the story for some. The development was also magnificent, from start to finish they all get to show their true colors. This series even proves you wrong from first impressions. Overall, the characters were the strong point of this anime.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Loved this anime, even wanting more after the 25 episode run. It entertained me throughout the entire series. The feelings you can relate to because they're all what we felt before. Jealousy, rejection, happiness, etc., all get to you. The series it flat-out entertaining if you love Romance/Comedy genres. To the people who really don't like that genre, Toradora! will probably change your mind about that. Enjoyed this anime 100%.
I suggest everyone give it a try if you haven't already :)",10
"
                Toradora! tells the story of Takasu Ryuuji and Aisaka Taiga, who happen to have crushes on each others’ best friends. They agree to set each other up, but over time, their relationship with each other begins to flourish as well. Many commonplace settings and situations typical of your average romantic comedy are used in the plots of the episodes, such as pool days, beach houses, culture festivals, etc., so many of the situations here aren’t exactly unique. Instead, Toradora! focuses heavily on character development. The show can be divided into three parts: the light-hearted initial episodes, the middle mini-arcs, and the ending. The first couple
                  episodes are much more focused on comedy, which is okay but not great, than on romance or drama. The middle episodes have a ton of character development, though there’s also quite a bit of melodramatic dialogue that made it hard to watch. Finally, there’s the ending, which amalgamates all that development we saw into a superb finish. This was easily the most emotional part of the show, and I was quite surprised at the number of tearjerking scenes there were considering its initial tone.
The characters are some of the deepest and most complex I’ve seen in any romantic comedy anime. Their personas cannot be described in just a few words. In this show, you can’t judge a book by its cover. Viewers and others characters in the show may attribute certain personality traits to each of the main characters, but they aren’t always what they seem. 
Ryuuji, the male protagonist, always looks like a pissed-off delinquent because of the eyes he inherited from his late father. In fact, he is a gentle, caring guy who does most of the house work around his household, including the cooking. However, most people are quick to misunderstand him because they’re usually too intimidated to even talk to him. His self-esteem is usually low as a result, and though he is smart, he doesn’t seem to understand himself very well. Despite their polar personalities, it seems suitable that one of the few people to even associate with him is the domineering and irascible tsundere Taiga. Their relationship is certainly unique. While they strive to help each other fulfill their hearts’ desires, they have almost a master-servant relationship, with Taiga often derogatively referring to Ryuuji as a dog or mongrel. Nonetheless, Taiga, who lives alone and can barely take care of herself, develops a reliance on Ryuuji to take care of her and comfort her when she is troubled. Likewise, Ryuuji becomes almost like a father, as one character puts it, to Taiga, worrying about her when she is away.
Then there’re the three other main characters. Kushieda Minori is Taiga’s best friend and the one Ryuuji is chasing after. In my opinion, she’s the most fascinating and complex character of the show. Seemingly an eccentric ditz, she has an ostensible cheerfulness. But when she removes this probable façade, she is shown to have remarkable acumen on this love pentagon. Even she can get riled or depressed under times of distress and it is implied that she puts on her optimistic smile in order to forget and move on. She’s also very caring for others, especially Taiga, and will not hesitate to admirably sacrifice her own desires to support Taiga’s. Taiga’s love interest, Kitamura Yuusaku, is probably the weakest character. He’s friends with everyone in the group but doesn’t exactly have incredibly strong relationships with them, and it seems like his main purpose is to act as a foil to Taiga’s character and balance out the gender ratio of the group. Not that he is unnecessary, but his character development didn’t need to be as comprehensive as it was. And finally, there’s Kawashima Ami. She’s a conceited person acting under the pretense of being considerate and benevolent. However, becoming interested in Ryuuji herself, she possesses the strongest insight of the relationships between the characters, and her profound words to the other characters act as driving forces for their developments and the overall plot. Another major character is Ryuuji’s mother, who becomes significant towards the end. She is childish but is the sole financial supporter for the family. Ultimately, she becomes one of the reasons why I liked the ending so much.
One problem I found with the characters though is their tendency to exaggerate the gravity of their issues (both romantic and general) and overreact to them. Perhaps it’s because of cultural differences, but it seemed kind of strange that their reactions were sometimes so extreme, even for teenagers. For example, Taiga’s near-hatred for her father seemed unwarranted. I mean he’s not a great father, but Taiga abandoned her home on her own will, so the fact that he’s providing her money and wants to see her means that he cares about her somewhat.
As for sound and visuals, they’re standard fare for the most part. Animation is decent, but it looks like a typical modern anime. The background music is great for the emotional scenes, but I’m not a fan of the type of music played for the OP’s and ED’s, so I can’t judge them fairly.
Toradora! is one of the better romantic comedy anime out there. It falls into many traps common with romantic comedies (melodrama, clichéd dialogue, etc.), but makes up for them with strong characterization. While starting out comedic in nature, the show gradually becomes more dramatic as the characters’ relationships are explored. The final few episodes are fantastic (the reason why I bumped this to an 8), retaining the emotion of the middle episodes while brushing away the corny melodrama. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to indulge in a romantic comedy anime. To those ambivalent to the genre, it’s a nice show to try. It’s definitely inspired hope in me for a relatively weak genre full of insipidity.",8
"
                If I had to describe Toradora! in four words, it would probably be: Stereotypical anime done right.
The story of the romantic struggles and conflicts of a group of high school friends, Toradora! seems to barely stray away from the common cliches of high school romcom anime. From a plot perspective, there's hardly anything exciting about the anime with such a predictable turn of events. The main heroine is a tsundere. Whoa! Never saw that one before! And let's not forget the pivotal culture festival, Christmas, and Valentine's Day scenes that exists in EVERY SINGLE high school romance (looking at you, Shana).
What we as anime viewers
                  may not be aware of is that all these common cliches are not signs of bad writing, or lack of creativity. In fact, it would be quite stupid not to include such climatic and exciting events of a school year if the anime was situated at school. A tsundere main always makes things more exciting and allows the anime to leverage a wide range of emotions. The reason why these aspects are often frowned upon is that anime creators have taken these ideas and concepts and treated them as cookie cutters instead of baking instructions. Rather than use these ideas as launching pads for their own styles, anime makers have simply plopped characters and stories into these molds without bothering to really make it theirs, uniquely theirs. Anime, instead of being an artistic creation like a song or a painting, is mass-produced like a model of a car or an industry-standard table.
Not Toradora.
Toradora! takes the basic plot of the romcom and breathes the breath of life into the characters, into the events, into the very atmosphere of the anime. Not afraid to be cliche, not afraid to be unique, Toradora! stands firm and resolute as its own unique story, its own special drawing, its own melodic song. It is a classic among anime.
Story (8/10)
Art (9/10)
Sound (8/10)
Character (10/10)
Enjoyment (9/10)
Toradora!'s story is ridiculously predictable. A girl likes a guy who is a friend of a guy who likes a friend of the girl's. The former girl and the latter guy team up to help each other find their loves. At this point, it should almost be a given that the two of them are going to fall for each other. Ryuuji and Taiga don't even try to hide it in the first episode, making weird smirks and grins at each other at school. Sure, Ami is introduced into the fray but is almost immediately dismissed as someone non-influential (from a romantic sense).
Everything goes according to an obvious plan. And that's what made the anime such an exciting watch.
When I first saw Ryuuji and Taiga, I thought they were made for each other...wait, that's true...Anyways, I wanted to see them get paired up since their pair dynamic was just simply awesome. But I then immediately recalled a few anime (COUGH COUGH MASHIROIRO SYMPHONY) where the main heroine actually doesn't become the chosen girl. I spent the entire anime praying that this would not be the case, and was overjoyed when Taiga confessed her love to Ryuuji.
In a way, the obvious predictability of the anime made me more aware of the possible divergences the anime could have taken that would have made it a total disaster. In the end, I gained a new appreciation for anime that doesn't try to stupidly make something original without giving a care for quality or consequence.
I loved the art. Taiga's character design is simply beautiful - the way her hair juxtaposes her figure, the way her eyes grace her pose. Her smile is simply enchanting. Ryuuji is one of the first protagonist designs that I airfisted for: finally, a main character with a notable characteristic! Those eyes are killer, and really make him seem like a ""dragon"" type character. The anime also has some very nice environment and object designs, like the shining Christmas tree.
Although, is it just me, or does did Taiga's getup at the Christmas party look really bad...?
The soundtrack was quite a grab bag. Pre-parade has a very weird and unique sound for a romcom anime. My Silky Heart seemed to be a better fit, although both were wonderfully done OPs. The winning ticket has to go to Orange, however, for best song in the series. The actual anime has some good music to back up the scenes - nothing extraordinary, however. Personally, I think the insert song could have also been better. The seiyuus are all wonderful, in particular Kugimiya Rie aka Ms. Tsundere, voice of Shana and Louise.
Now let's talk about where Toradora! trumps all other anime of similar genre: character.
Character design is where about 90% of the common romcom anime fail. They create the standard plot with the standard events and standard characters, and then do NOTHING ELSE with the characters, leaving them static for the entire anime.
In contrast, every main character in Toradora! is dynamic.
Let's start with Ryuuji. As typical for a protagonist, he has an urge to protect and support the girls around him, especially Taiga. He begins the anime as a kid with a mean glare but a very timid interior, lacking both resolve and confidence. Over the course of the anime and his relationship with Taiga, he slowly begins to be accepted with his looks as he changes his character from within. Clapping at the culture festival, dressing up as Santa Bear; all these are examples of Ryuuji's character changing positively because of Taiga. By the end of the anime, not only is he accepted by those who once rejected him, but he also has found a purpose in his life where he once had no goal.
Taiga, Taiga, Taiga. Ms. Tsundere, you have truly given life to another wonderful character. Taiga starts of the anime as a prototypical violent tsundere. I had little hope that this tiny girl would actually change her persona, but I was delighted to be completely wrong. Just as her namesake changes colors and appearance through the seasons, Taiga grows and matures (never physically, though!) and becomes a lovable character. When the anime hit winter, I was wondering if it was still the same girl I was watching. Even still, they kept her fighting tiger spirit alive until the very last headbutt.
Minori is an interesting side character. My initial prediction was that she actually liked Yuusaku, but that was quickly rebuffed. Her relationship with Taiga is a mystery but gives her a wonderful reason to become a dynamic side character. Her energy is a driving force in the anime, as are her tears. Minori feels similar to Taiga, but has the will and the drive to make herself happy by her own hands without necessarily relying on even another's love. A great supporting character and love rival, really refreshing to watch (vs. someone like Siesta).
Yuusaku basically steals the spotilght for a quarter of the episodes. With his own love issues and conflicts, Yuusaku shows that a side character can still get major attention in anime. He acts as the voice of reason for the group, as well as another source of energy like Minori. He also likes running around shirtless.
I had slightly different expectations for Ami, but in the end I'm not disappointed. More than anything, I expected her to put on more of a show, to give more of a fight. Instead, she naturally accepts things as they are and goes with the flow, which is...totally unprecedented with her given character mold. She's supposed to be the girl that potentially steals the protagonist, but she barely even steals his attention. However, her relationship with Taiga and the rest of the cast allows her to mature as a person, and ultimately allows her to accept herself as she is. She may resign herself from romance, but she ultimately discovers the precious gift called friendship which is enough to make her happy.
The rest of the cast plays important supporting roles. Even the teacher makes an important and meaningful speech at the end. The characters truly brought the anime alive in a way I never thought was possible.
Holistically, the anime was a complete package, wrapped with ribbons and all. The beginning of the anime was intriguing, captivating, and made you want to follow how Ryuuji and Taiga were going to get along despite knowing the obvious conclusion. This anime had the best kiss scene of any anime ever. Easily. The resolution was also perfect, wholly wrapping up the anime with no holes and leaving with a light and breezy feeling. A great anime ending that left me perfectly happy and at ease.
Overall (9/10)
Toradora! deserves to be part of the prestigious top 100 on MAL, and will undoubtedly be a classic anime for years to come. I hope other anime producers will see and be inspired by this anime, so that Toradora! will not be the last of its kind, of anime that both meets our expectations and exceeds our dreams.
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go and find a Sudohbucks mug.",9
"
                It's good but not great. Here's the reason why. I have just watched episode 24, kokuhaku. I am beginning to think this anime has some pacing problems. Why did the producer increase the pace so much in just 4 or 5 episodes? Seriously, in one episode, the two main characters went from casual friends to essentially engaged. I think that the producer wanted to emphasize character development more in the first half, but the anime is far too rushed from ep 20 to 24. If they went at the speed of the first 19 episodes, I would expect that there would be a second season
                  to resolve things. But, the producer hurried and essentially cut off the plot. 
Nontheless, great storyline, nice cast, great seiyus, they managed to turn the stereotyped shonen romance into something with more drama and less fanservice. If the plot was spread over two seasons, maybe it would have been even better. Probably the best shonen romance in the last few years. This is one reason why I like light novel adaptations over visual novel and manga adaptations, there's more dramatic effects that the producers can take liberty with.",9
"
                I am one to adore romantic comedies as they are more than awesome, and Toradora is another one to add to my collection of absolute favourites. If you are a new watcher to anime, or even browsing looking for a new Rom Com to watch, I strongly suggest Toradora. Im going to briefly touch on a few things about the series.
Plot
- Without trying spoiling anything, I just want to say that the writers did a splendid job of working on the concept of ""high school love"" and how strange it can be. I like how every episode differs from each other, not a whole bunch
                  of repetition besides background plot which evolves into the main story plot. I love how easy this plot line is to follow compared to alot of different animes, where its complex. Toradora is an easy down to earth loving anime with tons of adventures!
Characters
 - The main characters are more than awesome, as none of them are boring. You have your cliche characters, but thats okay, simplistic is good at times. The thing I think I love most about all the characters is that all of them are goofy, crazy and awesome. Taiga is a mean butt head but a lovely angel at the same time! AWESOME! While Minori is a down to earth lover, gentle and soft! I better stop before I ruin the series! 
Personal thoughts
 - Toradora is right now my favourite anime, as its easy to follow and belongs to be recognized for the down to earth, loving, carefree, awsome rom coms that belong in everyones heart. I could watch this series more than a thousand times! It has some of the same emotions like clannad, the good but sad emotions. The emotions are also happy and sweet when they need to be especially when people fall in love, especially HOW they fall in love. How they fall in love is so different from anything I have every experienced with real life or any anime, its just awesome. They just want each other to be happy but they are too blind to see it. I've yipped too much haha sorry about that :). Last comments, Torada=awesome!",9

                I don't know what it is about this anime, but it is one of the most enjoyable anime around. Nothing stands out in particular, but everything just clicks together.
Story: Well there really isn't that much of a story yet, we are still getting to know the characters, but the plot so far, without giving it away has been very exciting and funny in many parts.
Art: I love this style of drawing, especially the EYES. The pictures really create the atmosphere that enhance the series even more.
Sound: No comment, don't really know how.
Character: If you watch it, you will fall in love with the two protagonist
                  STRAIGHT AWAY
Enjoyment: Top of the class
Really watch it, watch it watch it.
N.B. By what I have written, you'd probably think it is some lighthearted anime that someone put together without much thought, but it is far from that, watching some of it again, this is a masterpiece put across to us in a way we can relate to (not abstract)",10

                This anime was one of the best animes what i have ever seen. Characters were very delightful and the grafic prefectly showed that this anime made 1 year ago ^^ Voce actors fitted perfectly to the characters as we thought from Kugimiya Rie :D 
For me it was rare that the guy got the 'cleaning maniac' and good at cooking role and the girl was the totally opposite to it :D Taiga and Ryuuji were in a great harmony they were funny and adorable. 
The story was very simple yet it's wonderful! A meeting of the school  grimmest stundents. I like the way how
                  Ryuuji handled Taiga's explosions :D 
Overall it's a great 10.",10

                God, where to even start with this show? It's one of the first anime that I ever watched (about 3yrs ago now) and was solely responsible for dispelling away my preconceptions about anime consisting solely of cute anime girls and annoying japanese OP songs. This show completely blew my mind and I'm saying that, as someone who isn't really a weeb and has never considered himself to be one (since I use to find parts of the culture a bit cringe). This show singlehandedly made me stop taking anime as a joke and actually start to look for good shows to watch. I know toradora
                  is controversial, lots of people say its overrated, others say its the best thing ever. For me, it was my first romcom, so it hit super hard.
Anyways, recently I was feeling a bit down, so I decided to rewatch it, something that I've never done with any show ever (non anime included). I tend to never rewatch/re-read/re-anything things because I've always seen it as a waste of time. Like, if you've seen something, why re-experience it? Just go watch something else instead, right? But I remembered Toradora to be so good the first time that I just had to rewatch. Aaaand, let's just say the rewatch hit just as hard as the first time. It's still got it. After finishing today, I realized that I never wrote a review for it, so here goes.
STORY
The reason why I love this show so much, is that it makes you feel so good, and yet so bad at the same time. It makes me depressed, and yet longing for more. 
There's something so pure about the story, because it is what constitutes a perfect, innocent life, and it's what most, if not all of us, dream of. 
We all long to be Ryuuji. We long to have a group of supportive friends, to go through life together with. I mean, life is scary man. It makes no sense, and often times we really have no clue what we're doing. A group of friends is quite literally the most important thing in a person's life, next to eating and drinking. Without other people to share it with, what REALLY is the point of life? We could all use a Kitamura to always have our back. A Ryuuji to cook for us, and listen when we need to rant. A Minorin, to sacrifice some of her own desires for our benefit. An Ami to see through our mask that no one else can see through, and push us to be our true selves. 
We want to get caught up in the silly love affairs and rumors of our friends and help setup love relationships in silly ways. We want to walk to school with them in the cold winter, steamy breaths in the air, and laugh about the silly things we did over break. We wish to go to each other's houses after a long boring day of school, to drink, laugh and share secrets. We want to have festive holiday parties, where we celebrate the growth of our high school class, whom we've gotten close to over the course of the year. And finally, we long to meet a girl, and not think of much of her at first. But over time, as we interact more and more, gradually fall for her. And eventually, build our life together with that girl, despite never having planned any of it.
But of course, real life isn't that way. High school isn't a paradise. People in classes aren't all friends with one another. A friend group doesn't just fall into your lap. If you are introverted, socially awkward or weird, you will have very few friends. Being Asian and really introverted, my high school experience was the polar opposite of Toradora. 
Imagine this: Most people don't even know your name, or know you exist. You have no friends. You came out of middle school with only a few people you could call ""friend"", most of whom you instantly lost contact with after the start of the year. You sit alone in class, and wish it weren't so, but are too shy to join in the conversations around you. At lunch, you sit with this other kid, alone at a table, and the two of you sometimes exchange a few words, because it makes both of you a little less lonely. Before classes, you hear the whispering of the normal kids around you. There's probably some spicy drama going on, but you've long since dismissed any chance at being a part of it. That's only reserved for normal people. And of course, there's no cute girl nicknamed the ""Palm Topped Tiger"" that you meet on the first day, and have a stare-off with in the hallways. Instead there's dudes vaping in the bathrooms.
Once the bell rings, you walk out into the already darkening winter sky. After a long, dull, lonely walk home, you have nothing to look forward to. Not knowing what else to do, you spend hours toiling away at some insignificant homework problem which you will forget in a few weeks, for some miniscule letter on a report card. All you hear is the quiet ambience of your room. You dream instead to hear a constant barrage of messages from your closest friends, who are inviting you out to dinner or catching you up on the latest shenanigans of your friend group. But of course, you remind yourself that you have no friends. 
After dinner, you mutter out the hundreth ""yes, dad"", as he asks you to clean up the dishes, and you do so, looking out the window into the dark sky, wishing instead that you lived next to a Taiga, who you could knock on the window pane of, who would make your life an adventure. But it's just that, a WISH. Instead, you bury all the pain in video games and any other cope you can find, because you are too scared and defeated to try and fix the problem. Repeat this routine for months and months, for years and years, and bam, you have my life.
See the contrast?
Toradora is so good, because for me it finally satisfies my imagination of what high school COULD'VE been like. It's like watching a dream, a life I never had, but wish dearly were real. And as I watch the show, my mind SUBCONSCIOUSLY puts myself in Ryuuji's shoes, and I get to pretend that for once, I am Ryuuji and have a close friend circle, a girl who loves me but is too shy to say it, and when she finally does, we will live our lives happily ever after to the day we die. And yet, once the episode ends, I am once again thrown back into the bleak, lonely dull of my own reality.
I get that I'm projecting a lot, and I also understand that most people's high school lives were not as depressing as mine. But this is the depressing aspect of Toradora, because it makes me realize just how utterly shit my high school life really was. It almost feels like a cruel joke, as you compare my real life to that of Ryuuji's. And as I watch, it almost feels like a mockery. Like ""yeah, this life exists and high schoolers actually live it, but you were just not lucky enough/chad enough to live it"". 
Funnily enough, the closest character to me would probably be the homeroom teacher. You know, the one who kept bringing up the fact that she was 30, and missed high school. She was seething because she wished to be young again, to have another chance. I definitely feel the same way.
SOB STORY
I'm 20 now, and about to graduate college. And I still get that nagging feeling that my best years are behind me. I get the feeling that I missed out on my chance to ever have a friend group. To create silly memories with. To experience teenage love. I still don't know how to cope with it. It genuinely hurts, and often times I try to keep myself busy to try not to think about it, but it doesn't always work. Watching shows like Toradora is like pulling the blister off the wound, that I worked so hard to patch. It's painful, and it genuinely makes me regret rewatching this.
I'm sad to report that it didn't get better. I still have very few friends, and have never come close to experiencing even a fraction of the excitement that happens in one Toradora episode, in my real life. You might say, ""well, rma2002, that's your decision, YOU must be doing something wrong in your life. Stop sitting on your ass and do something about it.""
Yeah, maybe. Perhaps it's the fact that I'm shy, have low self esteem, never stuck with a club in school, have no defining skills, am a minority in a majority white country so I find it hard to relate to lots of people, and hate myself more and more as the years go by, as my chance at ever making it slips more and more. I'm not saying it's not my fault, in fact, it very much is all my fault. But you're here for the review anyway so I won't get into the ""why"" too much. What I'm saying is, Toradora is the perfect suicide fuel, as you tease your love-starved mind with a life that you wish you had, but never could attain. Perhaps in that way, it also is life-changing, in that it serves as more motivation for me, to finally get out of my rut and live my best life, despite being avoidant and scared of being rejected. I'm still young, I still have time. Maybe my own Ryuuji, my own Kitamura, my own Minorin, Taiga, and Ami exist out there. I just need to go and find them.
And I get it, Toradora is coked up. You could say, ""rma2002, obviously this show is meant to be exaggerated. You're reading into it too much. Girls like Taiga, Minorin and Ami don't exist in real life"". Perhaps. I wouldn't know, to be honest. I've never had that many friends at once. But it makes me wonder, do some people in the world really live like this? Where everyday is an adventure, and no day is dull? Do some people really just go into everything blindfold, and come out with it all figured out? Or rather, they have such a strong friend group, that someone else in their group figures it out for them? Just like Taiga- doing what comes into her mind impulsively, without any thought, and having a Ryuuji to pick up after her? I would guess that sure, some people like this do exist, and boy I envy them, almost to the point of hatred. They don't know how good they have it. Because being alone in life is torture.
Ah shit, my inner incel is coming out again. Not now, dammit.
ROMANCE DONE RIGHT
Another aspect I love about Toradora, is that the romance is realistic and pure. Instead of shows which simply have some hot anime girl and all the show does is emphasize how kawaii or hot she is, while all the dudes drool over her. Like that ""harem"" genre- I never understood how people can willingly watch that stuff. Toradora has an actual storyline, a romance which is mostly believable. It's not some silly MC with zero personality, who has to choose between a bunch of girls. No, Ryuuji and Taiga grow as people in the show. You can tell Ryuuji genuinely cares for Taiga, and vice versa, although Taiga has a tough time showing it back. And also, the characters aren't drawn too poorly either :P
I guess this goes back to the point I made earlier again, which is, we wish we could meet our future partners like this. If you ask any guy (or girl), how do you want to meet your future partner, I'm pretty sure most of them would say something similar to, ""we start off as friends, and then over time I fall for them"". It's not, ""oh, I want them to be super hot and rich and pretty, and we have sex, and then we marry"". Like, you cannot build a relationship on looks alone. It doesn't matter how great the sex is, superficial relationships will fail. Just look at Ryuuji's dad and mom for that. They also pale in comparison to relationships that are rooted in something deeper. It's important to be attracted to your partner physically, but fundamentally, that's not the main focus of a romantic relationship. It's the emotional side that matters most. For Taiga and Ryuuji, it was personal struggles that brought them together. Taiga suffered with her family/being an all around klutz, and Ryuuji was there to help her through that due to his kind and loyal nature. Ryuuji struggled with his looks and confidence, and Taiga's loud and bold personality was able to cover him. They really made up for each other's problems perfectly.
Maybe this is my innocent, naïve mind talking (seeing as I've never been in a relationship), but I've always thought that having a girlfriend/boyfriend is just like having a really close friend, who happens to be of the other gender. And what do you do with friends? Well, you confide in them, talk to them, share your embarrassing struggles with them. Yet you also listen to, and support them. You both give, and you receive things from them, which is the beauty of it. Apart from the physical attraction, we long to be attracted to them emotionally as well, as they fill a part of us that was previously missing. That's why I think the romance in Toradora is so beautiful- Ryuuji and Taiga genuinely needed one another, and there's just something so perfect as they help one another with their matters, and eventually fall in love. It's like putting together the last puzzle piece in a big jigsaw- the rest of the pieces were already put in place, right under our noses. 
I think Toradora also showcases something really rare in today's world- a relationship that goes deeper than looks. In a society where online dating, pickup artists, onlyfans, and internet porn is so prevalent- in a culture where hookups and cheating are considered the norm, where breast size and dick size and height mean everything and personality means nothing, one can forget that true love can come from something more than just appearance. That you can actually care someone as a person FIRST, and in doing so, fall for them AFTER. That you can love someone as a person, before loving their genetics. That true love isn't dead. That, at least to me, is the best romance of all. 
So in summary, the writers focused heavily on the relationship side of romance, the human part, which is a side that barely any, if not a single other show (that I've seen anyways) is able to cover accurately. 
CRITICISM
Personally, my only qualm with the show is that Ryuuji probably had too little character to him. Feels like he was a bit too much of a stale character, like we still don't know much about his family (his dad?), also a person like him just seems to artificial (like seriously, this guy is a master chef and loves to clean apartments as a hobby? I don't buy it.) I mean, I understand why Taiga is emphasized more as a character- the majority of anime watchers (romcoms at least) are (surprise surprise) men, so obviously spending more time polishing the girls is probably gonna bring in more money. 
 Also, the story ""claimed"" that he liked Minorin but in reality, it seemed like he didn't really care much for her. He was just a bit too indifferent about Minorin for me to think that he liked her (compare this to Taiga everytime ""ki-ki-kitamura kun"" as much as breathed in her direction!) 
END
Anyways, I'm tired of typing. Thanks for reading, and watch this show if you feel like being depressed for a month or longer. 
edit: actually fml why did i rewatch this? i forgot how fkin depressing it is. please god help what do i do now ffs",10

                Following is a review on Toradora. 
So, Toradora is arguably the most popular SoL Highschool Anime out there and for God knows whatever reasons. Alright for starters this show isn't even good. And it's so Goddamn overrated it makes my head hurt. 
The art is pretty meh and generic. Yeah yeah the Anime is a decade old but that's no excuse since Haruhi Suzumiya had a much better art despite being a 2006 Anime. 
Now onto the characters
Aisaka Taiga: OK, now from where do I begin. For starters she IS NOT a good character. She is the living breathing example of why the ""Tsundere"" type
                  is cancer. 
Her character is so bad yet people act like she is some sort of Goddess. Her obsessions with that bland ass Kitamura was so cringe worthy to watch that it hurts. Her aggressive behavior was uncalled for for the most part but that is EXACTLY the reason the creatures who are even lower than degenerates love her. She was over-dramtic as hell. And her character BARELY developed till the end but the part of the reason would be that it was so bad to begin with that you couldn't do anything about it. 
Ryuuji: Ah the typical and generic dense af Main protagonist with little to no self-respect in him. A girl constantly insults him yet he is all about ""Taiga this, Taiga that"". Bullshit. 
Kuushieda: First of all her original Japanese voice is such a cringe it makes Asta's VA sound like Miyano Mamoru. Her character was all about ""I am Taiga's best friend and I'll even go and strangle some babies for her sorry sake"". Barely a likable character. 
Kitamura: Just watched the episode where this DUMB F*ck dyed his hair. That's all. It's enough for anyone to judge this dumbass. But for some reason girls are attracted towards him.
Kawashima Ami: Ah the only good part about the show. A character which actually developed and had a brain and was not only emotions. If it wasn't for her then I wouldn't be able to finish this hot garbage. I will nevr forgive the author for making her a love bird for a dumbass like Ryuuji who TILL THE END didn't even realize her feelings. 
Ok now the story. 
Typical Highschool story with over-dramatic situations. Now don't even think of giving me that ""They're only Highschool students"" bullshit because I went to school too and never once I was this dramatic and nor were my classmates were but hey at least the Over-dramatic moments in Toradora weren't nearly as Bad as in ""Oregairu"" (I'll write a review on that overhyped show too sometime later). Taiga is in love with Kitamura since she herself rejected him once. Her reaction whenever Kitamura arrives was not one bit cute. Ryuuji is your typical Main guy having problem interacting with people and everyone is scared of him because of his looks but still somehow have the most famous and most pretty looking girl in the class fall for him but that dumb F*ck still choose a flat, 4 cm short loli who is head over heels for another guy. But hey that's not all he is also in love with Kuushieda but somehow is afraid to show his feelings and that thing dragged out until it was revealed that Kuushieda also have feelings for Ryuuji but won't admit it instead sacrificed it for Taiga who is obviously head over heels for Kitamura but somehow have developed feelings for Ryuuji too (what a hoe). Mehhh. Also I would also like to mention the student council president. First of all she has no manners. She doesn't even know how to talk. Giving every student insulting remarks and every degenerate just laughed at it. If I were in those students I would probably start a protest against that sort of a President. Taiga kicking her butt was the only time I ever liked Taiga. Also about the ending. Honestly I liked it. BUT somehow the fanbase consist of brainless sheeps complained about that. Idiots, can't you all see that this was the only time when Taiga's character showed any development. She finally realized everything and returned to her mother. 
All in all this Anime is barley enjoyable and overrated as hell. I feel like people like this show just for the sake of bragging about it only. Definitely one of my least favourite Anime of all times. The official Neon Genesis Evangelion of Highschool SoL genre.
I don't get the hype for this trash bag at fucking all",4
"
                I loved the first episode, was disappointed by the rest.
The characters are very good, my expectation was probably too high, but they botched the whole ending. I watched it until the end, with the hope that it would be at least half as funny as the beginning, and was disappointed by the excessive drama.
I didn't really mind the story, but that's secondary, I think in this kind of anime the single characters are much more important than the plot.
Taiga is a great character, no doubt. And Ryuji is also very good most of the time.
But after reading the manga, I finally understood the whole development,
                  and how much of the anime is wrong.
Some examples:
- In the manga Kitamura is listening to Taiga's spontaneous confession (that she is in love with him, but in some way she also likes Ryuji) while Ryuji is in the restroom, to make sure that nobody else is listening. In the anime Kitamura tricks Taiga into saying what she feels about Ryuji while Ryuji is stalking her. 
- Ami is forcing (if not begging) Taiga to say ""Ryuji is mine"", and she succeeds. This part is completely missing in the anime. Ami is trying to bring Taiga out of her comfort zone and start to accept her feelings, while in the anime it seems that she is only teasing her.
- After the swimming contest, Ryuj is already aware that he likes Taiga.
- When Taiga comes back from hospital, Ryuji is almost confessing to her, but she stops him, probably because she doesn't want to hurt Minori.
What I mean: in the manga (and in the novel probably) their relationship is progressing slowly but steadily and naturally, while in the anime there are some emotional peaks without an explanation. In the last episodes Ryuji seems to switch off his crush for Minori all of a sudden, which really bothered me. There was no signal until that point, the only progress was on Taiga's side. This is too abrupt for me.",1
"
                ""Its a high school romance, but rather non-typical even if it seems like it at first.
Very enjoyable. Very touching.""
Thats what I've told some friends, so that might as well do here.
I don't really like review because I feel like I need to convince others why I think its as good as I think it is. But, I don't really need to, do I? If its good enough for me, who cares what anyone else says? Unless they agree of course!
Anyway, love it. Up there with Clannad in my book even if they really aren't very similar. Just both highly enjoyable to comparable degrees.

"
                I wrote a review for this beofre and this is my second one but after re-watching Toraodra recently I have re- made it with slightly different opinions and even better in sight of the show. Here i go:
*Contains Spoilers* *Contains Spoilers*
 What seems like a typical high school romantic comedy that has seemingly been done countless times, Toradora shines and becomes something special. But what’s special is not the story itself, but in fact the characters which really makes this anime one of a kind. 
Toradora has a pretty typical feel for a romantic comedy  story about love and high school, but the way
                  it is executed is anything but typical. The male protagonist, Ryuuji, is in love with a very weird girl named Minori and it just so happens that he is in the same class as her, along with his best friend Kitamura.  Also in the class in the female protagonist, Taiga Aisaka who is a pretty vicious girl with an aggressive attitude that everyone is afraid off; aside from Minori who Taiga’s best friend . Taiga and Ryuuji , through a number of strange and accidental encounters end up coming to an agreement o help one another gain the love of each other’s best friend. This begins a very funny master and dog relationship between to the two protagonists as for some reason Ryuuji just goes along with all of Taiga’s whims. The events that transpire afterwards are simply hilarious as they fail so many times due to enormous flaws in their plans or simply flaws in themselves. Ryuuji actually ends up taking care of Taiga who he sees is rather clumsy girl when it comes to taking care of herself. This story is great and will make you laugh and cry (in the end particularly) at the same time; all while learning essential things about life and love, such as the value of family and being there for the people you care about. The story here is very heartfelt and is very well executed despite the fast pacing in the final episodes. Also there were not too many predictable moments in Toradora aside from the very beginning of the show. Most people wouldn't even be able to tell who ends up with whom just from watching the first few episodes. For me, it deserves a nice 9/10.
The art work in this anime is actually pretty well. The collage of colors and just everything in general is nice. The characters look well and uniquely drawn as well to fit their persona and what they represent. Also just think Taiga is extremely cute, one of the cutest characters ever actually! I give it really good 9/10
Toradora has two opening and two ending songs which both portray different things. As the story shifts in direction and the characters begin to have a change in heart the second opening and ending begin. The first set of theme songs are nice but the second set are really really good; particularly the ending. It fits the story perfectly and is a really great song. I love watching it after each episode as it always makes me smile. Also the OST tracks are great as well. There are a number of good one’s but Lost My Pieces is absolutely the best. The emotions evoked by it is very deep and makes the scenes that much more heartfelt. It almost melts my heart away. Sound definitely is 10/10.
The characters are what really put the show over the top. There is simply not one character in this show that I do not like! I might even be able to go out and say that I love almost all the characters, especially the main characters of course. They are all so unique and there is so much depth to each one. Ryuuji is probably one of gentlest, most caring, nicest guys ever. It’s funny because almost no one knows that since they all are too afraid to approach him because well he just looks like he would beat your ass haha. We find out about Ryuuji’s past and how he takes care of his single mother by being the house wife and while she works at night. Ryuuji’s character is generally typical, but has qualities that make him unique like his cleaning disorder which is quite funny at times. Also, the way he goes out of his way for Taiga on so many occasions and constantly is there for her is amazing. Ryuuji is an amazing guy and a damn good character.
Taiga Aisaka. There is just so much to say about Taiga that I could go on for days. She is my favorite character on this show and favorite of all time! The way she changes throughout the anime is spectacular. Despite her rough and aggressive personality, she is actually a sweetheart and is just a clumsy girl who wishes to be loved.  She is very passionate and constantly tries her best at everything she puts effort to do. She is also a prototypical tsundere character so she may come off as arrogant and mean sometimes but that is just a front for her genuine warm side.
There are 3 lesser main characters who are equally good and create an amazing main cast. Minori may be crazy and energetic as hell, but at times we see her vulnerable and passionate side. She even drops a few quotes of knowledge that speaks volumes to her depth as a character. Ami is probably my second favorite character in this show. Initially she is puts on the façade of a cute, air head to get everyone to like her and almost everyone falls for it immediately; that is except for Taiga. Ami comes out of her shell later on and becomes a strong person and a heavy contributor toward the main story at hand. She is very sharp and is able to point out and see things that many others don’t.
Kitamura is a very complex guy to say the least. He is very intelligent but an idiot when it comes to certain things. He seems like he has control over what he is doing but at many times displays that he too in fact does not know what he is doing. He is a really nice guy which is the reason he gains Taiga's affection and many other girls which he has no clue of! It doesn't matter though but you’ll see why though as the story progresses. For Characters, this gets an easy 10/10.
I’ve watched Toradora several times now and I must say that even after watching it over, I still laugh my ass off and am moved as if I’ve never seen each scene before. I know it is coming and yet I still have the same reaction each time. And when I finish it each time, I still find myself wanting it not to end and just wanting more and more. I can be watching an episode and before I even realize it, a whole 20 minutes has passed by and now it’s over. The felling is unmatched. This makes me laugh as well as tear up, and even makes me pause the show to catch my breath from the intensity at some points  Enjoyment for this anime can be nothing less than 10/10.
Toradora is a great anime as it is simply one of the most complete and enjoyable animes out there. Everyone can watch this show and be happy and love it unless you do not like tsundere characters or dislike romance. I especially recommend this to anyone who loves romantic comedies as this is the best one or two you’ll ever find. Toradora may not be the best anime ever but it certainly deserves a perfect score as it more than achieved its purpose and that’s all anyone should ask for. Watch Toradora, I promise you won’t regret it. 9.6/10 or 10/10",10

                *review starts with my honest opinion for people who don't want to waste their time. Don't forget to read the overall opinion too. No spoilers so far as I over-read my review. Enjoy, and sorry if any mistakes are visible!*
You know, when I first finished my first anime, I was really into searching for something similar. I bet everybody's first anime was their masterpiece and formed their actual concept of what anime they prefer and strive for to watch. My first anime was called 'Blade and Soul', due to the fact I'm quite a senior player in that game, and was really excited about the
                  anime. I really liked it, and I still tell the same, however, the anime itself wasn't what actually is important. The important fact is that afterwards I found out about SnS, which literally formed my total perception of what I like. It was my masterpiece and actually managed to force me to think about my future. But eventually you get used to that 'what am I gonna do' feeling, and continued watching different anime, knowing that all of them have some kind of story to them, that is why I made a huge list for myself. Now you may ask, why am I telling all this? If you noticed, I like action, fantasy, super natural anime, romance is a plus, and you yourself, reading this review, might be someone like me, thinking 'Should I really watch this? I'm not really into this kind of anime, so I'd rather watch something else, because it's probably not interesting'. That's what I thought when I first added it to my list. One day I stumbled across a video that spoiled me the last scene of the anime. It fired me up. The next day I picked up this anime and watched it in a single watch. Now I'm here, writing this review right after this. If you want my honest opinion, pick the show already, it's just going to be a conclusion of the key points to put a rating onto this anime.
STORY - 9.
Indeed, I will admit some people might disagree, since many really loved the story, and I did myself too. Everything was completely fine, and it really messed with my feelings at times. I loved the way the creators developed the story without any plot holes and without any rushing in a 25 episode life-span. When I finished my 13th episode of this, I thought 'Will this even fit into 25 episodes?', because that episode was a little twisting everything for me. However, it was nothing to worry about, since they managed to execute everything just as I expected. No, the anime is not predictable, if you really want to know - it's the other way around, very unpredictable, because it manages to force you into believing everything is actually going the way they're telling you. But the hints are obvious, and I'll tell you a cheat - always hear out stupid c-, I mean, Ami-san. I'm not telling when, just pay attention, and you'll understand me. She is quite a mature and smart person, even though she is quite a meanie.
The only minus in the story that I managed to spot - it wasn't rushed, instead it was the opposite - it was too slow. However, it was probably due to the fact I was spoiled from the start, nonetheless, I forgot it until I got to the last episodes. The last episodes messes with feelings, make sure to get ready. And actually it's quite reasonable - it doesn't put you into the seriousness, and instead of focusing on the main plot, it inserts comedy and a little of side-stories, and the main plot only starts off later, with twists happening later.
ART - 9.
The art and animations were totally fine, however, the climax of the arts' beauty can be noticed the best at winter's period in the anime, and that happens only in the latter episodes of it. Nonetheless, the anime is really well looking considering today's standards, to be honest, I didn't notice anything bad about the art style nor the art itself, the only thing I noticed is the intros/opening being a little worse quality than the anime itself, but probably it's just me. I only watch them once - when I first see it, and if there's a new one - once again to see the new one. That happened in the 13th episode I believe. However, the last episode surprised me the most, that it had a 8 minutes introduction before the opening.
SOUND - 10.
As I mentioned before in one of my reviews, I'm not the one to judge this. However, I actually managed to run into a discussion with myself about Inko-chan's voice. I got interested who actually voiced that thing. 
I-I-I-......Inpo.
*spoiler starts*
he eventually tells his name
*spoiler ends*
Jokes aside, voice acting was great. However, at times I missed Takasu's speech, as of him responding 'Y-Yeah' and such, but I guess it's to expect, I doubt I would be able to talk anything different in situations as he had to go through. All voices were really nice, however, I really liked Yasuko's voice. Just my honest opinion here! 
CHARACTER - 10.
I bet this is the most important topic in this anime, because the characters develop a lot throughout the anime! Considering they eventually reach their age of 18, as we could assume. In the start of the anime, everything is okey-dokey, a guy meeting a girl, they both find out about their crushes, and decide to help each other, even though Takasu is kinda looked low upon Taiga. 
However, the development in this anime is visible in many of the characters, that's why I really enjoyed the show. The whole class, and even some outsiders, managed to have development in their character. I'm talking about Sakura, Sumire, Nanako and others, not even mentioning the development between the main characters! 
ENJOYMENT - 10.
It was really mind-blowing to see something complicated as the situation in the anime, unravel into something that I would just be completely satisfied with! And writing this review just makes me feel happy about the fact that I really enjoyed the show. To me, watching anime, is like... is like watching something, that probably will never happen to me, such misfortune (pun)... and seeing a happy end makes me happy... makes me happy, that maybe one day I will have a happy ending myself, no matter what kind of future awaits me, we all have our destined paths and we all will have our own rendezvous loves and passions. I was really excited while watching this anime, and it made me realize some things that even though I thought I realized before, throughout life, we make many realizations, don't we? 
OVERALL - I will conclude everything with one, simple quote from Alan Watts (overheard it on a chill mix somehow, and couldn't bear the fact I didn't know it! Coincidences like that happen, don't they? And here I'm putting it on one of my favorite, if not the favorite, anime review!)
When we finally got down to something, 
which the individual says he really wants to do, 
I will say to him:
You do that and forget the money, 
because, if you say that getting the money is the most important thing, 
you will spend your life completely wasting your time. 
You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living, 
that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing, 
which is stupid. 
Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way.
What I mean is that, instead of clinging onto things that you THINK would be the best, instead, look for something that would make you happy, and sometimes, the happiness is way closer than you think it is.",10

                ""Since ancient times, the dragon has been the only beast to equal a tiger."" - Ryuuji Takasu.
When I heard about this anime, Toradora!, I immediately put it on my Plan to watch list. I really love Romcom anime like Maid-sama. So was very glad when I when I finally got a chance to watch this.
About-
Toradora! is about a small high school girl and a normal, scary looking high school boy that bump into each other one day. On accident, the small girl, Taiga Aisaka, gives a love letter to the wrong guy, Ryuuji Takasu. After finding out who Taiga likes, Ryuuji tells her who he
                  likes in exchange. After that, they start helping each other get together with the people they like.
Things you should know-
- Taiga's past reflexes on her personally.
- The ending was a.... Lets just say I had tears in my eyes.
Overall- 
I love this kind of anime, and I want to watch it again. 
Recommended-
I recommend this anime to people who love Romcom anime. 
Not recommended for people who don't get the humor in Slapstick anime, or comedy based on violence.",10
"
                I'm a Japanese, so please excuse my poor English writing.
The heroine is Taiga. She is selfish at a glance, but in fact she is good person. Above all, she is very cute! 
The main character(Ryuuji) is male and I'm not fascinated by male character of anime in most cases, but I like him very much because he has something like motherhood in spite of his intimidating looks. He is very good at cleaning and cooking, and likes doing them. He is very gentle. You will find his many charms through watching ""Toradora!"",  as I did. At first, He is not aware of affection for
                  Taiga, but his all casual behavor is full of love and tenderness for Taiga from first to last. That's great. 
I had never been a fan of love comedy, because I've never experienced the love and I can't understand those situantion. However, ""Toradora"" is an exception. After watching this anime, I want to be in love now. 
You shoud watch ""Toradora"", if you haven't made up your mind whether you watch this or not.",9
"
                After searching internet for a while for an anime to watch, I finally found Toradora. I heard people saying it's really good, so I decided to give it a try. Just 10 mins into the first episode, I was already addicted to it.
 The story is really good. Everything in the scene is so interesting that it really gets my attention. There are comedy, romance, and high school life that combined together creates a fantastic flavor. That's no minute in this anime that I'm bored of. Not only that, but also from an episode to another, taking a break is almost not an option. It's
                  this good. 
The art is absolutely well done. The environments are nice, and the characters are cute. It gives me enough details that makes me wanna watch it, and just focus on the screen. 
The sound is outstanding. The voice is nice, and really enjoyable to listen. The music when there is something going on is nicely done as well. It really provides a nice experience.
The character is individually unique. Characters have difference interesting characteristic which gives a lot of varieties. And each of the character's personality really gets my attention to understand what they actually are.
Overall, this is really an enjoyable romance/comedy/highschool anime. Each of its components, art, sound, story, character, and more, makes Toradora an interesting anime to watch.",10
"
                THE VOID!!!!!
At the time I finished this show, I had the biggest void of my anime watching life. That void lasted for a good week, and that is, truly, a great thing. It's great because the only times I feel a void is when I finish a truly fantastic series.
What's wrong with this show? Hell if I know, this is in my top 5 favorite shows, from episode 1 to the very end I couldn't stop watching. I think I woke up one day, decided to watch something new, and I finished this whole show in one day.
The art is simple, but the character designs
                  are a perfect match, along with a great... GREAT soundtrack.
I love these characters from the fun loving cheerful love interest to the rude, yet charming super model, each character is developed and each is a true joy to watch. Yes, it's a romance, but it's a slice of life before anything, choosing to save the romance for later
This show is truly a masterpiece and I give it a 10/10",10
"
                A very cute romcom anime on the first half then inclines to the drama side by the end of the series. This anime had a likable characters and their interaction together were very adorable. Throughout the series the characters deal with insecurity and weaknesses that they have. You'd feel emotionally invested regarding the characters and their personality. 
It did obviously have its fair share of shortcomings; the series was predictable and the plot was fairly generic, it also have these tendencies to be slow at times especially on latter half but mostly was overshadowed by the good bits. One of the best romcom/drama anime out
                  there.",9
"
                Overall	
Yet another high school love-triangle. Wait, make that a pentagon... It's pretty cute, pretty funny, pretty heartwarming and pretty believable. Note the ""pretty"", not ""very"". 
I had a good time watching it, but I think there were a couple of let-downs, much because of some events being based on very illogical and non-understandable behaviour.
Animation	
The characters are well designed and the animation is vivid. But the guy that designed that parrot should get fired!
Sound	
The opening/ending songs were not really anything to write home about and the background music wasn't really noticable (I guess this isn't just a bad thing, though. It's called background music for a
                  reason). 
The high sound score is mainly because of the voice acting. It really gave life to the characters. This does not apply for the parrot, though.
Story	
Girl and boy decide to help each other confessing to their loved ones. Most of the show, it's pretty unclear and interesting regarding who is gonna end up with who. In the meantime, school life goes on as usual with many side characters, which adds credibility. The episodes keep a steady intensity which keeps your attention.
The few last episodes are sub par, sadly. The tempo goes down and the characters start to act wierd. 
There is also a short episode called ""SOS"". It doesn't contain any spoilers and can be watched at any time during the show. Just don't expect anything of it, it's a superdeformed little comedy that is not funny or good in any way.
Character	
The characters are well thought out and are all of different personalities. Still, them being together feels credible. Interesting characters are a must in a love story, and I think Toradora succeeds here.",8
"
                So, in short this is a AWSOME anime. With no doubts my all time favorite in this category. WHY?WHY? because it has everything to be sucessful. Good story, good art, awsome music (OP and END are so goooood), the characters have all differents personalities and have all good reasons to love them. A thing that i loved very much in this anime is the construction of the bound between the characters. In romance anime there are often only one or two moments (not very original one) that can be considerate emotional moments. But inthis one, HOLY shit there is a lot of them. And they
                  are very great moment that bring tears to my eyes. I recommend this anime to everyone that like this kind of stuff and even if someone that is new to roamance go with this one, you're not gonna regret it.",10
"
                One of the first anime that I have ever seen. Lets go back to 2012, when I was in 8th grade and I'm just starting to watch some anime. I watched Death Note and FMA: Brotherhood, and than I watched this. I had no clue what to expect, since it was the first time I had seen a RomCom/Slice of Life anime. I watched the first couple of episodes and I was very interested in it. As the series gets closer to the end, it gradually gets better and better. As I finished the series (only took 2 days since I was so hooked), I
                  realized how amazing this series was. Not only was it the funniest RomCom I've ever seen to this date, but it really changed my life and my morals. I used to be kind of a dick before I watched anime and now I was all about helping others, ALL BECAUSE of this show. The ending really made me feel like there should have a 2nd season. It really got me into Slice of Life/Romance genre. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.",9
"
                It's been difficult to find any more anime series' this good, this is by far my favourite release. I don't usually watch an anime show through it's opening and endings, but for this series, I've watched through every single OPs and ED, its JUST THAT GOOD! 
The story is a bit slow to start up at first, but it also builds up every main character in that period of time, showing the watcher all those quirky personalities :D. Once you start watching, you can't put it down. 
The Art design team should be proud of their achievement, the graphics are smooth and slick, which isn't
                  usually found on every anime series. I've only seen those good graphics in recent releases such as SAO, and most other recent shows don't even have graphics up to Toradora standards. 
I've found this anime series the most enjoyable of all the releases I've ever seen. There are dramatic, tear-jerking scenes to those that will have you rolling all over you're carpet laughing.
The ending is fairly obvious, but hey, it's the journey that counts, right?",10
"
                There are some spoiler passage but they are between (Spoiler).....(Spoiler) so don't worry :)
This is my first anime review. Why because Toradora! made me share my opinion to everyone.
For the ones without willing to read everything, I shall say: Toradora! its on my LovCom top.
Story 9/10: Why 9/10, because the website were I watched it, it didn't translated the note left by Taiga, so it was a big hole on the story, but still, for me, it was a bit hard to understand the almost ending (Spoiler), the good thing for the ones that didn't understand the ending it was when she came back (Spoiler.
                  Well the story was really good. Of course everyone knew that they would be together in the end, but still knowing that there was moments and confessions that made me love this anime. The story between everyone was really good, not even a single moment of cliche. I should say, the story is totally worth.
Art 10/10: The art was one of the best ones I saw. Really loved the way, and originality of the characters.
Music 9/10: Always right on time to hit the feelings.
Character 10/10: What can I say, every single one has a story, small or big, they have one. There is not a random character, every single one comes with an objective. This is a true love story between many characters.
Enjoyment 10/10: Well, I am a fan of romance, but when it comes whit a mix of comedy...f*ck yes, comedy makes a love story much better. I loved the way that this romance wasn't only about Taiga and Ryuji. I was totally surprised when (Spoiler) I discovered Kushieda Minori was in love whit Ryuji (Spoiler).
Overall 9/10
-------
Don't hate me if I only gave 9/10.
Why did I gave a 9/10, well the ending...(Spoiler) if when taiga left was explained a bit better,(Spoiler) I would give the anime 10/10, because for me the ending the most important thing on an Anime. Don't love faith on watching Toradora! its totally worth to watch the Anime, if you didn't understand the Finale, go to google and search for an explanation, like I did, and you will understand the Tainga objective.
--> Don't forget to watch the Ep. 25 until the end, even after the credits. Many people didn't gave the right score because they didn't watch the whole episode.
So if you want my opinion, if you should watch this? Well, yes, make it a ""plan to watch"" or a ""watch right now"" because:
1º if you love Comedy this is a ""need to watch"";
2º if you like comedy, this has some too, but don't forget this is a romance;
3º if you don't like romance, I shall say to you guys, I think you will start loving romance story's whit this one :D
4º just watch it xD
Thanks to those who read it until the end, Happy new year to everyone. Don't forget to press ""Helpfully"" or not.

"
                Story 9/10 Toradora starts as a simple romance comedy. Two teenagers, Taiga and Ryugi, have a crush on the others' friend, so they work together to try and set each other up with the other's friend. The part that makes Toradora a good anime is that soon the relationships start to change. Toradora challenges the idea that you always know how you feel about someone, and that love and friendship are straightforward things. The other thing that separates this from most romance comedies, is that while the ending is pretty obvious, the plot twists are amazing and send you off course, in a way that
                  just when you thought you saw a plot twist coming, another one sends you back into the abyss.
Art 9/10 The art style is very well done. When a character shows emotion, the subtle changes in the facial expressions put layers of depth to what the character is feeling and thinking. It is clear that the art is well taken care of, and that everything is taken into consideration.
Sound 8/10 The BG is nothing to die for, and won't likely be remembered, but it is good enough to do it's job, and supports the plot and theme well. The openings and endings (two of each) are very catchy and relevant to the story. The best part of the sound is the voices. Every actor perfectly portrays the personality of the character and how they are reacting to their surroundings, making even the smallest points in the plot have meaning.
Character 10/10 The characters in Toradora are easily the best, most well-developed characters in any anime I've watched. While the basic trait of a character is obvious and generic, the little details underneath are what define the characters so well, and also supplies so much of the plot. For example, Minorin is Taiga's best friend, and Ryugi's love interest. On the outside, she is fun, energetic, and almost crazy, and supplies most of the humor, An easy to recognize stereo-type in most animes. But, on the inside, she shows a very deep and emotional side, and can usually tell someones true personality just by looking at them.
Enjoyment 9/10 If you are a romance fan, I would recommend this heartily, and suggest it over almost anything else in it's genre. If you aren't much of a romance fan, I would still suggest you take a look at it and at least watch the first 7 episodes.",9
"
                So Toradora. A romantic love comedy with the tsundere queen herself, Taiga Aisaka. Man this anime was good and this had a great message to it. Anyways let us just get into the review.
Story:
The story was told fantastically. All the main characters have their own arcs and each of them mean something. This anime tells its story fluently and consistently. This anime had its funny scenes, but some of these scenes are actually very important to the story. The way some of the arcs explain what is happening to all the main characters relationships really makes this anime very good. This anime follows mostly Ryuji
                  throughout this anime and you will have 4 other main characters. The story I think was very well explained and executed.
Score: 10/10
Art
The art is good and the character designs are very well made also. The way they make Ryuji look so intimidating was very good and the expressions of all the characters. The lighting was average like most animes, but what really pops out is their movement and how fluent it is.
Score: 10/10
Sound
The soundtrack was fantastic and the OPs and the EDs were all good. Especially the OP, that is candy to my ears and I can't help, but sing. That is my personal preference though. Still the soundtrack is very good. The sound is also very good. The voice acting is also great. All the characters had the voices I expected. None of these characters had bad voice acting and that's a big plus.
Score: 10/10
Character
This is the anime's strongest aspect. The main characters are lovable and play a big role in some part of the anime. The supporting characters are also good. This anime also brought good character development and really all these characters are good. I personally liked all the characters except for one, but I can't spoil anything since this is a review.
Score: 10/10
Enjoyment
I swear this anime gave me a new view of what love really is. This anime is a romantic comedy and it indeed is a good anime. I loved almost all the characters and just loved the music played in the anime. The message that was sent though really gave me a new view of what love really is. At first, I thought love was all about finding your soulmate or love is like a fairy tale. That is what I was told growing up, but actually, love is something you might be confused by. Love is a confusing, weird, complex feeling that I don't think science can solve. Maybe the love of your life was right next to you all along. Maybe, you've found it already, you just haven't known. Love is wonderful considering how anything can happen in it. This anime understands love and it really knows how to portray it in this anime. That is really why I enjoyed this anime.
Score: 10/10
Overall
This anime is a great anime and I really would recommend anyone to watch this, even if they aren't a fan of the romance genre. This is actually a really mature romantic anime considering it knows what love really is. This receives a 10/10 due to how they told the story, how good the art was, how the songs and sounds were fantastic and how lovable most of the characters are. To me, this anime is what love really is and how you deal with love. And this got serious, now time to break the ice. 
Boku no Pico!
Mission accomplished.
Anyways this is it for the review and I hoped this has helped you to decide whether or not you will watch this or not and if you enjoy it.
Score: 10/10",10
"
                That dreary boredom that comes between good and original shows can only be broken be finding hidden treasures from seasons past. Gone are the carefree days when I could spot a winner just from the title art or even the synopsis. I have to actually read reviews now. Little did I expect that a subtle review would point my interest to a show that I had already overlooked several times.
Toradora! starts out like any of the other crappy billion slice-of-life high school love stories involving an over the top tsundere and a clueless male lead. There's a subtle twist at the beginning in that the
                  two main characters are actually helping one another to pursue outside love interests.
Of course you don't have to be psychically talented to figure out how things end up, but what may surprise you in this case is that the writers here went seven levels beyond 'nailing it' in terms of the story and the execution of the character arcs. This is the kind of show that makes me love Anime (and hate American television).
The characters that seem one-dimensionally shallow at the beginning of the show end up begin developed to the point of exposing hidden depths that reflect those true, painful and beautiful truths about human beings that you simply cannot find in western media. The significant characters in the show start out looking like silly (cartoonish?) parodies of a human beings but by the end of the series they've each been been exposed as a walking train-wreck of broken relationships and shattered emotions. As they struggle to put the pieces back together the beauty of life and the true nature of love shines out from the cracks.
If you can appreciate a love story or even any story with depth then Toradora! is a sleeping gem that will most certainly be worth your time. Give it a chance and watch a few episodes before you make your decision. It does drag on a little in places, but the story is very comfortable and there's always several things to keep watching for. If you can make it to the end without a soft smile and a twinge in your heart then you're either a robot or else you just watched a different show.",8
"
                I'm not sure how helpful this review will be, I'll just say that upfront. 
Toradora! is funny, emotional and kind-hearted all at the same time. I would recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys the genre and anyone who doesn't. The characters are relatable, likable, complex and dynamic. This show thrives on the characters but the story keeps it all together.
The story is something that can often ruin an anime but Toradora! keeps everything aligned and interesting for all 25 episodes. There is enough spontaneity to keep you guessing and enough predictable to not through you off or create plot holes  
All in all,
                  Toradora! gives you the certain vibe and feeling that is almost indescribable. You get so wrapped up in the story and the characters you feel a better empty after it is over. Fortunately, it's re-watch value is EXTREMELY high.",10
"
                I really dislike Taiga. 
I realise that this is a common trope in anime, but I really dislike how rude she is to Ryuuji. Not to mention the fact that their dynamic is really odd. She clearly has a father complex, and their relationship is pretty weird. I could not root for that relationship at all. 
The reason I find it weird too is probably because she looks, talks, and acts like she's 5 years old. I really don't understand how this anime can have such high ratings with a character like Taiga. No joke I was hoping they'd kill her off or something. 
Aside from that, in terms of the plot its decent. Especially towards the end, I didn't expect things to turn out the way they did.",3
"
                I have never written a review for an anime before but after watching Toradora! I had to sit down and give it a shot. I am not exactly experienced in watching the romance genre so I can't speak much to how it compares to others, but as far as anime in general goes this one is my favorite.
-Story- -9/10-
The show starts off relatively slowly but it does a good job of introducing the characters and the setting of the show, and sets the stage quite well for what follows. The plot can be predictable at times(particularly the first third or so of the show), but
                  there are also plenty of unexpected twists and turns that keep things from ever getting stale. I would say the best aspect of the plot is the pacing. The show knows when to ramp up the intensity and when to dial things back and just let the characters interact with one another in casual settings. This dynamic means that there is plenty of time to watch the characters' personalities develop and to take in the setting and narrative of the show, but there are also quite a few stressful/nailbiting moments, especially around the last third of the show. Overall the narrative will keep you hooked throughout and even though you might expect some of the twists and turns, everything that happens makes sense and is satisfying.
-Art- -9/10-
While Toradora!'s art doesn't stand out as being particularly different or unique versus other anime, but it is incredible well done throughout the show. The backgrounds and objects characters interact with are well detailed and pleasing to look at, and the aesthetics revolving around important plot moments are striking and well put together. Even more than these elements though, the design and animation of the characters shines far above most other anime. Every main character(and many of the secondary ones) looks unique and is immediately distinguishable from all the other characters. One of the two stars of the show, Taiga, particularly seems to have had a lot of work put into her design. Further contributing to how unique each character is, they are all animated differently and their facial expressions in particular do a wonderful job of conveying the emotion of important scenes. Overall the show's art and animation is clean, vibrant, and striking in all the right places, even if it is similar to a lot of other anime.
-Sound- -8/10-
Keeping in mind that I watched the dubbed version and understand very little Japanese, the voice acting seems to me to be very well done, and the emotions of the characters come clearly through the language barrier. The music is also very well done, and sets up different scenes of the show nicely. Overall the sound doesn't stick out in any particular way simply because it does its job exactly as you would want it to.
-Characters- -10/10-
Now we have come to what truly makes Toradora! such a special and unforgettable show. The characters are fleshed out and realized in a way that is unlike anything I have ever seen in anime, or any visual media for that matter. From the very beginning of the show it is clear as day that there are very few flat characters in this show. Every main and many of the secondary characters grow and change throughout its 25 episode run, and their development never once failed to impress me. The way the characters interact with each other, mainly the dialogue and pacing of conversations, is remarkable. The characters are all flawed, they all make mistakes, and unlike to many animes, they all learn from them and grow in a logical way. I was drawn into the show by some genuinely funny humor and a nice art style, but I stuck around for the best characters I have ever seen in an anime. 
-Enjoyment- -10/10-
Toradora! is a genuinely fun and funny show and even without the flawless characterization and great artwork that goes a long way. The physical humor is pretty standard anime fare but it is presented in a way that never makes it feel dumb or cliche. I blew through all 25 episodes of the show and felt more than a little devastated that there wasn't more of it for me to see. 
-Overall- -10/10-
The last two episodes of Toradora! will most likely go down as the most I have ever cried while watching any sort of TV show. The culmination of the romance between Ryuuji and Taiga is not unexpected, but is presented in an absolutely beautiful way. Even if you don't have an interest in the genre(I certainly didn't before watching this show) Toradora! stands out as an absolutely amazing anime that any fan of the medium should be able to enjoy. Drop what you are doing and go watch this show.",10

                [I usually prefer the action,adventure or mystery genres but made an exception for Toradora! in order to complete an item in the anime watching challenge, plus it's very popular and I guess i wanted a break from the types of anime I usually watch.]
My review:
From the very first episode, Toradora seemed like a fun anime; great characters and good laughs. I actually really appreciated they way it was funny, that being with almost zero cringe, which is pretty hard to see these days (in american series and the few anime i've seen so far). It was fun to watch and I wouldn't have realized that
                  I'd watched 12 episodes in a row if I hadn't gotten hungry. Story is pretty good and original, no meet-and-fall-in-love here. Watching the characters and the relationships between them evolve is the best part. The quality is about the same in all the episodes without the plot repeating itself. Not really anything especially bad or good about the animation; the music is okay I guess, the thing I liked about it was the 1st opening because it felt like a great match for the whole thing.
Tbh, loved this anime and 10/10 would watch again, seriously thought about rating it with 10 but I just can't really call it a masterpiece, probably because it's not my favorite genre.
A lil' tip about the last episode, don't miss the actual ending that starts after the credits roll out, it's really worth it!",9
"
                [Some spoilers ahead] 
If you could comment on reviews, I guarantee this one would probably get a lot. 
I didn't like Toradora, at all. I'll admit, it had me in the first couple of episodes. I was interested to see where it could go, and the plot was something I haven't watched before. BUT, you can't tell me it wasn't predictable. The two MC's aim is to help each other get with their best friend (the summary is up there, no need to clarify what I mean). And what usually happens in those situations? They end up spending loads of time together, ofc, because they
                  know the way to their best friends' heart and can help each other out. Oh, and ofc they live right next to each other. Typical plot device. Then they fall in love. In fact, they got together so randomly that I couldn't believe what just happened after the episode had finished. It felt so anti-climatic. All that, for them to just... get together? I don't know, I didn't get it. 
Ryuuji I actually liked as the MC. I'd probably of given this a 1 if he wasn't how he was. He was a decent MC. Rarely ever frustrated me, wasn't dense as a brick, though he easily took all of Taiga's crap and that's one of his deepest flaws. Not to mention, I couldn't even tell when he started to fall for her. I knew when she started falling for him, that one was subtle but obvious, but him? No clue. 
Taiga. She's the typical overly aggressive, but *cute* type who's known for her violent nature. She's the pretty little rich girl with family problems and that's probably why she hates everyone. This character is copied and pasted. The ONLY thing I like about Taiga, is her friendship with Minori and the development she has with Ami. I don't see why anyone would like her, let alone fall in love with her. 
Toradora, for me, was one of the worst romance's I've ever seen. I didn't enjoy it. There were so many instances I was bored and just had to push through. It had some interesting episodes that I liked, and like I said, some of the characters are decent. But everything just frustrated me. Why did Minori give up her love for Ryuuji? Why was Taiga put first? Plot device blah blah blah, can't have the two MC's not end up with each other. 
Maybe my review would've been different if Taiga didn't have the personality she had and if Minori had actually been selfish and owned up to her feelings. I'm fine (HUGE overstatement) with slow burn romances, even ones that are so goddamn slow it makes me want to die, because at least they end up together. But animes that leave feelings untouched and unsaid make me want to scream. I don't get it, and I don't think I ever will. 
This was a huge miss for me. I'm aware this opinion isn't a popular one among those who've watched it, but I've seen enough romances to know this doesn't even begin to touch romance animes like Blue Spring Ride, Fruits Basket, Kamisama Kiss, Tada Never Falls in Love, Wotakoi, Snow White with the Red Hair, I've Always Liked You etc etc. So many other better romances, wouldn't recommend this to anyone who loves any of the animes I've mentioned.",2
"
                Read at your own risk, this review contains mild spoilers.
For your information: This is NOT a fanboy-ed review of Toradora!.
Instead, it's my first impressions after finishing the anime.
It's been like 6 hours since I've finished the anime, and I'm still sad (to the point of crying) because I finished it! There hasn't been an anime I enjoyed as much as this one. Since the very start, I was sad because I knew it had to end. 
Toradora gained my heart so much, that it became my #3 favourite anime, above FMAB and under Clannad AS.
Starting with Story, rated 10/10, it's like glue. As soon as
                  you watch the first five episodes, you are lost. You will be immersed in this wonderful, romantic, comedic but also dramatic history.
*Spoilers ahead*
After they come back from Kawashima's vacation home, the ambient turns more serious, focusing more and more in the romantic-dramatic side of the story (although in episode 8 when Ami and Taiga swim, after Takasu almost drowns, Aisaka claims that he is hers), we confront Takasu's doubts of who he really loves. Then in episode 16 when Taiga beats down that b*tch from the Council of Students, the anime completely undergoes a drastic change, changing the opening, and the new topic is: achieving goals (so that would be, forcing Takasu to be with Minorin and Taiga with Kitamura). But, will those goals be achieved actually? Oh, them feels and that cliche ending. *End of spoilers*
Art was quite simple yet beautiful. Rated 8/10, I missed some filters and those little details that make an anime enjoyable for our eyes, but the drawing makes it for these smalls details.
Sound was another strong aspect of Toradora. Being used to hear Rie Kugimiya as Happy in Fairy Tail, she has shown me that she can be an amazing little, beautiful, yet aggressive girl. All the seiyuus were perfectly chosen for each role of the anime, and music is simply amazing.
Openings are ideal just for the context (happy-romantic, and serious-drama-romantic).
And that song you hear just at the beginning, ""Yasashisa no Ashioto"", gains my heart everytime. I get goosebumps just from hearing it.
And if you want to cry, hear Lost my pieces. *Spoilers* Oh, that moment where Taiga cries calling Ryuuji. Oh my good lord. That moment made me shed various manly tears. *End of spoilers*
Characters... I loved them all. Yes, no joke. That's why it's rated 10/10.
I'd say Taiga was my favourite, but she is too much overused so I don't want to sound too stereotipical ^^ haha. But yes, I definetely love her.
Takasu Ryuuji, I laughed so hard with him, you tend to miss characters like this. No, damn it, you need people like this in real life!
Also, I loved Ami. Besides being beautiful, she is the most serious and mature character in the series.
Inko-chan!! At the end we hear this little monster say her name, too bad Ryuuji wasn't there to hear it.
And then the extras, Noto, Haruta, Kihara, Kashii and specially Yuri, the teacher, make you feel you're really in the school, just watching everything from your point of view.
Enjoyment, rated 10/10.
I loved this anime from minute 1 of the first episode, until minute 23 of the last episode. Enough said.
Laughed. Cried like a girl. Got anxious, CRIED because the anime HAD ENDED.
Overall 10/10.
I would explain more but everything's explained in each specific point.
Goodbye!!",10
"
                If you like watching generally likeable characters repress their emotions for over 20 episodes, then this show is for you. 
It was definitely not for me.
Its only saving grace in my eyes is that I loved the main character, but that was not enough to make this show enjoyable. In 25 episodes, there were only about 5 episodes worth of plot, and a whole lot of nothing dragging out the rest of the show for some reason. It should have been 12 episodes max. I forced myself through the entire thing, hoping I would understand just what makes this show so loved by everyone, and
                  I still don’t get it. If you don’t like this show by ep 6 or 7, you should probably save yourself the trouble.",3
"
                Coming across Toradora at first the few episodes might throw you off, but don't be fooled. This anime is one for the ages.
Every main character in this anime goes through a development. There might be a time when you don't like so-and-so but that will change. The anime itself has a pretty interesting art style to it especially during the more serious scenes and one certain scene near the end.
The music and sound are both great. The music fits well even the typical anime music found in every show fits well. 
The only biggest flaw is how they failed to incorporate the light novel completely
                  making for a less-than-perfect but amazing ending. The show itself is great. It does have a very comedic tone at the start and a very dramatic tone in the end and it really does play off itself, its character, and its setting very well. 
Bottom Line: This is probably one of my favorite romance animes and Probably one of the best I've seen in a damn damn long time. I wish I could see more of these characters. I really do since honestly? They are just all so enjoyable and lovable.",10
"
                First time giving a review here. SPOILER
Story: Well, I liked the idea of the show. Helping each other to win their respective crushes' heart but end up liking each other. Made me cry in some parts especially the part where Ryujii said those things to his mom and knowing the backstory of her. Damn that's quite sad. Imagine being pregnant at 15 and then raising your son alone. Quite a tragic backstory if you ask me. Bad ending tho, I don't really understand why leave after deciding that you should be together? Like what? That was really anti-climatic. Confession? Done. Promised that they would be
                  together? Done. Time to left then. I get it, it was to repair Taiga relationship with her family but it just doesn't make sense to dip like that lmao. The only reason I give it a 7 because it ended normally, no cliffhanger bs. 
Art: Nothing really considering the year it was produced
Sound: Nothing special
Character: Boy oh boy, Taiga was really a effing bitch innit? Like wtf how can Ryujii stay in a relationship with someone like that. Yes it was an anime but fking hell mate, how was that sweet whatsoever. Selfish, short-tempered, violent, ungrateful bitch lmao and the only thing developed was her love towards Ryujii and some minor parts like her decision to fix her family relationship etc. Hell even Ami had better character development than her. Minorin is just obnoxiously optimistic and I don't understand her friendship with Taiga. They claimed they are bff but can't even sort out their feelings toward Ryujii. Kitamura character after the president confession was like just a placeholder for something to happen. Block the door, here. Pretend that he saved Taiga, here. 
Overall: I think the show is overrated tbh. People claimed that it was very good and I decided to give it a go and it;s okay I guess. It's not that bad but I was left disappointed with the show because of the impression from reviews I've read.",6
"
                ( spoilers )
Well where to start..
I like these kind of anime where they don't leave the ending open and where a couple is actually formed instead of leaving it open at the end so you can imagine what you'd like.
However i can't feel disappointed with this one.
The story:
I give this a 5 cus it is all over the place with jumps here and there at random.
There is no real build-up between the main characters and somewhere in the middle it seems they suddenly had a change of heart to who will be with who..
You are starting with the two main characters who each have their
                  crush and they team up together in the hope to win their hearts over...But then one of them get's shut down and the other isn't allowed to say how he feels , then out of nowhere the other main get's feelings for the other , everybody notices except ofc the mail main and he has to forget his feelings for the stupid reason that he spend time together and his crush feels guilty and she thinks the two mains suddenly should be together even tho she has mutual feelings...
So apparently the mains feelings change cus well the other main says she has feelings...
I hated this tbh i was hoping for an original storyline where Minori and Ryuuji would grow closer OR what i was hoping for all season long that somehow Kawashima would end up with Ryuuji as a big surprise coming over her flaws and growing as a character but i got disappointed and this series became this fan thing for lolly cons where the small girl get's a love story...
The more i watched the more i was thinking ""oh pls no..."" And in the end i regretted watching it.
The ending was so random , it was as if they dragged on for 20 episodes , realised they only had 4 left and then made a random turn in whatever direction the wind was going.
Adding drama wherever they had a whole to try and make it an interesting watch , instead of making the story feel like it was going somewhere and not making you feel like the first 15 episodes where a filler and the next 5 where a diffrent story following by the last episodes making a quick slot cus they ran out of episodes, funding and time...
The whole build-up for something original was somewhat there which is the reason i feel like they went from something potentially amazing with more episodes then the usual anime and screwed it up 
Art:
Also on point , nice drawings.
This anime has tons of locations and backgrounds change a lot so you have the feeling you are all over the city which is nice and not repetitive so a solid 10 
Sound:
Overall just great , nothing bad to say about this.
Music on point , voice acting very well done.10
Character:
Well there is no character build-up except maybe for Ryuuji and Taiga so that should be a dead giveaway that every other character becomes obsolete later on.
Again the ending makes me feel like the whole Minori story and even Ami are there to fill airtime...Not even talking about the supporting characters that could easily have been left out cus they had no real role or meaning.
Just a very disappointing story that just still leaves me with the feeling why did i start to care about half of them  and i really don't like a Tsundere character type so i give this a 5
  Enjoyment
Mediocre 5 , the few times i laughed where actually rare for an anime that is supposed to be funny 
The story feels more like random filler kind half of the anime 
The ending was for me disappointing and this is def not worth watching again for me
Overall i give this anime a 5
It has some good moments but they get sidetracked ,forgotten or are in the end looking back to few to give this anime more then a 5
It left me wondering why this was so hyped up in the first place and just asking why? looking at how the story evolves.",5
"
                Toradora, Toradora, Toradora.
 This is all my opinion. If you like this show, great! But I did not like the second half. This is fully personal/subjective. I am fully prepared to get rekt for this review. Have at you, lovers of Toradora!
 To start, the story. SPOILERS!
 TL:DR; A boy named Ryuuji with slanty evil eyes meets a girl named Taiga who breaks into his house and attempts to murder him brutally with a wooden sword in order to keep her crush on his best friend a secret. Hilarity ENSUES!
 Yeah. That's the spoiler-free version. Continuing, Ryuuji has a crush in TAIGA'S best friend. They
                  attempt to help each other with the romantic pursuits of each other's best friends, but end up falling in love with each other. Shocker. it's not like the ending is LITERALLY THE TITLE, ELIMINATING ALL ELEMENT OF SURPRISE, but I digress. This was a romantic comedy, and was actually funny for about 15ish episodes. Then it turned into a soap opera. A very annoying one. The only reason I didn't drop this show after the stupid shit started happening was the surprising amount of bitch fights. Like when Taiga attempted to murder some chick with a sword for not being in love with her (ex?)crush. Good times.
Art: No complaint.
Sound: The first OP was like the first half of the show; fun, bouncy and very addictive. The second OP was kinda meh, but with a good beat. The OST was forgettable. The voice acting was great. Props to Taiga's voice actor for being able to be a sociopathic monster in a perfect way.
Character: I have been waiting to write THIS section. I'll start with Ryuuji. WHY THE FLYING FUCK DID YOU GIVE UP MINORI FOR TAIGA YOU DUMBASS??!?!??! He is literally an angel, but he is too DAMN STUPID FOR MY LIFE.  How can such a nice person have such shit taste? You could have had a nice girl, like MINORI, but no. You choose HER. There's dense, and this fucker is a black hole. DEAR LORD save me from male harem-leaders.
 Now Taiga. HOW ON EARTH DOES ANYONE LOVE HER? I may be biased against tsunderes naturally, but even that could NOT distract me from the fact that she is just a bad person. In the first episode, she fucks up her confession, and stalks Ryuuji to his house, breaks in and TRIES TO KILL HIM WITH A SWORD. HAVE I MENTIONED THIS. CALM YO CALAMITIES, CRAZY. And then for the rest of the show she verbally and physically abuses Ryuuji, and nearly EVERYONE around her. Her tsun level is freaking over 9000. Off the charts. I have yet to see her redeeming trait in the entire show. Lets count off; she's friends with Minori, and steals the boy she likes because FUCK HER apparently, she constantly abuses Ryuuji until he gets fucking Stockholm syndrome apparently, because I don't know how he fell for her unless he's a super masochist, she KNEES her dad in the nuts, refuses to talk to her mom because FUCK HER TOO, and is a general all around bitch. I honestly cannot see why people like her, because I CANNOT STAND HER. Her level of tsun can only be eclipsed by Louise from The Familiar of Zero, but not for lack of trying. Taiga is a character whom I cannot like. I hate her so much. She is essentially why I hated this show.
The other characters, were ok. I loved Kitamura (being voiced by the Bosch may have done that) and Minori was awesome. Ami was mildly interesting, too. That bird pissed me off tho.
 Overall; I didn't hate this show. Actually, I really liked the firsthalf. It was like an 8. It kept me laughing, and I anticipated each new episode with joy. When it was clear that the show was no longer a comedy, I hated it. It was so freaking melodramatic I could not bear to watch. I finished the show out of completionism and a vague glimmer of hope that the show would redeem itself. (It didn't) The second part of the show was like a 2 for me. Average it out, and we got a score of 4. But I'll give it a six because watching Taiga get punched in her bitch face during that bitch fight deserves 2 points.
Ok, with that off my chest, come at me, fanboys/girls.",6
"
                After watching the first 6 episodes, you can say, I was so hyped for the rest of the story. I thought this would easily be on the top 5 animes I've watched. But I was mistaken.
The story had a good approach and had so much potential. But after the 13th episode, it made me a little bored, but I thought, maybe it'll get boring for a bit and then better a few episodes later. It didn't, the story just didn't feel right and then eventually the ""gang"", or the group of the 5 main characters just slipt up, one character hating this one and another
                  hated that one. It just made me disappointed in the story. It had a few good jokes here and there and for the ending, it kinda made it up for it.
Story - 5/10:
At the beginning, the story was just simply put, amazing. But then it felt like it got worse and worse as it went on. if just felt, not as good after they started hating one another. I was mainly enjoying when they spent their time together, and it's another one of those typically animes where they're in love with someone they knew awhile ago, new character steps in, they fall in love.
They could've sciped it up a bit if you know what I mean.
Art - 7/10:
For the time it was made, the art is surprisingly modern -- or just that the art style hasn't really changed as significantly as you'd expect it might from over 10 years ago.
Sound - 9/10:
The sounds for footsteps, things falling over, and all that were surprisingly well, the sounds felt natural and like if it were real life, it'd make those sounds as it was in the anime. It was excellent.
Character(s) - 8/10:
The designs for the character just felt right with me, it just sat right. I don't know how to explain it. The development was also pretty good and suiting for how the story went.
Enjoyment - 6/10:
As I somewhat said earlier, it was the most enjoyable in the beginning. But then, it just decreased and decreased and decreased. I wished they just didn't make everyone hate each other for the last 1/4 of the anime, and the end they weren't mean to each other, but before, they somewhat were. Like Ami to Miniori and Ryuuji. If it were jokingly, friendly way, or even in a not-serious way, I'd had enjoyed it more. But it really felt like pure hatred.
Overall - 6/10:
This concludes my first review that I wrote at 2:20AM and I am too tired to proofread or chec k for any errors ok gn, yea.",6
"
                I'll keep my review short and sweet. Switch the genders of the two main characters and watch this show again. I'll wait. It would be a show about a disgusting abusive short man constantly being violent and demanding towards a sweet and misunderstood girl who likes to cook and clean. 
Taiga has zero redeeming qualities as a human being. It is a complete mystery why Ryuji stays with her for any length of time, barring his exceptionally forgiving nature coupled with a good dose of Stockholm Syndrome.
The fact that this show has so many ratings above 5 horrifies me about what people think is tolerable
                  in human relationships (romantic or otherwise). If someone treats you the way Taiga treats Ryuji, you need to run as fast as humanly possible in the opposite direction.
I don't know how this show proceeds after episode 11 (because I'm not a masochist) but I assume the two leads end up together. In that case, this show is missing a MAL tag: Horror.",1
"
                Toradora is an anime that please to some and not to others. For me it is like a recipe in which was placed known ingredients but with perfect amounts and a secret, making the dish much less common than expected. In short, not necessarily original, but good taste is present. Let me explain.
Characters:
Stereotypes are mostly found there.
The protagonist, Ryuuji, is this nice and shy guy, people avoid him because of his scary physics. He is secretly in love with a girl in his class, Minori, but never confessed. It is also, unfortunately, as often in the stories of this kind, soft. A little less than
                  average I would say, even if it leaves to walk on by Taiga, he is not stupid and it is quite endearing and funny with his side of housewife model.
Taiga is the tsundere. Small, aggressive, she is also in love but does not know how to confess. It may annoy some people, but behind his violent side, a strong will is hidden. She has evolved over the anime and she got really endearing to the end.
Taiga's best friend, Minori, is Ryuuji’s Secret love. She is the embodiment of good humour. You know the one who is always smiling even she is not in good condition. Her interventions are pretty funny in general and she is touching and not whingeing.
Well, I must talk about Kitamura, but to be honest, that's the one I like the least. Ryuuji's best friend, Taiga has a crush on him. He is always nice guy, hard worker, with glasses. I will not tarry longer because he gets on my nerves, it's a real kid.
Finally, Taiga’s childhood friend, Ami, top model, the nice and adorable with her""friends"" but she is actually rather cold and calculating. She is probably the most mature of the five. She helps her friends while pretending not to care. She is important in the development of relations between the characters.
We also have a gaggle of pretty funny supporting characters (but not very developed) special mentions to the teacher and the parrot. You will understand by watching.
Graphics:
This is not the strong point of the anime. The scenery is simple and redundant, bright colours (it does not bother me at all for this kind of anime but others might not like it). The chara-design, you would think they had a budget for the main characters: half for Taiga, which is cute and the other half is divided roughly equally between Ryuuji, Minori and Ami, which are rather common but fun to watch.
In short, overall it is rather clean and fluid but not amazing.
Story:
There is really no scenario in this anime, we only follows the evolution of the characters. The beginning laid the foundation and their relationships, Taiga and Ryuuji who find themselves accomplices despite themselves. The first part is a pure comedy because we follow their wacky attempts to approach their crushes. We are witnessing really funny moments, some more sad. Then there is the part with Kitamura which is, in my opinion, the worst of the anime. I really do not understand why Taiga loves him ... Then, the Christmas part when Taiga starts to change, and she gets really interesting, you start to appreciate her more. Everyone tries to cope with his feelings in his way, and the end is still surprising on some points.
Music:
Music is a strong point. The Openings are great, the endings correspond very well to the changing feelings, OSTs perfectly accompanying the various scenes sad, happy ... Nothing else to say, I love it.
Overall, Toradora is a good slice of life anime that seems full of already-seen but the director was able to dose the ingredients to perfection: we find the right balance between comedy and romance, with passable graphics and very good soundtrack to address the whole.",8
"
                INTRODUCTION: THE GENRE WE LOVE
If there are any genres out there that exist in a more overdone state, it would probably be the Slice of Life Young Adult Romcomdrama. The genre's criteria are as follows. It's basis is a Coming-of-Age story, but usually details the growth of a set of two rather than merely a single individual, with both boy and girl playing off each other. The comedy is usually backed in the form of slapstick with a tinge towards Otaku archetypes and in-jokes. Dates and certain events are given precedent, such as a beach-trip or Valentine's day, corresponding to the study-cycle of a Japanese
                  High School student, and, of course, its set in High School.
Now the criteria is quite fixed, but loose enough to allow for different variants, such as works involving a tinge of the fantastic, or science-fiction works. Either way, despite that the structure mainly plays out the same way. The heft, then, is on the interaction of the characters, the growth, and the sparkling romantic school melodrama.
One of the primary abuses of the genre is to overplay the comedy, so as to give the illusion of longevity, when in fact all that is going on on screen is aloof meandering with different running gags and characters screwing around without any insight to their development. This is what I like to call the 'Key tactic'. It's a spawn of what happens when you base your work of the Visual Novel structure, which incorporates multiple fodder writers to embellish content, while being forced into the multiple-heroine style one-by-one epiphany route. This form is popcorn entertainment. The characters only shine when a well written arc really takes off the ground, and when it equalizes back to a normal state, the character that was previously involved in the 'epiphany' remains as a static puppet to the endless barrage of running gags.
So in an ideal world, the baseline standard for the genre would have to be Toradora. Anybody trying to write the same tripe simply has to ask, ""Is it functionally or technically better than Toradora?"", ""Do the characters play off better than Toradora?"" and ""Are the epiphanies or key character growth moments as well-earned as Toradora?"". Production companies would have to collude together to create the Takemiya Constitution as a bid to eliminate the growing spawn of shoddy SoLYARcd from the shelves.
Even then, take note that I set Toradora as the 'baseline'. If I would have my way it would have as tight a plot structure and as cathartic the highs as Kokoro Connect (despite the abuse of Deus Ex Machinas), as keen an eye for the natural as Paradise Kiss or BECK, or as calculative and analytical as Oregairu, and, of course, as experimental a spirit as the Monogatari series, Utena or Evangelion. I would even love it to be as mature as certain aspects of Golden Time or White Album 2.
So this review will function on two levels. I'll critique the work within the bounds set by the genre, then I'll even more harshly critique the work outside set genre bounds, in the greater realm of Literature and all other works out there. I believe that this will show why we love the genre so much, but also show its definite limits, its immaturity, and its lost potential.
SECTION 1: MEANDERING LOVE
The plot of Toradora (which is different from the narrative) is quite simple. The two protagonists work together to get at their respective love interests, each being the 'wingman' for the other, but as it continues emotions get mixed up and things become even more complicated. Every character is based on an archetype, that is equally complicated. On the surface level, Ryuuji is a nice guy whose identity is complicated by his face. The surface symbolism here is merely the first step to the later delvings. Taiga is a Tsundere who is complicated by her archetype formed through trauma and neuroses, and she later displays equal parts fragility, warmth, kindness, rationality, understanding, and courage, as opposed to her character type usually being streamlined as passionately hot-headed and comedically bipolar. Minori is, likewise, the archetypal happy-go-lucky girl who is complicated by her extreme energetic passion being underlined with an extreme obsessiveness and irritation. She fits the standard of most extroverts out there more to a key, in that she sometimes takes her emotional core over the edge when confronted with an attack against her ideals, but also displays great self-awareness in her ability to control her environment so that she doesn't succumb to her internal passions. Thus paradoxically she becomes the most calculative and also the most hot-headed. Finally, the later arrival Ami, is a model with a good-girl facade that is actually calculatingly narcisstic, once again another 'surface' complication played for laughs, but later she becomes the person most aware of the various faces people bear and comes out as the most clear-headed of the lot.
If there was any problem I would say that Ryuji isn't really complicated beyond his bad-face/good-guy nature, but that isn't a critique of how Takemiya has portrayed his character. He's the foundational stability of the whole group and he's the person that always pushes things beyond through his unwavering nature, like most other straightforward Anime heroes, and yet he's still portrayed as having problems of his own, especially related to his family. He's plausible, basically, even though he holds all the stale notions of the archetype that Takemiya would relentlessly destroy in her later Golden Time (by making Tada Banri headstrong but ruthlessly selfish about his emotions). Furthermore he's also a flawed person in that he rides on his own immaturity at times without understanding the whole situation. (Another logical end to this archetype would be Araragi Koyomi or Kokoro Connect's Taichi. I don't count the Kiritsugu family because Nasu doesn't really write good characters and is better at concepts and settings).
I guess despite being one of the core components of the plot and also one of the supporting cast, the most invisible character happens to be Kitamura, who is also quite static and definitely also fits into an archetype of a best friend character. But this staticity also makes sense given the implication that he was a more immature character in the past, and the now being closer to his end state; an ideal of neutrality. This is also the key moment in his arc when he reverts to his non-neutral old state, and also happens to play in later later during certain moments when his neutrality gets in the way at some points.
And besides that there's a core series of lesser supporting cast members, some merely existing as running gags, but others at least being given one or two moments of character.
So Toradora has the benefit of having all the conflicts arise either from character, or within the realm of character. Nothing really occurs from an unseen happenstance. Furthermore the best part is its ability to capture the wayward flitting nature of young love. Characters adopt initial poses, then flit to other cores, while simultaneously remaining within the shell of the old one. The primary two interlocking triangles Kitamura - Taiga - Ryuji - Minori are what drives the motion forwards.
Incidentally a resembling triangle is Iori - Taichi - Inaba from Kokoro Connect, with one being an energetic girl with a dual side (and WHAT a dual side it is. It's a plain crime that Aki Toyosaki doesn't get more dramatic roles, being either as or more capable than Yui Horie in representing all kinds of extremes in character) and the protagonist attaching himself to that girl because of a false pre-conceived notion of the type of person she is. But both triangles never reach the complex highs of Oregairu or White Album 2 in their characters being a lot more than just dual-sided, but multi-faceted, manipulative, and dripping with drama.
Apparently a question has been raised though, mainly that why would Ryuji and Taiga get together anyway, with one being more or less a spoiled loafer, and the other being kind and domestic. Well that question would make sense if intentions were single in character and not born out of continuous variations and mixed intentions. Obviously we see that Ryuji derives his need for order because of his hopelessly untidy mother. This can easily transfer as initial pity for Taiga. Secondly he's interested in the outcome of the dual-friendships with Minori and Kitamura, being concerned with his friends. Thirdly, more than just pitying her background, he empathizes (This being the keyword) with her family past, being in the same situation, and this comes to culmination in the 'roaring-9' finale episodes.  Not only do they sync well in their interactions, but they literally understand each other's problems, and that is the basic requirement for a connection, which any amount of improper distribution of labor cannot possibly tear apart. And she's also the one who, in times of the greatest crisis, is trying to pull the whole group together while people like Minori or Kitamura are going off on their passions. And the most important is OF COURSE THEY'RE YOUNG AND IDIOTIC, which is something that so nicely plays itself out in the finale, and both of them being impossibly young and idiotic together is what sets them together against everything out there, and being young and idiotic means you believe that love can exist without the type of long and hard compromises that, in the long run, can destroy marriages born out of unstable foundations. Takemiya understands that completely and doesn't need people to tell her that the relationship seems a bit off, except that she agrees and gives the two characters space for necessary growth from their own respective neuroses. This compromise would be played and challenged to its fullest in Golden Time which deals with mature adults (albeit with a very very ridiculous and bad dual-personality plot device). With that said, lets get into that whole thing about Growth:
SECTION 2: GROWTH
Now, the primary aim of your average SoLYARcd is nostalgia, but also growth. A work that basks in childishness doesn't dignify the human condition. But countless slice of life shows out there are anti-thetical to this idea, usually playing it all off in a haphazard 'graduation ceremony' that nicely knots off a series of characters without worthy development to that graduation. All your Lucky Stars or Azumanga Daiohs or the initial seasons of Key Works all lack that upwards breeze that pushes a character the way that a series like ARIA or Paradise Kiss can (and Paradise Kiss, or BECK, even though both have quite a forward narrative, is, what I'd argue to be a true SoLYARcd that honors the Slice of Life part of the bargain).
And the characters do grow in Toradora. Taiga receives the most facets throughout the whole show. She starts off displaying her archetypal traits until her first main arc in the middle, where she switches over to an almost complete opposite kind of timidity and passivity, reconciling both by the end of that, and all the later moments play on this growing satellite of traits, which is where she truly shines in the 'roaring-9' episodes. That's why the whole series centers on Taiga, rather than Ryuji, because if you think about it only the both of them really grow by the end, and her growth is in larger culminative spades. The other 3 are complex, but rather than growth, its just that more of their already pre-existing facets are revealed over time. In fact that's the whole thrust of Minori's conflicted character, being a character that is truly 'complete' but realizing that her completeness does not sync at all with the direction the lives of her friends are going. She knows everything she wants and her pragmatism forces her to burn bridges.
Furthermore the growth has to be seen as positive, tender, and kind, and not the kind of growth by hellfire that occurs in a war-drama like Now and Then, Here and There or Evangelion. With that Toradora is wholehearted in its approach. The critical moments are all born from friendship and aid, with the hot-blooded kind of youth that characterizes Anime in general. The growth is also given the rose tinted lens that befits the tender age of rebellion and no-compromises, where everything rests on the feeling that what is important is the eternal Now. The whole ending, in its clear cut 'grown-up' reality and refuting of this fact is possibly one of the greatest denouements to occur in the whole history of the genre (until we get Paradise Kiss, of course, which just pushes the whole thing so far to places I can't even possibly begin to describe).
SECTION 3: EVALUATION
On the genre's terms, for its time, Toradora is pretty much astounding. The character complexity intimates Kokoro Connect, and much much later, Oregairu. Animation is fluid. Everything plays its part. Archetypes are destroyed with kindness and compassion. And it fits the requirements of celebrating the nostalgia for young life, detailing the complex fluidity of love, and accentuating smooth character growth with a perfect conclusion that reconciles the hot-blood with reality. Thus, it sets the baseline for the genre.
SECTION 4: GRADUATION
This section is for those who wish for greater things, even at the cost of burning away your previous conceptions. Once the terms of genre are shed away, the maturity and nature of a work has to stand against everything else in the world. To do this a person's conception of life simply cannot be small, which means one cannot rely on archetypes, stock tropes, or any other form of celebration of staleness. (and while I understand the plight of the animators, I must still carry on in judgment, as that is the work of the critic)
Simply put, works have become tighter everywhere, and this means that there are excesses within Toradora that weigh it down. The aloof nature of the first 16 episodes simply places too much of a strain on the last 9, no matter how well done the final thrust is, which is why certain people misconstrue the work as being merely of other types, with a sudden 'tone shift' at the end, rather than realizing that things from the start carry over to the end. This is because the comedic spread of the first 16 episodes places the character moments too far from each other. Furthermore though the buildup in the arcs are quite dramatic, the half-comic nature of the cathartic moments undermine the effects (for true epiphany in motion, look at any of the most well-wrought episodes of KareKano to understand what can be done in a single 20 minute span). Kokoro Connect, while being more direct in its psychological nature and less subtle than Takemiya, benefits from that rolling momentum to the end. Oregairu season 2 and White Album 2 absolutely kills everything out there in its tightness. Evangelion suffers from meandering as well during its monster-of-the-week episodes but makes up for it with its complete style and Anno's cinematic eye.
Besides the Tsundere running gags, Taiga's creepiness towards Kitamura is also one, Ryuji's cleaning obsessiveness is also one, and Minori and Kitamura are pure slapstick. Note that in a higher work, every action is weighted with character intention and meaning, and while Minori's slapstick may serve to later deepen the duality of her character later, there is still quite a lot of excess. It is the ridiculous auteurism of both Anno and Osamu Kobayashi, that they even know how to maximize the placing of the ending segue for full impact (as I examined in my blog post that breaks down Evangelion's silences). Toradora still links itself to its ending song and has to work off the episodes climactic cuts to play into the next episode.
SECTION 5: BLEEDING EDGE LOVE
Even a work like Evangelion can still reek of psychological flaws in characterization. For example Anno's too insistent use on Freudian motivations to posture everything as a parental problem, which ruined one of the greatest episodes in the series (episode 15). While I went on about Toradora's character complexity, I realize that the problem with initially attaching to an archetype then subverting, rather than making a multi-faceted character from the start, is too much having to place a burden on the subversion. Oregairu, which builds its characters on realistic aspects of the culture, down to the Gyaru lingo, as well as playing a cynical character straight, can sidestep this quite nicely when the major arcs hit. It was quick to drop its parodistic trappings from Haganai and set up the complex character chains within the student festival arc. By the time Season 2 came in, everything was rich in intention and counterintention layered on top of one another.
Likewise Toradora suffers from some bad conditions, like I said, due to its genre premises. Being rose-tinted, jealousy cannot reach beyond a certain level so as to become wholly acerbic or destructive. Friends must stay friends and gracious concession is the norm (although the ingenuity comes from the fact that the real drama starts due to a simultaneous double concession). What's more, everything is shifted so that the struggle becomes against authority, that is, the useless adults. Which means that all backstories must also be quite Freudian in its parental woes. The root of Kitamura's arc is also the most major Deus Ex Machina force-plotted conflict of the show, behind Taiga's initial arc (which was necessary to set up things in the finale though).
I foresee an alternate universe where Fumiaki Maruto would team up with Woody Allen to rewrite Toradora, and Taiga would have no woeful backstory but merely be a rather spoilt WASPy girl forcing herself onto the humble middle-class Ryuji out of some PC farce. The plot would be given the adequate poison needed to push it to a tight pure-drama... or it could just be called A Streetcar Named Desire or something. While Takemiya wrote the plot to fit the premises, some of the premises really need to be changed.
Either way, although I gave reasons for the relationship being upheld, it is quite less likely to be maintained in the long run. But then again we have Golden Time, which is essentially the complementary work to Toradora. Sadly Golden Time suffers from very very wayward plotting (to say it nicely).
I compared Takemiya to Dostoyevsky before, and I was primarily thinking about the main struggle in The Brothers Karamazov, where the proud Katerina attaches herself to who she does not love, solely out of arrogance and face. I am also thinking of Chekhov's The Seagull, where the longingly immature Trigorin attaches and arbitrarily destroys the young actress Nina out of boredom. Or the pure Woody Allen examination of Love: Husbands and Wives, which is far above everything in terms of its knowledge of what goes on in a relationship, and the various things that can taint an intention or romance. That aspect is missing from a work dealing with the fluidity of human relations, that is captured fully in White Album 2, and partially in Oregairu.
I think the genre has become quite exhausted in its possibilities, and people should turn their sights even more upwards to get at the heart of human nature. 
SECTION 6: TRANSCENDENCE
From its roots the Coming-of-Age story has hit quite a roof. Catcher in the Rye perfected the tone and got the dual structure of Holden's biases versus adult reality quite right. Oregairu also has that element. Toradora only really has it at the end. White Album 2 breaks the barrier, but I haven't seen Closing Chapter so I can't say what it becomes. Outside of characterization, Herman Hesse has pulled off the mystical growth aspect to quite its full potential. Eventually the work must be about the full Human and his or her place in the world, and be a communication of those aspects deeply and rightfully dear to us, across the whole span of the age, rather than just existing through the narrow funnel of a period of tummultence.
Take a look at the knowledge in Paradise Kiss for example, that sets it at a station piles apart from anything else in its genre. Yukari runs away from home, and when she returns she's slapped by her mother. This incident is dealt with in voice-over, and only skips to the event episodes later. The adaptation works off the knowledge that the whole manga its adapting is a full sappy shoujo melodrama, but it does amazing things with an eye for detail. The way it looks back on the whole events of the story is so cool and detached, ebbing with maturity, as if basking in the knowledge of knowing the limitations of the genre form. Even in the final episode, when things are drawing down, comes one of the most startling moments of jealousy that just places all the characters you've known already into a new light, that these are flawed people, and in a way Yukari is also flawed but by the end, even with its melodrama, the ending plays it off with that coolness all the time. Anno can pull off the same thing sometimes in KareKano by prying deeply into the rampant insecurities of young romance while maintaining a complete adherence to the manga. And don't get me started on BECK's complete anthropology of youth subculture and Japan's relation to foreign cultures.
If we were truly blessed, we would have framing and understanding of how to set up a narrative on that level, along with a characterization complexity that places people in relation to other real throbbing people.
SECTION 7: THE FUTURE
Understanding of within the genre, as well as around the genre, serves an understanding of what the Art can truly do. And its understanding of that that first leads to greater things.
But either way I guess for now its okay to look at idiotic SoLYARcds and their idiotic counterparts.",9
"
                ToraDora, TigerDragon in English translation, is an outstanding Anime/Manga.
I would like to give kudos to the drama in this Anime/Manga.  It is an honour watching this series since it gave me an understanding on how close two people who absolutely dislike each other can end up watching each others' back.  I would highly recommend you watch the Anime; you'll not only admire the amazing artwork, but you won't miss out on any of the dramatic moments.  I love how the authors created the characters.  Ryuuji, the main male character, was an excellent example of a guy who lives a boring life
                  but experiences an adventure in his life.  Taiga, the main female character, may have had a rough relationship with her family; but after her encounter with Ryuuji, she began to enjoy her life.  I really enjoyed this manga because of the friendship and teamwork the characters established together.  After watching this series, I thought:""Why can't the REAL world be a better place? Why can't everyone learn from Ryuuji and Taiga?"".  ToraDora is an excellent series for all you fans.  Hope you all really enjoy it and I HOPE they make a second season.  XD",9
"
                Toradora is the full package: a clever story, varied cast of lovable characters, and quality art and soundtrack come together to deliver what may be the closest thing to a perfect romance anime out there. The shorter, self-contained arcs within the show tie together to form a larger narrative that does not rush its characters' progression but rather allows them to discover their feelings alongside the audience; furthermore, Toradora is one of the few anime I've encountered that keeps its entire main cast in the loop as opposed to ignoring certain characters in favor of the central two. Ryuuji is given a real personality beyond
                  being the main character and Taiga is actually a tsundere free of objectification, but you'll find yourself caring just as much about their other friends and family. 
Anyone who gives Toradora a try will be invested early, entertained throughout, and sitting on the edge of their seat right up until the conclusion. A full spectrum of emotions is invoked through each character, and the anime balances humor, drama, and romance perfectly. Having currently watched the show three times, each viewing has provided different insight and a fresh perspective on what is happening inside the characters' minds; you may even pick up on things in a rewatch which you missed entirely the first time around. The art and soundtrack are not revolutionary but amazing nonetheless, and create a beautiful aesthetic that is beaten only by brilliant story and once-in-a-lifetime characters.
If you are at all interested in romantic comedies, or even just brilliant storytelling, then I urge you to watch Toradora.",10
"
                I personally love romantic comedies, and even though I've only watched about 3 or 4 animes in this genre, I am already in love with shows like this, and Toradora specifically is one of my favorites.
So, I first started watching this when I first started exploring the ""romantic/comedy/drama/slice of life"" type genre. I personally consider Toradora a little bit of all the genres I just mentioned. I was definitely not disappointed, but it did have a few things I did not find appealing about this anime, despite me loving this genre.
The story starts off with Ryuji Takasu and Taiga Aisaka. The story unfolds, and as
                  expected, they grow closer and fonder of each other. It really shouldn't be that much of a shock, because the story is set up where they will be together pretty much all the time, and it's even in the title. I'm going to try not to have any spoilers in here. So, the story unfolds and at first it seems like these two are just trying to hook each other up with both of their crushes, Minori and Kitamura, and it seems like just any old romantic comedy, or at least for me it does. The episodes seem pretty fluid, picking up just about right where the other left off. 
I loved the humor, although it wasn't ""haha"" funny. It only made you smile a bit, and brighten your mood. The romance was nice and very romantic, I liked some of the drama, but not all of it.
Then this is where it got a bit rocky. Right in the middle of the series it shifts right into a romance/drama, when before it felt like a romance/comedy/drama. For me, it felt like there was a slight plot hole/character development hole between Episode 18 and Episode 19. At  Episode 17 and 18 it felt a little more dramatic than what it usually would be, but suddenly at Episode 19 tons of things started happening that I didn't quite understand why they were happening? Like, why was this character saying these things, and why did this character doing these things? 
At one of the later episodes, something big and shocking happens, and it seemed very blunt to me? Like all of a sudden this character is just going to act like this now. The last few episodes just seemed a little rushed to me.
The story is unique, there were some things that shocked me, I can't say what, but the story wasn't that predictable (like events happening, etc.).
I didn't really get the ending, honestly. I just didn't understand why that was the ending. Luckily it was an open ending so anything could happen!
Overall for the story, I give it an 8.
For the art, I give it an 8. I really loved the art style because all of the characters looked really beautiful/handsome, and unique yet simple, but two of the characters (Ami and Minori) looked a little bit cookie-cutterish to me. Ami did not look like a model. She is beautiful, but if she didn't tell us she was a model I would've never thought she was one. I think the art style might've changed slightly sometimes, depending on if it's a romantic scene or a dramatic/sad scene, etc. I think the way the characters were drawn really captured their personalities, and it definitely fit their characters. I think the chibi art style was a little bit excessive, though.
I definitely think the (Japanese) voice actors fit all of the characters fairly well. The English voice actors, not so much. I didn't feel like Taiga's or Ryuji's voices sounded anywhere near as I'd imagine their voices would sound like in English.
I really loved the music, especially the beginning and end songs! The soundtrack was definitely fitting with the story and the scenes. It really set the mood for the scenes (dramatic scenes, romantic scenes, sad scenes, happy scenes, etc.) I'm glad that they changed the opening and ending songs halfway through when the story started getting more dramatic, I think if they used the first opening and ending songs it wouldn't have fit the theme the show was going for, and it wouldn't really set the mood as the second open and ending themes would have. I absolutely love ""Pre-Parade"", ""My Silky Love"", and ""Vanilla Salt"" and I'm going to be listening to those songs in the future.
I love all of the characters, honestly. They all have their own quirks and bad habits, and you can't help but love all of them. Taiga is really tsundere and at first I didn't like that type of character but, for me at least, Taiga really grew on me and she's actually one of my favorite anime characters of all time. Each characters has their flaws, and I personally like that in a character. I'm not really fond of characters being perfect and having everyone like them, so it's nice to see characters with small flaws and quirks. I could only kind of relate to Taiga, but other than her I didn't really ""connect"" to any characters in a personal level, like I never once thought that I could truly relate to most of the characters. But that's not really an issue for me, but like I said, I could only relate to Taiga on the way she handles situations and how she acts. I give the characters a 9!
I very much enjoyed this anime, and I will be rewatching it yet again! If you like romantic/comedy/dramas, you'll love this anime! I think it might be good for someone who has been into anime for a little while, and I think, depending on the person, it just might be good for a newcomer! I don't know if someone who doesn't know anything about anime would like it, as I cannot speak for all of them, but maybe people like that might like this anime? 
I think this anime was very memorable and even though it has a few flaws in my opinion it is still a very good anime and I can't wait to rewatch it again! It's definitely one of my favorite animes. I scored it overall a 9. You should definitely check out Toradora if you haven't already, because it's a really amazing anime in my opinion and even if you don't connect or relate to the characters or experiences you will still enjoy this anime and pretty much all of the characters!",9
"
                This review contains spoiler
So Toradora was pretty good. Now I dont watch a lot of romantic comedy anime anyway and this genre is pretty hard to nail but this show does it suprisingly well. I cant remember the last time I enjoyed watching a rom-com as much as I did with Toradora. Why is that? well lets get started:
Plot: Toradora uses similar kinds of storytelling which isnt new, in fact its kinda cliche, but is still entertaining due to the execution being very good. 
The show likes to use quite a few arcs which dont feel completely disjointed and help to grow and further along
                  the actual story which is of two polar opposites slowly finding a connection and it is developed very smoothly. 
Of course since its set in a high school you can assume you will have your typical beach arc/episodes or the cultural festival arc/episodes which happen in EVERY SINGLE HIGH SCHOOL ANIME IVE EVER SEEN thus far but its still executed good for the most part. 
There were some nitpicks like at the end of episode 21, I thought it felt unnatural and felt like writers had written it quickly, if you have seen that scene then you will know what I mean (Taigas fall).
If you have seen my anime list tags of Toradora then will have seen that I thought one arc was kinda forced. That one is Kitamuras arc. 
Its not bad but it kinda comes out of nowhere and Kitamura completely changes in a space of 10mins and all of a sudden hes depressed and he loves the student council president and im like ""Where did this come from""? but never the less it doesnt drag the show down its just a problem I had.
Characters: Toradora takes, again, somewhat cliche character archetypes of the genre but manages to make them likeable and hell even memorable.
Theres Ryuuji who is your typical nice guy protagonist but hes got layers, hes reserved, hes nice but not too nice hes very much relatable, he has low self esteem about it himself but hes still funny and likeable and unlike other rom-com heroes he is NOT a total dick, he acts very much how someone would in this situation.
Example in episode 23 Ryuuji realises he kinda likes Taiga a bit more than he thought and handles the situation with the girl he was originally going for but instead of going, derpdy derp I dont know what to do, he handles it maturally and respectfully which I liked about him. Ryuuji is a pretty good guy and I liked him a lot.
Now onto Taiga our female lead, now I usually dont like tsunderes and its hard to talk about her because thats exactly what she is and thats how she starts off but in time she grows and becomes more understandable as to why she is so brutal and bad tempered which I wont spoil. Shes also the greatest drive of entertainment and I thought she was hilarious. Her realationship with Ryuuji is likeable, well developed and natural and funny.
Kitamura is likeable, nice, of course he does open up to in that forced arc but im glad the writers gave a shit to give him an arc and grow his character.
Minorin is actually my favourite of them all. She goes from generic, boring nice girl to quite interesting and I wanted to know more about her. i.e. in episode 3 its implied that she just puts on her cliche personality as a way to cover her deeper emotional problems and I wanted to know what they were and it kept me watching. That and her clapping scene made me really like her and made me want to really get into her personality and why she is like that.
Last one ill mention is Ami, now she starts off again as a cliche character but as the show goes on she, again, opens up and her mindset is interesting and different. Her rivalry with Taiga goes from cliche to quite funny and enjoyable. I liked her interactions with Ryuuji. I always looked forward to seeing her in episodes and im glad she was there.
Art: Animation is pretty good. Character designs are good enough that I remembered them months after watching the show. I did notice once that some characters looked off model but thats just a one off. i.e. amis neck looked too thin at one point. But it is pretty consistent.
Sound: the 1st opening is great. So catchy and awesome and how I cried when they changed it. WWHWHYYYY!!!!!!! the 2nd op is ok, taigas smile in the 2nd op always kills me. The rest of the soundtrack is pretty good and accompanies scenes very well in particular the final episode, the background music fit very nicely with what was going on and felt haunting but beautiful.
Enjoyment: Toradora is very enjoyable, its suprisingly funny and I ended up actually caring and liking the characters and plot.
Overall: Toradora is a pretty good show to watch even if you dont like rom-coms like me this one is well done. Of course I had problems with the story choices and characters saying things due to circumstances that kinda come out of nowhere, see episode 21,
(im trying to avoid spoilers so sorry if I dont make sense, message me if you wanna know what my problem with episode 21 is) I think Toradora is worth seeing and you probably should see it and I hope you enjoy it.
Do message me with feedback because I could always use some, you dont have too but still.. Thank you for reading.",8
"
                Toradora is a fun, heartwarming, and generally delightful show that manages to gradually bring in emotional complexity into an otherwise simple show. If I were to simply summarize what happens in the show it could easily be written off as an average romantic comedy, so I will point out a few things that the show does well.
There is a nice attention to detail which brings the world to life and also helps reinforce characters personalities in different ways. This can be through use of minor animation differences in how the characters walk that is very noticeable in the opening but also through scenes like one
                  where Taiga throws a trashcan at Ami and after Taiga and Ami leave together later in the scene a clip is added of Ryuuji picking the trashcan back up and putting it where it was. Not only does this sort of thing reinforce Ryuuji's tidy personality but's it's simply something that would happen if a trash can where thrown like that so it's nice to see a traditional gag like that treated realistically. Similarly when Taiga fights the student council president in an exaggerated anime style, they still have Taiga end up suspended for 2 weeks which would be an expected repercussion of a fight like that that is often not addressed.
Another element that really made Toradora enjoyable was that it had a gradual change from being lighthearted and silly to becoming much more emotionally complex and serious. This is due to the characters in the show learning more about each other which leads to you as a viewer starting to see more complexity as character motivations and personalities become clear. The life events that the characters have to deal with like family issues, the impending graduation of high school, and the impending need to confront and resolve the feelings of romance that have developed in the cast that is continuously pushed off also fuels this growth in complexity. Time not being treated like an infinite resource in this show forces the characters to stop putting off issues they don't want to address and leads to very satisfying confrontations.
The last thing I will note is that each of the 5 primary characters in Toradora serves an important role and adds an interesting perspective to all of the situations. Ryuuji is probably the most functionally mature in his ability to handle all house hold chores while also managing to be a good student in school, yet at the same time he is also one of the least mature and is very dense in terms of relationships and understanding peoples feelings. Taiga is a character that is basically a dreamer that is trying to escape her family situation where she doesn't have a place to belong. She is slightly less dense about reading other peoples emotions than Ryuuji but isn't really good at taking care of herself and Ryuuji fills that gap of a parental figure that Taiga so desperately needs. Minori, while seemingly simple at first, has the biggest facade of all of the characters that she maintains to both conceal her feelings from others and also manage her own emotions, her forceful side is what comes out to ultimately help resolve the feelings between the cast. Kitamura seems to be a little more keen on the emotions of the group than Ryuuji or Taiga but has his own troubles resolving his own romantic conflict. There is a great change in his behavior once Kanou leaves where he becomes a really fun silly guy as opposed to being uptight and proper. Ami is a character that through working as a model has a better perspective for noticing a lot of things going on as far as relationships go, but while she has maturity in perspective, she lacks maturity in confronting and managing her own emotions. So it's very interesting to see that she has a better read on the entire situation than everyone but doesn't exactly have anything that she can do about it.
While not being a complete review, the things I listed are some of the different things Toradora did to make me love the show. I highly recommend watching it if you are at all into romance and/or slice of life high school shows.

"
                Story: Nothing too unique but sets off a chain reaction of funny situations till the second half of the anime. Then things get all heart wrenching and ,at times,""gloomy"".
Art: Love the way it looks. Well animated.
Sound: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....Awesome OP & END music. love em.
Characters: Were anything but boring. You can see and feel every emotion they express.
Enjoyment: I started this anime with the intension of getting a good laugh...i did get it. then later on,as the anime progressed,it turned to something else completely. DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA(with a few laughs in between)
Overall: If you want to get a good laugh and don't mind the emotional baggage that
                  will follow,this is a good way to fill that need",8
"
                I'll keep this review very short.
Toradora! started out as a cute slice of life anime, nothing too special, but not too bad either. Unfortunately, this show managed to ruin anything it had going for it.
Within the last six episodes, not only do the characters start acting without any reason or rhyme, the story is also all over the place and seemingly doesn't know how to come to its own conclusion.
The ending is bizarre, rushed, and to be frank doesn't make any sense.
Had this show come to a conclusion after 19 episodes, I would have found it a very sweet and enjoyable one. Too bad the
                  writers wanted to keep it going for too long.",4
"
                If you're looking for an anime that will literally have you smiling for the first half of the series then choose Toradora! The anime is absolutely hilarious with the shenanigans between Ryuuji and Taiga throughout the series/ The cuteness level of Taiga also surpasses any other anime girl on my list even later on when the anime becomes more serious. I really hope you give this a chance as this is an amazing anime to watch!

"
                I would recommend this anime for anyone looking for a romantic one. I consider this a very original story line and equally original characters.  Tho sometimes it got a little bit slow i still was able to enjoy it quite much. Only regret as in most anime's is the ending, i wish they had been a little more story to the ending. Call me queer but i do love to endings that finish with a kiss :)  I hope they put some additional OVAs in there(even a new season)... maybe a little of what happens right next and then a little bit of
                  what happens in 3 - 10 years later.  if added ovas and they are a follow up to the original storyline where it got left i could rate the overall to 10.",9
"
                boy I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this one!
this anime is bad, there are roughly 3 character that are slightly interesting, Ami and Takasu and Taiga.
Kitamura and Minori are Boring as fuck, I couldn't care less about them and the show desperately wanted to make them relatable, Spoilers: They Failed!
at one point Kitamura goes full gay and dye his hair blonde! to make her crush to stay at school! Perfect Plan! after this master plan failed he tried Awkwardly to stop her from going by Begging her in front of everyone in a ceremony! also failed Big Surprise!! and he breaks through into
                  The MC's house! I mean what the hell is that!
and of course the star of the show! Kushieda Minori
she is the fakest person ever, she is fake to her friends she is fake to the audience and she is fake to herself! you can’t understand what the hell is it she wants, she desperately tries to show herself happy but secretly she is sad, this sounds like a character you usually root for right? Dead Wrong, her happy moments are SOO fake that it takes away everything with it, if she would appear normal in public i could root for her, because if you haven’t figured it out yet i love normal behaving people!
the comedy is really bad, Taiga hitting Takasu and calling him a Dog was funny the first couple of times then it's kinda... well not funny anymore
another problem is that Everyone is a Drama Queen! and confessions are so cheesy I wanna die! (except for Taiga and Takasu)
now let's take a look at Takasu, the main character:
you know people are usually looking for smart ways to get people to do their work for them, so they study psychology and shit to manipulate others, guess how Taiga Manipulates Takasu to make her works, clean her room, buy her stuff and cook for her? NO take a wild guess!
That's right! she calls him a dog and treats him like one WAIT she doesn't! Because you usually don't hit a dog! and yet he kept being with her, Poor Ami, she was right to call him a Baka! the funniest part is in one episode he concludes that it was HER who were near her all this time! i swear i’m losing it!!! BAKA! she is only around you because YOU are chasing her around!
and I don't think he understand that his mother is a prostitute otherwise he wouldn't be so indifferent about it!
*Spoilers
and of course the ending, they really tried to make us worry in episode 25 but we all knew it was bullshit and there is gonna be a happy ending, so Taiga suddenly choosing to transfer herself -(even though a day ago she was ready to leave everything and everyone behind)- didn't make any sense and just turned this anime more crappy
*Spoilers
oh in case I didn't mention there is a creepy seizure disordered bird! that was not cute at all, I don't know why it is there do begin with, it's like the joke is writing itself!
this is a long anime to be honest, I was watching it with 1.5x speed from episode 15 forward!
in conclusion, if you are not a huge fan of romance maybe this anime isn't the best choice right now save it for later.",3

Apparently heralded as one of if not the best romance anime out there, I thought I would give Toradora a go. After all, I had just finished Elfen Lied and was thoroughly craving some time-wasting mushy K-ON crap to get over the senseless emotional trauma of seeing mutilation and tits every episode. I managed to finally battle through to get tainting images of Dora the Explorer out of my mind by convincing myself that the stress was on the 'a' and not the 'o', and searched it up in Anilinkz.
Was I expecting something this mad that I would love? probably not.
Firstly, I found the humour in this fucking hilarious. I like an anime that doesn't take itself too seriously and taking the piss out of the design of the protagonist at the first mark was something different. But by far the most yuks came from that bloody parrot. I can't even keep a straight face thinking about 'special' Inko-chan. Toradora is also thankfully consistent in its comedy throughout the series often employing the godly randomness of Minori and 'The Teacher Who Never Wanted To Grow Up' to apply comic relief, of course also forgetting your usual dose of 'Tsunderity'.
Then there was the romance aspect to this. Of course there were no prizes from the start to what the pairings would be in the end. Now I don't think I'm really spoiling it for you as the title already beat me to it before you even begin. However, after watching plenty of KEY's predictable harems where you know straight away that the girl in the middle is the one he's going to get with, I wasn't too bothered. I guess I actually like the romantic inevitability. 
Oh wait, I remember now, I've decided I hate it. I'm going to stay clear of romance for a while because you spend the whole series wishing them to be together and when it's over you die inside realising that you'll never see those characters you bonded with and who bonded together ever again. You can go on and wish that they will make a second season of their happily ever after but you know if they did make the one that you want, it would be shit and would undoubtbly ruin the series.
Anyway, back on topic, this is a romance anime so its primary goal is to show the development of feelings between the two characters, and Toradora does so masterfully. Although it uses the old Tsundere cliche, I actually enjoyed the constant bullying of Ryuuji even though all he does is cook and look after Taiga, while she slowly opens up through the series which is great from a sexism point of view, even regarding the presence of fanservice. The romantic complications were interesting if not slightly annoyingly bitchy, but it all adds to the dynamics of story and builds the emotions up going towards the end.
Now in terms of intelligence, philosophy and underlining meaning which I always look for in my art, Toradora has a little, but enough to be somewhat satisfying. The series tells a strong story of rising above your environment and background with the help from our social relationships. The two main characters are both damaged people by their parents or the lack of thereof but they seem to complete each other; sorting out the others problems is what ties them together. 
Though perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this anime was its exploration of status in relationships. As Ami points out, role-playing 'house' as a father and a daughter is under no circumstances good grounds for a solid relationship- this could almost be interpreted as a critique of Japanese moe culture. Throughout the series, she insists to Ryuuji that he needs a relationship that is between equals (we can see where he went wrong though, he parents his own mother for god's sake). However, I like to think that status in relationships is a constantly changing factor; (admitting that there is an element of truth in that shite porn-background-music song of Prince about being a mother, a sister, a friend and a lover). This is definitely evident in the oscillating romance of our heroes. But we see the final transition with that ending, as the daughter finds her feet and in the ""father"" 's acceptance for them both to stand equal.
Also the surprise development of Yasuko was pretty cool as well. Gave her character more dimensions.
All in all, I really enjoyed this anime and would definitely recommend it to people who are a bit soppy deep down and to the 'real men' who cried at Clannad (me included).",8
"
                Toradora is a generic romcom anime, that had a lot of things going for it, but failed in terms of execution. It tells the story of a high school student named Takasu, who meets a young klutz named Aisaka Taiga, due to a embarrasing mistake, they cross paths, and vow to help each other out with their respective crushes. The execution for this anime, left a lot to be desired, the pacing was also really slow, like this shit took 15 episodes to get going, like come on. Let me tell you guys a brief story, I was losing interest in anime, when I started
                  watching Toradora, believing it to be the anime to replenish my thirst for the Japanese media, I endured watching it to the end, even tho it got me extremely bored, and it lessened my motivation of watching anime even more. Anime burnout is a serious thing, but luckily for me I found a better source material to replenish my thirst of anime. I went into Toradora initially expecting it to be a breath of fresh air, and boy was I wrong, very wrong. This show utilizes the stupidest plot devices, and a crap ton of these characters are bland stereotypes that you will see in every anime, like come on brah, especially some of these arc conclusions are hella shallow as well. Imma do the Pros and cons now, some of these points will be further elaborated there.
Pros:
-Good characterization [The main characters really lighten up the mood sometimes, most of the times they're boring, this all changes during the final 10 episodes tho]
- Decent soundtrack [Good enough, I can't say that I really bopped my head to this one tho]
-Kawashima Ami [Her character is really interesting and I fell like it would have been better if Takasu ended up with her]
-The comedy sometimes lightens up the mood a little bit [ which this anime really needs in order to not have the viewer snoozing while watching it]
[All right time to roast this anime]
Cons:
-Is extremely slow in terms of pacing, hella boring, they were times were I almost feel asleep, I legit forced myself to keep watching this shit most times, I had to tolerate 2 or more episodes of this shit every day, This shit is so bad that I legit did not watch any episodes of it, for like a week in order to be able to tolerate it even more. I experienced another case of anime burnout, due to this show as well.
-The conclusions to every emotional arc are so hollow, like I was just sitting there like that was it, you can't be fucking serious like that's it, that's how you resolve this problem, you legit just used an adlib to end a emotional arc an example of this is the Taiga's dad arc, like cmon who wrote this shit.
-The characters besides Kitamura, Takasu, Ami, and Kueshieda are unberable and extremely annoying to watch and bear , the same goes for Taiga, she is so damn childish, annoying, irritating and stupid at times that I wonder why she is the heroine of this show. These characters tho are just walking cardboards, annoying walking freaking cardboards.
-One more thing about the pacing that I forgot to mention is that, Why does this shit take way too fucking long to get going? Like not only does anime do this, this is a big issue in movies as well, the show takes way too long to get good without accomplishing anything ,there is not that much events happening during the first 14 episodes, what you're showing me looks like filler, honestly it would have been a lot more acceptable if these filler were actually good, fun and enjoyable, but no the first 14 episodes felt rushed, not enjoyable and frustrating to watch.
-The ending, now anyone with a brain is going to be able to predict that extremely predictable ending, this is also a case with the anime in general, you the viewer can easily predict what's going to happen next, and how these characters would act.
The ending, now anyone with a brain is going to be able to predict that extremely predictable ending, this is also a case with the anime in general, you the viewer can easily predict what's going to happen next, and how these characters would act. Now if used your brain and actually analyzed things then you had kept in mind that they were sideplots involving their parents, now obviously that would play a part later on the story right, well you guessed it it did, it played a part in the ending. After the ending I was sitting there like come on that was it, that was what I was anticipating the entire time, the reason why I watched this anime, that was it, talk about dissapointing.
-The final 10 episodes weren't even that great they were decent ,serviceable at best, it felt like it was lacking somehow, and for the final act knowing it failed and did not have that extra oommph that made a final arc of an anime good, just added up to my dissapointment.
-This anime really feels dated in our present time, like these character designs just don't do it anymore, remember how Ami used to the beautiful model that was supposed to be the face of beauty, well in our current time there any much more beautifully designed characters than her.
Overall Toradora is a generic romcom that failed at what it was trying to show and do, hence why it feels like a dissapointment for me, sure it has character development, decent main characters, but everything else surronding those just fall flat on their faces, and it's not enough to make the anime good. Now I would have given this anime a 5/10, but I came to the realization that 5/10 is for episodes 15 to 25. What about the first 15 episodes that were so bad, it woudn't be fair would it? That's why I decided to give Toradora a 4/10, since the first 15
episodes just really held this anime back for me, a 5/10 just isn't passible for a anime that was so boring and extremely predictable as a whole. I give Toradora a 4/10 based on my personal experience of it, and I really don't like it. After finishing this review, I felt comfy again, a huge weight was taken off my chest, and all that pain and suffering I experienced while enduring this anime just feels worth it since I was able to roast it. Btw this review is based off my personal opinion and enjoyment of the anime, [I really did not enjoy this anime, and I despise it] so don't attack me if I have a different opinion from you, and if you happen to love this anime, that's completely fine, different people have different opinions at the end of the day, just don't be an asshole about it.",4
"
                I am the person who really loves romance. I watch the whole series in just a day because it was really good, wherein you don't want to miss an episode. To start off, I love the anime as it portrays the reality of life and also the characters itself. This anime starts off slow, but as it progress it gets really good. 
The overall story is really good. It showed us the ups and downs of love including love with family. There's no more anime the same as this, but there are more anime that has similarity in terms of the characters and enjoyment. But
                  the story is pure. Best Comedy/Romance that I watch.  A  MUST WATCH ANIME!",9
"
                If your a long-time reader of my anime reviews then you have heard this expression before. I'm a sucker for the romantic, slice of life animes and Toradora is certainly one of them.
Honestly, Toradora is a lovable anime but while watching this it does make you mad at times. Considering, the characters just don't have the courage at times to stand up and show where their loyalties lie and who their true love is but that's mainly to the end of the series.
This was a really fun and enjoyable anime to watch and is indeed up there with some of the others, but first, lemme
                  do my usual and break it down and share my own thoughts and opinions about why I have given this anime a 9/10
First and foremost, let's kick off with the;
Story - 8/10
Alright, the story about Toradora is a really sweet one showing us a simple school life between one Takasu, Ryuji, and Aisaka, Taiga.
Takasu is a single teen who lives with his mother and goes to school like every other 16-17 year old would do in his day-to-day life.
He is fairly mature of his age, always cleans up after himself and if he was see something dirty or was tasked to clean something, he would clean it with proper muscle power. In contrast, however, he has an intimidating face that often gets him labeled as a delinquent.
Then we are introduced to a cute petite girl, Aisaka, Taiga, but don't be fooled, she isn't at all sunshine and rainbows. She owns a wooden katana which I have no idea why maybe for self-defense? However, she has a fiery personality and it would take someone with guts and determination to woo her over. Throughout the school she attends along with Takasu, Ryuji, she is known as the ""Palmtop Tiger"".
As the story goes on, we pick up that Aisaka has a rich family and she was moved to this apartment building over personal family issues between her and her mother and father. She lives off pot noodles as it was described in the anime and doesn't clean up after herself. This lifestyle is completely different from Takasu, Ryuji, a simple guy who cleans up and cooks for himself, along with his mother who is a waitress at a nightclub but it's hard to keep track of what she actually does since throughout the series she has multiple jobs.
Anyway, both Takasu, Ryuji, and Aisaka, Taiga form some sort of vain friendship and eventually then show who they truly have a crush on. Taiga falls for and shows strong emotion towards Kitamura, Yuusaku who of course is Ryuji's best friend, then in a plot twist, Ryuji falls for and has strong emotions towards Kushieda, Minori who is (you guessed it) Taiga's best friend.
Both Ryuji and Taiga create a pact of sorts, where they will try and help each other to get close to their crush and hopefully start a relationship with their crush.
This at times doesn't always go to plan and you would need to watch the anime to understand what I'm trying to get at here, don't wanna put too many spoilers in here.
All I can say though, it doesn't always go to plan, and later on during the series, we eventually realize that those crushes were just fantasy's. We are eventually shown who Ryuji and Taiga truly love.
Art - 9/10
No question in my mind, the art was beautifully done but I have yet to watch an anime where I would think the art was utter crap.
It's difficult to talk about this subject since all anime art is professionally done and I know there is gonna be times where the art is cute, adorable, and beautiful but then the story is just bad, so bad, that I might have to drop it, not something I want to do.
Toradora's art was fantastically done.
Sound - 7/10
Eh, the sound wasn't the best I felt. To have an impactful anime you need to have some powerful music to go along with it. In some scenes, there was crying with gentle music in the background but it didn't make me feel sad or make me show emotions towards the characters, it just was a scene with the characters showing emotions, and that I was just sitting there watching it.
There are certain animes out there that have music for each character when they are on screen. Having character-specific soundtracks playing in the background when that character on screen, allows us, the viewer to connect with that character and if it's done right, the sad crying scenes would have an impact.
Character - 9/10
The character design was certainly top-notch. Watching the characters talking with others allowed me to connect well with the anime and I enjoyed watching them go through school life while having interesting adventures in-between.
I thoroughly enjoyed watching the characters going through their day-to-day tasks and it made me feel happy and contempt when watching Toradora.
Enjoyment - 8/10
I very much enjoyed Toradora, it was a truly lovely anime to watch before bedtime and I would recommend this to anyone who has the same love for romance, drama, and slice of life animes. You won't be disappointed but everyone is entitled to their own opinion and you don't always have to agree with mine, this is just my thoughts.
Overall - 9/10
Toradora was a fantastic anime and I would like to thank those who recommended it to me. I thoroughly loved watching it and would love to watch it again but I'm not overly crazy for Toradora. Some people who say it was alright, whereas me, I would say it was not alright, but not brilliant, somewhere in between, unsure what word to use here.
Anyway, if you have this in your planned to watch, don't hold back and give it a try, you might be surprised.
Anyway, that's essentially all that I have to say about ""Toradora!""
I hope you enjoyed reading this review.
Thanks for reading!

"
                I don't know how long an animé review should be but I'll try to keep it short and sweet just like Tora dora! 
The action is based around 17 year old high school students confronting real life teenage problems like friendship, love, relationship with parents, school life, thinking about the future. 
Although it is still fictional, this is the most realistic animé I've ever seen by now.
The characters are pretty stereotypical for a teenage TV show: the hot, popular girl, the geek etc 
Although the show is pretty joyful there are a few key moments that express the fact that life isn't easy, such as
                  the representation of the relationship between Tiger and her father. 
The line that marked me the most was said during the 18th episode, addressed to Takasu : "" At the end of the day, the person you understand the least is yourself"" . I felt like I was enlightened when I heard this because during the day, when I'm surrounded by people, I try to understand each and everyone of them because I believe that everything has a reason behind it but  often times when I'm all by myself I don't get why I do/say/feel certain things. 
Overall, the message that Tora dora gives is that no matter how hard things might be, in the end true love is the one that wins and every single effort counts!",10
"
                At first glance when I saw Toradora, I did not expect anything much. I wasn't interested in rom-com at that time so my expectations were just a show that can fill my time up, whether if it's interesting or not. The moment the play button was pressed, I fell in love with this show. 
The 5 main characters were unique in their own way, bringing out the friendship pointer. Despite being so different, they were still able to interact just fine, the comedy just makes their friendship way more polished.
The story was simple & basic, with the combination of the characters & comedy though, brought
                  one heck of a show. Toradora isn't just now a typical rom-com series, but a show unique to itself.",8
"
                This anime is (for me) amazing. I really enjoy school animes and all but this one is just pure awesomeness!! If u like school, romance and comedy then this definatly the anime to watch.
Story: well there has been many school anime like this (ex: lovely complex) but  this anime still has a nice story. A girl whos feared by the kids of her meets up with a guy who's also feared cause his dad was a delinquent or something both like each others bestfriend and try help one another with their crush. This story started of slowly but it gets really gd.
Art: the characters
                  are well drawn nd look gd. 
Sound: I liked  the opening and ending alot. This is probably one of the anime which I wouldn't skip the op and end cause they are really nice. 
Character: The characters are very likable nd entertaining.  I really liked Minori (user name XD) I usually dnt like girls from animes (except Haruhi, I mainly claim a guy) but her cheerfulness made me admire her so much. she also reminds me of myself a complete air-head but is still very understanding. other than that the characters are very enjoyable.
Enjoyment: I am really enjoying this anime. Its got lots of hilarious parts and some sad parts but still I truly enjoyed this anime nd would defiantly re watch sometime later. Like I said it was boring in the beginning I was like O_o Taiga is so short nd why is she treating him so meanly i have to admit I didn't really like it, but when the bond between Taiga and Takasu grew I instantly fell in love with it.
Overall: 10! 10! defiantly a 10 this is an anime that I consider one of my favs so it deserves a 10!! XD",10
"
                This is my first review, and a very negative one. This anime is bad, and you should NOT recommend it to newcomers and let them expect a quality show. Otherwise they will be forever turned away from the slice of life genre, which I believe is a sad thing. Also spoiler warning. Also, keep in mind that the last episode has a post-credits scene that was often overlooked and made many people unhappy with the ending.  
Story: The main focus of this story is romance. Fine. Picture this: a girl decides to help a guy get the girlfriend of his dreams (or so he
                  thinks) but as she spends time with him she realizes that she is actually in love with him. That's it. The whole story. It is incredibly predictable, and probably a cliche of classical literature as well. But an even bigger concern for me is how much this is all dramatized in the final episodes: running away from their parents even though there is no such necessity, then coming back because... because why exactly? Actually, spontaneous changes of decision seem to be a common character trait in this anime, as you will see later.  
In my opinion the story would be much more interesting and less cliche if the mc had ended up with Kawashima (the blue-haired photo model) since Taiga is more like a sister to Takasu than a wife, and Kawashima is overall a better match.  
Characters: I am ready to accept that, as a Canadian university student, I might not fully understand a Japanese highschooler, but some things in this show are just not human. You would think that the characters come from Mars and only look like humans, but don't share any emotional or rational characteristics with us.  
1-Takasu Ryuuji (main character): Not as badly written as most other characters, but has flaws that make it impossible to identify with him at all. Some decisions he makes make no sense, like ""withholding the truth about him and Taiga from Kushieda in the mountain trip arc"" or ""trying to convince GreenHairWithGlasses to go on a date with Taiga at least once"", which would have simplified the situation for everyone. Other decisions he made downright hurt people, like ""lying about who saved Taiga on the mountain and what she muttered about liking Takasu"". Seriously man, what were you trying to achieve there? Are you denying the truth from yourself or trying to make things even more difficult for poor Taiga? Yes I am criticizing this character harshly, but it is nothing compared to what you will read next.  
2-Kawashima Ami (best girl): Honestly the light of this show. She is the only reason why I put a 3 instead of a 1 for this otherwise dreadfully stupid anime. Kawashima is the only character that feels ""human"" in this show: she has a love interest yet does not act all blushy and unable to tie words together when talking to him, she has her issues in life yet is not defined only by them, and overall her character cannot be summed up in a few words, unlike ""short girl with no social skills"" or ""overly optimistic sports enthusiast"" or ""overly optimistic vice-president"". Overall, I wonder what such a great and complex character is doing in such a bland and uninteresting show.  
3-Kitamura Yusaku/Maruo (vice-president, Takasu's ""best friend"" although it is not so apparent): The worst character. Insensitive asshole. Crybaby, undecisive, stupid. Slice of life stories usually don't have a ""villain"" but Kitamura may be just that. Where do I start with all the flaws of this character? Ok so he has cobfessed to Taiga once and she refused out of fear. Then we learn that RIGHT AFTER the confession, he meets the Student Council Dictator who tells him, ""oh don't worry, this is just a high school life experience after all"" and less than a year later Kitamura not only forgets about Taiga, but also falls so madly in love with the Dictator that he would be ready to follow her around the world. All ends in a public confession of love that is everything but dramatically satisfying. Boy, you are the vice-president and you know very well that Dictator would not look at you weird for the rest of the year or anything if you had confessed to her normally, and you also know that Taiga likes you, so why did you have to wait until Dictator's last day and make a mess out of the story? Are you an idiot, or an insensitive prick? Both, probably. Speaking of his relationship with Taiga: he tells her that he only wants to be friends. I am ready to suspend my disbelief and buy into the ""falling out of love in less than a year"" thing (even though that never happens with actual humans, proving that Kitamura is from Jupiter or something), but in the whole first half of the show he acts all cool around Taiga even though she can barely piece words together, and also dares ask her for favours with a straight face, pretending that both confessions had never ever happened. Kitamura is either being dumb, playing dumb, or just an asshole messing with Taiga's feelings, which makes him an apalling character design for a SoL ""comedy"" anime either way.
4-Kushieda Minori (overly optimistic sports enthusiast): you will notice that I reused her description from two paragraphs ago because that's literally what she is. No character decelopment, no emotional revelation about her past, nothing. A cardboard cutout. Oh, she does have that moment where Kawashima whispers something to her about ""guilt for a certain someone"" which is restated in the mountain trip arc but never really explained. I could use my head now as I always do and analyze/interpret that, but I am too tired. If that is the only ""deep"" point of the show, it is not enough to make up for Toradora's pitiful excuse of a storyline.  
5-Aisaka Taiga (the tsundere): This one is all right except for the fact that no one in real life actually acts like that. I have liked people in a romantic way before, and I can confirm that no, you do not get Asperger's syndrome every time you are close to them or every time they touch you. But hey, tsundere gotta be tsundere I guess. Oh also, remember how I said that a person cannot completely change your love interest in a year like Kitamura did? Well, Taiga manages to do the same exact thing, which is blatant reuse of a character trait that was flawed in the first place. Pathetic.  
Sounds, art, etc: I don't usually pay attention to sounds, and all drawing styles are fine as long as it is consistent with the story, so... nothing to say.  
Enjoyment: I will quote Taiga on ""Nothing ever goes the way I want it to."" The beginning was fine actually, from the first five episodes I thought to give it an 8. Then a 7. Then a 5. As the story progressed it got more and more painful to watch and the only thing that prevented me from stopping was my curiosity to know how far my disappointment could get. And the answer is very.  
Overall: 2.5-3/10. Terrible show, not the worst that I have ever watched but pretty close.",3
"
                Watch Toradora if you want to waste your time. I'm really sorry but I did not like it at all. I was jumping in with the impression that it was a good romcom (even a friend recommended it to me) so I was looking for a well developed romance, and already kind of felt these characters were the type to have a very strong bond. I'm really into that so I was excited! But no...I guess the writing is to blame for what a letdown this anime was. I genuinely can't understand how people can give this a good rating, I dont know if it
                  was the hype when it came out, or the age range of who watches it or what. I'm a 24 year old female who is a sucker for romance anime. I love seeing characters slowly build their relationship with some good story writing. Romance anime usually at least feels a little sentimental, or fun to watch even if the writing isn't that good. But...sigh.
The biggest problem here was the female lead. I love assertive/dominant girl characters, but she was just straight up abusive. And not even in a ""cute tsundere"" way. Was all the times she hit him supposed to be comedy? Are people supposed to dismiss it because she's a short anime girl? I feel like this type of trope could still work, only if she was written better. She's just straight up a bad person. I'd fight her with my bare fists, if I swung low enough *maybe* I would land a hit. Here's why she's a terrible character, or is at least introduced badly.
[Spoilers]
First episode in she harasses the male lead, and then BREAKS INTO HIS FREAKING HOUSE AND TRIES TO BEAT HIM. WHAT THE? Also why wasn't he scared for his f*cking life realizing someone broke in, and is now swinging at him? This man is cursed to never react to anything at all. At any other times she abuses him, he doesn't have a reaction, he doesn't get mad at her, he doesn't tell her to stop treating him like shit. And what's worse...he does SO much for her. He cleaned her place, and continues to cook for her. Everyday!!!! She doesn't even say thank you!! (she can in a some tsundere way!) She goes around continuing to be AN ANGRY CHILD, even to other characters. It's...it's not even cute at this point. I was gonna look past this single character trait she had until the show displayed some kind of redeeming quality for her. But no, she just continued to mooch off Ryuji (male lead) as he continues to not bat an eye to her abuse. She can be a tsundere. As long as there are moments where that ""wall"" is broken down and shows she's actually human, and actually likes his company and the effort he puts into her.
 If she was a real person, I honestly can't understand who would even like being around her. She's angry and has child-like levels of impulsive, and extremely spoiled with getting her way. Like I said, I literally love assertive female characters, but only if Taiga was actually a decent human being. She doesn't even treat Ryuji like a person, he at least deserves that for the effort he puts into improving her life.
Another gripe I have with the anime, is obviously no one reacts like how they kind of should react. Ryuji, of course, is the biggest offender. Would you make food and care for someone who constantly hits and insults you? No? Just me? Another part is...there are times he's around his crush, left alone. This boy literally fantasizes about making wholesome memories with this woman, she's the light of his life (at this moment), yet he's not nervous. He's not trying to strike up a conversation with her or get to know her. He. has. no. reaction. Yes there are parts he blushes if she's in the conversation/etc, but why isn't he nervous if he's left alone with her? Why isn't he trying to get to know her? Why isn't he acting like a normal person? WHY DID THIS ANIME USE THE LOCKED UP TOGETHER TROPE IF NOTHING HAPPENED?? 
You know what, I''m sure the reason is the creator didn't bother trying to make it believable since Ryuji and Taiga were planned to get together. These characters don't act like high schoolers at all. Or maybe it's better written in the manga, idk.
But what am I expecting out of an anime? At least some human f*cking connection, in a romance anime, no less. Taiga's an asshole and needs get off her high chair. Ryuji needs to actually put his energy into someone that's actually cares about him. Like I said, you can keep the tsundere/aggressive trope, if she actually showed hints of her real self, or hints of actually caring for Ryuji. 
Anyway, when it comes to romance anime, if I end up disliking anyone, it's usually a male character (usually the cold, mean type), but this is the FIRST time I've disliked the female character, and an assertive one at that. I actually thought I was going to dislike the male character. But, I really grew to like Ryuji, he's a good guy that's misunderstood (I guess that only mattered in the first episode though -_-), who helps people out who he thinks deserve the help (uh, well...maybe he missed the mark with Taiga there though...). I love male characters that choose to cook, clean, etc, and just an overall wholesome dude who's in love and shows it! That's really rare! But he's wasted in this anime.
TLDR; Female lead is a terrible person, but her bad actions are somehow dismissed and not confronted, yet the male lead continues to help her. The male lead has good traits himself, but he's basically babysitting and caring for this angry child of a female lead. 
It's like the anime grabbed some tropes to run with, but ended up tripping at the start of the race, then walked off its own direction dragging the tropes on the ground. I really wish it was written better.",1
"
                WARNING: Spoilers 
To sum it up: it's mid. 
Plot: 3/10 
One of the first things we learn in this show is that our main character, Ryuuji, has a 'scary face' that leads people to be afraid of him; however, I can't describe his face with anything other than synonyms of boring. This is a plot point that is randomly thrown in throughout the show, and just when it seems like everybody has gotten used to his very bland appearance suddenly he narrows his eyes a bit and he's 'scary' again. I couldn't help but feel like while I was watching the show nothing was actually
                  progressing, I get that this can be normal for slice of life but with the romance aspect integrated I'd expect it to be at least romantically progressing at the halfway mark - for me personally, it just didn't feel like anything was happening until the end of the series. All I'm going to say is Ryuuji summed up the plot perfectly himself - 'different day, same old story'. 
Characters: 3/10 
One of my biggest pet peeves of this show is the characters. Only a couple are decent, and even then they're nothing special. Taiga is perhaps one of the most obnoxious characters I've ever had the displeasure of watching - and I enjoy tsundere character-types, Taiga is not a tsundere, she's just a bitch. Taiga and Ryuuji's early dynamic might have been slightly interesting if Taiga wasn't designed so poorly. The character that Taiga initially is crushing on (vice president boy, so boring I've forgotten his name) is one of the most forgettable characters  ever, Ami is yet again just another bitch purely put into the show to butt heads with Taiga and make Taiga look not as bad (doesn't work very well). Ryuuji is also boring but he at least shows  slight development throughout the show, though nothing impressive especially considering the series is twenty-five episodes and he's supposed to be the main character. Minori is probably the only character I enjoyed, she genuinely had her own spunk and interesting qualities about her and quite honestly it's a damn shame that Ryuuji chose Taiga over her - honestly, just felt like at that point in the story he'd take whatever he could get (I mean this guy really gave up on the girl he'd been simping over for the physical and mental embodiment of a child... Kinda weird but okay). Any other characters were honestly so underdeveloped or boring that I don't feel the need to comment on them. Mostly, the characters are very one dimensional. 
Animation: 4/10 
At points the animation is actually quite nice to look at, it's nothing special, it's nothing terrible. However, like I previously mentioned with the main character Ryuuji, if they actually wanted to drive home the 'scary face' plot point they could have just animated his face to be, well...  Scary. As well as this, a smaller pet peeve is that whenever anything went a bit faster in the show (characters fighting, running, things of that nature) the animation would absolutely bomb and look terrible - though, I suppose that's not crazy for the time it was made.
The Ending: 2/10
The ending was unsatisfying, it was boring and quite frankly it was lazy. It didn't feel thought out whatsoever and almost felt like a slap in the face, calling me stupid for bothering to sift through twenty-five episodes of this mid-tier anime for a less than mid ending. Meh.",4
"
                I sincerely have no idea why Toradora is so popular.
The story is pretty much just a regular highschool love story, it's generic and boring.
Even tho I usually have no enjoyment on watching romantic series, I can accept the ones that become popular because they're good and/or they have unique plots, but Toradora is just the same I've seen in all other regular shoujo animes.
The art and animation are fine, just what we could expect from a regular anime. Toradora is not totally a waste of time, I mean, you can probably enjoy one episode or two.
If you like generic shoujos and tsunderes, then go ahead
                  and have fun, but if you're expecting something new and exciting, just give up already.",6
"
                Toradora was one of those animes I disliked for no apparent reason.  I did not know if it was the artwork, the concepts, or the hype around it.  Without watching it, I just did not like this romcom just because it was Toradora.  Eventually, I realized I had to watch this.  I felt that its completion would make me a more well-rounded anime fan.  After watching Toradora, I do not what to say.  I have added it to my list of animes that have made me cry.
Toradora is primarily slice of life.  With this in mind, do not
                  start this anime with a mindset of heavy action, intensity, and mind-boggling plot twists.  Normally, slice of life, as a genre, is more mundane than other types of anime.  This does not mean that it is boring by any means.  The events are simply more akin to what may happen in our own lives.  In Toradora, I have found the plot to be very engaging.  It has some of the school slice of life arcs such as festivals and beaches, but I felt that Toradora did those parts distinctly better than other animes.  
I thought about why I enjoyed this anime more than other of its genre.  I then realized that the cast was the difference.  Toradora has amazing characters.  The three main girls (Taiga, Ami, and Minori) are all very detailed and have distinct and unique personalities.  Personally, I felt that Taiga carried the show.  Her character is heartwarming, sad, funny, and adorable.  Ryuji, the protagonist, is very solid as well.  
Art and sound are both great.  The art is very well done in the right moments and scenes, although, it may fall off a little in a small portion of more mundane screen time.  The sound is average at the beginning.  By the second half, some viewers may notice a certain emotionally powerful song in the OST (Lost My Pieces).  This song is breathtaking.  It has drove me to tears by simply listening to it.  The track has completely revolutionized my score for sound.  The OPs and EDs are pretty good.
When it comes to enjoyment, Toradora has performed great.  At the end of the anime, I was reaching a difficult decision between giving it a 9 or a 10.  I thought that the anime was excellent.  However, I thought that there could be some flaws to it.  Some anime watchers may have trouble with Taiga.  Others may dislike the melodrama and how over the top everything seems later.  That was when one of the themes of Toradora hit me.
*Possible spoilers* The theme of society's influence on an individual and truly knowing someone coincided with how I was deciding and it is present in Toradora.  I always felt that I was a special snowflake, that I was free of society's molds.  However, how I was giving Toradora's score was evident of how other viewers may think and not my personal opinion.  *Possible spoilers done*
That is what has changed my opinion.  At the end of an anime, what truly matters is enjoyment.  Looking back at it, I love Toradora.  It is an emotional roller coaster and now I understand why some people say that it has defind the romantic comedy genre.  It feels like Taiga is the pioneer of the tsundere archetype.  Surely, there may be some flaws in Toradora, but none have bothered me enough to even bring this masterpiece to a 9.  The pros about the anime are simply too high.  The characters, the feels, the soundtrack, the story.  All of it is done at a high level that I would not expect from a slice of life, romcom anime.  That is why I am sticking with a 10.
In conclusion, here are a few of some questions you should ask yourself if you want to recommend this anime to yourself.
-Do you like tsunderes?
-Do you like feels/melodrama?
-Do you like a high school/slice of life setting at all?
-Finally, do you like a romance that is not all rainbows and sunshine?
If yes to any of these questions, watch Toradora now.  
Overall: 9.5/10",10
"
                Toradora! As an avid anime watcher who especially enjoys lighthearted romances, I was surprised to have discovered that I skipped out on one of the most popular romcoms out there. The general plot of Toradora is nothing new; the MC has a crush but gradually realizes his love for another girl (not really a spoiler, since the title makes everything quite obvious for anyone who's watched anime before). So why bother watching an anime with such a generic story, especially one where you know how it'll likely end up? It boils down to the comfortable pacing and length of the anime that allows the hilarity
                  and seriousness of a typical romance to dovetail into a near perfect experience. Unlike many romance animes, Toradora lacks the overdramatized moments in which forced tears and exaggerated life issues would deceive viewers into mistaking rather saccharine plot devices with genuine tragedies. Instead, Toradora thrives on the relatable nature of the couple, as both MC's sincerely commit themselves to chasing their love interests, allowing for further events to unfold both realistically and in a timely fashion. With that said, this anime is not without its flaws. Perhaps it is my own fault for being too absorbed by certain characters, but as one who watches the anime will find out, not all the main/supporting characters were developed to their fullest extent. Furthermore, the naivety of young love is quite prevalent in the closing episodes. However, it's arguable that Tatsuyuki's intention was to keep the fan-coveted analytical evaluations of those characters to a minimum, in order to avoid dreary monologues and bring focus to what the anime shines for: an admirable love gradually developing between two friends who are always there for each other. 
Highly recommend, especially if you enjoy cute stories. 8.5/10",9
"
                I thought OreImo had taken the cake for how much rage I could feel during an anime. Turns out I was wrong. Toradora is the single most infuriating experience I've ever had.
I would write an objective review but I simply can't write this without including the sheer pain I felt watching this atrocity. If you want some more objective stuff, skip to the next point down. I have kept this review spoiler free.
• The Definition of Insanity
I hate this show. I despise it. It went from generic, to boring, to anticlimactic all the while keeping me infuriated. And it left me with a lingering feeling
                  of hopelessness, confusion and still anger. And yet I watched the whole thing. And yet I enjoyed the story in a twisted way. My entire essence of being is bamboozled.
So, let's get this out of the way first. Don't like tsundere? Please God do not make the same mistake I did. Skip. This. Anime. The MC is a doormat for most of it, though better than some, and main-side character, Taiga, is full on tsundere.
The first few episodes set up the premise, doing so in a way that made me think, eh why not let's see how this goes. But I should have seen the signs and just stopped there before I went so far down the rabbit hole I felt I had to reach the bottom.
Instead, I suffered through a good 10 episodes at least of constant tsundere that made me want to claw my eyes out, and yet I still kept on watching. There's not much to say, any memory of the plot stored in my brain had been fused out by the rage I felt. It was lots of school stuff and relationships and backstory and was painfully slow and boring. I suppose I have to admit it did acceptably story-wise, though characters acted infuriatingly at times. I suppose that comes with the genre.
After getting through the middle of the show, things start heating up. Plot points everywhere, drama drama drama. Also tsundere, I don't think I mentioned that yet. On the bright side, Taiga warms a bit as the show goes on, like any not-trash tsundere should. Not that any tsundere is ever not trash. We have multiple characters that could be romance interests, attempts at hooking up, lots of exploring why that isn't happening, that kind of thing. Honestly the plot here drew me in, helped by the fact that Taiga was toned down. 
The ending was... weird. I felt like it was trying to teach me a life lesson, but all it succeeded in doing was make me yell at my monitor that I would give the show one star if it went where I thought it would. It didn't, but the ending episode is pretty much a huge plot twist moment made, I hypothesize, precisely to infuriate me, specifically. Just a little bit more blood pressure after 24 other episodes of pure vain bursting. Then, in the last 30 seconds it diverts the plot twist and gives a really odd ending that left me... I don't know. It was... an ending? It wasn't really satisfactory but I don't know what to say is wrong about it.
• Actual Thoughts
Honestly the story was... Really good, I think. I had to struggle through so much stuff I hated, and yet I actually was entertained beneath the red haze. As I mentioned, the ending was extremely odd, but otherwise I'd say for a school drama it succeeds in its goals well. Though characters did act odd a couple of times. It explored the characters and the situations in ways that kept me intrigued, and the overall story arc was good.
Characters had depth to them, and seemed to act sensibly to their personalities throughout. Seeing each character's story unfold was legitimately interesting to see.
There were some genuinely good moments in this show too, and while I wouldn't consider it a comedy, I laughed about two times during the show. They were good, hearty laughs so they count for a lot more.
Sound and animation was fine. I was too distracted to notice sound but the animation was on par or better.
• In Closing
I can't fault anything about this show really... I hated every second, and yet... I would probably still recommend it to anyone who likes tsunderes. I enjoyed it, though some of that may be because I sometimes like watching stuff that makes me want to invert my body violently. If it had been less tsundere, had fewer silly character decisions and less cringe than I think I would have really enjoyed it fully.
Overall... a very spiteful, disgusted, 8 out of 10. I hated it. It's not as though I enjoyed it or anything, hmph, whatever... baka.",8
"
                On a personal note, I loved Toradora. When a story can develop likable characters and then make me laugh and cry throughout the series, then of course Id be sold. 
But to be unbiased, The story was very well put together, a full 25 episodes gave it enough time for each character to be better developed, and it also took away the abrupt ending that comes with most animes that are the usual 12 episodes. But to get into specifics, the characters grow on you through the entire series. at episodes 12 and beyond, it becomes apparent where the love connection is. When Taiga cries
                  for her Ryuuji, you might finding yourself tearing up or going ""Awww"" with the utmost sincerity. And Ryuuji is just as likable. Unfortunately, towards the end you start to disagree with alot of the character actions and will most likely end up a little irritated. The ending wasn't amazing but it was satisfying. It left you with a few questions floating around, but I haven't seen many animes with all the plot holes filled. All in all, Toradora is a great anime and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a slice-of-life, comedy, and romance preference.",9
"
                Very cute anime. Good character plot. It almost relates to me. The plot twist was also good. 
This is probably one of the best Romance anime I have watched. Since the characters in the plot is so relatable, I would wish there is a continuation for this series. 
To be honest, Taiga is actually cute! The first time when Ryuuji met Taiga is actually one of my favourite scenes with her. Oh, I wish I could see more scenes of her and her friends! 
The Comedy between the Romance is funny and cool.
Hope you have a good time watching! :)*Hope I didn't spoil anything lol",9
"
                I think this is one of the good animes that has the daily life based events that are occuring. There can be many events about love in high school life. A lot of people fall in love during their high school years. This anime shows those events where one cant handle love. It is an addicting anime once you keep looking at it. And it is really unique that Toradora sets things that happen in daily bases.
I think this anime particularly shows the meaning of friendship in our lives. Without friendship and encouragements, things dont work out properly and stuff. The characters are really suited
                  for their personalities and its quite unique on how they did the things. Taiga Aisaka for example, her appearance is small and yet she has the palm of a tiger (what ppl call in the story). Her recognition by others in the anime as a tiger suits the name Taiga. 
The anime shows comedic situations in various ways which makes it a good anime to watch.",8
"
                Is what you want, what you truly want?
Story- 8/10 
The story is about our two main characters and their experience with the emotion called, ""love."" Taiga and Ryuuji have a crush on each others best friends and work together to get to hook each other up. Seems simple enough right? Well, it is. It's quite obvious who is going to end up with whom, but the charm of the show is in the adventure and how they get there, not in the destination.
The pacing is a little slow at times with some episodes seeming a little longer than others, while other parts had the pacing
                  feel a little fast (the ending).
Art- 9/10
The art fit very well and the atmosphere it was able to create at times were almost breathtaking. 
Sound- 8/10
Nothing too memorable music wise, the voice actors though, were very good. Taiga being voiced by Kugimiya, Rie a voice actress known as the ""Queen of Tsundere."" The voice actors fit the cast well and were able to clearly portray the emotion of the characters throughout the course of the series.
Character- 10/10
Toradora has characters that are relatable and act somewhat realistically. The two main characters are both outcasts and really only have one friend, making them a bit socially awkward, especially when it comes to love. With their lack of experience, they make many mistakes and have some very funny moments along the way. 
The other main/supporting characters (Ami, Yuusaku, and Minori) have their own dilemmas within the story, often putting up a facade or doing things that contradict how they feel. Just like the two leads they all develop in their own ways and come to their own conclusions. 
The real supporting cast is okay, but nothing too memorable like the main characters.
The ones that do stand out are Ryuuji's mother and Taiga's father, even though they don't change, they play their own little parts in the story and further development of the other characters.
Enjoyment- 9/10
I think many other people will find enjoyment in this anime, with its many laughs good characters, and sweet romance.
Overall- 9/10 
It's a must watch for those who are interested in romance or are trying to get into the genre. It has very little flaws and an overall good pacing.",9
"
                I will put it simply...
Toradora! is a cliff hanger for the heart. It truly captures how you might fall in love in high school and the stupidity that comes with it xD
Every single episode (except for 2 or 3) makes want to know what will happen to the main characters and their relationship...that way it keeps glued to your seat till you end watching every single episode. 
              ",10
"
                Toradora, like Blue Exorcist, is a masterpiece not so much total originality as of execution. The characters and tropes used in the show are nothing surprising, but they are timed and wielded with such deftness and deepness that the show becomes poignant and enjoyable beyond all expectations. 
Along with very polished animation and robust voice acting, characterization is absurdly great: the main duo has real chemistry, and the supporting cast is all appealing and interesting. The humor is fabulous, a combination of gentle slapstick and clever writing. And despite all its silly genre foibles, by the finale, Toradora feels like it takes place very much
                  in the real world, with all the consequences and outcomes involved in being a part of real life.
At the very least, Toradora is worth the three-episode test.",10
"
                Tsundere - we know the drill. Love grows from animosity. Yet in Toradora, the plot wasn't that simple. Not in the slightest. Toradora is a delightful anime that will make you laugh, but it will also strike a cord deep within you.
Story - 9
As stated, this isn't a straightforward tsundere, at least in my opinion. This anime doesn't make things that easy. Taiga is a tough tsundere-girl to crack, to say the least, and one shouldn't expect to see her feelings change that easily. In fact, where I think this show excels, is the recurring theme that Ryūji and Taiga's deepest, darkest desires are buried
                  deep by themselves. And so these desires they bury so fervently aren't going to be made readily available to us as the audience. I won't delve more into this theme so as not to provide spoilers, but one should realise it is highly prevalent throughout the anime. As stated by one character, ""The person you understand the least is yourself."" So true for so many of us.
Another theme that the story of Toradora really excels at, is the theme of running away from one's problems. We all do it. We all ignore our problems. But sometimes we need to face them head on.
Clearly, Toradora is not just comedy and romance fluff. It deals with serious issues; estranged family members, what a family truly is (blood-related or ""adopted""), growing up, and all it's disappointments, as well as what it means to be a mature adult. I really appreciated this spin on the romantic comedy genre.
And my absolute favourite lesson learned? We cannot grow as a person without love (aww :P).
The ending...without saying much, I wasn't initially very pleased with it. I thought it ended up being a little bit overly cruel to our main protagonist. And a bit futile. But yet again, I laughed as a realised that Toradora really had kept me guessing - right up until the end! Oh, and make sure to watch right through the credits - there is a wonderful little tsundere moment to end things off :P. 
Art - 10
I adored the art. Really could find nothing wrong with it in the slightest. Taiga is absolutely adorable. And all the characters are illustrated in the vibrant, clean way.
Sound - 10
Another great feature of Toradora is it's soundtrack. I was disappointed with a minority of tracks that seemed to repeat themselves, yet there were stellar tracks that just outshone my disappointment. The first theme song - Pre-Parade - was absolutely phenomenal as it fitted the anime so well.  And watching Taiga glare into the camera during the introduction; priceless. Silky Love - the later introductory theme song during the second half of the series - was also great as it showed Taiga's development as a character, and the change between Taiga's and Ryūji's relationship. Vanilla Salt is also a great song! But without further specifics, songs and scores used during particularly emotional moments in the anime really overwhelmed me.
Character - 9
The characters shone for me; it wasn't a job done solely by Taiga and Ryūji. One particular favourite was Yasuko, Ryūji's mother. I first saw her and through that it was a girlfriend of Ryūji's. Her personality was so well-written and humourous, I just was enamoured. One character that I personally could not relate to was Minori. I found her attitude fake and annoying at best. And later in the anime, without giving spoilers, I felt her behaviour was just unfounded and poorly written, and contraindicated her role as a friend. Other than that though, no complaints! Even other supporting characters like Inko-Chan were wonderful and added flavor to the world of Toradora.
Enjoyment - 10
Not much to say here, except that I was dying to watch a new episode every time I finished a previous one. The fact that I felt I could relate to Taiga almost instantly really helped matters. Relate-ability - that is what truly made Toradora what it was and is.
Overall - 10
This is a 10/10 anime for me, even with a few faults. This anime was nothing short of magical and endearing. I feel as though I was sucked into the anime, and that I myself was friends with the whole group of friends in the anime. It is sad that the show ended and I parted from these friends, yet at the same time I felt as though I gained unforgettable memories :).",10
"
                Originally, I was supposed to watch this anime during my freshman year of high school. I just graduated 2015 from there, and I've procrastinated a lot on this anime.
What a big mistake that was. 
I'm a lover and a sucker for romance anime's and seeing how this anime is heavily dedicated on it, I can't believe I haven't watched this sooner. 
I really enjoyed the plot and character development within this anime. The art, and sound (Oh let's just include the two openings to the anime, cause I really, really enjoyed them ;w; .. ) just tops it all off. 
In other words, I'd really
                  recommend this anime to romantic lovers. For people who think/can predict/ about cliche' things.. Well. Somehow you'll end up thinking that the anime isn't really cliche.",10
"
                   Toradora is one of the first animes I really watched. 
   Being very honest, I wouldn't call it outstanding, amazing or revolutionary. It's a great anime. It makes you smile, makes you feel things, and inside the genre it belongs to, it avoids a lot of mistakes you usually expect. (You know, those annoying tsundere vices, nonsense decisions in the name of love and etc etc etc.) 
   Also, Taiga and Ryuuji are such captivating characters! They're different (in a certain way), and their relationship trough the history it's something almost innocent? Very innocent, actually. It's all about
                  feeling comfortable around each other, respecting decisions, paying attention and taking care. You tend to see more smiles from both sides and less blushy-girls-stammering while the boy watchs them from above.
    The things is, if you enjoy the shoujo kind of entertainment but also like very human relationships/storytelling, the anime will be great for you. Maybe you'll cry a little bit just like I did. Have a great time <3",9
"
                 I freaking love this anime, as it is known to be a Tsundere classic (In which it should be)
The characters are not rushed together and you don't need to worry about pacing as, apparently it will piss you off but they make up for it.
The story is very solid, no need for anything solid than that.
The art style matches in with the characters' personalities as everyone over-looks that and just think its the style and nothing else. Ryuiji's features show he is big in helping others but is not independent as he has his eyes, needing help to find the way.While Taiga is short
                  and cute, showing that she is short in self esteem but is very self conscious about it.
Sound was reasonable, nothing more nothing less, just okay
Overall I give this a 10/10, this is how every RomCom/Romance anime should base itself off of, original ideas which give off many twist and turns as they play around with the viewer teasing them about the up-coming events. Which happens to be a very big saying as in the ending it does not end as you think it will",10
"
                I would personally rate Toradora! 10/10,
Toradora!, is a romantic/comedy anime with 24 episodes and 1 special episode, the two main/most favorable characters are Ryuuji takasu and 'Palm top' tiger, Ryuuji spends a lot of time attempting to look after tiger, he does everything she says as long as it benefits her.
They try to help each-other stay strong as well, as Ryuuji likes Kushieda (Minori) Tiger's red haired friend, and Tiger likes Kitamura Ryuuji's bestfriend.
The two (Ryuuji + Taiga) spend most of their time, getting eachother to confess the feelings to Minori + Kitamura.
There are many twists in this Romantic/comedy.
It is seriously addictive if you watch
                  one episode you have to watch them all.
This anime also has it's heartbreaking side, as i have watched Toradora! I can definitely say it makes the person watching the Anime feel the feelings that the characters feel. It is a truly suspenseful, emotional + surprising anime, get watching!:D
a random fact: Ryuuji in japanese means dragon + Taiga means Tiger.",10
"
                Toradora is an emotional roller coaster never before have I seen an anime that made me care so much about the characters, im usually pretty cold and hard to reach but toradora broke down my walls. I could really sympathize whith taiga, since I had similar family issues.
The beginning drags on without any real direction but after the first few episodes it really takes off, keep in mind that this is a drama so by take off I mean the feelings start flowing.
The characters slowly grow on you people you thought you hated at the start will become people you actually care about.
The ending was
                  truly amazing one second you'll be extremely happy, and the next you'll feel like you've been punched in the gut, they diddnt leave lose ends so don't worry about that.
The hardest part of any anime is figuring out where the ova fits in, the ova as usual with most animes, has almost nothing to do with the story but I'd suggest watching it after everyone gets back from the beach house I belive it fits best in that time frame cause before that the people involved wouldn't be that friendly and close to the end of the anime it doesn't fit at all.
I highly reccomend Toradora for anyone that likes slice of life, drama, romance, or comedy genres.",10
"
                *SPOILER FREE REVIEW* 
Toradora! is currently the best anime I've ever watched.
And this is coming from somebody who originally didn't even care for the genre.
The outcome of the story becomes obvious straight away (or at least fairly soon in the plot), but this is more about the 'how' than the 'what'.
And the 'how' is done almost perfectly.
The opening six episodes do everything to drag you in to the story and soon after, the 'feels' take over.
You will grow attached to the characters and constantly want to know what happens next.
But despite that, there are no over-dramatic cringe scenes present.
This show just manages to make the
                  mundane brilliant. All the dramatic scenes have a build up and a pay-off. It is just a well flowing, excellently paced show.
Art and sound won't break any records, but they don't need to.
They do their job and do it well.
The character designs are consistent and make sense, the scenery is just beautiful - even when depicting everyday environments.
And the soundtrack just works.
The music is perfectly timed in every scene to give you the full effect.
And both OPs and EDs are catchy, even though I preferred the first set of them to the last.
Characters are very developed and likeable. All of the main cast are twists on a common character archetype.
This turns clichéd shells of characters into well developed, sympathetic and truly alive characters that drive the story forwards.
If you happen to dislike some of the main cast then your enjoyment might suffer, but the chances of that happening a minuscule due to the brilliant writing. 
So I enjoyed this anime a lot, and I would recommend it to almost anime watcher - even one unfamiliar with the genre. It also serves as a great way for people who are new to anime to start watching.",10
"
                This was the first anime to make me cry genuinely.
To what that means you may guess accordingly.
I was just in my room and and scrolling through Tumblr and thought ""What is this anime?"" by looking a gif set post. Watching it, I just thought ""Oh this is just a romantic anime."" but then I found myself watching episode after episode. Eventually downloading the OST and it was clear to me I fell in love with this series. I was able to differentiate characters not only by their hair, but voices and word usage and this to me establishes a great foundation for a story.
I always
                  danced to the opening song as well, so catchy.
The manga is also well worth to look it, the art aesthitics are very pleasing.
Thank you for making me realize I had emotions. 10/10",10

Story: 9
Toradora! has a unique story, different from the classic boy and girl falling for each other, love at first sight. Firstly, the female main character, Taiga, is a short tsundere, while the male main character, Ryuuji, is a friendly boy who looks like a delinquent. But, instead of the story only revolving around the two, there are also three other main characters that the story also focuses on. Taiga is in love with Kitamura, Ryuuji's best friend, while Ryuuji is in love with Minori, Taiga's best friend. So Taiga and Ryuuji decide to help each
                  other out with their love lives by trying to get the other together with their best friend. The story is very interesting, and has a lot of comedy, and there are also other themes. As we go further in, it becomes more emotional and deeper into each of the character's stories. However, I must say that who would end up with who was a little predictable, for me at least, but that didn't affect my enjoyment at all. The pacing was also really good and the story took it's time to show changes in character chemistry and relationships.
Art: 7
The art style isn't really particularly special, but still pleasing to the eye. The animation is also quite cool, especially in the openings.
Sound: 9
I loved the first opening, Pre-parade, the first few seconds already had me hooked. The other opening as well as the endings were also really good. I also liked the music. The seiyuus also portrayed their respective characters really well.
Character: 9
I mentioned this before but I find it really good how they went in-depth on more than just the two main characters. The story went into the backstories of many characters, and their struggles and weaknesses.

I really enjoyed watching Toradora! and it made me really happy.

Toradora! is a great anime! If you like romantic comedies, then this is for you! But even if you don't, I'd still advise that you give this a try, it's definitely worth it.",9
"
                I have never watched a slice or life-comedy-romance anime every before to my knowledge anyway. But I promise you I would have watched most of the anime's on the recommendations page after writing this review, but sadly there will never be an anime quite like Toradora! The story line was amazing, each episodes I was truly astonished about the love and drama they managed to fit into each episode. As the story progressed, so did the relationships between the characters - and my god It was truly tear jerking. I believe that we all dream of love like the one between Ryuuji and Aisaka. I
                  could sit and write for hours about how amazing this anime is and how a season 2 would be amazing but rubbish at the same time. But after finishing this I believe, while still in discussion, the anime ended elegantly - and to me personalty a realistic but optimistic ending which is above the norms for romance. To wrap this up;
The anime is amazing, its a story that people who watch will never regret to see and I believe the story was quite original and the anime is just ... amazing. I struggle to describe a piece of art, no... a masterpiece. I would recommend everyone to watch this as this will truly pull some heart strings and will make you reflect on life and your future. Damn - this is fricking amazing anime - its on like top 3 for me.
Anyways gonna end it here its way past midnight. I have never done a review this long - so many emotions and thoughts surging through my mind. Sadly all good things come to an end. :(
Simplified Review - It's one of the best anime's I have ever seen - just go and watch it.",10
"
                Wow this has to be the most touching anime i have seen to date i almost cried during episodes 23-25 the end was so moving. This is probably the only time i have ever wanted to cry during an anime. From start to finish Toradora has provided a great story arc and outstanding characters. The soundtrack has many great songs and the Art is amazing i suggest that anyone who likes comedy or romance watch this anime.

                A must.
> STORY:
Funny, dramatic, scary (were you expecting that?) and very well adapted from its light novel.
Everything is pretty well told and detailed, focusing on different characters and their feelings (some of them dramatically changing through the story).
But not all is stars, at least for me. There is an enourmous twist in the storyline at about the 19th episode, and even already having predicted that, it was surprising how it all turned out, as characters's feelings seemed to be very clear about what they really meant. It sound crazy because I don't want to spoil anything, so sorry.
The big twist isn't only on the story
                  itself, but it's also on the story's climate. Near the end, it all becomes extremely depressing and dramatic way too drastically. There should be a bigger transition to this twist, so that everyone could ""adapt"" to it (characters and people watching). I didn't adapt, and neither did the characters.
All in all, very nice story, with very funny moments. Still, SPOILER COMING >>> SPOILER GONE. 
> ART:
Animation quality is 99,9%, lacking at fast scenes.
Still, it's all pretty well made and well tasted. J.C Staff quality.
> SOUND:
GREAT OST. One of the best EVER.
But... (hate me for this) the main song was far too played. It should have been saved for only the most dramatic moments.
> CHARACTERS:
They change their feelings out of nowhere, leaving no explaination, and that's what is bad. All the rest is good - everyone is very funny and have deep feelings.
> ENJOYMENT:
Loved it, so funny yet so romantic! Very, very original, even with the usual tsundere from J.C Staff.
Knowing how things would turn out was disappointing, though.
> OVERALL:
A very unique anime, and a must for most anime fans.
Enjoy! :)",9
"
                Warning: I really tried, but spoilers below. 
I think that there’s really three stages of finishing an anime. The first stage is when the credits of the last episode roll and you’re left staring at your computer screen (hopefully in satisfaction) with the final scene seared into your mind. The second stage is shortly afterward, where your mind can’t help but replay what it can – the big moments, the emotional curveballs, the “what if” statements. And the final stage is a while afterward, after you’ve had time to reflect, think about the series retrospectively, maybe talk to some friends about it and really come
                  up with your opinion about the show.
For me, most review writing occurs in either the second or the third stage. I rarely pick up the pen (er, keyboard) seconds after the final scene fades. However, I have noticed a strange correlation between my disposition toward the show and within what category the review falls. For shows that I dislike, I’ll frequently postpone the review writing until stage three, when I’ve had more time to think about what exactly transpired. For shows I like, or those that intrigued me and leave some open questions, I’ll turn sooner to my review desk so I can use the act of writing to flush out those issues in my own mind. The only exception is the really good shows that I can’t feel that I can review properly and thus will sit untouched to this day. However, this isn’t always consistent – some shows I don’t favor will get an earlier review as a sort of emotional catharsis, and some really good shows will be put off till later so I can properly vocalize exactly why I found them well-done.
For me, Toradora falls within the second category. I’m returning soon after the final episode with a mixed bag of emotions running through my mind. Unfortunately, not all of those emotions are positive, and are pointedly negative, in a frustrating opposition to my favorable disposition towards the first three-quarters of this anime’s runtime. I’m generally one to say that I’ll return to amend reviews, and I’ll repeat that refrain here. However, for now, I’ll say that Toradora provided one of the most infuriating falls from grace that I’ve experienced so far. 
What do I mean by this? I’ll illustrate using some examples. Some shows I know I’m going to dislike right from the beginning. Rideback is a pretty typical instance of this. Right from the first few episodes I was disappointed by the lackluster plot, side-character development, and pacing, and this initial disposition remained the same throughout the entire show. On the other hand, Hyouka amazed me with the excellent music, characterization, and compelling story-telling from the early episodes to the end. I can sum this up pretty well using MAL ratings – I knew Rideback was going to be sub-average right from the get-go and that Hyouka would be very good from the opening episode alone. My opinions about the shows, although greatly expanded with new knowledge about plot, characters, and setting, ultimately did not alter in their final judgement. Toradora, on the other hand, started in the Classic Lit clubroom and ended on a mecha motorcycle – my opinion about the show fell dramatically as the series drew to a close.
Enough waffling around. As usual, I’ll look to my typical categories of music, art, and characters. Starting with the former, I don’t see how anyone can’t be anything but impressed. Both openings, beyond being very nostalgic for me (listening to anything years before even knowing what it’s from will do that to you) are really good songs in their own right, and best of all are performed by Horie Yui, whom I’ve already praised in reviews for other shows. They’re very lighthearted, energetic, and very well summarize the majority of the show’s romantic-comedy nature. The only time I skipped the OPs were when I was hanging too far over the cliff – and that’s generally a good sign that they’re doing it for me. Both endings, although particularly the first one, are also really good. I can’t quite say the same for the insert song, but otherwise, the show’s soundtrack was solid, albeit not particularly outstanding. However, in this case I don’t think it needed to be – incredibly standout soundtracks are more fitting for shows with action and reflective scenes, and as much of Toradora is dialogue-based I think a really notable soundtrack may have been intrusive. Overall, I have almost nothing but good things to say about the show’s music, and I really think it did nothing but contribute to the show.
The art, as it tends to be, was more of a mixed bag. Some people really love it, and there’s definetely some scenes where I can see why. It’s hard for me to describe, but I think the best term I can use is “pastel.” This isn’t a Takemoto show where vibrancy is everywhere and tells a story of its own. The colors are a little more muted and a little more subtle, details are a little less explicit and the animation is slightly less exhaustive. It’s not bad, but it’s generally not exactly eye-candy in the way that some other shows are. Again, it’s hard to describe, but it’s also hard for me to explain, because there’s no particularly spot in the show that I can cite exemplifying a unique shortcoming. I think the purpose of this art is to step back a bit and let the characters do the talking, and if that’s true, I feel it achieves this purpose adequately. Not blown away, but can’t complain either.
And here we go, back to my favorite part – the characters. I’ll start by saying that this show has a fairly average-sized cast. There’s five main characters, with about the same number of supporting characters, and a few others that appear shortly to disappear afterward. I will say this right off the bat – I am impressed, very impressed even, with the amount of work that the writers put into developing a truly unique dynamic between each combination of the main five. I feel like too many shows, particularly those in the slice-of-life and romcom genres, generalize interactions between the main cast, where one character will treat most of the others in exactly the same way, perhaps treating only one differently. Perhaps this would be most easily illustrated using an example. A male lead responds to every comment made to him, regardless of from who, with a sarcastic response. In doing so, we can easily characterize this lead as being “sarcastic,” and we pay special attention when he responds to someone without using sarcasm. While this is a helpful category, I really find it more interesting where the unique personality of each character influences the way they interact with each other, rather than each interaction being formulaic. Toradora absolutely does this, and I’d say does it quite well, thanks to its solid characterization and time spent building each of the leads.
OK, time for some specifics. I normally have a hard time deciding who to talk about first, so I’m just going to go off the deep end and start with Taiga. I’ll be honest – when I started the show I wasn’t the biggest fan. I don’t know if “abrasive” is the right word to describe her personality, as she can be positively endearing to her actual friends, but I think a good descriptor would be pretty close. She’s basically described as scary, and short of using the titular analogy here, a pretty typical tsundere. However, as the show progressed, I really began to appreciate her character more and more. She’s quite negative toward Ryuuji, particularly as the show starts, frequently calling him names and accusing him of things he doesn’t deserve. This, however, is tempered throughout the show as their relationship grows and I began to realize that her behavior actually stems from a rather unique upbringing, beyond her stereotypical tsundere qualities. I will say that I did like her determination and will to keep fighting, although this proved increasingly confounding as the show drew to a close – more on that later.
With her out of the way, let’s turn to her male counterpart. Years ago, when I saw the OP animation for the first time, my primary question was “who is the dude with the evil-looking eyes and why is he scrubbing a window-frame with such intensity?” I too, even as a kid, was unknowingly sucked into the common misconception of his delinquency. So it was much to my delight when I learned that he was such a homely, kind person who really seemed to value other people’s well-being above his own, and generally treated everyone with genuine respect. I’ve ranted on this before, but I feel that too many male MCs are flat and lifeless, with maybe one defining character quality that isn’t particularly instructive or redemptive. I’m not saying that Ryuuji is a model character, or that his penchant to cook and clean makes him a saint, but he’s certainly pleasant to watch and is a person I’d love to be around in real life. Building off of this, although the show primarily focuses on his interactions with Taiga, I was also really struck with how he communicates and respects the other three leads. However, his characterization isn’t without its flaws, which again, I’ll get to later.
I’ll turn now to the other male MC, Yuusaku. He’s a bit more of a mixed bag and a confusing one at that. I also think his characterization is one of the weaker ones, as he begins as a sort of generic respectable student council member who happens to be Ryuuji’s best friend, with little other defining features of his own besides being the love interest of the Tiger herself. However, I do feel that he has his defining moments, particularly with the introduction of Ami and during his own sub-arc. He just comes across as being kind of a convenient character, serving multiple roles that could have been picked up by side or extra characters, which confuses his characterization in my mind. Out of the four I can definetely say that he changes the most in the shortest amount of time, at the expense of deeper character development throughout the entire course of the show – kind of too bad.
Since she was referenced in the above paragraph, I’ll swap over to Ami now. She, of everyone, positively infuriated me throughout the show, albeit for different reasons. At first, this was pretty obvious – her two-faced character and incredibly irritating façade frustrated me to no end, although I eagerly looked forward to how this would influence the plot of the show and her own characterization as a whole. As the series bore on, however, I started to become frustrated for a new reason, specifically being that her defining character trait – the fascia itself – seemed to have very little bearing on the plot, and she showed very limited signs of getting past it, although being the very thing that Yuusaku wished for right from the start. Moreover, Ami became infuriating due to just how many times her feigned niceties became downright small cruelties – my worst memory is her pressing a button on the vending machine right as Ryuuji is about to make a different selection. It exposed nothing more about her background and upbringing other than sweeping away any growing respect I had for her, and that, too, is a shame. Again, more on that later.
What’s left is Minori, who is definetely the best-voiced character and by far the most confusing. I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, as she’s certainly portrayed as eccentric, and that eccentricity is a defining part of both her own character and her interaction with others. I also like how that character trait adds to the comedic elements of the rom-com, although I found it becoming strangely less funny and more positively confounding as the show progressed. I want to think this is just her growing involvement in the drama becoming explicit in her mannerisms, but I have a suspicion that the writers simply didn’t know how she should react to more intense situations. I don’t dislike her character, as I do appreciate her desire to work hard and always chase her goals, but I do dislike how little about her is discovered throughout the entire show, and even then in the final few episodes. I feel like her interactions with the males in general and Ryuuji specifically were also among the weakest of the five leads.
Okay, the music has been heard, the art scrutinized, the characters thought-through, what we are left with is the plot. I will say this – I was, in more ways than one – really amazed and impressed with the unique angle that the love triangle/rhombus/polygon took right from the get-go. Most of the time, these romantic comedies have an extremely obvious couple right from the start, and the entire series focuses around their growing relationship culminating in a confession at the end. Toradora has the extremely obvious couple, but the confessions occur much earlier – and not even to each other! Specifically, I thought that the relationship between Taiga and Yuusaku, with the former rejecting the latter, the latter finding a new love interest, and then the latter rejecting the former, formed a much more interesting story. I always dance carefully around using the word “realistic” in anime but somehow the surreptitious route of Taiga’s interest in Yuusaku always appealed to me, and honestly started the show on a very high note. Ryuuji and Minori was a bit weaker, as it’s a pretty common anime trope for someone to become friends with their crush’s bestie, but I did like how it pitted the kindhearted guy with the eccentric girl. Of course, Ryuuji and Taiga teaming up to pair each other with their respective best friends was itself a really entertaining premise, and I found myself becoming surprisingly invested in both characters’ relationships. 
Then Ami happened. Beyond my gripes with her character that I bemoaned above, I actually found myself not minding her introduction so much, despite her apparent antagonism towards almost everything that Taiga attempted to accomplish. Specifically, I thought that her quick resolution of the stalker episode would cause a cracking in her untenable façade, but that didn’t prove as effective as I imagined. Instead, I quickly ascribed her odd interest in Ryuuji, and her frustratingly-possessive behavior towards his person (which honestly bordered on creepy), to completely dash her remaining front of niceness when she realized that he saw right through her. I just couldn’t understand how she remained antagonistic to absolutely everyone – Yuusaku, Ryuuji, Taiga and Minori alike – even as it became increasingly obvious that she wasn’t going to gain his interest. 
I do think that Yuusaku’s arc remains the strongest in the show, with his interest in the school’s president coming to light and really helping to clarify his rejection of Taiga at the show’s very beginning. It’s in this arc that I feel that all of the characters are at their strongest, with both Ryuuji and Taiga taking different actions (and working together!) to stand up for their friend and do what they think is for the best. I also found that Yuusaku’s experience of extremely high expectations, physical abuse from his family, and mental turmoil regarding commitment to someone that ultimately left him, was highly compelling to me. And that’s even without considering this revelation for the romantic plot, which ultimately marked Taiga’s regained ability to interact with him without being nervous. 
While many people regard the final five or six episodes as the highest point of the show, it’s not until here that my disposition toward the series began to shift. I felt that the resolution of the Christmas arc – ending the episode before with Ryuuji feeling effectively rejected by his love interest, would form the apex of the action. Minori’s increasing eccentricity, particularly surrounding her desire to avoid the Christmas party despite her friends’ wishes, made me believe that we would finally get her full story after the fact. I was actually highly disappointed when the twist – Taiga effectively avoiding Ryuuji to increase the two’s interactions – led to nothing significant on Minori’s character despite some cryptic statements on UFOs and ghosts. The ski trip arc was perhaps the most infuriating for me, with surprisingly little true character development besides some bizarre fighting among side-characters, a fruitless Minori-Ryuuji conversation, and a lot of physical violence erupting with the now purely-antagonistic Ami. Taiga’s unconscious confession, although what I now know to be the true climax of the show, left me intrigued but confused, feeling that Minori’s arc had been slammed aside in favor of the two lovebirds.
And after that, everything unravels. In the final four episodes, an odd sub-arc regarding Ryuuji and Taiga’s college and future plans suddenly appears from nowhere, distracting from the parallel plot. Both characters’ nuclear families, and drama surrounding their apparent dysfunctionalities, pop to the forefront, literally in the middle of the true confession episode. This episode itself combines the last meaningful words we hear from all three of Yuusaku, Ami and Minori, who seem to suddenly and instantly resolve their interpersonal problems by gifting the now-eloping-and-escaping couple their valuables. We get a bizarre and extremely rushed resolution to the question of Ryuuji’s biological father and his mother’s relationship with her own parents, immediately resolving a problem that was only hinted at in earlier episodes. The anime ends with Taiga, despite her apparent commitment to Ryuuji, running away a second time to resolve some perceived issues in her own nuclear family, except this resolution seems to take at least an entire year. 
This ending frustrates me both with topics involved and how earlier plot points are tossed aside, seemingly at random. Issues within the nuclear family are truly meaningful and should be given proper time to resolve. In Taiga’s case, the arc with her father coming to resolution much earlier makes me feel that the anime has already dealt with the topic, just to uncover it again during critical moments right at the end. In Ryuuji’s case, the question of his own father, his relationship with his grandparents, and his own mother comes across once or twice in earlier episodes, but is literally both brought to the absolutely forefront and totally resolved within about one, right at the very end. The odd sub-arc about Ryuuji’s college plans, his mother’s commitment to fund them, and his future in general is introduced but also left frustratingly unresolved. Taiga’s future is also left completely up in the air, with her literally disappearing again at the end of the show leaving only cryptic text messages, a full-year time skip, and a weird anticlimactic reunion between the two mains. Meanwhile, other meaningful plot topics are abandoned. Yuusau goes to study in the United States – did he resolve his relationship with the president or is that irrelevant now? Minori’s true feelings, yelled out across the school hallways a few episodes prior, are pretty much lost to the wind. Ami, as far as I can tell, remains just as meanspirited beneath her cheery exterior as ever. 
Looping back around to my earlier assertion about my disposition toward this anime changing as it got closer to the end, I can safely say that I was considering giving this show an 8 about ¾ of the way through, only to have the score drop all the way to a 6 by the time it ended. I just can’t accept an ending that throws aside so many nuanced character relationships for the sake of bringing up side-topics that were apparently resolved earlier in the anime or otherwise merely hinted at. Taiga and Ryuuji’s relationships with their immediately families are super important in their own rights, but should have been given proper time to work themselves out, rather than being slammed in together at the end, basically forcing out any resolution for the remaining three leads. In my mind, cut out the horror-cave episodes to put Taiga’s family resolution within the arc concerning her father, and leave Ryuuji ample time to work out his own pain points with his mother and relatives. 
Wow, somehow this review, along with ballooning to over 3500 words, has become more of a complaint and criticism about how it should have ended, typically something that I dislike and try to avoid. Maybe it’s this close proximity to having just finished the show itself, but somehow, I feel the need to put this series down for a while. Disappointment in a show isn’t something I’m unfamiliar with, but generally this disappointment is something I can expect from the early episodes. Toradora is something not that I wanted to love, but something that I actually loved, throughout so much of it, just to have my expectations dashed in what I can only describe as an unsatisfactory end. As always, your mileage may vary, but I have warned you in the only way I know how.",6

                I absolutely love this anime. I'm normally not into the mushy lovey kind of stuff but this was exceptional. this is how a romantic comedy anime should be done. Take out all of the fanservice and put a good Slice of Life with a worthwhile ending. My favorite character had to be the fugly bird. I was cheering that damn thing on like nobody's business! The rest of the characters were exceptional as well. There are so many turns throughout the story and it just keeps you on edge the entire time. This is the first anime with an ending that I actually really really
                  liked..",9
"
                Love and Peace. Romance and Comedy. TigerxDragon. Toradora. The same guy who recommended me K-on, recommended me this anime. I still didn't believe in his taste in anime after his K-on recommendation that is, but after watching Toradora...I'm left speechless.
Pros:
-Cute romance 
-Solid cast (Ryuuji has crept his way into my favourites! Taiga is also a good female protagonist, but I'm not really into Tsunderes, tbh)
-Excellent art and visuals. (Nice background scenery, good character designs; I love Ryuuji's character design.)
-Solid ending. (I'm not going to go into too much detail on the ending, but THANK GOD its not some shitty harem ending.)
-Several very memorable moments(first encounter
                  of Ryuuji and Taiga, some fight scenes and the ending was kinda LOL).
Cons:
-Highly predictable (I'm preeeeetttttyyyyy sure you know what's going to happen next, most of the time)
-Tends to avoid ""progression"" from time to time.
-Drama is too overdone. (Drama is a subjective thing, you'll either love or hate it, but when its overblown, it somewhat ruins the show. Thats just my opinion though.)
-Story is nothing unique (just your run-of-the-mill love story among teenagers, nothing too special or unique.)
Conclusion: All in all, a good romance anime. Brought down by melodrama here and there but I guess you can live with that. I highly recommend this to fans of romcoms. Even if you're like me(still fresh to romance and comedy anime), you'll still enjoy it.",7
"
                i startd watching toradora because all the good reviews i've had read about it, and i must say something: it's not a masterpiece, but is well-done. the character of ryujii is one of the best main male characters i've seen: a teenage boy who everyone can´t relate on. taiga sometimes is adorable and funny, sometines is annoying. there's really good storylines(ami and the stalker, or why ryujii and taiga started to be allies) and thing i cant believe. kitamaru, the most popular boy in school? some episodes, the most, it sounds realy unbelieveble to me.

"
                Its one of my personal favorites.  I only watched action/adventure/psychological anime before until Toradora introduced me to the rom-com/slice of life genre.  The first few episodes caught my attention because it was hilarious. The scenario when a small girl suddenly invaded your house attempting to kill you just because you found her missing love letter is pure exaggeration, after talking things over both of you agreed to help each other out dealing with your highs school crush problems, well that was interesting! Its the start of misadventures, funny moments and relationship development of takasu, taiga and friends . If the 1st half is
                  more about the joy of youth, it became a bit more serious on the 2nd half and i started appreciating the story and the romantic side of this anime. 
Takasu's delinquent image i think is just a front to make his character more interesting, he's actually a gentle person and responsible. Taiga is a typical tsundere with family issues, your annoying but cute type of friend while her best friend Minori is a sporty, weird, hard working and in my opinion the best girl of TD. Kitamura is their class rep, vice pres of student council, basically he's a type of friend who leads the gang with some weirdness like minori. Lastly we have Ami, she's pretty and cool but the only issue was her identity whether to act as a celebrity/model or simply be herself . Taiga made her realized that she doesn't need to act perfect all the time to be loved by people.  We have this combination of personalities here that you may also relate with your our own circle of friends.
Now i might go subjective here, what made this show special for me is it really touches the heart strings. They got some scenes where some simple conversations and character narrations about life accompanied by acoustic background music just made the moments so heart-felt, its making me catch my breath, basically they've got good soundtracks and used it so well.  I recall an episode where minori and takasu are applying some metaphors  of ghost/UFO to their conversation, and that was perfectly played by the writer.  I just witnessed the most intimate conversation about ghost, plus the subtle scenes like the Popsicle melting and minori's smile at the end, who'd have thought that they were talking about love.  I was like, that's some mutual understanding goin' on there.  Speaking of minorin, i wish they had a better ending for her. I understand why its takasuXtaiga but its hard to see character like that get nothing. I guess that's why the soundtrack says love is something pure, sweet and Bitter.
After completing TD, i started watching other rom-coms/slice of life like golden time, sakurasou, ao haru ride, ano hana, tonari no kaibutsu etc. They're all good but this show for me is the best because the peak of its comedy and romance is just SO Right. That's why its called ROM-COM it WON'T give you a tragic end / heavy drama, over complicated scenarios and a lot of serious romance all episodes. Well, for the slice of life part, other shows are better.",9
"
                I liked this anime, I loved this anime , I hated it ,I've mixed feelings about this anime.
I have now confirmed that romance anime arent exactly my thing, cause when I watch I become the character but I also have my preferences , I want me to end up with the girl I like.
From The beginning onwards it was pretty predictable that Takesu( I watched A Dub this time so I dont know the exact spelliings and names , so bear with me)
and taiga would fall head over heels for each other , I mean that much was obvious , I mean how many times
                  have we seen the same thing? But I wished that wouldnt be the case ...
I wanted Ami to hook up with Takesu ,I mean like she was the person who first showed any interest in him and had all those romantic incidents , But NOOO!!! , Takesu doesent see her like that and whenever she tries to say something he apparently is deaf , he should really see and an ophthalmologist about that , but wait he only doesnt hear HER say it ,, what a drag , and she is like the dog barking up the wrong tree , she just keeps embarassing herself ,and in the end she doesnt even tell her I love you instead she keeps mump and stays a saint .
And what the hell is up with that kitamura or whatever giving the tough guy act and falling in love with whoever  , I hate his guts.
Toward the second half , Ami just becomes someone who comes in cheer or scold Takesu , Whats up with that.?
Anywho , I didnt downright hate it , mainly because the story was pretty good and I enjoyed it to the last moment.
I know its an old anime(comparatively) so if you havent watched it yet you should give it a go , you're sure to enjoy that. And I know its late I kind of sorry If accidentally squeezed any spoilers up there.",8
"
                Currently my favorite show, no spoilers in this review. Be sure to check for after credits since two or three episodes have some short scenes. The last episode has an after credits scene and I think that many people disliked the ending because they missed it. 
I started hating some of the characters at the beginning, but those characters quickly became my favorites as they developed. All the characters were realistic to an extent and had fantastic development throughout the story. You won't regret watching this if you've liked other romcoms or slice of life shows. The ending was satisfying and made Toradora feel like
                  a complete and perfectly executed story.
This show is unlike any other I've watched, characters with somewhat ridiculous personalities come together and form a unique and relatable group. Throughout the story each character changes the personalities of others in the group, while maintaining a humorous and light hearted atmosphere that makes difficult situations bearable. Although I wish there was more content, this anime did not leave me feeling empty inside, unlike other shows, when it was over. Few shows have an ending comparable to that of toradora's, leaving no loose ends and providing a definite end to the story.
The soundtrack and op/ed themes were perfect, and the story was unique and not too cliche. The characters felt like those in kimi no na wa: not perfectly realistic but enjoyable in a different way. Thanks for reading",10
"
                It is baffling to me how popular Toradora was during the late 00s/early 10s while being this highly rated. This show is up there in popularity with the KyoAni shows at the time, and right now it is 18th on MAL. Whoever did the marketing for this show deserves a raise.
The premise and the main arc of the two protagonists is one which has happened many times in romance stories, so there isn't anything unpredictable there. However, the path this show takes to get there is frustratingly confusing. Initially it seems like a fairly upbeat comedy and that Taiga's aggressive behaviour is more ""cartoon logic""
                  than real. However, after a few episodes it becomes clear that Taiga is literally beating up people (and attempts to murder someone later on) with no real consequences for her actions. The upbeat nature of the show also disappears and is replaced with an incredibly slow, drawn out drama. Interactions between these characters becomes increasingly centered around something dramatic rather than just building on their relationships and seeing them interact. 
Since the show decides to follow the drama, this leads to many stupid situations in the second half of the show. It gets to the point where I start questioning why these people even hang out with each other since they don't seem to have any fun doing it. This continues all the way to the ending where the show completely ditches reality and we see our protagonists making the strangest decisions when the simplest ones would have sufficed. This is made worse by the fact that we really don't learn much about these characters before they make these decisions. The supporting cast also make confusing decisions such as deciding they like someone when we've barely seen them interact. By the end of the show I'm not even sure if any of these people should be friends, and they're all talking about how they like/liked each other and how sad it made them. All I know is that if this was real life, Ryuji would have moved on to one of the many girls who apparently seem to like him during the show's ending. Also, any of these relationships would have a high chance of failure.
There are plenty of better romance shows out there, especially now with the explosion of anime recently. Don't bother with this one.",4
"
                STORY~ (8)
Toradora! is a story about a boy, Ryuuji Takasu, and a girl, Aisaka Taiga. Ryuuji is known as a delinquent in school, despite his gentle and caring nature, and Aisaka is known as the ""Palmtop Tiger"" and is feared by students and teachers, although this is pretty accurate and expected considering her hostile and violent nature. 
Aisaka and Ryuuji live right next door to each other and eventually make a deal to help the other out with their love life seen as both of them seem to be the victim of unrequited love.
Although Toradora! seems like a typical romance anime with the same plot
                  as almost all the rest, it's not and that's what surprised me. I was never once bored watching Toradora! and there were plenty of plot twists to keep me entertained. 
If romance anime isn't for you, there might still be a chance you will enjoy this anime as it has just the right amount of humour and slice of life thrown into 25 episodes to balance out the main love story plot.
ART~ (7)
The main focus in Toradora was definitely the characters art wise, because even though the character design and animation wasn't all that good, there were still bits to admire about the characters whereas there wasn't anything very special about the background and scenery, hat being said, there wasn't really anything I can say was bad about it either. I will say this though: when it comes to animation, they definitely worked from the phrase ""simple is better."" 
SOUND~ (9)
I found the voices of the characters very enjoyable and all of the voice actors did a great job with their characters in my opinion. 
CHARACTER~ (10)
The best thing about Toradora! I found was the characters. They were all very relatable, with plenty of character development and you get to see many sides to them all. By the end of the series I was thinking of them as people I knew as oppose to characters in an anime. 
ENJOYMENT/OVERALL~ (9)
Overall, I enjoyed Toradora! very much and would recommend it to anyone who asked!:)",9
"
                Toradora... what I have to say... is a great anime.
It's not just about romance, it's about normal life. I loved all of the main characters, i.e. Ami, Kitamura, Minori, Taiga, and Ryuji. They all have their own problems, which got me involved in such beautiful melody. I didn't think I would love this anime at the beginning, but it's just getting more and more exciting to watch, because of such meaningful story, about life, and about an amazing love.
Starting from episode 21, everything was like so good that I don't ever bother to watch them over and over again. Tora x Dora's love finally reveal,
                  the deep meaning of family... they were like too amazing for an anime! I have no good words to describe it properly, but I have to say... episode 21 and up are super cool!
Story (9) / Character (10): so average score is 9.5
Nice written! I love it. Fisrt episodes I was like, ""oh please hurry and let me see your chemistry to each other!"", in the middle I was like, ""OK so these two will never have chemistry somehow, but how are they going to love each other? They are loving other people!"", but really, now I'm like, ""No need chemistry or romance here, all the charaters are so adorable, I even love that bird, Inko-chan, eh well..."".
Art: 10
At first, I was like, ""Oh god that Takasu-kun is too ugly compared to other anime guys out there"", but in the end I love that face lol, it fits the story so well and his inside is much much more accordant to talk about now.
Anyway, I love the art.
Sound/ Music: 9
Unique #1 opening song. That's the only thing to say. Oh also the rest OST were nice, but that unique song was a standout. I totally loved it!
Enjoyment: 9
My personal enjoyment is 9. Another watch-for-just-1-week anime done ^^.
Overall: 9.  It must be 9.5 to be exact though. But not a 10, not this one :p",9

                - English Review (Translated version)
I've been deeply disenchanted with ""Toradora!"". The worst of all is that it wasn't because of its genre (I knew perfectly what I was getting into), its characters (which have charisma and are well defined), or even the majority of its plot itself (it's a ""slice of life"", it is what it is). What was the problem then? What is made the final perception so bittersweet and disappointing, even with all the good that ""Toradora!"" has (which it has)? Well... its progression is horrible. Very horrible. Like a garden labyrinth in which you go round and round in a circle and
                  finally end up kicking a hole in the bushes.
I'm going to try to explain myself in more detail, but first I'd like to talk about the good things about ""Toradora!"", so if you just want to read about the bad you can skip to the end of this review. The best thing about this anime are the characters, I have no doubt about that. The two main characters, Taiga and Ryuji, are a breath of fresh air. Each with his own personality, peculiar and very marked, charismatic and with great capacity to generate sympathy and empathy. In addition, together they form a great couple, truly fun and endearing. The secondary ones are not left behind either. Characters like Minori or Ami become indispensable. Very great group of characters except Kitamura, which seems to me a quite forgettable character, generic until to say enough and without any attraction. The good level is maintained even in secondary characters with little importance, such as Yasuko (although towards the end it becomes crucial), Haruta or the misunderstood teacher, who gives some of the best comic scenes of the show almost without pretending it.
The other strong point of ""Toradora!"" is its sound section. Without being the best in the history of anime, it does have a very remarkable quality. Their openings/endings are quite solvent and are perfectly placed in each episode to multiply their impact, which makes them look even better than they are. The OST in general is also very good, with several melodies bordering on a high level, stay in your mind and you end up recognizing instantly. I also wanted to mention the great work of dubbing/voice acting. I've never done it in any review, because in fact I've never paid much attention to the role of the ""seiyuu"" except in very specific cases. The fact is that in ""Toradora!"" I was struck by the voices in characters such as Taiga, Yasuko and especially Minori. Not only because of their voices themselves, which in the end match their character is the minimum, but also because of the spectacular amount of registers and nuances they have throughout the 26 episodes according to the moment.
And I come to what has made me rethink my score and what has caused my final sensations, once the last episode has finished, have been so negative. As I said the development is very badly handled. The story swirls again and again in the same thing without advancing, except for very punctual moments (three or four perhaps) in which suddenly something shocking happens and everything takes a huge leap forward. On second thought, this structure is not far from any romance or ""slice of life"" anime, right? It is possible, but it is that... the end, the end is indefensible. I don't intend to value what is happening in itself, which is something more subjective (I personally think it's a horrendous choice on the part of screenwriters), but rather to focus on HOW it happens. Without making any spoilers, the final two episodes unleash a series of events in a ridiculously hasty way, very poorly explained and also (and this is what hurts me the most) completely incoherent with the tone of the plot and with the personalities of the protagonists. Without any sense. A disastrous final touch, a final touch that throws everything else to the ground. The epilogue after the last ending not only does not help to change this impression, but makes it even worse. I think it could hardly be worse. And it is a pity, because ""Toradora!"" has many good things and also a lot of potential, but it is totally wasted.
- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)
Me he llevado una profunda decepción con ""Toradora!"". Lo peor de todo es que no ha sido por su género (sabía perfectamente dónde me metía), por sus personajes (que tienen carisma y están bien definidos), ni siquiera por la mayoría de su trama propiamente dicha (es un ""slice of life"", es lo que es). ¿Cuál ha sido el problema entonces? ¿Qué es lo que ha hecho que, aún con todo lo bueno que ""Toradora!"" tiene (que lo tiene), la percepción final haya sido tan agridulce y decepcionante? Pues... su desarrollo es horrible. Muy horrible. Como un laberinto de jardín en el que das vueltas en círculo sin parar para acabar saliendo de allí abriendo un agujero a patadas en los arbustos.
Voy a intentar explicarme con más detalle, pero primeramente me gustaría hablar de las cosas buenas de ""Toradora!"", así que si solo quieres leer sobre lo malo puedes saltar hasta el final de esta review. Lo mejor de este anime son los personajes, de eso no tengo ninguna duda. Los dos protagonistas, Taiga y Ryuji, son un soplo de aire fresco. Cada uno con su propia personalidad, peculiar y muy marcada, carismáticos y con gran capacidad para generar simpatía y empatía. Además juntos forman una pareja genial, verdaderamente divertida y entrañable. Los secundarios tampoco se quedan atrás. Personajes como Minori o Ami se vuelven imprescindibles. Grandísimo plantel de personajes exceptuando a Kitamura, el cual me parece un personaje bastante olvidable, genérico hasta decir basta y sin ningún atractivo. El buen nivel se mantiene incluso en personajes secundarios con poca importancia, como Yasuko (aunque hacia el final se vuelve clave), Haruta o la incomprendida profesora, que deja algunas de las mejores escenas cómicas de la serie casi sin pretenderlo.
El otro punto fuerte de ""Toradora!"" es su apartado sonoro. Sin ser lo mejor de la historia del anime, sí que tiene una calidad muy destacable. Sus openings/endings son bastante solventes y están perfectamente colocados en cada capítulo para multiplicar su impacto, lo que hace que parezcan aún mejores de lo que son. La BSO en general también es muy buena, con varias melodías rayando a un gran nivel, de las que se quedan en tu mente y terminas reconociendo al instante. También quería mencionar el gran trabajo de doblaje/actuación de voz. Nunca lo he hecho en ninguna review, porque de hecho nunca me había fijado demasiado en el papel de los ""seiyuu"" salvo en casos muy puntuales. El caso es que en ""Toradora!"" me han llamado la atención en personajes como Taiga, Yasuko y especialmente Minori. No solo por sus voces, que al fin y al cabo que peguen con su personaje es lo mínimo, sino por la espectacular cantidad de registros y matices que tienen a lo largo de los 26 capítulos según el momento.
Y llego a lo que me ha hecho replantearme mi puntuación a la serie y a lo que ha provocado que mis sensaciones finales, una vez acabado el último capítulo, hayan sido tan negativas. Como decía el desarrollo está muy mal llevado. La historia remolonea una y otra vez en lo mismo sin avanzar lo más mínimo, salvo momentos muy puntuales (tres o cuatro quizá) en los que de pronto ocurre algo impactante y todo da un salto hacia adelante enorme. Joder, pensándolo bien esta estructura no dista mucho de cualquier anime de romance o cualquier ""slice of life"", ¿no? Es posible, pero es que... el final, el final es indefendible. No quiero entrar a valorar lo que ocurre en sí, que es algo más subjetivo (a mí personalmente me parece una elección horrorosa por parte de los guionistas), sino centrarme en CÓMO ocurre. Sin hacer ningún spoiler, en los dos capítulos finales se desatan una serie de acontecimientos de una forma ridículamente precipitada, muy mal explicada y además (y esto es lo que más me duele) completamente incoherente con el tono de la obra y con las personalidades de los protagonistas. Sin ningún sentido. Un broche final desastroso, un broche final que tira por tierra todo lo demás y para más inri en el punto más álgido de un anime. El epílogo después del último ending no solo no ayuda a cambiar esta impresión, sino que la empeora todavía más. Creo que difícilmente se podría hacer peor. Y es una pena, porque ""Toradora!"" tiene muchas cosas buenas y también mucho potencial, pero se queda totalmente desaprovechado.",5
"
                i just finished the show like 2 days ago after seeing all the praise for it and how it's apparently one of the best romance (and comedy) animes and all that stuff. and maybe im missing something but i did NOT like this show at all. this is clearly a show that relies heavily on you sympathizing and/or liking all the characters, so maybe my dislike towards most of the cast is the reason i don't like this show. i can usually memorise an anime cast's names after maybe 10 episodes, but even watching episode 22 of toradora, i found myself wondering ""wait who's ryuuji?
                  google searches ryuuji toradora to see the characters face "" because of how forgettable the cast was. 
the only time i liked the main character and the tiger (blonde hair short girl) is when they're alone together in a scene since i believe they have good chemistry together. anything outside of that circumstance i find them kinda annoying. 
MINORIN is REALLY FUCKIN ANNOYING HOLY SHIT. her entire character is being an overly obnoxious happy supporting character with a GASP SERIOUS SIDE TO HER WOAHHH WAIT YOU'RE TELLIN ME THE OVERLY HAPPY GIRL IN AN ANIME HAS FEELINGS??? WHAAATT and then the ending is some BUUUULLLSHITTTT acting as if she ever fuckin liked the main character. i genuinly believe the writers wrote the start and middle of the show as if minorin DIDN'T like ryuji but then added that part at the end for drama. its some serious bullshit imo she CLEARLY DIDN'T ROMANTICALLY LIKE THE RYUJI, OR ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER. and also i dont even understand why i would ever cheer for her and ryuji to be together for that matter, even at the beginning all their conversations in the show together alone are super awkward, it's pretty much the same formula of ""minorin acts overly happy and makes the unfunniest jokes with ryuji, ryuji acts gullible as fuck to whatever she's saying, repeat last two steps X2, then out of nowhere minorin gets really deep with ryuji for some reason talking about her feelings acting like they're super conveluted"" IT'S SO ANNOYING TO START OFF A SCENE WITH THESE TWO WHEN I KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE CONVERSATION IS GOING TO UNFOLD, IT MAKES THEM FEEL LIKE SUCH ROBOTS. 
the blue hair guy with glasses is such a weird oddball character, i find him so unlikeable for some reason. i think that part with him dyeing his hair blonde and being in love with the student council member was ACTUALLY interesting and it made me start to like him but after that he went back to his normal unlikeable self so it ended up leaving no impression on me. 
and that part where the lion goes to FIGHT the student council member might be the worst scene of this whole show for how TERRIBLY EXECUTED IT WAS. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT HIGHLIGHT OF THE SHOW BUT THEY START THE SCENE OFF AS IF IT'S A JOKE. WHY DO THESE GOOFY ANIME GIRLS HAVE LIKE BAMBOO STICKS LMFAOOOOOO. I ACTUALLY FOUND IT FUNNY IN CONCEPT BUT THEN I SLOWLY REALISED oh this is supposed to be a serious scene cause now they're both bleeding. this scene ended up making the blonde hair girl super unlikeable too, especially when there's pretty much no consequence for what she did, which was pick a serious fight with an innocent student council member who's spent her years making sure your school life was a better experience, just because she didn't recipricate feelings for someone you like, WHICH SHE HAS A TOTALLY VALID REASON WHEN SHE EXPLAINS IT. and if you believe the consequence for the blonde hair girl was GETTING 2 WEEKS OFF, THAT'S A JOKE CAUSE BRO THAT'S BASICALLY JUST A FREE FUCKIN HOLIDAY LMAOOOO 
ryuuji's friends outside of the main group are way fuckin unlikeable and SO FORGETTABLE, i have nothing else to say about them, they have no character outside of talking about WOMEN and how awesome it would be for the girls to be maids at school and how sexy the blue hair model is because apparently that serves as comedy
speaking of the blue hair model, she's SOMEHOW THE ONLY CHARACTER I KIND OF LIKE, the start of her character was interesting, after she starts to become an asshole i liked the direction her character took, she's also a character that moves the plot along which im grateful for. however there's a lot of things i dont like about her either, like how for some reason she likes the main group of friends??? maybe im missing something there but whatever it's excuseable i guess maybe you just need her to like the main group of friends for the plot to advance. now, WHY DOES SHE EVEN LIKE RYUJI? I DONT FUCKIN KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE SHE DOESN'T KNOW EITHER, HE'S CLEARLY AN IDIOT AS YOU CALL HIM THAT EVERY INTERACTION YOU GUYS HAVE, maybe cause he's loving and nice to others? but there's barely enough scenes to justify that answer so i genuinly don't understand her love for him, maybe cause the two other girls like him? whatever
also about her appearence, i feel the same way about this that i do about ann from persona 5 (funny cause they both have the same english va hah), for some reason everybody praises her appearence even though she looks the exact fuckin same as every other girl in her school, even her body looks the same as everyone else's, there's nothing eyecatching about her, it's like the show is asking me to believe that she is just objectively more attractive than every other character in the show when it's just not true
anyways, i have nothing else to say about this show, it was so unbelieveably bad i dont understand how anyone could say this is a great anime in my opinion. i'd give it like maybe a 3-4/10",3
"
                All I can say is, That's a great Anime. No Doubt :)
The Story is great, a lot of twist, i laugh me ass off.
The Ending is nice, The characters has their own amazing personalities.
A nice anime~ Watch it like 3 times already and overall it's not that boring even if I memorized all the line ^_^

"
                tl;dr the rough start kind of shaped the whole anime, but as the story progressed it became more of a mixed bag as the show as a whole wasn’t amazing nor terrible either. The complexity of the characters (which were often at times realistic) was what definitely salvaged this show, especially since romance animes tend to be character driven. The story, art/animation, and sound were alright with some good comedy sprinkled from beginning to end. (Final Score at the bottom)
Now let’s get started with the detailed review (Beware, Minor/Major Spoilers ahead)
Story: The concept of having 2 characters helping each other’s pursuit of gaining the favor
                  of their crushes was what led me to wanting to watching this anime originally, but it kind of just took a backseat early on.  Other than that, I haven't really seen anything unique from your typical High school Romance story.
Art/Animation: Nothing worth noting as it’s passable considering the time/year it was released.
Sound: The intros/endings were alright and the soundtrack is forgettable. (TBH, I never really pay attention to soundtracks unless they manage to catch my attention to the point that I try and search for them so that I can re-listen to them or maybe just search for one particular song from the soundtrack but this is probably my weak point when it comes to reviews, So I apologize in advance.)
Characters: The main character (Ryuuji) isn't so bad himself because you have someone who is misunderstood but in reality is a real nice guy and who also happens to be a clean freak, but he also has a very frustrating side to him. Taiga’s character if i’m being honest can be credited towards my original decision to drop this anime and this was due to her overly abusive side which I found annoying (as it's not only physical but verbal abuse as well) and her over the top klutziness didn’t help change this sentiment. The fact that she also looks and acts like a child most of the time didn’t help either (If she acted a bit childish every now and then, I most likely wouldn’t mind) and I really wanted to like her but all I really did was pity her, however she did have a few redeeming moments here and there.
The supporting cast/characters didn’t really leave an impact on me because their purpose was basically to serve as catalysts to help move certain characters closer together and also to make character interactions more entertaining, but to be fair they were good friends that tended to look out for each other. Although, acting as catalysts isn’t necessarily a bad thing but it kind of undermines the premise of the story, but that didn’t take anything away from Ami’s character in particular because I found her character amusing/complicated and was also a big fan of her development most of all throughout the story (including the main characters).
Personal Thoughts: I remember reading once from an article that the japanese often wish they were more like their anime counterparts which were more honest, upbeat, and over the top, Instead of their usual overly formal/polite, shy, and quiet demeanor mixed in with the mentality of everyone for themselves being present at times, which can be accredited to stress from their busy lives and also wanting to mind their own business to avoid making a scene in public.  The reason why I bring this up is because at times I felt that certain situations/scenes seemed forced and unrealistic which only led to remind me of that specific article I remember reading a while back (the one mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph). I found those scenes/situations to also be ironic because other reviews were praising this show for being realistic/relatable, but those reviews despite being the reason why I decided to give toradora a second chance only further served to highlight for me that everyone has diverse taste and what might be an enjoyable experience for others might not be the case for the rest of the audience who might find it to be a “dud”. In my case I find myself associating more with the latter sentence or somewhere in between despite really wanting to fully enjoy this anime from start to finish, but simply couldn’t and I even had to drop it once before I decided to pick it up again (as previously mentioned) with a renewed determination to complete it (as I'm not a big fan of dropping anime). 
After ep. 4 I honestly felt like the “crushes” were superficial or shallow and were just being used as more of an obstacle for the eventual “opposites attract” couple (although personally it felt like more of a sibling type relationship), I also wasn’t a fan of characters leading others on, only for those characters to end up getting hurt (it was honestly very cruel even for a plot device). This led to me disliking Toradora as a romance anime even more because I tend to consider myself as a fan of the underdog almost always. So, that's why I always find the inclusion of rivals risky because the rival usually ends up being more interesting than the main love interest. Unfortunately, this was one landmine that Toradora didn’t manage to evade considering that toradora is a romance anime first and foremost meaning that most of the time, the goal of romance animes is to have you root for the main couple getting together and having the audience at the end of the journey say something along the lines of “Hey, they deserve each other” after seeing what they went through and becoming emotionally invested with the characters, but for Toradora the romance felt one-sided most of the time, as you could definitely see why a certain character eventually fell for the other side (they were being taken care of) but the same couldn’t be said for the other side and the couple/duo ended up feeling forced to say the least.
While I can appreciate Toradora’s attempt of trying to go outside the box, it doesn’t mean that the show didn’t stumble in doing so along the way and I feel like I would have enjoyed this story/show more if the approach/premise had been different and instead having it start out as a comedy about siblings and co. with their individual love lives being touched upon as the series progressed because honestly the romance or feelings of other characters in “Toradora” felt more natural than the main couple itself and this eventual couple served as a distraction at times because I kept dreading the final outcome that had been foreshadowed from the beginning of the series. 
Toradora also managed to capture the feeling that when you are going through some rough patches that it can make you feel like you’re alone when that might not be the case (a nice added bonus), but it kind of lost it’s effect after it was a recurring sentiment for one character specifically. 
Lastly, would I ever rewatch this show? The answer would have to be No.
Individual scores(Decided to give a score after every 4 eps to see if my thoughts on the anime would change as the story progressed): Ep. 4 = 2, Ep. 8 = 3, Ep. 12 = 4, Ep. 16 = 5, Ep. 20 = 5, Ep. 25 = 5.5 
Final Score: 5.2/10
P.S. I’m still trying to figure out my go-to review format, therefore I apologize if it’s lengthy, confusing, or repetitive but I hope I managed to get my points across without it seeming like I was bashing this anime too much, It’s just that I tend to be very hard on shows that I place high expectations on.",5
"
                Well to start off this anime have the best and most fantastic story line in my opinion. The way how you bond with the characters and understand everyone life is the reason why it make the story line so deep and unusual (In the good way) But the personality of each character gives and does effect the plot of the story. One thing that i should also point out that interest me about this anime is that, the voice actress are all branched off/from different major anime. (Like Rie Kugimiya voiced ""Taiga"" and shes the voice actress of ""Mizore Shirayuki"" from Rosario + Vampire)
Also if
                  your getting into the genre of ""Slice of life"" or/and ""School Life"" this is a fantastic/unforgettable show to start off with and to watch
(This is also my first review. Don't hate)
*Edit*
An other thing that i find fascinating about this series/anime is that, it expands, stretches and also explains a lot of back story when you view it from different sources (i.e light novel/manga/game and etc). And for anyone who never seen the show yet and loves to read books, i recommend reading the book first then watch this anime. You will understand more of the characters thoughts and personality's.",10
"
                Toradora is a brilliant highschool slice of life romance anime. Lead by two main characters with unique personalities, it was a joy to watch the story unfold over 25 amazing episodes.
The art style has a mature palette made even more sentimental with a the presence of a reddish/bluish tint found throughout the series. The natural outdoor backdrops and weather are of particular note as they really do feel ""alive"" and evokes emotion from the viewers.
The soundtrack of Toradora is outstanding; the important scenes are further highlighted by sweeping piano orchestrations soaked in melancholy.
Individual characters shine in this anime, the main cast have distinct personalities which
                  still shine through even when things were at their darkest.
And it does get very sentimental and mature which is refreshing to see in a slice of life romantic anime which is sometimes categorized as comedy.
There is plenty of heart and soul to be found in this outstanding anime.
Be sure to also check out the specials too.
Toradora is a gem in it's genre!",10
"
                One thing it constantly frustrates me iis how anime writters and producers have so many great, ingenious ideas, just to execute them terribly bad *cough* SAO *cough*. Aaaand Toradora is not exception to this. The anime comunity praises this show as one of the greatest romances ever, and it could have been, if it wasn't because the creators of this series forgot one tiny tiny detail : SUBTLETY.
STORY 6/10
Ok , this was for me the biggest dissapointment of the series, by far. They have all this great ideas for the different arcs, and then they are doing a great job in executing it, aaaand just
                  when you are on the climax, waiting to see the grand finale, it turns into this over the top over dramatic ridiculous story that leaves you with a giant WTF!!! moment. Don't know what I mean:
For example, you have this arc about Kitamura, that deals with the conflict of having the person you love go far away from you, and the burden of taking a position that involves a lot of responsability, especially since the loved one was the person in charge of said position. Great topic for a story, and you have genuinely emotional moments, like when Taiga wants to watch Kitamura's sleeping face ( after he escaped home) and she sees he cried to sleep. 
But then by the end of the arc, you have the confession where Kitamura starts to scream at the top of his lungs in front of all the school that he loves the council president (whose name I don't remmeber) , and as if this wasn't ridiculous enough, Taiga gets in a overly ridiculous and over the top sword fight with the president, because Taiga was furious that she hurt Kitamura only because president wasn't able to accept the feelings she had for Kitamura, and even though the explanation as to why she couldn't do it made sense, after all those ridiculous events I couldn't give less of a shit.
Another example, Taiga showing her affection for Ryuji while they were friends. Good example: When Ryuji is trying to convince Taiga to give her father an opportunity to fix their relation, and when he starts to explain how lucky she is that her father is still alive, and is on the brink of tears, Taiga only caress his face and says: ''Ok , i'll go but don't put that face'' 
Bad Example: During the swimming competition, when Ryuji is drowning, and Taiga, who two seconds ago couldn't swim, suddenly becomes a profesional diver, and to make matters worse, when people try to approach Ryuji to help him , she starts to yell histerically ''DONT TOUCH MY RYUJI!!! even though she wasn't even in love with him yet.
Why does the first example works? Because of how realistic and relatable it is. The second one isn't only over the top, but ridiculous and stupid.
This example sumarizes all the problems I had with the story of Toradora, there are tons of other examples but it's gonna take me an eternity to describe them, so i'll just leave it at that.
Art: 7/10
It does it's job for the most part, but there are a lot of scenes that felt to stale because of characters just talking and the only movement yo could see was that of their mouths. Character desings , were kind of cliche, and the one for Taiga feels like a direct rip off of Louise from Familiar of Zero. 
Sound: 5/10
The only reason why I think sound deserves 5 is because of the song ''Lost my Pieces'' that is the main theme of the show, such a beatiful song. There was another one that I liked a lot but can't remember it's name. The rest are just there to accompany the animation. I didn't like at all the openings and endings, but a lot of people like the first opening, not sure why.
Character: 7/10
This is another really dissapointing area of this show. In one hand you have this characters that feel like cookie - cutter characters, but then you see there is a extra, a twist to all of them. Taiga is your typical tsundere but also can be very childish, shy and a klutz. Minorin is your typical hyper, happy go lucky character, but also can become extremely angry (and frightening) or just aggresive. The rest of characters have similar characterizations, which is good, because they felt kind of realistic. The problem is that , except for the blue haired bitch and Taiga, characters don't develope that much. I wish I could have seen more of Minorin, she was by far my favourite character (strange thing since I usually hate her kind of character) and it was doing a great job during episode 3 that was more focused on her (my personal favourite episode) , but after that she is mostly forgotten until way latter into the show.
What does develope however are the relations between characters, and this probably was the strongest point of the show. Take for instance Taiga and Ryuji, for the most part they stayed as friends, but not the kind of ''I wanna be with you but misunderstandings dont allow it'' friends. Both were in love with different people, and that was great to see how they supported each other as friends. Another relation I loved was the one of Ryuji and the blue haired bitch.
Enjoyment 7/10
I had a decent time watching this show, I mean I pretty much marathoned it, but except for some occasions , I never felt like it touched me emotionally, and hell, I cry with ease when it comes to storytelling.
Overall 6/10
It's a shame how the final product resulted, especially because you see the creator had a lot of good ideas, and even some excellent executions, but then wanted to force you to feel, force you to get emotional, and then is when it failed miserably. But as said , if you are a fan of romantic comedies, then you will enjoy this one for sure.",6
"
                Despite the popularity of the series, Toradora brings nothing except show the pitiful state of many shounen romances. In order to appeal to its target audience, the first 16 episodes rely on fan service and cheap plot devices to carry the story rather than have an engaging plot. In these episodes, only one character, Ami, undergoes any real growth, changing from an arrogant snob to developing close friendships to those around her. For everyone else, life changing events occur, and immediately afterwards, the plot and character interactions seemingly pretend they never happened. Somehow, despite such a painful start, the following episodes create an engaging story
                  with compelling characters only to lead to a comically bad ending. The last two episodes completely ignore Ryuji's family dynamic up until that point, and feels childish even considering how immature the leads are. Once they've committed to their out-of-character decision, the story effectively tries to undo this, and Taiga completely ignores everything we've been shown about her personality to end the story. If Toradora is truly one of the best anime romcoms, the bar is below ground. Fortunately, there's many better alternatives, even if the target audience has never heard of them.
That said, the series has redeeming qualities: for the final third of the series, there's an excellent story and character arcs that almost comes to fruition. Ami's arc is well-written and her characterization is compelling throughout the entirety of the series. If only the rest of the characters could have as much depth as her. Although Toradora may be bad, there's excellent pieces that could lead to creating an excellent story from its premise. Hopefully we'll see a reboot where this ""what if"" actually becomes a reality.",4
"
                Being a high schooler is something that can only be described as one thing: confusing. Not only do you have to deal with the stresses of school work, social life, and family problems, but you also have to deal with raging hormones that only serve to make negative emotions stronger and spontaneous attractions to another person that you really can never be too sure about. 
Most slice-of-life high-school comedies I have seen so far were only comedies and were really light on the plot and lacked sustenance. The one thing I really liked about Toradora! is that it did have a solid plot and good
                  character development. More accurately put, Toradora! is a high-school comedy romance that involves two characters who develop and unlikely relationship to pursue their romantic interests. Ryuuji and Taiga first encounter each other in the most unusual (if not hilarious) circumstances and both create an alliance to help each other get with the others' romantic interest (which is coincidentally enough their best friends). As the series develops the two undoubtedly develop revelations that they were never aware of before. Facing inner demons of the past or battling with ambivalent feelings in the present, the two go through an adventure that all of us can relate to in one way or another.
The one aspect of high school attraction is that it's puppy love, most of the time we're just attracted to them for no reason at all. Most of us like someone during high school on a whim, despite the fact one person likes another, the two people could be in completely different worlds and have nothing in common. I know when I liked someone it wasn't because of their looks or their personality, I just liked them. Toradora! shows this characteristic through both Taiga and Ryuuji. Both protagonists like a certain someone not necessarily because deep personality or similarities with interests, but because of the raging hormones that cause random attraction. However, as the story progresses the two begin to realize there is more to actual love than simple attraction.
In short the series was excellent, it kept the laughs and could evoke some tears, but it was sweet all the way through.
Now for the review:
Story (8): Since this is my first romantic comedy, my impression of the series was highly positive, mainly because I'm used to watching plotless high-school series that just induce random laughs. The story itself was well executed. There were outcomes  that were extremely predictable. Yet, within those outcomes were surprises I would have never expected. They story was cute and very fun to watch. Lots of heartwarming scenes as well as sad scenes that really could make a few people cry.
Art (7): Simple, clean, and vigorous. Toradora! has enough detail to attract possible viewers with just aesthetics, but the art is simple enough so that certain emotions and feelings could be exaggerated throughout the series. The colors are bright and keep you awake throughout the series.
Sound (7): The OP and ED of the first half is upbeat and positive to emphasize the comedy part of Toradora! The BGM for those parts were good and served to aid in the overall delivery of the laughs attributed to the comedy scenes. However, what really impressed my is the more deep BGM's that really set the mood for the more serious scenes of Toradora! On top of this is the change in the OP and ED during the second half of the series. Although the songs are upbeat, they contrast to the first two songs used in that the second half OP & ED were slower and clean and had more meaning to the lyrics. I have high praise for the music as well as the seiyuu's who really did a great job in their roles. Taiga's cute, ""dere"" voice was so adorable in contrast to her sarcastic and angry one! Props to Rie on a job well done.
Character (9): The character development within the series was something predictable, yet I always like to see the development because sometimes I'm able to learn a thing or two by watching the characters develop and face problems that I might have. I was able to relate to the characters so much in terms of relationships, yet I must say that the impulsiveness that comes out of those relationships is apparent, and strike a sense of unrealistic setting since most things don't work out the way we want them to. I liked the characters. From the scary-faced, yet kind-hearted Ryuuji, to the fiesty, yet sensitive Taiga. One character that I really liked was Ami. She was almost like a self-aware foil to all the characters. Ami picks up on even the slightest details which reveal something about another character that that character doesn't even realize. I think the creator of Toradora! was a genius for putting Ami in because it gave us an ""adult"" perspective of what was going on in the story when there was no proper ""adult"" in the story who knew the other characters intimately well. Ami reminds me of my parents, who are able to pick up on certain actions and speech patterns I have that give away something I don't even realize. Yet, they do actively help me in the background rather than simply hinting at the issue like Ami does. Ah, I'm getting off topic! Simply put, I loved that cast of Toradora!
Enjoyment (8): Not much more to say about enjoyment. Characters are well developed and their interactions are fairly human. The music and seiyuu's were both very desirable. Art was clean yet simple. The story is just an awesome romantic comedy! If I said anything more I would be a broken record!
Overall (8): Toradora! is a fresh series that any new or veteran anime fan would enjoy. It has an enjoyable plot and a colorful cast that everyone could relate to. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy themselves in the simple, yet cute story of high school teens and love.",8
"
                This anime is AMAZING. I usually don't spend time to write reviews (as I'm not that great at them), but I felt Toradora deserves a review. Toradora is probably my favorite anime of all time. Toradora is very emotional, yet funny. Very enjoyable to watch. Would recommend this anime to anyone. Definitely a must-watch!!

                Imagine building up for 19 episodes for something and without a warning or reason the writer ""plots-out"", does a 180 and takes the story into a different direction, very annoying right? Now add to that that the reason you kept going was that the characters, humor, story and romance all were holding the series together but that twist from before just turned everything upside down and the balance is completely gone. 
Free loader rich spoiled child meets a man servant next door and abuses of his good will whenever possible. This narcissistic girl has no issues with trampling all over people to get what she
                  wants but she always drops before getting it in favor of pursuing another goal. 
This is the no-story-dora. Then we have the off-screen-dora that is used by the writer to make things go a certain way even if it makes no sense or there's no reason for it. 
Romance wise is when the poo really hits the fan and every other character really shows their colors and oh boy they are really bad : cowards, backstabbers, manipulators and selfish ""good for nothing"" people, no one has a little bit of common sense and stop making stupid rash decisions that make no sense in the anime or IRL. 
The cherry on the poo cake is that the core cause of all this just decided to stop making everyone and everything awkward and still no other character is wise enough to make a move, they just stand and watch like the indecisive/goalless they are.
The writers also took the opportunity amidst the wreckage to pull the trigger on the 180.
The humor is good.
If you want to watch something similar but in 12 episodes and just enjoy a bumpy ride there are lots of romcoms out there that are pretty good in 12 episode format which are expected to have plot holes and inconsistencies since they only have 12 episodes to work with, aka, the season must be a full story but when you have 25 from the get go it is just poor planning.",3
"
                Why did this anime remind me so much of Clannad, with out the after story. Oh yah because all slice of life anime are all the same! Maybe i'm just being a bit to harsh because I really quite a few slice of life, perhaps it's just the high school slice of life genre I don't like. This story is about Ryuuji and Taiga falling in love with the wrong people and in the end realizing that they really love each other. Seem interesting? Well that's what 90% of slice of life is, a love story between a girl and a boy in high school
                  who eventually find out they're perfect for eachother and life is just peachy and fun. Of course there is a lot of drama in this show but most of it is forgettable as it didn't really compare much to Clannad After Story, which could perhaps be one of my favorite anime of all time. The main character Taiga is the most fun character in the show who at times will act crazy and angry and others act sweet and kind. Ryuuji is just another typical main character in a slice of life who is nicer than your average high schooler boy and tries to make Taiga as happy as possible, he even pretends to be santa for her at one point, which I found ridiculous. The other main characters in the show portray your typical cast in a slice of life, with different hair colors and personalities to distinguish them from other high schoolers. I felt like this show is just a little to overhyped, maybe I'm just becoming a evil person because I can't find joy in any of these love comedies anymore, in fact I found myself bumping my head several times while watching this anime because of how ridiculous it was at times. I think i'll stay away from the slice of life genre for a little bit and go to a new genre. Overall this anime wasn't terrible but at the same time it wasn't anything special, it was Okay. It had many similar reoccurring features that Clannad had, but without the after story.. and I guess it did make me a little happy in the end when Ryuuji and Taiga ""almost"" said they loved each other. That's another problem I had with this genre, these people rushed into getting married like it was nothing, I didn't really feel much romanticism between the two until the end. If you are a slice of life fan who loves ridiculous anime and love stories that almost go somewhere, by all means watch this show, you will love it!",6
"
                This was my first rom-com anime and, though I've tried to find one that might top it, I haven't had any luck. 
Story 9/10: The premise itself is already different from the typical rom-com premise, and it stays that way as it goes on, so much so that, even though it's a slice-of-life without incredible plot-twists, you never get bored and it never feels predictable. The only reason I decided to dock a point off this section was because of the ending, which wasn't horrible but it could've been better.
Art 10/10: The character designs take a bit of getting used to, and the art in
                  general is pretty average, but there are times when it looks absolutely incredible, and during such moments you can definitely see just how much work they put into it. Apart from those moments, I really love the backgrounds, which might not seem remarkable compared to other anime, but they work really well here.
Sound 10/10: I'd be tempted to dock a point because I don't really like a lot of the background music on its own, but the few tracks I do like more than make up for it, especially when coupled with the voice acting, which is generally solid, and sometimes mind-blowing.
Character 10/10: Honestly, I only love the two main characters. I've seen this anime three times so far and I still haven't really gotten attached to the three very prominent side-characters. They are definitely fleshed out and very good characters overall, but I personally just don't like them very much, especially Ami, who I might call mature if she wasn't so annoying most of the time. However, Taiga and Ryuuji both make up for that. They're definitely some of the best character I've ever seen in anime, both individually and together. Their unique dynamic is definitely the leading factor behind my love for this anime.
Enjoyment 10/10: The first time I watched it I fell in love with it in the first few minutes, and I marathoned it in two days, not knowing how empty I would feel when I finished it. I've seen it two more times since then, and it still manages to make laugh and cry at the appropriate moments. 
Overall 10/10: If there were more rom-coms like this, I'd definitely be a huge fan of the genre. As that's not the case, this would be my first recommendation to anyone looking for a good romance anime.",10
"
                It is sad, and it is happy. Its funny, emotional, and romance is done beautifully. It portraits uncertainty of youth and love in very touching, but also entertaining way.
I will not write about surface story. But about what is beneath that. It was story about love. It start with very naive picture of love, that kind that (~15)young people have. That you just see someone and you know that that is the person. Then it evolves throughout the first three fourts of series. It becomes story about self, self reflection, self sacrifice, happiness, future... Things that many self aware young people think about. Things that
                  I think about a lot. It develops both paths. Selfish/heart and more logical, but ironically selfless (You want good for more people that just you) path. We get taste of both of them, because every character has this internal struggle. The culmination of this was ""cession"" of ""Pink hair"" girl and then ""espace"" (heart) and ""seclusion"" (logick) of 2 MCs (""petite"" and ""Long boi""). These parts were very emotional, somehow sad but happy... simply just beautiful. It doesnt offer answers to your questions about love, of happiness ... but it beautifly depicts why and how you have them. Of course, storywise it had to end somehow. And it chooses the ""you must understand and accept yourself to be happy"" approach.
To sum it up: Great depiction of how meaning of love evolves, and how it gets complicated... Emotionally and allegorically beautiful. I really recommend to watch this after some harem ecchi anime to make yourself feel like human again.",9
"
                I finished this series a few months before I decided to make a Mal account.
I very much well enjoyed this anime from start to finish but the ending didn't strike me fancy.
It wasn't until episode 20 where i knew it wasn't going to have the ending i wanted, then again we almost always don't get what we want in some ways. (in anime anyway)
Visuals & Sound were astonishing as usual since it was Bd.
Art: Was extremely perfect in my taste, went perfect with the rest of the story.
I mainly watch anime for the artwork, great artwork usually (sometimes) comes with great story. (sometimes)
If your into romance com, drama, and huge massive cat fights this is the series for you! all in all 9/10 :D",9
"
                Out of all of the romances I have seen after Toradora! I have yet to find one that is so stereotypical but so well done at the same time. Initially the characters were the types that I couldn't stand, bland guy with a partially weird personality, popular smart student council archetype, tsundere, and perfect yet stupid best friend. 
Then when a straight up b**** was introduced just as the Taiga/Ryuuji ship had sailed (personally) I was considering giving the show up entirely. But, that's when our characters also started breaking their own stereotypes. As if this negative character in their rose colored high school life
                  was bringing out a much more human response.
If there are two things that I appreciate the most about the show, that ran all the way through, they are the characters (in the second half, mostly) and the music. The characters, as I said, become very human. Which is something that I love to watch, they understand each other in ways that usually none of the other characters in any romance are able to. That doesn't help that none of them are able to admit their feelings for one another (nothing new there)
Overall, I'm scoring Toradora! a 10 for the way that it affected me. 
*Spoiler?*
The ending is bittersweet, to say the least. I can't help but admit that I was disappointed at the end of the day. I wanted to see more, as I'm sure most people also agree with that. But, it's left us with the thoughts that these two had a future, it was nothing more but an assurance that they were together and it's unlikely that they'll leave each other again",9
"
                Toradora, probably the best romance anime i've ever watched. Let's check it out.
Story: 5
Well, there isn't a real plot in Toradora actually. It's just a typical high-school slice of life, with its typical chapters and arcs (pool, cultural festival, christmas, valentine's day...), but how the story is greatly developed completely belongs to the characters. This anime is fully about bonds and relationships between the characters, and it wouldn't be fair if I consider this as a plot thing.
Art: 7
Toradora has been animated by J.C Staff studio in 2008, and I can say that is a very good work. The animation flows smoothly and the ""fight""
                  scenes are gorgeus. It is well directed and shows everything it wants to show. Nothing wrong with the animation.
Sound: 8
Toradora's soundtrack is quite average: it does not mind, but neither stands out especially. HOWEVER, there is one track. A track called ""Lost my Pieces"". And oh god, it's absolutely beautiful. This one doesn't sound that much during the series, BUT ALWAYS AT THE RIGHT TIME. How this soundtrack is used brilliantly, besides the OPs (Pre-Parade and Silky Love, Pre-parade especially stands out) and the ED (both very good), is what makes this anime sound good as hell.
Character: 10
Toradora's strongest point. As I said before, this anime is fully about characters and their relationship. All its characters are well characterized and developed. For example, You can think ""oh, Taiga is so much tsundere, same shit again"". However, Taiga evolves a LOT through the series, you can feel her pain, and Kushieda's too. Kushieda is probably the best character in the series (best doesn't mean favourite xD). She hides a lot of things under her mask and you wanna discover it. Ryuuji is also a good character, with fears and insecurities, one of the few MC you can really trust. Kawashima is a bit underated, but she's the common sense of the series, though is a bitch xD. Even Kitamura is enyoyable, while anyone look to him.
The relationships between them are complicated and deep, and toradora manages them perfectly. it's an ode to well-constructed characters.
Enjoyment: 9
I first watched this anime in one day, that says everithing. Surely it has its flaws, like ignoring the obvious, delay the plot, some deus ex machina scenes, or how sometimes male characters are not aware of anything, besides being not funny at all. But you can go through with any problems, even if you are not a romance fan, like me.
Overall: 8
Toradora is is a tender and pleasant anime. It's the difference between liking someone and to love someone, and is credible and natural, no need to preach that love is the force that moves the universe.
""Should I watch this anime?"" Well, as I said, yes. Go now.
If you liked Toradora, take a look to:
-Clannad, and especially Clannad: After Story, romance is better in Toradora but Clannad is funnier and more dramatic.",8
"
                Toradora! may be a high-school romance comedy, but deep down, it is a story about friendship, family and just being true to one's self. This series is still my favourite of all time, but I will try to write this review without making it sound like a sales pitch...
 10/10
Unlike many romance series that has came before it or since, the challenges that arose in the plot did not feel forced. The character interactions felt natural as well. Yes, a series on high-school romance is nothing new, but the execution of the series is still among one of the best I have seen so far.
                  The pacing was perfect for majority of the series and the transition between comedy and drama was near flawless.
 9/10
Let's be frank - the character face designs were unusual, and very different compared to the light novel series and manga. In fact, Ryuji was just plain ugly. That was really the only flaw I could think off. The animation was fluid, the background details were amazing and some scenes was truly exceptional. Giving away more detail would be a spoiler so I'll cut it short there.
 10/10
The sounds was probably one of the standouts of this series. The upbeat techno beats in the comedy scenes, the beautiful acoustic guitar riffs in the more emotional scenes, the clever use of the ED in episodes where more screen time on the characters was required - everything was just perfect.
 10/10
As good as the sound was, the true gem was the characters of the show. Firstly we have our two main characters (Taiga and Ryuji), who despite their tough exterior are very caring people on the inside. Then we have Minori and Kitamura - two popular students with very eccentric personalities who tries to hide their personal problems. Finally we have Ami to round out the main cast - a girl who fears people knowing the real her and puts up an act instead. Each of these characters have issues which can be related to, and the background story of the characters on how they got the way they are now is also believable and does not provoke a facepalm reaction - something that is very rare in anime these days. In addition to that, this group has a lot of chemistry. It really gave off the sense that this group consists of very close friends who would do anything for each other, and that overall is a standout for me.
 10/10
While not quite the rollercoaster ride which Clannad:Afterstory was (I'm comparing the two as they both aired during the same season), this series still strapped us in and took us for a ride. I honestly felt watching this series that I got to know the characters so well, that it was almost as if I was the sixth member of the main cast. Add in the art and sound, and this series has yet to bore me (I've already rewatched about 5 times by now).
 10/10
Since Toradora, there has been anime with much more beautiful art, but better sounds and of course, but better plots. However, for me it is the characters which makes a show stand out, and for me, Toradora has the best cast of characters I had ever seen. Each character was lovable, the challenges they faced were believable and most of all, the chemistry between this group of friends is something very special.",10
"
                This review contains minor spoilers.
When I was in high school, I had a huge crush on a girl for years.  She was a talented singer with long red hair.  I was obsessed with this girl, and had put her on a high pedestal.  But I never really knew her very well; I had a hard time talking naturally with her, and our friendship, such as it was, was incredibly awkward.
Needless to say, my feelings were never reciprocated, and nothing ever happened with her.  
Things were different with the girl I eventually married; we were close friends for years, and were comfortable
                  talking to each other about anything and everything, including crushes.  We spent tons of time together, talking to each other and just enjoying each other's company, and eventually that developed into real love, based on real trust and real companionship.
This is what Toradora captures so clearly.  The main characters, Taiga and Ryuuji, each have crushes on each other's best friend; upon discovering this, they embark on what quickly becomes a close and comfortable friendship, as each still pines after their unrequited crush.  What the show makes clear from the first episode, but they don't realize until much later, is that the person who matters most is already right in front of them.
Each of the major characters in Toradora--not just Ryuuji and Taiga, but also their friends--are well-developed, with strengths and flaws and a clear thematic link between all of them relating to the way they handle hardship, which in each case is some variation of retreat, of refusing to face it head-on.
It's the characterization which makes this show very, very good.  Each character has a clearly demarcated story arc, and each has changed for the better by the time the series reaches its conclusion.
None of them illustrate this as clearly as Taiga, who at first glance seems like a stereotypical tsundere type, but who breaks the conventions of the trope in several key ways and by the end of the show behaves in ways which would make her almost unrecognizable if they happened in the first few episodes.  And yet her development is so judiciously meted out, and stems so much from her interactions with others and from decisions we see her make for herself, that it's fully believable when she becomes so much more mature by the show's ending.
The other characters change too--not as dramatically, but in meaningful ways.  Because this isn't just a show about what it means to love somebody, it's also a coming-of-age story, and a very good one.
Toradora isn't perfect.  While the characterization is excellent, and the story is very good, sometimes the absurd and slapstick humor goes a little too far for my taste.  It's always tough to reconcile the entertainment factor with the serious elements of a romantic comedy like this; how seriously do you take Taiga basically beating the crap out of Ryuuji, for instance?  If it was live action, it'd be an abusive relationship--but it's an anime, and it's an expected trope and part of the show's sense of humor.
There might also be a touch of the Mary Sue going on with Ryuuji, with multiple girls all falling for him, despite that he's depicted as a bit of a nerdy homebody with odd interests.  My rule of thumb for avoiding that issue is that no more than two people should fall in love with the main character.  Any time a protagonist has 3+ people all crushing on him or her, I lose a little of my suspension of disbelief.  This is a minor problem with Toradora, but it is something which bugged me a bit.
The animation is overall quite good, but the character designs I felt were just okay.  Taiga's ""palm-top tiger"" proportions are very exaggerated, and it makes her distinctive, but it also makes her look a little odd.  All of the female character designs felt a little bit weak to me, and notably Ami and the Student Council President look much too similar in silhouette and color choices.  I thought the artists did a better job with the guys, though Ryuuji and Kitamura look a bit too similar from behind.
The Japanese voice acting, though, is amazing, especially Taiga's, which stole the show.  The music ranges from serviceable to excellent, with one track, Lost My Pieces, being deservedly beloved by fans of the series.
One of the best things about this series is that it has a satisfying, mostly unambiguous ending.  The final epilogue section during the credits could've been expanded upon and been a little bit stronger, but overall, this isn't a series you'll leave with a bad taste in your mouth, unlike certain romance series I won't call out here by name.
Toradora is a hard show to rate for me, though, because there are things I disliked about it from the very first episode.  Most of those things are relatively minor, but they add up.  At the same time, there are aspects of it which I absolutely love, and I think it's possibly the best exploration of youthful love I've seen in an anime.
So I'd unabashedly recommend watching it, but I'd caution prospective viewers that there are some aspects which may bug you if you have the same sensitivities as I do--but at the same time I'll state that they're entirely worth pushing through to get to the meat of what's really a fantastic story with great characters.

"
                In my opinion, I thought this was an amazing series. Even though it may have a cookie cutter aspect to it, they really did a great job with it. 
Story: The story kept me focused on the series as it progressed. With every cliffhanger I found myself pulling my hair and giving a ferocious battle-cry for more. As stated earlier, they did an amazing job with the cookie-cutter aspect of the love triangle (or rectangle for this matter..kind of) as they were able to make it appear fresh and new with each obstacle the main characters dealt with.
Characters: My first impression of Ryūji was that
                  he was going to be the double image of Seiji Sawamura from Midori no Hibi; due to his frightful appearance. But thankfully I was proven wrong and saw that he was quite the opposite in most cases, and that his actions and his very character were believable. I was entertained by Taiga's antics throughout the first season, but during the second half we were shown her true image, the one that's usually hidden behind her tough demeanor. The same goes for Kushieda as well. I originally thought she would just have a minor role in the whole series, like an action character used to give that extra nudge for something to happen. Over time we learned about her feelings and how committed and loyal she was to uphold the values of friendship.
Music: Overall I thought the music fit pretty well. I loved the openings and endings for both seasons as they provided an upbeat or anxious feeling depending on what season you're on.
Enjoyment/Overall: I loved it. I loved the story, the characters, and the fact that they gave the ending justice (in my opinion, because it most cases, romantic comedies have terrible endings). I'm a person who wants to see the two characters show their feelings for one another and share a kiss, and I'm glad to say that I wasn't let down otherwise I'd be throwing tables instead of writing this review. If you're into romance, comedy, and a good dash of drama then I would definitely recommend you to check this out. Hell, I'm a guy and I still felt like I was going to melt into putty during the last few episodes. You know an anime is good when you can make a man hold onto a pillow in anticipation. Good job!
Final Score: 10/10",10
"
                So I have just finished this series and I can say that I really enjoyed it. Sure, Toradora didn't have a complicated or dark story but there was still this need to carry on watching! Toradora did a great job at keeping me interested and I really think that you will love this series if you are into the romantic comedy genre in anime. The art in this anime was not the best but it did have its moments of really great scenes. I really loved the soundtrack especially the track lost my pieces because it just fit the moment so well and really actually
                  got me emotional! As for the first opening I enjoyed it and I really loved the energy and fun in the opening. The second opening was not as good as the first but it wasn't bad. The characters in Toradora are amazing! I liked the character development in this series. My favorite character was Taiga although she is a tsundere  character she is really cute and awesome and also very caring! I really loves this series because it was really funny and had some really touching moments in it! I do recommend that you watch this series even if you are not into its genre because Toradora was really great and I personally couldn't find anything wrong with it! This was my first review so sorry if it was bad !",9

                Toradora Review
For a shorter synopsis of my thoughts, see the summary/pros and cons below. This review is somewhat spoilery, but I made sure the details were vague.
Summary: 
Toradora is an magnificent high school rom com with great, well fleshed out characters dealing with love lives, personal baggage, regrets and many more issues adolescents and adults deal with. This anime, unlike many in it’s genre, takes full advantage of the character being in high school. Melodrama can be a double edge sword, but Toradora uses it effectively. The animation is generally good with a couple hiccups here and there. Soundtrack is decent with one track in
                  particular that is a massive standout. The story progresses very naturally so that romances end or blossom in such a way that it isn’t forced to make the ending work. Toradoras comedy is really funny, either when pushing familiar character troupes to their extremes and especially the eccentric personalities of just the character interactions themselves. It was emotionally charged and very enjoyable to watch and I’d definitely recommend this to those who are into high school rom coms and can handle melodrama. Overall: 9/10.
Pros:
+ Rich and very deep characterisation that subverts cliches and becomes much more expansive than the tropes they seemed to initially be
+ Witty and solid writing that managed to make character motivations make  perfect sense and all paced together naturally
+ Often hilarious character interactions, situations and dialogue 
+ Made excellent and creative use of the high school setting
+ Can be very emotionally moving and surprisingly mature at times, sneaking in good life lessons while not being preachy
+ Great voice acting performances
Cons: 
- Occasional animation slip ups
- Outside of a few tracks, a mostly forgettable soundtrack
Story:
Initially, the idea of the two main characters trying to set themselves up with the other side characters was something I latched onto, despite being fairly cliche. While it may be fairly easy to predict what will happen next, there is a great sense of nuance hidden underneath the melodrama which works to Toradoras advantage.The writing is excellent, as the comedy is often witty enough to stand on its own and establishes the characters very strongly in the viewer's mind. 
What is especially noteworthy here is how the writing handles character drama and development. Despite how immature characters can act at times, there are just as many scenes of surprisingly mature and heartfelt writing that helps build an emotional epicenter for Toradora to shine from. It handles growing up and dealing with heartbreak more effectively than many other romances I have seen. It’s also paced beautifully (for the most part), allowing a natural progression from beginning to end. 
Lastly, what I really appreciated in the story was how the seemingly right way to solve a friend’s dilemma can just make things worse and seem cowardly on the part of the one helping. Situations like these do come up in Toradora and help reinforce how mature and insightful the writing can be. Not everything will end up being what the characters wanted, but again, this is more relatable to how things play out in an actual high school. Overall: 8/10.
Characters:
Of all the things I liked about Toradora, what made me fall in love with it is its characters and just how deep they are. I feel like Toradora is one of the few to take full advantage of that awkward, heavily insecure time of high school and it expresses this with big, dramatic character moments as well has more subtle ones. 
Taiga Aisaka is the embodiment of tsundere, which could make for an annoying character. However, I argue she is easily the best character of the anime, despite being the most cliche. Of all the characters, she grows and matures the most. Example: In the first few episodes, we see many people cower in fear from her very presence. In later episodes, those people eventually stop being scared of her and want to be her friend. This happens because her classmates, like the viewer, saw her being scared and reminded them that she is still human. After a while, she starts being a little nicer to others and becomes much more approachable/likeable as a result. I also loved how, like many of the other characters, wasn’t overly mature and made her (and others) as realistic as possible.
Another point to consider is her transition between tsun and dere. There is the tsun (violent, temperamental) side, but the dere (affectionate, compassionate) side is what really makes her character so loveable. The second half of Toradora shows this beautifully, as she handles her own problems noticeably different from the rash ways she used to handle it. Deep down, Taiga Aisaka is a very caring, compassionate heroine. Evidence of this is how much she loves holidays and especially how far she is willing to go sometimes to make sure people are happy (even if she dislikes them). Taiga eventually learns a lot about herself by the end and what her heart truly wants.
Ryuji deals with a similar problem to Taiga: everyone is terrified of him. While Taiga fights her way through it, Ryuji truly takes a more passive approach. Initially, he is fairly bland but throughout the course of the anime, we see subtle hints about how he too matures and grows; Like how he starts to consider others feelings or becomes more honest (like Taiga) with what his heart truly wants.
What really perpetuated Ryuji into being a great and fleshed out character is a scene in which he pushes his own selfish desires onto someone else, while having good intentions. Many, including myself, are guilty of this and the way Toradora handled this and grew his character from it was exceptional; rather than falling into a self loathing trap and fending the person he hurt away, he immediately fought to gain this person’s trust and loyalty back. As with most anime protagonists in romances, he is rather kind and thoughtful. As a foil to Taiga, he works by showing how different, yet similar Ryuji and Taiga are. 
Kitamura and Kushieda both essentially suffer from the exact same dilemma: denial. Kushieda handles this by being as busy/active as possible. She tries to be considerate to her friends as it slowly eats away at her because she put her own aside. By taking on so much responsibility, she throws herself away from her own true desires. Later on in Toradora, her bottled up fears, emotions and frustrations end up hurting and affecting others. Despite her strong facade, Kushieda is rather immature, making it a fascinating contrast between Taiga’s increasing maturity to Kushieda own unraveling.
Kitamura is a little different. He too has his own responsibilities he hides under, but his character explores outside pressures of adolescent school students and how he copes with the usual heartache. Like Taiga to some degree, Kitamura is a people pleaser. He caves into peer pressure but by the end discovers that he needs to do what he wants to do. Even when confronted with heartbreak, he embraces it, yet doesn’t once feel bitter or sour over it. He tries his best to be content with what he has and enjoy the ride. Kitamura learns to embrace his failures and carry on despite any regrets he may have. To sum it up, Kushieda runs away from her desires by being as busy as possible while Kitamura tries to use certain jobs/clubs to help fulfill his own desires. 
While most people held contempt for Taiga, I had a bigger problem with Ami. Even though it’s a cliche, she is a true example of not judging based on initial impressions. Ami can be a good example for how nasty and fake some high school girls can act but she is also equally how mature they can be emotionally. 
Ami is similar to Hachiman from SNAFU. Both characters often try to help their friends out by doing acts that seem deplorable to her peers. What I love about Ami is how she is able to put her selfish desires aside for the benefit of her friends. She knows what everyone wants and tries her best to give it to them. Deep down, she is also just as scared and insecure as the rest of the main cast, yet will still put up a front. 
The characterization here is easily the greatest strength of Toradora. They made the characters likeable enough to get behind yet ground them emotionally perfectly to the age they were supposed to be.Overall: 9/10.
Animation:
I think the art/animation, while dated, still works really well. There are scenes in which it’s clear they cheaped out on (mostly in scenes of high action), but the art style and quality are relatively consistent. In the second half, it improved and started to shine more in scenes with heavier emotion and weight behind them. This is merely a visual aesthetic/personal thing, but I really like the overall art style of the characters. Overall: 7/10.
Sound:
The soundtrack is… decent for the most part. Admittedly, it is fairly standard but there’s a lot of life and energy given to each track, which often flows well with the upbeat comedy/romance genre. There are a couple standout tracks that I will mention. First, the openings and endings are all good. Most people like the first Opening the most and while I can see why, I personally LOVE the second opening. Not only is it an upbeat and enjoyable song on it’s own merit, the animation and song matches the more emotionally intense tone Toradora took in the second half. But more than anything, it pumps me the hell up for another episode. The other track I couldn’t NOT mention is the track Lost My Pieces. It plays during very emotionally heavy scenes and is a perfect accompaniment to characters falling apart at the seams. Every musical instrument and layer makes this song so emotionally powerful. The innocent music box playing a disheartened tune, the sorrowful and aching violins that sound like a heart being ripped apart, the piano trying frantically to keep everything together… everything about this track works. And as a result, it is easily one of my favourite OST’s of all time and can bring a tear to my eye. Overall: 8/10.
Enjoyment:
This is also an incredibly enjoyable anime to watch, given that you can stomach the dramatically heavy moments. The comedy here works wonderfully and I feel that the more melodramatic moments were handled with respect to the characters and flowed fantastically with the story and themes. The performances (regarding the sub) are fantastic. Each performance fits the character on screen so naturally that hearing other voices would likely throw me off (not disrespecting the dub, which seemed fairly competent). Overall: 9/10.",9

                Toradorable!!!
Story: 9/10 I liked how these two ""feared"" people become close friends. The Palmtop Taiga and the delinquent looking Ryuuji. :D Toradora was one of the anime with the most adorable and memorable moments of all time.
Art: 10/10 The art was beautiful because it was so unique compared to other anime. I really liked the facial expressions; I could really feel what the characters were feeling. I loved it! 
Sound: 10/10 The music was so moving. I really liked the opening theme; an exciting, upbeat song :)
Character: 10/10 I really liked how different this anime was, even though I could guess what would happen sometimes.
                  The uniqueness of the characters was amazing.
Enjoyment: 9/10 I really enjoyed those moments in Toradora that just made me smile. 
Overall: 9/10 I really wanted the series to be longer. I hate it when series just break off. In fact I really didn't understand the end of the last episode. I really wish that there was more in the relationship between Ryuuji and Taiga. But, I thought that the memorable moments made Toradora shine.",9
"
                There are plenty of reviews here trying to tell you everything you need to know, but if you need to know why you should specifically watch this show, look it up on YouTube.
Toradora is just a classic. The characters have their own distinct personalities that are likable. It may take you a bit to warm up to some of the characters but by the end you can appreciate each one of them.
It’s a classic rom-com that most people would enjoy. Coming from other rom-coms, I loved it. But, in general it’s a great story that’s not too cringe or over the top, just a feel
                  good anime anyone could enjoy, even if you don’t like rom-coms.
It definitely feels like a long show, and a lot of the development felt like it was at the end, which may be one of my only complaints. However, the show deserves a 10/10 as it is as close to a “Masterpiece” as most anime can get, and not many shows are as iconic as Toradora. The characters are great, the plot is interesting and fun as it progresses; I never felt bored.

                Toradora! is my all time favourite anime. I honestly love this anime because to me, it shows that the people you love are actually right in front of you. PLUS the plots amazing. I also love how theres a bit of tsundere into the anime xD plus how a person puts a facade on, helping other people when it's actually hurting him/her on the inside. This is basically a romance shojo that I think guys and girls would really love because it keeps you intriuged til' the very end. Maybe thats me coz I've recently started watching anime xD BUT I would 100% reccomend this
                  for anyone. This anime made me cry so much at the end because you could feel what the characters are feeling, by the sound and tone of their voices. I hope this review helps :3 and Im not sure if Im doing this review thing right coz this is my first time xD ty for reading ^.^",10
"
                After the first few Anime's I've seen the story was different from what I've seen.
Something I've experienced a lot actually.
It's about a girl and a boy who awkwardly started to know each other and have feelings for each other's best friend.
With that said, you might already know how it will end, I thought that too. 
Slap in my face, I was so wrong that I even felt how these characters felt. I felt hurt! (Sounds very unmanly, excuse me)
However, this was the first anime that I've felt that way and I'm glad I've watched it. I loved every bit of it and I hope everyone
                  else will too.

                I really don't usually advocate for Romance/Slice of Life animes, but this one blew it out of the water. It took nearly a year for me to finish watching this after picking it up not long before summer of last year. I was able to binge through around 9 episodes in one day but then found myself unable to watch it anymore due to issues regarding my computer/phone.
 Once I picked it back up a few days ago, I couldn't stop. I was up every night from 11-2 am watching and watching and eventually falling asleep and having to re-watch the last episode that I
                  passed out on. The show in no means put me to sleep, and did just the contrary. This show made me feel real emotions based on real life experiences and made me feel so connected to the problems the characters in the story were facing. Although this account is new, I have watched dozens of animes and can say with pride this show is the best I have watched so far with a large margin behind it being Re:Zero, or Fate/Stay Night. 
I love Toradora! and everything about it. It was able to deliver stunning visuals, while remaining simple and lovable. The plot of the story gave more than a reason to watch but a reason for me to re-watch in the future. The music and sound track is amazing, and the OP for the first half of the season is just breathtaking (although I do like the second half's OP as well but not as much) It has lovable, and very relatable characters that make you feel things you'd never expect an Anime to do. The enjoyment was vast, and I can't, and won't be able to help myself from watching again with others or even by myself. 
Over all I rate it 10/10 ( Whilst giving the art an 8 because I have seen shows with much more exaggerated scenes, but this show didn't need them as much) I love the show and highly recommend it to anyone willing to pick up a few hours of a emotional roller-coaster",10
"
                The complexity of human relationship and its back and forth it's well represented in Toradora. 
The simplicity of the story, set in a normal high school with normal characters, is the necessary stage to the complex development of characters such as Ryuuji, Taiga, Kitamura, Kushieda and Ami. 
The best thing about this anime is definetly the characters and their interactions based on their qualities and their flaws. 
The anime also balances the doses of comedy and drama, with great moments to both of these aspects, and scenes that will definetly break your heart and make you really feel the emotions the characters are transmiting. 
In
                  the overall aspect, Toradora is a great anime.",9
"
                So Toradora a story about some tall dude who thanks to his genes has a menacing look and people are afraid of him. Oh wait on Ep 2 they already get rid of that plot point and they sometimes mention it well ok.
So Toradora is a story about a tall dude and a short girl helping each other impress their crush.
Oh wait its just about Taiga... because Riuji is too much of a coward to ever do anything.
So Toradora is an story about this tall girl who gets constantly bullied and phisically abused by a little kid and she is too pathetic to fight back
                  or stand up, she also is awfully nice to this shitty kid for no good reason and she cooks for him (the cleaning part is properly explained so cant complain about that). Oh wait this pathetic girl who has been trashed around for the entire show realizes that she likes this shitty kid (its not an spoiler its on the tittle) who is an asshole because plot.
Does it sound off? Well thats Toradora if we were to reverse genders. Now hear me out im no SJW or feminist or any of those crazy person that screams equality but god dang if Toradora isnt stupid to watch.
Since i'm a man, im inclined to root for Riuji but he is such a little bitch when it comes to romance or proper human interaction or helping out others (hey look they are violently phisically and morally abusing your crush what you gonna do about it? Nothing? You are just going to watch as multiple people abuse of her? Ah ok).
So lets end this because im sick of Toradora already and i knew that i had to drop around ep 16 or 17 where my score for this show was around a 7 or 8.
Story: I might be a little fresh on romance and i might start already hating a genre that rely on a shitty gimmic and crappy tropes again and again.
All of this that gets enhanced because of the anime as a platform for the show.
But i just cant stand and be shown a girl slowly extending a flower (good story) to me (the viewer) to pick it up just for her to wink and start all over again.
This ""restart"" of the story is terrible on Toradora because the story seems to not be aware that its esentially restarting the story. Shows like Re:Zero use the ""restart"" (duh) as a plot point and the way to tell the story and it works because the story is fully aware of what its doing.
Toradora keeps abusing of the ""restart"" mechanic and hopes that our normie anime watcher mind forgets any development and just keep enjoying some wicked toxic eternal ride.
So you have the ""restart"" mechanic of slice of lifes paired with the obnoxiously slow and annoying anime romance... surely Toradora is a show that is better than the sum of its awful components. Yeah well no.
The story in Toradora is slow and annoying. Every time a confession is thrown around they just go like ""Yeah it didnt happened"" when the plot dictates it and this is lazy because its also picky as some confessions do actually impact the story and others not.
Whenever Taiga confesses her next confessions just lose more and more power because us as a viewer (if we arent mental) feel less and less shocked and moved by them (or at least we should but looking at the score and reviews its obvious that's not the case).
The story sometimes seem realistic but then it crashes with our toxic and unrealistic cast of  characters then it just falls flat on its face unable to keep moving forward.
And when the story does that, the viewer that is actually looking forward a well tought and written story fall flat on their face as well.
Toradora is pathetic when it comes to telling a love story or just a story but most of the time its because of its horrible toxic cast of characters.
Characters: I could rant for hours about the toxicity and the unmorality of these characters so i'll try not to.
If we look and value these characters for their entertaining factor then they are trash because they are incredibly toxic and you hope everyone dies tragically on a fire.
If we value these characters trough criticism and a more technicall view then they are still garbage but not as infuriating.
At first i tought that the characters in Toradora were just simply missunderstood, shy or undecisive (hell they are teens... oh wait just barely). But as more and more episodes were going down i realized that these characters were just trash.
Minorin never gets enough flak for being obnoxious, loud, violent, manipulative and most of the time a major pain in the ass.
She never works as a romantic interest because she is not charming on any way. This isnt a negative factor because it properly shows romance realistically as we sometimes see some dude falling for a girl while you scratch your head furiously trying to realize what the hell is going trough his head.
But Minorin avoids this. Is not like you werent understanding her persona and her motivations.
Is just that her persona and motivations are toxic, trash and oppresive.
Up until the end she is always the same and thats bad because her start is terrible.
She is a bad joke that keeps getting repeated again and again. When the story tries to make her go out of her usual mold of behaviours it is terrible because she doesnt just simply break character, she obliterates her character (bonus points for phisically and morally abusing people n.n).
If you ever get to meet someone like Minorin in real life please run away i beg of you.
Kitamura. The male romance interest or a less obnoxious Minorin (Ugh i would have killed for Kitahara to be replacing Minori...).
Thanks to an small screen time and the lack of proper conversation scenes we never get to figure Kitamura. Sure he is quirky and all of that but he holds no real weight on the story and could have been replaced with a cardboard and nothing would have changed.
Amin is straight up carbon copied from other animes. There isnt a single piece of originality on her character. This is thankfully forgiven to the fact that she holds absolutely no weight on the story. Even if she wanted there is no way she can move the story, not even an inch.
Her first episodes while cliche are not bad and you would think that her character would revolve around maturing and becoming a better person but she just makes criptical and annoying comments here and there. Like a naggy viewer that does nothing but criticize but never tells a way to fix the shitty story (holy shit Amin is me as a viewer).
So since the cast of side characters are either human garbage or just an unimportant cardboard then the weight of the show fall into our main cast of characters.
Tiger (more like dragon) and dragon (more like a dumb puppy...).
Taiga is the starchild of the show and she is cute and small so why the hell would we want to change anything of her? That would upset her hivemind of fans!
Taiga has a ton of potential that is simply not used. She starts as an horrible person and the show ends with her being almost the same horrible person.
Dwelving more into her character is meaningless. Anyone with a bunch of working brain cells knows that no one should ever act like Tiger because the world will never bend to their complaining. She is like a crying baby that didnt get her favourite sweet bought and the anime is the father that will always bend over and get her sweet rinse and repeat. 
Someone wants to annoy Taiga? Better throw sakuga here and there to add a ton of impact to these scenes and make the viewer see this incredibly violent display and forcing them to side with Taiga who 90% of the time is in the wrong. But Taiga is small and cute so how could she be wrong?
Riuji is probably the Hercules of this show at least on the first episodes. He cooks, he cleans, he's tall and has the badass looks (oh wait we are going to ignore this on ep 2 already? oh ok) while also being kind as hell who wouldnt like him?
Then the realization hits. His kindness loses its conceivability.
And thats bad dude! If the major aspect of his character (major? Ugh it might be his only saving feature if we dwelve enough into his mindset) is not charming then what will we do?
Should we make him develop something? Should we make him start being less stupid and coward? Nah just make him throw even more kindness for no good reason.
And this is the problem with Riuji. He is a water well. He is on the story to please the other characters and when he fails to do it (and he fails a lot) then we realize that he is inmature as hell and his mask of good will is ment to hide the fact that he is incredibly unidimensional.
They are all a disgusting bunch. Oh yeah and Minorin phisically and morally abuses of her best friend in front of the most important persons on her life dont ever forget that because that happens.
Art and sound: Yeah i guess they are fine but they get overshadowed by a terrible toxic cast of characters along a sloppy slow and dumb story filled with ""because the plot said so"".
Enjoyment: Ah... yes... The saving factor. The 50/50 on the ballet of books and animes (or movies or whatever). Even if the characters on some books like Plop are absolute waste of oxigen the book might be good because its entertaining right?
It doesnt matter if everyone in Toradora (except Inko chan) is a toxic piece of shit as long as the story as a whole is a good experience that leaves a good taste in your mouth!
Well... the product as a whole is honestly really good. Is enjoyable and its comedical elements alongside its slice of life moments are well done.
I can say that purely from an entertaining factor i could go as far as saying i did liked Toradora.
That's the reason i had the show so highly rated up to the 18 or 17 episode (and damn if i should have dropped while it was good!). The ride as a whole is truly enjoyable even if its cast is human waste and the story is rubbish
Final veredict: With an insulting cast of characters that shows what you Dont! have to do in real life instead of leaving some teaching or a moral to be learned from Toradora stands up as a lot of things but a love story (yeah there is never explained why Dragon likes what he likes) failing its most basic point when telling a love story: Explaining why the lovers like each other.
So if Toradora isnt a well written romance then its a slice of life with romantic elements?
No, the romance fills the screen 70% of the time.
A show that shows us that you dont have to mature and/or become a better person and just look for some loser that blindly worships and takes care of your every need because there is no sane person on the world aside from probably your parents and him that will ever want to do something like that.
A show that proves again and again that it doesnt matter if you are a horrible person as long as you feel that the world is against you then you can keep being a vortex of happyness, money and good will to those around you that for some god knows reason care about your pathetic ass.
A show that is scared of ever showing a guy standing up or being a man because that would be sexist and opressive because males are stronger than women so under no circumstance a men should ever touch a woman.
Which wouldnt be a terrible moral if the opposite applied. But Toradora is not equal.
Toradora is an anime and therefore guys must be trashed around and beaten up constantly because that's somehow funny and dont worry everything will go good in the end because this is anime.
Truly a disgusting, toxic and sometimes realistic portrayal of romance and high school that i highly encourage to people to watch.
If you like it, if you hate it, if its unfair, if its inmature, if its stupid, if its pretentious, if its sexist, if its infuriating... it doesnt matter in the end as long as you are Taiga.",2
"
                The story in this anime is AMAZING
Even though the first 5-10 episodes, i found, weren't that mind capturing, if you bare through it, the story line acutally gets REALLY REALLY good.
This anime is full of romance and comedy. Its like one of those dramas that makes you feel really really sad.
So i would recommend this to people who would enjoy a really good story and bare through like 5 episodes
              ",10
"
                This is my first written review ever.
Toradora is part of a light novel series meaning it's meant to target a young demographic in this case middle-school and high-school students.
The story of Toradora is centered around high-school romance with comedic elements in between. I found the humor of this anime to be kind of boring in the sense of it just being mildly funny. Ironically enough the shortcomings of this anime were also it's strong points and a reason why this didn't personally appeal to me as much as it seems to do so to other people.
Instead of this anime being fast paced and humorous like
                  one of my favorite anime (Angel Beats) it takes a slower paced approach with subtle hints of which characters like who. The thrill of this anime is watching how the events unfold and how the story is going to wrap up instead of unexpectedly being surprised where things are going to lead. This creates a reliance of execution instead of surprise.
Toradora is the 3rd romantic any I have seen aside from Angel Beats and Welcome to the NHK. While it was enjoyable, due to it's lack of ""hook"" and it being unnecessarily long, I would rate Toradora as the lowest tier of the 3 romantic anime I have seen.
I think the story was not only predictable but blatantly obvious. The art and character development was good, I liked how well it was portrayed that Ryuji had an affinity for cleaning things, how Taiga was portrayed as being lazy and somewhat unmotivated, and the characters were pretty well fleshed out with personality traits that made most of them feel real (especially Ryuji). In terms of sound the track was alright, there was xylophone produced track that got pretty repetitive after a while whenever dramatic moments happened. I watched the dub version of this anime and whoever voiced Taiga really stole the show! The other characters weren't noticeably bad dubs, they all seemed good enough.
My enjoyment level of this anime was good. The thing that separates masterpieces to things that are just good is how re-watchable or unforgettable the experience is. Toradora isn't something I'll forget or stop thinking about shortly, but eventually, and it's not something I would enjoy watching again. This anime is not masterpiece but just good, falling short of being more fleshed out it's romantic genre that it's supposed be. While it's subtlety and slow pace wasn't my cup of tea but it was definitely intended.
Overall I rate Toradora as being a 7 out of 10, marking it as a good anime but not a great one.",7
"
                When you ask someone ""What is the anime that has made you like anime?"", many will answer ""Naruto"" or ""Bleach"", but I would answer ""Toradora"".
   Why? It's simple: before ""Toradora"" I used to think that all anime were battle shonens with big-breasted girls, however, ""Toradora"", with it's down-to-earth and beautiful story showed me that the anime industry has much more to offer.
    The animation , even though everybbody criticizes J.C. Staff, was amazing, the songs fitted the show perfectly ( even if I have found "" My Silky Love"" a bit annoying) and the story, despite being
                  previsible and somewhat cliché, is well executed and has genuinelly funny and touching moments. However, what truly excels in the series are it's characters.
     ""Toradora"" charaters, unlike in  many other shows, are multi-dimensioned and complex. Ami and Minorin start off as "" the alpha bitch"" and ""the comic relief"" respectively, but later show much more personality than that. Ryuji and Taiga's relationship is developed slowly and realistically, but their individual character development isn't only associated with romance. We see both grow as people.
      Overall, I highly recommend ""Toradora"": it's an enjoyable romantic comedy that also provides serious moments and likeable characters. And it's hard to not cry in the final episode.
        P.S: Sorry for my grammar mistakes., I'm not a native speaker.",9
"
                Toradora is not your typical boy-meets girl rom-com,rather it is a lighthearted and funny comedy, yet it still conveys so much emotion because it has relateable characters. And those characters are in situation that the audience can relate to. That is of course falling in love or having a crush on someone, yet unable to ""confess"" or explain their feelings. Toradora comes with bundles of laughs in every episodes and I found myself watching episode after episode. 
The story:
Toradora at first glace seems like a story you've heard thousands of times, but it goes so much deeper than what I had expected. Without giving too
                  much away, Toradora is a lighthearted, funny, and emotional experience. The main characters form bonds and have interesting and funny misunderstandings, as well as conversations. Toradora is an enjoyable rom-com and the story helps drive that enjoyment.
8/10
The art and sound:
I'm not very picky with the art or sound, but both help set the mood and make for an enjoyable experience. As far as my opinion goes both do what they're suppose to do and don't overshadow the story or characters.
8/10
The characters:
This is the main draw for Toradora. Each main character is unique and different from any other anime I've seen, from their looks to their personalities. The bonds that these characters create add to the story and really drive the story to what it is. These characters are really the star of the show.
10/10
Overall I would highly recommend watching Toradora. It provides a lighthearted, funny, but different rom-com. From the character development, to the artwork, sound, and story, everything presented in Toradora is a plus.

"
                Potential spoilers at the last paragraph of the review.
Toradora! Alright. Well, to start things off, this show is actually good, I'm surprised. If you like comedy/romance that just does things right, this is for you. Toradora! is a sneaky series that incorporates all production elements to create a cohesive work that pushes the audience to where it needs to be. I think it also deserves praise for how nuanced and understated many interactions are. God is in the details. And too often in anime, we have a situation where all emotional go over the top. Toradora! says there's more than one way to do things.
                  With that being said, let's get into it. 
Story: 9
Toradora! is about a group of friends working through their 2nd year of high school, with all the romantic woes and drama that comes with it. It focuses on Ryuji and Taigi. In terms of plot, there isn't a strong sequence of events that really ties the series together, but that's OK. Hell, it's accurate. That's how high school is. You're riding the ride of life and special things happen, but you don't dwell on the structured events of your past for too long. This would normally make it difficult for the audience to retain interest: no connecting plot threads means that often the audience has nothing to look forward to. Toradora! recognizes this potential problem and stops it before it can begin by using the developing relationships between their characters as waypoints. At most any point between episodes, the friend group is either starting to go/do something special, or there has been a major development between characters that the audience wants to see come to light. It generates constant forward momentum without really disturbing what is natural about high school or blowing the stakes out of proportion. 
There are other aspects that are worth talking about, but in the end, they are too spoiler heavy so I'll just float over it. The structured events in the plot often act in ways that change the audience's perception of the characters so that the audience's expectations match up with development between the characters. The best example of this is what happens with Taiga around Christmas time. Also, plot threads that could seem random tend to be hinted at beforehand, so that some kind of development in that area seems expected. What it boils down to is that Toradora! has a strong plot where it always feels like something important is happening. 
You can kind of tell what the ending will be from the beginning just based on promo material and the way the stage is set up, so I would've liked to see something a little more surprising. But the way things happen is engaging and unexpected, so it is always exciting.
Art: 9
When I was looking at the promo material for this series, the art style sort of irked me, and I was expecting it to be a point of pain for me as I progressed through the series. I could not have been more wrong. The style looks totally fine in the series. More than fine, it is completely fitting of a relaxed romance/comedy series. Just like the tone of the series, the art style is often soft, delicate, and understated. But at the same time, it is dynamic. The artists often change characters to allow for a large range of expression, which is totally in line with the goal of the series.
The art also has no problems going outside of its comfort zone. I watched Tokyo Ghoul and Mirai Nikki before this since I am doing a rundown of the MAL popular page. Honestly, this has way better action scenes than the both of them. The action has punch, is extremely well paced, and contrasts well with the rest of the series. 
I had very few complaints as far as art is concerned. Very little use of CGI, and most of it is pretty tasteful. I will say that, for some reason, Kawashima's character gets flubbed a little from time to time. Not really sure why, and it's a shame because she is supposed to be the pretty one.
Sound: 8
Nothing crazy to talk about here. The OP/EDs range from decent to forgettable, but they are used well in the series, where they are always set up so that they make an impact at the perfect time. The opening panel of OP2 specifically with a quick scroll up on Taiga is often shocking/satisfying in the context of the previous scene. I will say that the mixing and ambient sound effects are very well done. Sometimes the scores feel a little stale, but it is easy to ignore that.
Character: 10
Hey, it's the focal point. In any romance/drama series, the quality, relatability, and depth of the characters is paramount. Toradora! does really well. There is a good reason for this. The cast is extremely tight. There are really 5 characters that the show wants you to care about, and they are together all the time. That makes it much easier to have these characters progress in their relationships. There are other side characters that are somewhat entertaining but are usually used to slightly push the plot and maybe provide a foil of what is happening to the main group. The characters are 
Kushieda and Kawashima, in particular, are great characters. Kawashima is a great take on a villain, where it is very easy to dislike her for how she treats her peers. But you come to realize that she has good reasons for doing what she does, and is very in touch with what people want due to a more mature lens. The way she bullies people also seems insanely real. Like it is exactly what the popular schoolgirl bully would do, but in an even more mature and understanding way. She fills a complex role in the story very well. She also just creates a lot of momentum in the plot. 
The development in each character is well executed, but also very subtle. You could craft a sentence that summarizes how each character has changed over the course of the series, and those sentences could seem very small and minor, but that's what makes it so real. 
I also wish we saw a little more of Kitamura: he is a fun and deep character that could get off the sideline a little more. 
Enjoyment: 9
Enjoyment here mostly comes from humor and how excited I am to see the characters progress as the series goes on. They do a good job at both. Kushieda, in particular, is great at catching attention in both aspects. If she is happy, she is super entertaining. If something is off with her, then something important is about to happen. Kitamura is also very bubbly and exciting. Taiga does ridiculous things all the time that are fun to watch. Ryuuji and Kawashima don't do much crazy stuff, but their conversations with other members of the cast are always earnest and endearing. I mention the characters so much because that is really where all the enjoyment is derived from. The series is nuanced and delicate, so this isn't a roller coaster ride... most of the time. Some scenes are very intense. But most of the time it is understated drama that is built and released over time. 
Overall: 9 
Nothing to say here. I don't think many people will try to crown Toradora! as the great crown jewel of anime, but it's a really solid show. They execute everything well and the entire work is cohesive and serves its message. 
Spoilers ahead. One thing I take issue with is the general theme of the series. It is supposed to be pretty optimistic, that anybody can find love in the most unexpected place. But I find it very bittersweet as well. Are people that bad at guessing where their truest feelings will lie? Is all it takes to build a strong relationship with somebody a certain level of familiarity? Those ideas are sort of sad and run against the ideas of traditional romance. This isn't something that Toradora! really hits on directly, so it doesn't impact your view very much. But it is somewhat haunting if you aren't satisfied with how the romantic interests panned out.",9
"
                I really enjoyed watching this Anime.
You might get disappointed if you don't watch the full episodes, including the after-credit-scenes. They resolve a lot!
I will watch it again.
The story is great, it deviates from most stereotypes. I can't compare it to anything known to me. 9/10 because the understanding relies too heavily on the persistence of the viewer to wait for the after-credit scene.
The art is fitting. They did a good job. It looks very natural, especially the fights.
The sound is great. The music underlines the mood and doesn't stand too much. I didn't get sick of any of the tracks.
The characters are unique and natural. Their behavior is relatable and sometimes adorable.
I cried. Twice! 9/10 because the first few episodes couldn't convince me to watch it in one go.
Overall 10/10. Watch it!",10
"
                Toradora! was the first romance, slice of life anime that I had ever watched. I was always more fond of stories like in Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, etc. I was expecting a very boring and predictable story like in a soap opera or something like that, but Toradora! really managed to surprise me! It was very fun to watch, there were never any boring or dull moments, since the anime is always moving forward in funny and clever ways.
-STORY: The story was lovely, not revolving just around the main characters and their lives, but also around their families and back stories, which makes it quite interesting.
                  It has always fun moments when we least expect it, but it can also get very emotional out of nowhere. I don't mean this as a bad thing, more of an unexpected thing that improves the story line, since we are looking forward for those touching moments and there aren't too many of them, otherwise it would loose some of its worth and make it boring to watch.
-ART: The art was so damn cute! One of the things I liked the most was the way the girls' hair flew, it always looked very light and beautiful. Also, everyone has really nice looking eyes. The backgrounds weren't that special, though. The second opening was really great in my opinion.
-SOUND: The soundtrack to Toradora! was magical, it had some happy sounding songs but also some very touching ones. It really fitted the anime in an unique way that I shall never forget. It could be the soundtrack for my life and I wouldn't matter.
-CHARACTER: The characters were great, the combination between Taiga, Ryuuji, Minori, Ami and Yuusaku worked perfectly! Nothing in their relationship seemed forced, the friendship flows between them easily and they're fun to follow. I liked the back stories each character had, and I'm not talking about the main ones alone, I'm talking about practically every single character.
I really did enjoy this anime, it became one of my favourite ones! I would definitely re watch it whenever I get the chance since it always makes me feel happy. Its such an easygoing series!
It's really worth it, I guarantee it!!
You'll enjoy it, I promise! ^_^",9

                This review will be spoiler free.
When I watch anime, how into it I am and the lasting effect it has on me (Post Series Depression) is how I measure how good a series is, and Toradora! has left me thinking about it for a very long time. The story is amazing, and there's no filler or anything like that in the show. The art and sound is really good, but that only compliments the amazing story of Toradora. I think what really makes Toradora memorable though are the realistic characters, who aren't completely perfect which makes them seem so much more realistic and relatable to.
                  There are unlikable and likable characters that don't remain so, which shows that the character development in this show is very good. Even characters who's personalities I had hated added much to the show by their interactions and chemistry with other characters. Overall Toradora! is an amazing show, and it's my favourite romcom anime although I haven't seen many of that genre.",10

                ""There is something in this world that no one has ever seen before. Its gentle and sweet. Maybe, if it could be seen, everyone would fight over it. The world hid it so no one can get their hands on it easily. However, someday, someone will find it. The person who deserves it the most will definitely find it. Because that's how it works"" 
Why I chose to watch this show : 
I'm a romantic guy, and I actually enjoy a well developed romance, but this was the first time I watched a romantic focused anime. I always got pissed by the way ""couples"" on
                  shounen shows just stop at the ""crush point"" forever hahaha even if both characters actually have mutual feelings. So I felt this need to actually watch something that could satisfy my romantic side, and Toradora! not only did that, but also made me want to watch more of that style of anime.
I started this review with that quote (which shows up at the very beginning of the first episode) because it summarizes one of the main lessons that Toradora wants to deliver : In a love story, not everyone will find love. Just a glimpse is enough to make a lot of people seek for it, but only the ones who deserve and complete each other the most will actually experience it. You might get hurt or screw up, but that's how it works. If you didn't get lucky, you need to assimilate the positive part of the experience, grow as a person and move on, or maybe even try again.
Story/Characters - 9/10
If you look at the story in general, its a big cliche, but the way characters act inside that main plot is what makes this show unique. The unusual characters and the common plot fit together, just like a love couple. Both are 9/10 for me, looking at their combination. Other thing I loved about the story is the way their love issues helped them overcome problems in other aspects of life, such as family, career, friedship etc. ( and by the way, secondary characters get some nice development at those moments. Ex: The student council president and Ryuuji's mother)
The 5 MC's are simply great, all of them have their qualities, weaknesses and  odd habits, and they manage to surprise you with each one of those. They end up becoming this weird, but at the same time great love mess ! And the best part: Even if the thing you were hoping for fails to develop, the real outcome is still satisfactory. I mean, every decision and path that each one of them take is carefully explained and backed up. They make sense, nothing happens out of nowhere, even if its kind of sudden, making it easier to understand, accept, and even enjoy this new path that the plot took. The secondary characters also shine in some parts of the series, making it even more unpredictable. At any moment, someone who's been hiding can rise up and take the main story into another direction.
Enjoyment - 7/10
So, a great story/characters wombocombo, but only 7/10 enjoyment ? Yeah, unfortunately, I thought that the slow pacing of the show got me kind of bored, more specifically midway through the series, where all characters and their situations were presented to the viewer, but no major breakthrough happened and they seemed kind of stuck. Its a normal scenario in this kind of dramas, of course, but imo they extended that for too long, making it hard to fully enjoy and kind of difficult to watch a lot of back to back eps.
Art/Soud - 7/10
Not a specialist in this area, but both fit Toradora well, speacially the soundtrack, that was really well-timed and dramatic. I wouldn't say they're like a love couple, but more like casual friends ( you like them, but they don't stand out enough to be loved hahaha )
Overall - 8/10
I would reccomend Toradora to everyone, specially ""main"" shounen watchers like me who need their romantic needs to be satisfied ! If you're an experienced romance/drama watcher, some flaws in this anime will probably bother you more than me, but it is still a very good show ! If you get bored by that slow paced section I mentioned, just stick to that good feeling you had while in the first espisodes, watch one or two of them at a time, and when finally things get going again, you won't be able to stop.
Thanks for reading, sorry for any english mistakes and feel free to tell me if I screwed up really bad at some point !",8

                I'm not the biggest fan of romantic comedy anime. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy them on occasion, but I never go OUT OF MY WAY to watch them when they come out, if you know what I mean. That being said, Toradora! is easily the best romcom anime ever made. At least in my opinion. Obviously it's subjective, but I freaking love this show, and I heartily recommend it to anyone who has yet to give it a watch.
For starters, it's one of the funniest shows I've ever seen, anime or otherwise. Sure, some of the humor leans a little towards the ecchi side,
                  but most of the actual jokes in the show stem from the character's personalities and how they clash with eachother, so it feels organic. Plus, the characters ARE all teenagers, so whenever the show DOES make a joke that leans more towards the raunchy dirty side, it feels believable, because c'mon, they're in high school. Hormones be running wild, y'know? 
Secondly, the characters in this show are sooo relatable, and the main romance feels genuine due to the gradual progression. The heartfelt scenes between all of the characters and the way their friendships and feelings develop and evolve over time helps add to this feeling, and it also makes each of our main cast incredibly relatable because, essentially, you're growing along with them. I might be biased bc I watched this series around the time I was finishing up high school, but I found the story to be really relatable and I loved almost every character in the show. 
Lastly, I feel like touching on the English dub-namely, it's quality. It's a lot better than fans of the show say it is. Now, I might be a little biased bc I didnt watch Toradora! until AFTER it had been dubbed so naturally, the dub was what I watched first, but I thought the VAs in the English version really gave it their all, and there isn't a single character who I would call ""miscast"". I've seen TONS of people hating on the dub online, and I'm honestly kinda baffled. Again, I'm probably biased bc I watched it dubbed first, or maybe they're biased bc they watched it in Japanese originally. That last one's definitely possible, I mean it originally aired in like what, 2008, and the dub didnt materialize until around 2014, so that's entirely plausible. Idk. Anyway, don't write off the dub is what I'm saying. If you prefer subs that's fine, I understand, but the dub is not awful like most other fans claim. Trust me, as someone who prefers dubs over subs, I have heard dubs that are a thousand times worse than this is made out to be. (Sword Art Online or Attack on Titan, anyone?)",10

                I love, love, love this show. I’m usually a big fan of romance anime, but this one’s on another level. There’s so much depth and solid character development, and the 25 episode arc is just perfect.
When I first got into anime a few months ago, I was chasing the high of Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5. This is the first show to satisfy the craving, as well as the love I felt towards those wonderful games.
This is the rare anime that I’ll know I’ll go back to and rewatch. Toradora! is easily one of my favorite anime shows of all time.

                Okay. My response after watching this whole anime without stopping. Would be just one simple word. ""Hooked"" I need more. The characters. The plot. The story. The soundtracks. This anime is by far my favorite one that I have ever seen. I need another season although I was very satisfied with the ending. I just feel like there is still a huge gap that could be filled with a second season. I understand that this probably won't happen. I just am in love with this anime and after watching it once. I felt like watching it again. Its just that good.

                *SPOILERS*
Basically this is gonna be a rant about the leading male character.  You have been warned. 
He almost has no emotions. His motives aren't explained at all. For example, why does he take care of her at the start? They weren't really friends before that. The became friends afterwards. Because her apartment is too messy and she doesn't eat healthy food? So what? I bet a lot of people live like that. Is he gonna help out every random person he meets?
Why does he put up with her awful personality? Again they weren't friends. We never see him showing any signs of falling
                  for her or anything so that crap about loving her for who she really is, is bull. If he had a crush on her or something so he did all that but she wasn't aware of that *friendzone* that'd be far better than what we got.
He doesn't know what he wants. He switches from one girl to another real quick. And of course the 3 main female characters in the show fall for him. OK, Taiga falling for him is understandable. Minori suddenly can't stand his charms? Ah, well, we'll let it slide. But why did they have to make the model fall for him too? It's like they know he's the main character so they have to fall for him. It would've been excused if he was particularly handsome or charming but he isn't. So why do they all fall for him?",7
"
                Laugh, joy, tears, disappointment, shunned, surprised, embarrassed, and a lot of emotion inside my heart built up while watching this anime...
I never felt this kind of emotion while watching the similar romance anime, the way of characters thinking, and progress of the story itself
Well, I have to admit it that I almost dropped watching this anime on the first episode, the reason because the design/artwork of the main story is a bit pathetic well just go to my review then.....
Story: 9/10 
The story progress is unpredictable, since the characters are unique, so the progress of the story is interesting, When I was watching this anime,
                  I was wondering what is happening next, since the progress of the story is not according to my imagination or my prediction, but the story come up with something more interesting.........
Art 7/10 
I don't like the artwork, I don't know why, lack of colour, perhaps, I don't know
I wonder if this anime will be more hit the best 10 in MAL if this project given to JC Staff.
I'm comparing this to Amnesia  so don't ask why I only give 7,
Sound: 9/10 
The music work perfectly, I like the first OP and the second and when chrismast.... Really Really like it........
Character: 10/10 
The characters are very unique, I like the anime because the character's action explained... Sometimes while enjoying another anime especially Slice of live, romance anime.. I'm dissapointed about why that person have bad personality or why that person do that...... In Toradora , it's explained well along the story... Even the ranked 3 Clannad series don't have this part......
And It's very amazing.......
Enjoyment: 10/10 
The reason why I give 10 is because the character and the story progress...
It will always remained in my memory, how I laugh when they do something comical, even when they happy, I feel relieved, happy for them even they just fiction, I don't know why, strange emotions huh..
Overall  10/10
Well I give it ten because as you can read above about the character and enjoyment itself, screw with the art that make me disappointed, One does not simply right",10
"
                This anime teaches us watches what it means when we want to understand others and the reason why to. For example, you can just disapprove someone because of your opinion, but did you try to figure out why the other person thinks another way? Either if yes or no, you should see things from the other person's perspective. Just like Toradora, at first the characters don't know each other's background and then when a character does find out something, they will seek to understand how the person feels. This anime has amazing character development where they start weak of being cowardly, but later on they
                  learn to move on and face their problems.
There was a lot of ""running away"" from problems in this anime, but the characters soon face it. So then it shows each character moving on and getting stronger.
The only problem was that the ending felt kind of rushed. For example, due to some actions there were a change of feelings very quickly. This may sound like a good thing, but the feeling I'm talking about is love. In the end of the anime I question myself of when the character had fallen in love with someone else. Anyway to make it more clear to me it was like ""I don't have those kind of feelings for that person anymore, and that is why I have feelings for this person"". So yeah, in the end the romance felt rushed of ""123""  (to represent someone's name to make it less confusing) liking ""abc"" and then ""def"" just because ""abc"" did something to ""123"".
Anyway the only problem was the rushed romance close to the ending of the anime. But besides that, the anime teaches us to try to understand others before disapproving them, and it also teaches that running away does not solve anything so you must face your problems. Well, not all of the characters faced their problem in the end, but at least most of them. This anime is recommended to those who enjoy romance, character development, a strong lead, comedy, and more.",9
"
                Toradora is a romance-comedy series with a normal-sized cast of characters that start off fighting with each other and then grow to become very close.
Overall the characters are relatable and at it's core, Toradora! feels more like a comedy due to its colourful and explosive cast.  I really loved this show. I mean it. The characters are so easy to cling to. This is just not some random romantic show where the boy or the girl is just too shy and needs the other one to notice him or whatever. This is an original, funny, heart touching and inspirational story which I urge you
                  to see. You will just be asking for more! 
Toradora! is directed by Tatsuyuki Nagai who is notable for other series such as Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day and The Anthem of the Heart which I think are really well directed as I do with this series, I do not have any complaints or anything notable to say about the direction except for, Bravo Tatsuyuki, Bravo.
The animation is done by J.C. Staff who are behind golden anime such as Love Stage!! and The Pet Girl of Sakurasou (Which I may or may not LOVE!!). The animation is very normal at times but during some action scenes throughout the series and a lot of the emotional parts it is very captivating and super well done. 
The music is incredible as well, providing amazing emotional teamwork with the animation and it can just make you cry by listening. The first OP is very catchy and suits Toradora and I was dissapointed when they switched over to the second Op because I no longer had that catchy tune to listen to at the beginning of each episode. The second Op isn't bad by any means, but it isn't as good as the first and the same could be said with the ed's.
Overall, if you want a funny, romantic, unique story, with a very likeable cast of characters (which, by the way, are voiced very well in the sub AND the dub) Then Toradora is the series for you. Quite honestly, I enjoyed the Dub more than the Sub for once. The emotion is displayed a lot better in my opinion. It is one of a kind and will make you laugh and will make you cry. Exactly what I was hoping for in a romance-based anime. The plot is simple yet effective. nothing complicated but nothing boring
Stream it, buy it, I don't care.. just watch it. You will not be 
dissapointed.",9
"
                I love Toradora! Whatever that means... still not sure where the title comes from... I just assume its used in the same way ""amazing!"" or ""yahoo!"" are used. Anyways now for the review
Toradora! Does practically everything right for a rom-com high school drama. Every single episode is exciting, or dramatic, or both done equally well. The plot of the anime is hardly new or complex, but its done better than mostly all others. Taiga's transition throughout the story from hating to loving Takasu is done well, however it felt like the same cant be said for Takasu. It was obvious he cared very much for
                  Taiga, but it was hard to believe he was head-over-heels in love with her in the same way Taiga was for him. The three side characters were so awesome and at times felt like they could bet the star of the show. All three are given backstories, character development, and their own story lines in episodes. The two MC's love story is hardly deep or symbolic, but the story the rest of the characters go through is so well done and full of symbolic themes. Minori and Ami are practically counter-parts of each other and display the themes of self-acceptance and finding what makes you happy. The way Minori and Ami shine in the second half of the show helps push this show into an iconic stature.
The biggest mistake of this show comes after episode 23, after the truth of Taiga's feelings are revealed to everyone. Immediately after confessing their mutual feelings of love, they approach the idea of running away and getting married. What?!?!? Not only was this idea so generic in western society entertainment but it didn't make sense at all for what was going on. Thankfully they dont fully go with this ending and figure out a bit more satisfying ending for all the characters... but the ending still to me is the only thing holding this back from being a 10/10
The school festival and Christmas arc are especially memorable, and the beach house episode is nothing but FUN! The OST piece "" Lost my Pieces "" is one of my favorite songs to come out of watching anime and is placed so well throughout the story. To me this anime does comedy better than something like Your Lie in April and exceeded my expectations on the drama side. Episodes 13 and 17are the most memorable. This show truly had three best girls",9
"
                This anime could shock and astound you but the thing is it maybe funny. The scene that made me cry (in my opinion) is how the characters fight and how they sacrifice their own joy for someone else's joy. There are many quotes that you can get from the anime. The story is great and the art is somewhat good. The sound is quite nice. The characters may have their own specialties but there is a character there that I somewhat can't find him attractive (Takasu). Animes like this are very interesting. You will expect the unexpected. So i am inviting you to watch this
                  anime for it is very different from the other animes that I've watched.",7
"
                Where should i start with this, i haven't seen an anime in a very long time that I've enjoyed as much this one, everything came together perfectly, so i'll break it down for you without spoiling anything.
Story : Well the strongest point in Toradora! is it's story, it may have a typical slic of life love triangle storyline when you just look at it's face value, but there is much more to it than that, especially during the climax of the series, while the development is slow it's well worth the wait, from beginning to end honestly just perfection in my opinion. 
Art : As
                  good as it gets when you are messing with slice of life anime.
Sound : I'm a sound engineer by occupation....So in this case they fell short to me but still pretty amazing for the everyday anime lover.
Character : The characters are outstanding, they pull you in with all their unique personalities. If you aren't in love with Tiaga and Ryuuji by the end then i'm not sure what to tell ya, the development in their characters are normal for slice of life.....BUT because of the dynamics they have together you really don't feel it.
Overall : TRULY MY FAVORITE SLICE OF LIFE ANIME OF ALL TIME",10
"
                Toradora! is one of those anime where you should refrain from casting judgement until you’ve seen it through until the end. As a case in point, even midway through, I wasn’t sure what all the hubbub about the show was about. Now, however I fully understand why the show has captured the hearts of so many.
As I touched upon before, Toradora! is a very well-received anime. From what I’ve seen, it’s regarded as one of the best romance anime. It is the favorite anime of many. This in and of itself could serve as a draw to the series. If you want to be in
                  the conversation in regards to anime, after watching Toradora!, you’ll be sure to find someone to discuss it with.
Toradora! Follows Ryuuji Takasu -- a first-year high schooler who’s ostracized due to his frightening appearance -- and Taiga Aisaka -- a girl whose extremely short stature belies fiery and violent attitude. Their paths cross when Ryuuji inadvertently discovers a love letter from Taiga, causing her to blackmail him into helping her win the affections of her crush. 
That’s a very simple synopsis, but I don’t really want to give away too much. 
Toradora! has a very colorful cast of characters, and I’m pleased to say they’re a joy to watch. In particular, I love Ryuuji and Kitamura just due to how nice they are. For Toradora! I watched the Japanese audio version, and all the seiyuu sound fantastic, lending a lot of emotion and character to their roles. I don’t exaggerate when I say that every main character has hidden depths that allow you to appreciate them more. All of their actions make sense and they have reasons for some of their more bizarre and egregious traits. Most importantly, they grow as people.
You should keep this in mind, because the show certainly might not seem like its anything more than surface level at first.
Most of my marks against Toradora! are at the beginning, specifically the first four episodes or so. Toradora! is an amazing ride, but it takes a bit to leave the station, so to speak. The main problem for me lies in the fact that Taiga, at least initially, is a very hard character to love. Bear in mind that I generally loathe characters of the tsundere archetype and Taiga may as well be the queen. Violent, spiteful, load, and possessing a hair-trigger temper, Taiga is the epitome of the trope. And while she’s multi-faceted, she gets better, and she has a reason for the way she acts, it doesn’t watching her any easier. She proved particular aggravating to me because I had to watch her abuse the mild-mannered Ryuuji and see him warm up to her despite her doing nothing to deserve his kindness.
Even ignoring Taiga, I just didn’t find the first few episodes special. The jokes aren’t that funny and it just seems like your standard romcom. If I hadn’t watched the first eight episodes in one go, I might have dropped the series. I would have been missing out on a terrific series, but in my defense, I wouldn’t have known better. It’s a show’s job to hook watchers in early on, and Toradora! unfortunately doesn’t do that well, in my opinion.
Toradora! does reward the faithful for staying however, and it’s all uphill from there. I know one of the most ridiculous things to say when recommending a show to someone is “oh, just keep watching, it gets better! I swear.” For one, it forces new viewers to place their faith in a show despite evidence that its sub-par. With me acknowledging how crazy I sound, please, please believe me when I say the show gets better. It gets amazing. Come the second third of the show, all the jokes land, the animation becomes more fluid as J.C. Staff hits its stride, and serious elements are abound. 
The final third of the series, signified by a change in OP and ED, is easily the best portion of the show. It’s definitely more dramatic than the rest of the series, but the shift isn’t jarring. The series gradually moves from comedic to more serious and romantic elements, and I was impressed by how natural it felt. Given the characters I saw at the beginning, I was surprised by how real everyone felt and how naturally the romance progressed.
The music is memorable and fits each scene well.
Hindsight is 20/20, so getting through the beginning will doubtlessly be easier upon a rewatch. As a bonus incentive to watch it again, Toradora! features a lot of foreshadowing.
Overall, Toradora! Is a show that I find a bit hard to recommend. It takes quite a while to hit its stride, but once it does, its all smooth sailing until a great finish. This unassuming romcom is like an onion - it has layers, and it just might make you cry. The art is great, the zany characters will make you laugh, and the connections that the characters forge will warm your heart. I’m really grateful that I got to watch such a heartwarming anime during the holiday season. At first I wasn’t sure what the fuss was about -- it just seemed like your typical anime. Toradora! still isn’t perfect, but there’s something about it that made me smile. And that’s good enough in my book.
Now if you excuse me, in Preparation for curing my Silky Heart, I must eat an Orange sprinkled with Vanilla Salt.
(Yes, I know the name’s Pre-Perade, but I don’t know how to fit that into a sentence, sue me.)

"
                Despite the popular consensus , Toradora! is not a romance anime. Allow me to explain.
In a standard romance anime, the two romantic leads are generally supported by a secondary cast whose sole purpose is to act as cheerleaders for the leads and push them together. That isn't the case here, as all of the supporting cast have their own motives and reasons to exist within the story.
Ryuji and Taiga, as the romantic leads, aren't really romantic leads in the usual sense. The story isn't demanding they pair up as in most romantic series; they, too, have motivations outside of being a couple.  As a
                  consequence, the entire cast is a group of likable characters, even though one or two take some time becoming likable.
The animation is quite well done, even though the quality drops at certain points. This only happens rarely, but it's hard to miss.
The sound is really good, with a good opening song for the first half of the series. At certain points, when ""Lost my Pieces"" plays (and you'll know when you hear it), expect feels.
The english dub (I haven't personally heard the sub), is one of the finest in all of anime (Cassandra Morris is wonderful as Taiga), and as such deserves to heard by as many people as possible.
All in all, Toradora! is very enjoyable, with a lot of humour throughout and a good
cast of characters.",10
"
                This review contains major spoilers, because there is no other way to discuss why I hate this anime.
Ryu is a high school junior whose purpose in life seems to be living to please others. He feels ostracized because he inherited his absent fathers' intimidating appearance, when in reality, he is a gentle soul who enjoys the pursuits of a stereotypical housewife--his mouth literally waters at opportunities to clean mold and shop with coupons. So when he falls in love with Taiga, a troubled girl with severe daddy issues and an abandonment complex, it's clearly a match made in heaven, right?
Both Ryu and Taiga initially pursue
                  other romantic interests before eventually realizing that suddenly, they don't love those other people at all anymore; the two of them now love each other--for literally no other reason than the fact they're always together. They don't get along particularly well; they are not physically attracted to one another; and early on, they don't particularly appreciate each other--Ryu serves Taiga's every whim with no real explanation as to why, which Taiga rewards exclusively by heaping verbal abuse on him.
Ryu gives Taiga food and a stable place to sleep, nothing more; she gives him nothing at all in return. Nothing about their personalities makes them suited to be together, or makes you say ""yes, they seem like a good couple""; not even in the sense of making up for each others' shortcomings. Of all the anime I've seen that try to frame the central romance as a form of co-dependency, this one seemed, to me, the most unhealthy. That would have been poignant if handled correctly, but the story and characters accept and even champion their toxic co-dependency.
Their initial inability to understand their own feelings (both towards each other, and towards their temporary romantic interests), followed by their sudden decision to elope before coming of age, lead to Ryu and Taiga being a massive burden on everyone around them. But of course, because this is an anime, everyone is--completely inexplicably--more than happy to enable the pair. This issue extends beyond the two of them; the entire cast has so many moments of such utter selfishness that I struggled to take the characters seriously.
I will admit that this anime had moments that I found sweet, or that managed to touch me. Despite that, the overarching themes of the story and characters arcs felt repulsive to me, and at times even directly at odds with the moments I found the most meaningful. Overall, I found the show incredibly distasteful. Toradora! seems to advocate that you should settle for whoever happens to be closest to you--*especially* if you are insecure about your own worth. For all the hype surrounding this anime, it rarely goes deeper than that.",3
"
                This anime is the typical but good school/slice of life/romance anime.Although the story itself was not something exceptional,it did not fail to keep me entertained until the very last episode.The artwork was very cute and well-done and made the whole experience even better.In my personal opinion,it is a great anime as far as this genre is concerned;it had romance,a decent amount of comedy and it is very relatable to the teenage feelings and experiences almost everyone gets through in highschool. The main character, Taiga is adorable and also the queen of tsundere in  my opinion xD 
To sum up, I recommend this anime to
                  all the people who enjoy slice of life comedy and romance anime, such as nisekoi :) have fun",8

Overall: 6
(Past here there will be minor spoilers, although mostly just gripes with numerical review styling)
Story: Not a bland story to say, but it feels like it holds out on plot points for extended periods of time, and goes by very slowly. Melodrama gets quite annoying too.
Art: Its alright and has a distinct style.
Sound: No Qualms, soundtrack is not bad, but not amazing either.
Character: Amazingly well done, Taiga has a distinct love path and has a definite visible character change throughout the show, not to mention Ryuugi and his defined character's moral changes and thoughts through the show. Probably the best aspect of this series.
Overall the show is good watch, but has a long Big Bang Theory type feeling where it just drains you of energy watching through the minor plot points lead into a big reveal, although that may just be my impatience, but there is lots of dumb drama that gets old fast.
Don't be afraid to say this review is helpful. (It helps my Ego because I like internet points)",6
"
                This anime was probably the best I've ever seen, that may be due to me binging 25 episodes straight and it making my heart really fuzzy.
The story is really original but the setting is quite cliched, but it didn't bother me at all.
I can honestly say that I loved the pacing. It went fast when I wanted it to.
But I do dislike something about the story, and that is that it ended too soon. The 25th episode didn't have enough romance between Asaika and Takasu, so I feel like there really should have been a 26th episode.
The characters are super memorable, and likeable.
Asaika was cute
                  and honest.
Takasu was thoughtful.
The others were likeable (not inferior to the main duo btw)
For the art, I don't really have a baseline, so I don't really know how this compares much. I think that it is outstanding, the facial expressions say much and the movements are fluid.
Also, no face deformations.
The sound, it was great. The voice acting was really realistic and the background music was really really fitting.
I loved the first OP and ED.
For enjoyment, it was awesome. I don't think I ever had so much fun without being conflicted about something wrong with the anime/manga ever. Toradora! was the most relaxed and carefree I will probably be with the medium. 
In conclusion, a funny romcom that is at times really serious without making the mood strange. The story is so well interwined that it flows really well. The only bother (I'm ok with it now) I experienced was that in the first few episodes Asaika acts violently towards Takasu. (But as stated in ok with it now)
Bonus: really sweet, and I don't feel disgusted like when I finish a Shoujo manga.
The emotions are really realistic, in the sense that I could see real people act like the characters. That makes the sweet parts even more sweet and the painful parts even more heart wrenching.
A definite recommend for any. 
Although a warning, I started this at 23h, and here I am at 9:34, the following day, writing a review a couple minutes after finishing it, having binged through the 25 episodes happily. 
Thus, one should definitely try to separate their viewing sessions and not do anything that may make themselves regret, because one will associate those feelings of guiltiness by procrastination with Toradora!, which would create bittersweet feelings when recalling it. 
One should write down their thoughts, and go clear-headed into each episode.
Doing so, one would understand the anime even more, and possibly have better memories of it. (I didn't do so, but take my word (well I did write the review for this reason))
Bonus': COME ON MORE ROMANCE BETWEEN THEM (the anime finished years ago)
Bonus'': I'm serious about the part of not doing anything that may make you regret by watching Toradora!. Finish all your work, finish your responsibilities, earn your time watching this show. I seriously recommend this to all.",10

                This anime was indeed annoying at times, and it sorta sucks that things dont happen until towards the end of the series, but, its really deep, and its also VERY romantic, decent art, and the story line is pretty decent, the characters have wonderful personalities, the series stays on task and topic most of the time, great series, Its also sorta casual, it doesnt go fictional or anything

                For thouse of you reading these reviews thinking,  ""I don't get what the big deal is,  just reading the storyline/synopsis I can predict the outcome!""
       It is true that the storyline is not appealing, however, the characters are incredible.
The art is adorable,  the music is poppin,  but the thing that this anime REALLY has to offer is the characters.  Each character REALLY developes.  Watching episode one,  the ending is not predictable at all.  Each character has such wonderfull chemistry with the others,  and more so, chemistry with the viewers. 
                  
Words can not say why this anime is amazing.  If you've read these reviews, and still haven't watched it, then SHAME ON YOU.  This is incredible.",10

                This is an everyday high school life kind of anime.The two main characters Taiga and Ryuuji.Both of them help each other to win the hearts of the person they admire..The girl ryuuji admires is minori who is the best friend of taiga and the guy Taiga likes is Ryuji's best friend.I've only watched 11 episodes so i cant explain much but basically its just a typical high school life with some problems here and there
Art: Its art is pretty unique.I find Taiga unique as i dun see characters drawn like her very often.Same goes for ryuuji..The thing i like about this art is that its
                  not some typical common looking anime character :D
Sound: sound is reasonable i guess no flaws and such
Character: Ryuuji is actually and good and non violent guy dispite his looks and the misunderstandings ppl gives him because of his appearance. Taiga on the other hand is cute and small sized but dispite her appearance shes very violent and alot of ppl are afraid of her..including teachers..there are a few other characters which will be introduced and im sure you'll come to find them interesting as i do too
Enjoyment: so far i think i enjoyed it well . Good comedic scenes which will be sure to tickle ur funny bone(omg that line was so corny haha)
Overall i guess this anime is worth a 9 :3
hope my review helps ya! enjoy watching Toradora :3",9
"
                ""The greatest love story ever told."" is the sentence that I always see being used to describe Toradora, is it truly?
To find out, I recently decided to rewatch this show that I've already finished a decent amount of time ago, and even though I already immensely enjoyed it the first time I watched it, surprisingly enough I loved it even more as a second time viewer. I genuinely and desperately didn't want it to end, yet I couldn't stop watching every single episode back to back. Maybe that comment wasn't for nothing after all.
Toradora follows Ryuuji, who is a gentle guy but has an intimidating
                  face that makes people afraid of him, labeling him as a delinquent. Taiga is the Palm-top Tiger of the school, a little but vicious girl who IS actually the violent character here. These two are in love with each other's bestfriends, so they decide to help each other out to win the affections of the ones they love, hilarity ensues.
 Now if you have ever seen a love story, you know damn well that Ryuuji and Taiga will end up with each other instead, and the show doesn't act as if it's a grand reveal either, so it's the way the show builds up this premise that makes it so damn enjoyable. The anime does a great job to come up with scenarios where drama could take place too and execute it beautifully.
The artstyle while not the most unique still looks great. I'm especially fond of Ryuuji and Taiga's character deisgns. they're simple yet very iconic. The rest of the cast kinda pale in comparison to our two leads in terms of design, but they still have interesting if not likeable outer appearances.
 The show has beautiful backdrops that sell it's strong atmosphere. The cinematography is great, there is a nice sense of reality to the world. When Ryuuji is at the christmas party and Taiga is holed up in her home, the show does a great job to make you feel the long distance between them. It builds up it's atmosphere and convey the feelings of it's characters through it's visuals just like how a good picture should and it's absolutely great.
I didn't particularly care for the opening or ending themes (the first op was much better than the second though) but the show has a great soundtrack that accompany it's emotional moments. Especially the track ""Lost my pieces"" destroys my heart everytime I hear it, even after finishing the show. And it's obvious they were aware how good a song it was too, as it's used to great effect during emotional moments.
The characters are all well written even when they're not particularly likeable people. For example, I can say that I hated Ami with every fiber of my being, but I can't call her a poorly written character because she simply isn't. In fact compared to more blandly written characters like Kitamura, she has a lot more going on.
Of course the strongest characters of Toradora is Ryuuji and Taiga. Their journey as they learn about each other and also themselves is the main source of light that makes this show shine. 
Toradora is a show that made me experience a wide range of emotions during it's run. And even though it has it's problems that I'm willing to acknowledge (like the ending that was kind of rushed and not completely satisfying), I simply can't label this show as anything other than a must see, expecially if you're into romance and/or drama as a genre.
It's not a perfect anime, but there is no perfect anime, and because there is no such thing as a perfect anime that I can give Toradora the 10/10 rating it deserves. There's simply no other romance anime that compares to this. 
Yuuji and Taiga's journey is just too compelling.",10

                 Review on Toradora!(^_−)☆ ((Spoilers))
-----------▹Summary◃
Ryūji Takasu is about to enter his second year of high school. Despite his gentle personality, his eyes make him look like an intimidating delinquent, so he feels utterly disturbed that he inherited his eyes from his father that make people scared of him. Later that day in the halls, he mets a girl that is known for being dangerous and rude, Taiga Aisaka, who happens to be in his class and best friends with his crush Minori. Finding out that Taiga has a crush on his best friend, he agrees to help her out and she agrees to help him
                  get together with Minori. Ryūji and Taiga start getting along more as things progress with the relationships between the characters and eventually confess their true feelings of love towards each other.
-----------▹My Opinion◃
Toradora is one of my favorite anime love stories, I felt that Toradora was very focused on family issues which in other anime like Clannad, those play apart in the plot but is not the main conflict. I heard that some people where bugged on the Christmas episode where Ryūji left to go confess to Minori and Taiga realized that she doesn't want him to go. Some people complained that she suddenly realized it but I don't think so because in the episode where Ryūji fell into the water also drowning, Taiga went to save him and after she was upset for no one realizing it and yelled ""Ryūji is all mine! No one else can touch him!"" That should have been a hint to the viewers that Taiga cares for him and that leads to her realizing her own feelings
-----------▹Characters◃
Taiga is fabulous she's a typical tsundere and he's super adorable.
Minori is so energetic and nice and she is that one person who can get along with anyone. Ami at first tbh I thought she was super annoying especially at the restaurant but I started to like her more even though she was cocky and bugged Taiga. Ryūji has a really gentle and kind personaliy despite his looks and I liked the character contrasts.

"
                This show is garbage. Here is why:
Story: 2/10
For most of the anime nothing really happens, just some dunb gags, you can seriously skip all the episodes except the first episode and the last one, the show would still make sense if you do so. 
Art: 4/10
Toradora characters have some of the worst character designs in the industry. 
They have nothing you could tell about their personality based on their looks. 
Maybe Taiga has good character design, since it's really recognizable, but other characters, no. 
Sound: 7/10
Characters from this anime are voiced by some of the most famous seiyuus in the industry, like Kugimiya Rie, Horie
                  Yui and Kitamura Eri. I loved their voice performance, despite the fact I didn't like the show itself. 
Character: 2/10
Some of the fakest anime characters ever. None of them are honest with their true feelings.
Taiga was annoying, Minori was fake and Ami was just, unnecesary. Male characters were a little better, 
but annoying as well. 
Enjoyment: 3/10
I needed two months to complete this anime, I usually need less than a month to complete an anime with the amount of episodes like this. In conclusion, this show was just boring. 
Overall: 3/10
I think this show deserves this score from me. 
I do not recommend it. It is a waste of time.",3
"
                First of all.. i don't like thisa anime. And second, it seems like i'm the only one who dislike ths anime idk why :/
I hardly even get through episode one sorry. And then i forced myself to watch episode two, but it got 2 times boring than episode one and main reason why i dropped it so quick was the girl lol
It was boring and the main girl character was super annoying and i just can't. I also didn't find any interesting conflict in this anime
The characters design also not my type or taste, which makes it even worse ig
So many people recommend me this
                  anime. Saying this is the best romcom that's why it's so sad because i thought this anime will be something interesting and fun to watch but.... yeah. well this is my opinion",2
"
                Story:  The story’s on the first view nothing special, it’s a normal high school life mixed with slice-of-life. The two main characters agree to a partnership of convenience and get thereby closer to each other. But what makes this story so great is the ‘perfect mix’ of the humorous and serious parts. There are very dramatically and sad scenes in contrast to happy and funny scenes. And this is combined to a very amazing mixture with both comedy and drama-romance.
Art/Animation: Regarding the fact that the anime is from 2008/09 the animations are great and accurate. The facial expressions of the characters are very fitting;
                  especially I like Ryuuji’s delinquent-look. Also the environment (school, the homes of the characters) looks very decent. All in all the animations are very nice, but not that spectacular (for the present-day expectations).
Sound: While I didn’t like the first opening that much, the other opening and the endings are absolutely great. They perfectly match the anime in my opinion and are really catchy so you will definitely keep them in your mind. Also the soundtracks (especially ‘Lost my pieces’) underscore the effect of the particular scenes. 
Characters: Beside the story the characters are the very best part. There are very complex characters; the delinquent Ryuuji and the mini-tsundere Taiga as protagonists. While Ryuuji seems like a normal teenager and the total contrary to other anime’s male characters, Taiga is really aggressive but she also has her warm and amiable sides. Next to the main characters there are also 3 minor characters; each of them has an own not less complex personality. (I want to point out Kawashima Ami, who has a personality of a type you’ve probably never seen before.)
Enjoyment: It’s beyond question; Toradora was one of the shows I enjoyed the most. After every episode I was so curious about the further development of the characters and their relation to each other. I could watch this series over and over again without getting bored of it. The comedy parts are funny when they’re supposed to, and the drama parts do their part at the right time as well. It’s just the right proportions which make this anime so enjoyable.
Overall: This anime is great and a must-watch for every anime fan, since it mixes some important genres together. Also the characters are so complex and carefully elaborated; there are very, very few anime which had such good characters. So all in all I just can recommend you watching this anime; you won’t regret it.",10
"
                Toradora was the first anime that EVER made me cry hard and not many others have made me cry the way Toradora did. Toradora, while it can be a bit ridiculous at times, feels very grounded to me and the first time I watched it, I was the same age as the characters and I could feel the way they did - it's why the anime resonated with me so much and why it still does. It was the first anime that made me go, huh, I can relate to that. 
STORY - 8
It's simple at first, Taiga and Ryuji make a deal to help
                  the other get closer to their crushes and hijinks ensue. Their friendship leads to rumours about their relationship and at first, it sounds like a fun rom-com and it really is. The story is pretty simple, but it's full of laughs. Watching them fail and succeed at setting the other up is funny and then watching Taiga and Ryuji fall in love made it heartwarming. Though, as the series goes on, we realise there's a lot more to them then meets the eye though. Taiga has deep rooted issues due to feeling isolated by her family and while I do not have these issues with family per say, that loneliness and isolation Taiga felt was what resonated with me. I understood how she felt, because that was how I felt. 
ART - 9
It's a cute art style. It's not a stand out art style but it's still cute. Not much more I can say about it honestly.
SOUND - 8
The OST was pretty nice and the first OP is the best. It's catchy, fun and up tempo and it'll get stuck it your head. The second OP is good too, as well as the EDs. I didn't honestly pay that much attention to the music, I was too invested in the characters. I've watched it both dubbed and subbed, and have no preference. Watch it how you prefer, I do tend to lead toward the dub only because I find dubs more relaxing.
CHARACTER - 10
The characters are what makes Toradora so good, in my opinion. Taiga is my favourite character and probably my favourite tsundere girl too (though Chitoge is a close second). I feel like she takes on the trope of tsundere and sticks to it well, but more importantly, she goes beyond just that trope and a good character needs to do that. Ryuji is just as likeable, though his obliviousness does get grating sometimes. The supporting characters are all fun and entertaining, Ami being the stand out of them. 
ENJOYMENT - 10
As I said, Toradora was the first anime that made me really cry because I felt like I related to Taiga's feelings of loneliness. It also made me laugh so so much and it's incredibly heart warming and fun as well. It's one of the few anime I could watch over and over and never get sick of, the characters are too fun and the simple story always manages to hook me in. The characters are relatable and fun and that makes it even more enjoyable.
OVERALL - 10
There's a reason Toradora is my favourite romance anime and the anime I'll suggest to anyone looking for something new. It's fun, it's relatable and the characters really hook you in. The characters elevate what is a rather simple story of two friends helping each other with their crushes and it was genuinely heartwarming to see the romance between Taiga and Ryuji blossom. Toradora is must see for anyone who enjoys romance anime, and although Taiga's tsundere trope could turn people away, her growth beyond that is what makes her such a compelling character.",10
"
                I thoroughly enjoyed this anime! It had outstanding art, story, sound, and characters. I look forward to a season 2 for this series. Great character development and plot. There are moments of melodrama and exaggerated emotion, but it achieves a perfect balance between weaving a cohesive and charming plot with traditional anime elements. It is one of the few anime in which I would watch again. The music was also outstanding. It reinforced many of the scenes - including the more emotional ones. There are abundant amounts of laughter and comedic scenes for everyone, as well as comic relief characters to offset the dramatic scenes.
                  Please WATCH! It is worth the journey of 25 episodes!",9
"
                The first time I learn the existence of Toradora, which is when I'm still relatively new to anime, I'm initially skeptical about the show's general quality and popularity. Googling the series promo art, the impression I get that its a stock rom-com with pretty recognizable archetypes. Ryuuji is the nice guy, Minori the genki girl, Taiga most obviously a tsundere and so on.
Of course, when it comes to story, execution is really what matters and I do enjoy my share of romcom. However I found most of them not exactly to be emotionally affecting, with their conflict are generally constructed  around ""getting these two
                  leads together"" with less-than-graceful execution. Reliance on misunderstanding, drama contrivance, just not-so-good writing all around.
Toradora, however, prove itself to be a different beast. The series isn't interested in just having the characters going through all sort of shenanigans and hijinks, and also baiting the relationship between its two leads for our amusement. Toradora care for its characters, and also wants them to develop and grow. And the series does it like it was the easiest thing ever.
If there is one thing Toradora is about, I'd say its about teenagers growing up, whether its moving toward maturity and/or moving past their crushes, and about good-intentioned people hiding and surpressing their feeling for one another, in order not to damage to status quo and hurt their friends, even if it will kill them.
Toradora begins with a pretty dense first episode that establish all the basic variables in the story which feels like it was longer than it is, which is to its credit. It begins with the introduction of our misunderstood teenager protagonist, Ryuuji Takasu, who was avoided by his peers due to his menacing look. After an unfortunate, or fortunate, run in with another school delinquent Taiga Aisaka, he discover that she has a crush toward his best friend, Yusaku Kitamura. Coincidentally, Ryuuji himself has feelings toward Taiga's best friend, Minori Kushieda. With those knowledge in mind, the two decided to team up to help one another get closer to their respective crushes. 
By the time the credits roll, I feel like I've already known so much about the characters. Their personality, their struggle and what their want in their life. And the entire pacing of the episode feels natural instead of frenetic (courtesy of the series composer, Mari Goddang Okada).
That was probably the moment in which Toradora grabbed my attention. The one that really makes me fell in love however, was the following episode in which Taiga finally confess her feeling to Kitamura which resulted in rejection, followed by Ryuji declaration that he'll be the dragon to Taiga's, well, tiger.
Not only the event from Taiga's confession to Ryuji's declaration feels like a climax in any other romcom, it also really solidified the rapport and the relationship  between the two.
From there, Toradora generally spends the entire first half of the series getting the characters into pretty much standard high school anime scenario, summer vacation at the beach, school festival, etc. But with even generally familiar scenario, the series keeps a good balance between comedy and the development of each characters psychology and relationships, in particular, Taiga and Ryuuji realization that the one they actually love are closer than they think, not the crushes they often hold in pedestal (recurring thread which Toradora likes to address).  All of this comes to a head in the more dramatic second half of the series, in which all of the characters began to realize that the world and the dynamic between them has changed, and their wish for comfortable stasis and something stable may will caused them to do bad things for one another, whether out of selflessness or selfishness. Watching the second half, you really wish for all of the characters to end up happy, but not without them hurting themselves first.
The characters are pretty much the stars in Toradora. While on broadstroke, all of them has pretty basic type, the series use those type as a jumping platform for deeper characterization and even subvertion. Ryuuji is well intentioned young man who cares deeply about his friends, but his inability to read mood often caused him trouble. Taiga is a unstable girl who often lashed out on others, but it was as the result of her unhappy family live. Her best friend Minori is a cheerful energetic girl who wear a fragile mask of her own. The real standout however, was Ami. Kitamura's multi faceted childhood friend who seems to really know what's going on with each characters but couldn't do anything to help other than cryptic message as an outsider looking in.
Honestly there's not much I could complain about Toradora, but I do have some complaint. For one, the beginning of Kitamura arc felt awkwardly structured, although the finale was pretty satisfying. I'm also less lenient toward the series humor, coming back. All the character-driven one are solid, but many also quote unquote anime humor, like the homeroom teacher who couldn't get married or the beginning of episode 6. And while the direction was nice, the general aesthetic, animation and music are pretty serviceable.
All in all, I like Toradora. Its heartwarming emotional-ride that quite well-deserved its reputation.",8
"
                I first heard about ToraDora on the Crunchyroll podcast and I decided I would give it a try. I normally don't watch this style of anime but after recent success with ReLife I decided it was now or never for giving this show a chance. Boy am I glad I took the time to watch this series. I can't begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this one. I will admit it took me a little while to get invested fully into the story but once I was hooked I was hooked! So without further delay here is my review of ToraDora! 
Story: 
The
                  story of ToraDora is a pretty standard love story. Two seemingly mean and angry high school kids love two of the popular kids and they work together to find a way to express their love to their crushes. After fighting to show their crushes how much they care for them the unexpected happens and .... well I won't spoil the rest. Even if the story line is somewhat predictable, it does not take away from the viewers enjoyment of this series. I could tell by episode two who was going to end up together in the end. But the story is written in such a way that you can still make a case for multiple plot twists and finishes. I found myself rooting for one couple and then a few episodes later hoping they would not end up together because I was rooting for one of them to date another character. This was due in large part to the way characters developed throughout the series. I can say the more I watch this show the more I learn about each individual character. You miss some of the small lines and clues the first time through. You can really get attached to some of the other characters after multiple viewing of this series.  In the end, I was very happy with the way the story ended and I felt myself being pulled by my heart strings as I watched the last two episodes of the series. There are not many anime shows that I can honestly say made me feel such a strong emotional attachment to the storyline and the characters. All I can say is this show left me wanting more and more. And after watching this all the way through around 6 times I still love it just as much now as I did the first time. And I still feel the emotion every single time I watch it. 
Art: 
The art in ToraDora was fantastic. I found it hard to believe that this show came out in 2008-2009 because it looks like it could have easily come out this year. I am no expert at picking out details or criticizing art so I was very impressed by how the show looked. They did a great job of using the right colors to fit the different moods of the show. This is a relatively happy and upbeat anime so there were tons of bright and vibrant colors. This was a rather serious and straightforward show and by that I mean there were no exaggerated faces or silly effects.  After watching this show multiple times I can add some more information to the art portion of the review. One of the small changes in the show is how the are changes with the characters. In the beginning characters like Taiga have an edge to them. You can see anger in her expressions and actions. By the end of the show, you can see a softness in the way she is drawn. It is really one of the cool but little things that changes as the show progresses. 
Sound: 
I watched the English version of ToraDora and can say I was very pleased with the sound and voice acting, All the character voices seemed to fit the character's personalities. The two characters that stand out to me were Ryuuji and Aisaka. Ryuuji had a very stern but caring voice which fit his character perfectly. Aisaka was also very well done in the voice category. I feel like her bubbly and goofy personality really came through in the voice acting and it really made the character something special. I can say the same about other characters but I will leave it at just those two for times sake. I will add that the intro and ending songs for the first half of the series could be my favorite anime songs ever! I completely fell in love with the two tracks and they instantly brought a smile to my face and reminded me of just how much I was enjoying the show I was watching. They made my Anime soundtrack list on my IPod I enjoyed them that much! I can also say after giving it some time I fell in love with the two tracks that replaced the intro and exit songs as well! The song choice for the second half of the show was great. The first half of the series was very light and fun as the characters were getting to know one another. As the series went on things got a little tougher and feelings became a focal point and the intro and exit song changing to a more serious tone only made sense. Its the little things that makea great show and this is just one of those little things! 
Character: 
I think what made this series stand out to me was the character development. They did a great job of giving us a slow burn on the character's personality changes. The characters would slowly open up as the series went on which allowed the viewer to slowly peel back the layers of their personality and really become emotionally attached to the characters. I really liked that the characters motivations were always changing and we could see it happening but they could not. It made the series very interesting to see them struggling to see the obvious when I knew what was happening the whole time. In many situations I found myself yelling at the TV, trying to get Ryuuji to make the obvious choice or for him to stop being so totally oblivious!! Long story short I loved the characters in this show I can honestly say I felt and emotional investment in what happened to each one of the main characters and I can say that is not a normal thing for me. I have to say you need to watch this series a couple of times. The more I watch the series the more different characters stand out. Since the initial story is kind of obvious your whole motivation the first time through is seeing how we get from point A to point B. But if you watch the series over you will notice the small things you might have missed the first time through! You will see that characters like Ami show hints of a love interest and this only adds depth to the characters. Each character in the show has their own little story going on even the pet bird! With each viewing, I find myself-picking up on a different character's motivations and story and it only increases my enjoyment of ToraDora!  
Enjoyment/Overall: 
I can not recommend this show enough to anyone who likes a good anime. This series has just about everything someone could ask for. There is love, action, character development, comedy, seriousness and everything in between. I know a lot of people are kind of down on the slice of live/love drama anime shows at the moment but this is not one of the shows you want to ignore. I would put ToraDora on top of my anime list and I am so glad I gave it a chance. I will certainly be adding this to the list of anime shows that I will be watching again in the future. As the show ended I just found myself-begging for just a little bit more and I am sure a lot of people will feel the exact same way!! So if you are on the fence about watching ToraDora...... Do it, stop debating and just watch it because it will be well worth your time!!! 
Follow Up: It has now been over a year since I watched this show for the first time and I can honestly say I have seen it at least 6 times. It has become one of my go to shows for a lazy day in or when I am stuck in a hotel traveling for work. I can honestly say I like this show more now than when I wrote my original review! This one is a fun time! It's one of only two anime's that I own every single episode on DVD. I also picked up the Manga recently so I am planning on jumping into those soon which will probably lead to another viewing of the show at some point.",9
"
                There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece, but I just want to let you know if you're reading this that I believe that out of any anime this one deserves your time the most. This is just my experience but I found Toradora! to be more compelling than any anime has ever been before. This show I'd recommend to anyone because of it's sheer general appeal.
In the end, it's up to you; whether you watch it, like it, love it, it all depends on what you feel. I can just hope you feel the same enjoyment I experienced
                  while watching Toradora!",10

                Story [10/10]:
This story is an absolutely remarkable tale of love. This anime made me feel so many emotions that I thought my heart was going to melt out of my body and my soul would transcend to the next plane of existence. There were so many times in this anime that everything started to go properly and then bad again and flipping back and forth between good things and bad things and it was a huge emotional roller coaster. Overall the way that all the characters evolve and form relationships with one another is told in such a coherent and heartwarming way that I could
                  not help but to give the story a perfect rating.

The art wasn't too different from your traditional anime style but I did find it to be a very appealing part of Toradora. Although odd at first glance, there were many times when the art style simply popped out and was absolutely beautiful. An example of this is in the Christmas episodes, everything is so bright and lively and gives such a warm feeling to the audience and it is one of my favorite episodes in the whole series as well as a turning point. The animation style is smooth and has very eye grabbing moments when the scene begins to get intense.
Sound [10/10]:
Every little tune in this anime assists its comedic and romantic nature perfectly. I loved the intro and the outro sequences throughout the entire anime and they always put me in a warm and fuzzy mood before the show starts. Sound isn't the best thing this anime has to offer but it is exceptionally well done.
Character [10/10]:
Every character is extremely unique and has great qualities about them, even the side characters like Yasuko. Pay close attention to all the subtle hints dropped from each person and pay attention to how their attitudes change toward one another. Watching the characters grow and develop in a realistic pacing is beautiful and truly what puts this anime apart from the others. Taiga, Takasu, Kitamura, Kawashima, and Kushieda make this anime shine as they evolve as characters and create nests within your heart as each of them unravel and show the best and worst sides of them.
Enjoyment [10/10]:
When I first began watching this anime, I had honestly expected nothing special. The episodes seemed bland and very standard, like something I had seen before. However, as the anime developed I realized that it was a unique experience, not just an anime, but as an experience in life. This show is romantic and funny, it is about friendship, family, and growth. I believe that everyone could find enjoyment from this anime, and might even be something that can be watched to get you introduced to anime if you have never seen anything before. I strongly recommend it and I am sure I will re-watch this series in the future because of how heartwarming it is.",10
"
                There are not a lot of anime that make me cry. I get upset and overwhelmed with feelings, but I usually don't cry. The anime in my favorites on my profile all made me cry at some point or another and that's why they are my favorites. 
Toradora made me cry. I cannot tell you why, or where specifically. But once I finished the anime I was an emotional mess. The ending, which I will not spoil, is just so heartwarming and sweet, so maybe that's why. 
Anyways. The story is about Ryuuji, a high school softie who is feared just because of his face.
                  He runs into a girl named Taiga Aisaka on the first day of school. After a mix up she does by putting a love letter in the wrong bag, they discover that they both harbor feelings for the others best friend. They agree to help each other get with the person of their dreams, but will it work? 
It's a pretty original idea. Usually school romances are just about a girl/ guy who likes a guy/girl and their friends try to help them win that person affection. In the end it turns out the other person always did like them or eventually fell for them and it's happily ever after. The best part about this show is that it shows the beginning of their relationship to the very end. It's nice to see the duo like someone else before eventually realizing that they have feelings for each other, because that does happen in real life. 
The one main complaint I have is the second half of the story. I feel the light-hearted aspects of the first half were replaced with such a dark and almost dramatic tone. It was well done, sure, but they could've kept the light-hearted idea instead of just dropping this whole angsty and dramatic bomb on us. However, that didn't pull me from the story at all. 
All of the characters are a lot of fun. Taiga is one of my favorite characters ever, as well as Kishinuma, her first crush. All five of the main characters are very dynamic and complez characters, and don't all necessarily stick into the stereotypes of a nerd, or the athletic girl, or the tsundere. They have relatable personalities. 
This anime is really a lot of fun to watch. Maybe the dramatic middle of the story is a bit to much, but it will not take away from the story. It's really a bittersweet anime, and one of my favorite school romances ever. I recommend anyone to watch it if they enjoy the genre",9
"
                Ryuji is a teenage boy in high school. He isn't exactly well-liked, due to the physical traits that he got from his father, which makes him come off and dangerous and difficult to approach. In spite of this, he has friends, one of whom he's had a crush on for a long time; Minorin Kushieda. He's far too shy to tell her, and never really plans to, until he meets the ""palmtop tiger"" Taiga. After accidentally receiving a love letter that Taiga had planned on giving to her own crush; Ryuji's close friend, Kitamura, she breaks into his house and tries to steal the letter
                  back. In the end, they strike up a deal: in exchange for not killing Ryuji, he'll help her confess to Kitamura (as well as supply her with free meals), and eventually, Taiga also helps Ryuji confess his love to Minorin. 
On the surface, this is a fairly simple concept. It's been done a million and one times, and it's easy to guess the rough outcome from the beginning. Toradora manages to evolve into a very different and quite frankly, downright adorable show. The characters all grow in a believable manner, the humour is well-done, and overall, it just has a lot of heart, and that's what really makes the series work. However, like I said before, this story has been done again and again, and in some ways, Toradora does not stray too far from the typical romantic comedy formula, and can be a bit predictable, but it really makes up for it with all the things it does right.
Another thing Toradora does from time to time is try to be dramatic. Now, in a lot of romantic comedies, this means instant failure, but this isn't really the case here. For the most part, the drama is actually really well-done. Some scenes can hit or miss, but for the most part, they are genuinely heart-warming and well-done. 
The characters are the heart and soul of Toradora. Each of the five main characters are developed well, and are quite complex. The best example of a multi-layered character in this series is probably Ryuji's crush, Minorin. She at first comes off as quite the stereo typical little character, happy, energetic, athletic, but soon starts to show her true colours, and some of the things she ends up doing for her friends' sake is rather heart-warming. The protagonist, Ryuji is a nice guy who cares a lot about his friends and family, and likes to keep his problems to himself. He's also a bit thick when it comes to other people's emotions, and as much as he tries his best, he ends up failing a lot when it comes to dealing with other people. Taiga is also very well developed, but for sake of spoilers, I won't dive too much into that. Kitamura is probably one of the funniest nerds in fiction, and he doesn't even appear to be trying. He's also nearly as thick as Ryuji, but that usually just ends in hilarity. The final main character, Ami, comes in a bit later, and again, I won't get into her character, as not to spoil too much. The supporting characters are mostly just gag characters, which are funny, mind you, but not much more than that. The funniest one is probably the main characters' homeroom teacher, Yuri, whose middle aged and single, and the ways she reacts to some of the things the kids do is just hilarious. Another main character I would like to mention is Noto, who can't seem to decide what colour his glasses are. They're always changing. One second they're yellow, the next they're green, then red. I guess that's the animator's fault, though. 
This, of course, brings us to the art and animation section of the review. The art in Toradora is very good. The character designs are simple, but fit the characters and their personalities well enough. The animation is well done, but not exactly exceptional. When it tries hard, though, it's evident, and the series does have it's moments where it looks absolutely phenomenal, particularly in some of the more dramatic scenes later in the series. 
The music is Toradora tends to be rather average for the most part. It's easy to miss if you aren't paying attention, save for one track that tends to play over and over and over, and maybe one other. This can't be said about the two opening themes, though, which fit the series extremely well. The first one ""Pre-parade"" fits the characters, and how they are portrayed in the first half of the series perfectly. The second opening, ""Silky heart"" is also quite strong. Furthermore, both will be stuck in your head for days on end. The endings are pretty standard, and nothing to write home about. 
This is where I usually talk about the English dub and Japanese dub of the series. I can't to that here. Because, despite the fact that this show is licensed and available in North America, it never received and English dub, so I can only speak for the Japanese voice acting. Well, it's excellent. Each actor plays their role well, the main cast capturing the multiple layers of their character well.  Kugimiya Rie does an exceptional job as Taiga, especially. Overall, it's just a solid listen. 
Overall, Toradora is a good, and even great show, despite having a basic story that's been done to death. It leans on the predictable side sometimes, and the ending will disappoint a lot of people, but its flaws can be easily forgiven for all the series does right. The characters are loveable, the show is genuinely funny, and even pulls off drama well for the most part, and for that reason, it's highly recommended.",9
"
                An anime overflowing with cliches... All presented wonderfully. The term cliche is generally only evoked by consumers of media in a negative light. I'm fairly guilty of this myself. To call something cliche is usually to call it unoriginal or intensely formulaic. Neither is the case for Toradora! yet it still is packed with cliche character archetypes. Each of these characters, however, are extremely well written and executed in unique ways. They act only in ways their personality and experiences would lead them to act, never breaking character for plot convenience.
Toradora! does an excellent job of highlighting the difference between a teenage crush, formed from
                  admiring someone from afar for either their appearance or apparent personality and an actual love, built over time from knowing a person and interacting with them, as is highlighted with the main characters, but also additionally with the side character Kitamura's romantic interests as the series unfolds. If I could offer any criticism of the way this is handled, it might be that it seems somewhat rushed at times, however this is clearly to allow other characters some screen time in order for us to get to know them and see their own personalities and relationships evolve within a limited number of episodes.
The art style is not my personal cup of tea, but this is simply a matter of preference entirely. What is not a matter of preference however is art and animation quality and both are consistently good. The art never wavers too far from it's style and is consistently good, whilst the animation is good, with certain scenes even being truly fantastic, such as the fight scenes that take place in a few parts of the anime. The fight scenes also feature stellar fight choreography; a wonderful mix of realism and over-the-top dramatic flare. The sound design doesn't particularly stand out among the greats, but it serves it purpose well, to lend to the emotion and weight of any given scene.",9
"
                Story: It's an anime about two protagonists that are trying to help each other get with their friends. The story theme has been done before, but it does a very good job of staying fresh with different character personalities.
Art: I think the art is very nice. The colors are vibrant and bright. Not really an art buff so can't really say much else.
Sound: I love the soundtrack for this anime. It is amazing. I love the background music to the point where I have gone out of my way to listen to it when I'm doing homework. The OST always suits the mood of the
                  scenes and they do a good job of that.
Character: They have very unique characters in this anime. They have unexpected personalities that aren't typically a staple in most anime. Each character has a certain depth to them. For example, I have never seen an anime with a main character depicted as a delinquent and not having those qualities. (I'm sure it has been done before, but if so I am not cultured enough)
Enjoyment: VERY enjoyable. It is very funny at unexpected times. Great moments. There are times you will laugh and times where you will cry. 
Overall an AMAZING anime and one definitely worth watching. Or re-watching. Once or three times. I definitely would watch again.",9
"
                PLOT and STORY LINE
Oh, High School, what a great time. Considering the fact that I am a senior now, Toradora really made me cry in the end.  It's a slice of life, comedy,  school and romance anime produced by Genco (Sword Art Online, Elfen Lied) scored with a 8,48 on My Anime List. In my opinion, the prefect score for this anime. But what is it now about?
In the beginning you meet our two protagonists: Aisaka Taiga and Takasu Ryuuji. Aisaka is the typical Tsundere character you see in a lot anime everyday. Although looking cute and innocent, she is a very tough
                  person with a short temper. Ryuuji on the other hand, has a facial expression of a delinquent and people usually avoid contact with him, but he is a lovely and caring person that loves simple things in life. After the oh so popular Tiger vs. Dragon incident, they finally meet each other and come up with a pact. They decide to help each other by being the wing-men for each other. And that's where the whole drama and fun starts in a never ending comedy.
Toradora, was for me boring in the beginning and as said in the intro it took me some time to finish it. Still the first half is kinda important for the future development of the whole story. But one thing is for sure. Toradora will make you laugh so much you'll start crying in the end. All the high school drama and Taiga's actions and characteristics alone are so hilarious and really cheer you up. Seriously, after watching a couple of episodes you automatically feel a lot better. After One Punch-Man, this is definitely the funniest anime I have watched.
The reason I loved Toradora this much, are mainly the everyday happenings that are actually part of life of every high-school student. All the drama, the fights, the heart breaks, the ""problems"", the relationships with parents and so on. They are all part of one anime that makes you remember your own good old high school days. 
When it comes to romance, I don't want to say too much because it would spoil the whole story and I don't want that. (FIRST RULE of World of Anime Girl: NO SPOILERS!) The thing I can say is that it will be a: ""I never expected this to happen"" situation. A great but awesome plot twist. 
On the whole, Toradora is a cute, interesting romance and school-life story with no plot holes and a smooth story line. I found it interesting, more in the other half but still, it doesn't change the overall impression.
CHARACTERS
Dear makers of Toradora,
Thanks for this truly amazing characters.
Yours Sincerely,
-Anime Girl
Not only were they amazing and unique, they were also so interesting and let's say relatable. You really find a bit of your self in them. Now I don't want to go over every character in this anime but the two main are a must. Ladies first:
AISAKA TAIGA
Guys, I love this girl as a character. She was given the nickname Palmtop Tiger because of her short height and the brutal way she often acts. Still she looks like a cute little doll, as described by Ryuuji. The reason I loved this anime and Taiga alone was because I kinda see my self so much in her. We are both short, still cute, and I do act sometimes like a tsundere. Yet we care about persons close to us but are lazy as hell. Essentially, Taiga gets upset easily and is considerably clumsy. She lives alone in an apartment without her family because her parents are divorced and her father, with whome she has lived so far, has a new wife. After becoming close to Ryuuji she spents most of the time at his house. 
RYUUJI TAKASU
I sometimes feel so sorry for this guy. He is such a nice, caring, lovely and smart guy and just because of his eyes everybody thinks he's a delinquent or sth. like that. But he does look creepy. Never mind that, as a result he often looses self-confidence especially when he's in front of the girl he likes. Ryuuji lives alone with his mother. Due to this he has lernt to be self-sufficient  and has no problem with cooking, cleaning and other house chores. He is a very caring person, and often puts someone else in front of him self. He's such a good guy! 
ANIMATION and STYLE
The animation of Toradora is quite satisfying and the style is also very good. I just realized how hard it is to fill this review section with words. I mean there is nothing much to talk about. So, that would be it. I guess. 
CONCLUSION
Toradora is an awesome slice of life, teenage, school and romance anime for a lazy Sunday like this one today. It relaxes, it amuses, it makes you laugh. Can't be any better. So if you are bored and don't have anything better to do, gogoanime.tv and start Tordaora today. You won't regret it.",8
"
                This is an Opinion, not a Review.
i don’t use to rate 9 or 10. 
if i do, there must be some few factors that justify it.
Toradora really is worth an “ 8 “ 
but:
• It teaches some strong lessons, which are actually useful 
• It gets to the point, the ending is very conclusive as far as we are concerned • It was made in 2008 (to me, it is relevant)
• we already know what will happen, yet we don’t know how it will happen,
   the show still works… 
• Great first opening, contains many memories about the show, if i will listen
   again I'm sure i will remember",9
"
                ** Introduction ** Do you want to watch this? - NO SPOILERS
The anime takes place in a typical japanese high school setting with the story being about two teenagers, Ai Saka and Riuji, who are both in love with one of their class mates trying to help each other out. 
This obiously also leads to the both of them getting to know each other better. 
The thing is that Ai Saka is somewhat Tsundere whereas there is very little of the ""dere"" (being nice) until very late into the anime. That means she behaves really mean most of the time opposing to Riuji who is
                  basically a nice guy. 
If you want to watch a story about a guy who is really nice no matter how others treat him and how this relationship develops, this anime might be interesting for you. However, if you think there should be a limit to how nice one should be if others are not behaving, then this anime might freak you out because you might not be able to relate to the characters because you think that their traits are way to exaggerated. 
** Review ** - SPOILERS AHEAD - DON'T READ IF YOU DID NOT WATCH THE ANIME YET
Narrative:
The plot of the anime is obviously focused on pushing the relationship of the characters. The largest part of the anime is slice of life, which is a good option for naturally developing the personality of the characters. 
One problem with the narrative is that sometimes characters do not even seem to listen reasonably. One example for this is the confession of Tiger to Kitamura, who basically ignores what Tiger has to say and sticks with his own assumptions even though, as revealed later, he already confessed to Tiger earlier. He is smart enough to get what Tiger is saying, even though it is a bit fuzzy, and he does not need to read between the liens for getting what she is saying.
The thing is that the story builds up the relationship between Tiger and Riuji as having a relationship between brother and sister, which might somewhat justify why it is acceptable that Tiger treats Ruiji like a trashcan. 
Riuji seems to have feelings for Kushieda until the very end, when Kitamura and Kushieda forcefully try to ship Tiger and Riuji. He literally does not think about Tiger as a potential girlfriend on his own. Even on Christmas Eve he is totally focused on Minori, however he is very unsatisfied that Tiger did leave the party which leads to him running after her which suggests that he feels responsible for her but not that he changed his mind regarding his romantic interests. Just think about how he desperately tried to convince Minori to come to the party. Probably if Tiger convinced Minori to come to the party, and she did not leave afterwards, both Riuji and Minori would have ended up together. 
The end also feels unreasonable, rushed as well as exaggerated. 
**Character**
Riuji: 
I think Riuji is a reasonably good characters. He has his own special personally traits, notably his kindness and his urge to keep everything clean. Due to his personality, he cares about each and every of the side characters. Basically, Riuji is the force which strives to develop the characters of the other characters. He seems to be manipulated into loving tiger, ignoring his own feelings due to being pressured too much. However, this is not his fault. 
Tiger:
The problem I see with Tiger is that she is really abusive, even hurting other characters for no reason. I think she literally punched every character except Minori bringing them visible physical pain. Additionally, she always demands others to do something for her, never asks, and rarely thanks for anything. It is fine that Tiger is dependent on others, but it is his not find that she portrays it, as it is the job of Riuji to take care of her. She doesn't even seem to treat Riuji as a friend, even after more than 10 episodes. Some step towards treating Riuji more like Monori, especially after being somewhat close for more than one year,  would have made up a lot. 
Note that she only reason she starts being nice later on is because of Christmas. I simply dislike this sudden (temporal) character change. It just too much. 
Minori: 
I really like the character of Minori as being mostly always cheerful and happy, as well as being super dedicated and being a good friend on top of that. But it is not like Minori is perfect, which is a good thing. She is really confused regarding the relationship between Tiger and Riuji and does not know how to handle her own feelings. The only thing which annoys me is that she dumped Riuji because she wanted to ship her with Tiger. It would have been fine to argue that she can't date him because she can't bear seeing Tiger after doing that. But she justifies her decision basically by saying that she would take Riuji away from Tiger, which is nonsense considering that both Tiger and Riuji were making it very clear that Riuji is interested in her i.e. it is not about taking him away it is about that his feelings deep in his heart are not meant for Tiger (at least not romantically). 
Ami:
In my opinion, the most interesting character if the show. One might say that the is sneaky and manipulative, even after her confrontation with her stalker. This is certainly true, but she does it for other reasons that before. At first, Ami just seemed to have fun playing with the feelings of others. However, she develops as the only character who really gets what going on, especially later on by using her metaphor of the happy family, consisting of The Child (Minori), The Dad (Riuji) and Tiger (The Mom). She is not primarily focused on her own interests, but on using her confrontational personality type to clearly bring up her opinion. E.g. consider the scene of Ami confronting Minori on the ski trip about dumping Riuji. Yes, she totally exposed her in front of the other girls. But that is because she knows that something is going awfully wrong. 
She shows some about of affection towards Riuji which has a good reason. Despite Kitamura, he is the only boy who recognized her for whom she really it, not for being a model. Her interest also shows the shy side of her, always teasing her interests but not offensively taking action. Honestly, I would have loved to get more insight in the behind the scenes i.e. what she is thinking, what she is not saying. 
Kitamura:
Even though I did not like how he seemed to be somewhat dull about getting Tigers feelings, I really like how he developed, shifting his interest to the president. This might actually even be the reason why he did not want to get what Tiger said, but I am not sure if this way the intention of the writer. There is simply no evidence to back up this reasoning. 
He is kind of a ""box of surprised"". I like how he is unpredictable sometimes doing weird stuff e.g. running around without a shirt which does not necessarily need further reasoning. 
**Summary**
Toradora is an anime with a lot of missed potential. It might be possible that actions are explained way better in the Manga / the visual novel, but I do not think it is possible to justify the overall narrative according to the character's overall behaviour. 
Note: Silky Heart is a really nice opening, especially the Italian version by Thymeka
Otherwise: art / music is not the focus of this review",5
"
                I really enjoyed this anime, It is by far one of the best romantic anime's out there. I highly recommend this to fellow anime lovers. This anime is emotional at times, which just adds to how great it is. By the end of the show, I was in tears, it does such a good job at hitting you right in the feels. Most of the show is more of a comedy rather than a drama, but the ending is where it starts to come around. The art style is in fact, really good, and the characters are really easy to love. They all have good
                  personalities, and designs. They did a really good job capturing this high school romance.",10
"
                Ah, Toradora. What can I say about this anime? Let me first address the one thing I absolutely can't stand - the freaking drama. Don't get me wrong, I know it's impossible to find a romance without drama, especially a SCHOOL romance. Still, Toradora seems to have more drama than necessary. It's annoying, but the characters and story make up for it. I usually don't like female characters, but I LOVE Taiga. She's so adorable and I love her personality. It's safe to say she's the ONLY female I like in this show (though the teacher isn't half bad, either). Honestly, I love the relationship
                  between Taiga and Ryuuji - I ship it so hard. They are so beautiful together, and they have such a strong, loving bond. It's the second best anime relationship ever (the first being Sawako and Shouta). When there's not drama happening, it feels pretty light-hearted and funny. Definitely worth it's salt, and easily a 10!",10
"
                I don't like romantic comedies. Don't like it at all. North-American and even my country (Brazil) productions have assured that these genre is not for me at all. Is cheesy, childish, clichéed and always have terrible acting and directing. So, why a guy like me have searched Toradora to watch? I think it was by its fame.
And man, it was a thrilling emotional journey. Now that I've finished a great marathon that took weeks, I can say with no problem: Toradora is the definitive romance comedy and the greatest love story I've ever get un touch in my life. And now I explain to you
                  why. 
The review will contain MAJOR SPOILERS of several parts of the show, so if you did not seen it, go to Crunchyroll right now. 
STORY- 10/10
I will begin with a statement that will be polemic: Toradora is the younger brother of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Yes, you read it right. Like the classic, Toradora focus is not the plot, is the character development. Toradora is not a show about unlikely lovers, is a show about human relations; like EVA is not about post apocalyptic batlles, is about human relations. We know in the second episode how it is going to end. Is not difficult to know that. The great thing of the show is the journey we see to get to these logical conclusion. And the questions that emerge in this way. 
Toradora is a great character study focused in the repression of feelings, the barriers we put among each other and the masks we wear to be more relatable with our equals. Is about also being true to your own feelings and being yourself, despite the others pression. It doesn't have the depressive weight EVA has, is more comic and lighthearted, but is no less realistic. It treats the humans relations and feelings with all the realistic weight they deserve. And this is what is great about it. Is a realistic study about adolescence and about human beings. Every dilemma, pain, joy and personality trace is explained and is rooted in our reality. And even so, is developed with a great combination between drama and comedy. Is a little, and also glourious, tale about life as it is. About friendship, family, schoolife, and people. The screewriting is just great, and combine situations and reflections about life magisterially. Seeing it as an adult, after have gone through various situations the caracters are going and seeing it addressed so beutifully real was really a great experience. 
Among all these merits, Toradora also is a study about romantic love as it is. Romantic love is not doing crazy stuff to conquer the one you love, is not waiting for the soulmate or the prince riding a white horse as the ocidental pop culture told us since always. Romantic love is ordinary, is about being atraccted to the one who really care about it, is in the small things, small acts and the uncommitted words. Is more close to the family love, or friends love than the books  and movies have teached you. Is about care so much about one person that let the feelings go is better them jump in the love swimming pool. Toradora understand love like few. Is not philosophical, is not fantastic. Is just a thing that come and go soflty. 
Of course it have cliché scenes and situations, but these are apllied in the correct way and context, so, it's great to see how the screenwriting timing was right and perfect. 
I really liked the approach it had on these themes. But the show would be nothing without its characters.
CHARACTERS- 10/10
I always say that characters are the soul of an ficctional work. So, a great writer must respect them and show who they are, what they want, where they come from and where they want to go. And Toradora masters it. 
Let's start with Minorin, the happy-go-lucky girl of the main gang. Is she really the funny driven force, the one who doesn't care about small stuff, the one that is never hurt? No. She wears a mask and an armour of bright joy. As the show goes, we can see her frightened and insecure side, and how strong these side is. Also, we see a girl in the edge of a nervous breakdown, as she repress these ""bad"" feelings and want to show her light side to be loved. And also learns that open the heart is the best thing to do. 
Kitamura also learns important lessons on his development. As member of the student council, he is always looking for the best to his friends, colleagues and fellow students. But, how we can see in the student council president arc, he sometimes forget about himself, his desires. So, he has a huge fear of not achieve what he really wants. This arc is extremely important to see how even the biggest heart of gold has it issues, his desapointments and his broken dreams. 
Now we get in one of the greatest characters in anime multiverse, Ami Kawashima. As a famous teenager top model, Ami is the center of all atentions of class 2-C.  But, despite all her popularity she's lonely among the others (how the great metaphor of the show, her favorite spot in between two soda machines can show us) and also emulates being a more pleasant person. She passes through the greatest change in the whole show, when she realizes that can be accepted the way she is, mostly by how Ryuuji behaves with her and sees who she realy is: not the mature queen bee, but a child seeking for acceptance. After the incident with the stalker in episode 6, she becomes more true to his real self and also more able to see through the walls and masks the others use to protect themselves. So, we see a new Ami rose from the ashes, more assertive and with the mission to make people supress less their feelings, specially her friends. The problem is that can bring pain, not only for they, but to herself too.
We have also other great secondary characters that help to develop the themes of the show. I think the ones who catched more my attention were Ryuuji's Mother Yuu and the love as sacrifice for the others, the former student council president Sumire, who shows that love is not doing crazy stuff, and Haruta, a class coleague that behaves himself as a perv but has a very interestanting secret. 
But the spolight is always with the main protagonists of the show, Ryuuji and Taiga. The first one starts as the standart protagonist, a guy who don't like himself, is kind of weird but has a great heart. Ryuuji evolves to somenthing else, to a great human being who is the glue of the gang. Despite viewing his family as not what he wants to be, he starts to see it as a place of love and safety, and to valorize the small things that his convivence with mother, friends and Taiga  can bring. 
So we get to the Queen of Tsunderes. I love when a tsundere is well developed and has reasons do act as she acts. The agressive behaviour of Taiga, as of Asuka Langley Soryu in Evangelion, has an realistic explanation: she cames from a disfunctional family where her parents seens to not care about her. Besides it, she hates how small she is, trusts no one in the beginnig of the series by fear of being rejected or ridicularized, and just thinks that no one will ever care about her. As the story progresses and she gets more envolved with his friends, specially Ryuuji, and even becomes popular with the other school kids, the Palmtop Tiger finally sees her importance as a human being and how great she is. But her arc is not complete. That explain her desapearence act in the last episode: to fullfill hapiness she must show her new self to her family and finaly make bonds with them, showing not only her evolution, but her emotional maturity. 
So, with characters like these ones, is impossible to not fell in love with this show. 
ART- 7/10
The greatest problem in the show is the animation. It have its great moments but most of the part is not so good as the other aspects. The greatest problem though is the charachter design. Even if the mai ones get a good art, the rest of the cast sometimes is a ctrl c ctrl v, lazy art. But it not commits the quality of the show. 
SOUND - 8/10
The sound effects are pretty good on this show, and are used more to build great comic situations. The OST is also very good, remarcable in various moments, but a little bit repetitive. The openings and endings are simply fantastic, catchy songs that express very well the tone of the show. 
PERSONAL ENJOYMENT AND OVERALL- 10/10
Despite the few mistakes in the technical issues, I had a hell of a emotional journey watching the unfold of Toradora. From a guy that don't like romantic comedies, see this one as one of his favorite anime of all time is just amazing. The combination of plot, character development and realism is just so well done that i really feel better for the experience I had. Is a small masterpiece about the small things that we do and that have a great impact in our lives and the lives of others. Is a show that is mandatory not only to every anime fan, but also to every human being, adult or teenager, that want to learn about life. The power of Toradora will stay in the heart of everyone that watches it.",10
"
                Toradora's story may not be profound or unpredictable... but it is well written. 
The characters may be ordinary and even outright annoying at times... but they are relatable. 
Yes yes, there are unrealistic moments, the plotline is cliche, the art is average... but trust me it's very enjoyable!
Toradora can make you laugh out loud with its humour and make you cry with its heartbreaking moments. It begins as a good ""wholesome rom-com"" and rises above that with its dramatic 2nd half. Most of the characters are well developed despite its 25 episode short length. 
In short, if you're looking for something revolutionary or fresh, feel
                  free to skip Toradora but if you're willing to look past its common tropes, get ready for a captivating ride!",7
"
                Toradora! Takes the traditional comedy/romance genre and delivers. The anime consistently provides fresh content and three dimensional characters (especially later on). The story may be a classic theme, but the interplay of drama, comedy, and romance creates something beautiful. Unlike many other anime of this nature, this one isn't ""episodic"" like the others. Rather, the characters and the issues consistently build as the show progresses. The art in this anime is great, especially the animations, but it isn't as ""outstanding"" as the story. Sound wise, besides the intro and outro music (which are both catchy) there is only the traditional ambience that plays. Overall,
 this
                  anime is one of the best. From the three dimensional characters to the excellent writing, you can't go wrong here.",10
"
                Toradora is one of those anime that overstays its welcome close to the mid-way point, and by the time the climax arrived, I was somewhat underwhelmed. A lot of the characters lose whatever charm they originally had and said charm is replaced with heaps upon heaps of melodrama. The whole ""scary-looking nice guy and short, fiery girl are the outcasts of the class"" seemed to have been shelved fairly early into the show, and I felt like they could have spent some more time on this gimmick. I think the only reason I liked Taiga throughout was because she was both cute and I wanted
                  her to find her happiness. Ryuji's long-running struggles to win Kushieda's affections grows old after around the beach house episodes, and actually found this (a good chunk of the show) to be the most-poorly executed aspect of the show. Their dynamic was the weakest, with Ryuji's ineptitude to talk to his crush and Kushieda's over-exuberance/quirkiness. Kitamura and Ami had brief flashes of development but stayed fairly stagnant after their arcs. 
Story aside, the art style became equally as grating over time. I got very tired of the moe-blob sameface syndrome that everyone but Taiga and Ryuji had, and the dated animation does it no favors either. Ultimately, it may have been a good romance story at the time Toradora aired over 10 years ago, but has been eclipsed by several other stories since then.",5
"
                This anime is by far the best story I ever watched. Even though from the first episode you know how it's going to end, It's the journey this story takes getting there. I haven't seen an anime that made me feel for the characters as much as this one. 
A huge shout out to Yuyuko Takemiya for writing this masterpiece.
Even though I think my heart can't take anymore romance anime's at the moment. I'm defiantly going to watch other anime's written by her. 
As you can see I gave it a 10/10 because I felt like it really played out like a perfect story.

                Story 7 Art  Sound 6 Character 9 Enjoyment 5 Overall 6
The Art and Sound are nothing special, and the ending of the series makes Toradora! somewhat disjointed. However, the tsundere character of Taiga is fleshed out very well.
The Story is based on a light novel, which can be read on baka-tsuki, and has a comprehensive storyline. While individual characters are fleshed out well, the relationships end up falling short, as does the comedy. The series is geared partially towards comedy, but gets more serious and more focused on romance as the story progresses.

"
                For me, Toradora is the embodiment of the word Mediocre, I kinda get why people praise it, but also I totally agree with the criticism it gets
First, let me start with the good
I/ Main characters are not that bad and are actually interesting, I liked the personality of Taiga and Ryuuji, and their interactions with each other is actually interesting, also the other cast are not badly developed and they have some uniqueness in their personalities.
II/ The story started pretty decently, it did a nice job at introducing character personalities and the world-building was on point.
well that's about it. Now let's get into the bad,
                  so buckle up!
I/ as I said, the beginning of the anime was satisfying, well sadly that didn't last for long, I felt that the anime started throwing random drama, the setup of the drama plots were badly written and made absolutely zero sense, it's mostly overreaction of certain events (looking at you Kitamura and kamou) that could've been easily avoided/fixed by using a certain trait called COMMUNICATION.
II/ ever had the experience before where you argued with your friend about who will pay the restaurant bills out of courtesy's sake?,  that's how I felt with the love triangle, square, pentagon??, hexagon????, CIRCLE???????, oh mrs.A and mrs.B have a crush on Mr.C?, well just imagine the restaurant example and switch yourself and ur friend with mrs.A and mrs.B respectively, then the bill with "" capitulating your love interest with mr.C"", and u'll know what I mean, hope I made my point xD
ENDING SPOILERS HERE
III/ now I have three major problems with the ending, first one, the protagonists running away, this was super random and unnecessary, it made absolutely ZERO sense, the second one, they freaking proposed marriage in the most unrealistic, random moment I've ever seen, they literally started dating, ran away, then proposed AT THE SAME DAY, like wtf???, and finally oh boy, after Ryuji fixed his beef with his mother and they returned home, taiga suddenly had the revolutionary, enlightening idea of ""well fuck this shit I'm out"", she freaking RAN AWAY AGAIN and abandoned Ryuji after getting proposed and kissed each other, WHYY???, now this doesn't end here, at the graduation ceremony (which I assume took place after months) she randomly ""spawned"" in the closet, and was like HEY I'M BACK UWU, and ryuuji was, oh hey welcome back!!!! smily fucking face, then he said "" i lub u""..................... WHATTT?????
TLDR: I liked episodes 1 - 12, they weren't bad, but then random drama started to happen and it made no sense, the ending was pretty bad lol.
5/ 10",5
"
                This anime is absolutely amazing, and is very realistic in a sense. While most anime set in high school seem very repetitive, Toradora! gives the exact opposite. It's idea has been used before, but its brought to the table with a freshness. It is a very consistent story.
The characters become very well developed from beginning to end. and I found myself wanting to learn more and more about each character in this anime. They each have their own secrets, weaknesses and very different personalities, and they all mature throughout the story.
Toradora! also has beautiful art. I especially enjoyed the different looks to all the characters,
                  instead of them all looking overly similar. 
Overall, I enjoyed this show and highly recommend it to anyone, even those that don't usually watch the romantic comedy genre. It has very relate-able characters and is not an anime to simply pass by due to its genre.",10
"
                I found Toradora! quite a long time ago (at the early stages of my anime watcher ""career"") but I decided not to watch it since it seemed a bit stupid,I don't know why :D After I watched Shakugan no Shana I saw that the same voice actress did Aisaka Taiga and I felt like finally checking out this anime.First off I think that the way they met is super cute and they were just right for each other.Taiga is a complete tsundere but I love her.And Ryuuji....I don't think I'll ever have the pleasure to have a guy take such good care for me (I
                  mean..he freaking made breast pads for her swimsuit lol) I love how comfortable they feel around each other and their friendship.Everything happens for a reason.Things don't work out with their crushes but they end up finding one another.The story seems very cheesy but there are also serious moments.The most powerful moment for me is Taiga's realization.
The story is easy to predict but the details make it interesting and exciting to see.I like how Taiga is referred to as ""palmtop tiger"" it suits her really well.And there's a meaning behind one of the quotes ""Since ancient times, the dragon has been the only beast to equal the tiger"". The tiger is obviously Taiga and Ryuu (taken from Ryuuji) meand dragon in Japanese.That really makes it kinda special to me.And the name Toradora is taken from Tora (tiger in Japanese) and Doragon (Japanese EngRish pronounciation for dragon) Just a little disclaimer:when you finish the last episode don't hurry to turn it off cause there's more after the credits.Lots of people get confused and don't see the true ending.
I loved Toradora! It doesn't seem special but it's still very unique in its own way.The music is very childish but for some reason I like listening to Silky heart and Orenji which brings back memories.Thanks for reading my review,hope I helped :)",9
"
                Why do I watch romantic anime?
To feel all warm and fuzzy inside. For those hearty moments where the characters slowly discover their feelings for each other. For when they suffer from angst and uncertainty until the inevitable collision of feelings finally happens. For when they end up in each others arms.
On a realism scale, I rate toradora 7 out of 10.
Taiga is a tsundere character at heart (rightfully referred to as the best one), frequently becoming violent. She is still a very lovable character who develops greatly and for me the main reason to watch the show. There is also a stupid, speaking parrot for
                  comic relief and the always sleepy/seductive mom of Ryuuji. At times you will laugh or shrug at wierd, more or less funny situations that it seems only anime writers could come up with.
What stands out are the 5 main characters, their interactions and their development.
MINOR SPOILERS (you can still watch it after reading):
The story is summarized as follows:
Taiga and Ryuuji meet and decide to help each other with their respective love interests. Naturally, as everyone already knows, they grow to love each other instead, which takes some time to set in. It is however not the story itself that is original, but rather the sensible and very rewarding execution. Both characters grow up quite a bit and come to many realizations during the course of the show.
As events unfold and develop, we get to see the characters feelings develop over their crushes, until the first ""bang"" happens in episode 8 in the form of Taiga  exclaiming her ""ownership"" over her ""dog"" Ryuuji (who nearly drowned in the pool) in tears in front of everyone. While exclaiming her ownership may not seem romantic at first, her tears gave a more accurate represntation of her feelings.
However, the next ~11 episodes, everything resumes back to normal and they more or less both go on about their days, with Ryuuji trying to pursue his own love interest, Minori (Taiga's best friend), when arguably one of the best episodes comes along: the christmas episode.
Here, Ryuuji is being his usual oblivious self and comforting Taiga, who spends Christmas Eve alone.
However, Taiga begins to realize her true feelings and this is followed by a tragic, beautiful moment, supported by the best track in the OST and worth all the build up to that point.
After that, nothing is the same, and everything gets concluded slowly, but yet so heartbreakingly well and satisfying over the last 6 episodes.
The last episode includes one of the best scenes I have seen from romantic anime, but I choose to ignore the controversial second half of it.
If I had to name a flaw, maybe it is that the whole premise is based on our main guy, Ryuuji, being completely oblivious to what is going on most of the time, but I did not care one bit: the homely day to day scenarios, the surprisingly great and deep character developments and the romantic conclusion made me completely overlook that.
So if you, like me, want to find out how exactly Ryuuji and Taiga end up together, do not hesitate one second to watch toradora.",9
"
                Toradora is great, sweet. Romance is genuine and the character development feels natural.
Now that's out of the way, Toradora's charm for me all were found in moments outside of Taiga and Ryuuji. The scenes pertaining to family, abandonment, and themes of isolation in times of insecurity is what really brought out the tissues. A lot of these themes play powerful roles in the development and understanding we have of the protagonist and resonated with me on a very personal level.
Toradora isn't just an anime about love, but provides us with notions of platonic love, brotherly love, family love, and unconditional love.
This anime is special and
                  has a special place in my heart and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.",10
"
                Yo, Im new to this animelist thing and this is my first review ever because when i finished toradora, i couldnt stop thinking about how awesome this anime is, yet i felt empty at the end of it because of some characters that werent really given a proper ending, and if you watched it, you know who i mean..... lol
Story: 8
The story is your typical love story slice of life comedy type show, at least at first it seems that way. Boy likes girl, girl likes boy, boy helps girl get her life and vice versa. So at first you think its the same old
                  love story anime, and thats where toradora shines. It chooses another path to that love story, and gives a few twists and turns along the way. The only downside is you can see the ""twists"" coming, and the fact that even though this is a really good story, it isnt amazing and doesnt do anything SUPER different than what you can find in other love stories. Also, while the ending was cute and good, i feel like it didnt leave all the answers to my questions answered... for example, what did they do afterwards, which sadly, we can only imagine.... or read the light novel lol
Art: 9
Everything looks good, all the characters look well made.....except the background characters that look waaaayyyyyy average..... and the setting and colors really make everything look nice and gives it a awesome atmosphere. Nothing is ugly, the only problem with the art is ofcourse, it doesnt do anything amazingly different and the characters look like they would in any anime... still good though.
Sound:10
What can i say, amazing. The OSTs are just brilliant, every thing fits with the scenes and never feels out of place, some give you feelings of sadness while others give you feelings of rooting for the characters to do something epic. The opening and endings for both seasons are very well done, and my fave opening and ending is probably the second season ones, and the voice actors...... Kitamura Eri as ami......... OMFG!!!!!!!!! (huge fan of her voice acting skills :))
Characters: 9
The characters are all just awesome, and most of them have great character development, even the support characters are likable, some of them at least lol. The downsides are... well... taiga is basically a tsundere, nuff said. Then we have Ami, who in my opinion, doesnt get the screen time she really deserves, shes in every episode, but she doesnt even have many interactions with ryuji which are really meaningful, which sucks because she is a mysterious character at first, and it takes time to really figure her out, definitely my fave. Then we have minori, who at first is the HAPPIEST GIRL ALIVE, then takes a huge 180.... at the end, i feel like shes the one who got the worst...and saddest... conclusion.. right next to ami.... But the rest of the characters were great and likable, especially taiga once she really changes near the end.
Enjoyment: 10
Once i started watching, i couldnt stop, i watched the whole serious in one night/morning, and i loved it, i seriously laughed and teared up, and im a guy. I seriously loved all the characters, and ofcourse ami the most, and the ending, while i cant say was the best, was seriously cute and happy in a way, i enjoyed this serious from beginning to end. Though the ending really makes me feel empty inside since some questions remained unanswered.
Overall: 9
While not perfect, this is an AMAZING anime, very few problems really bring it down from perfection. The ending which was good, i feel wasnt presented to the best it could have been. Some characters werent given the ending they deserved, and leaves questions that asks what happened to them after the anime. Otherwise, everything is perfect in my eyes, while not the best story ever, this is a really heartwarming anime to watch, and i highly recommend it.
Note: this is my first review so sorry if it wasnt really presented the best lol.",9
"
                Spoiler free:
One of the greatest anime of all time, especially standing at the apex of the Romance and Drama category specifically. 
A bit slow for the first few episodes, perhaps this is one of the flaws of old-school character development that requires the reader's attention to build up pace. But this anime will absolutely tear you apart and pull at your heartstrings no matter the person. 
Toradora! perfected the extremely difficult art of putting the viewer in their feels over and over again like a melodic rollercoaster. It builds up the suspense and crashes it all down like a wonderfully crafted lego tower. Towards the
                  end of the show, you will see the full culmination that this anime has to offer, putting together all the pieces you thought were irrelevant. It is a beautifully executed climax and one of the most complete but bittersweet endings you will ever experience.
This anime is truly a masterpiece and I would never go back on my word of putting Toradora! in my top 5 best written anime of all time.",10
"
                I first watched this anime when I was about 14 but now that i'm older I decided to re-watch it and I now remember how much I love this anime. To keep it short the anime is amazing but there is a couple tiny little things I would change. For example one of the characters takes up about 2 episodes having a mental breakdown over a girl he likes that we don't even really know like that. How does the anime expect me to care when I don't even know the girl he likes that well. 
(Spoilers from here) Kitamura is a very nice character
                  but not very well written, him clearly not liking Taiga but still flirting and leading her on really annoyed me. To go along with that I loved the ending but it left me wanting more, we only really got like 2 episodes of Taiga and Ryuji being an actual couple. If they gave us a little more to the ending and handled kitamura's relationship problems better then it would be an easy 10. 
The animation is great, the music is amazing, and I couldn't stop watching after finishing just one episode. Still love this anime, definitely watch it if you haven't. Both the sub and dub are great!

"
                The anime is pretty well made and the visuals are stunning in most part.
.:|~!Spoilers!~|:.
But I feel that the story is just plain weak. I noticed it in the 19th episode. All this time I was hoping for a nice side character X main character and got my hopes up in the series. Then suddenly while Taiga had just been so angry at the Ex-President and beat her up cause she loves Kitamura and now she is crying that she has feelings for Ryuuji.
I have seen the same thing in a lot of series and it goes against everything for me. I`m sure it will end
                  in a lousy way now with Taiga and Ryuji confessing or what ever.
It just makes me sad that this stuff happens, can`t the writer be a little more creative and not end the story like so many other animes? 
I just hope everything will go as I want it, although I seriously doubt it.
.:|~!Spoilers End!~|:.
The story was weak and the characters werent taught of too well.
I know a lot of other anime fans would agree that the delinquent looking main character with a soft heart is getting old and whats worse some noisy girl with hormones bursting out like a volcanol ,who dosen`t know what she wants gets together with the main character in the end.
But as stated the art and enjoyment were pretty fair.
I would recommend this anime if you want to watch a light-hearted love story.
But if you agree with me on the subject then be prepared for a disappointment ,at the end at least.",8
"
                Toradora! is the embodiment of ""Will they?/Won't They?"" You spend the entire series wanting to almost yell at the characters because misconceptions and issues keep popping up left and right which have fairly simple solutions which the viewer can instantly solve as soon as the issue comes up. ""Character A! Do this, not that! Character B! Stop being so arrogant and just cooperate!"" Bias aside, I'm sure that's what makes an anime good, maybe it's just a pet peeve of mine when it comes to romance anime. Let me just say that I LOVE romance anime, it is absolutely my favorite genre, but I tend
                  to see similar elements in every one that usually leaves me frustrated or unsatisfied. I have yet to find an anime where I am actually 100% satisfied with the ending.
Story: 6
Toradora! is the story about two highschool students who begin helping each other with their crushes, but each attempt is even more unsuccessful than the last. Along the way, they slowly start to care for one another, secretly developing romantic feelings. The plot is straight forward and enjoyable, but there's definitely better ones out there.
Art: 7
The visuals of Toradora! are unique; I find myself seeing differences in the art style in every anime I watch rather than thinking that because two thinks look alike, they are the same thing. Toradora! is the anime that has finally made me realize how much you pay attention to the details of the environment. With that being said, Toradora! is visually appealing, but nothing worth mentioning, other than that it's ""good.""
Sound: 6
The music found in Toradora! is very generic, nothing entirely outstanding. The only thing saving this category from getting a 5 or 4 was the first opening theme, Pre Parade.
Characters: 9
Toradora!'s best feature are its characters. While all of them do have cliches, as does every show nowadays, Toradora! managed to spin those cliches into something much more. This is one of those few anime where the characters actually feel real. Yes, at first, when being introduced to the characters, you believe that all of them are just walking cliches. But Toradora! is very misleading in this aspect: as we see our characters interact more and more with each other, feelings and relationships begin to blossom, change, and crumble. The character development in Toradora! really takes the audience by surprise.
Enjoyment: 8
Even after giving the majority of the show's aspects sub-par ratings, I couldn't help but coming back for more; my intrigue only seemed to raise after each episode, especially the ones that would end on cliffhangers. The character development in Toradora! is amazing and continues to draw the viewer in.
Overall: 7
Toradora! may have it's flaws (especially it's forgettable ending) but it isn't bad at all. In fact, it's good, it's definitely worth a watch. I enjoyed it, even if I was left with an unsatisfying ending, but still, there are better romance anime. Still, give Toradora! a view when you have time to kill.",7
"
                Perfection....Absolutely perfect.
When I say it I mean it, every single character will grow onto you. At the start there might be a character that you don't like but....that will 100% change.
Ryuuji, taiga, and all of their friends will grow on to you and make you want more when it eventually ends. I cant even describe how good this anime is. Every characters story is unique and everyone has a unique personality which just makes it feel so authentic. 
7 hours after finishing the anime and I still feel like there is a hole in my heart wanting more, so id rate it 10/10, I literally
                  couldn't find anything wrong with the anime and I would recommend it to literally anyone and to anyone with a special spot in their heart for love",10
"
                As a rom-com maniac, I must say that Toradora! will always be on my top 3 rom-com anime list. Why? The plot, if you want to explain it, is pretty simple, delinquent looking nice main male with the strong looking but pure  main female falling in love while trying to help each other finding happiness from the supportive character. Which is a really common plot to be honest, but along it added the typical ""Tsundere and the nice guy"" factor and carried it out amazingly and which not alot of rom-com has done. What I'm trying to say here is that not just the
                  plot, but the details of all the characters is carried out vividly and the viewers can almost guess every step he/she is going to do next, but the occasional plot twists just makes them even more entertaining and draws you into this anime deeper and deeper. You want funny moments that makes you laugh your tears out? Toradora! have those. You want scenes that's so touchy that all you can think of is ""feels feels feels""? Toradora! has them all. If you are like me, a rom-com maniac, this is a must watch, pure comedy lover? watch this, you won't regret this, romance lovers, same goes for you lots.",9
"
                Review in brief:  Toradora! is full of the usual high-school rom-com tropes and clichés, yet it not only succeeds but excels at nearly everything it works towards.  It doesn’t contain those tropes just because they’re standard; it knows how & why they were meant to be used in the first place and uses them to their fullest.  By tying them together with a strong central theme, Toradora! becomes an excellent journey crafted out of familiar story elements.
Review in full:  The premise of Toradora! is simple; it’s a high school rom-com in which the main characters are trying to hook each other
                  up with their best friends, as they each happen to have crushes on the other's friend.  It’s a premise that surprises nobody, and it doesn’t take much thought to correctly guess how things will end up.  If you don’t know who the main characters end up with by the end of episode 2 then you simply had to have missed something.  At this point Toradora! may sound like a waste of time, but that would be deciding that a cake tastes bad based only on its shape.  The “main romance” elements are basically given to the audience from the get-go because they are only a setup for the real goal of Toradora!, and that is to cultivate a character drama around the concept of self-honesty within the artificial world we know as “high-school”.
It starts with the characters, both main & side. On the surface they are quite tropey and in many ways just what you’d expect out of this genre of anime. In this way they also tend to have exaggerated physical and emotional features, emphasizing their feelings and antics towards the other characters. However, in time it is shown that these “typical” behaviors are, much like the rest of high school society, a façade, within which vulnerable teenage self-identities hide in fear and feared personas are cast into by those less caring. These characters aren’t the standard templates they initially appear to be; they are actually defined by their thought processes and emotional reaction points. This refreshing form of characterization is the path that allows what at first is just a typical rom-com cast to grow into the central theme of self-honesty. It’s why the exaggerative covers are there in the first place; the slew of templated, cutout characters in anime’s ubiquitous high-school setting can easily give us viewers the depressing expectation that they’re almost all cover and no book.
Toradora! also makes great use of its generic setting and story arcs therein.  It proudly features the anime-school staples: festivals, P.E. swimming, the beachside summer house, and a field trip so blatantly opposite to the norm that it’s a joke.  Unlike lesser school anime that merely use these to run their characters through the typical thematic jokes and leave it at that (“It’s high-school, surely you didn’t expect something different!”) Toradora! makes a point of using each situation to allow its characters to bond through necessitated teamwork, enter environments where they’re more willing to peel back their fronts a little, and create moments that snowball over the course of the show to become dramatic scenarios of their own later on.
Because of this, no matter how predictable or generic the main story elements get, Toradora! is always able to deliver a dramatic experience, witty comedy, or even both at the same time via multi-layered character-driven interactions.  My only real complaint is that Kitamura's arc could have been handled better.  Up to that point in the story, Kitamura's character and development were a little lacking for how much weight was put on his handling of his situation.  Still, it's nothing too serious and succeeds in building the setup for the rest of the show.
Toradora! is also doubly entertaining, allowing it to appeal to a wide range of expectations.  Firstly, its pace is maintained via arcs of 2-3 episodes, long enough to make each arc matter without dragging any scenarios or plot elements out longer than necessary.  Secondly, it possesses a decidedly silly flavor of humor.  Most of Toradora!’s comedy doesn't derive from situations or misunderstandings between characters (as one would expect from the genre) but most often just the characters goofing around and having a good time, especially where the outwardly enthusiastic characters are involved.  Not that those other forms of comedy can’t be effective (otherwise one would think that they’d be far less common) but Toradora!’s comedy is innately refreshing.  By allowing the characters to simply act as they are within these silly moments instead of following a rigid joke scenario it fosters an air of genuineness that gives the whole show a special charm and occasionally even sees characters develop through comedy.
Even the production values of Toradora! end up amounting to more than they initially appear.  With its clear and effective use of both color palettes and emotive animation to reflect each scene’s mood, the visual artistry does everything it needs to do  to make the end result shine.  Of particular note are the dramatic sequences with highly controlled frame-rates, emulating a live-action movie to great effect.  The sound (especially the voice acting) is just about a perfect match, with distinct and lively voice acting for nearly every character and catchy music that captures the mood from a high schooler’s mind noticeably well.
Now it must be said that many people who dislike the show cite a disdain for Taiga's violent and reactive character.  If you don't like her it will likely detract from your enjoyment.  For me, having known people who were surprisingly similar was enough to accept her when she wasn’t likable and led to her growing on me over time, which seems to have been the author’s intention.  I can say with confidence that Taiga's character is exaggerated to the same degree as the other main characters and didn't come off as comically strange or unnatural to me like other violent tsun-type characters tend to.
Verdict:  On the surface, Toradora! is a generic high-school rom-com with a standard premise and a cliché & predictable outcome.  Dig deeper and it discards those notions when it turns out to be an intricately developed character drama, complete with moments both tender and lighthearted.  It shows us that something doesn't have to be one-of-a-kind to be truly beautiful, special, or even unique.  At the end of the day the journey can mean as much as or even more than the destination it leads to.  That is Toradora! ~ a whimsical adventure in a familiar neighborhood.
Side note:  This review, in part, was made to present the topics discussed in the MAL blog article “Toradora: Maturity and cliché” by Awesomecake with spoiler-free wording.  If you’ve already seen Toradora! and want to know more about its underlying themes I highly recommend giving her article a read.

                I am of the opinion that stereotypes can be a good foundation for a character - as long as they grow out of it. Toradora nailed this.
The cast begins with an unremarkable list of tropes, but most of them grow out of it over the course of the story. The become deep and dynamic, and the interactions between them can range from hilarious to heartbreaking, but are always entertaining. Even if I disliked some of them at first (*ahem* Taiga), I grew to love them by the time the series was half way through.
My favorite character, and probably one of the best parts of Toradora,
                  is Ami. She is the most complex character in the entire show. She is shaped and changed by the people around her just as much as she shapes and changes those very people. She has many layers: a sweet exterior and a mean spirit beneath that, but at her very core, she is thoughtful, mature, and strong. Her character is something new, and it makes everything else feel new too.
Most of the drama in Toradora achieves it's goal: it creates tension and emotion without feeling forced. This is pretty consistent until the ending, where it feels as if the creators were grasping for some sort of climax to add to the show. It ends up being forced, with characters making decisions that don't really make sense and mostly just overreacting to the situation. It's disappointing that the drama was done so well up until that point, and then it kind of falls apart. The ending is still somewhat satisfying. Loose ends are tied, but there's nothing to write home about. 
Other than that, the visuals are smooth and fitting for the show, and the music is decent. It's a great anime for anyone who likes a rom-com with well-written characters.",9
"
                My girlfriend wished to watch the show with me. And while I realized this is on of the ""I fell in love with the person who will definitely reject me"" Series, I don't have actually a problem with the thematic or Romance/Slice of Life in general. I lenjoyed Nagi no Asakura and Glasslip, also two Series with a similar thematic of falling in love with the person you will most likely never date.
But there was something I disliked throughout my time with Toradora. I was, and this is really uncommon, stressed. Yes, I was annoyed by a lot of Characters. Yes, it is the structure
                  of the Series that the Characters behave sometimes stupid or naive, but Toradora is a whole different Level. What annoyed me most was, Characters like Minori were the most part hyperactive or even way to aggressive. The Series is very good in to teach you, when you have problems, just run away everything will fix from itself in the end.
Of course there are a lot of good things in Toradora too. Yes, with the exception of Minori, the Characters are quite likeable. The Queen of Tsundere, Taiga, is cute enough to continue watching the show (but she too is very complicated at times). The Animations are quite nice considering it's a show from 2008 with 25 Episodes. The Animations are fluid and the Character-Designs extreme solid. But there is a chance you will confuse Ami with Sumire sometimes.
The story itself can be told in about 13 Episodes or less. There are enough Clichés to fill a bathtub. There isn't enough interesting developments when it comes to the Characters. But especially after watching Nage no Asakura, which ending was highly disappointing, you will get a reward at the end of Toradora. It may not what you wished for, but the ending is kinda cute in some ways.
Verdict:
I may give the Light Novel a shot, but I don't think this will be a whole different experience. Toradora is a solid Anime. It would be more enjoyable if the Characters would behave a litte smoother. Like I said, they are stressful and overly complicated/overreacting. Maybe the Series is a little more for the female watchers because they are able to understand the female Characters better. But most likely, it was just my own taste here. All in all, give the Series a chance if you like the Genre, but don't expect anything new here. In my opinion, you will find a lot of Series in this Genre which will add more to your enjoyment.",6
"
                Oh, Toradora. Despite the obvious endgame couple, this show was sufficiently entertaining to watch (IMO, a lot more entertaining in the first half of the show). 
For me, it had a lot of potential, but this was dimmed by a couple of screw-ups along the way. Over-the-top drama (in the latter half; and despite the obvious attempts in inducing your tear ducts to give, it failed to make mine do so), too much deliberate withholding of information, and many times a shoddy attempt at making mystery and more fleshed out characters. Well, mostly my complaints about this show came to surface in the way they
                  chose to bring the story to a close. By then everything just seemed so forced to me. 
*minor spoiler ahead, if you can still consider such a spolier*
At the beginning I was so entranced by Taiga and Ryuji's chemistry and I couldn't wait until they got into terms with their feelings - but by the time this had happened, I couldn't really care less anymore because of the events leading to it. IMO, they bombed the last couple of episodes. 
But anyway, this was a decent show. I actually finished it and I'm not a huge fan of the genre. So go on ahead, give it a try. Perhaps I just didn't like the latter half because I kinda hate overdone drama. It may float your boat though, so don't take my word for it. :)",7
"
                This anime was pretty much love triangle three folded. The basic story of a guy falling in love with a girl and that girl’s friend having a crush on his friend. Are you confused already? Ya, that’s pretty much how this anime is. The story is predictable, at least in terms of point A to B. The trip in getting to point B though is what was so enjoyable about this show. They had times where they had typical episodes other slice of life romance shows have; the occasional swimsuit, the misunderstandings between characters, the Christmas and valentines day episodes, and then there were times
                  where they actually turned it around and made it new. The show really turned out good because they kept with what made a romantic comedy what it was yet added or changed small aspects so we wouldn’t get bored of the same old thing.
The characters are pretty generic in my opinion but I think it might because I have seen so many slice of life romance shows set within a high school. While the characters do have their perks that make them their own, some of the ways they deal with situations is very predictable. The first person we have to talk about is Ryuji; a very straight forward and easy going guy who people think is a delinquent because of his looks. For most romance animes I have seen with the guy as the main character, the guy always seems to end up as the generic. A guy that the person watching can put themselves into their shoes. This naturally makes the character feel very plain and boring if you’re not making it about yourself. Ryuji is different, feeling as though he actually is his own personality. He is a home maker and has a really really strong obsession with cleaning (where the hell is this guy in my life? I so need him to clean my house). 
On the other hand, Taiga is a complete opposite to him, with her lack of cleanliness and being unable to do basic housework (though they don’t explain if its just her being lazy or if she doesn’t know how to). Her small stature and fiery temper is why she is nicknamed the ‘Palmtop Tiger’ and also why she and Ryuji seem to end up in quite a bit of fights and misunderstandings. The only two people she doesn’t fight with is her best friend Minori (who is Ryuji’s love interest), and Yusaku (Taiga’s love interest). 
Now I’m going to lump Minori and Yusaku in the same sort of category, the happy go lucky friendship category. They are the only reason why Ryuji and Taiga hang out together since their best friends are the other’s love interest. Almost every time you see the two, they are fooling around, acting strange, or just having a lot of fun. They are the kind of friends I could probably hang out with for a little bit but will wear on my nerves fast when they start going crazy. When I first started watching the show, I couldn’t stand Minori, unsure just why Ryuji was so head over heals for her but as the show kept going on she kind of grew on me. Same for Yusaku who I liked in the first part, started to feel annoyed with in the middle, then fell in love with his character near the end. 
The artwork is very generic as much as the characters were, with the art matching the mood. If it was comedic, then the art had a more loose based design while during the romantic scenes, they would add a little more detail into it. Although the designs sometimes changed, they still kept the very bright and colorful atmosphere normally associated with 2000s anime selection. 
The voice acting was pretty good, using mostly voice actors I don’t normally see often. Erik Kimerer did a great job on Ryuji making him not feel like just a flat personality, Cassandra Morris played Taiga, and Christine Cabanos did a rather good job with Minori. The only big name I could really see for the main characters would be Johnny Yong Bosch who played Yusaku. It took me a couple minutes to pick him out as I knew the voice was familiar but I think it was very easy when Yusaku was doing something crazy. I kept thinking of Vash when Yusaku was doing the crazy scenes. 
So what did I think of this show? I actually really enjoyed it. It was fun, and although predictable, the points that weren’t made it feel fresh. It’s definitely one that you should check out if you’re into romantic comedies.",6
"
                This movie was a great relaxing show.  By relaxing I don't mean boring as there were plenty of times I had to put down everything I was doing and totally engage in what was happening.  There were other episodes that were perfect for doing school while watching.  I just really got to love the characters.  The story itself is decent enough, but it's really the characters that make this show great.  Yes, great is a word I would use to describe this one.  I had a great time for what it was.  The animation was really good as
                  well.  I watched the English dub and the voice acting was definitely up to par.
So the ending.  I actually really liked it.  I would say it was adorable, but I enjoyed i on a level that was more than adorable despite the fact that it was predictable.  Again, the story isn't amazing.  If I were to use one word to describe this show, it would be ""satisfactory"".  It satisfied basically everything I wanted from it.  I can't ask for more than that.",7
"
                (May include subtle spoilers) 
Loads of potential, but the main problem with this show is that it does not fully utilize each and everyone of the characters' shortcomings. Instead it relies on the major characteristics of the characters instead of giving the characters more depth. For example, a lot of important details about the characters were overlooked when the plot was getting more and more complex. These include things such as background and general biases when talking about the type of characters in the show. For example, although Ryuji was supposedly a responsible, yet immature, character, the creators could give him more depth by talking
                  a lot about Ryuji's feelings about his family background early on. This would make the anime more consistent. 
(spoilers incoming)
The ending was pretty bad as the anime became extremely emotive when it came to the character's making decisions and expressing themselves. This was a huge contrast from the beginning where the show was relying a lot on each characters' individual motives, and portraying a lot of their decisions to abide by some sort of moral code that each character had built in their lives. Furthermore, the supporting characters became more and more obsolete when nearing the end of the show, and it felt a lot like the creators were trying to push in everything together. 
The only personal issue I have with the anime is that it tries so hard to bring about each characters' shortcomings, that at the very end, it felt like the conclusion of the anime was something born because of the main characters' flaws. I have a problem with this personally because I think this anime was more suited towards having a conclusion where each character got what they set out to get, and I think that this anime's biggest failure was the conclusion. It felt very forced and the sudden change in emotions became something extremely unsettling in the show, and ruined the atmosphere when a lot of the drama climaxed.",7
"
                Toradora is a cute anime. The shoujou touch is just right, it's not too petty. The story keeps getting better and better as you watch it. The characters are cute.
              ",8
"
                Story
Toradora followed a pretty coherent story; two people, Taiga and Ryuuji, had a crush on the other's respective bestfriends. It may be simple as that, but I'm telling you, it will be far more complicated. Comedy is mostly on point, as the characters have their own quirks. Pacing is also excellent. A lot will happen in one episode most of the time, so it will force you (in a good way) to brainstorm into predicting what will happen next. But somehow, your predictions will be so wrong. This is what I like about Toradora, it will not go with your expectations (except for that blatantly
                  obvious message that they're shoving right in front of our face, but I'll spoil if I'll say what it is) and it's refreshing like that as few animes can do that and still be satisfying to watch.
However, this series cannot resist the urge in using tropes. Luckily it keeps it at a minimum so I can tolerate that. There is also an episode or two in which may not be a filler, but it feels kind of forced for me. Another is that there is also one major plot hole that this anime haven't managed to fix. Altogether, these are the reasons of why I put the Story a 9 instead of a perfect 10.
Art
I've got to say, Toradora has one of the best, if not the best, art quality in its time. The animation movements are so fluid and the characters are drawn in detail, especially in close-up shots. Heck I can screenshot those (the remaster version ofc) and make it into my wallpaper. That's how good it is. While it may get left behind with today's and future animes in terms of art quality, it is for that same fact that will help you be able to distinguish that Toradora is from the 2007-2010 era; the last era when 480p is the standard of anime.
Sound
From the extremely catchy Pre-Parade to the hidden message-riddled My Silky Heart, Toradora has one of the most memorable soundtracks for me. Again, one of the strongest points of the series is its beautiful music and their excellent timing in using those, adding more impact to both of the scenes and the song themselves (looking at you Lost my Pieces and Ame Iro Rondo). Voice actors are also very fitting on the type of voice they used on the characters.
Character
The character department is the reason why I said the story had its own share of tropes. The main characters fit in the well-known archetypes, BUT they are much more than that which will be shown later into the series. The show also has a narrator, and it's one of the characters here so we can hear their side of the story and thoughts on that situation. However, because of this we can't hear the versions of the other characters. So it's a give and take. Most of the main characters (for me at least)  have had huge character growth, which is also a big plus. So when watching this, please do take notice of the main characters' lines, the tone on how they spoke of it, body language, and their reactions (both the facial and their bodies') to grasp on what they are thinking / feeling, and why are they doing that / come up with that decision. Also there are items here that symbolizes a certain part of the character. The show has A LOT of subtleties here, so be sure to look out for those.
Enjoyment
I really liked this series, I liked it so much that I decided to make a review for the first time. I can't even imagine that I will be grown attached to all of the main characters and just wish for all them to be happy. God I punched a wall a few times just to be a man again. 10/10 would buy a hardcopy of this series just to have a reminder that this is one of the best series in its genre. I would rewatch this sometime too, probably later this year.",9
"
                Please bear with me, I binged 10 episodes of this anime today.
Toradora is obviously the kind of anime you might expect from a school life type of deal. It's got your rom-com, your everyday struggles, et cetera. However, there are many things that this anime does well that others fail to do. Toradora isn't just a story following the lives of high schoolers; it's a story about life, and how you must keep on going no matter what happens.
Story: The story of Toradora begins fairly simple - Ryuuji meets a short girl named Taiga, and they both seem to have a bit of a dilemma.
                  Both of them like each other's friends. This situation allows for the two to form a sort of alliance, which was going to dissipate after they hook up each other with their friends. However, we already knew that it wouldn't end up being that way. The first part does a great job building up the characters and the story, but it doesn't compare to the richness of the second half. I like to think of the start of the second half being after the festival, which is when all the conflicts start. Without getting spoiler heavy, the second half is full of all the love problems, which are handled in a way that helps build characters up too. Without taking up space that should be used for the character section, I'll end it at that.
Art: Seeing how this anime was made is 2008, the art has held up well. Obviously, as it is a Slice of Life anime, the art isn't the main focus, but that doesn't stop it from having its moments. The 2nd ending song in particular is great at showcasing art, with a completely different art style being used.
Sound: When watching anime, the voice acting is obviously an important part. In Toradora, the voice acting feels as if it's not acting at certain times (i.e: breakdowns that involve love). The opening theme song and ending songs are strange when taking the lyrics out of context, but they provide another layer of connection to this anime. By making the op/ed songs have lyrics that make no sense, it really feels as if it's a metaphor for life, since everything is unexpected, like the lyrics itself.
Character: As stated above, the characters in Toradora are given lots of time to grow and develop, and are almost to the point where you couldn't list all the personality traits within these characters. The character developments hit hard in the second half, allowing for a rich and deep understanding of these characters. For example, Ryuuji. Ryuuji is a character who I couldn't describe in a couple of sentences without missing a lot of details. Even though he is a main character, and lots of development should be expected, the amount put into even the sub characters is a lot. Especially when watching the second half, I could see that new parts to these characters emerged, like when Ryuuji stressed over a certain thing from the Christmas episode, or when Minorin started fighting with Ami. Anyways, making this short, the writers did an amazing job developing these characters.
Enjoyment: Toradora was a trip, in my opinion. It started out a bit slow at the start, allowing for new characters to slowly appear and show their importance. However, after that halfway mark, the conflicts grew numerous. With these conflicts, I was kept at the edge of my seat, wanting to know what was going to be the next move that happened. 
I think that I've gone over all the points that I'd like to cover. But anyways, let me say some more things about this anime. Toradora is one of the better SoL animes that I've sat down to watch. There aren't really any faults that I can find in this anime, and that includes the story (which usually has at least one plothole). Now, I'm not saying that it's perfect, but I am saying that this anime is something that I recommend watching (even though I recommend everything I review hahaha).
Have fun, and go watch some anime.
Edit: turns out I missed an episode, but they truly invested in the rom part at the end",9

"
                This anime was top quality. No other anime has ever caught my attention like this one. I was sucked in from begining to end but I digress. Toradora is a drama, romantic comedy which revloves around 2 main characters, Ryuji and Taiga. Ryuji is a nice guy who is a bit of neat freak who is also known as a delinquent due to his  eyes which make him look like a murderer and has a crush on Taigas best friend, Minori. Tiaga has the nickname of palmtop tiger and is easliy gets angry and has a reputation as a delinquent. Same goes for taiga
                  who has a crush on Ryuji's best friend Yusaku.  Taiga lives right next to Ryuji and comes from a rich family but has moved out on her own due to family issues while Ryuji lives in a small house with his mother and bird. After a brief confrontation between the 2 delinquents they decide to help each other with thier love life and overall image. As the anime goes on you will be introduced to another important character, Ami who is Yusaku childhood friend who also happens to be a model. She seems nice but is really arrogant. Through out the anime you will see each character struggle and you will learn more of each character. Theres no, aliens, secret lives or anything of that sort. Just these 5 characters and other minor characters who are involved towards the end of the anime. I enjoyed watching this from beginning to end. Unlike other anime in this area this one really caught my attention. Like any media for it to be good it has to get you emotionaly involved and thats what exactly this anime did for me. So I highly recommend this.",9
"
                I don't really know why did I watch this anime till the end cause it gave me no enjoyment or entertainment at all. 
Story was just like the most of the school-romance animes. There was a guy who scared people by his look cause people don't see the real person in him. That's true for our female main character too. People scared of her cause they didn't know the real herself from the beginning. Then those two people met and suddenly everything else started to went differently. Of course there were lots of love triangles. 
I like the artwork of this anime since it's made
                  by Anohana's studio. Character appearances seem so similiar to Anohana and Darling in the Franxx to me. Colors were bright too.
I personally don't like the openings and endings. I just watched them once and pressed skip the intro button real fast for other episodes. Soundtracks were not really felt like they suit the scenes time to time. 
I really hate all the characters expect Kawashima. The main characters were so boring and annoying to watch. Especially Taiga the main female. I think people don't fall for ""Oh no, no one loves me even tho I literally have infinite friends. They just don't understand me."" types of characters anymore.
This anime is a rom-com but the comedy part doesn't seem entertaining to me. Jokes were just too bad. I trembled by the feeling of cringe with my whole body everytime they tried to make a joke or a funny scene.
So, this anime was not entertaining and the character storys were cliche, jokes were not funny and the ending had nothing to do with the whole story they were trying to tell through the episodes other than episode 24-25. It was a waste of time.",4
"
                When I started this anime, I only wanted to have a nice time, knowing that slice of life animes are the best to relax and enjoy a simple pleasure. But in the end, I found more than that in this anime.I even had a tear in my eye at some point. I was expected a comedy, but to me, this one is clearly more of a romance one (despite some hilarious moments). 
The story, even though it's quite simple and predictable, is really one of the best asset of this anime. It begins slowly but gain in strength progressively and pack a lot of emotions
                  throughout the series. The genre ""Slice of life"" is perfectly represented here. The story narrates classic school's events, allowing the viewer to recognize themselves through it. It's just plain simple, but work remarkably well! I wouldn't like any change to it, really!
The end is very satisfactory, even if a bit too unpredictable (which to my mind stands out too much from the rest of the anime).
The drawings doesn't stand much from others ""romance"" kind of anime, but fits perfectly with the genre. I like the way the characters are depicted, and the animations are really good and lively.
Overall, the soundtrack is nice, but not particularly memorable. The four openings/endings are enjoyable but honestly I skipped them almost every time because I was in a hurry to learn more about the story. Despite everything, dramatic moments are well deserved with beautiful music, and some themes come back at the right moment to convey the right emotion.
 However, the Japanese voices are just perfect for me. Recognizable (even tough I don't understand much of Japanese) and well fitted.
The characters are no doubt the other great asset of this anime. They are endearing as hell! Nothing in their personality feels wrong or too much. They are human, with their qualities and drawback. Even if some their of their traits are exaggerated, it's nothing unusual for an anime, so it's okay.
Well, in the end I can't say that I'm disappointed. This anime masters perfectly the ""romance"" genre, and knows how to touch the strings of the heart. I'm sure it will please every amateur of the genre, and I would advise this one (as well as Clannad in the same kind) for those who would like to take the step!
Alternating funny and more dramatic moments, it carries the viewer without any problems during those 25 episodes. The end feels just right and I was even surprised by the amount of emotions on the last few episodes.  
To me, the success of a romance anime is a question of balance. And this is exactly what I found in this one. The length is good, we never really get bored and the plot advance progressively (which is to my mind the good strategy for a romance). The only few mistakes for me could be a little loss of rhythm between the 5 and 10 episodes and an ultimate plotwist in the end that might have been avoided. But overall, those details are just not enough to remove any pleasure! Well done Toradora! Il'' give you 9.5!",9
"
                This anime was amazing! I enjoy romance as a sub-plot, but I don't typically like stories focused centrally on romance. That opinion might be changing though as this and Kimi no na wa are two of my favorite anime. I also really enjoyed the American movie La La Land, but I digress. Toradora was a great anime with great characters and good pacing.
Side note: For some reason Toradora is labeled as a slice of life anime, BUT IT IS NOT! A slice of life anime would mean that each episode is a slice out of the characters' lives, as in there's a new conflict every
                  episode. One episode might be about clothes shopping while the next might be about going to an amusement park. If something major happens it might last another episode or two but usually events are contained into an episode each. That's what a slice of life is. Toradora is not a slice of life. Toradora has clear story arcs, they may only last a few episodes each, but they are each important to character development and the overall story of the show. 
Anyway, onto the main review (as Toradora is an 8 year old show, I bet most people have already stated these opinions or opinions similar to them, but whatever)
Story (10/10)
Toradora had an amazing story that I enjoyed deeply. I mainly started it because one of my friends would never shut up about it and I had nothing better to watch. The first episode I felt was ok but nothing really outstanding. I decided to stick with it though because it did show some potential and by episode 3 I was completely hooked. One of my favorite parts of the story was how it climaxes. It starts off as a simple ""Hey, we have crushes on each other's friends, lets help each other out"" but then by them end it's an insane ""holy f*** how did this happen!?""
Art (10/10)
For an 8 year old anime I feel the animation style aged very well. It is very nice and sort of pleasing to look at.
Sound (8/10)
Again for an 8 year old anime I feel it aged very well (why am I treating 2008 like it was such a long time ago with such inferior technology? lol). TBH I don't really have much to say about the art or sound and I'm only writing about it because it was in the ""rate the anime"" part up above. But they were both good though. Moving on...
Character (9/10)
The characters were amazing. They felt believable, had good character development, and reacted to situations exactly as you would expect a teenager to do (like if I was in Ryuji's shoes I'd probably do the same things). I love how deep the characters are and the layers of masks they wear to hide their true feelings, it really made me think about what was truly happening in some of the later episodes. This probably would fit better in ""story"" but I'm putting it here: I love how every character and relationship is important. Most romance stories try to make it seem like anything that doesn't directly affect the romance is unimportant. If it doesn't cause a fight, kiss, drama, or anything between the main characters, then it's unimportant. This anime isn't like that though, it shows how the romance can affect friends and family and vise-versa, it even shows some relationships and story aspects that are nearly unrelated to the romance. 
Enjoyment (10/10)
The jokes were pretty funny and like I said in the beginning of this review, I might be starting to like romance stories, because I enjoyed this one a lot. I hate to admit it, but I actually cried at the end. Well that's a lie, I really don't cry unless I'm extremely upset about something but I did feel like I could've cried and I definitely teared up a tiny bit when listening to the OST ""Lost My Pieces"" later. Unless you're like I am and you rarely cry, you'll definitely be crying during the last few episodes if you actually care about the characters and the story.
Overall (10/10)
Toradora was an amazing anime and I would definitely recommend it to anyone whether you enjoy romance or not. I really wish that the show was longer or that there was a season two or something but with what happened at the very end, the chances of the season 2 are nearly impossible, so the most we could ever hope for are the special episodes.",10
"
                First of all, I like Romantic Comedy A.K.A RomCom or LoveCome.
This anime has is so addicting, makes me shout ""Gotta Love that Tsundere""
So what I can say about this anime, The plot alone makes you wanna watch this anime to know how it will turn out. The comedies were really funny, though this has a bit of drama too.
This anime is worth watching, that's what I can say.
Story:
Well as i just said, it has a good plot. A Dragon and A Tiger where they stand equal in each other, though the Tiger treats the Dragon as a Dog. Well thats just how it is.
Even though
                  I wanna say so much, I just can't spoil the show.
So sit back, relax, and enjoy the Show. Ill guarantee you that you will enjoy watching it.",10
"
                When this series first started off, I had a hell of a problem watching this anime. No matter how hard I had searched, I could not find the episodes when they were released. Furthermore, there were many negative comments about how this show is going to be another cliche romance genre anime. However, I had not given up and continued to pursue this series, and I'm glad that I had done so as this is probably one of the best romance genre animes I had seen for the past 7 years.
Story:
School-based romance anime. There had been many animes with this setting: Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka,
                  Final Approach, School days, etc. Most of the time, the  story jumps right straight into the relationship: boy/girl likes girl/boy --> improves relationship in school events --> success. There is little or no development of the relationship between the main characters. Toradora! however, is somewhat different. From pure friendships to love, the development was done splendidly. The bond between Aisaka Taiga and Kushieda Minori. The trust between Aisaka Taiga and Takasu Ryuuji. And of course, the admirable Kawashima Ami. These made Toradora! stand out from other animes.
Edit: I've probably missed out the most important thing that makes this anime so special. The end closes perfectly and doesn't leave any unanswered questions for the audience. And like all fantastic animes, it left me empty inside after i've finished the last episode of the series. I need more Toradora!
Art:
Nothing much to say here. The art is pleasing to the eye.
Sound:
Kugimiya Rie, also the voice actress of Shana and Sanzenin Nagi. Rather self explanatory I think. Oh and the opening and ending sounds are good and fitting for the anime.
Character:
Again, Kugimiya Rie. She's the goddess that makes tsundere lovers go moe~! over Aisaka Taiga. Other than that, all the characters had been very well developed with their own unique individual personalities. They are not any common anime character you can find in another anime, where they tend to not have a very defined personality.",10
"
                this is my first review so I might be biased but hear me out.
This is by far the most annoying anime I probably ever watched and hear me out.
First of all I think 80% of people already knew where this show was going just by seeing the first episode. An annoying girl that would argue with the main protagonist and then fall in love. Like I said i probably would have dropped it by this point but I thought this would change in later episodes but I was wrong.
So I am going to do a short summary of why this is one of the most
                  annoying anime I have watched.
1. like in any anime, boys like or tolerate girls being their owner or master, cause this is exaclty what this shit is, ryuji the main protagonist, basically being her slave, I am tired of anime having boys doing and accepting anything a totally annoying girl does, Ryuji cooks for her, let's her hit him, call him a dog and other slurs etc, I could go on forever. Honestly does he not get tired of it, and this shit drags for 70% of the series.
And unlike any other anime I have never, never seen such an annoying character, and that award goes to Minori Kushieda, the pink hairded girl, I honestly do not understand how can you have someone so delusional and crazy and still want people to enjoy your anime, basically 90% of the anime she talks literal non sense and tries to act cute.  Here is an example of this:
Ryuji: do you have any plans for today kushieda
Minori: hmm let's see well I want to see ghosts and ufo sometimes because i think they really do exists( and the shit ton of random ''cute words she says'')
Apparently kushieda was in love with ryuji while for 17+ episodes our main girl protagonist Taiga was droolling over Kitamura(dude with glasses and popular).
However in 1 or 2 episdoes she somehow falls in love with ryuji.
This is review is probably really bad cause I do not know how to formulate a review,.
THIS ANIME IS very boring, has very annoying charcaters and a main protagonist that likes to be a slave then still fall in love with  Taiga, while the 2 other female charcacters who like him are afraid of saying how they fell+ note that they are very annoying",6
"
                If you don't like tsundere characters, I wouldn't recommend this anime.
Now for those curious about this, let me explain a little. This is a romance comedy and a good one at that. For me, it was the anime that got me into watching all my anime subbed from that day forward. Isn't that a life changer? Seriously, continue to watch this until the end. It has everything a romance comedy needs with some drama. The ending was nothing like I thought would happen at the time and while I predicted one part, I never seen the other part or what actually happened to well actually
                  happen.
So if your looking for something to cry and enjoy, give this your time. It's a favorite of mine for a reason and hopefully yours as well.",10
"
                --spoiler free--
This series left me speechless. I'm surprised i can even find the words to write this review right now. I watched Toradora twice. the first time it made me laugh and it occasionally made me sad. this happened when i was 15. 2 years later, this series made me laugh and it made me wander around in my room thinking ""what the hell?! how did i miss all that?! I never thought she meant THAT..."" and ""man I feel sorry for ****""
Toradora is a series you can sit back and enjoy as an (almost) carefree comedy, but it is also a series you can
                  look into.most of what is said has a back-side. a lot is ""coded"" in the context. It's in metaphors used in previous episodes, it's in the actions and faces they made before, it's in their behavior... things you don't notice at first. and it's written and executed so fucking well that... well... it left me speechless.
---story---
plain and simple. a slice of the lives of Takasu Ryuuji, Aisaka Taiga, Kitamura Yuusake and Kusieda Minori. As they fall for each other and get over it and fall again. The usual love-comedy stuff. That is not really interesting as the main plot is very predictable. the only thing holding this series together is the awesomeness of the character design, and their dialogues.
---(the awesome) character design ---
""They relay to you exactly what they feel, and you can't help but love them."" this sentence sums  it up pretty well. when they're sad, you're out there sad with them. only a handful of series, out of the dozens I've watched, managed to do that. Besides - they're lively, adorable, and make you laugh.
second great trait of the characters here is that they do not talk nonsense, no matter if you watch it for fun or dive into it looking for what's between the lines. The texts do not seem out of place. they're not random and they're not about lame, unrealistic stuff. BUT they're a little too dramatic at times, though. Drama haters - beware.
Lastly - a very special spot is reserved to the characters that make this story roll. in a weird fashion, it is not the protagonist that drives the plot forward. It's a bunch of side characters that, through what they say and do, the others act. How it is different from other animes? i cannot explain. it just is. 
---art and sound--- 
they serve the plot and characters very well, enhancing whatever you're supposed to feel, and often help define the characters' personality and thoughts.
overall - watch it. it's suitable for everyone.

                [ENG]
“Don't worry, the perfect person will appear in your life”, how many times have you heard that phrase? Year after year, this echoed in your mind, so you ended up waiting all this time for that perfection...but I'll tell you a secret, and don't spread it to anyone, okay? Everyone who told you that, each of them, was lying, or rather, they didn't tell the whole story.
Let me be clear and explain that to you. Toradora! produced in 2008 by J.C.Staff studios and Yuyuko Takemiya's original work, shows the story of Taiga Aisaka and Ryuuji Takasu, the Tiger and the Dragon, and what does that
                  perfection you heard so much in your life means
Let's go through the main characters to understand them better:
Ryuuji is a different protagonist from other Animes, considering that he's relatively normal, despite his appearance and frightening eyes, he has a heart of gold and takes care of others like a mother;
Taiga is the school's ""tough girl"", and her fame has spread all over the place, giving her the nickname ""Palmtop Tiger"", something like Pocket Tiger, referencing her size and her unusual aggressive temperament;
Minori Kushieda is the class clown, a cheerful and fun girl who doesn't matter the day or the people around her, she always manages to brighten up the environment and leave a pleasant mood;
Yusaku Kitamura is kinda similar to Minori's personality, but his appearance and composure convey the image of being someone confident and who can help you at any time;
And Ami Kawashima, the model who has just been enrolled in their school, her beauty and body stand out in the eyes of everyone present, leaving the classmates to admire how beautiful and mature she is;
Well, now let me explain the premise of the story... Ryuuji and Kitamura are best friends, Kitamura is a friend of Minori, whom Ryuuji secretly likes. Minori is Taiga's best friend, and Taiga likes Kitamura in secret, who is Ryuuji's best friend, and Ami is Kitamura's childhood friend and...
A mess, isn't it? But it's from there that Toradora begins to give us lessons about life...because that ""perfection"" will never exist, everybody is a mess, you're a mess, I'm a mess, and the characters are also a even bigger mess. Everything I've talked about so far, have you ever stopped to think that it could be a mask they use to hide who they really are?
This Anime shows the real meaning of the phrase you heard at the beginning, that this perfect person will appear in your life, but that doesn't mean that is someone without flaws, but is perfect for you. Someone with flaws, weakness, imperfections and with difficulty to remove that mask, but when you're finally together and be honest to yourselves, you'll both shine like you always should be
So, instead of standing still and watch others shine, how about remove your mask and be yourself? And when you do that, just look to your side, because just like you, I guarantee you’ll also see another jewel, ready to be polished.
Bellow there is a video link, entitled “The Perfect Person”, which better analyzes the Anime and its premise as a whole, making this review even more accurate (Please turn on the English Sub for it).
[PT-BR]
“Não se preocupa, a pessoa perfeita vai aparecer em sua vida”, quantas vezes você já ouviu essa frase? Ano após ano isso ficou gravado em sua mente, então você acabou esperando todo esse tempo por essa perfeição...mas vou te contar um segredo, e não espalha para ninguém tá? Todo mundo que contou isso para você, cada um deles, estava mentindo, ou melhor, não contaram toda a história.
Deixe-me ser um pouco mais claro e explicar isso no final das contas. Todaroda! produzido em 2008 pelos estúdios J.C.Staff e obra original de Yuyuko Takemiya, mostra em especial a história de Taiga Aisaka e Ryuuji Takasu, o Tigre e o Dragão, e o que de fato significa essa tal perfeição que tanto ouviu em sua vida.
Vamos dar uma passada nos personagens principais para entender eles melhor:
Ryuuji é um protagonista diferente de outros Animes, considerando que ele é relativamente normal, apesar de sua aparência e olhos amedrontadores, ele tem um coração de ouro e cuida dos outros como se fosse uma mãe;
Taiga é a menina mal-encarada do colégio, onde sua fama se espalhou por todos os cantos, dando-lhe o apelido de “Palmtop Tiger”, algo como Tigre de bolso, referenciando seu tamanho e o temperamento agressivo fora do normal;
Minori Kushieda é a palhaça da turma, uma menina alegre e divertida que não importa o dia ou as pessoas ao redor dela, ela sempre consegue alegrar o ambiente e deixar o clima agradável;
Yuusaku Kitamura é o que tem semblantes parecidos com a personalidade de Minori, mas sua aparência e compostura passam a imagem de ser alguém confiante e que pode te ajudar a qualquer momento;
E Ami Kawashima, a modelo que acabou de ser matriculada no colégio, onde sua beleza e corpo se destacam aos olhos de todos os presentes, restando aos colegas de classe admirarem o quão linda e madura ela é.
Bem, agora deixe-me explicar a premissa da história...Ryuuji e Kitamura são melhores amigos, Kitamura é amigo da Minori, quem Ryuuji gosta em segredo. Minori é a melhor amiga da Taiga, só que a Taiga gosta do Kitamura em segredo, que é melhor amigo do Ryuuji, e a Ami é amiga de infância do Kitamura e...
Uma bagunça, não é? Mas é a partir dai que Toradora começa a nos dar lições sobre a vida...pois essa tal “perfeição” nunca vai existir, todo mundo é uma bagunça, você é uma bagunça, eu sou uma bagunça, e os personagens também são uma bagunça ainda maior. Tudo que falei deles até então, já parou para pensar que pode ser uma máscara que eles vestiram para esconder quem realmente são?
Esse Anime mostra qual é o real significado da frase que você ouviu no começo, que essa tal pessoa perfeita vai sim aparecer em sua vida, porém isso não significa que é alguém sem defeitos, mas que é perfeita para você. Alguém com falhas, defeitos, imperfeições e com dificuldade de retirar a tal máscara, mas que quando enfim estiverem juntos e serem verdadeiros com vocês mesmos, vão brilhar como sempre deveriam.
Então, ao invés de ficar parado e olhando os outros brilharem, que tal retirar essa máscara e ser você mesmo? E quando fizer isso, basta olhar para o lado, pois assim como você, garanto que também verá uma outra joia, pronta para ser polida.

"
                This is going to be a short review after almost 11 years of the show existing. I don't have time and I feel like I have to share how I feel about this show.
Story - 8/10
the story of Toradora follows a scary looking dude and a short but fierce girl on a quest to win love. nothing special, but it sets itself apart from the tropey school romcom bullcrap that we all know by slowly drifting itself into an intense drama with extraordinary character development. story itself was rather average, but I think it's the characters that make the show what it is.
Art- 9/10
very ahead
                  of it's time for a 2008 anime. I very much like the bubbly design with present, but not very intense shading. they look so cute. That's all I can say about the art though. no ecchi or fan-service, just clean, loveable artwork.
Sound- 8/10
I love the voice actor for Taiga. She can pull off fierce and scary, but also cute and sweet at the same time somehow. the opening(s) are catchy as frick. not too keen on the ending songs though. eight out of ten.
Characters-6/10
the characters were a little disappointing. in other words, I f*cking hate Kawashima. Taiga is without question the jewel of the show. but her character is incomplete without Ryuji. Minori is kind of annoying, and I feel that Kitamura is only there for comic relief. Kawashima is just useless, annoying, and selfish. her character is just some second third wheel for both main characters. she does not contribute to the story whatsoever when you think about it. die.
Enjoyment- 10/10
the show is a very sweet, heartwarming experience despite the disappointing characters. it has funny moments, dramatic moments, and it leaves you both complete but still wanting more. the way they progress the characters into people that anyone can like is amazing. and overall It is a very enjoyable show.
Overall- 9/10
overall, Toradora captures the drama and excitement of love, it has very funny and homourist  moments, and is by far my favourate of the romance genre. the sweetest thing you may see. if you haven't watched it, first of all, how? it's been out for 10 years and it's the most enjoyable thing in the  world, second, go freaking watch it. put down your magnum ice cream, close your video of Mia Khalifa, and enjoy the show I promise it's worth your time.",9
"
                I loved this anime.
 It had everything in it! It was sweet and sad, akward and funny. The only think that I didn't like about Toradora was that it didn't make me laugh out loud, but sometimes that ok. Not everything is funny in life. This is the only anime that has made me cry. It will really touch your heart. The ending had alot of meaning and wasnt a cliffhanger like other animes. I loved it so much that I don't want a 2nd season. It is perfect the way it is. If you add something more you might ruin it. This is by
                  far one of the best animes ever! If you are looking for something to make you laugh you a** off and doesn't really have a point, this isn't really the anime for you. But if you are looking for something that will make you smile, cry, and feel warmth in your heart then WATCH TORADORA!!",9
"
                I was kind of apprehensive going into this-- Oh, god, it's another high school girly anime -- but as soon as I started watching Toradora! I fell in love with it. For the most part, the character design is great, I loved the soundtrack, and the voices were spot on. After watching Full Metal Panic! my faith in novel-adapted anime was at an all time low, but Toradora! really changed that. I love the story, and the only thing I can possibly want after watching it is some sort of epilogue. But don't I always?

                This anime series is very funny and is definately one of the must see for the fall 2008 anime season. 
Story: pretty good so far, the love square is very amusing, this school life story is pretty intense to say the least. 
Art: Ok, pretty good, feels definately up to date not like those gonzo crap that looks like its made from the 20th century. 
Sound: the voice fit the character very well. 
Character: good.. so far there isnt any too big twists, so its alright. 
Enjoyment: Great loved it, laughed at it a lot, its almost as good as clannad afterstory.. 
Overall: Definately a
                  must see.. great new school life/romance anime. this definately trumps hyakko, another school life anime in this fall season. If you like romance or school life animes, well you wont be disappointed.",9
"
                This is very different from other love-comedy animes. Its actually very deep and has a lot of symbolism in it. It teaches you a lot of things about your own life and the lives of others. Plus, the scenes are really really cute and you are NEVER bored. I was particularly surprised with how GREAT the art quality is! The characters are also very different and lovable. You know that 'other girl' that distracts the guy a bit from the relationship between him and another which you KNOW is meant to be? yeah, we usually hate that other girl but I don't think you'll find
                  ANYONE who did not like her in this anime. Like I said, ALL the characters are likable and watching it was a great experience. This is a must-must-must-must-must-must watch anime. believe me.",10
"
                Toradora! The anime that has been praised by myself for as long as I can remember has now got me on a post sitting like I'm The Thinker, wondering exactly what made this series, in my mind (at the time), so damn good. You know, it's always great to hype up something if you like it, but when you're sitting in the snow for four hours to go see a concert, and then you come out shit faced because it was ""meh"" really gets me wondering why I was so enthralled with the idea in the first place. That's the feeling I have toward this
                  anime now, exactly wondering where my hype went, and why I was so in love with that one girl in that one high school we don't talk about anymore because life happens.
You know, Toradora isn't bad, in fact I still love it, but I love it a lot less than I initially did. There's a lot going on, and many changes through the characters relationships, but no real bonds that change lives. The real fuel this show has is in the characters. Like them, or hate them, but they're well written and have a nice cohesive bond that sicks, but only for as long as the glue can hold it. While Aisaka may seem like that cliche high school girl who gets her every last desire, she's really trying to find something she has a hard time expressing, and through the expression of anger, she sorta gets what she has been after. And then we have sweet, but albeit, clumsy Minori, who really doesn't know if it's time to talk about UFOs and aliens, or express high school love in a way that sounds old, and much to philosophical ""for her age"" as our dear sweet Ami would say. But she holds her ground, and shows a great deal of expression when the need arises. As for Ami, she may seem like a warm cup-o-noodles but in reality she's a cold, gunned down ship who's definitely ""seen things"" man. Last but not least, we have the main character, Ryuuji, who I can't tell is more obsessed with socks not being put in their correct places, or his future girlfriend, who is definitely not clearly his future girlfriend. He has a sudden stern-ness to his demeanor but just like the tiger, warm and fuzzy on the inside.
All in all you have the characters, I may have missed a few yellowed-haired delinquents, or a few side characters that don't have much of a significant change to the overall deal, but that's Toradora in a nutshell. A crazy show about teenage love and a lot of drama. Did I forget to say, drama?
Anyways I was impressed with the artstyle & animation, specially from what year this anime was made. Both opener songs are great, and catchy, but always leave a sour taste in my mouth that goes away as the show continues. I also have to give it to the dubbed version for being outstandingly accurate to their characters, well done there.
Overall this anime has me thinking if I should get sad that I finished it again, or happy that I got to smile so much. This anime is great, it made me smile a bunch, and laugh a lot. And while it may not be as outstanding as some say, I've made many fond memories with this anime and I'm pretty sure you will too. It's a long and sometimes loud adventure with a very interesting crew of characters to go along with. I highly recommend Toradora!",10
"
                One of the first but still my favourite Anime's to date. The characters are great and it's easy to hop into their life watching this series. It's like mixing Apes with Bunnies into the same cage and watching them adjust into living together and it just happens.
The opening episode was just simply amazing for me. Simple and good slice of life Anime that is easy to watch under your blanket while eating Pizza and crying yourself to sleep. Have I never enjoyed Anime as much as when I was watching this.
I got so into this anime, that I even watched it on one go, it
                  was so good. The characters are very well made and they have been placing extremely well made jokes into the storyline which makes the Anime so good.
I would say if you are an Slice of Life/Romance Anime lover, this is must watch for anyone that likes a good comedy mixed with good romance and a little bit of drama scenes. Personally I will give the Anime a simple 10, but watching from someone's point who has never watched the anime some of the drawings and stuff don't go well together in some parts, so I will drop points from the sound and art.",9
"
                I have one word that describes Toradora! Amazing. 
Even though you could see how this show was going to end from episode 1, just watching it makes you feel... it makes you feel good. 
The voice acting was outstanding, you could feel the emotions of certain characters through the series, but a minute or two later you would start laughing, or just can't help but smile. 
The final episode was perfect, unlike the train wreck ending of clannad after story.
Toradora! is a show that anyone can enjoy. It has the tendency to make you sit at the edge of your at the end of each
                  episode and then push you right back at the beginning of the episode. 
overall? Amazing. but you can say im exaggerating",10
"
                1. Considering the fact that Toradora came out more than 10 years ago, this anime has really good art. 
2. Toradora did really good job on expressing character's emotions and we can see their emotions change through out the whole anime. We can also see characters having inner improvement. Main example is taiga. She no longer acts violently as she did it before. 
3. Many people that this anime was quite boring at the beginning. However, I think this anime showed the daily life of characters which can be quite boring. 
4. Ryuji and Taiga realises that something that they took granted was actually most
                  precious thing. As I mentioned in 3, this anime makes audiences to think as the way how those characters think. and I think Toradora did really good job on that.",10

Honestly speaking, Toradora! is one of the anime that I've heard good things about but when I looked at the poster art and synopsis, it didn't seemed that interesting to me. That's how I usually judge what I want to watch. Fortunately, this anime is a good example of 'Don't judge a book (or anime) by its cover'. Splashes of surprises greeted me as I dived right into the anime.
The biggest thing about Toradora! is that it didn't felt cliché at all despite the premise of the story. Basically, a scary-looking guy and a short,
                  tsundere girl formed a sudden alliance in order to get closer to their respective crushes. While this ticks all the things needed for an unoriginal high-school love setting, Toradora! steered away and became its own special anime. This hugely comes down to the depth given to the characters. Firstly, their interactions between each other gives way to amusing and awkward situations. Yes, the majority of the comedy are running gags that became quite dry halfway but the anime are punctuated by a handful of unique and well-made ones. Another great factor was that each character were believable and for the most part, realistic. This creates drama in the form of complicated love relationships, which in turn focuses on psychological features such as guilt, jealousy and ignorance. It goes to show how complex the human mind can be when dealing with powerful emotions such as love. While it's a risk, it's definitely a risk worth taking by Toradora! to convey this theme in a neat way. And because the characters are relatable, I find myself reacting and feeling the same way they do in a lot of scenes, both sad from the drama and happy from the comedy.
Expressing the characters is important and the anime portrayed this strongly through its art and animation. Whether it's blushing from embarrassment, pouring out tears or the sudden surge of anger, J.C. Staff did it right. By no means do I find the art style to be anything out of this world but I liked the cute, simplistic nature of it. Exaggerated movements made the comedy funnier, along with the creative visual approach from some it too. The voice-acting did a quality job for the expressiveness of the characters. They carried feelings whenever they speak, particularly in parts where the psychology I've mentioned are involved. A couple of soundtracks also stood out. Some was so well-placed that I wasn't expecting to suddenly be bombarded by a wave of feels but nonetheless, it happened and that was good production.
Toradora! is the essence of what a great anime looked like following a common plot concept, love in high school. What separated it from others is the fact that it delved and explored the psychological effects of this emotion we called love. The character's realism and comedic interactions takes you in for a ride through their high school life as they developed and changed.",8

                If you love romantic comedy, you'll love this. The reason why I can't give it a higher score is because of the very sudden turn of events at the last ep. It totally ruined the show. Well, that's my opinion. I think the ending was very stupid. They could have atleast think fo something more creative than that. (i wouldnt explain more--it will just be a spoiler)
I didnt hate the show...I LOVED it..BUT NOT THE ENDING.

                EVERYTIME! It;s my go to on rewatches, nothing really compares. The pacing and everything is perfect. and like, from the start we know the two MCs are gonna get together, but it really keeps you guessing and does such a good job of doing it. I always find the romantic connection in this genre can seem so forced but Toradora does it in such a natural but tropey way it's perfect. It's such a fun series I can watch any random episode and just watch and love it, no matter which episode because even the comedy on it's own is solid. You can litterally watch
                  episode 20 and have a good idea of what's going on and get a laugh even on it's own. I say episode 20 but any episode of toradora stands on its down. We know who the two MCs are, we know they end up together and the greatness about it is seeing them get to the point. From the moment Taiga says (SPOILER, altho Im sure everyone here as watched)
that male MC is hers at the pool, your heart just melts and you know you're in for a treat, they truly did such a great job , Now I've never read the manga but I'm sure it's just as great if not better. I love the tropes and everything about this series. I love the tsundere main girl. I love the super beautiful but actually mean and evil girl, the energetic athletic girl, the geeky but actually actually attractive to all the other girls best friend and our main character, Who is actually quite unique to this genre besides doing anything and everything the main girl asks which is tropey and cringe normally but They make it work here because of the plot and how it is wrtten, Toradora to me is easily my favourite anime I have watched. I came into it as a Shonen or Seinen fan, I never thought a little 24 episode romance anime would be my favourite anime ever until I watched this anime, The emotion and character interaction is so great and natural, and that says a lot considering I watched it dubbed. I love all the goods and bads with this anime. I love all the dynamics between the characters. I love toradora and will rewatch it atleast twice a year, it truly brings back those memories of highschool and has that simple yet explosive feel to it. Like back in highschool where even the more trivial thing would be such a huge thing for you experienceing it. Toradora captures that perfectly. It doens't over sexualize the female or male characters, yet puts them in a spot light where you can appreciate the artists choices for how they look. Taiga isnt draw or animated as this incredibly attractive loli, She' almost has a natural look about her that I love. And the other two girls Ami and Minori. They may have the unnatural anime hair colour but they are drawn in a way where I know who they are exactly. Ami is drawn to seem more of the picture of beauty and a clear model where as Minori is drawn to seem like that athletic fun loving social girl you may of had a crush on starting in middle school and carry into highschool, and the plot portrays that perfectly. That;s exactly Ryujis relationship and feelings, and I think most guys in middle school had a crush on that exact girl, but as our main male protag grows up and lives a life with taiga where he grows and bonds with her he begins to realize that he truly cares for her and wants to see her succeed in life, which is fundamental to a succesful relationship I feel is help someone reach their goals which eventually they do. Him learning the true nature of how she is with her parents is such a huge thing and send a message to teenagers and young adults watching this anime or reading the manga. I loved everything about it. Things arent always what they seem, and sometimes trying to help ends up making things worse. Sometimes what you want wont work for someone else, and sometimes what works for you wont work for your friend/partner. Yet they move past that. Ryuji admits where he was wrong and the two move past that, eventually becoming a couple in one of the best and most dramatic ways possible. Now people might say the whole running away together thing was out of nowhere and drastic but I feel it was perfectly set up. anyway, end of the day. Anime was amazing, easily my favourite of over 100 series watched, and I'm glad I took the time to watch it. It's one of those animes you wish you could remove from your memory and rewatch again and that's a testament to how good it is. Toradora! is Number fucking ONE BAYBAY!
Even right down to the first OP, where you know exactly what kinda character you are gonna deal with and learn to love. Simply put, Toradora! is a 11/10 at least, a perfect Romcom/slice of life story that builds perfectly and leaves you wanting more, but not so much that the actual anime left you starved, you got a full course meal, they teased Taiga and Ryuji getting together and then they actualy do and so many animes DONT do that, they either never do, or the MC goes for a character he has no romantic relationship with, But the build in Toradora! is amazing and to me the best part about it, she start with punching him in the face, and by the final episode (The OVA) they kiss in the classroom and we've already seen them do so but That final kiss when she comes back to see him in the very room she left the love note for Yusaku means so much. Toradora is amazing, it's well written, and it warms your heart. I said earlier in this review I went into it as a shonen, seinen, action isekai kinda viewer. I went into it with my favourite series probably being Full Metal or maybe Parasyte. But I left with Toradora being the best anime I have ever watched, and it opened my eyes and heart to a whole new genre. A genre I now love. I didnt even know about Angel Beats before this, but I gotta say I've watched so many animes simiilar , that slice of life, romance, action, highschool genre because of toradora and it stil stands out on top. So many great series I watched. Toradora beat out Gurrenn Lagann, an easy 10/10. Kamina died for this, Kamina died for Toradora, for me to watch one of the most heart wrenching, funny, heart BREAKING, and real romcom/slice of life animes out there. I STRONGLY recommend toradora to any experience or Fresh anime viewer, it will not disappoint. If you're looking for a great story, great characters and great writing, and a plit that MAKES SENSE, TORADORA! is for you. Please watch, I implore you.
Toradora is the perfect coming of age story, where we follow Ryuhi finding out the person he loves in the person that needs him, and that he needs. Ryuji is in need to Be needed and at the start we see that, He craves it with his mother and wants people to truly know who he is, and Taiga is the first one to let herself into his life. Which makes sense why they eventually fall for eachother, but as I stated earlier, He fell for Minori years before as she was that outgoing athletic girl that most guys had a crush on at that time, and because he was shunned because of his looks he was never able to meet anyone else or move past that crush, eventually obsessing over it. That's not to say him and Minori didn't have a clear connection and were good together, but I feel about of the three girls she ended up being the weakest option and the least he connected with, which is what I love about the series. He honestly connects with Ami better than either girl. But him and Taigas relationship is so special I truly enjoyed watching every minute of it. Also they didn't do some Harem bullcrap, there was none of that bullshit. It was a few girls that genuinely liked Ryuji . Minori didn't like him at first, Ami liked him Because of how he treated her differently I felt, and Taiga loved him because of how he cared for her and he was the only one that seen her as a person that needed to be helped where as everyone else seen her as a mean little monster. 
I need to stop writing this as I'm turning this into a damn novel and I KNOW none of you are going to read this far ahead. Regardless. TORADORA! is the best and most fun and heart warming anime I've watched in awhile. Please do watch, It's just my opinion but I loved it!",10
"
                I hate this, it doesn't deserved to be in comparison with Fruits Basket or any other romance anime. Literally the characters are insufferable, especially Taiga, she is so bratty and ungrateful, on top of having an overall aggressive attitude. The main guy (who's name is not memorable) has no backbone and literally his personality revolves around serving Taiga. The blue haired girl was the best character, and I still don't even like her. All their friends were not memorable and did not have a big role in my opinion, which made the anime suck. Like I really feel like life would be better if I
                  didn't watch this anime, I was told that it gets better, it doesn't, I can't believe I actually watched this. Please, don't. 
But at least the animations were good! BUT THE OPENING SONG OMG THAT'S THE WORSE PART.",1

                ____________________________________
(MAY CONTAIN SMALL SPOILERS)
Toradora! is (IMO) one of the few rom/coms that has very little flaws with a lot of things done right. I have seen a lot of the rom/coms out there and Toradora! instantly became my favorite show and still is. 
Story - 9
I really liked the idea of a romance that where neither of the main characters started out liking eachother. Instead, you get to see both of the main characters (Taiga,Ryuuji) grow over the episodes and see how there relationship changes from just a simple goal at the start to them having to come to understand the feelings they have for
                  eachother. I found no experiences of cliche moments that you see happen over and over again in rom/coms. No forced comedy and not many flaws overall. No really forced humor which is a BIG plus. 
Art - 9
The animation and overall smoothness of the show is good throughout.  I love how in some moments the animation really shines i think near the ending/climax of the show and it fits the scenes perfectly for whats happening. 
Sound - 8
The sound fits the type of show Toradora! is. Its mostly a bunch of acoustic guitar and strings in the background music; but it has its moments where the soundtrack really does its job (""Lost my pieces"") on the emotional conflicts and aspects of it. 
Characters - 10
The characters is why I have this as my favorite show and is the driving force behind what makes the show really worth it. Each characters like in other shows has their own set of quirks that make them unique, but Toradora! DOESN'T fall into the typical rom/com style with not having much depth and reason like most do. The most enjoyable part of the show is how each characters relationship is with each other and how they try to understand their own feelings with who and want they want. 
My waifu is best 
Yours is shit
Tsunderes ftw ☆*:.｡.o(≧▽≦)o.｡.:*☆
Enjoyment/Overall - 10
I very much enjoyed this show and will forever be (probably) my favorite show ever. I say its not for everyone especially if you cant stand tsunderes then you might find it hard since the show relies a lot on Taiga's character/personality. Besides that this is a perfect show for someone who loves romance/drama/comedy or looking for a first show to dip your feet into the genre. I was really satisfied with the ending and have rewatched the entire show 7 times. 
Hope it was helpful",10
"
                It's not your typical high school comedy/romance anime. It's worth the watch but I can't say it's fantastic. Story line goes a bit slow at times, but the interesting characters keep your attention. Character design was good, one thing I especially appreciated was how they designed the male lead, he doesn't look like your typical anime romeo, they designed him to look like 'one of the bad guys' which I thought was really refreshing and new with all the staples in anime design it's nice to see someone step outside the box every now and again.

                Now, first of all, let me just say that I don`t usually watch these types of anime. I tend to stay away from the romantic-comedy-slice-of-life type of shows, because they are for the most part incredibly predictable and just flat out boring. So when my friend suggested me to check out Toradora, I was expecting it to be yet another run-of-the-mill romcom. But oh boy, how wrong I was. Toradora turned out to be an absolute masterpiece, and probably one of my favorite animes.
Now, things start out slow in this anime. For the first couple of episodes, I wasn`t really  into it, and I
                  was just looking to finish the darn thing as fast as possible (I had promised my friend I would watch the whole thing). But despite having this negative attitude, I couldn`t stop watching it. For some reason, I kept clicking the ""next episode"" button over and over again. After episode 5 or 6, I was completely hooked. It took me two days to finish all of the 25 episodes, and oh man, what a f*cking ride.
You see, the bread and butter of Toradora is the characters. They are masterfully written and acted out, designed to work off of eachother. Every character has a different personality, and instead of only falling in love with one character (like I usually do), I found myself caring about each and every one of them, interested to see what they would do next. The humor in the show is actually funny, and it`s a joy to see how all of the characters interact with eachother. Toradora is, in a nutshell, all about the characters, and how their personalities develop over a long amount of time.
The story is sadly somewhat predictable, and I knew how it was going to end by basically just looking at the cover art for the show. But after watching about 10 or 11 episodes, I started to realize that even though I knew how it was going to end, I had no idea HOW the characters would eventually reach that ""position"", so to speak. I had no idea how the story would pan out and eventually reach that satisfying conclusion that everyone here on MAL agrees is probably one of the best endings ever. And let me tell you right now, the ending is absolutely perfect, and makes it all worth it. It really feels like you have gone on a journey with these characters, seen them grow over time and eventually reach that amazing conclusion.
The show is also supported by what must be some of the most incredible soundtracks and beautiful background music I have ever heard. Some of the saddest scenes in this show (which would have been incredibly sad even without the music) is made even sadder by a beautiful piano soundtrack that literally makes me tear up every time I hear it. During some of the scenes in this show, I had to blink away the tears from my eyes. Only a select few animes has ever managed to make me tear up before, but this show just did it for me.
Toradora is one of those shows that grows on you over time, and I promise you that if you have the patience to watch a show with a slow pace and steady character development, you will end up absolutely loving it. I cannot recommend this anime enough, and I would suggest that you drop everything you are currently doing, sit down, and start watching this show. By the time you reach that satisfying ending, you will be probably be completely absorbed by Toradora`s world and characters, and it will be in your head days after you finished it.
This show is an absolute masterpiece, and that`s why my final rating for Toradora is a 10/10.",10
"
                At first, it seems like it's a quirky show about nothing--about people doing everyday things. But as you keep watching, you see that it has a story to tell—one I found quite meaningful and worthwhile—and it tells it quite beautifully. Perhaps one of the best, most realistic depictions of the subtleties of human emotions and relationships that I've seen.
The main characters are interesting, distinct, and each is given an opportunity to convey who they are and the role they play.
The show has no filler—if anything, you want more of it! Though the ending ties things up nicely, and I would say is a happy ending
                  that was realistic and made sense for the story.
Is it an uplifting show? Not really. But it's not depressing or filled with gore or violence, either. It doesn't take you on a constant emotional roller coaster, though it certainly has a lot of emotional depth, and another rare quality: heart. It's subtle, but it's there.
And it's kind of nice to watch something that takes itself seriously (but not too much) but isn't about saving the world or fighting some big arch-nemesis. It's not a big epic story, but rather something about everyday life--something more intimate and personal. I found that compelling, refreshing, and more enjoyable than I expected I would. You may find that, too.",10
"
                Toradora is one of those shows where you can see all the building blocks and components of its narrative, yet they never quite come together. A rare problem for a romance/comedy anime, this show has all the logical character elements to justify why the plot plays out the way it does but lacks the emotional binding to make it resonate, or sometimes even convince the viewer to suspend their disbelief. Very much the opposite issue most Rom-Coms have, which mostly favour emotional compulsion over making some semblance of sense. The show mechanically hints at deeper character elements in our cast that could or should logically
                  exist but never emotionally sells it. Due to the dissonance between its dramatic elements and the style of comedy it is going for, Toradora ends up feeling unnatural or even engineered. 
Unlike some other Rom-Coms, Toradora's main source of humour comes from its physicality instead of its character per se. While there is tension and chemistry between them, comedy is seldom derived from snappy dialogue or even social circumstances. A lot of its humour is distinctly absurdist and slapstick even when the physical element is absent. While this comedic style has its advantages, and is perhaps uniquely suited to animation where there is a higher threshold for physical exaggeration, Toradora dials it up beyond eleven. The fights often seem like something better suited to an action anime, albeit quite a subdued one, with the amount of exaggerated movement and violence. Jumping from table to table with a wooden sword, running on top of a crowd of people, knocking multiple people out with a single baseball slug, it all goes beyond heightened reality to straight-up cartoonish. Again, this is not necessarily a problem. That is, until the rest of the show establishes the tone of a completely regular high school environment. While colourful characters and larger than life personalities are to be expected, the boundaries of Toradora's world are implicitly set to be similar to our own. What people can get away with is implied to be in their mannerisms and appearance, less so physical actions. This establishes the root of Toradora's problems, an inherent difficulty to sell suspension of disbelief that spills into a tonal dissonance.
None of these over the top physical elements are ever acknowledged to be absurd, nor are they treated as comically unremarkable. They constantly fall into this middle ground where the background or supporting cast finds the violence exceptional but nothing to be genuinely shocked about.  In contrast, most other anime would either abstract extreme physical actions to an even more cartoonish style or tone down the exaggeration entirely so that it could conceivably fit in with the rest of the animation. Toradora comes off as having exaggerated physicality done solely for the viewer's benefit but never addressed by the characters themselves. The violence is funny because the viewer knows how absurd it is, yet this feels like it is constantly breaking the fourth wall since there is little explanation for the cast can accept something like this in a supposedly grounded setting. It is not as if we see an exaggerated perception of one of the characters or a delusion. The reaction of the background and supporting cast constantly indicate they are viewing the same insane physical actions as us. Yet it is never wholly ignored or passed off as expected for a dash of absurdist humour, nor is it ever addressed how a supposedly mundane setting can tolerate this behaviour. It is also not helped because none of the violence is absurd enough to be treated as implicitly unbelievable. This dissonance constantly erodes the suspension of disbelief as the series progresses, to the point where it's hard to become invested in anything dramatic since it feels distinctly artificial. 
This has the knock-on effect of making any issues with the characters more glaring. With not only the physicality of the characters but their personalities also exaggerated, it is hard to feel they are in any way real without some serious suspension of disbelief. Again, none of this is necessarily an issue since there are plenty of comedies that do both. However, most of those are solely comedies where the audience does not need to or is never under the illusion that things are anywhere close to real life. In a sense, the characters are meant to be caricatures or extreme exaggerations for comedic effect instead of for dramatic effect. Where Toradora starts to falter is when it wants to be part drama as well. There is the inkling of this in its earlier episodes where it very blatantly hints that there is more to the characters than how they appear on the surface. Taiga and Ryuji have less than ideal or extremely unconventional families respectively, Kushieda is rather hamfistedly shown to be using her airheaded optimism to be compensating for something else, etc. In fact, Kawashima is probably the only character with some semblance of 'normalcy' relative to our protagonists. The problem is that drama requires both an attachment to characters to find compelling and suspension of disbelief. 
What this all boils down to is that the dramatic exaggeration and comedic exaggeration never gel together. This is due primarily to the viewer never being sure if they are supposed to empathise with the characters' plight as dramatised versions of real people or laugh because they are absurdist representations of tropes. While an excellent show could conceivably strike a balance or meld the two together, it is usually achieved through some grounding. And that grounded element usually is in its physicality. For instance, Kaguya-sama Love is War keeps its physical interactions within the realm of reason which preserves the suspension of disbelief. Its exaggerated elements are in the mannerisms and personalities of the characters, which are both also pointed out by the supporting cast to be quite insane. On the other hand, a show like I'm Sakamoto or Gintama embrace their absurdity and forgo almost all serious dramatic elements. Even The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya keeps its physicality in check for most episodes, although they can explain a lot of it away with their supernatural elements. This leaves Toradora in a no man's land where it is hard to become attached to any of the characters since it is their unbelievable nature in every way is that is supposed to drive the comedy but also be dramatic. 
By extension, all the hinting of a deeper level of characterisation feels more mechanical than anything. In particular, Kushineda's real insecurities are never explained nor developed. This could be seen as subtlety, in that the audience does not necessarily need to know explicitly what she is insecure about. The revelations about her real personality remain a logical conclusion but both also emotionally unsatisfying and unfounded.  While this subtlety might work for a drama, it does not do Toradora any favours. The result of this is that all the character developments feel entirely explicable but completely mechanical. In particular, the ending makes a lot more sense through this lens. Taiga and Ryuji are deeply eccentric and predisposed to extreme behaviour because of their less than conventional and unstable upbringing. Yet, none of this is emotionally sold to the viewer. For anyone that processes things emotionally, this would blindside them or, at best, be melodrama.  Anyone looking at this development logically would eventually see the building blocks there to support it but feel it is distinctly inorganic to the narrative. In fact, Taiga and Ryuji's whole relationship could be summed up in this manner. 
The show actually sells a strong, almost sibling-like friendship between the two very well. If there was any romantic tension, it is built incredibly poorly and relies on the viewer's prejudice; that the audience would equate two people being exceedingly close as automatically romantic or inevitably leading towards it. Love is complicated, and this narrative of close friends discovering romantic feelings for each other is worth exploring. Yet here it feels, again, distinctly mechanical. The chemistry established between the two of them hardly appears romantic most of the time. In a single episode early on, Toradora actually develops more romantic tension between Ryuji and Kawashima than it ever does with Taiga. This lack of visceral desire between the two of them or any acknowledgement of deeper feelings, even internally, leave the viewer realising that it all seems forced. Like most of its more profound character elements, it all feels emotionally forced or unnatural despite the logical foundations being there. Interestingly, this is the opposite problem most Rom-Coms face since they often have a much stronger emotional narrative that tends to make little logical sense.
Overall, Toradora is competently done and planned out. But that is hardly enough to be considered good, especially in a genre so heavily reliant on its characters. The strange position this show is in, having characters that 'make sense' yet lacking the emotional punch, makes it hard to rate. It is difficult to say it is terrible, especially since most of the time, Rom-Coms fail due to completely nonsensical plots. Yet, Toradora cannot be called good all because it dodges one major issue since it replaces it with another less conventional one. Objectively, this show is probably a 5 out of 10. It is a good blueprint for what a standard Rom-Com should be attempting to execute. But it has too many issues to warrant anything higher. Personally, I failed to get attached to any characters the moment I realised how engineered all their arcs were. As if you could see it planned out on a piece of paper. There were some funny moments but none that really captured anything special. The finale was simply a jumping the shark moment in an attempt to achieve both romantic drama and comedy but largely failing at both. Whether the groundwork was present is largely irrelevant by that point since either investment in the narrative is lost, or the viewer has completely eaten up the tropes the characters represent.",5

                What can I say....the only times I write reviews are when I discover a masterpiece, now you knw why I'm here.
Toradora, the sound is great...the violin and the piano really correlate with the level of emotion in the anime itself, the story is good....but not so close to a masterpiece as something such as YOUR LIE IN PARIL ( which is also a great anime ) Although the characters....ooooooohhhh mmmmmyyy gooossshhhhh the main heroine, the tsundre, one of the most beloved ones of all time infact is my favourite character to date.

                Finished this anime is under 2 days and what more can I say other than it was quite brilliant. 
I watched it with a friend who very rarely watches anime, let alone likes one a lot, and now all they can do is re-watch their favourite scenes.
I think this anime would appeal to a lot of people, or atleast I'd recommend it to anyone.
The story is interesting, however it seems to develop very quickly. 
I love the personalities of all the characters though, each has their own little weird quirks that just get more interesting throughout the episodes and their voices and some of the
                  sounds that come from them are ...hilarious.

                  try to help eachother win the hearts of their friends, all building up to romantic drama and a satisfyingly melodramatic conclusion.
The art and animation are what I'd consider on par for the time. The biggest and most impressive bits of animation are saved for the latter half of the series when the drama pops off. Character designs are interesting and varied.
I liked both the subbed version and the dubbed version of Toradora! and think each adds its own flavor to the series. I'd watch one and then the other on a rewatch. Performances are really good on both ends but I feel the dub catches a lot more emotion during the climax.
Characters are all interesting and have their quirks.
Ryuuji is a master of housework and loves to cook and clean.
Taiga fails at simple tasks and is clumsy despite her attitude.
The side characters all play major roles in the plot and it gives them more depth, showing how quickly a character's personality can change once their perception of another changes. They all stay consistent within their respective developments throughout the story.
I really enjoyed Toradora! The drama knows when to pick up so that the story doesn't stagnate or slow down too much. The focus is never shifted too far from the protagonists but their interactions with the side characters are well written and makes them more believable. I think Toradora! is a good, quirky, and dramatic romance story that can be easily accessible to anyone.",8
"
                If there's anything I hate most in film, it's second hand embarrassment. If I see the characters of a show fucking up and making a fool of themselves, I sometimes literally have to turn it off and walk away, sometimes never finishing it if it's bad enough. Unfortunately, the more and more I watch these slice of life /romance animes, the more and more I'm cringing out of my skin. Why can't I have a fun romance story where the characters don't totally fuck up and make fools out of themselves in public? Seriously! I could hardly watch Your Lie In April despite loving classical
                  music because the main characters literally fucked up in front of huge audiences OVER AND OVER. It's the same with Toradora, unfortunately.
The first few episodes went great. I was really looking forward to this. Then it started down the slippery slope of drama and embarrassment. Taiga became someone who literally could barely function around others, as well as basically devolving into a small child. Swimming with floaties in front of a crowd? Starting love drama in front a crowd? Fucking up a wrestling act in front of a crowd? What the fuck? This doesn't fucking contribute to the story at all. 
It pains me greatly to say it, but this anime is yet another emotionally exhausting romance anime, and 12 episodes in, there's almost no romance at all. When I get to the point that I dread watching the next episode because I know it'll be embarrassing as fuck, I know it's time to stop watching.
However, my viewpoint is probably very uncommon, and ignoring the cringe, this show is very good. Thus, the 8/10 rating. If you don't agree with my points, you'll love this anime.",8
"
                - No Spoilers -
I LOVE this show. I've watched it three times now and plan to watch it a bunch more. 
Toradora might be a glorified romcom, but something about this show makes it infinitely more lovable to me than all the other slice of life / romance anime's I've seen. The soundtrack is great, the characters are memorable (I actually remembered the side characters' names!), and plot doesn't drag on like most 25 episode anime's do. 
But more importantly...
This show feels like a love letter to high-school. I haven't even graduated and this show makes me miss high-school; isn't that funny? That weird nostalgia
                  will probably only get worse after I graduate in a few months. Toradora doesn't hide the bad parts of high-school, like the rampant melodrama and dysfunctional social dynamics. Rather, it unapologetically embraces them. Toradora manages to show ALL aspects of high-school, good and bad, and still leave me with a newfound appreciation for high-school in one way or another. I really like that.
Looking back on it, I don't think I've gotten the same high-school experience everyone in Toradora did. In fact, I think most people haven't. Especially with those like myself currently doing school from home because of the pandemic. But who says we have to? Toradora highlights the beauty of high-school and growing up in general. Any media that makes me look back on growing up with love is good in my books.
Thanks Toradora <3",10
"
                Toradora! was one of the Best anime's I have ever seen.
The story was simple yet touching and showed many scrambled emotions in the story and was totally unpredictable. The characters showed their emotions very well and the story makes you ""scramble and fit all the puzzle pieces together"". The songs were very catchy and made a huge dramatic impact on the scenes. 
The character's personalities was amazing. Their hid their love very well and everything was very touching. It just makes you want to cry when it's sad, laugh when it's funny and everything ! !
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It may sound like a
                  simple love story but it's more then that.",10
"
                Oh boy, isn't this anime the best romantic comedy I've ever watched? Take it from me: a not so keen on romcom anime fan - Toradora has the best character development I've ever seen in months.
It all starts with a simple yet kinda confusing premise, introduced by the two main characters - Ryuuji and Taiga - they meet each other in an extremely odd situation: both of them have crushes on one of their classmates. From that: each one has the other one's crush as a friend - ALLIANCE MATERIAL DISCOVERED, PROCEED TO HELP ONE ANOTHER.
Let me say, the characters in this show start rather
                  cliché and one-sided - until episode 5 (which is when you'll see the first appearance of the 5th and last protagonist - Ami), it's safe to say all the characters don't surpass their initial personality characteristics: the tsundere, the overly nice and energetic girl, the extremely responsible and nice vice-president from the School's Students Council... And on and on...
You reach episode five and you'll notice the characters are somewhat evolving in their own unique way - the writers made a good job on the character development, because all the characters surpass their initial, cliché personality traits; in my opinion, all the protagonists become some of the best and undeniably memorable characters in the romantic genre.
It's one hell of a ride, and Toradora never misses to keep you waiting until it unveils its most dramatic moments - which are really heart-wrenching and, for me (a real sucker for good drama), jaw-dropping. 
At its core, Toradora can offer good characters, good individual development, great drama and heartbreaking moments.
Let's proceed to the technical part of this review now.
Can I just say how freaking horrible is the first opening? I mean, not the animation or overall concept - but the song. I'm sorry, I didn't enjoy it, not in the slightest. It's kind of annoying and I do not think it fits the tone of the show, but that's just my opinion. I'm damned to have the annoying beat of the song in my head for the next two weeks at least. 
The second opening is an improvement - but I skipped it after I heard a part of it. I have to say I did enjoy some of the background pieces: they were good!
The animation is good and decent, specially for this genre of anime. However, some of the dramatic moments and possibly awesome scenes were ruined by a rushed animation. It's completely noticeable that the animators wanted to make it soft, fluid and enjoyable, but it seemed rushed and unintelligible. Maybe I just have a bad eye sight, but I did not enjoy it much.
Enjoyment? I really liked it - more than I expected to!

Story 10 / 10
Toradora!'s story is an interesting one. Although it is a romance anime, it completely disregards the regular protocol of what a romance anime should be. Characters seem to have their own will more than ever, disregarding the plot line completely, if necessary, to achieve their own personal goals. Characters exist solely for themselves in this anime. What I mean by this is that in a normal romance anime, characters take certain steps in life towards the same goal: to eventually get a guy and a girl together. These steps seem often forced or unnatural, since it doesn't take the minor characters
                  feelings and dreams into consideration. They are just there to eventually get the two main characters together.
This, however, is not the case in Toradora!. This anime makes sure to highlight multiple characters to show off their dreams, desires and thoughts, and makes them take steps in life to get what they want. Even though there are in fact two main characters, there will be no guarantee if they end up together or not. These independent characters make Toradora!'s story a lot better than any other romance anime.
Toradora! itself is very entertaining. Don't think you will have figured out the plot by just watching a couple of episodes. So much will happen in Toradora! that you will start to doubt who will end up with whom. And sometimes you'll even start wondering if anyone is going to end up together.
The comedy of Toradora! is really good as well. Again, if it wasn't for the characters, this anime wouldn't be as good as it is. The interaction between characters is very well written, which makes for tons of funny scenes which will make you laugh out loud.
The story is very well written and incredibly entertaining. It made me watch episode after episode non-stop. For that reason, I give Toradora! a 10 out of 10 concerning the story.
Characters 10 / 10
As you can already guess: the characters deserve a 10 out of 10! All characters, even the ones that make minor appearences, are incredibly well written. All characters, even the minor ones, are witty and relatable. They are easy to sympathize with and act very independant, yet care a lot for each other. In the final episodes of Toradora!, you will know, and love, a vast cast of characters, who form a strong bond.
Art 9 / 10
I really like Toradora!'s art. It's not a 10, but the art suits the anime very well. For that reason the art deserves a 9 out of 10
Sound 10 / 10
I love the OST as well as all the opening themes and ending themes of Toradora!. The music during dramatic as well as romantic scenes fits these scenes really well. It is because of the music certain scenes will have a big impact on you.
Enjoyment 10 / 10
I enjoyed Toradora! from episode 1 to the final epsiode! Toradora! truly is a masterpiece and the best romance anime I have ever seen.
Overall 10 / 10
Toradora! definately deserves a 10 out of 10. This anime needs its characters to carry the story, as most romance and drama anime do. Luckily, Toradora!'s characters are amazing! One of the best casts I have ever seen might I add. All characters are interesting, witty and easy to relate to. They interact very nicely with each other and form a strong bond.
The art is really good and the music is outstanding!
Overall I have enjoyed Toradora! more than I could have imagined before starting this wonderful anime. I recommend Toradora! to everyone, even to people who are new to the romance genre, or dislike the romance genre. Since Toradora! has no traditional romance story, I know that even people who dislike the romance genre will like this one.
Thank you for listening!

                I'm sure there are some people still who really enjoy this anime, and it might even be for you, but if you want something different from the dime a dozen RomCom anime that you've seen before, you're in the wrong place.
Basically I very much enjoyed this anime, until I got near the end.  From everything that I could see it was setup to be wonderful.  I liked the different characters, it had a good sense of comedy, it was very upbeat and just gave an overall good impression.  However, pretty early into it I started to fear that it would end up
                  as so many other shows in the Romance/Comedy genre do.
Now, to be fair, the ending is pretty much what I expected from the beginning.  What ended up really annoying me was that throughout the story it was written for there to be something unique and different about this anime.  Something that I wouldn't have called right off the bat from the VERY FIRST EPISODE.  I began to be excited about the prospects of seeing something that very few authors dare to do for some reason.  But in the end it was all for naught.  The author kind of seemed to say ""screw that"" and forcibly shoved the story back into what I originally thought it would be.  It seemed like everything that had been done and built up was solely for the purpose of adding boat loads of drama.  The interesting character interactions, the different possibilities, all severed.  Akin to cutting off your right arm when it's perfectly healthy.
It hurt me...a lot...
TL;DR
The story was written such that it could have been different from every other anime in it's genre while still being good and rewarding, then at the last second decided to be predictable and annoying.  It gave me a dramatic finish, when all I wanted was a happy one.",4
"
                For me, this anime was an amazing entertainment. If you enjoy comedy and romance then this is definitely the type for you!. On the first episode, you straight away get to see what type of characters the main one's are like, Taiga and Ryuuji. The disappointing thing, is that I thought there relationship would develop more faster into a ""love"" type of relationship. An excellent refreshing type of anime non the less! . The other thing I want to mention is the soundtrack, its very peaceful for the special moments in this anime that just fit so perfectly. And a nice high quality animation, I
                  especially loved the effect with Taiga on the first episode. 
The characters of Taiga and Ryuuji, are both quite similar. They're both the most aggressive people in school, which the students are most afraid of. So they tend to stay away from then, kind of like an outcast however both the characters do have friends. The backstory's of these characters are not taken that much into detail, however they get you to think more differently on both the characters. Both of these characters are the tsundere types, which is why I think took them both so long to figure out their feelings. However their relationship begins to blossom right from the first episode. Then you have the other main characters, Ami, Minori and Kitamura. Minori being the friend of Taiga's and Kitamura is the friend of Ryuuji's. And then you have Ami, who happens to be a popular model who everyone in the school admires. 
Minori, starts off as a very energetic and cheerful character who can always put a smile on your face. But as things start to build up, we see her moods start to change in a little, in a sort of depressing way which turns into very strong emotions between her and Taiga, Ryuuji and Ami. Minori is also a character who you just...cant hate as she is such an amazing fun character who mainly likes to focus on making her friends happy. 
Ami, well, we see her a two-faced character. One side she is nice and what seems to be the perfect person, and on the other side, she has a himedere type of personality. She turns into a mean character who doesn't seem to care about anyone around her. She first makes this impression on Taiga in a coffee shop. Ami is well known for her good looks and charm in this show, and through each episode we get to see her other personality slowly come out, and get more serious in life. 
Kitamura is pretty much an average guy who goes about his day, however he does play an important role in this show by figuring out what's right for his friends around him. Until one day he just brakes and goes a little crazy for a bit, and eventually go back to his normal self. We get to see him express many emotions and feelings which you would not really think he had. He always seemed to be in one type of mood until that heart-warming episode came along. He doesn't have much of a back story but a good character, only slightly boring. 
So, a lot of times you will be finding yourself wondering how long will it be until someone finally confesses to someone. I have to admit is was rather frustrating, however I knew something good was going to happen, and that's one of main things that can really keep you watching this anime. An absolutely amazing entertainment!",10
"
                This show is cliche, and became poor when the second half started. Strong start at the beginning. The characters are very good, but it can't decide what love interest is suited for the main character. So much implications from one girl yet it never goes nowhere with her. and the main character. I got annoyed, and I dropped the show after my satisfaction wasn't met. You will met one girl who changes her faults, and improves her character. She even tells her secrets to the main character. The main character is oblivious to her. I don't understand this decision to make her change for the
                  better, and start flirting with the main character. Then all this is toss aside never touched upon again. The main character just friend zones her, and go for the other girl. The anime writer can't stick to one direction. Overall 3/10 Check the manga instead since it's a different writer, and the original writer.",3
"
                Toradora Toradora Toradora this show became my favorite anime a while back why you may ask well lets get started Toradora seems like some casual love circle anime but i say Neih because right as soon as you get to the second half of the show you have transcended this show made me so god damn emotional. 
the characters in this show are made wonderful you feel like you really have a connection with them and once you reach the second half of the show my god it gets so good the OP the visuals and just everything. i believe i get so emotional from
                  this show is because i can relate to a bunch of situations these character are dealing with even if you dont its worth your while so please watch what is known to be one of the best romance animes of all time Thank you for your time",10
"
                Well this is going to be my first review to be honest and the reason being that this was the show that kick started my love for anime again and the romance/slice of life genre. 
Toradora has an excellent collection of characters which all interweave through a lovely and well paced story that will bring happiness, sadness and tension between them. 
The show itself is beautifully animated and the voice work is brilliant in particular scenes where it needed to deliver. I have watched many romance animes and slice of life and I still think this is one of the best ones to show off
                  the genre. 
A lot of people are put off mainly due to Taiga (Lead female) being angry, violent and annoying. But if you bare through it she because such a well rounded and more respected person by the shows end. 
I can't really say much else but that this show is fantastic.",9
"
                This anime is the perfect romantic anime because how they try to come closer to their crushes by working together, they just end up becoming closer with themselves. I loved Taiga because of her strong personality and how she always told people the way it should be. In fact I loved all the characters because the way they worked synced perfectly to make the two main characters fall in love with each other. It also had the perfect side effect to always make the other character jealous just like with Ryuuji with Ami making Taiga jealous. Anyway you may not understand what I mean considering
                  you may have not watched the anime yet. But it really is great because its what a real romantic comedy anime should be like. However if your the person who likes the main character to always have a great body than you may not like it considering all the girls beside the main one have a great body. Also if you want the main characters to actually end up with their designated crushes than you won't like this. Then again if you love that romance twist in anime you will love this, guaranteed. In the end this anime was great and I highly recommend you watch this.",8
"
                Toradora review
Taiga is so adorable <3
Story 8/10
The story  focuses around a boy named Ryuuji and a short-tempered  girl Taiga.The story is simple and predictable from the beginning but that doesn’t mean the anime is bad. Sometimes a simple story and a linear one too is what  a anime needs and Toradora fits perfect in that category.While the story may seem plain, the execution of the pacing is undeniably good at assuming a calm, relaxed flow for the majority of its run which, in turn, yields a satisfying romantic series as a result.
This slow pace helps us to get used to the characters
                  to their habits and how they react in a crisis situation when needed to face one. Also the interactions between the characters is also well done in this anime.
Toradora is not like many other romantic series out there that have characters fall in love simply just because. Toradora gives its audience room to breathe and focuses the first half of the show on building the friendship between the two main characters through silly, lighthearted antics, making developed romantic feelings between characters seem more realistic and sincere later down the line when things become more serious. However as we all know love hurts its not always easy to convey your feelings to the person you love without making any sacrifices along the hard and long road that you have to walk.
Also what’s another strong point in this anime is how romance is aborded and viewed from a mature perspective and that  adds a tone of maturity to the anime which is supposed to be for a younger audience targeted.  
The romance between Taiga and Ryuuji is not rushed at all its presented step by step and we are presented a steady and slow love story resembling  a real life  situation. Also the way the characters act in every situation is so natural and not forced at all going smoothly with the flow of the story like a leaf on the surface of a flowing river.
The way this anime treats love is such a good lesson of life for the viewers and especially for people who fall in love for the first time .It shows not only the “honey” and bright side of love but also the ugly part and the sacrifices you need to make to overcome the hardships of life. It tells you  how to treasure the person that is the most important  and has a special place in your heart but also how love is cruel sometimes and affects other persons around you directly or indirectly.
Another theme this show abords is human nature and how the human mind works and how they react given a certain situation. Everything is done so natural that it almost resemble real life situations that we confront with them daily.It shows envy, hatred, greed, but also love, sacrifice and the most common feeling all humans have the fear to hurt the person we care with words. Yes words hurt more than fists , a word spoken is  like 1000 knives stabbing  your heart  so this show gives a great importance the meaning of words.Our main character experiences both physical pain and emotional pain from the  person he loves Taiga.
What was at a moment kinda annoying in this show was the plot devices used to “fatigue” the story in some moments ( many attempts to confess their love )but that didn’t affect the flow of the story like I said previous it tried to bring a more real life  tone and make everything seem natural.
Characters 7/10 
The characters in toradora are generic school-romance  anime characters: We have the main character who has a unique trait and the same haircut , the heroine who is tsundere, short, flat chested, and gets easy angry , the megane friend of the mc, the short haircut girl joint added to the love triangle , and the big plot girl.What makes these characters different from the generic ones is the way they interact with each the way they influence the story and their development directly or indirectly.And toradora doesn’t disappoints us at all in that domain.
Ryuuji is  the main character and has the appearance of a delinquent but if you get to know him better he is a nice guy. He has good character development and it’s not the typical harem main character who cheats the girl she loves with other girls and always cares for her. He is also a very mature person because he has his own personal problems but despite that he helps others especially taiga in the first episodes with her love confession. This is if I must say the trigger for their friendship and love story.
Taiga is the heroine and has very short-tempered personality  but again that’s only on the surface of her character deep down she is a person who cares for the person she loves and has a big heart despite her appearance. 
One of Toradora’s strengths was allowing the supporting characters to have their moments in the spotlight. Because of this, we are able to obtain a deeper understanding of them and paint a better picture of them as characters. Also they help with the development of the love story between the two main characters directly or indirectly their influence is present along the story.
Ami, Minori and Yuusaku  are those minor characters that I mention above and toradora uses them so natural and at the perfect moments in the story that everything seemed planned beforehand. But its not that it’s the slow pace and natural pace of the story that contributes to that.
Another strong point about the characters and anime is the fact that shows the reactions of the characters when they get rejected or their feelings are accepted and their reactions who are very mature and so relayable to a real life situation. They cry, they laugh , but in the end they get  over it accepting the truth and start a new road in their life. Amazing!
Animation 7/10
The characters design is pleasant to the eye of the viewer and has his place in the story.
Sound 7/10
The opening is good. Also the voice actors act so natural in every situation so it’s a pleasure to watch them.
Enjoyment 9/10
One of the most beautifull love stories in a comedy -romance anime with a fitting ending and a life lesson for the viewer
Overall 8/10 
Toradora offered a beautifull love story and a nice life lesson for young couples who are just beginning to understand  how illogical and beautifull love is sometimes.
This is how a romance anime is done .",8
"
                Toradora! is one of the very few shows where, after seeing clips of it on YouTube, I immediately dropped everything and started watching it.  I’m not usually a fan of high-school romances, but something about the show really appealed to me.  And I can safely say that, after marathoning the series in one sitting, Toradora! is a wonderful, albeit flawed, show. 
Toradora! made me laugh, made me cry, and kept me entertained for all 25 of its episodes.  I particularly admire the show for being a refreshingly realistic and straightforward high-school romance anime without any kind of gimmick.  Also, while I
                  typically hate the love triangle trope, the love rhombus in Toradora! (which eventually evolves into a love pentagon!) served its purpose well and didn’t overstay its welcome. The five main characters are all exceedingly likeable and their dialogue is incredibly well-written, particularly the conversations between the male lead, Ryuji, and his initial love interest, Minori.  The side characters are enjoyable, too, particularly Ryuji’s airheaded yet well-intentioned mother and his grotesque (and occasionally obscene) pet parrot.  One minor complaint: the character designs of transfer-student Ami and student counsel president Sumire are so similar that for a while I thought they were the same character (again, minor complaint).  
The shining star of Toradora!, however, is Taiga, the female lead and one of the main reasons I had so much fun watching the show.  Fair warning: Taiga—a.k.a. the Palm-Top Tiger—is the quintessential anime tsundere, so if you’re not a fan of the tsundere archetype Toradora! might not be the show for you.  I’m not really into the archetype myself, though I adore Makise Kurisu from Steins;Gate and Hitagi Senjougahara from the Monogatari series.  Still, I found Taiga’s chemistry with Ryuji to be a thing to behold; their relationship is equal parts hilarious and heart-warming, and Taiga's character growth over the course of the series is expertly handled.  Also, let me say that her Japanese voice actress, Rie Kugimiya, turns in such a spot-on performance that I'm very reluctant to check out the English dub. 
Toradora! does drag in places; there are a couple of episodes mid-series where I felt the show was treading water.  Also, without spoiling anything, I didn’t like how the final two episodes played out; a lot of sudden and contrived drama was unnecessarily shoehorned in, which ended up muddying an otherwise satisfying conclusion.  While the art style is pleasing the animation is nothing spectacular, though when J.C.Staff wants to up the show’s visual game for a particular scene it can do so.  The first OP is really catchy, and I was disappointed when it was replaced halfway through the series (though the second OP is serviceable).  The soundtrack is quite good as well, especially the song “Lost My Pieces,” which has quickly become one of my favorite musical pieces from an anime.  
Overall, Toradora is a solid 8/10 and definitely worth your time checking out.",8
"
                this is perhaps my favorite anime!
i loved the plot to it and how the entire storyline, event by event, lead up to such a wonderful (yet suspensful) ending! my favorite scene was probably their little ""wedding rehersal"" scene in Ryuuji's grandparents house :)
the anime shows that everyone isn't quite who they seem. Ryuuji looks like a scary, intimidating guy but really he's harmless and Taiga looks like (as Ryuuji described her) a delicate doll but when she's really quite viscious! they're both misunderstood and by teaming up they start to understand eachothers circumstances and learn from one another. ",10
"
                Toradora! seems promising at first.
First several episodes were really enjoyable, however then the plot started being streched out, by a lot!
It reached it's peak during, in my opinion, one of the better fighting scenes, then it spiraled downhills.
It tried to pull the heartstrings, which kind of was successful.
I seriously hoped for a good ending, but every hope was destroyed. 
Yes, I have seen after-credits scene, but that doesn't change anything.
I've seen this anime twice, first time was few years back dubbed (bad choice), but forgot that I have seen it thanks to the terrible ending. At that time my rating was 5/10.
Second time, I finished it just shortly before writing this review, this time i watched it subbed. However I cannot say my rating for this anime has changed. If it weren't for the terrible ending, I would rate it 7/10, maybe 8/10. But sadly, I rate it 5/10",5
"
                Toradora is a drama / comedy / romantic anime. The story is overall very good as well as the character.
The anime is based on a drama romantic anime. But there are many comedy features that I really enjoyed.
The German dub is very good and I recommend watching it in German or Japanese.
Many people say that there is a happy ending, but in my opinion the ending is unsatisfactory.
That's the only bad thing, because I was at the end very confused. Because it seems like it will be a good ending and then it turns like ...
I highly recommend going in this anime with like no

                Personally I really enjoyed this anime. The history was really interesting, and it's really funny in some points of it. Also it's kind of dramatic sometimes. 
The history is not too simple, and not too complex which I think is pretty awesome and makes this anime really different from other Romance animes. Also, it didn't have any filler episodes. Sometimes while I'm watching an anime I need to skip some episodes because they're pointless, but not in this anime!
The ending was pretty awesome, 11/10. I loved the end. You definetly need to watch it :)
The art was great in my opinion, as well as the
                  sound!
The characters are awesome as well. The MC are a Tsundere girl and a really nice guy, and they are pretty well done as well as all the others.
I think if you watch this series and you're into Romance you'll love it!",9
"
                Having watched this series, in full, two times over.  I felt the need to write a review.  Now, let me first say, I don't particularly gravitate toward any one genre.  I've watched, say, everything from the Sailor Moon series to the Dragon Ball series and in-between.   My purpose here, is for you, the reader, to watch this series and recommend it to others.
Based off a video-game of the same title, Toradora! stands out among other titles in its genre(s).  To be brief, it is an anime I am willing to share with anyone I know in real life, regardless
                  if the person likes anime.  My review, below, contains no spoilers so feel free to read.
Story:
Without giving away anything, the story was great.  Some subplots could have been developed further but, alas, I can say that not knowing all subplots is part of life.  In that sense, I can forgive some minor subplots not being developed fully.  All, however, are concluded with none left ""hanging"" incomplete.  At the moment of this review, Toradora! is listed as Comedy, Romance, School, and Slice of Life.  It fits all those very well.  I would have to say it could easily be considered a Drama and it also has Action in it.  (Although, I would not call it an Action in of itself.)  The story is fairly realistic, being anime, and isn't too predictable.
Art:
The weakest area of the anime would be its artwork which could simply be considered decent for its age.  That said, I generally prefer modern anime art and have still thoroughly enjoyed Toradora!.  The art directs its audience to feel a certain way to a scene or character (or to suggest the audience ought to hold off on forming any conclusion).  That being said, the art is hardly lazy.  Characters and scenes are fully developed and look nice.  Moreover, emotion is conveyed to an amazing depth.  It is worth noting, I would highly suggest anyone to pay very close attention to the camera angles and the non-verbal (communication), in addition to the word choices of characters.
Sound:
Off the top of my head, I cannot recall any other anime I've watched where I've enjoyed, every--and I mean ""every""--song to it.  Toradora's openings and ending songs have all been enjoyable, to the point I don't skip them to get to the episode (which I find myself doing for plenty of other anime).  Sound within the episodes are reasonable and do not particularly stand out as a positive or negative in my memory.  It's the opening songs and credits that really been burned in to my mind.
Character:
At the forefront, I would have to say that character development is probably the strongest point of this anime (with exception of a couple minor characters that were not vital to the plot and were left undeveloped).  Pretty much every character was painted with a brush of realism.  Characters had real motivations behind their personality and their acts (not just some quick flash-back showing a traumatic event to justify how a character has acted throughout a whole series).  This kind of character development is something devoid in most anime and is very subtlety intertwined.  At its worst, characters will be understood through verbal communication with other characters or another character's epiphany about that character; however, the audience is given time to analyze a character's motivations through plenty of clues before that happens.  (I'm not saying everything is explained either.  Some things will be left up to audience interpretation, as it should be) Consequently, Toradora!, steers away from stereotypical tropes.  The closest component of a stereotypical aspect to anime you will find in character development is some slapstick violence (not too over-the-top) and, even then, characters will still get sick or hurt. 
Enjoyment:
Obviously if you're read my review up to this point, I don't really need to delve in to the category of enjoyment.   I clearly have enjoyed it and feel you clearly will also.  Be forewarned though, the pull toward binge-watching it is fairly strong.
Overall:
All components of this anime really make it special.  I just wish it was rated higher or would be more popular.   I hope you enjoyed my review.  Thank you for reading and considering my thoughts.

                I am not gonna write too big a review for you to read. Trying to keep it as small as possible.
As you read in the description the story is about two people who are helping each other win their own respective crushes. So what makes this anime different than the other Romantic anime?
The thing with Toradora is that it's very very much enjoyable and it hits you right in the feel. I love watching Romantic animes and this is so far the best that i have ever watched and it always will be.  
This anime shows how two people fall in love with each
                  other while helping them win over their own crushes and it's pretty damn well written and amazing.
It's funny and not boring at all.
They fight, they help each other and they keep you entertained till the very end. You will very much be hooked up from the first two episodes and you won't stop watching until the end, at least that's happened with me.
Trying to write a review without any spoiler is kinda tough when you are really new at writing reviews and stuff. 
So long version short, you should definitely give it a try and trust me you won't regret it. 
Thanks ;)",10
"
                Toradora is the definition of what a romantic comedy should be. This series really blended in the comedy with the romance. Never once does one overshadow the other. I really loved how the characters evolved as well. It was no surprise to see who ended up together but I'll leave that for you to find out. As for characters, Taiga made me really love the character type of tsundere. It was extremely hard to not fall in love with her. She's definitely the queen of tsunderes. For here alone, it is a must watch. I believe the ending could have been tweaked around a little
                  bit more since it kind of fell flat since the build up to it was so intense. Either way, I believe you will find something to enjoy if you watch this anime.",10
"
                Whats up Buttercups its R0B0 and well let's get started, this was recommended to me by a friend and I fell in love with it from the start. from the characters of Tiger and Ryuuji to the story and everything about it. this is at my top of the list to recommend and the show it almost 10 years or gone past it. you should watch it and I am willing to rewatch this in like a year because it pulls on heartstrings and it's just amazing. The OP and end the End songs were on point also with the OST. 
UGHh its just so
                  god damn good your gonna love it, I wish I watched this a lot and I'm saying a lot sooner

                *this review contains mild spoilers*
Oh, what a frustrating ride 'Toradora' is. For the first ten episodes or so, there was a certain sense of maturity to this romcom. Something that made you think, ""this anime is something special"". And then it took a complete nosedive into contrived melodrama. First of all, yes, the outcome is beyond predictable just after the first episode. You know exactly who will end up with who. But I don't have an issue with that, as long as the journey keeps me engaged. Things began fizzling out with wasted opportunities like the beach house episodes. Instead of setting up some cheeky
                  romantic mishaps, they instead give us a boring scare prank plot. After that, the FOUR parter covering the Cultural Festival. I mean, wow, was that tedious or what?? Then the student council election, and the oh-so forced and yawn-inducing Kitamura arc. People yelling, hollering, getting into physical fights over trivial, stupid things... What a mess. I always prefer these stories when they keep it simple, instead of tossing every character into a blender, creating pointless drama for the sake of it. Despite all that, there is great heart to this series. Some sweet moments. The conclusion was pretty unsatisfying, but there were parts of it that were somewhat touching. I debated on giving this either a 5 or a 6, and in the end I went with the latter, because this is a quality anime, when it's not throwing everything into the pot.",6
"
                (This review contains implied spoilers, I tried my best to avoid them. It is also my fully biased interpretation and opinion.)
Toradora! was one of the first romance anime I watched, and as such I consider it a great ""gateway"" anime as it effectively displayed some of the greatest modern feats the romance genre can accomplish. Although lately romance kind of has had a bad reputation for being immature, boring, and cliche (which I somewhat even agree upon), Toradora!, despite remaining true to those stereotypes, present us with a meaningful, character-driven, and conclusive story. 
Story:
Toradora! follows a very simple story structure comprised of several arcs, in
                  which each arc falls under a story archetype as you would typically see in many Slice of Life anime. Although this formula normally would be bland, it compensates for itself by having each arc serve the purpose of developing a specific character, or even several characters. While the first half of the series is more light-hearted and comedic, the second half arguably has a heavier mood. 
Characters:
The cast of Toradora! is definitely its strong suit, as each of the main characters contrast with one another and provide interesting character interactions. However, as a highly character-driven series, Toradora! excels not specifically through character development, but rather more precisely ""relationship development"" (although not everyone gets relatively equal amounts of development). Throughout each story arc, our main characters struggle to cope with each of their personal issues and internal conflicts, as well as overcome the various new obstacles they each encounter. As this occurs, they obtain deeper insight on the personalities and natures of one another as well as the effects that they consciously or unconsciously impose on each other. It is not until near the very end of the series, when they decide to make their final, influential decisions, be it either selfish or altruistic, but nonetheless satisfied with the ending results that were chosen.
Art and Sound:
One can expect relatively fluid animation and solid backgrounds from J.C Staff, and this series is no exception. There's little to say about the art itself; it is simply pleasing to look at and is not exceptional by any stretch of the imagination. 
The soundtrack, mainly comprised of simple piano pieces, also serves its purpose in amplifying the tone of the current scene, be it calming and quiet or loud and dramatic. Some songs in particular, such as ""Lost My Pieces"", really help in making the show a bit more dramatic and causing anime watchers to just lose it and start tearing up. 
Overall:
Toradora! presents to us a touching story whose main focus is on the  development of each character's persona as well as each of the relationships they maintain. Overall, I would highly recommend this series to anyone who would be interested in watching a character-driven romance series.",10
"
                Toradora! (2008)
Watched this a while ago and watched it again. This to me is the pinnacle of the Romantic Comedy genre. This show is just so amazing it was worth every second of it. My only regret is that I wasn't able to watch it when it came out to help it towards a season 2 or some future set OVA's that show the final conclusion. 
The show itself is a beautiful story that bases around romance. It shows real hardships in peoples lives from various stances. Characters that start off feeling like an antagonist ends up as some of the most lovable and memorable
                  characters. This is mainly aimed at 'Ami Kawashima' who at first feels like a feel bad influence and horrible person. In reality, she has a harsh world to deal with regardless of its benefits and to be fair she sees it for what it truly is. She has no rose-coloured spectacles that make everything seem better. Ami is also my favourite character for these reasons. She isn't alone in this view of the world either. She does see its beauty too. 
As we learn more about Taiga and Ryuuji we really get to know them and see them for truly wonderful characters. Both have prejudices about them that people have used against them but really they are just lovely souls finding their way to each other. Which is a surprise for themselves even. 
The show could have gone in many directions but this was my favourite. (Considering the options in the games also). 
The art for this old show is wonderful and perfect in its setting. 
The OP, ED, voice actors and sounds are so well done and perfectly fit the show to just bring it up a level higher. 
Characters as said are varied and so different in many ways. 
The show has some major milestones in the show. People putting others ahead of themselves and even the other way round. It feels like a real situation in that sense. 
The confrontation in the classroom in the latter episodes between Ryuuji and Taiga is just a spectacular moment that is so many episodes built up. 
The confession is just perfect even with how imperfect it is. 
The ending of the show after the last episode, after the final credits that final glimpse was just so fulfilling to know it has gone full circle and the story is left off in such a great way. 
The OVA's are all great too and add to the story.  
Overall, if you ever hesitate to watch this show, please watch it. It will be truly worth your time and will remain one of my absolute favourite shows in this genre.
It gave coming of age a new meaning.",10
"
                Jeez, how has it taken me this long to learn this wonderful slice of life existed.
Maybe I haven't watched enough animes, maybe I haven't experienced enough of life, but I'd like to think that my experiences are chosen for a reason, the way it was meant to be. 
I am super picky about my anime's because I like to see how much love someone can really shove into a piece of art such as this. This show was the most relatable and beautiful piece of art that I have ever seen and I will explain it in the following novel that may be just as
                  long as the light novel that Toradora started off as.
For this one, I'd actually like to start off with sound. Many people might think I'm crazy, but this show had the most original, perfect soundtrack throughout the whole show, but I'm not gonna tell you to go download the OST to show you what I mean. This sound gave me a TRUE human experience. Now, I only watched the dubbed version, but then again this is the best dubbing I have ever seen. The english voice actors were chosen so perfectly along with their personalities. The sound, if you really listen closely, absolutely guides this show like no other. (PS: the opening music and closing credits have some of the catchiest modern theme music that I have ever heard)
I don't know how Yuyuko Takemiya thought of all of this, but it screams instant classic. The next best thing, the story: It revolves around this one person who's honestly just trying to be normal and a bunch of his friends who are also just trying to be normal and happy, but we all know this is not how things play out for everyone, especially in highschool. What starts off as a very normal show becomes this chaotic, drama-filled slice of life (Yes, I just learned that it's a genre and didn't realize I was watching it all along). It lets you take a look into a parallel world where the physics of everything (especially love) play out just as they would here in real life. People trying to win eachother over, friends trying to help eachother instead of hurt them, lovers not understanding eachothers feelings. This show has it all and I think they are very modest about it. This may just be an anime, but it will fill your heart with feelings that you may have not felt in a long time. Good feelings. Feelings you might be too shy or too hurt to actually feel, but the important thing is that they are good. Every second of this story was filled with these feelings at different intensities. Some of it light and relaxed and some of it deep and exhausting (I'm a 23 year old dude who barely watches cheesy stuff [THIS WAS NOT CHEESY THOUGH, IT WAS REAL AF] and it even made me cry). This may be a show that just portrays the average life of highschoolers, but for you it will literally, and like LITERALLY, feel like a slice of life that you have to see to believe. Unbelievably incredible story. (It was like a movie [ARE YOU STILL CALLING ME CHEESY? I SWEAR, I WILL FIND YOU AND JUMP YOU. I AM NOT!!!!])
There aren't many ways to describe the characters without spoiling it, but what I can tell you is that these are no mascots in costumes. These are full-on human beings, I don't know how else to say it. Just such realistic characters. More real than live-action shows I see on TV. When you are watching this show you can almost hear their hearts beating. Also, it really puts a load of emphasis on how important friendships are and love is. While watching this show you may find yourself reconnecting with old friends or lovers or even apologizing or forgiving someone you may have felt disconnected from. It was a real wake up call for me and I hope there are more animes out there like this one so I can continue believing in being human and being with the people that I love.
The art was spectacular. It wasn't the most amazing work I've ever seen, but I can only say positive things about it. The characters themselves, first and foremost, looked absolutely beautiful. (Not just the one that looks like she would be from an H movie) I am talking about EVERY LAST CHARACTER! The main 5 look like people you would just love hanging out with. They are all attractive, fun, happy people and I think that is why this show is so addicting. Not everyone hangs out like this anymore, but this demonstrates that exactly. The art they put into each movement is so heartfelt and important. Every single little one. It's very impressive. The backgrounds are effin dope (I screenshotted a few) and some episodes really go all out on animation, especially the christmas one. But like I said, the characters and the animation for them are just breath-taking. If you are going to see this, like I said, prepare for an absolute piece of mind-blowing art.
Enjoyment. What a silly word ""enjoyment"". What really is enjoyment in the end? For some people I think it is watching some guy destroy an evil alien with a kamehameha and other times I feel like it's catching some pokemon deep in some stupid forest. For me enjoyment is finding the good in something, not necessarily the satisfaction and while Toradora was most definitely satisfying it EXCELLED in good. The reason I enjoyed it so much was because it reminded me that I have a heart, just like everyone else, and that as long as I have that everything will be just fine (My grandmother: Ok cheeseball) (Me: I SAID SHADDDDAAAAAPPPPPP!!!!!!). Let's be honest anything that looks, sounds, and feels as good as Toradora will have you coming back for more no matter what, but they just did such an excellent job. My enjoyment was the fact that someone had actually made this. That it existed. If you lose hope, no matter what age you are, this is a fun and semi-relaxed show that can truly bring hope back into your heart. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed Toradora!
Please watch this show and rate it a 10. It does not deserve anywhere near an 8. After I watched this show it was heartbreaking to see such a indescribable piece of art achieve such a mediocre score. It deserves a 20/10 if I'm being honest. Don't just sit there reading all the reviews. Go watch this short, life-like creation unfold in all it's beauty for yourself.",10
"
                I'm definitely going to be one of the black sheep with this anime. I didn't like it...at all. There were so many places where it could have been amazing. But it just fell flat. I was so tired of its cliches and story that I really wanted to drop it. But, being the person I am, I didn't drop it and tried to understand what was going on. 
I just didn't understand the hype. Everyone claims it's an amazing romance anime, but I just didn't see it. I can pull up a few other examples of romance animes that I like, and 'Toradora' seems to
                  pale in comparison.
First, though, I need to state the few things I liked in this anime. The very few.
The strange dynamic between Takasu and Taiga was interesting. 
At first, Taiga kept pulling the master-dog relationship. This, quite frankly, gave me the idea that we were about to have another 'Black Prince and Wolf Girl'--which I hate.  
But then it switched to a familial sort of relation. Takasu was the doting, and mildly overprotective, mother and Taiga the klutzy, forgetful child. In this relationship, it seemed unnatural for a romantic relationship to blossom since Takasu treated Taiga like a little kid.
Then, their relationship transformed into one of equal footing. This entire time the two of them had acted like they were on different levels. But once they figured out they were equal, it really changed the playing field. They could talk to each other honestly without fear of repercussions. 
Sadly, this came late in the anime which really was a sour point with me. But I'll address this later.
Another thing I liked was Taiga. Yes, Takasu was pretty cool too, but Taiga was very interesting. She was the tsundere of the anime. And it was so obvious that she was. 
This was until she had blossoming feelings for Takasu. Then, she stopped being very tsundere. Which threw me off, but I guess the people you love can change things. 
But Taiga's overall personality change was pretty great. She went from childish klutz to someone you could actually like. This happened when her dad entered the picture, and we saw Taiga's family problems. She finally showed the side of her that was strong and resilient. And I liked that side of her.
Something that could have been improved was if we saw more of Taiga's family problems. It could have put in a cool family dynamic. Especially with Takasu's missing father. It could have been a point of commonality between the two of them.
Instead, we get a hurried plot with Taiga's father, and her mother is only mentioned twice in the entire anime and only at the end. It was a little disappointing, but I guess not everything can come true.
Now, onto the ranting. Or, at least, the disagreement.
A major problem I had with this anime was the love...dodecahedron. 
We're introduced to multiple characters with different crushes. If I tried to explain all of them, I'd get tongue-tied. 
Not to mention all the characters that are introduced in the second half. They all, obviously, have to have crushes too. It's not like there are people in high school that don't have a crush on someone during their every waking moment. 
I'm tired of anime thinking that it's okay to shove a ton of crushes in to create tension. Sure, it's fine for Kitamura to like someone. Sure, it's fine for Kusheida to like someone. But it's not fine to have five main characters with a total of six or seven crushes. Please, make it stop. 
It's too much work for me to remember their changing emotions. I'm not saying it isn't particularly important, but I'm lost when it comes to their romantic lives. Keep it simple, okay? A love triangle or two. Maybe with Kitamura as a wise friend? Cool?
Another major problem was the influx of characters in the second half.
Remember how Taiga and Takasu were outcasts in their school with only one friend each? Yeah, well, that's thrown out of the window for tension purposes. They are now uber-popular and understood. As if the school-wide shunning is forgotten. 
Yes, people can change, but you have to show that change. We get, say, one or two people talking to Takasu, but Taiga is only seen with either Takasu or Kushieda. If you're going to introduce these guys as friends, at least show how they become friends with Takasu and Taiga. 
Not to mention all the romantic entanglements that come with them. Yes, side characters can have crushes. Yes, this can be done well. But you either focus on the main six or seven crushes or focus on the three or four from the side characters'. Don't mix it up. It gets too confusing to care.
I also hated the story. Okay, I didn't hate all of it, but I did hate how much time it spent on the 'let's help each other get with our crushes'. It was almost 2/3 this. I'd prefer it if the anime took only twelve episodes to say this. It's much better. We could spend the rest of the main with Takasu and Taiga coming to terms with their feelings for each other and less time rolling our eyes at their failed attempts to force romance onto a character they don't even love anymore. Nope. 
So, overall, this anime was a disappointment to me. I don't see the interest in this anime nor would I recommend it to others. There was so much wasted potential with this anime that I couldn't really enjoy it.
Verdict:
2.5/5",6
"
                Toradora is something you either love or hate. I loved it so i thought well my best friend would love it too so i told him to watch it and he just said that he couldn't watch more than 2 episodes because it was that boring and he dropped it right away, even though i rewatched it 2 or 3 times.
Basically the thing i loved the most was the story and the characters. Its rare to see stories like this.
[Spoiler] 
****The main characters are at first in love with the best friend of the other and so they help each other out and stuff and
                  they eventually fall for each other so yeah *****
The other loveable thing are the characters, i kind of fell in love with their friendship and realtionships, they are all really loveable and considerant of the other so it was lovely and i enjoyed it alot , thats why i rewatched it multiple times and if i had acces to the light novels i would love to read them although i hate reading and stuff.
so i would only recommend this to u if you like romance genre at least a little and enjoy romcom stories.",10
"
                Usually I don't go for romance anime, let alone school life ones. But
this one was interestingly good. The main positive of this one was the
two main characters. These two were so different and yet they had great
dynamics that made the anime entertaining and produced some funny
moments. The romance story, however, was a little weak, though I
personally didn't mind that much. But, because the last episodes were
dedicated to the love story and they were kind of tiring, it has to be
mentioned. Moreover, the art was okay, could have been better though.
Finally, the soundtrack was nice and cute enough for the concept of the
anime. So, 7 out

                Toradora...
Tvärhands-Taiga & Gäng-Ryuuji.
For a show which already had the greatest of expectations on it and which started off directly. It didn't even go one episode before the two protagonists was introduced and even met. They even started hanging out and what would follow for 24 more episodes had already been sprung into motion. There were no surprises left after episode number one. Everything was played out right in front of you and you know exactly what is going to happen for the rest of the show after the first episode.
Everything is brought out to light and there's nothing left for imagination. A grand bother in
                  my opinion. It was one of the most tsundere shows yet which had great expectations as it starts right into the action, but which falls on the finishing line as it doesn't quite reach all the way out there to meet the huge expectations lain upon itself.
I sat and waited and waited for events to unfurl which never did. I cried only once through this show, I really had to put an effort in to get as sentimental as I'd like to be since it was such an obvious show.
It was a show which had a lot of expectations, as said, and just didn't manage to live up to them all. It was a show where feelings as well as action doesn't quite reach all the way to your heart. The story development starts out real high and thus doesn't have much more to produce to reach its limit. Though as it was quite a long story (25 episodes) you really get familiar with the characters and really start to take a liking for some. Though those feelings never became satisfactory either because of the futility of the main story.
All in all I give this show an 8/10 because I really liked some of the characters and that you really got to share their history with all their problems and happiness and such. But that's the only aspect to lift this show from getting a 7.
It wasn't any particularly special. Though you really should watch it if you haven't. Just don't get your expectations up too much and try to ignore the obvious.",8
"
                This anime was truly incredible from the beginning to the end, I'm never bored and I enjoyed every episode of Toradora. I liked the play on words Toradora (Tora=Tiger (=Taiga) and Dora from Dragon=Ryuu in japanese), we all knew that Taiga and Ryuu will go out at the end, but the story was very rich and even supporting character were interesting. When I saw for the first time Kitamura Yuusaku and Kushieda Minori, I thought these charachters will be not very developed and I thought wrong because they were as developed as Taiga and Ryuu, that was the first time that I saw that in
                  a RomCom and that was very pleasent. The love for Minori wore Ryuu and the love for Yuusaku wore Taiga were really sincere, and real that was something I really liked. And finally, Toradora was the BEST RomCom I've ever seen, that was so incredible that I cried at the end. I hope that you will see Toradora.",10

                Name of anime: Toradora!
Genre: Romance, High School comedy
No. of episodes: 25
Review: A good romantic plot must have three features; Good plot continuation, Chemistry between couples and a heart touching ending. Maybe Toradora is that anime, which has the perfect use of each character and their emotions. Even at the end, you don’t feel that one of the characters was not needed; which we usually feel. The story focuses on two pair of friends, Takasu and Kitamura, Kushieda and Taiga. Due to some unexpected chain of funny and clumsy events, we get to know that Taiga is in love with Kitamura, whereas, Takasu is in love
                  with Kushieda. So, out of same position in their love life, both of them decided to help each other. Things also take a mature turn, when another character; Ami, is introduced in the anime. Taiga and Takasu keep on helping each other, regardless of their mistakes and eventually develop a special feeling between them, unknowingly. In my opinion, no matter how many times we check out their Tsundere style chemistry, we never get tired of it, and that’s the speciality of this anime.
Weakness: Being my favourite anime, I didn’t realised any of its mistakes, but if watched carefully, there are some of them. 
1) In the middle, episode 15 to 17, the plot becomes a little boring, even though it was essential part of the story.
2) At the end of the 17th episode, there's an unusual plot twist for a reason that was too small to be noticed when you are watching it for the first time. This makes those episodes boring.
Rating: I love this anime; it is that kind of anime, after finishing which, you will feel as if you lost something special. It’s due to that impact of the anime that I’m rating it 10 out of 10",10

                At first I was a little suspicious, but when I started to see one episode after another, I realized that the anime was worth seeing, that I even saw it until the end and I liked the anime.
I liked the anime, even a few years later ... a little life lesson ... because before and today there are many cases that appear in the anime.
what I can say is an anime to add to my list, and i can say favorites list.
usually I am not to see this type of anime but there are some who are worth seeing as by the example of this
                  anime.",10

                Warning possible Spoilers
So after doing one popular Romance anime (Your Lie in April) that I think is overrated we now come to another that I think is overrated, but was only a bit more enjoyable.
The story focuses on Taiga Aisaka and Ryuuji Takasu who find out they have have a crush on each others best friend so they decide to work together to help get with their crushes or do they?
Honestly I thought that the story wasn't too bad because for once it wasn't a Harem, but instead was a complicated love shape I did like how at first Taiga and Ryuuji were helping each
                  other to get with their crushes, but then it suddenly changed when things weren't going their way and incidents that happened which made the characters start feeling different, the concept was pretty damn good, but in execution it felt more like a bore fest with some enjoyable moments inbetween and the pacing really did drag for me I was literally wanting the show to get a move on at times because some of the situations that were going on just didn't get to me, I will admit when it was getting closer to the end the story was finally starting to heat up, but by then it was too late and the story left a poor mark on my mind.
The characters weren't too bad Taiga was actually a fun Tsundere true she would punch Ryuuji from time to time, but compared to other Tsundere's that's nothing so she felt like a pretty decent person to know plus she has a bit of a dark history with her family so you feel sorry for her at times especially when her father is involved, I liked the friendship between Ryuuji and Taiga they felt like two people you'd want as friends since they always ended up causing mischief for other people and it was actually fun seeing their relationship develop overtime until things suddenly changed between them.
The other supporting characters were hit and misses the hit's were Minori who is a very positive and energetic person whenever she showed it made the show funny, but she can be serious when time calls for it and there was also Ryuuji's mother Yasuko who doesn't seem like a very responsible mother she really does care for Ryuuji and the characters that missed for me were Ami who was just an annoying barrier for Taiga and Yuusaku and the only memorable things I remember about him was that he loved to strip in front of people a lot which seemed very awkward.
The artstyle was ok the characters didn't look as bland compared to other characters I've seem although Taiga does remind me of Louise from Familiar of Zero just with a different hair colour and less aggressive, there were generally bits of the show that were enjoyable and did make me laugh, but those moments were too far between each other and I was slowly losing interest over time.
The Romance was actually ok compared to some other anime's that I have seen over time and it was interesting how Taiga and Ryuuji's feelings for their crushes changed over the course of the show which then led to the eventual outcome that you've seen, but my problem with it is how quickly that change happened at some point they were both actually getting somewhere with their crushes, but then the situation changes very quickly and I was like WTF where did this come from so at times I thought the Romance was alright, but there was a lot of moments that sort of turned me off from it.
Overall I think this was a very mixed ride if you're someone looking for a more different take on the Romance genre then you might be interested, but it's a pretty slow and timid journey most of the time.",6
"
                Toradora! was very puzzling for me to sit down and watch, but surprisingly rewarding.
First off, I can only sometimes get into rom-coms, and it's usually only when the romantic subplot is in the back seat enough that it doesn't bog down the rest of the show and take away from the comedic value. Oddly enough, however, this anime is very easy to get into specifically because the romantic plot is right up front, working in perfect harmony with the jokes and eccentricities in other ways I haven't yet seen any other anime succeed in doing. From the get-go, you can see exactly which characters are
                  going to be the most important in getting the series to take off properly. So the story itself intertwines nicely with the other elements, including but not limited to its high amounts of drama. And you will get plenty of drama here.
The art direction reminds me a lot of Baka to Test. It's thoroughly bright and flashy without compromise, and all of the elements in the art direction work together well. Character designs are typical, but exercised skillfully, and animation is a nice strong point this anime has going for it. It feels very fluid and easy to watch, which may be part of the reason I stuck with it through and through. The sound work is roughly the same quality, a little over-the-top but nothing enough to hinder the series on other fronts as well.
I do love the characters in this series. I normally get annoyed when the characters take the forefront so commandingly, but they're strong enough to carry the series on their own. Aisaka Taiga, the main heroine, isn't exactly a tsundere, but comes pretty close to being one, leading her personality to some nicely integrated slapstick humor and a surprising amount of emotional depth. She's a character you simultaneously love to hate and enjoy watching way too much. And surprisingly, even though much of the rest of the cast stays out of the limelight, they are important enough and provide more than enough sustenance to keep the series afloat. It was a wise decision to keep the cast small.
In closing, Toradora! is a series I have a soft spot for. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a decent rom-com.",8
"
                First review so please don't hate and if I mess up, I'm sorry in advance!
As a new comer to anime after all this time I thought I wouldn't like anime at all, starting with SAO to various other fantasy/supernatural types of anime I thought I didn't really enjoy the romantic, school type genre.. I tried Golden Time but was bored after one episode due to there being no dubbed version for it.. Toradora really set the bar high for the next anime I decide to watch!
Overall: I thoroughly enjoyed the watch. So much so I watched it in one day I had off, from the
                  end of the first episode I thought 'this is gunna be good, good characters, good story!' and not to toot my own horn but I was right. At some times It felt kind of slow and was being dragged out for no reason but I guess that's what they had to do to fill the full 25 episodes and I understand that. The beginning started off on a nice slow pace making ground work for the full story and it worked perfectly.. The way the characters developed their story I had already known they were going to end up together at some point and was looking forward to it, towards the end I got very confused and actually first skipped off of the end credits and got very upset with the whole story thinking they would just end it by walking away. I was glad AFTER I saw the end credits it went that way.. (I bet alot of people were confused if they didn't watch the end credits and just saw Ryuuji walking away) 
Not part of the review but personal opinion: I was dead set on not watching these types of anime and actually avoided them up til now. Good I was a moron to think that these types of anime aren't good and don't have good story lines and just have basic/typical story lines where the characters meet, they hate each other, they hand out, they fall in love and boom ending! But this story actually dragged it out, made it enjoyable giving a twist to the whole anime scene as a whole for me!
I would recommended this anime to anyone whose looking for a way to get hit right in the feels as it hit me in the manly feels and made some type of liquid fall from my eyes.. ;) Thanks :D",10

Both of them are so cute together! What a great duo! And one of them definitely don't physically abuse the other! No no no! That's not it! Yeah right. When has this been entertaining? When has seeing a person physically abuse someone entertaining? So it's okay when a small cute girl does it on some boy? What's up with people?

I can't see how someone

I'm just shocked and displeased. Midget be breaking and entering and and almost stabbed my guy over here, and what does he do? Call the cops? No, he whips up a damn meal for her. What is this LOGICCCCCC??????????????? The brat breaking in this poor dudes home just because she thought he was creeping in on that letter. I would've beat the crap out of herrrrrr. He must really simps for shorties that much damn. 
And then after that, they bring up a sad backstory. Like ain't no backstory is going to make up for that?! Like being annoying as heck is not going to entertain anyone. And also being submissive too. I've seen so many clips of her bulling the poor dude, like isn't he on the urge or pulling out that ak47 in his delinquent dad's closet and go brrrr on her? Of course not, cuz he's ashamed of his past or whatever.

"
                This Was what got me into Anime. 
My friend dared me to watch this after losing a bet, because he knew I didn't like anime because mainly I never watched it and thought it was weird. How wrong I was
After a week of watching it entirely then re watching it next week I realized this was such an amazing show. Never liked romance, mainly a action or a Comedy kind of guy but the Characters made this so special to me. 
The slow bond between Ryuuji and Taiga slowly growing each episode, and all the other characters slowly being built each episode. I watched Ep
                  19 when Taiga ran out for Ryuuji and I had a breakdown while watching as she cried for him.
The final episode and the final after credit scene was so wholesome and sweet, I wished after that it never faded to a black screen and continued because I didnt want this show to end, I know its been a long time since the show was made but every year I hope theres a season 2 of this show even though there never will be a second season, its nice to be hopeful
""In this world there's this, thing that no ones ever seen. This thing, it's very kind and gentle. And if anyone could actually see it, there would be a whole bunch of people wanting to have it. Maybe that's why the world keeps it hidden from everyone. If it's hard to get, that makes it even more special. But one day, someone will find it. And whoever does, they'll be the one who was supposed to find it. Because that's the way it's meant to be.""

                *Contain some spoilers*
yaaaa... man this anime was amazing, well i have seen so many anime but in many of them didnt able to see what happened to the main characters who were in love... but in this one yup the ending was so good, i  really loved this anime.
well i like all kind of anime, like fantasy, harem, romance, sci-fi, action etc. so when i started to watch this anime i thought the end might be something normal like ""i love you"" and the reply will  be  ""i love you, too"" but this anime's end was amazing that's why i really loved
                  this anime than other love story anime. (the ones i have seen animes)
Our 2 protagonists Aisaka and Ryuuji become friends or maybe partners to help each other so the person they love will notice them but things doest go well and they comfort each that ""every thing will be all right dont worry move forward, im with you"" something like that. and than in the end fall in love with each other. 
There were so many ups and downs points in anime that made this anime more interesting that ""now what are they going to next, how they are going to solve the things"", and that part in this anime i liked bcz with this you will learn something that might will help you in real life.
Story : 
as for story it was amazing i really loved the story, the misunderstandings and than trying to solve them, the ups and downs in love, sometime happy events, sometime sad events, and then try to move forward. 
And the ending was so good, the way they ended the anime i really loved it, first i thought ""are they really going to run away like that and then going to come back later or something"" but all ended very well in the end and finally a ""I love you"" in the end :D
the whole story was amazing fighting, solving, misunderstanding, sadness, and love.

"
                I'm not the type of guy who usually watches romance anime and I've always avoided most things romance related since I deemed it to be a boring genre and one that's just simply not meant for me. Because of this I have just watched one other romance anime besides Toradora. But now that I have finished Toradora I can happily say that I was very wrong, romance can be just as interesting, if not more interesting than any other genre. Toradora was so good that it had me hooked since episode one and I finished watching it in just two days. It was, in fact,
                  so good that it became my favourite anime of all time and honestly I don't think that anything can top it off.  
But what's the reason that I love this anime so much?
Well the main reason are the characters themselves. Every character is different and you will never find two that are the same. Firstly lest's talk about Ryuuji. He's very likeable and a pretty realistic character. He loves cooking and doing various chores. He's also oblivious to girls liking him. Taiga was by far my favourite character. Despite her being violent at times she's actually really kind at heart. We later learn that her violence is caused by the problems in her family, well mainly the problems with her father. Also her violent tendencies and verbal harrassing towards Ryuuji slowly dissapear and by the end of the anime she's nothing like her former self.  Yuusaku is Ryuuji's best friend and he really cares for him. He's also the popular kid in class, which is very weird since he looks like an average nerd in anime. In all honesty I wasn't really interested in him, but he was still a good character. Minorin was a very interesting character. She's hyperactive, very friendly and somewhat crazy, but in a good way. She's also a pretty selfless person and does everything she can to help those around her. Amin was the character that grew and changed the most out of Ryuuji and Taiga's three friends. When we first meet her in episode five we are made to believe that she's a stuck up bitch and because of this I really disliked her a lot. But as the anime progresses we learn more about her and why she acts like she does. And like I previously mentioned she also grows a lot as a person and by the end I ended up liking her a lot. Also the background characters were all pretty well written and didn't feel like random people without personalities.
Another strong suit of Toradora is the story. At the first glance you might think that it's just another generic highscool romance which there are a lot of currently, but in reality it's so much more. I can't really go into details without spoiling stuff so I'll say what I can. The story mostly avoids cliches which is pretty rare for anime that come out nowadays. The comedic moments sprinkled in the first half were really enjoyable, but I also loved how they started happening less and less and towards the end they were almost non-existant since everything became very serious. I was also really emotionally invested into Toradora which usually doesn't happen with other anime I watch and when I finished it I was left with the feeling of emptiness and sadness in me. The ending was good and altough I had hoped for more closure, I was still satisfied with it. Thankfuly there was a solution for the closure I was looking for and that came in the form of the last chapter of the light novel. I really crave for more Toradora, but seeing as it has been fourteen years since it came out I'm sure that there won't ever be a second season.
Also I just have to mention that the art and animation were also pretty good, especially for a 2008 anime.
All in all this is my favourite anime by far. It was great and it sparked a interest for romance in me, so because of that I have to recommend it to everyone.",10
"
                Toradora! A spoiler free review. 
   For a long time I truly believed there are only two types of people that everyone has in their life. 1. A person who understands you but doesn't care about you. or 2. A person who cares about you but doesn't understand you. Even looking at this statement I can categorize the people in my life. Most of my family I believe care for me but really don't understand me while some people I've met through friends, work and school truly understood me, but because of that understanding, didn't give a damn. 
I think we do this
                  kinda thing in defense of being hurt. Or at least, I think I do this sort of thing to avoid being hurt. I always thought it'd be great if I could meet someone that both cared about me and understood me. But asking for that is assuming that people need to be understood. That everything has a hidden meaning. Maybe the words ""What are you doing later?"" doesn't mean ""I love spending time with you and only you"" but ""What are you doing?"" It's terrifying sometimes to think how people can be so forward when we see it as impossible.
Even though not everything can be understood about someone else I think I was wrong my whole life. Sometimes caring about a person is to accept you won't understand them or their feelings. But you choose to be there anyway. And sometimes to understand a person is to show that you're willing to care about them more than yourself. 
This show is my favorite love story. You don't need to understand love. You don't need to care. The second you have to convince yourself you like someone or something, you don't. Love is not about that. I didn't have to think about loving this show or its characters. I just did. It doesn't need anymore than that. And that's pretty cool.",9
"
                I have to start out by saying I'm not a rom/com guy.  Especially melodramatic teen/high school romance storylines.  They tend to be trope-filled messes with wishy-washy scripts, filler episodes that exist for fan service shots and contractual episode counts, and your standard stock of insufferable teenage stereotypes.  To be honest, the only reason I hit ""play"" on this series was the desperation for new content mixed with Netflix constantly throwing this series to the top of my suggestions.
I didn't go into it with much hope, but man I was pleasantly surprised.  That isn't to say this series didn't contain a lot
                  of the stuff that I'm not fond of in rom/coms, but the execution of the story pulled through and made it one of my current favorite series.  I think a big part of what made the series so entertaining was that the writers were not scared to go over the top when the story allowed for it.  It takes a special talent to make me laugh at slapstick humor, especially when it's accentuated by what I swear were old Hannah-Barbara sound stings, but the timing for the humor was practically air-tight, and I can appreciate that in an animated series.
While the story is a rom/com, it felt like a lot of the romance aspect of it was there to move along the underlying plot of ""getting prepared to have to leave the fun and simple high school life behind and face the grim, dark future of adulthood"", especially in the back half of the series.  Major life decisions are suddenly forced upon them while they're still in the playing softball and going on class ski trips phase of their lives, and that's all in the back of their minds while they're trying to figure out who they're taking to the big dance or whatever.  Brash decisions made during highly emotional moments rarely turn out to be the correct course of action, and that is shown on more than one occasion in the series, which I (technically an adult) appreciated as a message.
The characters were, to put it simply, a treat.  I thought if anyone would get me to quit the series, it would be super-giga-mega-tsundere Taiga, but she turned out to be surprisingly easy to enjoy when she was balanced out with insecurity and clumsiness.  The chemistry between her and the comparatively shy neat-freak Ryuuji somehow didn't feel forced.  Early on in series, I would almost forget they were supposed to be helping each other end up with other people because they just seemed like a good fit from the beginning.  If anything, I got annoyed that they kept ignoring how well they got along to pursue other characters (the energetic-and-slowly-drifting-further-into-insanity Kushieda for Ryuuji, and the ever-chipper-and-dense-as-redwood Kitamura for Taiga) that seemed okay on the surface, but would not have been good matches for them.  Then again, youthful romance often involves putting someone up onto a pedestal they probably shouldn't be on.  Oh yeah, and the hot, bitchy model Kawashima is also there ... supposedly to show that Ryuuji isn't a shallow character since he doesn't spend every second she's in the room drooling over her like all the other kids in the class.  I think my issue with her was that the show already had enough tsundere with Taiga, so Kawashima's character was sort of drowned out to a mere nuisance for most of the series.  She did have a decent character arc, though, showing an evolution from a one-note character to someone with a little more depth by the end of the series.
The supporting characters are mostly good, too.  They did their jobs, which was to support the story and keep it moving and throw in some comic relief every once in a while.  There were no sudden non-sequiturs into the unnecessary back-story of the redhead who also had a thing for Kitamura, or the good-natured class dumbass Haruta.  Ryuuji's mom pretty much stole the scene whenever she was around, but she wasn't over-used.  And I looked forward to every scene with Yuri, the well meaning forever-single teacher who was in a constant struggle to not give up on her dreams of romance, and to keep hold of her sanity while trying to guide the very special kids of 2-C.  I love her and I hope she found her happiness.
But the big question is, of course, was the ending satisfying?  The answer is yeeeeesssssss (question mark)?  I suppose it depends on your point of view.  The relationship statuses of the main characters are finally sorted out and set in stone, but if you're looking for an episode that ends with a nice, relaxing glimpse into a picturesque future where the main ship is sailing along nicely, you might end up kind of disappointed.  However, it's because the final episode still has plot to get through, and it plays out all the way past the ending credits.  If anything can be said of the series, it's that it does not waste time on filler.  So while the happy ending is there, it feels a bit abrupt, though not in a series-destroying way.  I probably could have used about 5 more minutes of content, though.
Still, this one does go up on the ""Recommend"" list.",9
"
                I absolutely enjoyed Toradora!
We all need a good romance anime from time to time, but sometimes you're not up to the typical shoujo. Introducing Toradora! The story was very entertaining and the comedy puts you in a good mood without feeling slapped onto the story.
The art was nice, it had a good twist from a normal manga style (on Taiga the edges in the lineart are rougher) There was a nice variety to the voice actors as well.
The characters took me by surprise! I was expecting a normal love triangle with the typical tsundere but Toradora said no. They pulled off the love triangle marvellously
                  and gave a good ending that made me feel really satisfied. There's nothing worse than feeling unsatisfied at the end of an anime.
I truly loved this anime, and it's up there in my list of favourites. There's something special to it that I can't quite put my finger on.
I would recommend to anyone looking for a romance and comedy anime that's fun, but has its bag of emotional scenes as well.",9

First Review! Oh boy... Where to start. 
I've heard plenty about Toradora! before I had watched it, luckily nothing that had spoiled anything for me so I was able to enjoy the anime without prior expectations. Yet, as the story went on I very quickly formed hopes of where I 
wanted this story to go and I was definently not let down. 
Starting from the beginning, we meet most of the characters and got a basic understand what everyone was like, or so I had thought. Getting further into each episode I started gaining a much deeper connection to the characters
                  so I believe the Writers and Directors did a fantastic job matching my emotions as a viewer, to those of the characters. Roughly about half way through is when I realized many of the hidden truths behind the characters and thats when I quickly began to really want the story to head in a certain direction, however this is also when many characters, the enviroments, and even the drama, have such a sudden change of pace that It threw me right off. *I liked it!* Luckily for me in particular, I let myself get involved into the story so that I was able to feel a connection with everyone and I think that really added to my enjoyment. Comes near the end and just like all the episodes before, i stayed right here at the edge of my seat unable to stop watching all the way, Until the end. overall, I felt almost unsatisfied as it came to a close however at the same time I wouldn't have wanted it to go any other way.
The Story was very well paced. Starting slow, cruising through with great developments in the middle only to finish with an excellent boom! Every episode was a good time and always left me wanting more which to be honest, is the only reason it gets an 8 and not any higher, because I selfishly want more haha!
The Art was satisfying and always did its job to help you understand everything around you, as well the animations with it were well done at times, and Very well done in certain moments of intrest which I'd have to say definently added to my enjoyment of special scenes!
The Sound, I Honestly have zero experience with sound other than the fact that it is great quality. I suppose I may also add that the soundtrack for the series was well done and the timing some tracks took place were exactly that, very well timed.
The Characters. I personally Love! just absolutely love when I am able to involved and empathize with the characters, so when any anime can really get me to relate to the characters then I simply fall in love! Toradora! was able to do that for me :)
My Enjoyment of everything was very high, leaves me wanting more and at the same time, leaves me with a sense of... not being complete yet was very well completed. Perhaps that just ties into my needing more so that I can continue to delve into this beautiful anime Toradora!
The Overall Score is ofcourse a simple average of the other topics mentioned above! Not to mention I was actually bothered to write a review, is saying quite a bit as well :D
I made this review for myself, gave me time to reflect on Toradora!, which i had just finished no more than 30 minutes ago but I do hope this can be useful to anyone else that gets the chance to read it as well.
Thanks

                All 10s. Biased reviewer?
I think not.
What I like about ToraDora is that it is character driven and that our beloved main characters actually have a goal... What's interesting is how they mature by trying to reach that goal. Ironically, they become mature enough to forget about that goal (in case you were wondering, that goal is RyujixMinorin and TaigaxKitamura). Or, not ""forget"" but they move on.
The two main characters are not the only ones developing. Minorin is a character driven by a motto: create happiness for yourself, and don't let anyone make your happiness for you. That gets you thinking, because if one would follow
                  such a motto for the rest of their life, they would end up in loneliness because they wouldn't accept anyone's help.
Ryuji and Taiga's relationship is very much like partners in crime in the first part, but then they get to understand each other more. Ryuji turns out to be straightforward, but Taiga likes to go roundabout (e.g. instead of talking directly with her father she accepted her father's help, in short she was passive). There was this one scene where Taiga falcon-kicks a table that was right next to a pool. Consider Ryuji's stance in this situation: he is acting like Taiga's conscience ""Why not? Why not? Why not?"" he keeps on asking and then BAM! Taiga kicks the table, because Ryuji has reminded her of her insecurities. Ryuji thinks: why can't she just be straightforward?
Eventually, this relationship fosters an attachment which leads to RyujixTaiga. The characters like Kitamura are not explored well enough, but that's excusable because he is farther away from the core of the storyline, I mean we wouldn't want to also know the story of a random guy on the street just because we didn't get to explore his character very well, it's just not how the story goes.
The artwork is magnificent because of the attention to the background, wow. It gives the show a more realistic feel, which adds on to the deep psychologies of the characters.
I'm not going to dissect every character.
The music is great, especially at the instance where Taiga runs in the Christmas episode, wow. It's something you just have to feel, you know what I mean?
So far, ToraDora is uncontested as the show that deals with growing up (particularly during school years), and such complex character psychology. Wow. That's all I gotta say. Wow.
It's second view material, but it's not something like Inception.",10

                I came to this show about 10 years after its initial broadcasting, in order to do some more research on the tsundere phenomenon - and I was not disappointed. The Palm Top Tiger is simply one of the most astonishing teens I have ever seen in a TV show, anime or not - a girl who is so unsecure about everything in and around her live that she becomes violent beyond what would be socially acceptable! And yet you feel the sweetness and the longing for a normal life in her. If you are unable to take this wonderful little ball of fury to your
                  heart, it is probably because you prefer the easy way in life and in your relationships! Good for you, maybe, but not all of us are like that… 
Definitely not our main hero, Ryuuji. He puts up with her and all her antics. Not because he would immediately understand that no matter what he may be suffering from her, the one who is suffering most is Taiga herself. No, as pretty much any 16-year old high school kid, he generally doesn’t understand a lot, and girls the least. But he has this one character flaw, quite unusual for a boy his age (and teen shows). He is a cleanliness freak, and so the disorderly state in which he finds Taiga immediately peaks his interest, then his paternal, and finally his brotherly feelings. He rather inadvertently manages to turn Taiga’s life around, a point he realizes when he discovers that she actually separates her waste on her own (I guess the deep symbology of this small scene is lost on pretty much anybody outside Japan, except us Germans…)
So in the end, his feelings have become more than brotherly, and more than that, they are reciprocated. I fully understand the displeasure of some viewers with the story’s ending. Yes, it is rushed, and yes, while it is more than understandable that Taiga wanted to go away from Ryuuji until she fully managed to be on her own, it came too abrupt and felt too constructed. But that is the way these soap operas are, once the end approaches. Such series are never completely thought out from the beginning, and more often than not the ends feel somewhat hasty and like something the writers pulled out of their hats in the very last second. 
Unfortunately it also did not leave enough space for a little more detailed look into Ami’s development. She had definitely not been nice deep down inside in the beginning, but the acceptance and friendship she received helped her find her way. While it will never be possible to completely flesh out every character in such shows, she definitely would have been worth to have some more time dedicated to her own coming-of-age.
All in all, one of the nicest “regular” teen shows I have ever seen (“regular” meaning that it does not involve slaying vampires or the like). Admittedly with its share of exaggeration bordering the unrealistic (a katana fight in the classroom), some strange genre-specific tropes (but maybe 16 year old school girls living on their own are indeed a thing in Japan, after all, how would I know?), and some of the shenanigans of loves-me-loves-me-not and if-the-only-had-talked inherent to soap operas that do not really contribute to the overall story arch. But, hey, we get to spend some quality time with a number of lovely characters, and there are definitely worse things to do with your free hours!",8
"
                Overall - First of all I'd like to admit to crying 3 times throughout this anime. Maybe I'm just emotional but damn, I did not expect to cry. I went into this thinking it would be your typical run of the mill, slice of life, highschool rom-com anime with the staple tsundere and frustrating love triangles, but I was pleasantly surprised when this was not the case. It turned out to be my favorite anime before I even finished it. I've watched my fair share of seasonal anime, romcom anime, and slice of life anime, each of which repeat the same game winning plot tactics,
                  frying my brain to a crisp. But Toradora truly set the bar high for me in many regards.
Story - I was more than pleased with the story line. It was somewhat refreshing, and appealed to my taste, while not being some trashy and tasteless fan service anime that I would be embarrassed to be seen watching. The story was different enough from most to have my heart, while still staying familiar enough to be in my comfort zone and still be refreshing to watch.
Art - I liked the art for the type of anime Toradora is. It wasn't boring and most of the characters had distinguished features, so if I traded their hair styles amongst them they wouldn't all look the same. It also wasn't too bright as if someone was constantly hovering over each seen with a bright ass fluorescent light bulb and it wasn't too bland. However it did have the whole thing where maybe too many scenes were in the classroom or the same place usually, but it made sense in accordance with the plot. Also I'd like to say that I was pleased with the art for the Christmas episodes. I'm always a sucker for Christmas episodes in anime, especially when they remind me of the Christmas look
Sound - I'm not an expert on sound but I think most of the sounds were appropriate and I can say for sure they added onto the vibe whenever there was sound outside of dialogue. I will also venture to say that every intro song made it into my personal top 25 anime intros, being very catchy and fun to listen to overall.
Characters - I loved every character. I felt like their personalities were real, and I was entertained by the fact that each one had a look that, in some way shape or form, was related to their personality. Like Ryuji's mean looking eyes with his kindness, Taiga's height with her temper, Minori's flamboyance and outward appearance of bliss and the embodiment of 'sugar, spice and everything nice' to match her complicated feelings and her hidden caring nature. Every character has a quirk worth mentioning and they all fit together into the story perfectly to bring the whole thing into the final stage of what it is, and make it rise up to S-Tier anime. Also, good waifus ;)
Enjoyment - I enjoyed this so much even though I have watched a decent many other animes. I loved it so much in fact that I was a little depressed and almost cried a 4th time when I finished it. I'm so glad to have been blessed by finding this anime and watching it after so long since my entrance onto the anime scene. It somehow gives me hope at the same time as tearing it away for all the other anime in my 'plan to watch' list
Edit- High rewatch value for sure, really loved watching it a 2nd and 3rd time",10
"
                Toradora! is one of my more favorite romantic comedies.  Anime tends to have a horrible romantic theme of being over dramatic but Toradora! brings enough comedy to the story to make the romance bearable.
Toradora! is a cute story between two students that are very misunderstood.  Their looks and outward attitudes often scare people away.  The story follows their struggles to belong and find love in a world where most people have already decided their fate.  I found myself relating to the main female character; a girl that hid her insecurities by trying to intimidate others.
The character development is also very real
                  especially for high school students.  Its great when characters change throughout the show even in ways you're not expecting.
I've watched Toradora! several times. It's always a great anime to watch if you're feeling in the dumps about relationships (love or otherwise) and just want to watch friend's shenanigans.",8

                Toradora Review (NO SPOILERS)
Time to review another one of those shows that I've heard a lot of praise on, but never got around to watching until much much later! Toradora! A show that my computer REALLY wants to autocorrect into Toreador. But whatever! Let's talk about the show. If I had to sum it up in a few words, I would say to compare it to Haruhi Suzumiya, get rid of all the super natural elements, and replace them with romance elements. While it is a romance show, I feel it tends to focus a lot more on the comedy side of a romcom. However,
                  the show does a good job at keeping me intrigued and never making a comedy moment bring the story progress to a halt. The characters are just so perfect when interacting with one another, that comedy just happens, regardless. Though, the show does still have its fair share of emotional moments that got you really involved with its characters and how everything was going to turn out for them. Really, this show takes a lot of different routes and does them VERY well. It does comedy without being too obnoxious and it does romance without being too unintelligent. 
The story isn't completely based on just your typical romance of one guy having to choose between 5 different girls, however. It kinda takes the whole main cast for the ride when dealing with these relationships. And while it does have the inevitable fighting portions where people are mad at one another for not getting to be with the person of their choice, it's not always like that. I'm glad that there's still plenty of moments where they get along with one another, after certain romantic obstacles have been settled, and I especially like it when something comes up that isn't related to the romance. This is especially apparent around the halfway point and was probably my favorite part of the show. It unfortunately didn't touch on that moment as much as I would've liked, but I still enjoyed it being there.
Something this show deserves MAJOR props for is its characters. This cast is amazing. Both on their own and when interacting with one another. Every single combination of people has its own unique and fun turnout that always has you excited to see them together. Something I'm really glad about is that the entire main cast, and most of the side cast is important. They could've VERY easily had Kushieda and Kitamura be strictly side characters whose only purpose would be to add to a conversation in a scene, but not actually have any depth of their own. But both of them are very important and have their own stories and journeys, which made their presence in the show that much more enjoyable. 
Now as much as I wanna praise them for doing that with these two characters, the show kinda forgets the lesson it just passed in by making some other side characters a lot more involved in the show. And not involved, as in having their own story. As in, what I just said about them just being there for the sake of giving the main characters someone else to talk to. This is mainly for the classmate side characters. It honestly got to the point where I dreaded ever seeing them on screen, because the main characters are just so much more fun and I wanna get back to focusing on them, rather than these guys who have no purpose and no real end game, when all is said and done. However, when looking at both the teacher and the main protagonist's mother as side characters, they do VERY good jobs at doing what they do. The teacher is goofy and fun to watch, but she's able to be taken into serious moments to have important moments with the main characters. Same with the mom, she's VERY wacky and very fun to watch. But she's just always in the right place at the right time. Being that person left at home base, where the main character can discuss the events of the outside world to, and get an unbiased, yet still completely supportive opinion on the matter at hand. Both of them fulfilled their roles perfectly, and much more. And while I understand that it may not have been easy to stick with the same 5 main characters throughout the entire show, I wish that the minor characters that they threw in were just half as interesting as the main cast.
The animation is very bright and colorful. And in a good way. Colors and movement look sharp and nicely detailed. It's very pleasing to look at, and it does have some very stellar moments, particularly at night, where the animation really shines. As far as the music, I hear a lot of people praise it. Personally, I'm not too crazy over it. I wanna say it's a poor man's version of Clannad's soundtrack, but I feel that's a bit harsh. It's not bad at all, it's just painfully average. The opening, however, is one of the catchiest openings out there. I wasn't too crazy about it at first, but I really enjoyed watching and listening to it, before every episode. The second opening that's introduced in the half way point, however, while it's not a bad song, it's nothing compared to the first one. And finally, the sub vs dub debate. I was actually really torn on which one I wanted to watch. I actually would go back and forth when watching, switching between sub and dub, just because I couldn't decide. Ultimately, I decided to go with the Japanese version, though that may simply be because Taiga is voiced by Iori Minase from The iDOLM@STER. And as everyone is far too well aware of by this point... I. LOVE. THE. iDOLM@STER. Though, Iori was always my least favorite character in The iDOLM@STER, voice wise. I was VERY surprised to find out that she voiced Taiga in this because the two sound NOTHING alike. It gave me much more respect and appreciation for Iori's voice actor, and I really cannot say enough good about their performance in this show. So ya. Both the Japanese and English versions get a pass from me. So pick whichever one you prefer.
In conclusion, Toradora was everything I wanted it to be, and more. While nothing really blew my mind, I have a very high appreciation for what this show pulled off. Not a single episode was a drag or a bore, though I do feel that this show took a long time to finish. It's only 25 episodes, but it just felt like it was taking forever to complete. That's not necessarily a bad thing, considering I enjoyed the journey so much. But I wouldn't of minded seeing some stuff get sped up a bit. Specifically the side characters. I can honestly recommend this show to anyone, regardless if they like or dislike romance or comedy. It does both of those things REALLY well, so people who like that sort of thing will enjoy seeing it done so well. But at the same time, it's not all up in your face or poorly executed, like some other shows are, so I can recommend it to people who aren't too fond of the genre and want something that isn't too overwhelming in those themes. I'm not sure if I wanna put this in my top 10 favorite anime of all time list, though. I kinda wanna wait a bit and finish everything on my To Watch List before making that call, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this show found a spot on there, in the end.
Toradora gets a 9.5/10",9
"
                In short, Toradora is a really great Rom-Com SOL that is indefinitely well rounded in all aspects. I found myself enjoying it every step of the way. It has a really sleek nostalgic presentation and is really comfy in its own way. Every relevant character is dynamic. The animation is just dazzling in my personal opinion for 2008. It's very very nostalgic. It's cute, funny, memorable and very re-watchable. It does a really good job taking the concept of a ""Tsundere"" character and making them unconventional. I'd say its pretty worthy of being a top 10 show. Indeed the basis of the show itself is
                  something we've seen many times, but this show is special in its own fathomable way.",10

                I must say that Toradora is such a adorable and great series, was a little botherd with minori but the series was still so god damn great that i still cant give it a less rating then 10.
I hope i can find an anime similar to this or that they continue the series.
It would be cool to have something similar but also scifi like bleach or something :P

                I'm going into heavy heavy spoilers here so if you haven't watched this please please pleaaaseee don't read my review. Even if you aren't that into romance anime I think this one is really worth a shot, it's popular for a reason.
I remember when I tried to watch this anime back in like 2015 and saw Ryuji in the first episode in the mirror and said ""ew his eyes look weird"" and dropped it. 6 years later I've finally come back around to it. This isn't really related to anything I'm gonna say here but I thought it was funny.
The first half of the show
                  in my eyes pretty much just served as a build up to learning all of the characters and their relationships w/ each other, specifically Taiga and Ryuji's of course. In the first episode Taiga is insufferable and absolutely makes no sense but it comes around; and it makes sense with her character in the end. It reminds me of the first season of clannad that was like the sunshine and roses before season 2. Of course there is still significant character development here (and the theme song is reallllly good 8/10 on that one), but I'm more going to focus on the latter half of the show.
But before I get to that I'm gonna go over my thoughts on some of the characters. Kawashima was really interesting throughout the entire show, after she dropped her act I really grew to like her because of how petty and passive aggressive she was. In a show with so much teenage angst and just general phoniness among the characters , I think she was a really awesome contrast. She called out Ryuji alllll the time for chasing Minori despite being in love with Taiga claiming ""somebody's gonna get hurt"", which very much ends up being the case. This also plays into her still faking a bit herself, trying to act so grown and above all the teenage drama going on when she herself wanted Ryuji. I think she gets a little bit ripped off development wise, she never really gets to admit how she feels explicitly, but I think that fits her character well.
Minori is definitely the most aggravating character for me at least, her general act is charming and entertaining but she serves as a major roadblock in Ryuji and Taiga's relationship, (which I guess is only annoying as the viewer) but she is still a fantastic character. Minori is thrown into a very difficult situation loving Ryuji but having to still factor in how Taiga (and essentially Ryuji) feels, despite Taiga's best efforts to throw Ryuji at her. I like how jealous and angry she gets at Ryuji at points in the show, she can be a real drama queen but it's understandable when her best friend is clearly being hurt and Ryuji just cannot make a decision for the life of him. She is a really complicated character and her whole ghost and UFO analogy sticks around wayyyyyyy too long but she's one of the best characters. (As in being well designed but still aggravating in context of the story and romance between Taiga and Ryuji. I hope I'm making sense here.)
Kitamura is different from the rest of the cast by being the most simple in my eyes. He has his little Class President arc that is alright, but it gets resolved pretty quickly. I think he's a necessary character in the main cast, he is a nice break from the constant drama and hubba-bubba on screen, and serves as the only other significant male character in the show. Once his arc with Taiga is resolved he is more just around for the ride, which I don't think is a bad thing.
The ending of the show is really what makes Toradora! a hood classic to me (other than it's excellent characters). Episode 24 was initially dog doo-doo on first watch and made me wanna throw up and die. Ryuji and Taiga's random [major major spoiler last chance to turn away] running away from home and leaving behind everything to go elope after FINALLY admitting how they felt for each other had my eyes doing full 360 rotations in my head. It felt like I'd put up with a frankly disgusting amount of melodrama and anime romance angst only to get a complete nonsensical fantasy as an ending. ALSO RYUJI WAS TRIPPING ROASTING HIS MOM LIKE THAT NIGGA SHE GAVE UP EVERYTHING FOR YOU SPEAK TO HER WITH SOME RESPECT. 
Then episode 25 plays masterfully just mwah *chef's kiss* off of it. I love love love lovvvvvvveeeeeeee Taiga's decision to leave Ryuji and the school in the end and fix her life. It completes her character arc so perfectly to me. Taiga is the realest nigga throughout the entire show, she starts off as a brat that is way too emotional and very confused, but is honest with how she feels (yknow the whole Table Top Tiger thing) and approaches her life her way. Even though she has been waiting for Ryuji for soooo long, she realizes that just running off and joining Ryuji's family and eloping and all that is hopelessly unrealistic, and at best is still just her avoiding all her life's issues to be with Ryuji. REAL INDEPENDENT WOMAN GETS HER OWN LIFE TOGETHER. By the end of the show Taiga is loved by her entire class, but still knows she has to take care of her own life, and running off with a boy isn't going to fix her family life which is in complete shambles. It's such a anti-romance anime message where it could've just been ""and uhh Ryuji and Taiga live together and go smooch smooch and happily ever after hoooray!"" It's like episode 24 is Taiga and Ryuji indulging in their completely ridiculous teenage fantasy for 24 hours, before coming back to reality and realizing life has to go on in the next episode. Taiga the GOAT put that on god. (Also that Christmas Santa scene has gotta be one of the most heartwarming anime moments I've ever seen awwwwwww :) )
Seems kinda weird to not mention much about Ryuji since he's the main character but I'm tired I just finished this show and it's like 4am. Honestly Ryuji and his mom (ESPECIALLY HIS MOM) get a little snubbed, only in the last 2 episodes do we really get to learn and see different sides of Ryuji's mom and the context of their relationship, which I think is a little dumb considering how core she is to Ryuji's entire character. 
Aside from that my only other criticism would probably just be how melodramatic the show can be at times, which is a silly complaint especially when watching a romance anime, I mean I essentially signed up for this, but still I can't help but roll my eyes hearing Minori go on about ghosts and UFOs for the billionth time when the analogy stopped being clever after the first time it was used.
Overall Toradora! was extremely solid and is the head huncho of romance anime (and is better than clannad you can fight me on that). The characters are the highlights of this show, and the ending drives home a real message to me to be a real nigga at all times, never trading family for a hoe. 9/10, enjoyed it like it's a 10 but still a little too dramatic and confusing sometimes for me to give it a perfect 10. (but who know's I'll probably change the score later.)
On a side note I think it's cool how little fanservice is in Toradora! Ryuji's mom is played as a hottie airhead yeah but the main cast is never unnecessarily showboated, which for a romance anime is pretty impressive. I have no idea if this review is readable or even makes a lick of sense but i had so much fun writing it. Goodnight.",9
"
                [STORY: 8/10]
At first, I wasn't expecting what to get what I got out of this series. It could've been horrid or mediocre, but it came out way above that. I will say near the beginning that it wasn't anything special, as I felt kind of indifferent towards it. The ending is sort of predictable as well but in a good way. The way the story unfolds is the special part, not exactly the outcome for a show such as this. It made me feel for the characters and realize the actual struggle they were going through, even if it seemed like they were happy and
                  cheery at first. I'm satisfied with how it both unfolded and ended beautifully.
[ART: 6/10]
The art for ""Toradora!"" isn't anything to brag about, but its quality is acceptable. A bigger problem arises with the character design, though. The two main characters are pretty distinctive in their looks, but otherwise, the other character designs are just plain lazy. The rest of these characters lack any real significant features that make them stand out among others, besides maybe the trope of exotically colored eyes and hair, so they end up looking bland by anime standards. One of them is even a model, but you really wouldn't be able to tell without everybody acknowledging it so frequently. It's sad because some of these characters deserve better representation, but all they have is a rather generic anime design put into them.
[SOUND: 7/10]
The voice actors are well-suited for their roles and portray their characters well, especially the main cast. Without their all put into it, the intense feelings that drive this show would not be believable.
[CHARACTER: 8/10]
I'll admit, at first, I despised most of the characters in this show for being so unbelievable. I felt like they were just generic filler to push the main romance of the show. I only took a real interest in Taiga and Ryuuji (and Ami later on, as she isn't present from the start) because they felt like they had more than one dimension to them. I'm glad this wasn't the case. As I continued on with the show, I began to realize that these characters were only acting fake and that they had real troubles and self-disturbance inside that they weren't or couldn't show. These are all uncovered as the show progresses and it's very satisfying to see them accept themselves and rip away the persona that plagued their appearance for so long. By the end, it was hard for me to hate any of the main cast that felt so lackluster before.
[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 7/10]
I enjoyed this show more and more as it went on, it made me sympathize with these characters and happy when they had success in finding themselves. The show has its downsides, but overall, I find that they are worth enduring to experience this surprisingly quality show. Romance can be a hit or miss genre, with a lot of shows just copying the general tropes of their adversaries, but ""Toradora!"" abandons a more than satisfactory amount of them, making for one of the best romance stories I've witnessed in quite a while.",7
"
                Have you ever experienced a perfect anime? As an avid anime watcher, I am always looking for these titles, the ones where seemingly everything clicks. Works of such transcendental quality, with impeccable theming and symbolism, that join extremely effective storytelling with gigantic personal and emotional impacts. A piece of fiction without an equal in any media. This review basically is my embarrassing attempt to spread my love for the work, while also trying to prove as flawed, many of the retarded claims made by most of its detractors. Also, contains minor spoilers review, there are things in life that need to be experienced in full
                  glory, without spoilers slightly altering (ruining it is just not possible here) the experience. 
Will start with the technical aspects because good Lord, those sure are spectacular. I am writing about a work mostly done by a single guy, that took years to be finished. Yes, a single team, the genius of J.C.Staff, animated the whole thing, frame by frame while also directing the work and writing the script. The anime is the result of 4 long years of hard arduous work by J.C.Staff, pouring his heart and soul into the script and every frame. Honestly, it just singlehandedly redefined my own definition of an auteur work and of a passion project. It just oozes the dedication, effort, and passion that went into every line, moment, onto every scene. Really the aesthetic it reaches for is something completely different than anything I (or you viewer) has ever seen before. The complete lack of movement, the static mainframes with barely any in-betweens, the really lazy transitions all of which people complained as cost-saving techniques also add a lot to the look and feel of the work. You can just simply be shown any moment in the movie, and you will immediately get something truly wrong is happening (yes, it is that remarkable), which of course adds a lot to the disturbing nature the craft is trying to subtly show. The same can be said about the drab muted color design, bad composition, lazy usage of angles. Many detractors still find reasons to complain about this artistic unique style of aesthetics and directing with the really retarded logic of comparing it with other works, most notably Demon Slayer, another team project made by the legend, Kasai, Kenichi himself. What those idiots apparently cannot figure out is how the gigantic difference, the 10-year gap between both works can create in the animation craft. Nagai, Tatsuyuki when working in anime with disposal the most recent computer animation techniques, which was in fact a technique with little usable skills at the time only being used to fix a little the artwork and actually made the production project slower. Never forget how it is that movie experimentation with newer technologies that made for its godly visual aspects like its legendary usage of depth of field. So yeah, really unfair and totally off-the-mark comparison. This method just in general loses completely the idea of how this work of fiction should be appreciated and judged to Demon Slayer etc: We cannot compare the quality of this anime production by seeing its non-existent qualities in comparison with literally anything you ever watched. No, no, no, you need to look at the effort, the dedication showed by spending years and lots of money just to make this project. It is in recognizing that for someone in these conditions he achieved a really impressive result. Is this concept of just forgetting anything about the quality of the work at hand and just focusing on the artist, his experience, what crazy lengths he must have gone to manage something of this magnitude truly that hard to grasp. Even when limited the animation is used to really great effect here, it just gets how to pass tension and terror so well. It understands how what is shown is never what is really terrifying, a person with a knife trying to kill us, sure, that can be a little scary. But a creature you cannot see, something you cannot understand, an unknown and highly dangerous threat you cannot understand or define, this is way more disturbing. It gets how not showing can be the most effective tool, by always showing everything, the romantic scenes with its top tier animation style, in all its glory, hilariously full of itself. 
But since the production can amount to much else than pretty colors, I will talk about the concepts, the several thematic threads found in the movie. Out of the bat, I have to say this work has a fascinating style of thematic exploration. People who cannot believe how short-term duration fiction can represent broad interesting topics in a thought-provoking manner. It is the exception that proves said though as flawed. An analogy with the way ideas are debated in general, the dialectic can help to explain the brilliance found here. The movie's thesis is really simple, it represents a truly optimistic view of the world and society are the core of this world, having hope for happiness, or the possibility of a better life can only leave you to happiness and exuberance. Toradora presents a fully formed worldview, one that resonates with universal feelings in the hearts of many, the love the heart-warming, the trust of everyone has at least one moment in their lives when they think of the world as a holy place. But of course, nothing in a debate is simply self-provable, its veracity and worth are only given by how it interacts and disproves other ideas. Here comes Toradora’s counter-thesis, which finds its representation in the mentality of the protagonist, her naivety, her hopeful dreams and love and happiness, the belief of those feelings as an important part of life, and that her situation will improve in the future. The anime goes for a really fascinating method to argue for its main thesis, instead of having any arguments for the counter-thesis, showing its positive aspects, how Taiga's view of the world may make sense under a certain perspective. It does want to make your belief in the thesis, by making it ultimately defeat, prove as flawed a strong and well-constructed opposing argument, ultimately making you even unwilling to come to an understanding or even an agreement, with an idea the viewer could otherwise enjoy. No, the geniuses process at work here is really different, it is one that involves proving your thesis, by having most of your world, characters, and events, as just more evidence of what you are trying to say. Having the character sadism and happiness becoming more and more extreme balancing each other out, happening frequently in most scenes, their acts in every way possible of the fairness of this world, the more extreme the act the better, as evidence for your thesis. There is no need for a strong contrast, like showing in detail the calm everyday life that serves as a base for Taiga's way of thinking and actions, which would make both the counter-thesis better supported, and the harmony of the things that happen to her more heart stroked by contrast. But just start with Ryuuji's ominous stare. Really having something really good happening, allowing for different changes in value between scenes other than from good to god’s work, would do a lot to improve this work. Showing with truly great conviction, the truth of what the writers are saying. 
This is the part where I have to admit, Comedy, Romance, and Slice of Life do contain the best cast of characters in the world. Because really the objective quality behind these characters really does not matter. Their function in history is not to have depth, likable traits, motivations, or backgrounds, but to represent perfectly the lovey-dovey stereotypes. Following rules and genre clichés do not represent shortcuts when the author shows the laziness of writing unique personal developments for his history. These constructions and clichés are in fact the end-all of fiction, the author should be looking and trying to replicate exactly those. Between developing characters, situations, and themes which would propel his craft, the piece of fiction he is trying to make, or trying to simply follow genre rules and expectations, it is pretty obvious what should be the creator's priority. So, complaining about the lack of character depth makes completely no sense already, but let's look a little deeper into the characters. With the exception of the protagonists (Taiga, Ryuuji, Minori, Ami, and the sexy beast Yuusaku) they are a group of completely sentient, deities most they show signs of passionate aura and copious amounts of love, really, they make for a fine representation of the nice aspects of mankind this anime is attempting to illustrate. There is another argument for the lacking personality in most characters consisting of a flaw, which is that the focus in showing the unpleasant side of humanity, with no insight or introspection to the people making those acts can only amount to that feeling, unpleasantness (Taiga’s dad). It can never be shocking ‘people saying the violence in here is for shock factor are idiots, there is no way to be shocked with what is being presented’-zachwin1. They do not emerge here because the characters have no personality to react to the cruelty, we cannot see aspects of our personality in them, which would make us at least feel empathy for the people suffering and making others suffer, see aspects of our ourselves and our life's, identifying them as human beings' kind of not so different from us. This would really make us care in a lot of ways for how Taiga’s dad did. It is not this is some really difficult stuff to pull out, just gives the characters a unique perspective and worldview, a personality that can react in a unique way or think differently about the violence. As it is in the best of cases you get a slight feeling of distaste for the events at play, or at the worst you can laugh maniacally at all the comedic times scenes. I truly applaud those that managed the latter half of it. 
When you are dealing with this level of artistry in the making of a show, you can expect it to be noticeable in all of its aspects. Of course, the world-building is no exception, instead of going for lazy exposition and adding countless useless details to a setting, that would otherwise not affect characters' plots or themes, Toradora goes for a more minimalistic route. Sure, we may not know much about this world and city at the end of the day, but every bit an ounce of information adds something in a symbolical or character level, making for really effective storytelling. Just the way they tie the analogy of western dominated audience and the effects of school life with my favorite character, Kitamura, Yuusaku. This is superbly done. His ability the complete dominance it establishes over other characters also shows the state of his mental brain capacity at the period. In one of the show more fantastic surreal sequences of events, an iconic image of effects of Yuusaku bleaching his hair. This kind of symbolical representation can be seen in several aspects of the setting, where the simply generic representation of the hellish school, life, and love life clashes with each other. On the other hand, it is a city filled with joy, love, and really hard to believe in real life by today's standard of living in all the geopolitics that happening between x and y country. It is not a lazy generic portrayal of any place having a disaster, or just difficult social times. No, it actually has a lot of symbolic value, which of course I know of, but will not say here, for simplicity sake. 
So, to conclude if you were looking for a Top tier triple S god-like radiating aura of a masterpiece anime with 10/10 characters, 10/10 dialogue, 10/10 theming, 10/10 plot, 10/10 directing, then please look no further than Toradora. In this review, I simply cleared some surface elements, just skin-deep details that represent a tiny fraction of what Toradora has to offer. There are so many great details I can write about in length here but I need to do this before 10 o’clock so yeah, like the way the effective usage of the soundtrack, like playing music, which of course adds another entire layer to the whole to Toradora. The style of narrative utilizes techniques of Japanese traditional storytelling to achieve new heights by using really interesting, creative ways to tell this narrative. So, would I recommend this? Yes, yes, yes, just do yourself a favour and spend your next hours checking this masterpiece out, I guarantee it will not be like anything you have seen before. 
Score: 10/10",10
"
                I really don't get why this anime is regarded as the best ever in the genre.
I really disliked it from the start because it may only be due to my over analísation of everything I see, but from the intro I could tell then ending that Minorin would like him back but he chooses Taiga because Tsundere funny. I hate tsundere's in general too. But other then the awfull story telling and every character being as liner as the hungarian economy except taiga, the artstyle was great the sound design too.
Now I don't know if it was the source material was what was written in
                  this matter or the adoption ruined the story telling. I jsut think this series had serious potential but it wqas ruined by the problems I talked about.",6
"
                Basically, there's Guys A and B, and Girls 1 and 2. A and B are best friends, and 1 and 2 are best friends. A has a crush on 1, and 2 has a crush on B. Therefore, A teams up with 2 to hook each other up with their best friends. Sounds confusing? Watch the anime and you'll get it.
Let's start with the bad and end with the good. The art was good, but nothing to call home about. There were a few remarkable shots, but the rest was relatively average. But as long as the art isn't painful to look at, it's fine
                  by me.  The sound and music were very good. All of the tracks fit the mood very well, and I love the first opening and both endings. I mean LOVE. First OP is catchy and both the endings hold a lot of meaning. Just look up the lyrics translations.
The characters is where I have more to say. Yu-saku is one of the lamest characters I have ever met. He's as about as deep as the layer of lint in the tray after drying a single bath towel. Ami has an interesting personality with many facets but doesn't quite develop further as a character. Taiga is a perfect example of tsundere, which is cliche as balls but gets the job done (there's a reason it's a classic). Ryuji is similar to Ami since he has a lot of quirks that make him interesting, but he doesn't really develop either. Minori is my favorite character. She has a very distinct, quirky, and upbeat personality. She gets a series of dramatic and philosophical scenes that really drew me to her. The fact that I couldn't exactly pin down what she was thinking was something I enjoyed, since the other characters were so predictable. In the end, however, I can't really say that the characters were bad. While some of them WERE cliche and never fully explored, they were top quality cliche. What I mean by that is they weren't cliche enough to the point that I facepalmed, and it was clear that each character had redeeming qualities that made me actually care about them (except Yu-saku... he sucks).
The story was the best part of the anime, hands down. Throughout watching the anime, I made various predictions on what was going to happen and who was going to end up with who, etc. I thought I knew the cliches. I was actually wrong so many more times that I thought I would be. All of the relationships in Toradora seem to grow very naturally. All of the twists and turns that occur are never outright unbelievable, and some of them are truly heart-wrenching. The pacing of the relationships and romance were almost perfect. Never did I feel bored at any point. I felt emotionally invested in every conflict the characters had. Love is a battlefield, and not everything turns out perfectly, which this anime shows. I said ALMOST perfect for the pacing solely because of the last two episodes. Those who have watched will understand what I mean.
Toradora shows that if you take an anime with decent art, sound, and characters, and put them into an unpredictable, emotionally charged love story, you can raise the score of your anime to a solid 8.
Also Minori best girl",8
"
                Wow. I don't really know where to start. Toradora! was my first anime and I just completed it. There is nothing bad I can say about the anime. When watching the Anime, you start to feel a connection to the characters and when a character in the anime feels bad, you also feel bad for them. The way the anime shows the watcher how the characters feel, is just incredible. Even if you're not sure about watching the anime or just watched the first Episode and don't like it so far, just watch it. I am pretty sure that you'll like it. But get some
                  tissues before watching it! ;)
I can't really say much about the Japanese and English voice acting, as I have only watched the German Dubs so far, but they are AMAZING. Especially Luisa Wietzorek who voiced Taiga in the German Dubs has done an INCREDIBLE job.
EDIT: We NEED a second season. Even if it just has 5 Episodes.",10
"
                Story:  So the story of this is that ryuuji and Taiga end up crossing paths in the school she is the plamtop tiger for how she is in school and such but what ends up happening is that they both love each others friend so they end up teaming up so that they can get each other to hopefully get them to fall for each other (Ryuuji is friends with Yuusaku and Taiga is friends with Minori) so they team up in hoping they Ryuuji and get with Minori and Taiga with Yuusaku but all the while (sorry for the spoiler) that Ryuuji and
                  Taiga might have something going that whole time.
Art: art is really good nothing to complain about the backdrops and the character design is on point even when it came out in 08
Sound: Both Op for the anime i personally didn't care for as for the ED i loved the first one a lot better than the second one they had as for the characters i watched the dub and the dub all i can say was freaking good.
Character: Taiga is one of the females lead and she can be a bit of a bad attitude and also she is known as the Plamtop tiger as i said she goes have a feisty side to her but also a good side to her as well. Ryuuji is one of the male leads well the legit male lead and he is a pretty nice guy a person who loves cleaning and just doing household stuff well but all in all a pretty nice and just cool character. Yuusaku is the last male lead and well he is the vice president of the school honestly he is a pretty chill and pretty nice person nothing else really to say about him honestly. Ami is another female lead and well shes a model and well she kinda has a bratty attitude and also she puts on a act that she is pretty much nice and sweet. Minori is the last female lead of the anime and she is well she is like bat crazy but in a good way but also she does tend to dodge stuff a lot like many of the characters but honestly shes another good character.
Enjoyment: Things that i liked: i freaking loved EVERYTHING about this anime to the comedy to the characters to the bits of drama also to the romance that are here i mean everything gelled so good with this anime its easily a freaking amazing anime. Things that i didn't like: Maybe the Op and the Ed but that is my only complaint that i will give about this anime.
Overall: giving this a 10 for sure this is actually my first ever 10 Ive giving for a anime this anime is just freaking amazing from the the comedy just being straight up funny form the characters just being freaking amazing and also the romance through out the whole show as well being damn good also the bits of drama that you get in this and also just being enjoyable as hell Toradora! is truly a masterpiece.",10
"
                The story is very good.
Well actually the starting is quite funny.
But there is a big twist coming in the end of the story.
It actually shows that in high school every students emotion is not static.
Well liking someone is different from loving someone.The story is all about this.
The characters are good.Well only some of the characters make a impact in the story.
The main characters are very good.Their build up is very up rising episode by episode.
Talking about enjoyment,it is a high school comedy anime.So its natural that you are about to be enjoyed hillariously.
The comedy is very good in this anime.
Overall this is a sweet fun and heart touching anime of 2 individuals having different problems and different personality.
Well if i write more it will become a spoiler.
I hope this review helps you much
But i suggest you watch the anime.",8
"
                Toradora or in english, TigerXDragon is a story that has a lot to do with who likes who and who wants to strangle who. Mainly its a romance/ dramatic anime.
Now how am i going to review this anime without giving you off the ending, even though its so plainly obvious?
Well this anime is about Taiga your normal Tsundere type of girl who has a crush on Yūsaku, who is the best friend of Ryūji. Now Ryuji has, of course, a secret cruch on Minori who is conveniently Taiga's best friend.
At this point, i already knew what was going to happen, but i decided to watch
                  anyway, because a new character forms her way into this tale, Ami.
Ami also has a crush on Ryuji, which kinda makes the plot very mysterious and...wanting more...
But either way I enjoyed the anime, because it had a lot of bittersweet scenes which eased my soul because im an otaku, AND because you started to feel the characters more and more as the story went on. Its plot made you wanting for more, and the randomness of this tale was completely hysterical!
Really, all in all, i give this anime a 9, because it was so damn cute, dramatic and funny at the same time. 
Heres a link for episode 1 guys and girls:

"
                honestly speaking this anime was a master piece and for all you that have not seen it you should go watch it. At first when i saw this anime i didn't take it serious because i didn't seem to like the art style but later on as i progressed and by mistake clicked on an amv i went to start. the anime itself is great and it keeps you wanting to watch the art of it looks different from all those other animes where all the guys look basically like models this one caught me off guard its art may fool you in the start
                  into thinking this looks bad but dont consider the art till you start watching it. it was in my opinion probably one of the best animes i have ever seen and most likely one of the most i will always love. it has the tendancy to shock suprise and cheer your favorite characters. towards the ending you really get a shock and a sense of sadness but you will be so happy after you watch it especially if your like me a sucker for romance animes. its plot has many twist that will make you fall in love with it at the start of the show please do not drop this anime because of the art style its very beautiful and it to me is something i can relate too. well thats all i can say its probably one of my highest scored and it hooked me the most from any other anime.",10
"
                This is my first detailed review so, bear with me.
I watch a lot of Rom-Com and I've yet to stumble upon one as complex as Toradora. The storyline is so deep in some places that you just get overexcited. When I first discovered Toradora, I thought of it as being a dated Rom-Com with trash visuals but my opinion changed once I completed the series.
The comedy does get a bit old in some places but the anime is not to blame for that (considering that it was aired in Fall 2008).
Visuals:
Whenever I think about Toradora's visuals, I always tend to get surprised. The quality of
                  the VFX is really good when compared to other anime of the time. The TV series has way better visuals than the Bento Battle special. Even though, the Bento Battle special is newer when compared to the original TV series.
Plot and Storyline:
The character development is the thing I like the most about the plot of this anime. The way they first developed Taiga and Ryuji's characters and made them prominent throughout the series was outstanding. Side-by-side, they also developed the characters of Minori, Kitamura and later, Ami. When the character development was nearing completion in the TV series, you could start to see the friend group of Taiga, Ryuji, Kitamura, Minori, and Ami starting to form. Another thing I'd like to mention is the personalities of the characters. They gave Taiga, the tsundere personality and Ryuji, the perfectionist to make it interesting. Overall, the story was amazing with all the twists and turns you'd expect from a Rom-Com.
Other Thoughts:
Toradora! isn't one of those over-the-top ideas you get when you're about to sleep. There was a lot of thought put into the story of this anime and I immensely appreciate it. I don't have a grudge against people who hate or have dropped Toradora, I just feel sad for them because they're seriously missing out. The characters were made so, that you could relate to them. By the end of the series, you'd know the backstories of every main character. Bento Battle was a bit of a disappointment because the visuals were really rough and it was an irrelevant side story.
Conclusion:
I liked the anime and its vibe. The comedy was really good and for a 2008 anime, it blew me away. It's a Rom-Com done right, not going to lie. To those who haven't watched it or have dropped it, let me tell you that you're missing out, pal. It has had the honour of being my favourite anime TV series and for a pretty good reason. If you'd ask me for an anime recommendation, I'd first examine which type of anime you're into and if you're into Rom-Com or SoL then I'd recommend Toradora! to you because otherwise, you'd just end up dropping the series after two to three episodes. If you end up liking Toradora, I can understand why.",10
"
                The short:
Toradora! Is an outstanding anime that has brought me to tears, and filled me with such happiness on many occasions. It's a engaging journey of young love that's pure joy to watch unfold with its cast of developed characters. It would be a disservice for you to miss out on this anime. I highly recommend giving Toradora! a shot at stealing your heart and whisking it away into the lives of these characters. 
The long:
I don't rewatch anime by myself very often. Even with some of my other favorite shows, such as Your Lie in April, Anohana, and Kill la Kill. With the time
                  I have, I like to experience as much time as I can give to experiencing new anime that I haven't watched. Times when I have tried, I only get about halfway through. I still love them to death, but I want to see what more is out there.
There is an exception however: it's Toradora! 
I have watched Toradora! three times, with a heavy consideration on a fourth viewing. This anime is one of those experiences for me that I just can't help but enjoy over and over again. Whenever I feel like I need to escape, a pick me up, or a just a good time, I know Toradora! delivers. This show handles the theme of love really well, not just romantically but it's other forms as well. The way this theme is expressed through the characters is beautifully done. I have yet to see another show handle love in such a real way. It's not over dramatic or unrealistic, Toradora! earns its moments. And when they come, it hits you really good. 
That's why I give Toradora! my only perfect 10 to date. Because it understands love, and competently delivers bringing its message across in an engaging and heartfelt way. The characters have complexities in their own right, whilst acting to further develop dramatic tension within the story. Each character has something to say, that add genuine interest to the show. Toaradora! is a perfect example of how to do a romance right. It's what it is, no more no less. it doesn't try to pandering to an audience, or display some fantastic depiction of what love is. It's genuine. The real deal. It made me think about the loved ones in my life. 
That's why I love Toaradora! so much. 
I cannot recommend this show highly enough. Please do yourself a favor and give it a watch, and let it steal your heart as it did mine.
I also recommend watching this dubbed. The actors did a fantastic job portraying the characters. Major props to them.",10
"
                Toradora is a dramatic romcom, with emphasis on the drama and romance. There's a smattering of comedy here and there but it's not as prevalent. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, often a romcom has to make the decision as to whether it will lean more towards romance or comedy.
The plot of Toradora is simple: 2 polar opposite characters team up to help eachother hook up with their crushes, but end up getting romantically tangled as the series progresses. The plot is fairly predictable early on and there isn't a lot of major progression. It's not until the later episodes that things actually start to
                  progress.
(Spoiler alert)
I am inclined to give this romcom bonus points because it resolves things at the end. The protagonist actually does confess his love to Taiga. Often a romcom will have a lot of buildup but never ends up breaking the love triangle which makes the viewer ponder the reason they watched the show. 
How this romcom resolves things leaves much to be desired. The protagonist ultimately makes his choice and breaks the love triangle, then in a strange twist ends up eloping with Taiga after they both tell their parents to go shove it. It's kind of abrupt and frankly felt shoehorned and awkward. I felt bad for Ya-chan, given the way things ended for her.
The character writing is good, for the most part. I especially liked Ami because she isn't afraid to point out the hypocrisy and stupidity of the other characters. She basically is the character that says what the audience is thinking. There are a lot of times where she seems to be the only character with any common sense and emotional maturity. She is constantly pointing out to the protagonist that he's making a mistake and of course he ignores her, because no romcom is complete without a clueless, romantically tone-deaf MC.
The art and animation was fine. There are key scenes (usually action scenes like when the MC is running down the hall with Minori as she confesses her love) where the animation kicks it up a notch and I appreciated that. The music was alright. I'll be honest, I was annoyed by the music but that's just personal preference.
Toradora! is a decent dramatic romcom that suffers from poor plot/character writing here and there but ultimately still manages to entertain. It's not the cream of the crop but I must give credit where credit is due: compared to the average romcom, this anime manages to do many things better.",7
"
                Plot 9/10
The plot was centered around a normal highschool boy, Ryuuji met with it’s partner on the first trimester, Taiga.. and thus the name of the Anime Tora Dora, Tiger X Dragon. But, I’m not going to tear the shit of the anime’s so that readers out there can read my post considered that this is almost spoiler-free.
For starters, both of them only like each other as friend but later on developed into closer relationship which takes 3/4 of the episode in doing so. I’m completely flummoxed at seeing that Taiga was initially has a crushed on Kitamura. I mean.. REALLY?! That guy looks like
                  a total dweeb and loser to me. Why can’t he just go for Ryuuji instead.. I mean he’s like Tadakuni from Daily Lives of Highschool boy.. But, I give her the credit because Kitamura is well-respected by his peer and junior and even got a thing going on with the school’s president.
THANK GOD!! This Anime is one of those that don’t have any near Nude scene where the Characters are shoving their Fun-bags to the watchers.. I mean, it’s really irritates me to watch that kind of anime. 
They give you this kind of sense of following each characters emotion and really make you into shedding tears and feel emptied after watching it.
I really enjoy all the reference and storyline that this Anime’s are throwing at me. Most of the scenes are memorable and represents a very good storyline.
Characters 7/10
The Characters are well developed and each are having unique personality and even the protagonist is having one, being a neat-freak and that’s really nice. Because most of the time when watching this type of genre.. we will be following some naive dude that keeps questioning things on others and act like a fu*king retard all the time.
The characters don’t have the moe-ish annoying as fu*k attitude. Tora Dora! represents it quite lively and in cute manner. Although I have a little bit hatred on Kawashima for acting like a total whore for the whole sequence of the storyline but It was nicely explained at the end of the anime.. But I still guessing who will Minori be paired with..
OST 8/10
IT’S CONTAGIOUS.. IT’S WICKED.. I CAN’T STOP LISTENING INTO IT ESPECIALLY THE ENDING THEME.
Overall
After watching all of the 25 episode’s I don’t think that they will be need more episodes. Although some of the things in that anime especially the last scene are poorly explained at all like where do Ryuuji and Taiga will be heading for the next chapters of their life, it is just a small matters, so it is considered as fine.
The anime is good enough to end it this way.  This anime is one of the best for the Romance’s genre out there. Go watch it if you want.. if you don’t screw you.
Next, I would want to try Clannad, since there are many faggots on the net recommends and claimed that it is far more better than Tora Dora! But I can sure that not a single characters in there that can match with Aisaka.",9
"
                Generic run-of-mill romance anime, with the girl he loves, secret loving him back, tsundere, loving him also.    When is the choice of the hard-working, studious one with ambitions, or the one who treats him like crap on the carpet, which will he choose?
Sadly I thought this anime was crap, for all the lovely little romantic bits at stages, and the stages you see people getting closer together, you have the retarded general screen of clueless guy, which is so overdone it is unreal.   The combination of the three, and his lack of getting close to the girl he initially likes,
                  just stunk, especially when they start on friendly terms.
Between tiger smacking around the MC, it should be obvious who normal people would go for, but in this stupid anime, even in the last episodes we see our MC, tossing and turning over which to try and choose.
The story, echoed scum's wish, was tropey and generic.   It had nothing special about it, so for those who found it the ultimate romance, I guess they will be reporting as beaten husbands or wives in time, or are in a Lifestyle sort of relationship.   The story sucked, enjoyment sucked, overall sucked, art was nothing special, or sound, last two being average.   Most characters are forgettable, and limited backstory on mains, no hopes or dreams for most either, in character development.,",3
"
                Toradora, one of the most popular tsundere anime out there. While it definitely had the tsundere aspects down, there were a couple of things that were out of place. Overall, it was a decent anime!
I personally didn't quite enjoy the anime as much because the situations the characters encounter could have been easily resolved in better ways. Maybe that's just the practical side of me speaking... 
Another aspect of it that was slightly off-putting was the element of drama. The characters could be fine in one instant and be cry intensely in the next. However, if roller coaster dramatic events are your kind of thing,
                  this anime may be for you! 
The character development was also not that prevalent, and the viewers are not given insight to the other characters nearly as much as the main two. 
However, the grand ending was one that could be considered ""bitter-sweet"" and ""romantic"". While I think the twist at the end was unnecessary, and the characters could have definitely gone about it differently, when looking at the greater picture, it is hopeful and has the element of young naiive love. 
I hope you enjoyed this review, and hopefully it was helpful. Thanks for reading!",7

                A really great anime in my opinion, I would strongly recommend watching it. The series effectively takes you on an emotional rollacoaster. One can easily empathize with the characters and enjoy and suffer with them. It also highlights several aspects in life such as the fact that everyone is fighting their own battle and that lying to protect others can end up causing greater harm. (Please excuse me if my review seems too out of place or such, this is my first review on this site.)

                I'm new at this world, y'know, the anime world and this is my first anime to review, well I reviewed another like Konosuba but no more. I will try to give an analysis of the anime and my judgement.
First, we need to know that ""Toradora!"" is. ""Toradora!"" is a serie that talk us about the history of Ryuuji and Taiga. Now, let's deep into the personality of the characters. First, Ryuuji Takasu is a normal student, very kind and independent but his face is creepy. So much so the people thinks he is a bad person, that makes him the protagonist of this anime and
                  light novel. Second, Taiga Aisaka is a girl who studies at the same school as Ryuuji, she's kind in the inside but cruel with stranger people. Before Toradora! We know Ryuuji fell in love with Minori Kushieda, a teen who is very energic and happy and Taiga fell in love with Yusaku Kitamura, an intelligent and kind boy who is Ryuuji's friend. So, imagine the argument or watch this anime. It's your decision.
Now, let's explain the good thing in this anime. The history is brilliant, and that surprises me because Yuyuko Takemiya wrote an incredible novel, with a simple and everyday topic: teens who wants to reach the love of their lifes. It's so simple that ""Toradora!"" created a great empire of merchandise with their characters, can you believe it? Even in 2020 Toradora! is one of the most popular anime either on MyAnimeList or if you start questioning otakus about their favorite anime. The music is another thing, it matches with the situation of the anime, combinig romance and comedy to made us laugh and cry, besides, the development of the characters is giving to the public a history with logic and why the characters have that behavior. 
Tha bad thing in this: Does this anime have bad things? YES. Why? Well, to answer that is a little bit hard but I won't analyse with my judgement. First, the behavior of some characters, of course we know hat in every novel or any literary series there are characters that doesn't change and the problem is with the stupidity of some students from the school, well, maybe you won't think that and you are free to comment why you are in disagree.
For last, ""Toradora!"" is a great anime and you have to watch it, believe me, it's good.",10
"
                Successful franchises focus on either doing things first or doing them better. ""Toradora!"" triumphs in the latter, and deserves its place among the anime canon. It stands out in the glut of high-school romance anime with its tangible characters who have real personalities, and a script written well enough to warrant a re-watch. Whether or not romantic comedy is your genre of choice, I would highly recommend seeing Toradora!
Story [7/10]: As with most high school anime, Toradora revolves around the standard festivals and breaks. However - and this cannot be overstated - these events are written so that they actually help with character/relationship development! 
Pacing
                  [6/10]: Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect of Toradora is its pacing, which is slow but then rushed near the end. Its blossoming romances are subtle and done with finesse, realistic in many ways, but frustrating considering how much more could have been done in 25 episodes.
Art [8/10]: This anime is drawn beautifully. It does not rely on cheap methods such as chibi fighting/arguing or portrait poses, but rather fully animates each scene.
Sound [7/10]: No complaints here; the music was enjoyable, and the opening theme was catchy enough that I didn’t automatically skip it.
Character [8/10]: Toradora does a tremendous job with its two main characters, giving them a wonderful balance of good and bad. They are, in short, about as real as fictional characters can be. Furthermore, the subtle dialogue builds and transforms the show's relationships. Each exchange moves each relationship as much as tears and screams would in other anime.
If the show's other characters (outside of the main two) were given the same treatment, it could have gotten a 10 in this category. Regrettably, they lacked in character development even when there were opportunities aplenty.
Enjoyment [8/10]: Often in romance anime, it feels like the audience is just waiting for the relationship to happen already (especially in high school anime). This is a symptom of weak characters and plot. Toradora has none of this antsy-ness. With all its foibles, it is captivating and fun, a great ride and a highly recommended series!

"
                So, my first review here on MAL.
I happened to watch ToraDora! about one year ago and still nothing even comes close to how much I love this anime - simply spoken it's my absolutely favourite. It's hard to explain why I love it this much, but I'll try.
Story:
In theory, it's not that new - one guy likes a girl who happens to be the best friend of a girl who happens to like the best friend of the guy who likes the girl - sorry, no way to say it less confusing. Ryuuji and Taiga, the folks who like the best friend of each other,
                  form a pack as how to get closer to their crush. Not without complications thogh.
Whilst the story isn't the newest tale around, it's the way it's told that makes it so good. I've read the Manga and the Light Novel available at Baka-Tsuki.org and watched the Anime and I still was captured every ime anew. 
Art:
Well, it's cute and well done - clear lines, fitting colors, nice backgrounds.... It's all there. I know, the way I describe it sounds meh, but it's really good. I just happen to suck at describing or rating art properly.
Sound:
The Seiyuus do a great job. You really get the feeling they don't voice but rather they are their respective character, especially Kugumiya Rie who voices Taiga (so good in fact that Taiga is rated as one of the five Tsundere-wonders). The Seiyuus really get the emotions of the characters through your speakers. I also really do like the openings, I've had a week-long earworm from Pre-Parade, the frist opening after I watched the show the first time. 
Characters:
The strong point of the show. I couldn't really don't like any of the characters, even if I tried to. Stereotypically spoken, the characters would be: Taiga as violent Tsundere, Ryuuji as nice guy, Ami as haughty b*tch, Yusaku as popular guy and Minori as Genki-Girl. But it isn't that way. Each of them, maybe safe for Yusaku, had some troubles in their past. I can't write them down here because I don't wanna spoil those of you who read this, but I never had that much sympathy and understanding for any characters in any anime. 
Enjoyment:
I enjoyed every moment of it. Everything. from Taiga comedically abusing Ryuuji to the show's confessions to the climax to the afterglow. Everything. I never ever had such an urge to continue a show. ToraDora has twenty-four episodes, yet it feels way to short. If it had fifty episodes, I still would enjoy it without even letting the thought ""boring"" cross my mind. This has never happened before. Not while watching Horror, Action) or Ecchi-Harem. And propably it wont ever happen again.
Overall:
Needless to say albeit not clear from this first review of mine, I rated this show ten outta ten. I've seen my fair share of RomComs and Dramas until now, but no other show from these genres quite as touched me or made me laugh as hard as this one. It's the mix between Drama, Romance and Comedy that makes it so awesome. Imho it's better than Clannad Afterstory and Angel Beats put TOGETHER. Not saying these aren't great shows (though AS is stll overrated), but ToraDora bests them both.
Thanks for reading my review.",10
"
                I picked this show up after watching Your Lie in April. If you don't know what that is, 1.) you live under a rock and YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT 2.) it's basically the saddest romantic comedy you will ever watch. So naturally, I needed a lighter anime to watch, and I found myself watching Toradora.
I didn't think that I'd love Toradora as much as I did. The romantic comedy had me laughing, and it definitely made me feel lighter after watching Your Lie in April. I loved the plot, and despite the series being released basically a decade ago, it really reminds me of
                  my life as a high schooler. Feelings were all over the place, everything seemed like a huge mess- yet, the producers pulled it all together to make it an amazing show. I loved the ending as well, but it made me a little sad that they didn't give me more closure (as always).
The character development in this show is impeccable. I loved the characters in the show; all of them were so different in any way, but they all came together as friends and I loved that aspect of it. 
Overall, this is an amazing show and I loved it. It seems like a habit for me to read the manga after watching the anime. So looks like I'll be reading the manga/light novel next. :3",10
"
                The show with the best horrible openings and endings. Just for that alone I'd give 10/10 points.
But honestly, it's a great show. Go watch it if you didn't already.
Story 9/10
I didn't understand much of the last episode because so much happened so fast. I guess they rushed it a little. But other than that it's a great story.
Art 9/10
Really well done, but old. That's the only thing that bothers me altough it's not really a problem.Sound 10/10
The openings and endings are weird but somehow I love them.
Character 10/10
In one episode the smart guy turns to a f*cking psycho. It's a bit too much if you ask me, but that's no reason not to give 10/10 points
Enjoyment 10/10
One of my favorite anime. Rewatched it several times. Can only recommend it to everyone, even if you don't like romance anime.
Overall 10/10",10
"
                Great show, saving grace being story
You like the MCs guaranteed, the others are alright, show feels super slow, like you're floating through, which I suppose is how real life is but still made the show agonizing to watch. I was into the different moments different amounts, I think it's because I watched it at a bad time and should rewatch (plus I watched dub. DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW IN DUB.) The show is just too freakin slow, it was enjoyable yet painful simultaneously.
TL;DR If you have too, too much time to burn and want a good show to make you feel things and you're
                  an adult, toradora is a fantastic watch and I recommend it.",7
"
                i enjoyed this amine very much i would say it is my favorite of all time. It is Dramatic and Romantic i think and its freakin hilarious. When ever i watched it i was so engaged that when the characters laughed i laughed, and when they cried i cried. I really connected with the characters. I cant say that for any other TV show or movie around. And when i wasnt watching it i would always just think about it. The one thing i didnt like was how short it was thats it but i dont think they should make more it would proboly not
                  be as good and ruin a great thing. I dont think that there is or ever will be anything that will knock Toradora off that pedastal of my favorite anime ever.",10
"
                It is a good anime, but I think there is an important point to remember when watching it: it's a really, really teenager series. The characters are complicated, different, and their personalities are well developed, but they are so young, they are childs. Their problems, their concerns, it's so childish. If you have this in mind, then you can maybe bear the series. I think examples are not necessary, because even in episode 1 you can see that Taiga is not a normal girl.
What I think it's a problem is that actual teenagers that watch this will take it as an example and become... Like
                  the characters... Which I think it's a problem.",6
"
                This is my first anime review. I felt that I should write about it. I came in expecting just a funny slice of life, which is what it provided during the first several episodes. The drama though, was unexpected. The tension begins to increase around the 9th episode as we are pulled into knowing truth, little by little, scraping and putting it together. It starts to become frustrating, with one episode you side with one character, while the other you despise them. It became a tug and pull all the way towards the end.
I gave the story a 8. I loved it, but there were
                  parts that could've been cut-down for a more impressionable impact. I gave characters an 8 because there were supporting characters didn't resonate enough for the audience to care about. I gave the sound a 10, because they used it well for the tear jerker moments. 
Overall, it's a 9. It's a good story, the main characters were written well, and I enjoyed my time watching it. That being said, this is a recommended watch for those who enjoy comedy, slice of life, and romance. I've also took away some important life stories, especially about family & maturity. One element that was the pinnacle achievement of this story, is the female MC and her growth throughout the anime.  
Give it a watch.",9
"
                When I watched the first episode, I really hated this anime and dropped it that day. I hated that unbelievable rude Taiga and that guy for saying nothing to her. One day passed and I thought there is nothing to watch so I should give another chance to this since it's pretty popular. After that,  this anime started to take me to a another world and before I realized I finished half of it. My powerful hate was turning to a pleasure slowly. You know there was a saying that if you hated someone at the beginning so much, you will end up really
                  loving equally to that hatred. Guess it was true for tv shows too after all because I finished it in two days, it was truly very good. I'm feeling that I will miss all of this class members...Thanks to the everyone who created this show and read my comment.",8
"
                Story
Toradora! is an anime that I like a lot and is one of the best in my opinion, it was also the reason that got me into the anime industry. What I like about Toradora! is that it allowed its characters to grow up. It's a genuine, nuanced tale about friendship, love and family. And it's pretty much unrivaled by its contemporaries, and only bested by the best of the best. There was sad and happy moments which led me to liking this anime a lot, storyline was very well made too. I like how other characters find the talent and potential in the main
                  character and accepting him slowly as the series progress instead of holding back that image of him being a delinquent. Another thing I like about is that the series changes the atmosphere at the right place and right time, when it's time to be funny, it gets funny and when it's the time to be serious, it gets serious.
Art
The designs and visuals are nice, facial expressions of the characters are well designed too.
Sound
Basically, there's no flaw in this category, voice acting are perfect and I love the soundtrack a lot.
Character
Each character in this series has their specialty and flaw and I like the way they are a lot. Some may be mature while some may be immature but they change as the series progress, reflecting under the genre 'Slice of Life' a lot which was very notable in my opinion.
Enjoyment
I particularly enjoyed every bit of this anime, I couldn't take my eye off the screen as I wanted to watch every single scene thoroughly. Every single episode left me anxiously wanting to watch the next episode so I finished it in a short time and kind of regretted not enjoying it slowly.
Overall, this is an extremely good anime and it's totally worth watching if you like romance and slice of life animes.",10
"
                Highschool is an awkward moment in life for everybody. And so it fits perfectly into the ""Romantic Comedy"" genre. The lives of highschoolers can be put into a plethora of situations to fit the story. This is why most romantic comedy anime are about highschoolers. Sadly, not all romantic comedy anime turn out as hoped. The romantic comedy genre is a great way to touch people, especially when done the right way. But making a good romantic comedy is easier said than done.
Iv'e been disappointed several times before with different romantic comedy anime. Usually it just ends up to a fanservice anime that's trying too
                  hard to make a good ending. I actually gave up on watching romantic comedy for awhile because I knew I wouldn't like it anyway. But I'm glad to have stumbled upon this one. Toradora! gave the impact of a romantic comedy that I was looking for. No strings attached, and no hole left behind. Maybe a couple of bumps though.
Although it's a relatively old anime, I found the story very fresh. The way it progressed was smooth, and it's twists and turns made me wish for more. I can easily say that the story was definately worth the watch alone. I like the way they gave each character his own special story which connected to the main characters. Although some of the other characters besides Ryuji and Taiga didn't stand out much until season 2. 
I was also impressed in the story telling and how they closed the anime. Usually, these kinds of anime make one wish for more. But honestly, this is pretty much the first time the ending satisfied me so much that I couldn't think of any other ending that would fit it best. 
Also, the one thing I hate is a rushed and unsatisfactory ending. I hate it so much that I could stop watching an  anime on the spot if I found hints that the ending would be bad. That's how much I hate poorly made endings.  But that's also how much I love endings which are complete and satisfactory. And Toradora has done just that.
The art on the other hand isn't as great. The animations we're ok and the transitions were good. But the character design wasn't all that awesome. Which is why I found the second season a bit awkward. The way the side characters are drawn just basically show that they were meant to be just side characters. It made it a bit strange for them to have actual important roles. But then again, it could also be considered an advantage.
And finally, the sounds. This is probably the part that I didn't like about Toradora. The music was ok, but the way they just lazily recycled them was not. It made quiet episode endings feel awkward because of the peppy ED. They managed to fix some of that in the second season, but it still wasn't that impressive.
All in all, though. Toradora is a great anime. It's one of those anime that is capable of leaving a significant impact on your life. I recommend it to anybody and everybody who wants to feel that touch of happiness
that only anime can give.",9
"
                i have to admit it, i watched this cuz a friend told me to, and i wasnt like motivated at first, but then, after watching the first episode, damm, this sh** happens all the time, i mean, this anime is very realistic, i found it funny too for... a bunch of reasons and i actually enjoyed the story, it was very good, the art wasn't any bad at all and every time i watched an episode, i heard the opening song, i mean, i loved it! :3, this anime isnt just good, it is a masterpiece! :D 10/10 for toradora , i also didn't wanted
                  it to end :( but anyways, its a very good anime that everyone must see!",10
"
                Love is a vague term, a word or a single sentence cannot completely tell you what it is. Love can be a commitment, It can also be a need, for some it can be a desire, it can also be made as a bond, for some it is independence.The truth is Love is all of this at same time. It is also what stops you from hurting and at the same time it can both cause you to hurt.  It is what unites you to someone and relieves you from the rest. It is an abyss into which you want to fall only to
                  reach its bottom and be blissed by whatever you find. Due to the fact that love is very hard to explain in layman's term, surprisingly this is one of Toradora's forte, being able to explain and show its audience what love really is.
Story: 10/10
The Story is quite predictable in its outcome,but the progression of the story is well made, the romance does not magically appear out of nowhere it shows the bonding of each character, the developments in their relationship and their situation. I gave the story a 10/10 because the story itself does not focus entirely on the major characters, it also gave the side characters the opportunity  to shine and it showed that they had an impact in the development of the major characters.
Art & Sound: 10/10
Most of the time the soundtracks of Romance animes are cheesy(especially in the opening of an episode), but Toradora was surprisingly different, it only showed a preview of what each character is like. The Art is unique too, specifically the design of each person, you are able to tell how each character's attitude is just by looking at him at the same time there was sort of a ""hidden persona"" inside them that unfolds as you watch the series.
Character: 10/10
The anime did an excellent job in each of the characters  personality, no doubt that they will make you love each one of them for their own unique style. What impresses me most is that they even took the time to develop the best fitting personality for the minor characters even he/she appeared only twice in the whole series.
Enjoyment & Overall: 10/10
Despite the story being a bit cliche, its originality along with its amazing soundtrack and character developments will take into an emotional ride. Undeniably nothing can be compared to Toradora's unique style in terms of character development and heartwarming sensation you feel once you have once finished watching it. I am happy to say that this is truly a masterpiece and is without a doubt one of my favorites. 
That concludes my review for this anime if you have any criticism feel free to comment or pm me. Good day and enjoy !!",10
"
                When I started watching it, I thought it was a bit bland, the characters were generic anime archetypes. That opinion persisted through the early episodes and I decided I didn't like it very much.
Then a vid popped up in my Youtube feed talking how about how amazing it was and I decided to give it another go.
Twenty-five episodes later and I'm speechless. Toradaora is an emotional roller coaster without equal, a masterclass in the fragility of the human heart and the complex and murky nature of human relationships and what drives us as people. The characters are incredibly well written and frighteningly believable in their
                  at times confusing, jealous or self destructive motivation and the choices and mistakes they make that characterize the human experience. Every character has a major flaw and the way the anime comes full circle through the growth in it's major characters is amazing. Watching characters that are written imperfect grow and evolve into a state of self awareness and self acceptance was a joy to behold.
To be honest overall Toradora is a masterpiece and I would recommend it to everyone who's searching for a romance-slice of life anime.",10
"
                Toradora is considered by many a great title, but to me it felt unfinished and annoying. I still think it's a must watch, but solely for the purpose of figuring out what anime you like. Because Toradora pushes some things to the limit, while managing to under-deliver on tangent elements.
There isn't much to say about visual and sound other than that they're both good. Toradora has nice art style that still holds up; it's not filled with simplified shots with chibis, etc. 
Now, the story. On paper, the story is pretty good, and, without spoilers, the authors fulfill their promises to the audience. So far
                  everything seems to come together perfectly into an at least 7/10 title.
And then we have the characters. 
I really like Ryuuji, the main protagonist, and I really feel for him. The mental torture that he has to go through as Taiga appears in his life is something I don't wish on any average Japanese student.
Taiga is the actual main protagonist of the show. Though we watch the story from Ryuuji's point of view, it is Taiga's character that develops the most throughout the story. But man do I wish it would develop more. 
Taiga is unbearable even for a tsundere. She comes off at first as just tsundere, but then her character descends into being that person who just can't accept that they are wrong and would rather cut all ties with you than to admit defeat. Put that together with Ryuuji (as the show often does), a good, straight-forward guy that gets things done, and Taiga's character looks even worse. 
You can tell that the writer really, really tries to set this up right. We are shown why she acts that way, we are shown what really had happened in Taiga's life before the story starts, and it all makes sense, but. It lacks that confirmation from Taiga, that she was wrong, and that she is ready to move on. And that ambiguity makes everything shown prior almost pointless.",5
"
                Wow. I genuinely did not expect this series to be as hard-hitting as it actually was.
This series piqued my interest whenever I saw that people hyped up Taiga Aisaka to be the ""queen of tsundere,"" and I figure I could knock it out of the way pretty fast, so I definitely had to check it out.
Within the first couple episodes, I figured that this was going to be some goofy, harem-esque, slice-of-life romance. Sure, I expected there to be points where the plotline gets serious, as is common in romance anime, however, I couldn't have predicted how impactful Toradora's story is.
We're introduced to Taiga and
                  Ryuuji becoming best friends and through a mistake and both trying to help each other get closer to the person they like. Taiga's tsundere archetype is incredible in this series and provides for both some gutbustingly hilarious and heartwarming moments. The introduction of Ami seemed to be a great inclusion into the series. I absolutely love Taiga and Ryuuji's friendship, as it seems they couldn't even be anymore different from one another. Ami, while not my favorite character, is a great foil character and gives the audience moments conflict. Minori is an absolutely lovable and care-free character who I cannot get enough of. Yusaku, while not really doing as much as the other four in my opinion, is also a good character to have. There are many other supporting roles that are amazing, however, I'd just like to focus on the main five.
The main draw of this anime, which is not on the surface for when you gain interest of this series or first start watching it, is undoubtedly the character development between the main five. Yusaku and Minori seem to deteriorate personality-wise and show vulnerability, making for some emotionally captivating moments, especially for Minori. Taiga, Ryuuji and Ami are all incredible dynamic characters and show character growth, as well as Taiga being a double-edged sword and showing numerous personal insecurities as the series dwindles down. 
(SLIGHT SPOILERS)
While Taiga is already a lovable character from the start, everything after episode sixteen, in terms of how she is as a protagonist, just gets even better and more memorable for me, and I feel that only increases more after episode nineteen up until the ending. While some of this series can be predictable or even conventional, there still are moments that completely hit me unknowingly, especially with what scarily happens at the end of episode 21. I never would have predicted that ending either and I'm relieved we got closure with Taiga returning after the credits, because although the ending was an incredible way to wrap up the series, I would have felt a little broken if the series ended the way it did before the credits.
The art style and scores, while I was iffy on at first, I grew to really enjoy by the end. I get that my review is kind of vague, however, I really don't want to spoil this series for anyone. I think that if you're contemplating whether or not to pick Toradora up, you definitely should check it out. While I haven't seen a staggering amount of anime, I've seen enough to confidently say that I think Taiga has my favorite character development of any series I've watched, period. Even my favorite character, Azusa Nakano from K-ON!, doesn't have nearly the amount of progression as Taiga does. Things become full circle for her at the very end of the series after she realizes what she needs in life and how she needs to be independent thanks to Ryuuji.
I do give a lot of high scores on my account, however, I don't like to throw out tens unless I think something is absolutely worth it. Toradora was an amazing anime, and slides in my number three spot, just below Your Lie in April and above Clannad: After Story. Taiga is now my second favorite character of all time and there was never a dull moment for me while binging this. Without a doubt, Toradora was a ten for me in terms of overall rating. Please do not pass this up if you're considering this series.",10

                I have never watched a series that has made me forget what it was actually supposed to be about for 95% of the time I was watching it until I watched this anime. Toradora! was a stellar anime that I'm going to come back to over and over because I loved the feeling of watching it, but I can't deny that I had an up-and-down relationship with it while I watched it. To try and summarize this without spoilers is going to be tricky, but let's give it a go.
My problem with this Toradora! was that it felt oddly disjointed, especially near the end. Of
                  course, because this is a drama, it wasn't always like that--there were certainly many times that the tone or the story was consistent, and it isn't as though the disjointed material was all bad. Where my enjoyment of the series dipped, though, was when it felt like dramatic scenes were being thrown in for no reason other than the drama itself and when plot developments were entirely unexplained. The first reason is pretty self-explanatory, but the second is one I want to highlight. Yes, some series can pull off a story where the inferences made by the audience are just as much a part of the plot as the overt plot is. However, Toradora! didn't successfully do that, in my opinion. Instead, there were character developments/storylines, plot points, and emotional developments that felt, either, out of nowhere or extremely confusing for lack of supporting context. 
That complaint goes hand-in-hand with my disappointment with how the supposed main storyline was handled--not only was Takasu, one of the main characters, not really developed beyond his romantic storyline, but the main storyline itself wasn't even really subplot until the very, very end. Now, I do want to mention here that the characters' relationships and the other pieces of the plot were enough to keep me entertained the entire time--I didn't even notice the main plot hadn't been touched until I realized I was almost finished with the series, which is an obvious indicator that Toradora! had plenty to stand on besides the main plot--but in retrospect, I was left wanting in that regard. I'd say that kind of sums up why Toradora! wasn't a masterpiece to me: it didn't quite fulfill the expectations it seemed to set up for itself in the beginning.
Now, the only reason I was able to go on for so long about negatives is because I did love this anime a whole lot. Though there were many areas where the emotion became a bit too cheesy or extreme, I was very impressed with how these characters' personalities and struggles were explored throughout this series. A lot of the time, there are very clear parallels between the specific issues these characters are going through and the more general issues of real people--in that regard, Toradora! conveys a lot of important messages to its audience about seeking happiness and a sense of self in a clever way.
Without getting too existential, I also felt like the characters on their own, minus the messy, real-world analyses of their lives, were mostly interesting and fleshed out in the necessary ways. Now, like I said Takasu wasn't explored all that much for a main character, and actually, I feel like some of the other characters got a bit too much focus--it felt like the balance was off sometimes--but at the end of the day, the parts of these characters that were shown off through the storytelling all gave very clear pictures of who they were and how what they were going through changed them. Despite those developments not always being the best, Toradora! still succeeded in creating the proper stage for these characters to change.
As far as the story of Toradora! goes, I suppose how good it is depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for an anime about a group of friends who fight and have fun and get hurt and love each other, Toradora! has a great story. There are so many relationship dynamics in Toradora! that are entertaining and interesting to watch and think about. If you're hoping Toradora! is going to be a super linear romance story that only serves the purpose of moving Taiga and Takasu from friends to lovers, this story isn't going to do that for you. There definitely are moments peppered throughout the season that remind the viewer of what this anime is, but it isn't about being super overt all the time. Which, to be fair, meant that there was a lot of time for the characters to be proper, individualized characters instead of characters that were only interesting because of who they were in love with. That might not be what you're looking for in a romance--and like I said, I wasn't all that pleased with it, either--but I still enjoyed that the characters had space to all be interesting in their own right.
I do love this anime a lot. I'll be able to go back to it, knowing how it chooses to tell its story, and enjoy it for what it is. The things I mentioned are all very small observations in the grand scheme of the entire season, so I think that the general consensus about Toradora! is that it's absolutely worth watching. Even if it hadn't been a romance--even though the romance wasn't presented the way I would have liked it to be--it's still worth the watch to see how these characters come to care about and support each other. I look forward to going back to this and seeing all the little pieces I missed and maybe cracking a few of the vague plot points I didn't have the ability to crack before. Hopefully you'll find this anime as intriguing as I did.",9
"
                TL'DR: Toradora has it's flaws, but it makes up for it with wonderful characters. It sets itself apart from other shows of the genre, providing a unique, fun and sweet ride that is absolutely worth your time.
12 Years since it's airing, Toradora is still considered to be one of the best Romance anime of all time and there are plenty of Reasons for that.
Story: Toradora features a rather basic plot, simply it's the romantic story of Taiga and Ryuuji but it's thanks to this lackluster plot that the show is able to focus on it's characters. Toradora is at it's best when showcasing its characters
                  and their interactions. By the 4th episode we are introduced to the main cast who seem to just be character tropes given names, it seems unappealing but the show beautifully unravels these characters (even the gag characters are given a moment to shine) through it's 25 episode run ending it's run with a fantastic set of characters who truly differentiate themselves from other Romance shows.
Music and Voice acting: Both Pre-Parade! and 'silky heart' are catchy Opening themes that quickly set the tone for their cour, the Ending Themes are enjoyable but nothing too special, similarly the rest of the OST is also nothing special. Kugimiya does an excellent job playing Aisaka and the other Voice Actors do quite well in their roles but nothing quite memorable.
Weak Points: Despite getting a mini arc, Yuusaku, unlike the other characters, does not develop much and remains more or less the same. Minorin can be irritating at times, the comedy feels weak with Aisaka hitting Ryuuji and calling him a dog making the brunt of it and their relationship progresses a little too fast from Sibling-like to lovers in the second cour.",8
"
                This anime... oh my goodness. This anime is my all time favorite anime. You may ask: Nefer you give everything a 10/10 so why should we trust your review on Toradora? This anime i truly say with all my heart is a masterpiece of animation coupled with tons of emotion and heartfelt love. I will explain.
I will talk about what matters the most in an anime to me personally: Story, Characters, and Sound.
Story: 10
Toradora! has a very simple premise with the main character Ryuuji being a high school student who everyone is scared of due to his eyes (Almost everyone is intimidated by him) He
                  has a crush on a girl, Minori who is very outgoing and loud. Minori's best friend is Taiga, whom like Ryuuji everyone including the teachers are frightened of due to her aggressive nature. I won't go any further so i don't spoil the story. The story may seem as if it is cliche at first and to many anime elitists it is. But the story grows much deeper and stronger and becomes one of the greatest love stories ever shown in the history of anime.
Characters: 10
The characters in Toradora! are what truly sets it apart in my eyes from every other romantic comedy anime out there. Throughout the story the characters develop and evolve so much that while they still may keep their quirks and qualities, they are in a way completely different characters who have learned from their mistakes and mishaps and become stronger. While all the characters develop throughout the anime some develop more notably then others. Kawashima Ami for instance has absolutely amazing development throughout the anime as she goes through the hardships of being famous and popular. My absolute favorite character of the series has to be Aisaka Taiga. Yes she may be a Tsundere but for the love of god she is the Queen of the Tsundere's. Everything about her, the character design, her hair, her eyes, her personality, her height, etc. (If you look at my profile you will understand how much i love Taiga)
Sound: 10
One thing i find absolutely necessary in an anime is to have a good soundtrack. Toradora! delivers in that field n every aspect. The music combined with some of the more somber scenes made me tear up and cry on multiple occasions, and when need be the soundtrack completely cuts off to make romantic scenes even more so. The music direction in Toradora! is absolutely stunning.
Overall: 10
As i stated earlier Toradora! is an outstanding anime, and in my opinion is one of the best anime ever. It has one of the most memorable cast of characters a romcom has ever delivered and will provide you with many great laughs, as well as make you cry. About the only thing i could say bad about Toradora! is the ending (which i will NOT spoil) as i feel like it was out of left field and i wish they would make a OVA or even a movie to tie it up. This anime made me appreciate that i have someone in my life. and when i struggled with my relationship i always think about Toradora! I wholeheartedly reccomend this anime to anyone with a heart and soul and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did.",10
"
                This review contains minor spoilers, but does not touch on any major plot points. Regardless, read at your own discretion. I rate shows a little differently - I group sound and art into a quality score, which only affects a show's overall rating if the quality is particularly good or bad.
Toradora is a cute romantic, slice-of-life comedy with a good bit of drama sprinkled throughout. The story follows Taiga, the petite tsundere, and Ryuuji, the kindhearted and friendly boy with the face of a delinquent. Despite its popularity and position as one of the most popular anime on MAL, Toradora isn't just a generic romance
                  - there's a lot of depth and characterization that makes it stand out from the crowd. However, does it capitalize on its unique premise? Let's see.
Story (6/10) - Toradora's biggest flaw does in fact come from its premise, which is a shame, because the premise is so captivating for a majority of the show. The show's pacing seems to falter in the second half, and you're left with out-of-character changes that just don't seem to make sense. Furthermore, the ending leaves a lot to be desired, and feels so poorly constructed after the buildup you receive from the majority of the show. It's hard to explain more without spoilers, but poor pacing and a disappointing, poorly executed ending mar the creative storytelling of Toradora. Overall, I would say the story is decent regardless and it deserves credit for telling a unique romantic tale - it just didn't fully capitalize on it like it could have.
Characters (8/10) - Toradora's characters are likable, dynamic, and receive a lot of development. Sounds like a recipe for success, right? Well, mostly. Taiga and Ryuuji are stellar - you learn so much about their lives, their motivations, and their true personalities. They make a great duo that's fun to watch and fun to follow. Despite being *the* ""textbook tsundere"", there's a lot more to Taiga than what you initially see. Toradora's other main (?) cast members are quite good as well, but I have a few gripes involving some of them. Both Kusheida and Kitamura (Ryuuji and Taiga's crushes, respectively) have character development arcs that seems really out of place and out of character. Of course these developments are explained, but personally they still didn't feel like they fit. Despite this, the main cast is easy to follow, receives adequate development, and pleasant to watch. You can't ask for much more than that.
Enjoyment (8/10) - The thing that surprised me most about Toradora is that it's actually a really fun watch, despite the more relaxed genre typing. Slice of life is a genre that is very hard to master - making a show that's both focused on real, everyday events yet intrigues and interests the viewer is no easy feat. Toradora, however, pulls this off quite well. There's enough going on that it really pulls you into the love square between Taiga, Ryuuji, Kusheida, and Kitamura. Toradora is charming when it needs to be. It's funny when it needs to be. It's dramatic when it needs to be. Toradora doesn't let the fact that it's slice of life hold it back from being an enjoyable and fun show.
Quality (==) - There's not much to say here. Toradora isn't ugly. It isn't amazingly stunning, either. Both the art and sound are fine, and on par. I don't think they add or detract from the viewing experience.
Overall (7/10) - In the end, Toradora does exactly what it sets out to be - it's a charming and unique romcom with a likeable cast. Does it excel? No. Does it fail? No. Toradora has its flaws and suffers time to time from mediocre writing decisions, but it's still an enjoyable and intriguing romantic journey. If you enjoy romance, then you'll probably enjoy Toradora.",7
"
                After finishing a certain series, I was left with a blank space in my brain, I looked for something similar, very much for the same idea, execution and themes.
I found myself looking through various lists, not being able to find anything very much like it, I skipped various series after trying them on after a couple of episodes.
And then I found Toradora.
Show completely different to what I was looking for, show where the only noticeable similarity was the Romance, something that I did not even look for too much. But I saw the high ratings, I saw the artstyle, and I was intrigued, the show
                  sounds like a classic love triangle but oh boy.
It is so much more.
Toradora provides an experience unlike anything else, it will take you on a journey, a rollercoaster. You'll laugh, cry and even cringe sometimes but every second will be entertaining, every second will be filled with absolute joy: watching these brilliantly written characters interact is such a fun, unforgettable experience. All of these characters have their own motivations and layers to them, you will root for some but you may find yourself second guessing, you will share the experiences, the confusion and the feelings that the characters are put through, leaving a mark on you with every little interaction.
The story is something done incredibly well, it's paced beautifully, to the point where the relationship feels much like a real ones would do - with the sudden ups and downs and long stretches of unchanged emotions. It is also crafted in such a way that you will not want to put it down, your eyes glued to the screen you'll be charmed by the various adventures and later emotionally charged moments.
All I really have to say that no matter what you're looking for, even if Romance isn't your usual style. Try Toradora, not because of the ratings not because of the art but because it is genuinely one of the most heart throbbing, meaningful shows that you will have the pleasure of watching.",10
"
                This anime made it very hard to find another anime after I was done with it to watch because I wanted to enjoy the next as much as I did this one. Taiga is such a lovable character and I can honestly say that she reminded my friends of me (Course I'm not as rowdy). The story progressed nicely but I do remember feeling a bit rushed towards the end. I wanted it to continue and go more in depth in the plot. 
Over all it was a very good anime and I was sad when I came to the last episode. I would love
                  to have more anime made like this one!",10
"
                  Toradora presents a unique take on a narrow subject matter overly present in modern anime.  While stories like Clannad and Kanon have proved that school romance animes can be both successful and highly regarded in the world of anime, the amount of repetitiveness has made me wonder if the school romance anime sub-genre is being beaten like a dead horse. Surprisingly, Toradora has managed to break the said notion.
   Toradora! Presents a likeable cast and a modern outlook of japanese culture that are both top-notch.  The voice acting is superb, and the story is laid out in a way
                  that is both engrossing and simplistic.  Fortunately, the romance in the anime is presented in a non-stereotypical fashion, meaning it doesn't lean on the shojo melodrama that is so present in many contemporary romance animes.  The romance, while raw and dramatic at times, asserts a comedic and light-hearted tone that is easy to swallow. The anime is simplistic in story, but amazing in its story-telling.  I highly recommend giving this anime a try.",10
"
                I watched Toradora! at the beginning of me being a anime lover. This Anime was awesome. believe or not i cried in some episodes. The Love Story was heart touchable.  The chemistry between them was also enjoyable. Taiga was cute and Takasu was unique. Because of that there combination was perfect. I loved this anime because of the sudden turns of events. This Anime has 24 episodes and i enjoyed most of them. 
-The story stays away from cliches and was relatively unpredictable for a love story. Every character had a reason and motive for what they did and how they acted, other than
                  just being unnaturally dumb/too prideful/stubborn.
-The soundtrack was really good, making certain scenes all the more memorable
-I loved the comedic scenarios in the beginning of the series, which gets progressively more serious and emotional as we get deeper into the story and characters, but the overall vibe of the show stays relatively consistent to the end
-I became emotionally invested in the overall plot and characters and couldn't stop watching, which is extremely rare for me, especially for this genre
Overall:10/10
 watched the 1st episode and was interested. After the 2nd ep, I was hooked. I watched all 25 episodes in one go, back to back, because I couldn't stop. Never has another series been able to keep me going (I usually don't watch more than 5 episodes in one sitting), but Toradora kept me wanting to click on the next episode each time until I was finished, and left wanting more (even though I was satisfied with the ending)
Afterwards, I thought a lot about why an anime series of a genre that is usually not my taste could have been able to retain my attention for so long, and i realized the answers: the characters and the overall story.
The characters are what make this series so great. Each character have personalities that are unique and rather realistic and believable (or as realistic as animes go). There is no ""super"" character that acts too good or too cool for school. There is no ""that annoying"" character that acts too snobby or stuck up, which can sometimes be a problem for tsundere characters. And this is all because every character shows a weak side or moments of insecurity, which makes each of them more relatable. It also allows for many rather comedic scenes as well as emotional moments. But the best part is the interactions and chemistry between all the characters, and the way each of them change as their relationship with each other grows.
The second thing is the story. The reason I usually don't care for romance or drama is because I usually find the story too cliche or predictable. I also hate those cliche moments of ""coincidence"", for example, when a main character happens to see his/her love interest with someone else accidentally and misunderstands. I also hate it when characters act unnaturally stupid or too prideful for no reason and let it get in the way of the relationship. 
But none of those cliche moments happen in Toradora. Every character has a reason and motive for the actions they decide to take. The story managed to keep me guessing and wanting to know what will happen next, instead of making me feel like i could write the story myself.
Another plus for Toradora is the music. There are some key scenes where the soundtrack actually triggered goosebumps and made me tear; it still does even after rewatching. THAT IS RARE FOR ME. In fact i don't think anything I've ever watched, not just anime, can even make me feel that emotionally invested in fictional characters.
Again, Toradora has become my favorite anime, as a guy that usually doesn't care for this genre, which says a lot. It gave me more enjoyment than any of the other anime I have seen so far. I would recommend it to anyone, not just romance lovers.",9
"
                I didn't think I would enjoy this series when my friend described it to me, but I was pretty much hooked after the one episode he showed me! 
Every character is unique and they all work well with each other and the story. They range from normal to completely over-the-top, which is a huge contrast I enjoyed.
The story is the perfect balance between laugh-out-loud silliness and excellent character drama. Toradora! had me in tears laughing at the funny characters and the even funnier situations they were put in, but it also had me tear up at some huge moments of vulnerability most of the characters
                  showed, especially later in the series.
The momentum of the series wanes a bit in the last few episodes, to the point where it feels like the show is moving in a different direction, but it doesn't affect the series overall, in my opinion.",9
"
                No Spoilers
Toradora! Is an anime I have watched and re-watched. J.C. Staff presents us with the story in a set of 25 episodes. The story follows a selection of characters led by a male and female lead as the main two. They are accompanied by a handful of secondary characters, and of course a school full of background characters.This Slice of Life Romcom sets the standard for the genre. 
When approaching the visual aspect of Toradora! it's really a case of just right. This doesn't leap out as a beautiful and stunning piece of animation, but it doesn't leap out as poorly animated either. It's
                  the perfect fit for the show, letting the light feel not overshadow the much more important aspect of what Toradora! is out to deliver. The OP and credits are very well done. The best visual aspect is focused on the characters. For the sake of length I'll only briefly touch in the two biggest MCs. Note however all the characters had well done styles and looks. The lead male is modeled as a taller bad boy. Narrow eyes and a basic hairstyle keep it from being too complicated. The lead female is very petite without appearing fragile. These become iconic designs in having MCs appear original, without being boring. They use this design for the MCs to play the “don't judge a book by it's cover” card.
Moving into the sound track, Toradora! has 2 opening and ending themes. I'll cover way there are 2 later on. All four are great pieces that go well with the visuals. The second ending theme I found to be especially memorable. The in episode soundtrack is excellent as well. There are several big moments in the show where some original pieces accompany the scene and do a lot to boost the moment. Musically the anime is able to show a great variety of songs for the different messages being presented.
What makes Toradora! such an incredible experience is it's plot. Unlike some other greats it's not an artistic combination of visuals and sound along with story. Toradora! could be read with no visuals and still be a novel worth reading. There is no fantasy world of magic or sci-fi spaceship that other top anime's bring to the table. What's strange is just how common the settings are. Toradora! appears to follow the ultimate Romcom cliche of high-school with all the regular festivities and journeys. Instead of falling short l, Toradora! needs a basic format to sit on to avoid taking away from the characters. Each character is highly developed and fleshed out. The characters each at first seem to fit the basic anime tropes, but without being to over the top. Unlike anime's like Itzura Kiss (which I liked) the characters actions can be explained. Each character shows moments of weaknesses displayed, and solo moments to help relate to. Everything each character does is understood. The interesting thing about Toradora! is the “changing of the guard”. The show is much more a comedy in the beginning, and transitions into more of a drama. The comedy Toradora! brings has fresh new skits that play in tropes we are all familiar with, but executed perfectly. As the show continues to deliver laughs it's easy to settle in and see Toradora! as a light-hearted relaxing show. However without any sudden leap, the show becomes more serious. All of the hi-jinks slowly help the audience grow attached to the cast and it's like a tap being turned on slowly. By the time the Christmas cliche episode arrives, the audience is suddenly shaken with the realization that it's been sneaking up on them. Toradora! then plays out what should be recognized as the best overall rise and climax for romcoms. Toradora! runs it's second half at a quicker pace than the first, adding to the intensity of the developing plot. Toradora! is satisfying. It goes all over the map taking on wild ideas towards the end before delivering exactly what everyone wanted.
Toradora! stands as a 10. I'm writing this review after seeing it twice, with a large time gap, and having considerable time to change my opinion. While Toradora! doesn't have me yelling at the screen or ugly crying, it delivers an amount of laughs, emotions, and ideas that is just right. It's the Goldilocks of Romcoms. 
What is most important to me about Toradora!, and a variety of other viewers, is it's ability to change the watchlist of it's audience. For viewers with a focus on action or sci-fi, Toradora! becomes the gateway anime. The Romcom premise and character designs bait in these viewers. For viewers with little or no romance or drama anime experience, Toradora! is a gentle fall into a deep ocean. Toradora! sets the bar in it's genre, and can be enjoyed by anyone.",10
"
                This review based on my own experience.
Another great rom-com that's worth watching. Funny in the beginning, quite wistful in the end. But of course, it's not a bad/sad ending. I really like the plot from this anime. The relationship development between MC and the heroine made this anime is amazing. I can feel each character from this show. All characters contributed to making the story is meaningful
For Taiga, as a tsundere, she can bring the nuance of the story brighter and funnier. I love seeing her especially when she's blushing.
For Ryuuji, even he is a hygiene and neatness maniac, he has a good manner and
                  very kind. I really appreciate his patience while he is with Taiga. I must admit, they both are really perfect to be a couple and successfully attract me as an audience.
Even I'm 12 years late to watch this, this anime is still getting TOP 20 for the most popular anime on MAL. For an anime at that time, this anime was the greatest, especially for the romance-comedy category.",9
"
                Toradora! has to be one of my favorite animes. The thing that is so enjoyable about the anime is how well written the characters are. I feel that Taiga and Ryuuji are believable characters, as well as the more minor characters. The writing balances comedy and drama very naturally. The dramatic parts really pull you in as well. It's not an anime where you will just passively watch characters fall in love. The excellent writing gets you to feel for them. The more you watch, the more you get sucked in to the storyline! If you like high school romance stories, you will fall in
                  love with Toradora!",10
"
                I would describe this anime as a jelly filled doughnut, first few episodes were a bit dry, but the more I bit off, the better it got, until there was none left.
I enjoyed the whole in-depth look on ''thinking about others more then yourself'' and how it can effect relationships, for me it felt like the main ''thing'' that the show was focusing on.
On the romance aspect, it wasn't bad, but nothing to gawk over, definitely had its moments, but for me it felt like it was focusing more on the overall relationship between the main characters.
Also, I absolutely LOVED the character development through out
                  the story, it was definitely something unique, felt like the characters actually matured.",9
"
                This anime leaves me torn. 
On the one hand I really adored the art and the soundtrack (especially the first opening song). I binge-watched the first 10 episodes and really enjoyed the premise. You fell like the two main characters are a perfect match. I also liked the characters, most of all Ami, the comedy and the drama, especially episode 19.
But on the other the hand is the story... for crying out loud... The development of the story is really slow and the worst part is the ending (meaning the last 4 episodes). In the middle of the season practically nothing important happens except for
                  the mandatory slice of life school festival and then they rush towards the end which leaves so many questions open.
It‘s an enjoyable anime with a really promising premise but kinda loses it towards the end.",7
"
                I was fairly surprised by this show. I was quite enjoying it when I began watching it. Then around a few episodes, it kinda pissed me off for some reasons I will detail later, so much so that I almost dropped the watching. And then, again a few episodes later, I suddenly thought ""oh, my God! This show is actually... clever!""
So yeah, I think this show is clever. Sometimes. And that is what I liked most in it.
I will try to go a bit further into details.
I think this show is clever for several reasons. The first reason may be the characters. I would not
                  go so far as to say that they are novel or unique. But they certainly each have their own personality that is clearly defined and constant throughout the show. More interesting in my opinion is the relationship between the characters. If the characters are each well thought out, it is the way they come into interaction with each other that is the most interesting part. I just believed that their behavior certainly did not look like that of high schoolers, which they're supposed to be.
The second reason would be because it has something to teach about love and romantic relationships. It is for me the most important.
Most romcom and slice of life shows tend to merely tell a love story, this one tells a story about love itself. It is one of my great disappointments in life that there is no education of love and romantic relationships. I am not talking about sexual education but really about love education: what it means, how it is important and what would be a good way to build an intimate relationship with someone, by opposition of a bad way to do it. These are things you have to learn on your own, with the lot of mistakes it implies.
The point is: I am always very gladly surprised when a show seems to have the ambition to teach something about love, something it took time for me to understand. And Toradora! is one of these shows.
I cannot go too far into details here without spoiling some part of the story but I particularly remember when a female character was trying to convince a male character that idolizing your love interest was not a good way to lead to a good relationship (and that he would be so better off actually going out with her, but that is another story).
The third reason is because what it has to tell, it tells it sometimes exceptionally well.
I will just give an example which I think is not too much of a spoiler. At some point, there is a male character that is drastically changing. And one of his friends is really depressed by the fact that she cannot understand him, and therefore cannot help him; although she really thought that they were good friends and she knew him. And then, as she is walking in the night, she sees the Orion belt - that is to say three stars perfectly aligned in the Orion constellation. And she figures that these stars, although they appear to us really close, are actually far far away from each other. She then concludes that everything is not as it appears and she wonders if it is the same with her friend: could it be that she and he, although they appear close, are really far appart?
And God, this is clever!!
The cleverness of this show really came to me as a surprise because my first impression of it was not great; and it is far from being a perfect show.
My main problem at the beginning of the show was the character of Taiga.
She is a loli.
She is a Tsundere.
Which is just too bad cause I happen to hate both tropes.
In all fairness I have to admit that I liked in the characters of Taiga and Ryuuji the fact that cliches about boys and girls were reversed: the boy enjoys cooking and cleaning while the girl is bold and consistently brawling. That is a nice feature.
Another disappointment in this show for me is the ending. Once again I will try not to spoil anything, but the show basically ends up with two characters going out with each other. Unfortunately this conclusion felt rushed for me. At this point of the show, one of the two characters is pretty sure of their feelings while the other is uncertain for they also nurture similar feelings for another character. And the reasons why they get to choose one over the other are greatly unsatisfactory for me.
So here you go: the show was definitely enjoyable, it had been a long time since I had not been looking forward to go back home everyday to watch the next episodes, and the show was very clever on some parts, but it was also the object of numerous disappointments which prevented its being actually a great show.",7
"
                Toradora was really good anime. It had many good laughs and some good moments from the characters
Art 8/10- Its an anime created in 2008 so it is was simple but I don't think weren't much poor quality though out the show keeping constant look though it all
Sound 7/10- I've watched Toradora though the dub and I think they did well when it came to following the mouths of each charter and the show sounded quite clear
Character 8/10- Each character had there own traits which quite suit them and even one or two background characters would also show which actually made the show a lot funnier.
                  The show shows a lot of appearance vs reality so some charters might be perfect in the insides but in reality, they live the worse life inside them (not implying that there's a character that has that in this show) 
Story 7/10- [Spoilers] I think the story was ok, it had the elements of romance, comedy though out it all though. The story was about though two classmates trying to help each to get the person they love but end up loving each other and then getting married which at first might sounds odd on how that happened but its does slowly show how they fall for each other which was well thought out.
Enjoyment 9/10- For me, I think I like comedy the most over romance which there was a lot in this show which made me laugh though out but I do like the some of the romance that takes place in the show which gives a solid 9
Overall 8/10- So I think that this anime was really good, I like some of the characters, and the story was ok, and I would recommend this to someone who has started watching anime or someone who is looking for laughs",8
"
                I imagine that I'm fairly late to the party, what with reviewing an anime from 2008 all the way at the tail end of 2015. Also given that this show currently sits at #12 on the Most Popular Anime list, odds are most people that have had a great desire to watch this show have already seen it. But, that's not what a review is for, is it? So for those that are idly browsing the review section looking for a new show to enjoy over the weekend, allow me to share some of my thoughts on Toradora.
At a glance: Toradora is a rare piece
                  of slice-of-life anime. What strikes me most is its incredible ability to get me to care about all the main characters involved, especially with its rather sizable cast. A few moments won't be as satisfying as one would hope, but rest assured, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat or holding back tears enough times to sit back and say that it was worth it.
Story: 6/10
The ""plot"" of a character-driven show is kind of hard to define. Pretty much everything that happens in the story happens because a certain main character acted a certain way. The events that were ""plot-driven"", actually felt rather forced in comparison to the others. It doesn't happen to often, but again, when something happens because the story demands it rather than any real reason, it doesn't feel very natural to the story. However, these are rare, so I'll more or less give it a pass.
Art: 10/10
The visuals in Toradora are flat-out amazing. For a lot of shows that I've watched, there have been moments where it feels like a scene or cut was thrown in because it'd be cheaper to animate. While Toradora doesn't necessarily have any less of these, it at least becomes more of an artistic choice rather than a easy means of saving money. Characters designs are gorgeous, with Kitamura being pretty much the only design I didn't totally buy into. If I can be allowed to gush for a second, I will mention that Taiga may just be the best looking anime character that I've ever seen.
Sound: 7/10
To be honest, sound in anime doesn't ever particularly stand out to me that much, with exception of a select few. However, the emotional scenes were properly emotional, the funny scenes were funny, and the romantic scenes sounded romantic. I guess the true beauty of the soundtrack is that it just blends perfectly with what's going on. It never really stood out, but it worked nonetheless.
Character: 10/10
Easily this show's strong suit. I can't even begin to explain the care that was put into the characters, or even particularly why every individual one is as good as they are. It's really something that you have to see in action. You usually start off liking/disliking one character or another, but they all take their turn in the spotlight and, when it boils down to it, you end up appreciating (if not loving) all the characters for their flaws and talents.
Enjoyment: 9/10
What a perfect way to spend a weekend. I was very motivated to watch this show, which is a huge factor for me. I'm a bit of a completionist, and if I start an anime, I usually have to finish it. However, I didn't even need an excuse to continue through the episodes of this one, as the characters and their stories always kept me coming back right away. It's a fun show.
Overall: 9/10
I truly enjoyed Toradora, and I feel like a 9/10 is earned well by this show on both personal and critical fronts. What keeps it from having a perfect score, in my mind, are simply the show (a) slowing down a little in the middle episodes, and (b) by having a largely unnecessary bittersweet ending. Yes, the payoff was still glorious, but the latter half of the last episode can be painful to watch when you feel like everybody's already been through enough. However, I have this complaint with many other shows, so it's not particularly surprising at this point, I guess.
All in all, watch Toradora. It's a beautifully executed character drama that is very much worth its salt.",9

                Toradora has that typical short loli tsundere thing that Kugimiya Rie is used to playing and this time she does it well. it didn't come off as completely nail grating but she wasn't the best thing about this series. 
Ami and Minorin were much better picks though it felt a little forced towards the end like they weer saying ""hell let's just finish this crap now, OTP ending FTW""
Fairly good romance comedy though.

                Love is one of the strongest positive feelings that we get to experience as humans. When we're in love with someone, the feeling surrounds us, warms our heart, makes it flutter and puts us in a state of trance. But beyond that, real love at its core is all about learning to love someone and being able to be a good lover yourself to surmount difficulties in life together.
When we're growing up and become teenagers, we're all brainwashed to believe certain stereotypes about love, about what it means to be in love and what we're supposed to expect from being in a relationship with someone.
                  This is one of the big reasons why many adults struggle to form meaningful, long term relationships with other adults, because most people believe that love should be this permanent feeling of ecstasy filled with filmesque moments and no discord or fighting at all. 
Love is supposed to make you feel warm and fuzzy, but not every waking moment of your life. Love is sometimes rough, because life is rough, we're all imperfect as humans, and we all have our own problems as well as problems that come up with our loved ones throughout.
Toradora exemplifies this perfectly. Out of all romance stories I have ever experienced in any medium, this anime perfectly manages to catch the most realistic and wholesome vision of love that one could possibly adopt. Tsundere memes aside, this anime is filled with wholesome, cute moments but also with many gritty, rough, harsh moments of doubt and trouble in life that our main duo will have to overcome together to find out why their vision of love up until that point has been so skewed, and what really matters to them in love. 
Just watching the first few minutes of the first episode captures all of this perfectly. 
Toradora is an anime that is an absolute must-watch for anyone interested in the genre and/or in a realistic, wholesome vision of romance. I'd even go as far as to say that any teenager remotely interested in anime should watch this, as the story between Ryuji and Taiga presents a much better example of how a healthy long -term relationship can start over any stupid Instagram reel or TikTok out there.
(Just don't take the whole tsundere thing too seriously, kicking your boyfriend in the ribs irl isn't all that nice after all)",9
"
                Honestly one of the best romance anime I've ever watched.
 I'm glad I decided to watch this, I loved it. It was enjoyable, funny, dramatic, and made me cry quite a few times.
 I recommend this wholeheartedly to people just beginning to explore/wanting more from the romance genre. You're sure to have a good time with this one.
What really made it for me was the romance aspects of the show. It's fairly well done and the characters feel so damn relatable. 
Of course, like any other anime, there are some plot holes and weird bits, but then again, it's expected. Nothing is perfect.
The voice acting and animation is especially praiseworthy. They did a darn good job, I have to say it made the show so much more immersing.
All in all, a great show I had a great time watching. Would definitely recommend",9
"
                I tried watching this two times and I couldn't get into it either time. I want to punch Taiga in her bratty little face and I want the dude to stand up for himself. I think the characters are unique but the story is cliche and predictable and I just couldn't bring myself to continue it. I got too impatient waiting for Taiga to grow up, but apparently maturity and height for her are both impossible. I think I get the appeal but I just couldn't stand the characters. The first 15 seconds of the intro are pretty catchy--I usually didn't skip it. I was
                  hoping for a bit more substance in the characters and I know I haven't seen a lot of episodes but I just couldn't find the willpower to continue. The concept appealed to me when I first heard about Toradora! but I found it to be pretty bland once I started. I usually really like romcoms but this one didn't live up to my expectations considering the hype.",5
"
                This is my usual style as I mostly watch Romantic Comedy anime so when I started watching this I thought that maybe it would be in my top 10 or just not that close to some of my favorite animes.
I WAS SOOO WRONG! I absolutely loved watching this ROMCOM and definitely recommend it, it is by far my favourite anime and I believe it may always be.
I especially enjoyed that I can relate to Taiga so much, being a relatively short person (only an inch smaller then Taiga) I can relate to her temper when people call her short. Her birthday is also only 3
                  days before mine which is also cool!
I truly fell in love with this show and hope that you can too.

"
                Originally I was definitely putting this anime on hold as I was watching a ton of animes but recently I had time to finish it and I was not disappointed. The reason I got into this anime was mainly because I had seen a video where they had mentioned it. It isn't one of your everyday shoujo with these 2 people destined to meet each other. Its with Taiga being the tsundere which she is and hating Ryuji. After many different problems and climaxes there bond grows and the story eventually falls into place.

"
                It honestly feels disappointing when a show immerses you into its characters and their relationships, then throws everything out the window within its last few moments. It epitomizes the primary example of what could have been...glimpses of a defining and solid story to be remembered for years. Anime seems to be the most prone to this, as with the boom of seasonal viewing people are bound to be more dismayed by what the original premise boasts and captivates people with.
Even with its 9-year old age, Toradora! remains as one of the memorable romance anime out there, and with good reason. Aside from nailing the archetypal
                  tsundere through its main characters, you also have a very quirky cast to set up for interesting and comedic scenarios. The chemistry between Taiga and Ryuuji has kept me hooked through its episodes—and this has been my belief for eight years after watching until the 16th episode before eventually fading away from anime. And it still was. Toradora became my favorite romance anime of all time...
Up until the final two episodes.
The one important thing about anything involving romance is to not bother about the story—romance is romance, and no matter how much you try to candy-coat it with grandiose settings, it's always gonna end up on one of two things: a) They end up with each other or b) They go on their separate ways. The only thing that matters is execution through its characters and pacing. Toradora had all that—it had proper seed-planting for development, dropping all these little hints of their relationship blooming together, as well as the rise of several conflicts that make everything seem oh-so natural. It culminated with its monumental Christmas episode that easily became one of my favorite episodes in any show.
The characters, of course, propel this execution with good prowess. I actually didn't think Taiga was a tsundere, since she shifted into a much more realistic character by the second half of the show. Ryuuji, while honestly being dense, was entertaining to watch despite his one-sided personality at times. Plus, there need to be more clean freaks like him out there. Ami, from being one of my most hated characters (for eight years!) earns the title of best wingman, while I came to understand more of Minori's character as time passed by. Kitamura was...okay, I guess. I mean, he wasn't really the focus of the show, so it's fine that he had at least an arc dedicated to him. He was funny as a gag character, but was ultimately more uninteresting than Ryuuji. My favorite character in the series, though, is their homeroom adviser Yuri, which reminds me a lot of Yukari from Azumanga Daioh.
Sound was well-placed, and there are some few good pieces that stand out, but what really makes it shine is the opening song that screams nostalgia on one end, and a very catchy and upbeat mood-setter on another. Most of all, the special insert song from the Christmas episode really hits home with how contrasting its beats are from the theme of the episode, but fitting to a character as Taiga and her motivations as a person.
There's nothing much to point at with regards to animation, as J.C. Staff delivers well enough especially when it comes to romance anime. It is pretty dated for a 2008 show, and when I compare it to another 2008 show I'm currently watching, Aria the Origination, I feel somewhat underwhelmed by how Toradora looks like. Still, it does what it does, and it has times to shine when it needs to—examples being the field trip episode and the magical kissing scene.
I mentioned prior that a good romance show just needs to handle characters and pacing, and these two are also reliant to have the viewers remain attached to them. Mari Okada nails the script for the series in a nicely done way, as aforementioned with its careful seed-planting and subtle dialogue that may speak less but shows more about the character. Most of these hints can be picked up especially in Ami's parts, and while the episodes went on the show had dedicated a large part of its efforts to entice the viewer with her actions and motivations. Her character remains as a solid presence in the show, even up until the last two episodes—
The last two episodes that threw it all away.
I'm not a sucker for melodrama, but I appreciate shows that make these work. AnoHana was one of them. Your Lie in April was not one of them. Toradora was supposed to be one of them.
All of a sudden, Ryuuji and Taiga's lives are forced into this scenario about their families starting to get involved in their futures—which, mind you, came after another melodramatic confrontation between him, her and Minori. It was terrible. Everything that the series had worked up to present a natural conclusion becomes shoved out the window, and now you're also coerced to watch this very uncalled-for series of events.
The show had already done a great deal of melodrama by the beginning of its second half, but they were presented in a well-paced and emotionally satisfying manner. The last two episodes had none of those. The only thing close to satisfying was the kiss—but even Ryuuji's side of things aren't even laid down very well. Up until the last episodes of the series, he STILL has feelings for Minori—and that should be something we should have witnessed fade away to build up for this romantic conclusion. Instead, we get a claustrophobic scenario between friends and family, then the friends help them, then the family helps them, then all of a sudden Taiga moves away without any proper goodbyes—all in the course of two goddamn episodes.
It irks me more that this wasn't the light novel ending, which made things more reasonable despite also being forced drama. I don't think it was the worst thing in the world. But it gatecrashed a classic in the making.
Granted, some may still say Toradora is one of the defining romance anime out there, and I can still agree to an extent. The final two episodes have varying effects to its viewers, and my reaction about it is just one side of the spectrum. This show is still fun to watch for all it's worth, as seen from my praises about its comedy and good melodrama (for like, 11 episodes). To my perspective, however, the show remains as an example of anime not being able to wrap up satisfyingly, most of the time.",7
"
                 So where do I begin? Well, I suppose I could start with the fact that I watched Toradora! well ahead of my dark descent into the otaku rabbit hole. Because of that I was able to enjoy the series without experiencing the cringe that many of the character tropes would develop into years later. Now, after re-watching the series, It's as if spraying on a new coat of pain. Paint. I meant paint.
 I truly love the series and If I had not watched it when I did, I could not say I'd look at it as positively as I do. IMO it's aged
                  well. I can say that with confidence because I only cringed when two certain magpies showed up.
 The story is what really had me hooked. What we would now call a generic rom-com now was, at the time, very touching and scarce. The character development between Taiga and Ryuuji was slow and sweet. I loved every moment of their interactions. The episode in which Ryu fiercely reprimands Taiga for her attempts to ignore her Dad, only to realize he's an uncaring opportunist that only cares for himself, is a good example. Ryuuji promises to himself to never be like that, and it really shows towards the end when he realizes things about his own father. That and several other moments of the show made me feel as if it was portraying my own life. You rarely find an anime now with that much sincerity and drive for every episode to tell a different story to sculpt the world and characters you're watching.
 The art is classic J.C Staff, which I still love to this very day. Call me old, but I love the retro flow of the art style. I swear if it wasn't for that, there'd be no way I could have choked down Index III.
 The main characters all had so much love and passion put into their every word that I found myself enjoying every interaction they had. All except the barbie dolls Minori and Ami that both remind me of a Dodge Challenger. All the effort was put into making it look good, but one peek at the inside reveals that about as much effort went into making it as a McDonald's Happy Meal Toy. They took about half of the enjoyment from me. 
 By the end I was overjoyed with both happiness and sadness. Happiness that they got their happy ending and hopefully some of the characters were victims of truck-kun later down the line, and sadness that I knew I had to say goodbye and return to my own life. It gave me a new perspective on a lot of things that I still carry with me today. 
 It might not be up to today's standards, and Cthulhu help me I wanted to rate this lower thanks to the sandpaper napkins Minori and Ami, but I found it enjoyable to re-watch nonetheless.",7
"
                Toradora was a fantastic anime with great humor and some interesting backgrounds to the characters. Although anybody could have seen Ryuji and Taiga's hook-up inevitable, it was still nice to see how it developed. The drama in here is pretty deep, but at times it seemed awfully cliche, though most of the time was amasing, especially the fight scenes! Yes I said fight scenes and believe me, they come at the most dramatic of times and offer some ground shaking feelings into the series.
However there were elements that could have been fixed: The feelings from Minori towards Ryuji should have been made more clear, however
                  the feelings of Taiga towards Ryuji were also shaky and were well hidden. Plus the ending (don't worry there's no spoiler here), was a little.. How do I put this? ""Crappy"" with little closure and deviation from a perfect ending.
Overall 8/10, I stress that the endings in anime really affect the way I grade an anime, but there were some other elements that changed my decision.
PS: Taiga is an exact clone of Louise from Zero no Tsukaima! XD",8
"
                It's my first time writing a review. It just came to me that since this anime was very indeed great(!), I should write a review about it for other people to know how great an anime it really is. 
And kind of like share my good interest in this anime. 
Main points I liked:
1. Character development and their individual personalities
1. Character interaction - how all characters get involved with each other throughout parts of the story
2. Background stories about the main and extra characters
3. Deep real life stuff - sayings, family issues, relationship issues, etc.
Review's kinda vague. Just shows how much of an amateur I
                  am, but believe me when I say this. It really is one of a kind and of the BEST in slice of life, romance, comedy, and school life.",10
"
                It was a normal, calm Saturday morning...
I woke up and eat some breakfast then proceeded to find a nice anime for myself to watch that day.
I scroll through and I remembered: ""Watch Toradora! You have to!""
So I did...
I watched the first episode, I enjoyed it, I watched the second and as time went passed I finished the whole season at one go in no time!
This anime is a romantic piece of art, nothing more, nothing less.
I recommend this anime to everyone, no matter, this is a MUST WATCH.
Now I truly feel the emptiness of my life. 😂

                This review is divided, one part free of spoilers, and another with spoilers (the start of both have been highlighted)
Hi, I know this is a late review of a old anime, but as it aired at Netflix, I was able to watch it, and I wanted to express my opnion.
Yes, this is my first review, but I hope it is a great one! Just to you guys now I really liked this anime, but it has many mistakes.
-WITHOUT SPOILERS
STORY: 7
-The story is very simple, and it isn't so different, but it is effectable, it has great development and is well presented, but it has its
                  problems. For me the anime in general has more great moments, than bad ones, but during the anime there are big mistakes that can't be forgeted while judging the anime. (If you guys go down this review, you are going to see a part with spoilers, there I will talk more about the anime problems and qualities.)
- I won't talk so much about it, beacuse it isn't special, if you guys want to know about it, read the Synopsis of the anime.
ART: 8
-The art is very well done, I couldn't find some real problem with it. I have to highlight the characters designs, they fit well with the characters themselves,and are well animated.
SOUND: 8
- The sound is not very outstanding, but it doesn't affect your viewer's experience. The voice acting is great, and the OST has some sountracks that  are pretty great, but there are others that aren't so memorable, this is normal.
- What really shines are both OPS, they are awesome, and the first ED is one of my favorites.
CHARACTERS: 7
-  Taiga: Well well well... Taiga is a Tsundere, that after some time her jokes got tiring. Worst girl, she suddenly changed herself. She had a bad devolopment during the series. After some time, I found her a meh character, the side characters, for me are bery better.
- Ryuuji: Ryuuji is a cool and calm main character. He loves cleaning, and is great at cooking. Great character, but near the end he got a bad development, but what can I do? Without any explanation he changed what his choice, beeing so damn forced.
- Minori: Minori is the best girl ( she and Ami are both best girls in reality, they're equals) she is very well developed and a great friend. During the anime they made a bad explanation for letting Minori out of some episodes. I think, they could have used her more, and made a arc about her character, but they prefered to let her unexplored. She is such a different character, and for me when she appears she steal the attention, sooo underated.
- Ami: What can I say? She, Minori and Ryuuji are the best characters. Ami is the most real character of the anime, she is so damn cool, she is excentric and serious. Minori and her are the best.
- Kitamura: Meh character, the most generic. After watching the anime I forgot his name he's the classic ""Glass-kun"". His arc is so bad.
OVERALL: 7
- I enjoyed the show, but in this review, I couldn't really say its problems because they would be big spoilers, so I'm going to write a part with spoilers  in the end of this review. It's a very good anime, I enjoyed it. But, I need to judge the parts that I disliked it. I would recommend this anime, even though it has its errors.
-SPOILERS
-Now I will say what I really think of it, so be ready. Until ep 16 everything was great, but after that... Minori suddenly started felling depressedd because she lost a game, really, what were they thinking? They made that just to make Ryuuji more close to Taiga, and to hava a ass reason to make Ryuuji away from Minori. It was just meaningless, it wasn't even her arc, because she didn't had one.
- The ending OMG what a trash, Ryuuji just stopped beeing in love with Minori, because he felt sorry for Taiga because she said she needed him. I mean what hahaha, first of all Taiga allways loved Kitamura, so why she stopped loving him? Taiga was such a child, influenting the relation of Ryuuji and Minori.
- I mean when Minori finnaly went to the Christmas party, she rejected Ryuuji because Taiga ""needed"" Ryuuji, WHAT? Ryuuji was supposed to decide for himself who he loved, not to stay with Taiga because she ""needed"" him, it was damn forced. Besides Ryuuji allways loved Minori, so WHAT WAS THIS END? 
-I predicted the end from the begginig, really only by reading the synopsis I said:""Oh, it's obvious that both main characters are going to end together if this is a MEH anime"" And well, I was really really hoping it wouldn't finished in this way, but I knew it would end this way, not because I knew spoiler, but because it was so damn predictable.",7

                As I'm not a native English speaker and my vocabulary and eloquence isn't at the level necessary to describe how garbage this show is this will be a quick one.
I initially got drawn to this show because I used to love romance anime. Never have I felt so betrayed by a piece of media.
Toradora: Physical and mental abuse, the anime. But there's a twist! The abuser is a tiny girl who defies physics and all laws of  reality and the abused is a scary looking but actually timid guy who's twice her size and for a reason unbeknownst to me just takes it all
                  with a smile :)
I cant for the life of me find anything positive to say about this show and the only reason I've completed it is because I watched it when I was fairly new to anime and finished every show I started.
The fact that this series is so highly regarded is sickening and used to fill me with a tremendous amount of hate and disgust but at this point I've learned to accept the insanity that we live in.
Thank you for reading about how much I hate this show.",2
"
                Okay. I'll start this very short review about this series. I'll make it in outline form so that it won't be very log. If there are any flaws in my review, accept my sincerest apologies....
Story: 9
          Romantic-comedy anime titles like this one is very common now. What sets ToraDora! apart from other rom-coms is the way how romance and comedy are balanced plus the main plot itself. The first half of the anime is more on comic relief and hints of romantic developments and it will surely make the viewers laugh their hearts out for a
                  few hours. The latter half of the anime however, deals with more of the drama and romantic elements of the story. The series is very good in terms of mood-swings, character conflicts and etc. Story is very true in real-life situations and people can relate to it properly.

        Animation and the drawings are great, but not top of the line. How should I say this, ToraDora didn't hook me up because of its superb anime style. Anyway, the plot itself makes it up for graphic deficiencies. But it's not that bad though. Example: the eyes of Kushieda Minori and Kawashima Ami. For me, these two should have been improved in terms of the way they are drawn. Nevertheless, the style is unique and i must commend the animators for that..
Sound:  9
        I love the OST's of this anime plus the voice actors and actresses. J.C. Staff hired Rie Kugimiya (my favorite) to do the voice acting for Aisaka Taiga (the main character) and Yui Horie for Kushieda Minori. Sound effects are pretty good because it engages the audience during the mood-shifts and the change in events.
Characters:  8
        A good story needs well organized characters. In this anime, the characters are very lovable and their traits are very realistic. That's why many people (including myself) can relate to them. Character development is very well established for a 25-episode series. These characters will make you laugh and at the same time cry when it comes to the more serious parts.
Enjoyment: 9
       Very funny and hilarious. All characters have very distinct characteristics that are very funny. Comic relief is evident from the first 3/4 part of the story.
Overall: 8
        For romance-comedy fans, this is a must watch for you. Prepare for a roller-coaster ride of comedy, drama and romance and i'm pretty sure that you will enjoy this series from start to finish just like I did. Hope this review helped you in finding new anime to watch..^_^

"
                When I started watching it, I thought it was a bit bland, the characters were generic anime archetypes (the tsundere, the queen bee etc). That opinion persisted through the early episodes and I decided I didn't like it very much.
Then a vid popped up in my Youtube feed talking how about how amazing it was and I decided to give it another go.
... Wow. Twenty-five episodes later and I'm speechless. Toradaora is an emotional rollercoaster without equal, a masterclass in the fragility of the human heart and the complex and murky nature of human relationships and what drives us as people. The characters are incredibly
                  well written and frighteningly believeable in their at times confusing, jealous or self destructive motivation and the choices and mistakes they make that characterise the human experience. Every character has a major flaw and the way the anime comes full circle through the growth in it's major characters is amazing. Watching characters that are written imperfect grow and evolve into a state of self awareness and self acceptance was a joy to behold. What an amazing anime! On par with Madoka Magicka for sheer emotional catharsis and payoff after such a slow start.",10
"
                (This is my first review so please bear with me.)
Toradora is a romantic comedy that really made me spark my love for romantic comedy up again. I'll try and keep this short for your sake and mine, and attempt to explain exactly why you should watch this anime, especially if:
A: You've never seen it before
B: You're trying to find a new rom-com to watch
C: You need to find a good romantic comedy to begin with because you're new to the genre.
Toradora follows up our two main characters through some of the most touching moments I've seen in anime history. It has truly earned its slice
                  of life status just through some of the minor actions between these two, but at the same time it manages to feel hilarious through the same boat, as if it's real enough to where you can almost relate to each character. 
When the plot progresses and real emotion sets in you'll be happy that you stayed along for the ride because literally every episode besides maybe one or two has something worth seeing in it that almost guarantee your satisfaction
Artwork: 9, the movements of each character during a dramatic scene really brought out emotion
Story: 10, It's hard to explain why if you haven't watched it, but give it a shot and you'll see what i mean
Sound: 8, The intro music doesn't really seem to match up well with the actual show all that well? But the rest of the OST is great, and even the dub is good.
Character: 9-10, The main characters were written really well, and even a few of the side characters really seem to stick with you in thought, but the two best friends of Ryuuji and Taiga? They seem to lack any real... definition? 
Enjoyment: 10, Just watch the show, trust me on this.
I'd give it an overall of 9.5/10, if only because Ryuuji is so perfectly fine with being pushed around 95% of the time.
To sum it up, this show tells a really good story from the perspective of Ryuuji about his life after meeting Taiga and it is truly worth your time. You may not agree with my scores 100% when you finish it, but I'm willing to bet you wont hate it.",10
"
                I always have a thing for romantic anime even though I find dragon ball z and Naruto equally good,
Toradora! was in my plan to watch list for a long time I never realised the anime would turn out to be so good, as the cover page looked like just a story of a short girl and a scary looking guy but just yesterday as I finished other anime's I decided to watch this and I am so happy I did, it made me realise so many things in life...no matter how bad things get with family no matter how bad was the confession, no matter
                  how bad you look  ""WE CAN STILL BE HAPPY TO BE ALIVE"".
The Art- The art was done wonderfully everything was well made and the Graphics were great to.9/10
The character- The 2nd best part of this anime was the characters , a chill mom, a scary looking but nice guy, a cute looking girl but also a peril personality, a best parrot, and also the amazing group of friends who are always looking after each other-10/10
Enjoyment-i loved watching this anime it made me realise no matter how cringe your confession can be its always worth a try ;) it was a 100% worth of time and if you are a fan of romantic anime then you will come to tears....10/10
The STORY- The story of the anime is the finest story you can see its very different from the typical anime story ''the girl and boy falling for each other, Toradara had the sweetest and cutest story so far.10/10
Overall- I had a great time with each episode.10/10
Please give this anime a try , also this is my first review so sorry for the mistakes.",10
"
                My feelings on Toradora are all over the board. The show made me laugh and cry. But it also left me very confused and disappointed at times. 
Let's break it down. 
The art is pretty awesome. The facial expressions that are captured are spot on and character movement looks fluid and realistic. But I do have one gripe about the art: Everyone has huge eyes in this series except for Ryuuji. And it bugs me. Like seriously bugs me. 
The musical selections are pretty mediocore. Listen to the first OP to see what I mean.
The characters are all lovable and relatable in some way. They
                  actually seem like characters and not just your typical mean girl or tsundere- the story gives them depth.
The story can be annoying or disgustingly cute. What I mean by the story being annoying: characters will hit each other or run away or give up on the person they claim to love... for no reason. It doesn't add to the story it only confuses me. What I mean by grossly cute: let's kiss 4 times in a row and keep saying ""one more"" in between each kiss. 
Overall I gave this anime a 7 but I think that's generous.",7
"
                Outstanding anime. I usually get tired of romance anime's where the characters romantic feelings get delayed for so long but Toradora! has changed my mind completely. 
Taiga reminds me of myself; I'm small, feisty and definitely broken - so there were many times I laughed like a villain as Taiga did something spiteful and dramatic. 
The overall story is a refreshing one and it isn't your usual high school romance anime either. The different characters really add a nice twist to what you'd expect from a romance comedy. 
Now, the romance in Toradora! is so fiery that it's almost annoying, I was left screaming at
                  my laptop screen saying ""JUST ADMIT IT ALREADY!"" 
Even so, the frustration and build-up was worth it because it resulted in a beautiful, humorous ending. 
10/10 for everything (even the frustration!)
Toradora! is a gem - I highly recommend.",10
"
                I liked Toradora a lot. Now, I almost dropped it in the first two episodes for excessive female on male violence, but it got much better after that. I think it did a great job with character development and it had good pacing.
The end however was a bit unfulfilling for me. I really wanted to see Kitamura and Minori get together or something like that, the whole thing just felt rather anticlimactic. Maybe they'll do an OVA or something to wrap up the story in a better way. It's completely worth your time though.
One of the things I really liked was that they actually show
                  them kissing, there are so many romance anime/manga that don't for some reason.",9
"
                     This was the first anime series I have ever seen.  While I had familiarized myself with many if the Miyazaki films, I never really was into anime simply because I thought all the sci-fi and action scenes looked super cheesy.  I eventually found out not all anime is like that, and subsequently ran into ""Toradora!"".  After finishing the series, I can say I was not disappointed.
     The strong suit of the show is definitely the characters.  The way the story slowly progresses and allows the characters time to breathe makes up for
                  a very engaging experience.  My one minor nitpick is that I found myself a little bit more drawn to the side characters than the two main characters.  (Especially Minori, I wish there was an entire side-series based on her life after what happens in this series.)
     As for the story, it didn't have a ""typical high school drama"" feel that I expected.  There were far more emotional moments than I was expecting.  In turn, though, this made the story even more interesting.  It started off almost like a teen comedy, but eventually turned into a very engaging drama.  I love shows that do that.
     Overall, I highly recommend ""Toradora!"" to anybody who loves school anime or romance anime.  Without giving away anything, my only gripe is that the ending left me cold a little bit.  Other than that, it was all good.",9
"
                TL;DR: Toradora is a nice watch if you like Slice of Life & Romance. For me, it's still only an 8/10 simply because it felt a bit dragged in the middle, thus basically being a pure slice of life (even if love still was the whole focus of the show) with romantic development only being in the last few episodes.
________________
Story - 
The story is about the classmates (and neighbours) Taiga and Ryuuji, with Taiga being in love with a friend of Ryuujis and Ryuuji being in love with a friend of Taigas, which led them to help eachother out. As you would expect from a
                  story like this, in the end they fall for eachother instead. (If that's a spoiler for you.. well) Of course, there are more characters introduced over time, each with their own love interests. This overall gives the show a nice atmosphere and I personally ended up liking all characters.
What I disliked was that the part of both helping eachother out with confessing to their crushes made up the majority of the show, while the really interesting stuff in my opinion was the last 5-6 episodes, when they realise how they feel about eachother and what they make of it. That also means that there will be nothing romantic happening between them until the last few episodes. One could have strapped the beginning of the series of a few episodes, or perhaps let them realise their love foreachother more gradually, instead of being like ""BAM! Oh wait! I love you now"".
Art & Sound -
It's well done, nothing to complain.
Characters -
The characters in Toradora are really well done. All the relevant characters are pretty distinctive in their personality, backstory (as far as it gets shown of course), and looks. Surprisingly, this even counts for their other classmates with basically no impact to the show itself, other than just filling up the typical ""classmate buddy"" spots. The diversity in the characters personalities and actions surely was an awesome part of the show.
Enjoyment -
It doesn't try to shove you a bucket load of forced jokes in the face each episodes, or try to build up some ""funny"" situations all the time. Overall it still was a romance / drama, highly focused on the characters, their feelings and development, but with some comedy sprinkled in to lighten the mood. That made it quite enjoyable.",8
"
                Toradora! is a romcom about two high school students that decide to help each others conquering their respective crush. If you're a fan of the romcom genre then you should definitely check it out, as long as you don't mind clichés and drama.
Spoiler warning, if you haven't watched the series, then stop reading, it may ruin your experience.
I am not gonna judge art and sound, I'm not a hardcore anime reviewer, It's better if the professionals handle this kinda job, I gave them an 8 considering that if something like bakemonogatari or fate/zero is a 10 to me, this could be an easy 8. 
What
                  I am gonna talk about is the characters and the story:
I don't really get why people overhype this series so much. If you scroll through the reviews, you'll literally see 10s everywhere! I get that people may get really hooked by it, but a 10 honestly seems too much.
Why? Here's why:
The story is really predictable, it's definitely does a good job in delivering, though, but once you get to the second half of the series it becomes really easy to see where it's going.
The characters are overall likeable, but some interactions are not explained properly, especially with Taiga: all throughout the series, I never really got to understand why people really like her as much as they do. Okay that she is the protagonist, okay that she is ""cute"", but she has a very spoiled personality, with a ""dere"" side of her tsundere archetype that IMO does not justify all the affection she receives by the supporting cast. 
The main character is interesting, definitely quirky enough to make him likeable, realatable, but also very unique. The only problem I have with Ryuji is that he had potential to be really fleshed out and developed through the situation with his dad, maybe with a flashback or maybe even showing the audience how his dad used to be. I also have a problem in how in the last few episodes his personality completely twists around ina  very unnatural way. I understand that it needs to show the unpredictability of teenagers and how they can reason completely against common sense, but to me it was too much and ruined his character.
Unfortunately we don't get to see much development of the supporting cast either. The anime spends so much time reinforcing Ryuji's relationship with Taiga that it seems to ""forget"" about Ami and Kitamura, two of my favorite characters that (probably because of a personal preference) I would have loved to see more of. Maybe showing some explanations for why and how Ami got to fall in love with Ryuji and how she came up with the decisions she made, where her maturity complex started and how, why she doesn't believe in friendship as much as she should. Same for Kitamura, I'd have appreciated seeing more of his personality, why he is the way he is and maybe seeing some more interactions between him and Ryuji, whom we are meant to believe he's really good friend with, but we don't really see them hanging out much. It seems like these potentially great characters are seen, in the end as more of a plot device rather than people. Overall it doesn't really bother me as much as it disappoints me, especially when I came into this series with high expectations seeing how much the anime community seems to love it. 
In conclusion, maybe it's because I'm not the greatest fan of the usage of ""lolis"" in anime (I generally tend to overlook it in case of really great storytelling like the mongatari series), maybe it's because I'm not a fan of the tsundere-esque personality of the ""main girl"", maybe because I have seen too much and grown too old to really enjoy such a cheesy and predictable love story, maybe because my favorite characters were not fleshed out as much as I wanted, I really can't give this series a higher grade than a 7, and even that is a stretch for me. Honestly I personally can't understand all those 10s. If I were to reccomend a similar series that I believe works better, it'd be the monogatari series or (if you don't mind reading manga) Love Hina or, to an extent, even Nisekoi. That's mostly because since they are longer series, they have more time to really develop each and every character properly.
I am sorry if my really opinionated review does not resonate with how you perceived the series, but with all these 10s, I felt obliged to bring up these matters of criticism and discussion that I found watching this anime. It's not a bad watch at all, but if you're not a hardcore fan of the genre, I'd suggest to skip it.
Hope you find this helpful",7

                WARNING:
I'm not a professional reviewer and this is my subjective opinion.
This review is going to be full of grammar errors and i'm not even going to try and fix them unlike on my other reviews.
Also, this time I am completely scrambled emotion-wise, so this review is probably going to consist of me rambling some random stuff about the anime.
If I had even a gram of self-respect towards myself, then I probably wouldn't have posted this review. But I also feel as if me not posting a review on this anime would be disrespectful.
In other words:
If you're looking for a well-constructed review, then this is not
                  for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy people splattering their emotions everywhere- then this is for you.
This time i'm not going to be serious, this anime has brought me a mix of confusion hapiness and satisfaction. This is not a serious review in the sense that I'm not going to try and be polite. I'm not going to criticize anything in deep details. I enjoyed this anime because of specific reasons that even I dont know, and I can't put my hand on it no matter how much I try.
TL;DR:This is not a serious review, this is my subjective opinion and if you want a normal review, then there are plenty of those kinds of people in the review section.
I usually try to be as professioal as possible, but not this time.
Now here's the actual review:
Toradora is a very great anime. It's not exceptional, and even though I feel bad that i'm not giving a 10/10 score, I didn't even intend on giving it a review anyway.
This review was never meant to exist.
It only exists because I would've felt as if I was giving it a disservice not making this review.
At first I didn't even catch a grip with this anime. Multiple times in fact.
I avoided it for multiple years. I once tried watching it as a little kid, but the ""grip"" with the anime was even more slippery than it was now. I definitely liked the anime. And while it's definitively not the first, you still can't judge it for being another ""RomCom Conveyor anime"" because it WAS one of the first. I enjoyed it but even as I am writing this review, it feels as if something is wrong. I'm happy and I'm not sad that it ended, but something is just under my skin. Something feels wrong. Not about the anime but about the enjoyment that I got out of it. 
It was good, I felt happy. Even when there were sad scenes I felt happy. Because it was executed very well. 
I am very confused, and I DIDN'T want to write this review. I am forcing myself to write it because again, as I said:""In my opinion, it would be disrespectful not to write a review about it.""
I hate this feeling, it's so confusing! 
I love this anime but I hate the confusion that came with it.
The anime itself is so straight forward, but it confuses me. Not the story, not anything.
Basically I like the anime, but it feels wrong. Not the anime, but the feelings that I felt from it.
I liked the anime.
It made me happy. I am satisfied with the anime, but not with myself.
Sorry for being so goddamn irritated. I will try to summarize everything:
I loved this anime. The art was pretty unusual. But it gets better once you get used to it.
The story was nice, and I loved the improvement in the characters.
Ugh, to be honest i'm spewing out random bullshit at this point.
I'm sorry but I can't tell you a solid opinion on this anime.
It felt good.
The ending was good.
It wasn't completely conclusive.
But it didn't feel like a show that lead you on a fake trail and then left you.
I am confused.
But the anime was great. It's very great, not a 10/10 for sure. But it was great.
The very least I can say about it is that it was heartwarming.
It's like a mother, comforting you when you're crying.
It touched on family issues, but it didn't become a drama-centered anime.
Yeah... The least I can say for sure, is that it was comforting.
It was great. It was calming. Even when someone cried, or was angry... I felt peaceful.
It... Well it was great.
I don't have anything else to say.
Not because the anime was crap, no it's insulting to even think about calling it that. 
It's because it was peaceful.
The ending left me in peace.
Sure, a second season would be great, perhaps an expansion on the main-character relationship.
But it doesn't need it.
It would be nice, but it doesn't require a second season.
It was a good ending and PLEASE don't misinterpret this review.
The anime is fucking GREAT, I am confused because I AM in some deep mental shit. NOT because the anime is shit.
I would definitively recommend it.
I am sorry, I just felt as if I had to post this review.
In short, the anime is heartwarmig and I would definitively recommend.",9
"
                The tsundere archetype is one of the most debated archetypes among the anime community. Taiga Aisaka might as well be the golden girl of tsunderes in all of anime, the queen of tsunderes might I add. However, one of the things I really commend this anime for is choosing a normal concept of her best friend and herself helping one another with their respective crushes and turning it into something very and truthfully memorable.
First off, the pacing in the anime and the amount of episodes it has for all of the respective characters to change throughout, as we gain to understand what each and every
                  one of them goes through. All of the characters are deeper than just one note hit ""tropes"" that go off of one another quite well. Each of them have dedicated times to each other, not just the main characters and it is through those things that really shows how the anime shines. They are easy to understand and in being adolescence, have varying levels of maturity that feel very realistic. The only minor nit pick I have is that earlier on, someone could easily be turned off by Taiga or Minorin with how ""genki genki"" or ""tsundere"" they could be, or really hate Taiga's immaturity towards Ryuuji. It was something that I didn't like at first but is easily explained as you go through the anime and understand how they are. 
One thing I appreciate about the sound is that they really with the mood of the show. There are a few pieces besides the OP and the endings that play at just the perfect moment together during an emotional scene. I will add too that the openings don't sound completely like your typical anime opening structure reminiscent of 80% of Vocaloid songs. That goes for the art too, it is normal enough to be repeated/stand out somewhat, but serviceable to be very pretty. And, there are certainly moments where the animation is ramped up for a few scenes that need it. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary for me, in a good way!
I would highly recommend this anime, ESPECIALLY if you are a fan of romance animes. It is a very beloved staple that I hold very close to my heart.",9
"
                This anime resonated with me more than probably any other I've watched up to this point. I absolutely loved Toradora!, each and every moment of it. Even independent of my enthusiasm, which I'm sure not everyone will share, I think the show is of an appreciably high quality.
The art and character design are good. I think the animation quality is above average, but not amazing. The voice acting (Japanese) is exceptionally good. The actors for the main cast really nailed their parts. They did a good job making the characters memorable and voicing the wide range of emotions expressed in the series.
It's difficult to talk
                  too much about the story without spoiling it. While the show is mostly episodic, it does have an overarching plot: Taiga's and Ryuji's crushes on Yusaka and Minori, respectively. Not only that, but it also entails romantic, personal, and interpersonal development that I can't detail without spoiling. While the main plot points and themes may not be unique, the execution is excellent.
The character writing is where Toradora! truly shines. The main cast are all unique, multidimensional, and compelling entities that I couldn't help but become invested in. One component of the story that I think makes it particularly interesting, is that as characters develop and relationships change, it causes a ripple effect. For example, Ami joins the cast early on, and then acts as one of the main instigators for an important development involving Taiga. Ami, in turn, reevaluates her world view after being influenced by Ryuji. This character development strategy is used often and done exceptionally well. The continuous growth of the characters over the duration of their high school experience keeps the series fresh.
In conclusion, I think Toradora! is outstanding and definitely worth the watch.",10
"
                Here’s a comedic anime which tells of school crushes and friendship. There is not much plot or story in this anime, but I certainly am yet to find another anime to offer such rich characters. Each and every character has its own uniqueness that I cannot help but to fall in love with almost all of them. And ah, I just love Ryuuji's voice....
The anime is not purely comedy, however, as there are moments where the characters seem to get serious, talking about life. I find it interesting that there could be such unusual metaphors that one could put to describe one’s perception towards subjective
                  matters such as life and feelings.
Although somewhat predictable in some ways, I love Toradora for the very fact that it managed to surprise me despite being so. The art of the anime is also pleasant to my eyes, not too elaborate, yet not overly simplistic. I like the clarity of the colours too. As well as the facial expressions the characters made. It is an anime I would watch and watch again, especially the few last episodes.
Recommendable for romantic comedy suckers, such as myself, who wish for not-so-heavy romance.",9
"
                First review time: Listen Toradora. It's not that I don't like you. Despite what I'm about to say, I still enjoyed the shit out of most of this show. It's not even that you weren't that good. Up to a certain point, I was on-board with giving this show a 9/10, but somewhere along the way, you just lost me.
Before I get to the point where this show lost me, I'd like to preface this by saying, in terms of story, Toradora was fucked from the word go. It's as simple as this, Toradora didn't have enough content for a 25 episode show. This is
                  why, especially around the last half of the show, things start slowing waaaaaaaaay the fuck down and you start wondering why some plot moments that should only take an episode start dragging on into the two to three episode range. 
However, this didn't kill my enthusiasm for the show. The art was beautiful all the way through, the sound was pretty decent, and I was invested enough in the characters to where I'd gladly sit through these slow episodes just to see how they would progress. If the show had continued like the first 80% of the show through to the end, I would've been content with praising the hell out of this anime instead of edging everyone along with what caused me to lose my love for this show.
That loss of love comes from the last 20% of the show. More or less the last 5 episodes. At that point, the plot progression realizes it's reached the end of the show, but still has to fill almost two hours of watch time, and thus hits the brakes and starts making stupid decision after stupid decision at the expense of the story and characters. The story would trudge along from setting to setting, creating contrived scenario after contrived scenario that only served to disinterest me and have me consider skipping episodes in order to keep me watching to the end. Characters started acting un pushing the plot along by delaying any meaningful dialogue that would sort out the fucking mess that they were in at that point.
It was around this time where my favorite character changed. It started out with Taiga as most people would agree, but once she and everyone else decided to act completely contrary to how they were for the previous 20 episodes, I was forced to realize that I had the most in common with my least favorite character at the time, Ami. Like Ami, I was watching these characters and was done with their childish bullshit. Granted, much of her expressing this was with cryptic one-liners about how braindead everyone was, like she was Gandalf or fucking Yoda, but at that point, she was the only one putting in the effort to push the plot along and the only one I could relate to at that point, and that just killed my sack because of how much I hated her for most of the show and how much I loved everyone else, and it's a testament to how fucked these last episodes were that made me turn my least liked character into my favorite.
But even then, that wasn't enough. Even with how slow everything was moving and how most characters were making the dumbest decisions to progress the plot, I still would've given the show an 8/10 had it not been for the ending. That is to say, the last two episodes, where the plot spirals into fucking nonsensetown and just does whatever the fuck it wants because there's 40 minutes left and J.C. Staff realized, likely after huffing a assload of drugs, that they needed to tie up all of the loose plot threads in the most convoluted way possible while creating more plot threads that they have to conclude minutes later. All of this led to what I can only describe as a clusterfuck of rushed and sloppy writing for the last two episodes that, while not ruining the whole anime, ruined the conclusion by making it as contrived and unfulfilling as humanly possible.
By how I'm making it sound, it would seem more reasonable for me to give this show a lower score than a 6/10, but honestly, if I would've stopped after episode 20, watched the big confrontation between the main characters, and watched the payoff at the last episode and none of the other filler, I would've given this show a 9/10, but this show not being long enough for a 25 episode run, along with very poor story and character writing for the last few episodes, a 6/10 is all I can give. 
There, I've said my peace. Now I can stop thinking about this show and move on to something else. Preferably not a romcom (unless it's SNAFU or Love is War).",6

                Short and sweet review. Do you know what to expect from romance anime and are tired of people pointing out the ""genre stereotypes"" and then judging the anime around that? Just want to know if you should watch it? I've got you covered.
So I almost skipped this one due to some bad reviews. But I'm glad I didn't. Most people were sour about the ending. But really I don't see the issue.
My favorite part of this show was easily the characters. Taiga is a great female lead, and I do really enjoy Ryuuji as well. Their interactions were rarely boring. There is a good amount
                  of the ""best friend being in love with the same person"" stuff going on in this anime, but instead of just being a side story or a way to waste time in a few episodes to push off a resolution to the relationship, it's basically the central plot point. And really Toradora is probably one of the best examples of the ""best friend loves the same person"" plot because of how good the characters are.
The ending that gets people salty is really no big deal. The 2 episodes before the final episode, in my mind, are the real payoff episodes. Something happens after all that payoff that seems weird if you missed some story points and don't think a little about WHY what happens actually happens. And yes, if you don't understand it, the final episode seems superfluous and strange and anticlimactic. But in reality it's just the final brick in the wall they were building all season. There is no massive reveal or twist in the final episode, it just literally ties up the last remaining thread they left hanging from the actions taken at the end of the previous episode.
HIGHLIGHTS: The characters (Taiga was so much fun to watch), the dialogue is great, good pacing, ACTUAL RELATIONSHIP PROGRESS (especially in the second half of the show), interesting focus on the ""best friend likes the same person"" theme, good resolution despite final episode being easily misunderstood
DISAPPOINTMENTS: Subtle plot/story points can be overlooked to make ending confusion, good amount of yelling by female MC, because it is focused on the ""best friend likes the same person"" thing it can get REALLY FRUSTRATING watching the back and forth (but in a good way because its not just a side story).",9
"
                A red, misty haze obscures my vision and I start wanting to obliterate things when I think about Toradora.  It is exactly the TYPE of anime I love: a romantic comedy with great character designs, voice acting, lots of fun slice-of-life drama, and funny dialogue.  There are love triangles, character developments, and genuinely moving moments.  However, several things just absolutely ruin the enjoyment for me.  It's a comedy that is just unfunny sometimes (no, Taiga's violent nature is not funny).  It's a slice of life that offers up frustrating instead of soothing plot developments.  It's a romance without ultimately
                  being romantic. 
Really, it's like opening up a beautifully wrapped box from your favorite bakery only to find the cake inside is rotting and crawling with maggots.
First, Taiga (the palmtop tiger) is simply the most annoying tsundere character ever.  Is she the prototype?  Did they start appearing after her popularity from Toradora?  It's not even the her seiyuu's fault.  She is just forced to act in the most irritating manner possible by her creator / writer.  She's violent, behaves in an unfair manner to the other characters, and has very little redeeming qualities as a person.  Eventually I stopped wanting her to go away and started fantasizing about her meeting some horrible, gruesome, slow and excruciatingly painful end.
Second, there are just a few too many improbable events.  People just ""happen"" to overhear things they shouldn't or see things they shouldn't all in the service of the plot.  And people do things that don't follow from their established character.  Don't get me started on the amount of hand-wringing and inability to say the important things to one another.  A certain amount of indecision and drama is necessary in a romantic comedy, and is to be expected.  But the artificial nature of some of the plot here in Toradora is just lazy.
Finally, the wrong people get together in the end.  Of course, the first episode telegraphs the eventual couple.  I'm not spoiling anything: it's obvious from the very first who gets together and why.  But the WAY the show goes about it absolutely maximizes the irritation.  I don't agree with the premise: that people should get together because their flaws kind of match in a complementary way.  Even worse, I cannot say the writer is incorrect in their assessment.  People hook up because they are lonely and find kindred spirits even though they are just using the other person as a kind of self-medication.  But some people call this romantic, right?
As if this were not enough, one of my favorite anime best girls of all time isn't even really considered for crossing the finish line first in the romance race.  She never has a chance and as a viewer you know this, but the story still dangles the possibility in front of you just to flip you off.  I didn't appreciate this almost belligerent taunting.  This character is beautiful, smart, and does things to support everyone, but receives next to no gratitude or love from the other characters (or her creator, for that matter).  Maybe the author is subconsciously working out some bitter resentment towards the people who seem to have it together in life?  (I'll let you in on a little secret: everyone has it equally hard in life, any appearance otherwise is only illusion.)
Well, Toradora has one of the highest MAL scores of all time.  Perhaps it exists as a kind of escapist drama where the viewer can think, ""Yeah, I'm super flawed as a person and I'm really mean to people but I'm totally still deserving of love because that special someone will see how special I am."" And therein lies its appeal: people who want instant gratification in life without putting in hard work.  Shouldn't people work on their own self-confidence and love themselves before messing up other people's lives?  Of course people don't have to be ""perfect.""  But far too often people seek solace in the arms of others without ever addressing the core issues they've been assigned to work on in this lifetime, and it won't lead to fulfillment.  
I believe art should uphold the highest ideals and give us great things to strive for instead of simply reiterating the harmful status quo.  Toradora seems to promote self-destructive co-dependence instead of inner strength, self-reliance, and loving others unconditionally.  It reminds me of how people thought bread was a critical food group when in actuality processed carbs just make you fat and lead to health problems.  It might feel good to be ""needed"" by another person while running away from your personal problems, but it's not any proper foundation for a lasting or meaningful relationship.",7

                Ok well i rate animes on whether or not they give you what they say they will give you. This anime gives you completely what it tells it will give you, with a nice story to it. Ill tell you what, if you are looking for a harem anime that will give you goose bumps and make you feel many different good feelings, this anime one to watch.
Art-(10) The art in this anime is REALLY nice. The characters and the scenery is really favorable and a guarantee you will like it.
Story-(8) The story in this anime is somewhat unique but I give it an 8
                  and not a 9 because it is the basics for the story is the same as most harem animes but then again it has some really unique things that other harems don't have which gives the high ratings it gets.
Characters-(9) There is a nice variation of personalities for the characters in this anime and that is the basic thing that makes a harem a success. Characters involve the clueless one but still very sharp, the tsundere everyone loves, the smart guy, the guy who people think is scary, and the evil but beautiful.
This anime is really good for all harem lovers and is fun to watch every once in a while. For all harem lovers, you will not find another harem like this one it is unique and you will like it.",9

                SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS
   Toradora!. Where do I even begin. Troadora! was, wait no... Is one of the best anime that I watched. At the beginning I was a little hesitant to watch it, usually I am not the kind of guy to watch a romantic comedy such as this, But I sure am glad that I did.
   The characters at the start of the show are definitely different than they are at the end. You really see the character development and the things that happen in the show seem to have the same effects on them as they would a normal
                  person. I have yet to find another anime, that in my opinion, has the same touch to the character development as this one does. 
   The story was also very realistic in my opinion. The more time you spend with someone and the more memories that you and this person share, the more you start to grow feelings with said person. This show did a terrific job at showcasing the emotional roller-coaster that is falling in love with a friend, especially in high school.
   Speaking of the high school setting, I do feel like that it has been used over and over again in many shows. However, the way that it was portrayed felt unlike any other/ Almost as if the actions transpired were real events jotted down as they played out. 
   From the very beginning I know that Taiga and Ryuuji were meant to be together. the way that they acted towards one another or the way they were always hanging out and they knew a lot about each other. I'm not too sure why I assumed they were going to be together but something told me they were. Although, how they came to be was still a shocker to me.
   This show will definitely  be one that I will be revisiting in the future and I honestly look forward to it. It took me by surprise and i really did enjoy it. The only thing that I would complain about is the length of it. I wish it were longer and kept going after the last episode. It would have been great to see what happened after the two got together.",10
"
                Toradora! is one emotional story. What's really easy to do is to fall in love with the characters based on their backgrounds. In the beginning Ryuuji is seen as a criminal by his classmates and has to deal with the rumors spread which can be very relateable. Taiga's backstory is more of a spoiler but in the beginning she rubs off as a little brat. As the story progresses you can see changes in her that demonstrate good qualities even though most find her crazy. The best quality of this anime is the character development by how it uses side characters to give the main
                  ones direction while they have their own epitome. The story is slow at first but it gets really interesting when the goals of the characters start to change waiver and refocus. The ending is not unsatisfying at all and will leave most in tears. If you are looking for a typical dramatic romance with good qualities then this is probably a great one to watch :)",9
"
                when i first heard of this anime i thought it was going to be another over hyped anime that would give my hopes up and i kept brushing it aside for a long time. but then i finally gave it a chance and i was surprised the artwork was decent, the character development was amazing i don't i have ever seen a series with better character development. and i perfer watching dubs over subs and the english dub wasn't half bad they did a pretty good job with that one. but i thought this was going to be some cute fluffy romance story but near
                  the end it got really deep.
which caused me to love the show even more and these problems were relateable and there were so many funny moments in this as well. the only problem i had with the show was ami i didn't like her that munch and she got on my nerves but that didn't stop me from watching it and it shouldn't stop you either.",8
"
                Toradora's LN is a Bildungsroman done right, and its anime adaptation is spectacular. Taiga and Ryuuji are both heavily flawed characters, as are their friends, and Toradora manages to nail the pacing of their maturation. They form meaningful relationships and personalities at a rate that just feels natural and makes sense. Every arc (barring the one-episode filler arc) feels meaningful to one or more characters' development and relationships. After the conflicts and challenges during the show, Ryuuji's place really feels like some place you'd love to be. The show doesn't shy away from its simplistic goal of bringing its small cast of characters together slowly
                  over time, and that's all it needs to do. The subplots are unique, make sense, and feel (mostly) realistic and meaningful. The voice acting is passionate, the characters are unique and interesting, the writing is great. The last 6 episodes are an emotional rollercoaster that leaves you on the edge of your seat until the very end. It leaves you loving the characters and wanting to see more of them. Perfect 10 from me, as far as romcom anime goes.",10
"
                This is my absolute first review on MAL and written in English, i hope you like it ^^
So, this is the second time i had the pleasure to whatch this anime. I usually dont watch more than one time the things i really liked in the past but sometimes i make exceptions and Toradora fits in this category.
I remembered the overall feeling of happines that overflew through me when i first watched Toradora.   I loved the characters and the design, the story was pretty good for a RomCom and and the resulting experience for me was fantastic.   
I think that the
                  potential behind Toradora is hidden in its 4 main charachters.   Riuji and Taiga are the prime example of this, because they are not generic or cliched and their particular behaviors and peculiarities are gradually fleshed out throughout the episodes that follows since their encounter.  Riuji Takasu is unfortunately mistaken for a kind of delinquent type guy, but in the inner core of his hearth he's mellow and prone to help others with genuine interest.   He lives in a small house, shadowed by the towering condo owned by Ai Saka dubbed by her classmets ''Midori Taiga'',  literallty ''hand tiger'' because of her very small stature and hot-headed personality.  She too is mistaken simply by her exterior appareance, but in reality she's a bit more complex than Riuji since the origins of her demeanor will be explained later in the story.  
Then there's Kitamura, which is good friend of Riuji and something more for Taiga (trying to not spoil too much for you) .  He's a green- haired, outwardly-friendly guy who happens to have a little position of power in the school and has mostly a comedic effect to the story.   His childhood friend is Ami, which is incredibly arrogant and a bit of a pain the ass to me, but she too will soften up sometime later in the episodes.  She and Taiga are like salt and sugar and the outcomes of their clashes are funny yet very dramatic at times.
At the top of the cake, we can see Minori.  She and Taiga are like sister to each other and the love that supports their long-lasting friendship is very cute to see.  I liked very much this carachter along Taiga because she's complex too and has her motivations to the jovial and super happy demeanor that defines her, at least outward. 
These four, all togheter, are the real driving force behind the story and i completely loved them.  Yes, there are also some other minor carachters but i felt that they were not at the levels of the MC's and were introduced a bit too late in the story.  They are pretty interesting to see, even though i didnt like them so much.
The stoy is nothing too complicated and special yet its enthralling sometimes, at least for some twists that boosted my attention span and i didnt quite see coming. 
The Art is freaking fantastic.  It holds the standard of todays anime like nothing else.  Very fluid and colorful, not a single drop in quality (except for very few scenes) and its great to the eyes, at least for me.    
Music is great too, with highly sweet melodies that accompained the more ''feels'' moments and a more upbeat ones tones when it came to regular scenes.   There are 2 OP, and i liked them both.  EDs are pretty, but i preferred the OP.
Overall i gave a 9, because it is rewarding in all its aspects (characthers, art, music, story) and i can say without a doubt that IMO, this is one of the best romantic anime ever created.",9
"
                Anime in one sentence: Everyone loves best friends, but not really!
I was first recommended Toradora as something just cute and funny to get my mind off stuff and relax a little, so that's what I expected going in. Boy, was I wrong. Toradora, though it has its moments as the rom com its famed to be, actually resonated much deeper than what's on its cover. Not perfect, but still great, and definitely not what it seems.
I'll mention the most defining factors in terms of grading:
Story: 7/10
Okay so this is where Toradora gets the most criticism from me, this one anime's weakness, it's predictability. First, I
                  do understand that this genre isn't supposed to be very deep and intricate in terms of storyline but it really just takes out the enjoyment of watching something if I can literally guess exactly what happens in every episode with around 90-95% accuracy. A storyline becomes engaging when there's contrast, but Toradora kinda bummed me out there, giving me the feel of eating cafeteria food every day. What really gets me though is that the creators didn't even try when they were building the love triangle, by the end of ep1 it was 150%, no 900% obvious that Taiga was going to end up with Ryuuji. Like the whole omg ily ur best friend, no way me too thing was a good idea, but I would have appreciated less blandness.
Sound: 10/10 <3
Okay so I love, love, love op1. It was such a good song choice! At first I really didn't like it, but then as I continued to watch Toradora it really started to resonate with me and put me in the mood for the perky and energetic story Toradora is. All rainbows and sunshine there. I legit got kinda mad when op2 started, not because op2 is bad, but I just missed op1 so much. Endings are also really cute btw.
Characters: 10/10 
This is where Toradora chose to deliver its kicker, the one thing that made Toradora stand out from the rest of the rom com pack. The character choices for Toradora were so well thought out and so further developed that I only have 3 words for them, I LOVE YOU. Throughout Toradora, the main characters go through so much emotionally that it just makes them all the more human and natural. They feel like I could walk through school and see them in my class or something. Their problems are something not only they face, but what many viewers, including me, deal with in our lives. And even better, there's an unique struggle for everybody. Toradora's characters are purely human and so relatable it's easily the best aspect of what they got right. Kudos to whoever made this XD
And there you go: a rom com that's not as rom com-ey, but at the same time it's that extra spice that sets it apart. Also, any suggestions on how I can improve my writing is apprectiated, this is my first review.",8
"
                Now I have only seen a handful of Rom-coms, and I would say Toradora is one of the few that I thoroughly enjoyed! Now is it your typical high school romance story, and I say it does nail how a late teen/young adult would feel when being attracted to the opposite sex. The story does have it's ups and downs so I decided to give it a a decent 7/10, there are better ones out there. The art and sound are also your typical late 2000's animation and sound as well. (7/10)
The main cast of characters are interesting. I am not going to get into
                  any spoilers, but I would say at the beginning of the series you may have expected specific people to get together, but in the end the total opposite happens. All the characters have many unique aspects to them, and are fleshed out well as the series progressed. Watch the series to understand more! (8/10)
Overall, I would give the series a solid 8/10. It's a good introduction into Rom-com/Shonen high school romance, but doesn't go too deeply in terms of relationships with any of the characters.
I am surprised it's #14 for MAL popularity list, especially with all the negativity the series gets lol.",8
"
                Toradora! it was a great anime, despite the older art style, I can’t help but agree it exceeded my expectations!
The plot is great, I would even say it’s one of the best romance anime by far! 
There was everything, comedy, slice of life the works! Everything was pretty realistic and relatable, the feelings and emotions of the characters, the lifestyle and development of friendship I loved it!
I also really enjoyed the tiny details in the anime like note passing in class, the intense awkwardness that can be felt as a viewer!
The different personalities of the characters were also unique to their own, a tsundere, a
                  cheerful and always positive personality, a generous main character, a dense friend and one trying to portray a false personality. All these personalities change slowly as I watch the characters develop along with my thoughts on who is best suited for the MC
It is definitely worth watching!
Here is an analysis I did while watching the anime, much spoilers here but it’s the best way I can portray my thoughts on this anime!
-Spoiler Analysis Start-
So I really want to do an individual review on the main characters since there aren’t many,
Ryuuji Takasu:
-First Impressions-
Just by watching the first episode, it was already blatantly obvious who Ryuuji would end up with in a love triangle where the other girls haven’t been introduced but that’s where I had to watch more! I needed to know where the other girls will end up too!
Now, Ryuuji is a very simple minded person he had a big heart and is actually very kind! He has a very likeable personality but many don’t see that because of how intimidating he looks that is what’s captivating, rarely do we see so many different personalities in one anime!
He likes Mirano at the beginning of the anime, pretty understandable but unexpected because of the big gap between personalities but that’s probably the reason why Ryuuji likes her in the first place, read on the others to understand my take!
Yusaku Kitamura:
-First Impressions-
He looks like the typical nerd in every anime that is humble, dense and popular with girls and that he is. He is understanding and doesn’t judge a book by its cover, he was one of the first few people to get to know Ryuuji and not get frightened by Ryuuji’s intimidating looks. He and Ryuuji are the best of friends because of that. 
It was revealed that he once liked Taiga which is totally unexpected, also because of the huge personality gap! But it’s the truth
Minori Kushieda:
-First Impressions-
Minori has a very open, cheery, easy going and happy attitude. She is always very positive and tough, she does things that normal people don’t and isn’t affected by criticism, I can see why Ryuuji liked her, it was admiration in my opinion, admiration for someone that isn’t held back by superficial things like looks and is open to criticism. He admired her and fell for her in the beginning at least that’s what I think 🤔 
The first hint where Minori actually likes Ryuuji as a person was when she keeps talking to him by using Taiga, definitely a sign that she harbours some feelings toward him however it might not be that she likes him I’m not sure.
-Culture Festival Chapter-
Minorin and Ryuuji got into a fight over Taiga’s father, she knew what Taiga’s Father was truly like except that Ryuuji didn’t until later when the truth revealed itself. Don’t want to spoil too much but later on, Minorin and Ryuuji played the biggest roles that made this chapter one of the most emotional one.
That feeling I felt, it definitely wasn’t sadness No... instead it was relief and happiness when everyone made up... so much so that it moved me to a tear.  
-Christmas-
Ever since Ami whispered something to her, she began avoiding Ryuuji, she didn’t want to third wheel Ryuuji’s relationship with Taiga. And she began avoiding Ryuuji up until the Christmas party where she saw Taiga crying and calling out Ryuuji’s name where she decided to tell Ryuuji indirectly that she doesn’t want to be with him.
Kushieda then finally revealed in the final arc that she loved Takasu but felt Taiga needed him more. She really loved her best friend very much!
P.S Kushieda also has an extremely cute and energetic voice I love it!
Taiga:
-First Impressions-
Taiga is just a typical tsundere except she’s extremely violent and given her small build, it’s extremely funny! Many people are scared of her despite her build and she is given the nickname ‘Palm Top Tiger’ probably the only people that dares to make fun of her is Ami
Taiga is pretty close to Ryuuji, living next to each other, she goes to his house to eat meals Everyday and are quite good friends. 
It’s pretty understandable why Taiga likes Yusaku, probably because he is smart, somewhat handsome and has a kind face. BUT,  Yusaku liking Taiga?😂 I cannot even comprehend why he’d like her based on his reasons but that’s what makes that scene where Yusaku reveals he once liked her so interesting!
-Beach House Chapter-
So basically, Ami and Taiga eventually competed in a swimming match and if Ami wins, she gets to take Ryuuji to her beach house over summer break leaving Taiga without him while on the contrary, if Taiga wins she gets to reveal all of Ami’s private videos 
That was the first part where Taiga confessed indirectly that she likes Ryuuji with the cover that he is just her dog and has to care for him
Eventually Ami won and Taiga claims that since she owns him she has to go to the Beach house along with them, Yusaku and Minorin decided to tag along too.
Another of my favourites was when Taiga’s Father came back to visit her in which she despised him and insulted him however when Ryuuji said that his own father is never coming back and said that he felt this was for her own good she decided to listen to him and reunite with her father to get Ryuuji to stop looking so sad... Taiga really cares for Ryuuji to the point where she even reunited with her father whom she despised...
-Culture Festival Chapter-
The main focus of this chapter was obviously Taiga’s A-Holic father, ditching her when he felt like it, waltzing into her life when he felt like it and putting on a big farce to all her friends like he really cares about Taiga. HOWEVER, I felt that this chapter with the supporting character (Taiga’s dad) it allowed for the development of all the other characters and also was one of the most emotional and heartwarming chapters that moved me to a tear. 
Taiga fought the student council president Sumire over Yusaku because Sumire was hurting Yusaku whom confessed his feelings to her but did not get an answer. Sumire then began to cry and said that she wished she could be ‘dumb’ like Taiga, straightforward... Except she couldn’t because she needed Yusaku to move onward and pursue his own success and if he were to end up chasing her, she would be a hindrance. In order to not hinder Yusaku, she left his confession unanswered for she did like him yet she couldn’t reveal that.
But thanks to Taiga getting the truth out of Sumire, Yusaku overheard and everything was settled. That was where I felt Taiga was actually one hell of a girl, standing up for her friend and even to the extent of forcing out the truth from Sumire (indirectly).
-Christmas-
Ryuuji went to Taiga’s house dressed as ‘santa’ to cheer her up and she told Ryuuji to go get Minorin after which she broke down and cried when Ryuuji left as she realised she would lose Ryuuji and didn’t want that to happen. It was the first time she was truly honest with her feelings. The best part was that she began to cry unknowingly, that means that she hadn’t even realised she was clinging to Ryuuji...
-Ski Trip-
Taiga wanted to retrieve the hair clip that Minori dropped when quarrelling with Ami. She slipped and knocked her head afterwards Takasu went to look for her alongside Yusaku and Kushieda. Taiga mistakenly confessed to ‘Yusaku’ her true feelings that she was in love with Takasu not knowing that ‘Yusaku’ was actually Takasu.
That was when the dense Takasu found out the truth about Taiga why Taiga’s love for Yusaku had faltered and her reason for not confessing to Takasu.
Ryuji requested that Yusaku kept it a secret and to act like he was the one that saved Taiga instead of Ryuuji. 
-Valentines-
Minori finally decided to express how she truly felt and finally tell Taiga that she shouldn’t give up on Takasu for Minorin. Ami and Yusaku also helped set the stage for Minori to finally talk to Taiga properly which I felt was extremely touching.
Everyone was helping each other, doing all they can for their friends, sacrificing themselves for other’s happiness.
-Finale-
Minori finally conveyed what she felt, all of Ryuuji and Taiga’s closest friends, Ami and Yusaku approved of their relationship and want them to be happy. Taiga too decided to confess to Ryuuji except some serious shit happened, Taiga’s Mother and Ryuuji’s Mother found the couple and began scolding their children, Ya-Chan saying that Ryuuji broke his promise of not working while Taiga’s Mother saying Taiga would not get far by herself, forcing her to move back.
Ami Kawashima:
-First Impressions-
Cute, pretty, beautiful. Ami is a model that temporarily quit her career and transferred schools because of a stalker fan. She is known to be a cute, gorgeous, kind and sweet girl with a cute voice and a great figure however, what people don’t know is her true personality. Yes, her true personality is extremely different from her stage personality and she is actually demanding, arrogant, proud and snobbish.
She and Taiga got off on the wrong foot the first time they met and aren’t particularly fond of each other, always teasing and threatening each other. But they seem to be the type of characters that will begin to fall for the same guy and continue to argue over him or potentially become good friends but since the title states ‘Toradora’ I’m assuming it’s the argue over Ryuuji route.
-Beach House Chapter-
Ami has shown some interest toward Ryuuji whether real or fake, she teases him a lot and when Ami was competing with Taiga in the swimming competition she admits she was serious about bringing Ryuuji to her beach house and after Taiga insisted on tagging along, she secretly whispered to Ryuuji telling him there will still be plenty of opportunities where they can be alone, probably the first hint she legitimately likes him.
When they went to the beach house together, Ami looked kinda glum that Yusaku tagged along and asked him why he didn’t have to stay back with the student council 
On one of the occasions when at Ami’s beach house, they visited a cave where Ami said that she felt Takasu was not compatible with Minorin because they were far too different and that he was more suited for someone like... her
This time she looked serious, like she meant it. She also looked jealous when Takasu hangs out with the others, Taiga and Minorin.
She is definitely falling for him. But Ryuuji is just too dense to realise, even despite Ami constantly teasing and seducing him...
-Culture Festival Chapter-
A lot has happened during the Culture Festival alongside the festival itself. The main focus though was definitely on Taiga’s Father. Ami was probably not of much focus here but I sort of felt she was the only one that could really level herself with Ryuuji and understand him. I first thought that when she went to cheer him up after he quarrelled with Minorin. She also showed a lot of change in the Cultural Festival, changes in attitude, being more compassionate and understanding. That’s where I began to like Ami even more.
After the culture fest, something happened between Yusaku and the student council president Sumire. Ami seemed to understand everything while others can’t even tell what was happening. After the whole Sumire Yusaku incident, she whispered to Minorin ‘Guilt all gone now?’ Because she noticed that Minorin actually had developed feelings for Ryuuji except that Minorin did not want to confess as she too felt Taiga was best for Ryuuji. That feeling is also similar for Ami whom felt Minorin wasn’t suited for Ryuuji... Minorin felt that she was lying to her own feelings and therefore told Ryuuji that she was dishonest and disgusting when visiting Kitamura’s residence. Minorin however was also smart enough to have figured that Ami would probably have catched on when she told Ryuuji that Ami was very matured. 
The plot development is superb!
Ami is also pretty crafty and influential not to mention confident when she told Ryuuji she was the only hope for Kushieda going to a school Christmas party
It was also later revealed by Ami herself that she has developed romantic feelings towards Ryuuji when they were both in the gym facility room she said that Ryuuji should stop playing ‘father’ with Taiga, saying it was wrong to begin with as someone might get hurt, to forget all that happened and start over afterwards saying “then maybe... I could get a fresh start with you too”
Ami truly cares about her friends despite being bitchy at times she drops hints and tips on her friends, mainly Ryuuji, Taiga and Minorin trying to indirectly tell them about their situation without hurting them. 
-Christmas-
Ami predicted that someone would get hurt and someone certainly did. Taiga left to get Minorin to go to the Christmas party for Ryuuji and when Ryuuji realised Taiga left the party he chased her and tried to cheer her up in which she told him to leave and meet Minorin. Afterwards Taiga broke down and cried when she realised Ryuuji might potentially leave her life for good... Minorin saw her cry and decided to not interfere with their relationship any further and ‘severed’ her ties with Ryuuji.
Everyone got hurt.
Ami was angry definitely because Ryuuji didn’t heed her advise however, if I were her I’d also feel extremely helpless, not being able to help my friends... which I think she feels the same.
Ami has sacrificed a lot, she loves Ryuuji however she knows she shouldn’t barge into his love life and doesn’t. Despite loving him, she still hints to him who would be a better match and doesn’t try to steal him. She helps the other two girls despite also liking Ryuuji and ultimately doesn’t want anyone to get hurt. She does all this without having any ulterior motive and reward, sacrificing herself.
-Ski Trip-
Ami disliked Minorin from the beginning because Minorin was not true to her own feelings which pisses Ami off. During the ski trip Ami took a step too far and pissed Kushieda off, they began quarrelling while Kushieda just continues to put on her ‘mask’ and never revealed her true feelings at all. 
The next day they got into a misunderstanding and began fighting with each other causing Minori to accidentally drop her hair clip which Taiga wanted to fetch and return it to Minori as it was an important gift from Takasu...
In the process, Taiga fell and got injured.
Watching all the characters get along and try to understand each other, sacrificing themselves and trying to please one another, it’s heartwarming.
And to be honest, Ami would have definitely been best suited for Ryuuji if only she was given a chance.
-Finale-
With Taiga’s and Ryuuji’s decision to elope, Minori gave them all her savings from working multiple jobs, Ami gave them the key to her beach house while Yusaku gave them Rice vouchers. This was the final parting between the friends until Ryuuji marries Taiga. The sad part was that Ya-Chan (Ryuuji’s mother) ran from home and gave Ryuuji the address to his grandparent’s place where they would take him in. Yasuko was definitely the heroine of the last few parts or Toradora! She made many sacrifices for her Son, suffered so much only to have her Son call her a failure but still love him till the end.
Nothing Beats mother’s love.
And with that, life goes on. 
Takasu and Taiga became lovers
Kushieda pursues her baseball career
Yasuko plans to go to America to study
Ami continues being popular
-Spoilers End-
The anime was a rollercoaster of feelings, it was extremely emotional some parts moved me to tears like the Cultural Festival, some parts made me feel connected to the characters and allow me to understand them better like the trip to Ami’s beach house, some parts sad like when the characters broke down and cry for certain reasons and despite all that there was a happy ending.
It may not have been the ending I wanted neither was it an ending that exceeded expectations but it certainly was a fitting ending.
An unforgettable ending for an unforgettable masterpiece.
P.S the ED somehow Always fits in perfectly.

"
                It hurts to write this review, as, while selecting the votes I'm constantly like ""No, you can't score those that low!"", and then I remember why what could have been one of my favourite animes, now fills me with anger just thinking about it.
I think Toradora! is the biggest self destruction I've ever seen an anime do, and while it's not bad, what could have been a 9/10 anime has a terrible ending, which, to be fair, is just an episode, but it's the most important one, and it manages to destroy so much of what the previous ones created.
Art and Sound: They're both good,
                  but not overly so, I've watched the italian dub and I was very pleased with the job that the team did. The first opening is good, but has a terrible metallic filter all over the vocals that makes it really hard to listen to it, the second opening is solid though; the first ending is very good and is the right mood for almost every episode it is in, the second ending is probably the best track, but it's almost impossible to find it online, and I could only find covers to listen to legally. Overall solid but not extraordinaire, 7/10.
Story and Character: There are two VERY distinct parts of this anime, as I mentioned earlier: episodes 1-24 and episode 25.
Episodes 1-24 are great, they establish great characters, not terribly original, but they are very good at this tried and tested blueprint: everyone is very recognizable and deep, the social connections between the characters are sensible, strong (so strong in fact thaat at a certain point we get a love HEXAGON, and it works, because it's so tightly knit, a real treat for people who love gossip!) and always play a role in how they act, so even actions that may seem inconsiderate on paper, actually work really well, and stuff that seems strange at first is always explained in way that doesn't make you facepalm.
The plot, while starting out as a very normal high school rom-com is very engaging, thanks to the characters holding it together at first, and then it ramps up the intensity real fast after the halfway point, very few thing are casual, and character actions are never inconsequential, even the strangest stuff is explained and makes sense in the context that the series builds up; episode 24 is the pinnacle of the series, it could've been a perfect ending, filled with drama and desperate choices that make sense for the characters, it shows the trouble that comes with growing up and coming out of one's comfort zone, but that in the end you can beat your fears, and that often, a happy ending can be different from the one you expected, at this point the anime is a 9/10.
Episode 25 singlehandedly destroys everything that was have established about the characters: they try showing someone learnt something, but they show them doing the exact opposite of what they should have learned, almost everyone goes out of character in this absurd attempt at an unnecessary wrap; also, never mind actions and reactions being totally out of character, sometimes they are against every logic, and the characters don't even act like they're human!
As for the plot, it particulairly stings that episode 25 comes after episode 24, so you remember very well what can be done with this story, and you see it get completely thrashed, because what happens is so absurd and unexplable, it just looks like putting in a plot-twist just for the sake of having one, even though not all endings need one! An ending CAN be open and sartisfying. How you ask? Just look at episode 24!!! Closure doesn't need to be the final period in the story, it can be one that goes into a story that isn't the one we're telling, and that's fine, because trying to give final closure to a high school drama, never ends well! Life goes on for a  long time after high school, and if you're not going to tell the whole story, it is best to leave things open! This obviously doens't ALWAYS work, but in cases like this, where at thend the real story is merely beginning, you should either make a part 2 or stop. Oh, did I mention that there is an after credits scene that tries to solve the problems in the episode and be cute while it does it, but it only makes things worse? 'Cause that happens too.
The final episode is among the worst endings I've ever seen, it deserves a 2/10, it destroys many of the things that it built up, but the work put into the characters and story is still good, it just shoots itself in the foot and actively avoids being great, a very painful 7/10.
As for enjoyment, I was having a very good time throughout the whole series, I would've thought about giving it a 10/10, if it wasn't for the dreaded final episode: it has a great mix of relatable stuff, that makes you bond with the chatacters, and more absurd stuff that keeps you engaged with the plot, again the end filled me with a sort of primordial rage, but I had an overall good time while watching the whole thing, knocking off two marks seems appropriate, 8/10.
In the end, Toradora! is a great anime that tries its best to not be, and it sadly manages to do it pretty well, to have a better experience, I would suggest to avoid watching the final episode, as episode 24 is a great ending by itself, it hurts, but overall it's a 7/10.",7
"
                *spoiler free review*  This anime I was really looking forward to, but was unfortunately disappointed.  
Maybe it was just me, but it was hard to keep track of which characters liked who and who knew about it.  It also didn't make sense for some of them and some of the minor characters were extremely shallow.
The series started well with promise, but then got dull in the middle, then perked up again after I pushed through, but then disappointment in the ending.  The ending's ""who ends up with who"" wasn't done well and we didn't get much in the way of closure
                  for all the characters.
The music was great, and the animation style and quality was great too, but the story was just so all over the place and some parts didn't even make sense.",5

                A review in Malay!
Toradora! kisah kehidupan dan alam perlintasan usia remaja di sebuah sekolah yang berkisar di sekeliling 5 watak utama. Aisaka Taiga, seorang anak hartawan dengan masalah keluarga yang dibimbing oleh seorang rakan sebaya, Takasu Ryuji dalam menjalani kehidupan seharian. Elemen komedi romantik yang diselang-seli kan dengan kegembiraan dan kesedihan yang dilalui oleh watak-watak utama yang disampaikan dengan cara yang sangat kreatif dan asli dapat membuatkan semua yang mengikuti siri ini terasa seolah-olah sebahagian daripada watak dalam siri ini.
Penulisan skrip dan barisan seiyu yang berbakat juga telah dapat membawa watak-watak dalam siri ini ke suatu peringkat dimana penonton akan dapat merasa perasaan yang disampaikan.
Siri
                  ini secara peribadi telah mengubah diri saya dari segi pemikiran tentang kehidupan seharian.
Ini juga merupakan salah satu siri anime yang secara keseluruhan membuat saya berasa sedih setelah ia tamat disiarkan.
An anime that is worth watching again! and Again!",9
"
                This anime turned out to be much better than I expected. Actually I dropped this anime years ago after watching the first 2 episodes because it started off as a very typical romcom, I'm so glad that I decided to finish it now, the first 1/3 part of this anime is pretty typical & cliched, but after that it keeps getting better and better, episode 16 is when things got seriously REAL.
Character developments is great (both the mc, minorin, ami, kitamura, even the student council's pres and Ryuuji's mother got great development). great romantic development (It went from romcom to romance-drama) and the comedic parts
                  really got me (especially INKO-CHAN!!), I also enjoyed the music and the performance of the VAs.
Overall I really recommend you to watch this, it went from 8 to 9 imo and I should've watch this sooner.",8
"
                I just want to give you a short review so you can enjoy the Anime without reading a whole Light Novel.
First I want to mention the Characters. The Characters are the best thing on this Anime. Everyone is a unique and great done Character. I especially love that they don´t change that much and stay who they are just like in reallity. But the best thing is that everyone of them is sooo different. I don´t want to spoiler you but you might feel bad for one girl of the end and there are many heart breaking moments but it is still a great story
                  and not toooo sad. I useally dont give 10 points except for animes which are Insanelly Perfekt made for what I love. So I just can give 9 points to this anime but it might be the best romcom I ever watched because there isn´t an open ending and even if the MC sometimes (rarely) behaves in a stupid way (I think you can understand his way of acting somewhat) so he hurts others it is still great and a very reallistic story and not fantasy like how the most romcoms are. I mean something like this story could really happen in real life and even if I wish that everybody could have get lucky in the end (sadly not everyone is lucky) I still like it somehow",9
"
                (Just a head's up, this is my first review.)
Short Story: Great slice of life/romance anime with a very satisfying ending. Lots of comedy, common storyline but done in a unique way, believable characters, better than average music and art. Get past the first few episodes where it seems a little run of the mill and I guarantee you'll have a great time watching this show.
Long Story:You know there are tons of slice of life/romance animes out there, and while there are some really good ones (clannad, true tears, etc..), a lot of them aren't that great, and rely on silly gimmicks, anime cliches, or ecchi.
                  Toradora is right up there with the best. The story isn't unheard of but is done in a unique way, and you're not sitting predicting every move they make like a lot of other shows.
Story: 9/10
A tall boy and a short girl are in love with each other's best friends, and they agree to help each other confess their love. Pretty straight up story, excellent implementation. I really liked the pace that this show took, I think any shorter than 25 episodes would have left characters undeveloped, and any longer would have drawn it all out too much. The creators did a fantastic job telling the story and keeping you interested with not too many cliff hangers, but there were a few good ones.
Art: 8/10
The art was pretty good, not the best by any means, but for slice of life shows it was great. All the characters were well drawn out, and while the scenery was nothing special, it didn't need to be. Unlike Sola, which is a slice of life that relies a lot on scenery and the sky, Toradora is more character based. That being said, it wouldn't have hurt if it was a little more polished.
Sound: 8/10
Normally I find the intro/outro for animes pretty annoying. For almost every anime I've seen, I watch the beginning and ending song maybe twice, and every other time I just skip the intro and go straight to the show. Not the case for Toradora. I watched the intro and ending every time. The intro song for the first 3/4 of the anime was extremely catchy, and I liked it so much I downloaded it and listen to it pretty regularly. The second opening wasn't as great, but I liked both the ending songs. While music wasn't the key focus like in Nodame Cantabile, the background tracks were very well placed and never drew attention away from the story. However, they were rather unimpressive in score, but I understand that's not really what this anime is about.
Character: 10/10
Fantastic. For the first few episodes I found a few of the characters annoying in their attitude (Taiga, Kawashima), and I thought I knew who I wanted each character to end up with, but that quickly fell away as the show develops and explains why they act like they do. It was hard for me to pick couples out because all of the characters worked well together, if in different aspects, and I don't think any of the characters really fell by the wayside. A lot of romance/slice of life/harem animes just throw characters in because of their looks or a gimmick, even if they add nothing to the story line. Every main character and every side character in this show I felt had a real concrete purpose, and that's rare. I can't think of a single character I disliked by the first quarter of the anime, and only a few I didn't love by the end. The last scene in episode 23 was one of the best scenes in this kind of anime in that I've ever scene. The amount of emotional investment that's built up until this point all breaks down and really is heartwrenching, because you love all the characters. I watched this part over like 5 times. Toradora did it right.
Enjoyment: 9/10
Once I started watching this show I couldn't stop. I loved the character development and the storyline, and I really believed in both Taiga and Ryuuji. This show is really funny at times, such as Ryuuji taking any uncleanliness (like mold in the bathroom or unmatched socks) as a personal affront, or Minorin's kind of airheaded songs she sings aloud just for fun. Seriously watch this anime, you'll really like it.
Overrall: 9/10
The only reason I didn't give this a perfect ten is because of just a few small details added up, and because I also really like more complex animes involving intelligent characters battling it out. However, this is probably my second favorite slice of life anime next to Clannad After Story, and I think I like it more than Angel Beats, which is saying something because both those animes pretty much brought me to tears. However, Toradora, while heartwrenching at times because of the romance, isn't nearly as sad as Clannad After Story, or as nostalgic as Angel Beats. It deals almost entirely with romance, while the others focus on romance and life, which is Toradoras only downfall. If they could have stressed that a bit more, it would have been perfect.
Watch this anime, you won't regret it, it's just great.",9
"
                I genuinely cannot understand the praise this series gets. I don't watch a lot of slice of life and admittedly my exposure to the genre maybe through some of the really goods one like Kids on a Slope but this show is so frustrating because it feels like it was going somewhere good but then just heads happily into the obvious clichés. 
At the beginning I though ""hey this is a loli character that's actually not an annoying child that gets treated like an older character by everyone else"" how wrong I was... she starts off fiercely independent and kinda reminded me of Nagatoro MC
                  but by the end of the series Taiga turns out to be a genuine childish short sighted unexplainably rebellious child. The character development in this series is actually that the main characters get worse. Ryuji is fairly reliable and good natured but it seems as if he just leeches of Taigas childishness and says horrible things that then get resolved in 5 minutes in the final episode out of the blue. the secondary male character is literally just there to be there as a love interest. He has barely any character development and it barely seems like Ryuji makes any effort to work out with taiga and nor does it really seem like they're friends. 
It's obvious where the romance is going and I which the actual romance between the friends was taken seriously. Ami come sin though and is actually a genuinely interesting down to earth character that calls out the MC for his stupidity. Minori as well interesting but it never seems like she ever really likes Ryuji so the possibility of the relationship never seems to develop realistically. It just happens because they say so and feels completely unnatural. Personally I regret spending time watching this eventually turn into a trainwreck",3
"
                Hi, this is my first review and its on one of my favorite romance anime, toradora! I binge watched this anime a while back and been meaning to write a review hope this helps
Story
The plotline was extremely well developed. Initially, the story will seem to throw someone off as it seems like a mere high school drama with no true character development. However, every episode seems integral to the overall plot. The way the Ryuuji-Taiga romance ended up taking over was great. I don't think it came on too hard (as in it took away from any possible side-plots to keep the story interesting or
                  to prevent further character development), and I don't think it was too underdeveloped or rushed. The perfect mix of drama, romance, and comedy kept my eyes peeled to every episode.
Animation
As I'm not too sophisticated in this department, I'll keep this section short. My simple opinion on it was that the characters and settings were drawn very well (it fit my preference of the style of animation =/). The movement of the characters was smooth and the graphics were very high quality. Not much to complain about in this department.
Sound
The vocal acting was very good. Nothing seemed forced when I heard lines being said. I think the production company did a very good job in picking their voice actors/actresses. Everyone's voice seemed to fit. For instance, Taiga's voice had the perfect pitch of a small tough girl and that seemed to enhance her character to make it more real. The musical effects were very good too. They made the comedy that much funnier and the intense scenes that much more dramatic. As for opening and ending themes, I think lyrical wise, they suited the anime. I preferred the first set of songs (Pure Pare-Do/Vanilla Salt) over the last set of themes. But don't get me wrong, all four songs fit the anime. The change in songs matched almost perfectly with the developing love connection between Taiga and Ryuuji and foreshadows a beautiful ending to the anime.
Characters
This is where Toradora! excels above most other animes (at least of the ones I have watched). The writers definitely knew how to make their characters very dynamic. Ryuuji and Taiga provide an amazing contrast between someone who wants to see their parents as opposed to someone who would rather have nothing to do with them at all. The contrast is enhanced even more by their completely differing behaviors (Ryuuji being the super organized one whereas Taiga is very wild and messy). As the saying goes, opposites attract. That statement definitely stays true with this anime. As you learn more about the characters and their feelings, you can't help but make a connection to at least one of them. In terms of the minor characters, I have heard peoples opinions saying that the story would have been better if it was a hidden love between just the two main characters without anyone else ""interfering"". I totally disagree with this. Without Kitamura and Minori, I absolutely cannot think of a way for Taiga and Ryuuji to develop more. They needed some medium in order to influence their first meetings and continued relationship. The minor characters serve that purpose. Although Ami also seems somewhat underdeveloped, I don't think that deters much from the plot. The whole point of her being there is to be part of a catalyst for Taiga to realize who she truly is in love with. The fact that her love for Ryuuji is never properly answered isn't essential towards the plot. I think it was just there to suit her character (semi-narcissistic and craving everyone's love) and to be a sideplot that people could follow to not get bored of the main story. There is one complaint I have about one of the characters. I definitely think Minori got the short end of the stick here on development. Trust me, I am a total Taiga-Ryuuji relationship nut, but I still don't think her situation was handled too well. All the characters seems very realistic except her. I don't really see how she can be so calm and energetic after ""losing"" both her best friend and her crush. I guess the writer had a good idea going to set her straight with sports, but if that was the case, her sports-mindedness was never really emphasized. She just sort of became this person who dreamed of being a pro-softball player in one episode (sure she had talent in sports, but again, it was never really focused on as a side plot).
Overall
You need to watch this anime. There is definitely something in it for everyone. The plot was thorough and covered up all the stories that were developed throughout the series. The graphics looked amazing and the voice acting combined with music and effects gave the piece the cherry on the sundae. Last but not least, the characters were the absolute best ones I have ever seen created. Everyone can be so realistic it is uncanny. I give this a 10 overall for reaching for high standards and for its ability to capture a wide viewing audience. You may not like the lovey-dovey stuff, but you need to give this one a try. You may just find your sensitive side crying out for more! ^^",9
"
                Its 6am and just finish binged watching all of Toradora. This a great anime and highly recommend. Didn't expect to like this anime this much. This review might have mistakes because its 6am and haven't gone to sleep so just a heads up when you read this.
The first couple of episodes I felt it was slow and really didn't catch my attention but after the first four episodes I was hook. It's an anime I just had to watch straight through to find out what was going to happen in the next episode. 
The reason I don't give it a ten is two things.
                  The first one was the beginning, I thought it was slow and it didn't catch my attention until the fifth episode. The second reason is the character Minori. I really couldn't stand her character, she really annoyed me and made some of the scenes awkward. I has able to bear her character the last 2 episodes but throughout the show she just bothered me with her fakeness. Ami is a character like Minori that fakes her personality but Ami shows her true personality much more without hesitation and I am not annoyed by that.
So overall this show was a 9 and highly recommend.",9
"
                I hate how much I liked this anime and now I am searching for similar animes. 
Story: (9/10)
I would say that the whole story is pretty predictable but how they execute the story is where it shines. (NOTE: I mainly watch shounen animes, so I know a lot about predictability). The story left me wanting more and I can only say this about certain animes. 
Art: (9/10)
I really like the character design and the overall feel of the anime. It was bright and the characters felt human. Sound: (8/10)
Can't say much about the sound. Nothing really stood out to me. 
Characters: (10/10)
I really liked the characters of the show because they were very unique to me. The protagonist is very interesting. He likes to clean and very well mannered but it is still a ""kid"". The characters are well designed and unique and drove the story.
Enjoyment (10/10)
I'm a guy and I mainly watch shounen animes (YU Yu Hakusho, FMAB, AOT, Code Geass, etc).. I like my action so when my friend recommended this anime to me, I didn't think I would like it this much. The story leave you wanting more and get the same feeling the show left you. I am currently looking for animes with the same feeling. 
Overall this is an excellent anime whether you are a guy or a girl. I tend to be very manly but once in a while, you need to watch an anime that makes you feel happy inside. Give the anime a try, just watch 2-3 episodes and decide. I'm sure you will like it.",9
"
                This anime is a master piece, in my opinion the best that i have seen in a long time in its genre, comedy factor dosent stack well against giants like Love Hina but the story line will appeal to the sensitive types and those wanting to watch something that will bring back high school memories for the lucky ones that this may apply too.
It has the apparency of the typical boy meets girl starting but the story is deep for those who have experienced or hope to experience finding love the way these characters have.
Guaranteed to keep you till the series end.
Only minor is the
                  fact that there are only 25 episodes and leaves fans wanting more.",10
"
                Story (6/10)
Basically, the story revolves around our the relationships between our main protagonists: Ryuuji, Taiga, Yusaku, Minori and Ami. Ryuuji has a crush on Minori, who is Taiga's best friend, and Taiga has a crush on Yusaku, who is Ryuuji's best friend. So what's the best thing you can do in this situation? Of course it's to help each other out! And so Ryuuji and Taiga promise to lend each other a helping hand, but things don't turn out quite like they may expect...
+
; The story is structured in a way that the first half is absolutely hilarious, but the second half takes a drastic
                  turn with more drama and angst. Personally, I like the shift in tone; due to the appropriate contrast, it makes the second half seem a lot more significant.
; Of course, the story is predictable. I mean, it's kinda hard to expect a unique story from SOL anime. I do think the execution itself makes up for that, however. It's like you know how it'll turn out as, but you still want to watch it simply because you feel for the characters and are interested to know what will happen to them. That's the magic of SOL stories.
; I appreciate the messages that the anime wants to convey to the readers; it feels like a life lesson somehow. Yes, the characters make a lot of stupid mistakes, but I find that what's more important is what they have gained out of their experience. I'll talk more about this later.
-
; I feel that the transitions between scenes themselves are poor. Sometimes, the flow can go too slow, but at other times, scenes would jump from one to another. And it can get very confusing.
; There are some logical faults and inconsistencies. I'm usually forgiving about stuff like that, but they can get a little overbearing as the series goes on.
Characters (9/10)
The series does pay heavy attention to Ryuuji and Taiga, our two main protagonists, but it doesn't shaft the other three protagonists that we have either.
+
; All characters are distinctive and they have their own quirks, flaws, strengths etc... Of course, we have the stereotypical tsundere, but the development of her character makes up for it.
; Relationships have natural chemistry and you do feel like everyone is genuinely friends with one another.
; All characters are developed adequately and are relatable in a way or another.
-
; ...DENSENESS. TOO MUCH OF IT.
; Violence. A bit too much of it as well.

He's a very untypical male protagonist. Okay, granted that he's an overall very dense and silly guy (why does SOL anime love dense protagonists...) but he has other very appealing personality traits to him. He seems tough, but he actually has a motherly heart and cares deeply for the friends around him. He's OCD (pretty much), has a huge sense of responsibility etc... Despite the denseness, he's a very likable person overall.
Of course, that doesn't mean he has no flaws at all, and these little flaws come together to make him an even more sympathisable character. He does push his opinions on others sometimes. He does try to escape from situations (literally everyone in this anime does that tbh). But he's all but a teenager, and as a teenager myself, I can certainly relate to his moments of stupidity because I can be like him sometimes. And once again, that makes him all the more likable.
A lot of people hate him for being dense and some other reasons. Admittedly, I get frustrated with him because half of the problems would have been solved if he was just more straight with himself. But in the end, I still think Ryuuji's a pretty great character.
Taiga
I actually came to this anime because Taiga is a really popular tsundere and she looks ADOORABLE. \o/ Well, she reminds me a lot of Chitoge (they're both tsundere buddies after all), but a more violent(?) kind in a sense. Personally, I think some of the violence is a bit unnecessary, but what'd you expect—it's anime. The violent stuff can get out-of-hand sometimes, though.
It's just a delight to see how Taiga progresses as a character as the series goes on. She turns from a lazy, spoiled, bossy kid to someone who can actually take care of herself and even others. And so, even though I was (???) about her at first, she grew on me a lot.
A lot of people hate her for not stepping up but I think her self-denial makes sense. After all, she has always believed that her crush is Yusaku, and furthermore, she didn't have a positive impression of Ryuuji to begin with. Of course, I do think it's too exaggerated at times just to drag the series on longer, and it can be lessened drastically.
Minori
Minori's deceiving. She seems like the sun, but truthfully, no one is perfect. I don't know if going on will be considered a spoiler so I'll just stop here to be safe. Just know that her character is like a rollercoaster ride. That being said, she's interesting and I like her a lot. Of course, many people hate her for not being honest with herself, but I think it's very understandable considering her backstory and how her personality she is like. It's just very frustrating to watch as a viewer.
Yusaku
Honestly speaking, I think he has received the least development out of everyone. At the end of the day, I still don't have a full grasp of how his personality is really like... It's interesting to see someone who looks like a nerd, is the student president but is actually very sociable and popular (for once!!) He has some eccentrics and ridiculous moments but I can't say that I terribly hate him.
Ami
At the start, I really hated Ami, but she has really matured a lot as the series goes on. The whole facade thing is kinda weird to me though, because by the end of the series, I don't understand if she's still putting on a mask or not (this is probably due to the transition between scenes). It's funny how she knows everyone's feelings but the people involved are like dumb bricks who just don't get it -.-'' She's like a representation of us in a way. That being said, her vague statements are annoying (Ami, dear, dense people won't get you no matter what unless you say it straight... which is something the characters in this series never seem to do). It is kinda heartbreaking to see her put away her feelings for Ryuuji so silently without complaints, though.
Relationships
Taiga and Ryuuji's relationship is very natural, but honestly I can't imagine them doing the cheesy stuff they did in the ending (maybe because I have always seen them more as frenemies than anything?) The other characters' relationships are nicely developed as well, and it's heartwarming to see how strong the friendships between the various characters have become!
Speaking about relationships, here's a special shoutout to family relations. I feel like Taiga's family can be developed more, because I still don't like and can't understand them. Ya-chan is amazing, though; she really is.
Art & Animation (8/10)
I'm not an expert when it comes to animation, but Toradora! is aesthetically pleasing. I feel like the character faces aren't that distinctive though (Ami and Kano, anyone?) and can appear a little plain. No biggie though. 
Sound (8/10)
Again, I'm not an expert, but I do enjoy the OP and ED songs (idk why, but Vanilla Salt is constantly stuck in my head). The soundtracks fit with the various scenarios perfectly as well, but I don't think they're particularly outstanding.
Enjoyment (7/10)
It's definitely a fun ride. I admit there are times when I feel like banging my head on the table because of the characters, or times when I feel that the story is a little too draggy, but this series has successfully got me to immerse myself in the characters' stories and that's really a success in my book.
Overall (8/10)
Recommended for:
; Developed and sympathisable characters
; Adorable relationships
; Comedy comedy comedy... because who doesn't like comedy? \o/
; Its many life lessons which we can learn from the characters' stupidity. Yes, the characters can be very silly sometimes, but making mistakes is human. Making mistakes is the way to gain experience. And throughout the journey with Toradora! characters, we as the watchers can laugh, cry and grow with them. And there lies its magic.
Not recommended for:
; Lots of denseness, stupidity, and sometimes violence (do you hate dense characters or characters who can't seem to admit their own feelings? do you hate it when the female character abuses the male character? do you hate it when you are put through a love triangle-like story? if you said no, then Toradora! may not be for you)
; Its poor transition in scenes (if you hate anime where the story gets a little too draggy/goes a little too fast at times, then Toradora! may not be your cup of tea)
; Predictability
; Occasional fillers (P.S. There is one action(?) scene in Toradora if that can be considered action... but be warned, majority of the time there's no action or any fantasy-like elements)
; Are you extremely disturbed by moments of unrealism, exaggeration or inconsistencies? If yes, then yeah, Toradora! may not be for you.
All in all, I do think people should give this anime a try even if they're a bit iffy about it, because it is a really fun experience (especially for SOL romcom lovers).",8

                Ok so this is my first review so my condolences if I come across a bit stiff 
Anyway on with the review (this may contain a few spoilers so read at your own discretion)... Toradora may come across initially as a typical romance anime which in all honesty it kind of is. However there are some aspects of this anime that do make it stand out above the rest. 
Story: 7 
Personally i actually felt that the story was one of the weaker points of the anime it was cliche and not  particularly engaging you have your typical boy and girl like people, boy
                  and girl team up to help one another but end up coming to depend on one another. However despite this i do feel that the pacing of the story was better than most anime in the romance genre however it can feel slow paces toward the 2nd half of the series. To its credit however Toradora did have a complete enough finish that left me satisfied. 
Art; 8 
The art in this anime is actually quite well done, the characters proportions were always consistent that i noticed and the animation was also fluid and lively. The character design were also refreshing and no one felt to bland or generic unless they were designed to be that way (aka. Ami) There were some very beautiful scenes especially when christmas occurs within the anime it becomes very engaging and really captures the setting. 
Sound:7  
The two opening themes this anime were really well done and quite enjoyable. The OST was also quite good in my opinion and managed to really emphasise particular emotions in certain scenes. The ending themes were also good. Not really alot to say about sound, it was appropriate and well done. 
Character: 7 
Now this is where the show suffers a little bit again. The characters are relatable and enjoyable but there are often times in the anime where they just aren't memorable or don't leave a big enough impression. Its like, have you ever met someone who is extremely similar to yourself and at the beginning you really hit it off because you like the same suff and get along great etc.. but over time things become really dull and you lose that connection?. Thats basically what happens to the characters in this anime. They start off fresh and charismatic but fall into repeatable patterns that become dull and un intriguing. However one character bless her soul, Ami always offered a fresh perspective and was one of the key reasons i stayed glued to the screen despite these dull moments. 
Enjoyment/Overall: 8 
I think in terms of overall enjoyment this anime deserves a reasonable 8 it definitely appeals more to the male audience compared to most romance slice of life anime and has a good pacing that doesn't show unrealistic emotions. If you're looking for a romance anime that isn't love at first sight but is more focused on building a relationship from the ground up, then definitely check out this anime you wont be disappointed!.",8
"
                A fantastic slice of life romance anime that shows the challenges of high school extremely well.
The characters are all very likable and relateable. Toradora primarily focuses on Taiga Aisaka, a girl who’s very aggressive at times and yet kind as well, and Ryuuji Takasu, who helps look after his mother and takes care of Taiga. Everyone has their own personal challenges which are very relatable, whether it’s a first crush, or just trying to get along with your friends and classmates. The interactions between the characters are shown in a very natural and entertaining way, whether they’re hanging out at school or in a restaurant,
                  or having a heart to heart conversation.
Toradora is paced really well so it always remains interesting. It consists of meaningful story arcs which focuses on a specific character/story each. The stories told reflect their school lives and challenges brilliantly, like dealing with parents, or high school crushes.
The music is generally spot on, it often consists of a simple piano or electronic melody which compliment the scene well. Although at times the electronic sounds were a bit too overused at times, especially during the more emotional scenes.
Overall this is a brilliant slice of life romance anime about high school students.",10

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
Toradora is an incredible anime. Honestly, I don't see any flaws in it.
I think what I like the most about it are the characters. None of the main characters are that cliche who doesn't have a real personality. You can see how the characters in this have feelings, how they hide their feelings, how they have a personality. You can even see them trying to deny their own feelings as the anime gets closer to the end.
The soundtrack works. It does its job at making you feel the scenes. They're beautiful works of art too.
The story is also unique and well executed.
                  The first half makes its job at making you laugh, develop the characters and make you like them. The second half advances with the romance. I have to point out episode 19, which almost made me cry. In the end, it looks so natural and fitting to the characters the way they confessed.
You know someone enjoyed an anime when he watches it two times in a row and then goes to read both the manga and the novel. That's me. This is now my favorite anime, even though I'm not used to watching romance and usually don't like it, this one is just incredible. It's the first anime I could watch and rewatch without getting tired of it.",10
"
                *Are you a romance fan?Are you searching for top tier comedy and feels?PREPARE YOURSELF!!*
Let me state it from the beginning. Toradora! can easily be a 10 for everyone. Tho it had so many mistakes. I will mention them through my review.
Well lets start from the sounds. Toradora! has 2 Op and 2 Ed plus some classic and really heart warming OSTs. The OPs are just magnificent. Telling a story,while perfectly depicting the show and how it will evolve.The EDs have a more dramatic and inside meaning for the characters. Also there is some symbolism in them which is interesting considering its a Com-Rom.Overall, a splendid
                  job and i could say that he sounds were 9/10.
Continuing with the story and plot. Well its  A School Setting SoL Com-Rom. It's story is as simple. You just follow the to their life's and see their story. Tho its realistic enough to present that ""No school life is as simple or as normal as anybody wants and believes"".The show deliver some valuable messages and you can say its a ""Comedic Romance"" more that a SoL. This show is fast paced,can easily make you smile and knows how to set the mood. Also, its comedy its innovative and hilarious.This means that as long as you get absorbed its guaranteed that you laugh to your hearts content. Also I can say its pretty embarrassing at times , have great ironic moments and lastly  you will facepalm a lot !! ( Not in a bad mean)Being realistic the show admirably depicts that life isn't as carefree as we think it is.Life is brutal and full boulders you will need to bypass in order to achieve temporary happiness and running away isn't an option. While you live in your serene world you are unaware that other might be suffering and facing harsh situations. Such is the Message of Toradora!
Continuing with the characters which are in their last year at high school. Meaning they will soon achieve Adulthood. The character realistic each of them with their own personality and traits. But each of  them had his own problems and hardship. Featuring almost perfectly how they will react in depending on a situation and what are their weak points. All throughout thought and mildly explained.But i can tell you their hormones and puberty can be something completely bad.(will refer to it in the weakness section)
Last but not least, the art. Featuring even the slightest of details.Exhaustion?Injuries?Everything is there! Covering everything with realism and beauty! Always in complete synchronization with the mood. I mean if it was comedic and happy it would support its moe,cute or comedic faces, depending on the situation ofc the opposite can happen! It would depict that people can easily get hurt and that injuries doesn't disappear in a matter of hours. (WELL PLAYED over here, Finally something a SoL should show!)It also had its moments of symbolism which is something praise worthy.Also it contained very detailed eyes design. I call that particular design ""Dramatical Eyes"". The eyes are big and while they have a color its pupils were black. The main idea of that particular eye design style is to perfectly feature and transmit emotions. Similar shows with that eye design is School Days and a 50% of the show that want to achieve deep emotional impact on the viewer... (sorry nothing else comes to mind and im not gonna go searching for it)
--------------------------------------Personal opinion and weaknesses----------------------------------------
Although all the good points the show sadly had enough faults and weaknesses. First and foremost, the show was unbelievably predictable and ""plot"" convenient.Even if you get absorbed there is no chance that it will surprise you and that's something lacking considering it tries really hard to surprise the viewer.Additionally, the main romance going on is foreshadowed almost in every episode.While seeing this one expects the BEST EXCUSES why it went that way. How those feelings were bigger and greater than some others! But the excuses weren't the best... Just simple and convenient ones...Also,""Plot"" convenient, i refer to how the author lacked the idea's of presenting a complicated Love triangle or presenting the Character emotions and how it will genuinely make them being realized by another party ! (something like a confession, or realization via small details)Sadly, it used convenient plot devices in order to make his plot move forward which were way too cheap and like the ""Oldschool"" trick in the book of every casual Com-Rom.The motives why they fall in love and with whom are quiet weird and not well explained.(but at least there is a small excuse, barely believable tho)  The writing started good. THEN IT BECAME A WRECKAGE!Just search for its logic behind the decisions! Their motive behind some actions of the characters are non existent or even if they exist it doesn't make sense. IT was a pure impulse?? Every time? in other words bad writing was noticable and combine it with how predictable this show is, frustration is an emotion one easily awake here and not in a good mean. Also, at some point after we are aware of our MC and its problems the show slowly drifts away from that and starting to enter a side story, something like fillers, which will further explain some other characters and their problems. Well it will all contribute in towards the climax but still its was in order to explain something we already knew. Like repeating the same story twice. Like calling you a narrow minded. W/e. There were side story ""fillers"". There was 1~2 pretentious scenes. (its a minor problem but still felt like mentioning it)
Lastly, can you count as the non realistic way of characters thoughts and actions as plot holes?
Well i can. SOoo. . . there were Plot holes!! No to mention, how some characters just didn't develop or show signs of developing until something critical fell upon them. (Combine it with plot convenient devices as the ""mean"" of the critical situation it was just frustrating all over again)
Overall, I would describe it as an emotional train wreckage. Meaning it had great deal of emotions but it sacrificed objectivity in order to achieve and deliver them. But those emotions... Damn they were delivered and the show message was in a high level. I would recommend it in any Com-rom fan. Just jump in. You cannot disliked it. High success comes at high risk i guess.
Reasons to watch this:
-Top Anime show and especially Romance wise. It was a ""Complete"" Romance! (っ˘ڡ˘ς)
-Really good if you are around 16~20 years old.
-Relaxing and heartwarming. Will offer you more than a smile. Also,highly potential it will wreck you! I mean it will make you overflow with happiness and a complete feeling.
-A must watch. Also Beginner friendly.",8
"
                WOW! So Toradora, this is such a great show and it was beautifully written. It was your normal Shoujo/Tsundere anime and I loved it! The part that really ruined the anime for me was the ending though, it was a giant let down in my part and that was the hardest part about this anime. I loved Toradora up until the last 5 minutes :( but I highly recommend this to shoujo lovers!

"
                Romance will always be a difficult genre to create works in, whether it be anime, manga, movies, or any other form of entertainment. The author has find a way to create characters that are themselves believable and interact with one another in believable and engaging ways. If you use too many tropes common to the genre, the work can come off as unoriginal but if you experiment too much, the work will reach out to a very limited portion of the general audience. I have seen many people place Toradora! on a pedestal when it comes to romance and many people claim it sucks big
                  time, more than often blaming Taiga for being an aggressively annoying character. While I don't think Taiga is to blame for all of this, I definitely do agree that Toradora! fails to be a romance, while also failing to be a comedy or a drama. I find it so difficult to enjoy this anime when there are so many other anime that accomplish any three of these genres much better.
Pros
What does this show do well? The animation is decent, the art style is aesthetically pleasing, and the soundtrack is serviceable for the plot but doesn't stand out.
Cons
The comedy does not work. A majority of the jokes in the show involve Taiga hitting someone or throwing something at someone or just getting mad in general, and this gets super old super fast. I did not find it funny even in the first instance, but since comedy is subjective and maybe you have a deep passion for lazy physical comedy, then you may find it hilarious.
Is there even slice of life (SoL) in this show? To a certain degree, I suppose so. MAL lists this show under SoL, but it really is not the point of the show. Yeah, there are beach episodes and culture festival episodes and all that SoL/school stuff, but all of these typical SoL settings are more in service for ""comedy"" and drama stuff rather than wholesome SoL scenes. As a big fan SoL, it's a fairly large letdown but not really a disappointment. Go watch something else if you are looking for SoL.
The characters are the main star of the show, and all the main 5 characters (Taiga, Ryuuji, Ami, Minori, Yuusuke) fail to even act as functional characters. A major problem with these characters is that they had character traits inserted so haphazardly that it's really difficult to really care about any of them. The show is relying on the audience to connect traits or issues that the characters have with traits or issues in real life in order to develop empathy for the characters, but it should be the show's job to present and build the information critical to developing complex characters. You cannot imply all your important character development. In general, all the main characters have motivations that seem to arise because the situation calls for it or plot armor or something. The characters rely on recognizable ideas like bad parental figures and rejection to create empathy, when in reality none of the empathy feels deserved since there was no development for that. It is the equivalent of someone starting from one point and just magically appearing at the end point without having made a journey. The show tries to hide this by inserting a bunch of SoL-based settings and activities to mimic the passage of time and fake development, which makes all the characters not believable or complex to any degree. For example, Taiga acts like a whiny, parasitic, ungrateful brat for a majority of the show (up until the final episode) and the show ""justifies"" it by giving her a recognizable ""tragic"" background, which feels forced in and doesn't redeem her as a character at all. (Regarding redemption, the show just forgets to redeem Ami at all as a character, making her serve only as a source of conflict rather than being a believable character. They also ignore redemption for Ryuuji near the end of the story simply because he's the MC.) Events like this make the series feel like an anthology rather than a cohesive story.
The plot is inherently predictable. If you don't predict that the two main leads are going to get together, then this must be the first romance anything that you have seen in your life. The issue isn't with the predictability; it's how it plays out. Many important scenes of ""development"" rely on coincidental moments, which is such a cheap way to create drama. The story shoehorns dramatic events for the sake of the plot, which makes the entire plot feel unnatural.
My BIGGEST gripe with the show is that the show cannot decide what it wants to be. Does it want to portray characters that have complex ideologies and wisdom that rival Yoda or does it want to have a bunch of hormonal teenagers that don't know what to do with their life? IDK; even the show doesn't know. Does it want to tell the theme of moving forward in life and being independent or does it want to say that dependence on others is a necessary and permanent fact of life? IDK; even the show doesn't know. The show bounces between trying to be a realistic and idealistic take on dramatic romance and fails at both.
Every moment, every character trait, every relationship, and every theme comes off as undeserved. I find it difficult to even objectively defend this show because there are so many other shows that can do anything that Toradora! do better. This show is a bit old, but that's no excuse for poor storytelling that relys primarily on anime tropes and cliches. If you have a tsundere fetish, then maybe this is the show for you. However, as someone who enjoys clever humor, developed drama and relationships, interesting characters who are not annoying, and cohesion in a show, I thoroughly despise this show. I gave this show a chance, but it turned out to be time wasted that I can never get back.",4
"
                I can happily say that this is the best RomCom anime that I have ever watched. 
Although the story itself is pretty average it is the character development that really makes this anime. Over the 25 episodes you can really see the characters grow as people and by the end of the series you generally care about them. 
The art is interested. It isn't the most detailed but it is meant to make the characters look cute which it does however it also has some very pretty moments when it comes to scenery. Have I see better? God yes, but I've also seen a lot
                  worse. 
Overall I really enjoyed this and I would recommend that you give it a watch. It might not be the best anime in the world but it is one of my favorites. Also the first half has one of the catchiest themes I have heard.",10
"
                This is all my opinion so if you don't like it don't go to my comment section and bash me on it. So here it is... Here you got the MC Ryuuji and he has feelings for this girl named Minori, Then there is a girl Taiga and she like's a boy Kitamura. So Taiga and Ryuuji team up to try to encourage them to tell the certain someone their feelings. 
That was mainly the main plot for the whole anime/story. But what makes this anime great is that the writers understand what real love is... like the ""love"" Taiga and Ryuuji feels is just
                  what they want to be. And in the beginning of the anime where Taiga broke into Ryuuji's house to try to get the ""Love"" letter back is what she thinks or what she interpreted love is from the media. Also Ryuuji is the same way how he keeps stuff that resembles Minori and stuff that he wanted to give her. Then when they do tell the Minori and Kitamura their feelings they get rejected because they both see how good of a couple or group Taiga and Ryuuji make. Then u have this actress/model join and become the whole puppet master and all her scenes in the anime are well done. And so Taiga finally realizes her feelings but her heart realized first before her mind gets there. And so this is why i think this anime is really well made.
I would recommend this anime to everyone even if u don't like Rom-Coms, Tearjerkers, and Slice of Lifes. This is a great anime with a story. I didn't want to spoil so much and i could keep talking about Toradora! but i don't want to spoil more. And again don't go to my profile just to say that my opinion is wrong because its and OPINION. But i hope u found this helpful.",10
"
                Toradora! is a simple, light and delightful anime like omurice - an everyday dish that I can eat daily and not get sick of.
The story is nice and interesting since the start and I enjoyed it all the way to the end.
An anime about how a group of friends are pulled together by the red string of fate and grow together as they tackle their personal problems.
The story is sprinkled with a tinge of young innocent romance and adorned with some casual humor/ comedy.
It was a little sad towards the end but the very end still managed to put a smile on my face and
                  reminded me all over again why I'm so in love with this anime and, of course, Taiga.
I love how the characters are given depth in this anime.
They are not just any 2D anime characters that only have one main personality. They are like us - a real human being - who shows a different side of ourselves to different people/ situation.
In fact, I think I'm 80% Minorin, 15% Taiga and 5% Ami - Probably why the characters feel so real and close to me. The moment they appeared on the screen, I already know how they are like.
The story that unfolds is pretty predictable but really sweet (like eating omurice).
I enjoy and look forward to every mouth/ episode of Toradora!
Overall Rating: Great, 9",9
"
                Toradora is completely and utterly the ultimate love story. The characters are all unique, each having their own concerns and interests. The plot is well written and easy to follow, yet it refrains from abusing cliches. You will be invested until the end. The art, while nothing particularly special, retains a charming feel. Toradora will make you cry, laugh, and cry again, but when all's said and done, you will be left with a smile on your face. I highly recommend this as an entry level show to new anime watchers as well as a masterpiece for experienced anime veterans to enjoy.

                After finishing Love is War, I realized that I liked these slice of life, romantic comedies, etc animes. As I searched for high quality animes in a simmilar genre, I found SNAFU and Toradora!, and while I won't go into SNAFU, I will give my quick review for Toradora! 
Story: The story at the beginning was okay in my honest opinion, I didn't hate it, but it took a while to truly bring me into liking it. I didn't want to read into every little detail or else I would've figured evreything out from the start of the anime; it was obvious how it was
                  going to end if you put in as much as a little thought as you begin to watch the halfway point. From what began as slight enjoyment, to liking a lot, to being completely dissapointed by the ending.
Art: The art was simple, but good. Can't really complain so moving on.
Sound: While I had no issue with VA or music, there would be times where I noticed music begin to absolutley BLARE during somber moments which at times spoiled the mood of some dramatic moments. Not all the time, but enough to where I ranked at a 6. Overall it was fair.
Character: The characters in this show were lovley and I actually found myself liking them more and more as the show progressed. However, from 20-25, the characters downgraded so unbelievably much that it actually upset me. Ami for example, showed promise and was a character that I enjoyed watching along with Minori. Despite the wonderful development of her character, they killed any semblace of development and she reverted to being a two faced brat. Keep in mind I was trying VERY hard to not ship anyone in general, but I didn end up wanting Ami and Takasu to be a thing. Spoilers: They don't, if it wasn't obvious enough already, but what upset me was not that they didn't end up together, but that they had Ami show subtle hints of affection toward Taksu, but for whatever reason, this never ammounted to anything at all. Ami just ended up being mean and stuck up. While all the characters had issues in their own light, none of them were as bad as how Ami's character had turned out to be. 
Enjoyment: I tried really hard to enjoy myself at times, but felt bored throughout episodes where relativley nothing happened, but felt great enjoyment throughout the drama and relative plot. I'm not sure what else to say besides I enjoyed myself a bit, but was left underwhelemd by the anti-climatic ending and how things were wrapped up.
Overall/ TL;DR: It was okay in my eyes, it wasn't totally bad, and I can see how many people like it, but I didn't really feel satisfied with things after fininshing the anime. I reccomend to watch if you like this kind of anime, but there are other anime in the same genre that I would much rather prefer and even recommend.",4

                this anime was really something else i watched this with high expectations from all the high spoken reviews of this show and i laughed my ass off the first episode and after i finished it jesus christ this has truly completely crushed my expectation and gone way above and beyond masterly crafted story with twists turns and so good they can pull large plot twists in the first 2 episodes right off the bat and still have you enveloped in it anyway perfect balance between the comedy and the romance and serious side not too serious that youll get bored but also not too much
                  comedy that it feels like an episode of a childs show the art in here is very beautiful and still holds up today just a little bit under the triple a mainstream anime but still amazing looking which is why i gave a 9 to the art the sounds and music i am completely addicted to the soundtracks of this anime ive downloaded them and listen to them non stop i love opening 2 nice beat and lyrics characters probably half the reason this show is loved amazing characters with indistinguishable qualities and amazing unique personalities that are all so very different and i have to say i more than thoroughly enjoyed this anime binged it crazily and constantly all the time grinning like an idiot and tears shed this anime was truly a masterpiece to be shared with everyone overall i give a 10/10",10

                First things first: Toradora! is really not my kind of anime. I watched it because many people I know liked it a lot, and I wanted to give it an honest shot. If romantic comedy kind of anime are really your cup of tea, you will probably love this, almost unconditionally. Either way, it's not my kind of anime, but I still liked it much, much more than I expected I would. 
The story, to be honest, is nothing really special. It's definitely not bad, but it works. You can tell from the beginning that the characters will end up together, and there are some
                  other elements that are pretty predictable, but generally, it's not particularly cliché at all. I found the art definitely above average. Probably not one of my all-time favourites in that department, but it's still very pretty, and the art style is fairly nice.
The characters are what got me. None of them are excessively original or anything, but even the most archetypal characters (let's face it, Taiga is the definition of tsundere, pretty much exactly and all the time) get good amounts of character development that's generally relevant and interesting, and manages to not be particularly predictable while not ever being out of character entirely.
Long story short; Toradora isn't revolutionary, but I don't generally like romantic comedy-ish anime, and I still like it a lot. If it is your kind of anime, you'll probably love it. If not, well... if you're seriously considering to watch it, you probably should. Provided you give it a chance, you probably won't dislike it.",8

                Alright, let's talk bout this rlly bad anime.
Now I luved most of this animes characters, Riyuji (the main guy), the blue haired girl, and the red haired girl are rlly nicely written characters!! But let's talk bout the worst thing in this show. Taiga.
Taiga (the main girl) is a tsundere but not the rlly cute kind that everyone likes like Kagami from Lucky Star, but a rlly abusive kind. 
Riyuji does so much to help Taiga, he makes her food, he helps her with her crush, he helps her with the situation with her dad, and he's overall the only guy in anime that I've
                  seen that is a perfect, nice, amazing boyfriend.
He's so kind to Taiga and in return Taiga hits him, yells at him, and more. Their relationship is extremely toxic. He rlly should've ended up with his original crush (red-haired girl).
Because of their toxic relationship, the story is rlly unenjoyable ;<
And Taiga's design is also rlly creepy. Taiga's childlike looks paired with riyujis ""scary face"" is rlly creepy. ;<
Overall this anime is rlly bad and I do not recommend it. Cuz as someone who absolutely LUVSS the cute tsundere trope, how Taiga treated Riyuji disgusted me.
This anime is rlly bad, plz dont watch it I do NOT recommend this!! It's a waste of time!! ;(",3
"
                I am a sucker for a good romantic anime. The really good ones usually have that extra something that makes you want the characters to come together and succeed. I got that feeling here, between the two main lead. You can see who should be with who but it takes a while for them to come together and it pays off wonderfully.
On the surface you have Tsundere girl and misunderstood male lead with beedy eyes but you come to realize they are just great people deep down that hope people like them for who they are. The supporting characters are as much as part of
                  the story as the main ones, the story is clear and concise and comes together to a satisfying ending.
The twists and turns and revelation of backstory of the main characters keeps you engaged and I don't think there was an episode that I thought was filler. Plenty of funny parts, definitely worth the watch!

"
                I don't think anime in general does the romance genre well at all but I gave this one a shot.
I REALLY wanted to like this. They said this one was the best of it's genre, that it did everything all the other school-romance animes didn't do.
Well uh - that was a lie.
To get the good out of the way: 
- sound & art are all good
- the dialogue isn't the *worst*, probably on the better side then most but still could be a lot better
- the characters are probably the only thing that this show excels at. I really liked the main dude and was
                  rooting for him to win the entire time. He wasn't the sad awkward loser a lot of these shows tend to go for - he was likeable and still had areas for his character to grow in.
Now the bad:
- Like some others have said, the shows entire storyline is clear from ep3. The two main characters are trying to be each other’s wingman/woman BUUUUT like each other the whole time, what a surprise. You're essentially just waiting 22 episodes for them to actually just communicate that with each other.
- Main girl swings from likeable to very annoying from episode to episode.
- The main dudes love interest is one of my favourite characters in the show - so i was REALLY rooting for them to work out. But as mentioned above it was clear where the storyline was going so I was just getting annoyed the more the show went on. They could have at least made her not as likeable so I wasn't as annoyed in the end.
It is incredible how bad all of these shows fuck up this genre. It’s not this hard. Ugh.
Just read the episode synopsis on Wikipedia – it’s easier that way.",6
"
                I still don’t know whether I should rate this an 8 or a 9. Regardless, Toradara is a delight. It relates the incredibly common tale of high school woes and does so with a tender, patient hand, allowing us to see nuance and growth in the stories of the characters. 
With this being a romance, so much relies on the relationship between the main characters, so it’s fortunate that it’s one of the best things about the anime. Like the two MCs, we settle comfortably into the routine that they soon establish and experience every little change and development with them. As a result, we
                  understand why these characters fall in love. Their eventual feelings are not only understandable, but seem inevitable. The slow burn allows natural progression to happen.  I especially like how healthy the idea of love is here, of how it sets them up as two equals side by side, of how it encourages growth and understanding and recognizes that sometimes space and time is part of the process. It’s a love that transcends romance as well, including the friendships among the students and their shared memories, and the bond between family.   
Toradora is also extremely respectful of its subject matter. It doesn’t try to unnecessarily elevate the material, or talk down to it. It paints a realistic image of the messy, sometimes dramatic, trials and tribulations of high school students and doesn’t dress it up as any other thing.  It acknowledges that whatever these students are going through, whatever they’re feeling, matter just as they are. 
This charming, at times melancholy, anime is one I’ll be revisiting in the future.",8
"
                It's the best anime of my life. And I just love the emotion that the characters can pass on to the viewers, the voice actors showing emotion through the dub, the art, the animation facial expressions, it all just fits perfectly in the story. And the anime can show us: HEY LOOK, THEY'RE HUMANS! Despite Taiga's superhuman strength, she is still a child who lives alone and someone who needs help, affection, and care. I learned a lot from this story. For me, it's a masterpiece. The little details of the story and the personal conflicts of the protagonists and secondary characters are very human,
                  real human feelings. 
Taiga's way to be and appearance can make you really sympathize with Ryūji and make you see Taiga like a delicate little girl. If you dedicate yourself to understand this story you may well start to have love and affection for these characters. This story moves me a lot and it's very important to me, I really enjoyed seeing this anime and I love the relationship and the care that the protagonists have for each other. I got very emotional at many times during this anime, putting myself in the place of the characters. I really recommend this story.",10
"
                If you'd ever ask me ""Who is the main protagonist of this show"", I won't even take a second to think. The key character to understand the plot is Minori Kushieda. Let me explain.
Minori seems to be just another ""genki"" character. She's always bright and funny, she makes dumb puns and acts like a comic-relief. It stands so throughout the entire first half of the anime. You may say that the first 12-14 series are just a setup. I understand why viewers drop it here. Show just... tells you a story. I can even call them spoilers, but that spoilers contain some character development. Especially
                  between Taiga, Ryuji and Ami. It just goes and goes in standart slice of life manner before it hits you with the last ""festival episode"". BAM! And then there is episode number 16, which in my opinion is the turning point for the whole series. It comes with a climax that can leave a grown-up man in tears. It hits you hard not because it's something brilliant, but because it got the right setup. Not your average romantic comedy.
So back to Minori. Just look at how she changes after the festival and Yusaka episode's climaxes. The show changes it's tone (along with the opening and ending) - so did she. I don't want to spoil the show for newcomers, so just try to compare how the show goes and what happens with Kushieda. Afterall, she's the only one who loses and doesn't earn anything. She's like the viewers' indicator that reflects our mood. We want the show to proceed one way, but it takes another. And we should learn to get on with it and live our viewers lifes like Kushieda did.
So the ""Kushieda factor"" and this not so common ""setup-punchline"" (that literally punches you in the face and leaves you in tears) thing makes this one a very solid anime. It may be not the greatest of all time, it's sometimes boring and I think it has very unsatisfying ending for most of the viewers, but I personnaly would recommend it to anybody who wants to try something new. Just get through those first 13 episodes, you won't be disappointed.",9
"
                I wanted to write a review less about Toradora and more about Kawashiwa Ami.
The thing about Kawashima is that she is, to me, the female version of Hickigaya Hachiman. The way in which she does things is unorthodox, but it works. She is the only one that sees everyone completely and understands. I have a liking to Ami-chan because i feel that she is the only completely selfless person when it comes to Ryuuji-kun. 
It breaks my heart to see that she has no part to play within the group towards the end of the series. while Taiga-chan and Ryuuji-kun are obviously going to be
                  together; Kushieda-chan has the ultimate friendship of Taiga-chan and chose her over Ryuuji-kun; kitamura-kun overcomes his hardship with loving the student council president and becoming one himself (he even decides to go to America); Ami-chan is just left being herself. 
It's true that she was already past the learning curve that the characters go through throughout the series, but I would have liked to see her create happiness for herself as well. In her own way she is the most selfless character in the whole series (besides Ryuuji-kun's mother).
I think it's unfair and I understand it's just one of those 'anime-series-things' but it still really would have been very fulfilling to see her find happiness.",8
"
                A romantic comedy with a tsundere sums up the basics.  In this case, the main couple is trying to hook each other up with someone else.  Toradora is a well made show with solid art and sound design.  The comedy is well written and the characters don't stay in a trope for the entire series.  Despite that, there are funnier shows and character development isn't great.
There is one fatal flaw that kills it for me.  The ending.  Without spoilers, the ending is a big let down.  The anime is coming to a satisfying conclusion, only to veer off
                  last second.  It feels unfinished.  There is no plans for a second season or movie.  The only OVA is set in the middle, so it doesn't look like this flaw will be rectified anytime soon.",6
"
                I've ""watched"" Toradora for the first time when i was around 10yrs old, didn't understand anything and didn't even know what an anime was, i watched it just as if it was a regular cartoon, but i felt the huge difference.
At around 15yrs old when i learned about animes and started watching them, I discovered Toradora and watched it again basically for the 1st time. I loved it.
From then 7 years have passed and i've just finished Toradora for the 4th time. 
Most the times i do a rewatch i just happen to realize i was maybe too invested at the moment and not really
                  rational in my valutation, and i always find many flaws i did not notice the 1st time. This has never happened with Toradora, there's just something about the pureness and simplicity of the plot and the kindness of every character, that makes you love the show in a very passionate way. For me it's the kind of anime you find yourself thinking about after you've finished it, wishing to go back in time to watch it again for the first time.
The personal part of the review is over, now,  if you happen to step into the reviews to decide if Toradora is worth it or not, i'd obviously suggest you to watch it. I know there are extremely positive reviews (as mine is) but also extremely negative ones, but remember that taste is subjective and the only way to find out is to give it a shot, with a good mood and the right attitude (no dropping after 3 eps)
The story is linear and simple, as it should in a slice of life/romance anime, the developement of the characters is strong and it doesn't fail to convey emotions.
The music of the anime fits it gorgeously, dk what else to say.
Characters are all likeable and all with a well developed personality and a backstory.
Since it is a slice of life/romance anime, don't expect cliffhangers and please have patience, there are so many animes that start relatively slow but are magnificent if you give them the time to hit you.
Make sure to watch the last minutes after the last episode ending theme.
 I sincerely hope you can feel the same things i felt when i watched it.",10
"
                So how do i start this off. Toradora had me all over the place in a good way. It had a mix of everything you can ever think of. Toradora is one of the first anime's  that made me cry not because of any deaths but because of how things where put into words and feelings from the characters. And you feel like your connected to them. And it makes you think about your own life and you start to realize things you usually dont. And this often comes with really good Animes. So overall this was just Outstanding and believe it deserves a
                  season 2 like most anime",10
"
                This is a review/rant I wrote half lucid at 1am in a discord dm. It is likely riddled with spoilers (and spelling errors) as I am very critical of the show, though I do not remember the point by point contents of the review. If this is your favorite show, I am glad you could enjoy something that I could not.
Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers
executive summary:
toradora is a show about ryuji and taiga. it is a love story, though the word ""love"" can only be used here in the loosest sense. At the start ryuji has a crush on minori (taigas friend) and taiga has
                  a crush on glasses (ryuji's friend), they team up to wingman each other and over the course of 25 episodes, they predictably fall in love with each other. Toradora does the best that it can with what it is given, executing as well as possible a character driven narrative with some of the worst and most unbelievable characters ever written. While the existence of a clear end point sets it above most romantic anime conceptually, the poor characters and reliance on anime tropes brings the experience down considerably.
Taiga:
being the main female lead of the show it is extremely important to understand taiga's role in story. On the surface, you might think that taiga is a psychopathic baby, lashing out with physical violence at everyone around her, but there are hidden layers here and as you delve deeper into her character you will learn that you were right the first time. In episode one, taiga assaults ryuji with a sword over a small (both sides at fault) accident. multiple times taiga lunges at him with intent to kill, nearly missing as the sword goes through the wall behind him. Keep this in mind for the character development section. This sets the tone of her character immediately, she is even called the palm top tiger at her school because of her unabashed violent tendencies (everybody is scared that she will hurt them). It is later revealed that taiga has extremely wealthy parents (likely paying off the school to keep her from getting expelled) who emotionally neglect her, causing her to lash out. This is a take on the ""tsundere"" trope in anime where a female character will physically abuse someone that they like and for the most part it is a better depiction than most because there is an actual reason for her psychopathic tendencies. it should be clear that this in no way excuses taigas behavior. In real life, if taiga were to murder someone (like she tries to several times) her ass would be in jail faster than she could say ""rough childhood"". reading several message boards about this show I have found out that taiga is many people's favorite female character and that they find her cute. I hope these people consider what interacting with this person in real life would be like or if the genders were reversed. When she isn't assaulting people, you can actually feel bad for taiga. The episode where her dad came into town just to abandon her hit different right up until the next episode where she assaulted someone again. This is a common trend in taiga's arc. I do not know if the writers thought it improved the story or if they thought that people would get bored without it, but these frequent bursts of rage stopped being shocking or interesting after around episode 8 while still maintaining my disgusst with the character. This, however, is merely the base of taiga's character. I know that I am going pretty deep into why I dislike taiga, but it is important for contextualizing the show. 
Taiga can't do anything on her own. She's a rich slob who demends on ryuji for all of her basic and emotional needs. If the tone and delivery of the story were any different, it could be considered an anime adaption of Bong Joon Ho's 2019 masterpiece Parasite. It is not an exageration to say that ryuji does everything for her. he makes her lunch, cooks her dinner every day, cleans her house, and performs all the emotional legwork for getting her asking out her crush and all of her moments of rejection. Ryuiji gets very little in return with taiga not even being all that helpful in trying to get ryuji a date.
If you had read this character description before watching the show, you would think that I was describing the most awful character of all time.You would be right. Taiga is a violent, sociopathic, self centered, rich slob who barely progresses as a character throughout the 25 episodes. To top it all off, any character development that she does have is aimed towards her accepting herself and not on personal growth. Taiga is my least favorite female character of all time and it pains me that so many people hard disagree.
Ryuji:
being the other lead of the story, it is also important to unnderstand ryuji. While not nearly as bad as taiga, ryuji himself isn't amazing. He is a submissive coward who cannot be honest with himself or others; he isn't violent though, so he is already beating 31 thousand people's favorite character according to my anime list. He lives with his single mother and pet parrot. He does all of the cooking and cleaning in his household because he wants to make his mothers life as easy as possible. Ryuji also doesn't get any real character development. 
Other characters:
toradora has 3 main side characters. Minori (ryuji's crush), glasses (taiga's crush), and Ami (just a friend). Minori is an overly energetic bubbly sports girl who seems fine at first glance. My only real problem with minori is that she consistently makes decisions that real people wouldn't make. She sabatoges herself multiple times in a weird sort of emotional martyrdom because she is convinced that taiga has a crush on ryuji (in the end this becomes true, but she does this far before it has any basis). Despite talking more than any other character in the show, she lacks the communication skills to keep this show less than 6 episodes (like it should). Glasses is almost not a character. He shows up from time to time to subtly reject taiga's advances (just like minori does) without actually resolving the issue. He has one episode about him about halfway through which leaves him a broken mess. The slutty santa bit he did was also equally parts amusing and alarming.
Ami: 
ami is the only character in this show (other than ryuji's mom) who is likeable. Ami is a slightly vindictive model whose main arc gets resolved quickly and then sticks around to drop truth bombs on the cast. She is the only one who is truly aware of what's happening and consistently hints that there could be a more interesting dynamic involving her character, unfortunately there never is. Toradora largely treats its side characters like merely objects for the plot and will cast them aside for long stretches of time until they are needed again. This would be fine were it not a character driven show. These characters could be made a lot more interesting if they didn't just exist to push taiga and ryuji together.
relationship and character development:
They gradually fall in love with each other. This is predictable but its not really a bad thing. What is bad is that it idolizes an incredibly toxic relationship. Ami points out about halfway through that ryuji has taken on a fatherly role to taiga. As I thought about it I realized that she was correct. He cooks, cleans, console her to the point of dependence on him. This is pretty gross behavior. In addition to the parasitic relationship previously stated and the physical violence, this is not a relationship that should be idolized and the smoothbrains in the crunchyroll comments section should feel ashamed of themselves. By the time they are ready to tell each other how they feel, every girl in the cast is inexplicably attracted to ryuji, so the writers manage to cram the harem trope into this one as well. They decide to elope the moment they start dating which is a... decision the writers made. they ended off the ""love"" story with a failed elope attempt (finalizing in taiga skipping town), effectively blueballing both the audience and ryuji. At this point they do something morally unforgivablewhen they flee town they yell at the mother, call her a failure, run away, and then tell her that ryuji died, forcing her to reconnect with her family that is ashamed of her. any of these things would be terrible but they are so smug about doing it. villanous actions that taint the entire ending. Ryuji doesn't really progress as a character here, actually becoming worse with this action. He is still the same coward he was at the beginning, just this time with a girlfriend. taiga is the same violent maniac she started the story as, just with less emotional baggage
overall toradora is a character driven show with bad characters and nothing can change that. Watch this if you dislike yourself, healthy relationships, or just have a fetish for pain. 
score: 4.5/10",4
"
                Okay. This is my first review. So be easy.
I've seen Romantic Comedies before. (Not just anime, yes I watch live action) And out of all of them, this just might be my favorite. 
Story-9: This show gave me a very big variety of feelings. The first couple of episodes were good enough and it would have landed it at a solid 7, but it later picks up the pace, and makes you curious what development happens next. I had this on hold for a while because I didn't see so much potential in the show. The story is great for the remainder of the series,
                  although the ending is a bit quick, it ends with my interest still intact. 
Art-8: Not too much to say as the art is pretty good, although at some points, it can be considered below standards, the animation isn't bad. Though this isn't such a huge factor, it still was good for the most part.
Sound-8: The OST of this show has feeling and shows the struggle between characters. The moments when the soundtrack comes in at the right moment just blows me away and makes me feel how emotional or romantic this moment is.
Character-9: Now this is one of the points in the show that give it it's praise. The characters in this show are very enjoyable, and have personality. It isn't a huge cast so the characters can flesh out. The chemistry between them is also pretty great. When it comes to the best character, I'm gonna go unoriginal here and just say Taiga. She is easily shown as a tough person with troubles. She also has a great personality that is likeable. The rest of the characters, though I won't go into detail, are also great and give me enjoyment.
Enjoyment-10: I'm not exaggerating here. I genuinely enjoyed the show this much. The mixture of these things just factor into a great show and I felt good watching this as it was something that just made me excited whenever I got to watch another episode. And if I enjoyed it, then I enjoyed it. It just happened to give me full attention and I stuck with it.
Overall-9: In all fairness, this show is great and deserves this high of a rating. Maybe even higher. This show felt like a romcom done right, and it deserves praise for being like that.",9
"
                Oh man...  I really love this show. 
I really thought that this was a well written, fun, heart-grabbing show. “Toradora!” Will grab you instantly, and if you don’t fall in love with Taiga within a few seconds then I don’t know, man. You might be a lost cause. Taiga has to be the cutest, most stubborn, girl ever. I very much enjoyed watching her grow every episode. Even though she has her faults, you just can’t help but love her even more for them anyway. Yet another anime that I just couldn’t find anything wrong with, and I really try my best to be
                  very analytical and tough on every anime that I watch. This anime really is unique and very, very special.
Do yourself a favor and watch it. Then rewatch it again, and again, and again...",10
"
                I love slice of life/romantic/comedy anime's but good grief this takes the cake. This was absolutely beautiful. I was a little iffy at first, cuz all I could think about was how the main character (Ryuji) would probably end up hating or falling in love with the main character (Taiga). It did eventually happen, but in the most hard-felt, troublesome ways possible. There was quite a love triangle, even a love square for a little bit. But the episode in which the class president leaves, really changed it all. You know, I felt like the show was at least decently light hearted up until that
                  happened, then it changed so drastically. I was so conflicted about who to root for most of the time. But in the end, I was so happy with how everyone felt and how great it became. I was so surprised by the end, and kinda hurt by it. I wish it hadn't finished there. I would've enjoyed just one episode of at least them struggling to start living as adults, but I also understand why they should leave it there.
Music: I really liked the music of the intro. It was spunky, and had it's own attitude that really fit Taiga. Then it was interesting to watch the intro change as the characters and story developed. And same with the outro. The soundtrack was good, and there weren't too many gasps. I truly thought the sound production was amazing.
Characters: It was BEAUTIFUL to see the characters' develop over time. They didn't just change over night, in one episode, but slowly over multiple episodes. And I guess that's really how it is. Changing slowly over time. Thats truly how people are. They don't change over night. I loved how every single character had their own unique personality, and they all played a key role in the events. Yet how each person had their own secrets too.
Story: I was really worried about how this might be kinda boring at first, as it didn't seem to pick up a lot of traction at first. But after a while, it really grew like a snowball going down a hill. It just became bigger and bigger and bigger. There were many developments, and I loved how everyone at first was afraid of Taiga, but everyone loved her by the end. It was truly fantastic. I absolutely loved how this show grew and what it became.
Overall: I would have to say that this was truly an amazing anime. I loved every second of it, and it's sad that I could relate so much to Ryuji and his cluelessness.",9
"
                By far one of the most adorable and romantic shows I've ever seen. Definitely worth watching the whole way through. 
The characters are great and lovable. 
This anime does not follow a clique love/romance anime. 
Hilarious and more comedy than romance at first but the show does slowly transition into the romance genre.
There are many memorable and tugs at your heartstrings occasionally.If you are interested in a person, you can definitely relate to many different situations the characters are in, especially the two main characters.
I do believe the anime does deserve a high score.
Overall an awesome and lovable anime and you should consider giving it a watch. If you are a fan of comedy, romance, and a lot of heart-tugging scenes, I would HIGHLY recommend 10/10 would watch this again",10
"
                Oh!
So first, it's love comedy, but also more on the drama side of things!
The characters, I felt, start off really weak at first.
The MC is just typical MC except ""nobody likes him because of his mean glare"", but that's just a one-off in ep 1, after that, he's a totally normal guy. Or, well, a totally normal protagonist who is super good at cleaning and nice etc, you know.
The female lead is super tsundere.Another female is just mean. xD A third, overly happy. Etc.
Several characters just seemed like terrible people, or at least, people I could never get along with.
But, they do get a lot better later on, for each character, it gets explained why and how they are who they are, which was nice to see.
More than that, I really enjoyed just watching the characters through their school experience, going on summer vacation, the school festival, a Christmas party, and so on. It really felt like a completed experience, and it gave me nostalgia. xD
More than anything, I wanted it to continue, but I also knew that it couldn't be like that.
So, at the end, there is a confession, and it's nice and it's obvious. But it's not so much about the confession, more about the journey there, and it was a good one.
Another thing I liked, is how they took some issues that are semi serious, such as being small or having small breasts while young and at school - stuff that is really uncomfortable and can easily lead to being bullied - and actually treated it with the respect that it deserves, touching upon the anxiety and whatnot, as opposed to treating it like a recurring joke.
The music was really good. The art was fine. Well, it was very slice of life, what do you expect. :D In fact, sometimes, the animation went out of the roof for some reason. There even was a random epic anime fight at some point, kinda out of the blue. xD But kinda nice.
There were a few weird moments. I don't understand some characters still, or why they did what they did, or who they're in love with. I don't understand why some characters ran away at the end, multiple times. But that alone won't deduct too much from a very enjoyable, solid, well-rounded experience. ^^",8

                Toradora! is one of the staples in the romance category. And there's a good reason why.
The story in itself isn't too interesting, it's a fairly generic romantic high-school setting, with an ultimately very predictable plot line. This doesn't really matter a whole lot though, as the entire experience is carried by the amazing cast of characters. Both our main characters and the supporting cast have genuine personalities and they truly improve the story a whole lot. You can relate to them, feel with them, and in the end you genuinely care about the outcome of the story, if only for the characters themselves.
The sound and
                  art are alright, and they fit the genre pretty well. The first opening is pretty good, but the rest of the soundtrack is rather forgetful. 
Overall I'd say that this is a definite must-watch if you call yourself a watcher of the romance genre, if only for the interesting and intriguing characters. Other than that, the show itself doesn't really have anything interesting to offer, but the characters alone make it worth your time.",8

                Toradora is to date one of the romances I still give high praises to and being my current second favourite romance just behind plastic memories. this anime allows you to follow both characters throughout the 25 episodes which gives you alot of time to connect and know more about them, the story writing is very exceptional when handling Taiga and Ryuuji since they both start off liking other people and try to help eachother get with those people which evidently doesn't happen. The characters you're introduced to are simple, entertaining and likeable and keep the show entertaining. throughout the anime you see the development between
                  the two change in a natural way and to a degree where you're supporting both of them.
If you like rom com animes which are between teenagers in school then this is worth watching.",9
"
                WARNING. SPOILERS
I have a bit of mixed feelings about this anime. i hardly watch anime (i dont have the time) but i was really upset about how slow the romance moved and then suddenly with the last two episodes they are literally just like ""Hey! We hugged like one time so lets run away and get married!"" and i was just like ""...WHAT.""
But of course they give you that oh-so-necessary kiss in the last episode or so, and so all is well. But really the rushing was not appreciated.

                Toradora! (Don’t forget the exclamation point. That also means I need to yell it every time!) Is a romantic comedy anime-adaption of the light novel by the same name written by Yuyuko Takemiya in 2006. Toradora!, in basically all Its iterations, did extremely well. So well that in only 2009, only 3 years after it’s release, the light novel had sold over 3 million copies in Japan. Just like the work it spawned from, the Toradora! anime did exceptionally well. It’s also incredibly well-known to the point where if you have any experience in anime, outside of the super mainstream stuff, you’ve probably at least
                  heard of it. It’s become somewhat of a household name for anime fans. I watched it for the first time around 5 years ago or better. Then I heard of a Toradora! Christmas Rewatch some fans started. You start watching it on December 6th and watch one episode a day until you finally finish it on New Year's Eve. People don’t just watch it around Christmas for no reason, though. One: It’s all about love, and Christmas is the perfect time for all that cheesy goodness. But the second reason is that almost the entirety of the latter half of the anime takes place around Christmas and Winter. It’s a surprisingly big part of the show. That’s why the Toradora! Christmas Rewatch happens. I decided last year to take part in it. Then I decided this year to do it again. Long story short, It’s turned into a Christmas tradition for me, and I wanted to talk about it. Of course, I didn’t watch one episode a day this year like I was supposed to because I really wanted to get this out by Christmas Eve. So, I didn’t do it right this time. Sue me, I guess. 
Ryuji Takasu is a second-year student in high school and a complete and utter delinquent that terrorizes everyone in sight, or so people think. Ryuji is actually the opposite, a very caring and kind person, who happened to get the scary eyes of his father. Eyes that not only cause people to run from him but also give him all their valuable possessions for no reason. Despite his eyes, Ryuji wants to live a normal life full of happiness and love. Working on both of those things, he has a crush on Minori Kushieda, an energetic girl in his class. He looks at her like a ray of sunshine and optimism that could rub off on him. After talking to her, if nervous grunts and saying a name count as talking that is, he walks away to collect himself when he’s suddenly stopped by a strange invisible force in the hallway. However, as Ryuji looks around he noticed it isn’t an invisible force at all, but instead Taiga Aisaka, a short girl that’s become notorious around the school and has garnered the nickname of “The Palmtop Tiger” for her short appearance and even shorter temper. Ryuji, now with the snot thoroughly beaten out of him after his run-in with Taiga, returns home and discovers a pink envelope in his bag that seems to be a love letter. Ryuji holds it up to the light and notices that there’s no letter at all. Just an envelope. It was from Taiga, of all people, and meant for Kitamura. “What a klutz”, Ryuji thinks as he goes to sleep. Shortly afterward, noises can be heard from the house. Was it a ghost? Was there a thief? Was somebody trying to make Ryuji’s poor household even poorer? What monster would do such a thing? Turns out “The Palmtop Tiger” herself, Taiga, would as she breaks in with a wooden katana. Fortunately, she isn’t there to steal Ryuji’s possessions, but instead to kill him. Wait, wouldn’t that be worse? She does this in a fit of embarrassment-fueled rage that’s a danger to everyone in sight. After realizing she had forgotten to put the actual love letter in the envelope, Taiga spares Ryuji’s life for another day, just as she’s about to behead him. The two eat a meal together because that’s what you do with an intruder who attempts to kill you gruesomely. Taiga is noticeably upset at the whole ordeal and to make her feel better Ryuji shows something even more embarrassing. Ryuji’s box for his crush. Filled with love songs for her. Filled with mixtapes they’d listen to on the road in his fantasies. All sorts of creepy stuff that would make somebody get a restraining order. Taiga discovers her friend, Kushieda, is the girl Ryuji likes and is repulsed. Ryuji, fed up with his intruder, tells Taiga to leave the house and bribes her to do it. He agreed to help her get closer to Kitamura if she would just leave his house. She agrees and eventually, Taiga helps Ryuji get closer to Kushieda in return. And so the love square about two people trying to set each other up with their own friends begins. 
Toradora! is a rom-com and regardless of how you feel about the genre, I think we can all agree that the holiday season is the perfect time for it. Toradora! does a great job at being a rom-com and what I mean by that is it‘s a perfect blend of both romance and comedy. Sometimes a series might be more on the romance side and completely forget about humor, or you might have something with so much comedy it manages to drown out any weight the romance is supposed to carry. Toradora! doesn’t have either of those problems. It will have you invested in the drama and laughing a minute later, very seamlessly I’ll add. The comedy isn’t only there for humor, but to also break the tension of some of the serious moments. If something starts to get too heavy, a joke usually lightens the mood. Toradora! is very good at blending these things together. Neither of them cancels each other out, they support each other instead, as a good rom-com should. Another thing that separates Toradora! from other rom-coms is how it handles its subject matter. Toradora! is about a group of teenagers ultimately trying to find love. Not a groundbreaking story by any means, but what is unique is how it doesn’t focus only on the happy, joyous parts of romance as you may expect. In fact, I’d say, above all else, Toradora! focuses on the negative parts of love and the pain and sadness it can bring along with it. Fun for Christmas, I know. That’s not to say it won’t have you saying “awwwww” at your screen as you smile like an idiot, that will certainly happen, but you’ll have lots of moments that make you truly realize the weight of what these characters are doing. It’s a bunch of kids trying to find love and unintentionally hurting other people along the way. They all want happiness, but that happiness conflicts with each other’s happiness. Not everyone can be happy. Someone will get hurt. That’s what Toradora! focuses on and it’s not something I see being the main focus often, especially in the genre. The characters reflect this more serious and realistic look at love as well. Toradora!’s characters are flawed. They are fake. They were masks. They hurt people, be it intentional or not. They are selfish at times. They are irrational. They think they know what’s best for each other. They are indecisive. They can’t figure out what they want for themselves in life. They are all of these things and more. That isn’t because they are poorly written, or unlikeable even. In fact, it’s the opposite. Again, Toradora! is about a group of teenagers that try and find love. Love is messy. Being a teenager is messy. Put these things together and you get an even bigger mess. All of the characters are trying their hardest to be the best they can be, but sometimes they trip up. Maybe that hurts someone. Maybe their indecisiveness causes problems for others. Maybe their meddling in on their friend's lives hurt each other, rather than helping. Sometimes in trying to figure out who you are in life, you may try different things, wear a mask, be different than normal. Maybe you learn that that mask is the only way you can survive. It’s a very difficult time in anybody’s life and the characters in Toradora! reflect that perfectly. None of the characters are bad people, by any means. They may be selfish and they may hurt people, but that’s not their intention. They’re trying to find the best way to make everyone, including themselves, happy, and in doing that they start to learn that it’s an impossible task. No decision makes everyone happy. As painful as it may be, what makes you happy, may hurt people you care about. It’s hard. The characters make mistakes because it’s hard. Toradora!’s characters just want happiness, but along the way, they learn that that happiness comes at a price. Do you claim your own happiness at the cost of someone else’s, or do you sacrifice it for theirs? Another big theme of Toradora! Is misconceptions. Having a preconceived notion you believe in so strongly that you refuse to look at anything else. Do you ever daydream and get your head wrapped up in an idea? I think we’re all guilty of getting lost in our heads at times. There isn’t inherently anything wrong with dreaming about something or imagining an ideal situation, you can do that just fine. The problem lies with not realizing what’s around you because you’ve blinded yourself by your “Ideal” vision of your life. You can want happiness and want love, but if you get so wrapped up in your head about what those things are and how they’re achieved, you might not even realize when those things are staring back at you. They may not look the way you imagined, but they’re still there all the same. Taiga and Ryuji as our main characters are lost in their misconceptions. They’ve blinded themselves by their own “ideal” love and only when they can see past that, do they become happy. Ultimately, they both want to love. They want to love and be loved, but they want to love themselves most of all. They don’t love their flaws, so they choose a partner that is their “ideal.” One that will rub off on them and maybe even get rid of their flaws. They believe they can’t love themselves with their flaws so they try to erase them. When they should be finding someone who will accept their flaws and help them grow past them instead. But unless they stop blinding themselves and get rid of their “ideal”, they’ll never realize that their happiness has been staring them in the face the whole time. Every other character realizes this, some of them attempt to help them see. Some may try to mess things up for their own selfish wants, but everyone can see, even the audience can. Everyone except the two who have blinded themselves. 
Toradora! Tells a beautiful love story. A love story that wasn’t only brought to life by the characters and plot itself, but also by the art and music. When it comes to art, It looks good. Now, going on 12 years old, which is crazy, Toradora! still looks fine. Looking at it, you can tell it’s older, but not quite 11 years old. It’s aged pretty well, all things considered. That’s fine and good, but what I wanted to talk about art-wise is less about how things look, and more about how things are presented to us. More specifically how Toradora! manages to tell parts of the story without words and only with the characters' emotions. Some of the most iconic moments of Toradora! In my mind are when no words are spoken at all. There are many examples in Toradora! where the art does such a great job of conveying the emotions of the characters. Such a good job, that something as simple as a weak smile or a stare that lasts for a few seconds has the power to convey far more feelings than anything else could. It’s hard to really go into specifics without spoiling parts of the story, but there’s raw emotion in the characters, and that’s something that Toradora!’s art does a fantastic job at showing. To give a very vague example, there's a part near the end where emotions are running high and one character grabs another's hand. They struggle to wiggle their hand out but can't and eventually accepts it and holds tighter. Such a powerful scene with few words spoken. It only lasts for a few seconds but is beautiful. It’s one thing to have a good story and raw, emotional characters, but it’s another thing to be able to properly convey that in every aspect of the anime, even the art. It deserves to be commended. When talking about music in an anime, most people’s thoughts usually go directly to the opening and ending songs. It makes sense. They’re usually quite good and easily the most recognizable tracks. You also hear them the most. Toradora! has some decent ending songs with some very good openings. Now, music is subjective, like most things, but I really enjoyed the openings a lot. Not only because of the songs, but art-wise as well. The first opening song is very upbeat, crazy, and fast pace. It reflects what Toradora! is very well. The opening depicts all of the characters just hanging out and having fun very lightheartedly. It fits the show, especially the first half of it. Then you move on to the second opening that plays for the last third of the show. The characters are all depicted as more distant from each other. The lightheartedness is almost completely thrown out the window in both the song and animation. More stress is visible. Things are reaching a boiling point. Only to have the last part of the opening, be all of the characters gathering together laughing and smiling at the camera. It’s very reflective of what Toradora! is. A group of friends that care for each other, but hurt each other. No matter what happens, or how distant they become, they return to each other because that’s what you do when you care about someone. Endings are less symbolic. It’s mostly just like “hey you haven’t seen the characters smile in a bit. Here’s some happiness” or at least that what it feels like in the latter half of the show. The rest of the OST is good as well. Kind of has this cheerful vibe that makes you in a good mood. Not quite “I’m going to run a marathon” levels of upbeat, more like something nice to listen to while you get some chores done around the house. There is one song that if I didn’t mention, I’d be hunted down for, however. That song is Lost My Pieces. Lost My Pieces is gorgeous. It’s such a gentle and calm sounding song. So gentle that it almost sounds like it will break if it’s played too loud. It’s both beautiful and sad, which is reflected in the moments it’s played. I listened to it, not only when writing parts of this, but other Christmas projects I was working on as well. It’s the perfect song to curl up in front of a fireplace on a snowy day with some hot chocolate, if I had any of those things nearby, that is. It’s still great without those things. It’s not often that a song of that isn’t the opening or ending song gets so much recognition. It without a doubt, deserves it. There, I mentioned Lost My Pieces. Don’t come after me.
I wanted to use the end here to talk about the possibility of a Season 2 of Toradora! Don’t worry, I won’t spoil anything. So, should there be a season 2? No, I don’t think so. Don’t get me wrong, would I get a big sense of joy to get to watch these characters again? To watch them be brought to the modern era? To watch their lives continue? Of course, I would, but even so, I don’t think I want it to happen. Toradora!, unlike way too many series, has a perfect ending. I hesitate to call anything perfect, but the ending is certainly close. It’s an amazing pay off after watching the anime, especially the more emotional stuff later it on. All the stress instantly fades away at the end. Everything feels whole. It all feels as it should. I don’t want a season 2, simply because I don’t believe it could live up to its prior season. Toradora! is a beautifully wrapped anime from beginning to end, that is complete with the incredibly satisfying ending. The ending is part of the reason, I come back to rewatch it. I know that at the end of all my emotions, I’ll be able to look back on Toradora! very fondly as an anime that can put my emotions through the wringer while warming my heart all the same. I love Toradora! the way it is, for what it is, and I believe many, many people would. I loved rewatching it each time I have, and I look forward to loving it again next year. Toradora! truly is special. I’d highly recommend you check it out. As always, I think you should experience Toradora! for yourself. After all, this was just my opinion and it isn’t any more or less valid than yours. Seriously though, watch it. More than anything I’ve recommended to this point. It’s good. 
And I'd appreciate any feedback on how I could make these better. I’m still very much learning. Even though I’m satisfied with how this turned out, I can always improve and I want to. Feedback of all kinds is appreciated! 
I wasn’t exactly sure where to mention this without disrupting the flow of everything so I’ll put it here as a bonus for reading through what I wrote. If you did, I appreciate it. Thank you, really. I had a blast working on it and this project in particular really meant a lot to me. I wanted to talk briefly about the origin of the name Toradora! because I found it interesting. It isn’t just fun to say, it has meaning, and not meaning that’s hard to understand outside of the culture. It’s a simple, multilayered name that I found really clever. It just requires a bit of explanation to understand. So the tiger and the dragon are two big symbols in Chinese lore. They’re two incredibly different powers, yet similar all the same. They usually represent a balance of power, like Yin and Yang. I mention this, because in Toradora! this tiger and dragon theme is explored. Taiga Aisaka is the tiger and Ryuji Takasu is the dragon. They even make mention of how they’re connected by fate, like in Chinese lore. They’re even given nicknames relating to this. They’re two wildly different, but similar powers, like the tiger and the dragon. Now, how does this Chinese lore fit into the name? Well, “Taiga” is the Japanese pronunciation for the English word “Tiger.” Another word in Japanese that means “Tiger” is “Tora.” That's the first half. Ryuji is the second half. “Ryu” is a word in Japanese that means “Dragon.” If you take the Japanese pronunciation for the English word “Dragon”, similarly to Taiga, you get “Doragon.” Knock off the last syllable and you get “Dora.” Slap them together with an exclamation point to add some excitement, and you’re left with Toradora! Toradora! means multiple things. It means the tiger and the dragon and by association, Yin and Yang. It also means Taiga and Ryuji, our main characters. The name means two sides that can’t exist without each other. Light and dark. Two sides of the same coin. A balance of powers. It represents two wildly different, but similar people, who are connected by fate itself.",10

                Sorry everyone who will say ""BRO YOU ONLY GAVE IT 10/10 BECAUSE ITS THAT AFTER YOU FINISH A GOOD ANIME HYPE"". Okay I just finished the show today, tried to drag it and finished it in like 2 days, and started to watch the first episode a few minutes after finishing the show. Yes I liked the show maybe because I'm young and I miss my fun High School days that could have been better. Maybe I am not married so I want to find someone to share myself with and maybe just maybe I feel bad for some of the things I did or
                  didn't say. Yes thats very personal and may even drag you away from this show. I found Toradora! by acccident (well not really because googles algorithms but its was a gamble i found it) on youtube while watching Mitsodume and Sakamoto Desu Ga clips. anyone ever heard ""You had me at hello"". The beginning of the anime had me caught (especially after ""Shonen Maid"" but i wont make any spoilers here I, will try)  and got me going. Nothing fancy like all Romantic Comedy genres being chill at the beginning. I will avoid my Guess about Tiaga and Ryuji but if you want to know what I though while watching it hit me up on my myanimelist account. Besides the advertising get to the review:
I believe this is one show that really had my attention from the first few seconds. This show even though just 25 episodes long, reminds me of the great character development of shows like Samurai Champloo and Cow Boy Be Bop (yes, though on different levels and genres) as the characters espically the main ones are gutted for everything they are and you become sympathetic with all of them and you can feel all their collective pains. I can't explain it because I'm not too good with words but if I could sum the story up...Well here:
Tigers and Dragons, katana fights and Unrequited love. All with a big touch eye salt and fresh tears, served with pork cutlets. Yeah this makes no sense but its also youth romance we go crazy around and around and we put sooo much stress in our life and this is one of the best displays of this
Now the Art
Its good no doubt and knows when to do better

No problems for a pirate like me
Characters:
Developed and thought out beginning true to their character no matter what though one shimpachi looking guy is wack in my opinion and good also there is a bald girl shes got some issue too also wack but both are well developed.

MY SORRY ATTEMPT TO PROTECT ACCIDENTAL GLANCERS 
Many people complained about the end in the comments of where I was watching the show saying it was abrupt and it ended without letting the marraige go through and they want to see a season 2. Honestly it was  good end to see those two (if you saw the show you know, you spoiled prick(if your peaking)) come back together and left to our imagination Ryuji doing his duty as a man and keeping his Love true. We don't doubt Ryuji becuase we technically spent a whole school year and more with him. We are given a sufficent end where we see what was destined to happen no matter who got hurt everybody had to moisten their hearts with a tear bleed and stand up and be strong again. Guys treat women with respect and you will get that back, if you want to find a women to love respect her and care for her, throw away your desire to have her assets and never look at a women like that (you know bro) and I swear by God that you will find the women for you.

                Pre-words:
This was one of the few series i watched in my childhood, its one of the few animes ive watched over 10 times, but would gladly watch 10 times more. I dont think ive ever reviewed this anime, but im so happy i re-watched it for the 11'th time or something. I watched this anime back in 2010-11 and it was great.
This series has a bit of violence, but its so ""common"" to see this in highschool so thats not suprise. But tbh, this violence sinks quite down over time in the anime.
Tiger x Dragon, its not really happening that much in the start but
                  once you get it, you will see their friendship grow to something bigger.. I dont think they planned for this but i didnt even remember the ending. Just watch it.
I found this series back again when reading some manga etc, just saw it by accident at the side-panel. I will remember this series and keep watching the other stuff related to toradora.

                To be honest, I never watched anime or even gave it a second prior to last year. I always believed anime and manga were all over the top, boring stories that used the same ideas over an over. But I was sadly mistaken. 
Now Toradora was one of the first anime i'd ever watched,(Other than any of old Toonami stuff like, Dragon Ball Z, Tenchi Muyo or Trigun but what 90's kid Hasn't seen those). So I went into it pretty much blind, not really knowing what to expect. However, by the time I finished the first episode, I was instantly hooked. 
Story: 9
The only
                  reason I didn't give the story a ten was because the ending was slightly unsatisfying (The smallest amount of dissatisfaction possible) but It really doesn't hinder my love for this series. From the beginning, Toradora's story takes you on a roller coaster of emotion. From happiness, to frustration, and even to a point of shedding a couple tears.(Yes, I got emotional at one particular seen, but i'm a man so I have no shame in saying that). 
Art: 9
The Animation was above average for Toradora in my opinion. I've seen other anime with more details and crisper outlines but Toradora definitely Exceeded my exceptions. Everything seemed to blend in well together and flowed through each scene very nicely.
Sound: 9
A huge factor in me liking and disliking an anime is the music and voice over talent. Toradora luckily met and even passed what I expected. Both The intro and ending song were absurdly catchy to the point were I was subconsciously humming the tunes. The voice actors were perfect, with the amazingly talented Rie Kugimiya leading the way.( Taiga's voice actor).
Character: 10
The character's in Toradora were probably the reason I enjoyed this anime so much. Not one single character felt boring or dragged out. Each one had their own personality which grow and developed as the series went on. You hated a certain character for doing something stupid at one point but then loved them a second later, Which leads to the emotion attachment  you have with them. You watched the characters grow throughout, feeling as if you knew them your whole life.
Enjoyment: 10
It's probably one of my top five favorite anime ever. Need I say more.
Overall: 10
As a whole, Toradora exceeded any exception I had going into it. I saw no negative down sides in the anime other then the slight dissatisfaction with the ending but it's not enough to lower my feelings for this anime. If you have thought about watching this anime, don't hesitate. Stop whatever you are doing and go watch it! You will not be disappointed",10

                [Spoiler-free]
SUMMARY
Well realised characters, with consistent development (especially for some supporting characters) and a good pace of storytelling really makes this worth a watch - especially given the refreshing lack of tropes and fan service. Whilst making new, stronger relationships is a key theme here, there is also some thought given to dealing with existing broken ones too - either by reconciling or grieving.
OVERVIEW
Ryuuji Takasu is a high school student that is characterised with a face that makes him look like a thug. His intimidating appearance has meant in the previous school year he was avoided by other schoolmates - leaving him with only the popular
                  school council vice-president, Yuusaku Kitamura, as his close friend. The story picks up at the start of a new year with Takasu determined to make friends and also hopefully win over his crush Minori Kushieda.
Unfortunately he bumps into Taiga ""Palm-Top Tiger"" Aisaka and unexpectedly finds out she has feelings for his friend, Yuusaku. Ryuuji then realising Taiga is friends with Minori - both come to an agreement to help each other try to express themselves to their crushes. Things are further complicated (and occasionally helped) by the arrival of a transfer student and model, Ami Kawashima. Over a number of events, misunderstandings and activities eventually result in several complex love polygons.
REVIEW
Firstly, it's incredibly refreshing to have a male protagonist that is pretty well adjusted to life. Ryuuji has a kind and understanding attitude to his peers (even those undeserving at times), a loving (but sometimes strained) relationship with his workaholic single mother, Yasuko, and rapidly making choices to help someone else regardless of any consequence to himself. Most notably he has had to learn to be able to look after himself, and it's clearly demonstrated that Ryuuji has had to grow up to be an adult far too soon. There is no unnecessary whining or stammering - or what I'd call the ""Shinji Effect"" from Neon Genesis Evangelion. Ryuuji never becomes a bumbling idiot, and his nervousness in talking to his crush is only shortlived.
On the other hand the female protagonist, Taiga Aisaka, is disappointing from the characters - but this is due to the fact, that she spends most of her time throwing tantrums and threats. Her development in the first 6 episodes is minimal, but over time opens up to Ryuuji. Rie Kagiyima does a great job of playing on her ""tsundere"" voice talents - but with a twist, Taiga's persona starts out very harsh and aggressive and then mellows during the course of the series - as opposed to constantly going back and forth over the entire series. When she does revert to her more aggressive personality later on, all of her friends notice and it's a very stark character change supported by the plot developments. It's just a shame there wasn't more time dedicated to her dealing with the difficult relationships in her family.
It does grate at times where Ryuuji is oblivious to other female characters affections towards him, but somehow can figure out that another female character is attracted to someone that's not him. This is permissible though, as the plot never really devolves into a clichéd harem. I should add the dialogue, narrative and strength of characters outshine this point. 
The plot seems to get a shot in the arm at random times by the presence of Ami Kawashima. The model and transfer student, although an interesting character by herself, seems to just act as a Deus Ex Machina plot point at times. She's seemingly just there to provoke someone to say/do something (""Let's race!"" or ""Lets go to my beach house!"" or ""Let's have this party!""), which in turn moves the story forward. Although she's introduced early as this is her mentality of casing trouble and being provocative just for the sake of looking for attention, there are moments where I found myself questioning ""Why are you doing this?"".
By far my favourite character is Minori Kushieda, voiced really well by Yui Horie. Pretty much the very embodiment of an anime manic-pixie-dream-girl. A key highlight was making adorable indirect references to Yu-Gi-Oh at one point as well as talking about alien conspiracies, ghosts, always up for adventure, and always has a sunny disposition while focussing on 1,001 different things in her life. Her character is easily likeable and as her arc develops from the mid-point of the series to the end - I was left feeling she should be the one everyone needs to root for instead of the other characters.
For visuals and audio, everything comes together nicely. There's no sense of anything being done on the cheap - and the recaps at the begining of the next episode are kept short, which is usually a good indicator. There's one notable fight scene, which was pleasantly unexpected, and the animation was surprisingly well done for a slice-of-life drama. Although more focussed on drama, there are some genuinley sweet and funny moments throughout that are worth mentioning. It rarely descends into slapstick and instead, leans more towards sit-com humour.
My only disappointment with this show, was that the last 5 episodes feel far too rushed. At best, the time periods involved at the end undermine the relationships that have grown throughout the series. At worst, life is incredibly unfair to one of the supporting characters. Also the series does end abruptly (but postively) which is a shame. It would've been great to see some more of the characters develop their relationships further.
It's also a shame the series didn't expand further to involve some of the supporting characters. For example the love-life of the homeroom teacher, Yuri Koigakubo, would've been interesting as well as focussing on what happened to a number of other classmates in terms of their relationships. Again this is due to the fact the all the supporting characters are very likeable, even though they have a very short amount of screen time.
CONCLUSION
So if you're looking for a slice-of-life drama, with mild comedy and without tired anime character clichés and tropes - this is a great series to go through. It's a shame there isn't more of this around, or the ending wasn't as expansive but still great nonetheless.",9
"
                This show is my favorite anime of all time, period. 
If any of you recognize my name on other reviews for other shows, you know I love romance anime. This show has one of the most dynamic and unique love stories I've ever witnessed from any show, movie or book EVER. It is built ever so slowly, but in complete perfection in my opinion. Cute and funny at times, sad and longing at others. It had me reading fanfiction like crazy to continue the story where the anime ended. 
It had a fantastic use of music for more emotional scenes, with my favorite OST piece
                  being Lost My Pieces. The first opening will always be my favorite. 
I recommend this story to those who like romance or tsundere girls, cause Taiga Aisaka is the biggest tsundere girl in all animedom!",10
"
                I'll keep it short, since you and I don't have the time to read a fucking doctoral thesis on an anime. This anime is by far the worst show I have ever watched, bar none. 2 minutes into the first episode, I knew what was going to happen, and you probably did too, like I'm talking Hallmark channel predictable. As much as I dislike it, the show was somewhat tolerable and maintained its purpose as mindless entertainment. However, right around the Christmas episode, I genuinely let out the biggest fucking sigh of my life. They had to go around and ruin the series by showing
                  how Taiga is a whiney bitch that goes horny for Ryuuji. I know I said this show was predictable, but it would've been pretty cool to see the two main protags actually help each other and get with their respective crushes. I went into this show thinking it was some feel good slice of life to pass the time. But like I said, around the Christmas episode, it started to take itself way to seriously and ruin all of the character relationships. Ok I'll speedrun here... Ami is underused as fuck, they tossed Minori's emotions around like a fucking potato salad at a neighborhood cookout, the way the characters act in the last 6 episodes is completely out of the blue, the show could've ended at episode 12, and Taiga is more bitchy than your 80 year old neighbor with leukemia asking you to re-mulch her petunias. If you want real mindless slice of life, go watch to love-ru. That's like family guy but with more panty/boob shots and way funnier.",4
"
                It's one of those anime that when i started I knew I was in for a good ride.
It's a bit predictable but not to the point where it's boring. 
Each characters personality made the story for me. The comedy and drama mix very well and with the likeable cast it's a really good mixture.
If you're looking for one of the best romance comedies around then i believe this is a good watch, Be prepared for a lot of laughs and a few cries. 
Taiga Aisaka is probably in my top 5 girl characters i've seen, a tsundere with alot of heart",10
"
                The parts where the protoganists get flustered after thinking about their crush is realistic to how teenagers react when facing a crush.
One of the scenes I relate to are when Taiga and Ryuji are kicking the light pole and yelling out frustrations/judgements they have received like being incompetent. Its Us against the world mentality.
Towards the middle of the season, we start to understand what drives each of the characters and their personalities. 
Taiga- Does not trust people easily and can get into trouble easily. Has a reputation for being crazy and unstable.
Ryuuji - Tries to make people happy and is involved in putting out fires
                  started by Taiga. Enjoys cooking and spending time with his friends. 
Minori - Plays softball and works hard with multiple jobs. Has a positive attitude.
Kitamura - Well liked/popular, VP of student council, and is well-rounded.
Ami - Conceited model, can be seen as fake, and is a constant thorn in Taiga's side. Transfers to the school and tries to gain acceptance of the main group.
Negatives:
Taiga's pessimism and parts where she abuses Ryuuji become old rather quickly. She calls him a mongrel and is ungrateful towards all the kind acts he does for her. 
The scenes with the parrot were cringeworthy. The parrot parts were not funny at all and were mostly it repeating what was just said in the scene.",7
"
                Toradora is definitely one of my favs. the main characters are a scary looking boy who actually loves housework and a tough, short, cute girl. they eventually became good friends. it was a bit predictable about what happens with them, but it was still very good. it had a lot of humor, and some romance along the way. the reason they started to bond was becuz of a similar goal, but the real deal's not till the end.
at first when i saw the picture on the left side, and read the summary i ditched.
but after a few weeks i decided to see it anyways becuz
                  it had a good rating and i didn't know what else to watch.
the art in Toradora had an interesting style, which people does not always notice right away. the model in the story didn't not look, in anyway, special, but it didn't really matter. there is a parrot named Inko-chan who also added a lot of humor to the already awesome anime.
Overall it was very fun and exciting to watch and i would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the comedy-romance genre.",10
"
                TL;DR: they are all delinquent.
Long:
I love psychological stuff and stories with hidden meaning and multiple possible interpretations.
And Toradora! is great as such.
9 because despite of great enjoyment of a hilarious rom-com, it is still too cartoonish and unrealistic. The caracter's decision making process is weird at best. The second-plan characters are one-dimensional. 
The character arcs are amazing but again, too cartoonish, too fast and too embossed.
Nevertheless, it makes you think, it makes you wonder, it makes you guessing, it makes you reading between the lines.
Starting with the cliche characters and situations, tsundere-simp relationship, Toradora! is like a chess game: all figures are simple looking, and the board is only 8x8 but the depth is unlimited.
You wonder why exactly characters do this and that and once you realize that it is not plot armor or deux-ex-machina, you become hooked. You scan the story back and forth trying to find explanation to the events.
SPOILERS ALERT FROM THIS POINT.
You wonder why the heck everybody is so selfish and go head-over-heels to settle their love interest with somebody else?
You wonder at what point exactly Minori was in love with MC and at what point she decided that she needs to step back. Did she joke that she is into girls to push him back or only half-joking. 
You wonder what Ami actually wants. She is not altruistic from the beginning. When she became altruistic? When she fell in love? When it was a first talk where MC open up that he doesn't see her as an adult? Why she is so passive and prefers to sigh that her romance will never be fulfilled? She doesn't want to be an adult but all her attitude is an adult watching cute but stupid children making a mistake after mistake. She says she interferes but you see opposite, she just complains thata everybody else is stupid. Is it how she gets off? If you see that a person declares to be wanting one but always gets another, then this another is the true goal.
You wonder is there is a chance of Minori/Ami spin-off. They go through the same dynamic as some high-rated yuri: fighting to fix each other and working on the common goal.
You wonder when exactly both MC give up on their love plans. Was it worth it? 
You wonder:
did Taiga just, in front of your eyes, first forged master-slave relationship; then father-daughter relationship with improved version of the father figure; then effectively married her ""father""? Wrecking multiple more healthy and potentially successful happy endings in the process?
You wonder if this will work out between them when they do not cooperate on chasing somebody else or not being in the same college?
You wonder: it is all based on dependency. Taiga tries to be independent in the very end. For real? For how long? If she changed, how long ""he saved me and fed me"" will carry them.
You wonder: Ryuji will be a fantastic father and a restaurant owner. But what Taiga would be? Ah, she is rich and spoiled and short-tempered and this is her life plan. OK?
But this wondering is a beauty of this piece.",9
"
                So it was Toradora's turn to be watched, I already knew it since this show is still really popular and somebody is always saying something about it. I must say I was rather disappointed and I expected much more from it. What I would describe this anime as is rather unpredictable but I didn't exactly hate that.
So, it started out rather comedic but then got pretty romantic and serious. Sure this was okay and all but this along with the pretty generic plot and the only real jokes not being that funny just made me get bored. The pace was nothing short of awful during
                  the mid of the series with lots of random things getting tossed around. The plot is rather simple with our MC, Ryuuji and after some events, he starts pretty much being all day with his rich ass but pretty untidy and short-tempered neighbor of Taiga. We also get to know some friends from school, make some more friends, another neighbor, etc. It wasn't horrible but not great either, I found the ending cute and all but it isn't like other series haven't done this quite a lot better and more charmingly, it also felt very out of place, going from her ""liking"" another guy and them (orochimaru's great grandson and taiga) shipping each other to just doing what they did. Rushed and not well executed. Some people that Ryuuji had no reason to like Taiga etc and even though she is a very insufferable girl, she had her good moments, etc, still quite rushed and the pace was traumatizing. They had 25 episodes and they couldn't do that much. 6/10
The art style is colorful and vibrant. I did not like the designs of the 2 characters, oh boy were those the 2 main characters? Yes. The rest looked pretty fine and the quality is amazing for 2008, would give art a 7 since the new most important people did not look good enough. 
The first opening is ""Pre-Parade"", okay this is sufferable but not an opening I liked too much or would like to hear ever again, 6, the second ending is ""silky heart"", okay at least this time the song is good, the animation is unreal for 2008 too. 7.5/10 is not exactly a great song. The first ending is ""Vanilla Salt"", a pretty calm ending, fitting, and the song sounds fine. I would give it an 7, the second ending is ""orange"", ok I remember too many endings named orange. This one might be the worst tho, pretty average but it just sounded alright. 5/10, the last ending is ""Holy Night"", Christmas-themed, well it isn't all that good, 7/10, they quite literally put the most effort into a single ep ending. Sound is a 6 because of the inconsistencies and average songs.
The characters are really memorable because of the art style but other than that they just tried to make the characters pretend to be something and then just show their true selves, not impressive, and when they do their personalities are nothing short of generic. At least the ""shy""/mega annoying-ass tsundere girl gets the D in this anime but tbh Taiga is a character whom I disliked, it isn't because her acting all strong and not being honest with herself and being rude to her lover does not make her cute but it is just annoying. Every single joke or every second is just her being a spoiled brat and Ryuuji just kinda straightening her out. She got rather annoying at times and this whole stress and just being boring made it pretty insufferable, the pace just wasn't good enough. 5/10 since we had a fundamental error regarding one of the characters being a jerk but without having something to refresh you from her actions. It wasn't even a light tsundere act (well she ain't a tsundere but still fits that rude characteristic), she got very angry at times and did quite some shit, she basically was a very bad waifu. The issue is how this anime/novel had no comedic relief when or while this stuff happened, the creator just thought the joke should be how she is angry and this is easily some of the worst comedy for me. For you to laugh or enjoy this is just forgetting about how annoying Taiga was and some more mistakes + going crazy about the romance scenes, I tend to not enjoy the romance parts when the rest of the anime is just cockblocks or one of the two in the relation being a very annoying or bad character, Taiga was that.
I must say I did laugh a couple of times and kind of enjoyed some of the anime but it had several flaws I cannot forgive, 25 episodes and yet nothing to show its worth for as an anime. It is beloved and all that but it just couldn't penetrate my defenses and attach to me. The pace was really poor, especially during the middle, it got tiring and boring but we also have to say it did plenty of things pretty correctly. Some relations are rather realistic and it does some things realistically but that did not make it enjoyable and while they represented some characters realistically, some were just insufferable and unrealistic. I liked how it had some characters act one way and then go all dark but it didn't contribute to this anime's enjoyment or quality. 6/10 because it was not consistent and really tiring at times, I would not just drop it but it got actually extremely boring sometimes. It is your average shoujo with a truckload of arguments and oh shit they are not okay with each other but now they are, not cute but annoying and Taiga is there only to create this vibe during the whole anime. I generally dislike this constant feeling of pressure or common arguments>breaking up or creating an overdramatic situation or perhaps having a third person invade the main relation>oh it's alright because the guy hugged the insufferable girl and now this anime no longer is dogshit. Taiga as a character did this every 3 minutes, she would very commonly act like a complete asshole, just a selfish piece of scum that only has a few friends and those for some reason keep on hanging out with her, then Snekman would hug or tell her something and oWoOWoWOwoOWowOWOoooo she blushed this is very cute, let's do this for 23 episodes and then do something quite immature and illogical. This drama and spoiledness of Taiga's just cancels out any romance for me.
Overall, this anime was pretty disappointing, I was hoping it was a 9 or at least good when it really wasn't. It is a lot older than some shoujo but it also did some things wrong and some well/better.
If we get into detail I would say it was Taiga's fault. At least Ryuuji is a cool guy although he looks like the fetus of a serpent and a human in LOR that was shitted out half a year too fast and somehow evolved to what he is now, he has his talents and likings, some characters got none of these, and very few do but Taiga is the pinnacle of this. Ryuuji does everything except push the shit out of her intestines for her and okay I won't say he had no reason to like her since she had her cute moments or maybe Ryuuji is a masochist? But she is simply too annoying, I find these kinds of personalities cute but it should have limits and also some supporting characters to balance this CONSTANT grumpiness and complete violence/harassment out. I also find their height difference a little awkward or weird, lolis are alright...oh no I meant shit, pls don't bust my house FBI but they really don't match and she is just annoying. The fact they were trying to ship each other and all is a good idea but things just get so rushed near and during the end and I really don't think Ryuuji or anybody with a brain would like to have this insufferable girl as their mate in life. She had her good points and all but she needed something to refresh the viewer, the comedy was not good enough and the other characters only really helped in getting her madder.
If you want an actual shoujo go watch something else, if you just want to push your way through this go ahead but I wouldn't say it is worth it, the story simply is average and generic, the 2 most important characters look bad, the music isn't anything too insane, the characters just don't fit together well enough and while I fail to rank other anime objectively I will say I found this to be a boring experience, I just couldn't take their relationship seriously and the moments did not touch me inappropriately like in other anime. 5/10 but it really had the potential for much more. The pace also is bad and it contributes to how boring this anime gets. Would never expect to have to give it a 5 but it really was just that, some are generic, some are cute and wholesome but this simply was a mess. How did I make my way through it? Well, I just pushed myself on it so hard that I could be reported for rape. 5/10 might seem like insanity but it really was that bad, it simply had many flaws, mostly the characters' personalities, and designs which canceled all fun and romance out. It wanted to capitalize off this tsundere act of Taiga's and ""cute"" moments of her just acting softer + random attributes that were supposed to bring some kind of quality to it like faking personalities and actually being a bad or good person but they all failed to impress me and felt flat.",5
"
                Taiga was the first hardcore experience I had with a tseundere and I haven't found another that I like as much as her. The chemistry of the plot and characters it develops is done right and in the right amount of episodes. It's truly one of (and possibly might be) my favorite show so far because it still makes me feel good while I think about it. It's got all the makings of a good story, starting from the beginning to the end, with core points not being forgotten as the world evolves.
The only real issue I had is the last 1 and a half
                  episodes. A sharp dropoff and then weak reconnection left a bad taste in my (emotions.) I really wish there had been a bit more after the last episode, as to what was next maybe. I wasn't fond of how hard the badass part of Taiga dropped off, but I understand it's necessary for the show to reach its goal, but that's a big part of that curiosity - would she continue to hold ground like that even though Ryuji knows her true feelings? 
It was just that good. This is likely going to be my first rewatch.",10
"
                Where did this show come from, and why is it so GOOD? Those are the questions that have been haunting me for a while now when I think of Toradora. Let me see if I can make sense of it myself.
Toradora, like so many shows, is a romantic comedy, and like so many shows, takes place in high school. But before you turn away in disgust, let me reassure you that it was good enough to make me eat through it in less than 24 hours.
The end of the story is painfully predictable from, well... practically the first episode, but it's not really about the
                  ending in this case - it's about the journey. As you watch time pass and relationships change in this show, you become incredibly attached to the characters, and you really feel affected when they're put through a hurricane of troubling events and don't know exactly what to do. The plot itself is predictable, yet unpredictable, and that may be why it's so good.
Art was fantastic. There are a couple action-packed scenes in the show, despite the fact that it's not really about action, and they look really good. The main characters also look very unique, especially Ryuuji, who appears genuinely strange at first glance, but you soften up to his face quite quickly.
The music was nothing incredible, but it didn't bother me, and I rather liked one of the ending songs. It was catchy, and had cool lyrics.
The characters are what I really want to talk about. Ryuuji is the most unique main character I have seen in a long time. Some people say he's a ""regular guy"" like many main characters, but the fact that his best skills are the very skills that constitute the perfect housewife somehow makes him all the cooler.
Oh wait, sorry - I'm ignoring the tiger in the room. The Palmtop Tiger. The image of a tiny tiger so perfectly describes Taiga, the female lead, that it's almost scary. She herself is also intimidating at first, though she quickly becomes tsundere-like. That stereotype makes me a bit sad, but Taiga just looks and acts so adorable that I look past her obvious stereotype and enjoy her character for what she is.
I don't really know what makes this show better than the average RomCom, but somehow, when you put a thuggish-looking housewife-behaving guy named Ryuuji and a tiny, yet impressively violent girl named Taiga in the same room, you get Toradora, a show that is bafflingly enjoyable. Watch it, and don't question why it's good. It just is.",9
"
                It was kinda slow to start. I didn't really care for Minori for the longest time because she seemed so one note. But Toradora really gets interesting after episode 6 when Ami is introduced. Her real personality really subverted my expectations. So did everyone else's arcs. Minori really gets a huge arc of character development close to the end. Everyone is fakeish to hide their true feelings and that is really interesting and unique to see. I really like the theme exploration of the infatuation and butterflies of a crush vs the deep understanding and support of love.
Ami is a really well written character. It's
                  not everyday that a character is bitchy enough to cause conflict in the story and be an asshole sometimes yet still be a redeemable and likeable character. It's refreshing to see these types of flawed characters because they seem like real people. I didn't like Naoka, another character of this archetype, in Silent Voice because she was too much of an asshole and literally never contributes anything positive to the friendships. Ami tho, does care about her friends and makes up for her mistakes.
My favorite arc is when Ryuji tried to reconcile Taiga and her father because he believed that family should always try to be together without realizing the context of Taiga's situation. He felt that way only because of his own situation where he never met his father. It was really sweet of Taiga to give the reunion a chance for the sake of Ryuji and even sweeter when he realizes that he was in the wrong and apologizes for butting in. My second favorite arc is the ski trip because of the conflict between Ami and Minori and Taiga's attempts to keep the peace.",9
"
                A really heart warming rom-com, one of the best out there. 
Everyone, from the main characters to the supporting cast are just so adorable and well written.
Taiga, the main female protagnist, is a tsundere and 100% waifu material (so is literraly every other girl in this show). Not only that we see her develop over the episodes to become a better person and I just couldn't help but root for her and wish for her to succeed. 
Over the 25 episode run you see the characters develop and their relationships as well, and I 100% grantee you you will want Taiga to end up with
                  Ryuji, despite the fact they each have crushes on each other's best friends.
SPOILERS AHEAD
They do end up as a couple and it is so (I dont know if I could swear here) f***ing adorable.",9
"
                Gave this anime a try because it was so popular, 
I actually just finished watching it in one go. It was a very satisfying anime and I will give it a 9/10 because while the quality was always awesome there was not really a memorable scene for me that you could watch over and over again which you are maybe familiar with if you watch action anime, or some very funny comedy scene and this is what this anime makes an unique experience form me. 
The anime is a whole body, every episode goes smoothly from one to the next and therefore was impossible for
                  me to stop.
What I really liked is that this anime was accurate in many regards, the awkward situation of being rejected by your crush and then seeing her later again in school, the coping mechanism like binge eating when you feel depressed. There was also nothing stupid like a harem. What I liked about the romance aspect is how nervosity and the tension was potrayed, just because you are alone with your crush it does not mean that something necessary will happen.
While I admit there might be some slow episodes and also some clishee anime moments it was still very enjoyable and they also have a reason and make this anime work.",9
"
                Ever watched something where, you know in you very soul, you should rate higher but you can't?
That's Toradora for me and let me explain why. 
1. I dislike pure romance shows. The first two episodes presented the show as a light hearted rom-com, then as if playing a bait and switch the plots and character got way way WAY heavier. By episode 5 this was a pure romance with people switching whom they're interested in so often it made my head spin.
1.5. The writing is REALLY good. No fake outs or false triangles, the character's own actions can effect the outcome which I haven't seen
                  in a very long time and really appreciated. It made it hard to predict the outcome of it all.
2. Episodes 5 - 13 seemed to act as filler. The final main character gets introduced and it takes that long to integrate her into the cast, right up till episode 13 she feels like a one off character that's over staying her welcome. 
2.5. The issues dealt with are heavy ones and it gives a previously superficial character more depth, once integrated into the cast she's actually best girl (to me at least) 
3. Episode 18 - 23... what am I even watching? Is this a different show? The art quality and writing take a sharp hit, they start using very cheap visual tricks to emotionally manipulate the viewer. I hated the Xmas episode so much and it's like they swapped out the characters!
3.5. They keep putting Taiga in white and playing the innocent poor wittle girl card... I didn't like her abuse of Ryuuji when I started the show but now I hate her! worse part of the show and the reason I'm lowering the score.
4. Episodes 24 - 25. What the hell was that? It's an explosion that somehow ended up flatter than a board... 
4.5. There are a few good moments here that managed to hit me hard but... This was such a bitter note to end the series on. Like what? Don't be cheerful and try your best even when things look bad? Explode, throw tantrums and act the role of a child or you'll be alone? 
I'll give it one thing. Toradora is a very memorable series that not only breaks the mold but sets the new standards that even 14 years later other romances still try to copy. You might not like the characters but you get where they're coming from and that takes good writing to achieve. The ending left me feeling cold with quite a few stretches of boredom in the middle for which I have to lower the score.",8
"
                Toradora!, where to start. To me, this show encapsulates what a romantic anime should be. Beyond that, this can be applied to the slice of life anime category as well. While there is a well thought out, beautiful romance that by itself would make the show amazing, the show goes deeper than that, giving us a good life lessons about how we should be as people. 
The second half of this anime represents this well, changing the anime from a fairly light one in the first half to a darker, more dramatic tone in the last half and talking more about life in a serious
                  tone and romance is a lower emphasis (kind of). Each episode is jam packed with scenes that further the story or enhance a character. Toradora! feels like it has no filter in any of its episodes. 
The characters of Toradora! are some of the most well written characters I have seen on any show period.The main five characters of the show, have so much personality and change throughout the series that it honestly is kind of amazing how it is even possible. In particular, Ryuuji, Taiga, and Minori are characters I will love and cherish forever (even Ami in a different/love hate type of way). Every main character has multiple major emotional moments in the series that make you feel every emotion they are currently going through. Even some side characters have these moments as well. Almost every character given screen time feels multi dimensional and human. The characters make the show feel real. 
The only reason why this anime isn't a 10 is because it does kinda drag at some points in the first ten episodes and the art/sound to me wasn't anything amazing. While harsh, I admit it, it kinda comes down to that with rating between a 9 (and even sometimes an 8) to a 10.
Lastly, the show (even with the darker tones) is really the cutest anime I have ever seen. If anyone ever asks me for a recommendation for a romantic or slice of life anime, then Toradora! will be my recommendation.

                As I know Romance genre is one of the hardest one to make because everyone has a different taste and feeling. Once the writer did one mistake, the story will become incomprehensible and unacceptable for some people.
but i this anime (to me), it's very different compare to others romance anime, the two main characters is growing slowly in the story and finally understand the person they love are actually the person they were closest to. It's actually the same thing in real life as well, you might have a friend (opposite gender or not) that you're always with, but you will notice that you are
                  not able to live once he's not here anymore ( not always but the most of time).
I really love this anime because of the story, the setting of the character ( the fact they are the boss of the school lol) and the way their relationship developed. The author is thinking in the position of the reader and it's very enjoyable! After watching this, i went to see the manga (not finished) and the art work is absolutely crazy! I really loved both of them and might be reading the novel as well. 
It's basically one of my favorite anime of all I watched. THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!!!",10
"
                I watched Toradora! for the first time a year ago, in July 2017. My first thoughts on the first episodes were quite critical and I was even willing to drop it as I didn't get the point, but my girlfriend insisted and I kept watching. Soon after, I understood what was so great about Toradora!
Most of my arguments are generally subjective, because I don't feel like exposing the most negative points of the anime knowing that I might have never cried this much with one. Toradora! has made me feel a lot of things, but most of them positive... and it has also taught me
                  a great deal. There's no way I can criticize one of the stories that I know will stay forever in my heart as a part of my life.
If there is something I think Toradora! is really great at is characterizing. Our five principal characters are young students in Japan, sharing hobbies, dreams, thoughts and ideals. They form a group with friendship and enmity between some of them, but in general, they all have a purpose not only for the story, but also for themselves. 
Toradora! is quite exaggerated when it comes to humour or dramatic situations. I think this is actually what makes it so great, because there is a hole lot in between or behind: if you mind too much about how ridiculous some situations may seem, you will miss the whole point. Toradora! talks about hope, about... life. About love and life, yes.
You see how serious it actually is when characters get serious and talk, when they expose their doubts and insecurities, when they recall us that there is a purpose in all of this. They have problems: family, friendship and love; future, happiness that we all seek. Toradora! tries to make us know ourselves or remember who we truly are, or to help us deal with daily matters: schoolish love, lack of a parent, our insecurities towards the future, ...
We get a concrete number of characters and they are all developped: they learn from their mistakes, but also from their naivety, from their confidence, from their lack of trust. They learn from others, from life. We face a situation at the start and, at the end, this situation has completely changed for all of them. How couldn't I feel identified with this when I see myself getting separated from my friends soon, when we will all leave high school to find a new life? This happens in Toradora!, too, because they... grow up. They mature.
No matter how stupid this may sound, this makes me want to cry once more. It's not because of the OST (even though it's impressive), not because of free drama, because this is a human and juvenile adventure that thrills me every and each time I think of it. I just have to watch a concrete moment in this series to start crying, listening or reading to what characters express by laughing, crying, shouting or muting. 
Sometimes, simplism is good enough to deal some of our daily's biggest matters... and Toradora! has touched many with which I feel pretty identified. It might not be the best anime ever, but it certainly is up to now my favorite one. I may confirm that I've never cried this much with an anime. This is... something different. 
I shall leave all this here, in this text, as a confession or the exposition of these thoughts I needed to share after watching the anime for the second time. The first time, I started crying in episode 19; this time, even the first one made me cry. Toradora! is part of me, and whatever happens, I might always consider it my favorite romantic comedy ever.",10
"
                Toradora is about two high schoolers joining forces to help each other out with their crushes while in the process becoming closer with each other. I gave this anime a 10 in every category except for the story. The art was lovely, I love this style of anime. The sound was decent, I watched the subbed version and it flowed quite nice. The characters are hilarious and extremely lovable. I love how in this anime you even grow to love the smaller, quirkier characters, and how everyone comes together in the end. Overall I really enjoyed this anime and it really had the power to
                  make me laugh and cringe happily. The reason why the story wasn't a 10 (I rated it at a 9) is because I don't like how they ended the series. The last episode kind of felt rushed and awkward, they skipped a few details so the jump from episode 24 and 25 felt quite large, as if an episode was missing. I also just in general didn't like the ending, I am a fan of happily ever after, and this anime doesn't quite give you that. Instead it leaves you with a bittersweet, on the verge of disapointed yet also satisfied feeling. I would suggest watching the last episode until the very end, what lies after the credits is where the ""sweet"" comes from in this bittersweet ending. Overall however, I would highly recommend this anime. It is funny, romantic, and is just in general a great short piece to watch.",10
"
                This is a one quality anime here sir. I have to say it's one of my best non cliche romance anime out there. I'd say it's on par with your lie in april with those best friend relationships, with less sadness, but more slice of life values and a good ending. This anime showed me that in life, the people you like are not meant for you, but those people who will always be there for you are the ones you really need. I think you'd appreciate this anime more if you have family issues and raised by a single mother like me, and I
                  cried so damn hard in this anime, damn you anime why do you have to be so real. Friendship values are also strong, I really admire minoru's relationship towards taiga, she'd do anything to make her best friend happy and gets mad when anyone made taiga sad. I really like how their relationship changes, like how they started to have feelings for each other, the timing is just perfect. Anime's like this gives you temporary butterflies and even if it's just a fairy tale, you'd just wish that it would happen to you in real life. I super recommend this anime.",10
"
                When I entered on Netflix and decided to watch Toradora! for the first time, watched the first 3 minutes out of it and instantly dropped it saying ""I can't watch this"" only to be proven wrong that I didn't watch it then.
Toradora! isn't that rare type of anime, is a basic highscholl romcom anime following the stories of a bunch of teenagers who fall in love. But did you ever asked yourself how does love work? Why is it that complicated or what feelings are associated with love? This anime does exactly this, it captivates you by trying to express these things in it's own
                  ways, and make you understand that love will never be an easy subject you'll succed on. But what makes Toradora! great as far as the romance genre goes? The story, which is predictable in a good way where you can always predict what's going to happen next, but that exists because the anime is very enjoyable and it captivates you in a way that it makes you to watch it constantily without dropping it, almost like the anime is telling YOU to continuie it to the last end.
Leaving the principial ideas this anime is based on and going a little deep into the story, Ryuji is the character this anime is constantly moving around, along with it's forever and ever friend Taiga.
Ryuji finds himself to live a boring life alone with it's mother in a small apartament, but things are soon to drastically change once with the beggining of the high school. He meets Taiga, who is knows as ""the fierce tiger"" aka the bully of the high school, by surprisingly ramming into her unintentionally in the first day of high school. She gets nervous as normal, but instead of becoming a vulcano eruption and ready to hit Ryuji with a healthy hit, she fancy choosed to pass this me.
Ultimately, Ryuji and Taiga seem to get along, and both find out they have been neighbours in all this time without anyone knowing anything. They do on the other hand learn that they like in fact each other's best friends, and from this point onwards it could be called the beggining of the story of Ryuji, Taiga, Ami and Yusaku.
Toradora! follows the lighten up story of a group of teenagers, in search for the real vague response of ""What love is"". It has love, it makes you laugh,it has drama, it's a classical story of high school teenagers AND, WARNING it may wake up old high school vibes when you used to fall in love with someone.
I neglected this anime at first and treated it how I shouldn't have it, but I gave it a chance in the end and it opened my eyes upon the fact that I shouldn't judge an anime based on it's animation, studio or etc.
In the end, outstading story, classical 2000's art, ok-ish intro and enddings, over for ever evolving characaters, and an enjoyment of well deserved 9!",9
"
                It was an emotional roller coaster watching this. 
The story flowed very well, providing logical and well-done character development. 
The art style is very unique and there's none that can compare to it. 
There was a good amount of funny comedy, multiple romantic scenes, and everything else needed to portray a good romantic story. 
The twist following the midsection of the whole anime was so enjoyable and wholesome.
This anime is no doubt, going to be my absolute favorite for many years to come, and if I could, I would forget everything else just to remember this one anime to watch for my whole life.
Truly a
                  masterpiece.",10
"
                Toradora! is an absolute masterclass in romantic comedy anime.
The show revolves around Ryuuji Takasu who is a high school student that struggles with his intimidating appearance juxtaposing his kind nature in a way that makes everyone at his school fear him before he even speaks a word to them. Ryuuji has a few friends in his new class that know the true personality behind his scary eyes and they keep him company until others in his classroom warm up to him and find that there's more that meets the eye to him, the main two of those being Minori Kushieda and Yuusaku Kitamura. Ryuuji, soon
                  after beginning his new class year, meets the girl next door to him, Taiga Aisaka. Ryuuji also lives with his mom who is his sole guardian and loves him to death no matter what. The cast of main characters is built upon from there as the show goes on, but that's for you to see for yourself.
As I just mentioned the main players in the show I may as well begin there. The characters in this show are all delightfully funny, unique and relatable. Ryuuji can be stern when he needs to and sensitive in other situations. He's a truly believable high school kid with humorous secrets revolving around his crush, a lack of self-confidence due to his menacing looks he got from his father, and a unwavering desire to do the right thing even if he messes up while trying to carry out this ideal. Minori is an outgoing girl with incalculable drive to better herself both physically and financially, a selfless demeanor no matter the consequences, and a hidden more complex mindset behind the constantly smiling face she wears in public. Kitamura is a genius who is on the student council and is constantly keeping himself busy in a similar fashion to Minori, though he manages to take it a step further than her somehow. He's a perceptive and bright individual who is nearly unshakeable in his motives, is very prone to cooperating with others, plans many events with the student council in the hopes that his class and the rest of the school enjoy them, he's funny and he has a big heart. Taiga is an individual who looks welcoming and friendly due to her long and well-kept curly hair along with her short stature making her seem like a doll come to life, but she, like Ryuuji, is the polar opposite of her appearance as she has managed to intimidate her entire classroom (except for Minori and Kitamura who understand her true personality behind the surface) and has violent tendencies when solving her problems or conflicts with others. She later opens up to her friends, including her new acquaintance Ryuuji, and she shows her softer side that longs for meaningful connections and eventually, love. She's a tsundere for those experienced with anime terms. However, her character is a lot more well-written than most tsundere as she isn't extremely obnoxious for much of the show and has a truly complex mindset behind her rough and tough exterior. More incredibly unique and complex characters arrive throughout the show's progression, but again I leave that for you to experience on your own. I couldn't do these characters, nor their interesting and meaningful character growth, justice in my words. They are all very believable characters too which makes this show that much more special.
The story is very well done and intriguing. The world is decently built out, the plot keeps you on your toes almost constantly with how many surprises and curve balls the show pulls out. I truly didn't know where the relationships between the characters would end up by the end of the series. The romantic triangle, or even square, in this show is fleshed out beyond belief. It all connects and makes meaningful sense without sounding forced or cliché. Feelings of all the characters are constantly evolving and are as such often on the line of getting hurt due to other characters feelings themselves. The story also takes the main cast (and other classmates who are also decently fleshed out and consistent despite not even being main characters which I appreciate greatly) to many different interesting and visually appealing settings. All the way to the last episode the show managed to surprise me with its plot line, it's definitely not a predictable show. I'd also call it very unique in the way it manages to weave its way from start to finish. If you like romantic anime or comedy anime or both this is the show for you even if you've seen dozens of them and the plot points are starting to get too common or predictable for you as this show truly deviates from most of those. As a huge fan of rom-com anime I can confirm that much to you.
The art in this show is very visually appealing honestly. The main characters are all fairly unique in their intricate facial features, Taiga especially. Her face is truly iconic in the anime community, especially since she's one of the most well-known tsundere out there but also because her design is appealing and cute. The settings of the show are also well-drawn, nothing ground-breaking but appealing nonetheless. I really enjoyed how the food was drawn, and that's important since Ryuuji is cooking fairly often in the show for his mother who is often too busy sleeping or at work to do it herself.
The soundtrack and sound design was quite well done as well. The audio producer definitely knew how to fit tracks to scene tone's. I enjoyed every single song in the show, no lie. None of them ever felt in the way of the mood, like they had been overused and now felt grating, or that they simply weren't well produced songs. They amplified the feelings of the scene they were played behind well.
I thoroughly enjoyed this series from start to finish, so much so that I often found myself going to the next episode to continue the plot of this show regardless of time constraints I may have had. I also found myself going ""Wow, the episode is over already? That didn't feel like 20 minutes at all."" It made me laugh often, smile even more so, and even cry at things I didn't expect to cry at. The narrative in this show is truly compelling and one-of-a-kind in my view. I cannot recommend you watch this more, especially if you're into romance anime or romance/comedy anime, but even if you don't usually venture into those genres this show is still well written outside of those interactions and you may find yourself enjoying the show regardless.
This last part is just for little things throughout the show that I noticed and felt they were interesting enough to comment upon. The symbolism of the two birds throughout the show was a really nice touch, which I believe are supposed to symbolize the two main romantic partners in the show (which you will know if you watch this amazing anime). I also enjoyed the symbolism of the star throughout the show that clearly denotes the small but bright character that often feels alone. I enjoyed the use of the word ""shining"" to describe Ryuuji in the show as well as it connected directly to the star symbolism as stars are known for their bright shine. I also enjoyed the way that Ryuuji and Taiga are deliberately written to be exact opposites in their main character traits, with Taiga being small and cute but actually being quite intimidating to those around her (save for a few individuals with special places in her heart, but even then she is still quite headstrong) and Ryuuji being tall and rougher-looking while actually being a sweet guy with a small ego and one who enjoys housework, especially cleaning. It's a fun juxtaposition and makes the way the story plays out in the end even more unique. Lastly, shout out to Minori and Kitamura for being selfless as hell throughout the show, its admirable. They're definitely MVPs of this show, along with another individual who comes along later. Watch the show to find out who I mean! Enjoy!",10
"
                This won't be much of a long review, I wont go into the different aspects of the anime,  I just want to say one thing.
I have watched a lot of different anime's and I mean a lot. I always love these romances for the fact that it feels like a roller coaster of emotions you go on with the characters, and in my watching I have found about three types (very generally speaking) 1. The type that always leaves you wanting more, it feels like you can never get enough. These are great, but no one likes be hungry.
2. the type that makes you
                  sad that is over it feels like its incomplete. 
and the 3rd which is a bit more rare. The type where you aren't sad, and you don't feel desperate for more because you bonded with the characters so much you can just see their life just going on further down their road.
This was the 3rd type. A story and character so good that you aren't sure if you will see them again, but your time with them was so nice that you will never forget.",10
"
                This will be my first anime review for this website and having just finished Toradora!, I just had to review it. I'm going to try to keep this review as spoiler free as I can so rest assured this is just an overall review of the show. I'd like to start off by giving some info about myself. I've been watching anime consistently for about the last 4-5 years or so and watch animes of all genres. When it comes to romcom animes, I do very much enjoy them. At the moment it seems like I can't stop myself from watching them hehe. But anyways,
                  ON TO THE REVIEW: 
Story (10/10): 
The story of Toradora is honestly one that will keep you watching in hopes of finding out how it all ends. And then whenever it does end, you'll want more!!! I cannot explain the hole in my heart I feel now knowing I've finished this anime. It really is just a sweet, charming, hilarious story of two high school students becoming lifelong soulmates. This is the kind of anime that you watch and by the time you know it, you finish and episode and you're like, ""what the f*** that felt like a 5 min episode. The story is truly engrossing and entertaining through and through. I've watched my fair share of slice of life animes and although I can see some similar tropes that this show has, it still nonetheless is really a refreshing tale. A reason why I think the story is just outstanding and the build up towards the last couple of episodes pays off is because of how easily you're able to relate to aspects of the story and even characters. It makes moments of confrontation or of despair hit so much harder. There's a lot to learn from the story and I know I'll always keep the lessons I learn close to heart. 
Art (8/10): 
I'm not going to lie, the art of Toradora! is fine. Like I don't think it's terrible by any means but I also don't think it's entirely outstanding either. One thing I did say to myself as I was first watching it was ""wow for an anime that came out in 2008, this animation is actually pretty good."" I think a reason I thought this is because animes that I'm currently watching from 2008 still have a 4:3 aspect ratio which I hateeeeee. And when I see animes with 4:3 ratio, I just automatically think of it as an older anime. But Toradora is thankfully not in this ratio and the animation is pretty good for it's time. I don't think the art is the selling point of this anime though. Or rather I don't think the art should be the selling point. There's so many other aspects of the show that are just incredible that I think the art is just a plus to the show. 
Sound (10/10):
Oh boy, oh boy. Let me talk about the sound. It's great. Just MWAH MWAH chefs kiss* good. If I could give it a 11/10 I would. The soundtrack to Toradora is truly an amazing experience. It really enhances scenes that are supposed to make the audience feel something and it leaves an impression as well. I would highly give the soundtrack of Toradora a listen if you haven't already. The opening and endings songs also slapppppp. They slap harder than my mom did when I was a kid. Like I'm honestly going to go listen to the OPs after I finish this review lol. It's just good stuff. It's earcrack that's what it is! This may be an unfair take, but if an anime has a really good and catchy OP, I will 100% love it more. And that's the case for Toradora too hehe. But yeah the sound to this show is truly amazing. It enhances scenes between Ryuji and Taiga by tenfold and makes the show just so much more enjoyable and memorable. 
Character (10/10): 
Ok so you know how I said I'd give the sound of Toradora an 11/10 if I could?? Well I would give the character category a 1000000000/10 if I could. I loved these characters. And you will 100% love them too. The characters of this show are what I'd consider the selling point of the show. They're just so distinct and likeable, even when Taiga is being a complete utter butt lol. Idk this anime just reminded me times of when I was in high school and my circle of friends I had. You become so close to people in high school because of how often you see them everyday and that's what similarly happens in this show. Every character in this show feels like they serve a purpose. Even the characters that you just see in the background at first end up having their fair share of screen time that I thoroughly enjoyed. The writers of this show did a really good job of getting the audience to understand what character traits each character has. They have their niches and their way of being and you learn what makes them the way that they are throughout the show. The character development is just really good in this show. And I love how this show takes into consideration every character out there, not just the main five characters you see in the intro. Man I just really loved these characters. Which is why it hits even harder when the show endsssssss. BECAUSE I WISH I COULD SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM LATER ON. I wish I could see them grow up more into adults and see who they end up becoming in life. Also, Midori... Midori is best girl!! I loved Midori's character. And I'm sure you'll love her toooooo. 
Enjoyment (10/10):
It's just a good time watching this anime. I wish I could see this with someone who hasn't seen it. Or even I wish I could experience watching this anime again. This anime is just really great. I feel dumb just saying this anime is great over and over lol BUT IT'S TRUE. I just got so into the story and the characters that by the time I knew it, I was done with the show. What a good anime. Definitely up there in my favorite animes of all time. Watching this also reminded me why I love slice of life animes so much. They just make you feel so warm and happy inside and make you forget about the real world. They can take you out of a bad mood and just make your day so much better. Until you watch the ending and you hate life even more lol. But really this anime is super sweet and super endearing. I loved the relationships that formed with the characters and I loved how much they just cared for one another. There's a real sense of community when it comes to this show and it makes me wish I had even a sliver of it. It's really weird to think about too, but I find the more time that goes on from when I watched the last episode, the more I find myself thinking about this show. 
Overall (9/10):
The only reason why I give this anime a 9/10 is because of the animation. Like I said I don't think the animation is terrible but I also don't think it's something to rave about so for that reason, I took a point off from overall rating. But regardless, THIS SHOW IS STILL REALLY GOOD. Like if we're not even talking about the animation, then this show is 10/10 across all boards. It's just a really solid romcom anime. I enjoyed every part of it. And I will now obsess over this show for weeks to come lol. I can see why this anime is considered a classic and I only wish I had watched it sooner. If you made it to the end of my review, thanks for reading!! And I hope you enjoy Toradora!!!",9

Art & Sound- 7

Overall- 7
Toradora! is actually pretty unique. The genres that stick out are really comedy and romance. 
The story is about guy who meets a girl who becomes friends and they're relationship starts to bloom. Because there wasn't really much to it I gave it a 7.
The art was alright, nothing really wrong with it but I felt that it could have been better. I kinda feel that the art needs a little more color into it, to me the art just seems a little dull, but at the same time its something that you can work with and still
                  enjoy the anime. The sound on the other hand was alright, nothing that really interested me, I can't even remember any of the music at the moment, and to even point it out the show didn't even have an opening theme lol (or maybe its because of the place I watched it from).
The reason I gave a 9 for characters is because of the main character. He lives with his mom who happens to be single and who works at night and because of this he is responsible. Its quite silly that he's the one who always does the cooking and the cleaning. He is also a likable guy who is respectful.
Overall I kinda liked the anime at first but eventually it died to me. To me it felt a little too silly and it eventually failed to keep me into it. I do know its a good anime because many people have said good things about it and many people favor it (which is why I first started watching it). Toradora! isn't for everyone, unless your looking for something not serious and for romance and humor.",7
"
                This show just hurt me, and not in a good way either. I'm still upset about it that I'm writing a review a week later
*This review contains spoilers*
I started watching this show because I had heard good things about it and it had just got added to Netflix. What hurts is that I really wanted to love this show, it's a genre that I love and want to watch more of. The rating is a 7 because there's a lot of aspects I really did like about ""Toradora!"". But through a struggle of focusing on the plot and the show forcing a romance and becoming
                  extremely predictable in the last few episodes the show just killed itself for me.
Story 6/10:
Imagine the show like a man walking on a road, where the road is the plot. For episodes 1 - 15 the man is sort of doing a snake while walking the road, walking off every few episodes and then getting back on track. The episodes are mainly used for character development but the narrative of the main characters (Ryu and Taiga) suffers and seems to be forgotten in a few episodes because of this. Which is weird because that narrative is the entire reason for these characters to even talking to each other in the first place.
Now episodes 15 - 21, the show is like, ""Oh shit, we have characters now? Maybe we should run with them now."" The story starts to develop in the Christmas episodes, which are really fantastic episodes. Ryuji decides to finally make an effort with Minori, but Minori rejects him for the sake of Taiga. Now the scene with Taiga some people say that scene is Taiga realizing her ""feelings"" for Ryuji. The way she words it, to me she's realizing how much she depends on Ryuji for her lively hood (which develops into feelings later but we'll get into that). Taiga gets upset and goes outside to run after him but he's already gone. She cries and, I don't understand this still, for whatever FUCKING reason, Minori is there and overhears her. Why was she there? I still don't know. I forgive it though because even though they could have placed that better, Minori's decision to reject Ryuji there drives the story for the next few episodes. Taiga after realizing after how much she depends on Ryuji decides to actually get her life together so that Minori doesn't think that she will be taking Ryuji away from her, which is so fantastic for her character and starts to allow her to stand on her own. With the slight screw up by Taiga now resolved, another opportunity arises for Minori and Ryuji to tell each other how they feel on a school retreat. 
The show is building and building, all of the boys escape NEAR DEATH while listening to Ami and Minori argue back and forth. We're getting closer and closer, but oh.....Taiga fell down the mountain and no one can find her. Well it's fine I guess the writers have to focus on her a little bit still, Ryuji finds her its all goo- wait, what is she saying? ""I just can't stop myself..."" WAIT, NO DON'T DO IT, DON'T BECOME PREDICTABLE AND FORCE A ROMANCE, PLEASE! ""...from loving Ryuji...""
At this point, the man walking on the road has taken a gun to his head, killed himself, and is being dragged to the end of the road by the strings of the writers. Why does every romance have to do this? Build up a false narrative just to change their minds in the last few episodes to try and get a shocked reaction from the viewers. If the relationship between Taiga and Ryuji had been built differently and not on the needs of Taiga but on mutual respect and common interests it might have made more sense. More sense in the case of Ryuji, who in the next episode just decides, ""Yeah I totally like Taiga now, it's not like I was trying for the past 21 episodes to get with Minori :)"" It's just so forced, it can be looked over slightly for Taiga because she thinks someone loving you is taking care of every aspect of your lively hood and basically being your maid because she had been living with alone; with no one taking care of her for years. But Ryuji didn't feel this way about Taiga until it was forced upon by the writers in the last episodes, he only enjoyed being friends with her because he liked taking care of her and the help with Minori. Ami was literally right when she said he needed to stop being her Daddy (holy shit that sounds so weird out of context).
A contradiction that people could confront me with is ""Oh, it's obvious that they'll end up together by looking at the synopsis and the poster art for the show."" And while I agree with that to an extent, the way they built the relationship between these two characters throughout the show, at no point was ever heading in that direction until it was decided in the last few episodes. The show builds its narrative in a way that never alludes to that level of romance occurring. If they had done it naturally and built up their romantic relationship throughout and gradually then it would have been fine but at no point in the show do they ever fucking do that.
I would like to quote from a very good TV show called Steven Universe Future, ""Your soulmate is your complement, not your missing piece."" Taiga wasn't a complete character, she depends on Ryuji for every problem throughout the show. Then when she finally starts to work on herself and become independent the writers go, ""Oh no, we have to make sure these characters are together!""
The last episodes are just annoying, all of their friends decide to make personal sacrifices so that Taiga and Ryuji's teen marriage can work out, but then the writers decide to back out of that (thank god). The only part I liked about the last few episodes was the development for Ryuji's mother, which I feel like could have been put in earlier in the show under different circumstances. The last episode Taiga finally decides to face some of her problems herself and goes to live with her mother, which I guess helps her a little bit but she's still depending on others.
Art 8/10:
There's nothing too special here, it's a typical anime. I love the character design for Ryuji though, it's honestly genius and it leads to some of the best comedic moments of the show.
Music 7/10:
I don't specifically recall any really memorable tracks but all the music fits for the right moments
Characters 9/10: This is where the show really shines for me and probably the only reason it's an overall 7/10. For this we're gonna pretend episodes 22 - 25 don't exist. I love Ryuji so much, his entire personality completely makes the show. Taiga almost seems bipolar at times but her short temper is just hilarious throughout the show. Minori is kinda of a dumb bitch who hides that she's actually smart and picks up on all social ques and I respect that because I try to be like that (me picking up all the social ques to fuck off because I'm weird). Nothing too special about Kitamura, he's honestly just a bro that has his moments. Ami is surprisingly a really enjoyable character who hides that she's a bastard to everyone (She's like Minori but more of a bitch I guess). That bastard is the best part of Ami because she knows what's up and gives good advice to Ryui (She's probably only giving that advice to get in his pants but we're not gonna talk about that).
Enjoyment 7/10: Everything before the end of episode 21 I honestly really enjoyed. I had my own little gripes with some episodes and decisions the characters made but honestly the show was fun.
""Toradora!"" tries its best to be unpredictable and well driven, and it succeeds at a lot of areas until ultimately wiping itself out for me in the last few episodes. Would I watch this again? Maybe for an more in depth review on every episode but for enjoyment or fun I would say no. 
If you guys thought differently about the show, I don't give a shit, everything I said made sense to me. Sorry if this ruined Toradora! for you.",7

Story-8
A classic romantic/comedy taking place in a high school, a very overused scenario in anime. Although I was pleasantly surprised to see how the story unfolded. Im usually a sucker for rom coms so this series already was on my good side. As I was introduced to our characters I began to notice how intriguing their relationships actually were. Taiga and Ryuuji are complete opposites yet they attract each
                  other so strongly. This show became very addicting very fast.
Art-7
Good animation, great character design, and solid looks overall. No scenes were ruined to me due to animation :)
Sound-8
Soundtrack fits the anime very well, The opening and ending are great and unique listens!
Character-10
Taiga and Ryuuji are the best rom com duo ive seen so far. The way ryuuji always takes care of taiga despite her attitude is inspiring. Taigas personality/backstory makes her character work perfectly. I cant stress how well these two mash together for the series. Not to mention the supporting cast, they never fail to keep me entertained. I never got tired of any characters in fact I wouldn't mind more episodes. Love this series.",8
"
                Toradora: an exceptional anime with nothing exceptional about it 
...and also the anime that has surprised me the most (in a good way). 
Before starting, I want to make some things clear about my analysis. Being a slice of life/romance anime, the core of the show is not a high level animation or even (obviously) exciting fights like the ones we see in shounens. No. What we should look for in a show like this one is the plot, the characters and their relations, and how the characters and the plot converse with each other. That being clear, let's talk specifically about Toradora
In a first
                  look, there's nothing exceptional about it. In a second look too. Toradora doesn't really have anything super special. So, since there's nothing special about it, why is it so good? the thing about Toradora is that it develops its elements (even though they are absolutely basic) SO WELL, so fluidly... 
Characters... oh, the characters... personally, I think this is the strongest point in the anime. They are not just well written, they are also really well developed along the plot and their relations with each other are just BRILLIANT. There's always a reason why characters do what they do, relate like they do, and are like they are. Ryuji, the main character, for example, is a boy whose father abandoned him and his mother. Therefore, Ryuji was written as a guy who wants to do all the domestic work and stuff like that, as if trying to make up for his mother (consequently expanding this behavior to all his relations too) because of his father absence. Here we can see how Ryuji's personality perfectly fit within his life story
The plot, as I said, is nothing too pompous. It is basically centered in the development of his relation with Taiga, which has a perfect rhythm, and personally, I think they are a really great couple, not being an exact opposite (able to flee from most cliches in animes like this). Despite it's focused in Ryuji-Taiga's relation, the story gives enough attention and space to all side characters, allowing the spectators to empathize with them, and they are included in the center of the problematization of the plot. Nothing's treated randomly 
Besides, the soundtrack and art are ok. I think they fit in what the studio wanted for Toradora, transmitting satisfactorily the emotions of each scene
lastly, I had a very good time watching Toradora. As I said, I had absolutely no expectations when I started, because the anime doesn't call any attention. But as I kept watching and seeing how things converged to an end, the anime really got me and now is one of my favorites. Feel free to watch, hope you enjoy!",9
"
                Sometimes an anime slips through your radar after it comes out, and for years afterwards you catch references to it, hear it mentioned as someone's favorite, and something someone says will finally make you say, ""Okay, I guess I'l finally watch this."" It doesn't come out of anything negative, but there are just so many anime to watch and you can't watch everything. That's why I'm only now watched ""Toradora!"", an anime that made a huge splash in the American Anime community that is now over a decade old.
From the first several episodes, this anime caught my interest with its use of comedy. Japanese humor
                  can often waffle in translation, but the timing, writing, and facial expressions here were great, hitting my funny bone far more often than it missed. The characters quickly endeared themselves to me as well, their quirkiness coming off more charming than forced as it can be seen elsewhere. Ryuuji's cleaning obsession, Kitamura's ridiculous thought process, Minori's seemingly random outbursts, they all blended together to make amazing interactions. But they all have more depth to them as well, insecurities that drive the plot.
However, it's the plot where I had quite a few issues. As invested and excited as I was early on, the middle-to-end of the series hit me hard with tedium. Unlike a lot of other slice-of-life series, which are usually paced with one-off episodes and/or larger arcs, ""Toradora!"" instead is mostly two or three episode story arcs that center all the characters on one event or issue. I'm aware this is most likely due to each arc being an adaptation of a light novel, but it seriously hurt the pacing for me. Short arcs like these didn't give the main cast time to breathe, time to just relax and play off each other. For most of the series, because there's some larger issue in the works, that either drives or underlies every scene with them, which didn't give me the space I felt the characters needed to really shine. It also hurt the larger plot elements that lasted beyond the plot arcs, as each felt like it was trying to resolve the pressing issues but can't because the series wasn't ready to get there yet. It was supposed to feel like each resolved arc developed the characters a little bit in certain directions, but I rarely felt that progress in-scene, and more often than not the show felt like it was dragging its feet.
Without spoiling anything, I knew where this series was going to end up early on, because it was playing with the right bag of tropes that inevitably lead to that conclusion. That's not a bad thing, but what was irritating was how slowly it got there. This is a twenty-five episode series, and I was begging for it to just reach the end of the main arc already halfway through. This is a serious issue a lot of anime have in regards to romance: it's all about the chase, but the actual romantic relationship is very rarely seen, which is what makes series like ""My Love Story"" all the more special. If this was really just going to be about the prologue and not go into the actual meat, which is what it ended up doing, I would have much rather it be 13 or 14 episodes, to tighten that arc up and cut the fat. Do not tell me that can't be done, because there are anime that do that and more in less than that time, see ""Puella Magi Madoka Magica"" for reference. With the length this anime did end up using I would have been a lot happier if it had actually gone more into the main romance as a couple, because instead it's more teasing of what it will be like, hints at what some of us really wanted.
I don't want to be all doom and gloom about this anime, I really don't. For all the negative things I have to say about it, for all its untapped potential, the ending still pulled me around a lot, giving me a lot of fantastic scenes that really made me feel the feels and laugh the laughs. What little we did get to see of the main couple as a couple was absolutely wonderful, and if you couldn't tell it really left me wanting for more. I was actually considering giving it a 7/10, but the finale left me with enough warm fuzzies to bump that up a number, though if we were using decimal points I'd probably score it more as a 7.8/10 or so. If you enjoy Slice of Life anime, especially funny ones that get serious on occasion, than if you haven't seen this already you absolutely should. I don't really consider it a masterpiece or a classic, but Very Good is definitely an adjective I would use.",8
"
                Another easy watching, rom-com anime. My favourite type of anime!
It was just such a great series to chuck onto to just binge on a cruisy, cosy winter afternoon. No intense action, drama or storylines. Just a whole lot of light - heartedness.
I must say, Ryuji is the kindest guy for putting up with all the crap that Taiga put him through. She was constantly being so mean to him. But he took it like a pro, and continued to be the bigger guy. 
And it was so nice to see Taiga redeem herself throughout the series. To loose some of her mean character and to
                  become more kinder and softer, growing as a person. I wasn't the biggest fan of the whole ""cute - angry, tiny girl character"". Trust me, I'm very tiny. But I'm definitely not mean or angry. And I'm not particularly cute either.
Also, did anyone else want to slap Ami the majority of the time she was on the show. Her bitchiness, fake barbie storyline really irked me. But I was really glad to see her growth and redemption at the end of the season too.
Also, surely it wasn't just me who knew from like, episode 2 that it was going to be Ryuji and Taiga being endgame, right?! But when they finally kissed in ep 24, well that was the sweetest, most satisfying kiss that I've ever seen in anime.",8
"
                The show was really good but it left me wanting more due to it being really short and the ending was quite unsatisfactory. However the show did very well with the low amount of episodes, the story was great and the characters had a lot of development. The characters progressing as friends was a huge focus on the show and was definitely my favourite part of the show entirely. The Christmas episodes are some of my favourite and the atmosphere they give are very nice and the scenery is beautiful. I thoroughly enjoyed the series and think everybody should watch it at least once in
                  their life.",9
"
                I am certain that I wouldn't be alone in calling Toradora one of the all time greats.
“Since ancient times, the dragon has been the only beast to equal the tiger. Even if you’re not by my side right now, I will leap through space and time and always be by your side. These feelings will never change.”
Picking the words to describe this anime is incredibly difficult. I worry that no matter how I choose to describe it, I will still end up selling it short.
On the face of it, there isn't much to Toradora, Ryuji and Taiga each have a crush on the others friends,
                  and aim to help each other acheive their goals, and that's exactly where Toradora's simplistic beauty shines through, it truly is a romance at heart, and won't try to hide that from you in any way. Never has a romance taken me on the journey that Toradora did.
Perhaps as it's one of my first ever anime's it holds a special place in my heart, however truly I cannot express my love for this show enough.
If you're game for a romance, filled with friendship, antics and Ryujis cooking, then settle in, bring a box of tissues and prepare to fall in love with Toradora.",10
"
                Graphic design: 7/10, it was really nice and slim untill the end, nothing really
impressive, but good.
Audio and music: 9/10, both intro and outro were at the highest level, despite the fact that the first intro was worse done graphically it was better for me by the wonderful music and song, in the anime the sounds were great too, the acting was masterly, especially from the main characters.
I would like to emphasize once again how much I liked the intro and the outro because they were really well done, and every episode I always watched them.
Characters: 9/10, all are unique and interesting in their own way,
                  not only the main but also side ones (except for this pinkhair one, I could not understand her to the end).
Story: 7/10, it is hard to come up with something original for a romantic story, here you can say that the plot was just different because of the unusual personalities of the main characters and the problems they struggled with. I also liked it very much that every hero had some deeper reason for his actions, why they behaved like this, and not otherwise (except for pinkhair because she did not know what she wants).
Enjoyment: 8/10, I really liked this anime but it had some stupid moments when I just could not watch it. 
Overall: 8",8
"
                All the characters are thankfully enjoyable enough; I get the impression the archetypes have aged a bit since 2008 or whenever. Taiga is at her peak early on when basically unable to communicate with others due to her high levels of derangement. 
The direction of things is made basically as obvious as possible (its in the name of the show), so all other love triangle participants are on borrowed time from the get go. Plot developments are like icebergs bobbing on the horizon, easily made out from miles away. 
I felt good about that trajectory but the later (pretty rushed and underdone) development of the
                  relationships felt a bit strange. Its hard not to just feel bad for Minori and confused about Ami's whole deal in the story (least developed character; hot girl who hangs around with the protagonist for vague reasons). 
But I left feeling happy and liking everyone which is frankly what I came here for so Toradora does the job.",7
"
                CONTAINS SPOILERS
This anime made me mad in ways that I thought could not be outdone by Aoi Hana. Honestly, the world building is pretty good and some of the characters are pretty likable. However, the main characters, Taiga and Ryuji, are not. I think the fact that they end up together at the end is actually stupid. 
Here are some problems with the anime:
-Unexplained love from Kawashima towards Ryjui. I admired Kawashima's character until I realized she herself lacked the guts to confess to Ryuji.
-Queer baiting from the writers when they made Minori say she ""preferred girls"" then randomly reversed that so it could fit
                  the plot later. 
-Taiga is insanely unlikable until late in the show.
-The anime is too long for what it is.
-Ridiculous drama and ending.
-Ryuji is infuriatingly stupid and simps a ridiculous amount.
Strengths?
-Good side characters that were bothered to be filled out.
-Enjoyable scenes
-There are times in the show that get you very excited.
-Meaningful dialogue and speculation on life.
Honestly even though I rated this show a 6, I would not recommend it to a friend. This show kind of sucks in a structural way. Watch at your own risk.",7
"
                Toradora is one of those very rare romantic comedies that you find in anime and in normal television as well that you can sit there and laugh at when it's supposed to be funny, and feel for the characters when it's supposed to be serious. thats teh kind of quality's i look for in anime of this kind. and Toradora really did that for me. I mean come on, since when do tsundere's get cuter then Taiga 'The Palmtop Tiger' Aisaka? No seriously, message me if there is any tsundere that is cuter then her. no? no one? exactly my point. And one thing, even
                  though i hate fanservice, and it's one of the main things that brings an anime down for me, but i can overlook that when it comes to Toradora. and even i found my self laughing at the moments fanservice was present, because they did such a good job making the scene hillarious AF. Thank the anime gods for the greatest romance show of all time!",10
"
                I'm just going to say.  Watch it.  Right now.  Stop reading this review and watch it.  Like right now,  Seriously I dont understand why your still reading, and not watching!!!!    But if you seriously want to read my review, and watch it later, then by all means go right ahead.
My Review:
Toradora was an amazing watch.  the first episode really set the stage for the rest of the anime.  It was both comical and very entertaining.  Everything about Toradora's first episode was what made me want to watch more.  Story Development was Great, but
                  could have had more room for improvement.  The art was very good,  and really suited the anime.  Sound was good,(you know sound for an anime is really hard to review...  Idk why they put it there.)
Character development was great.  It really showed who was liking who and at what points in the anime.  The Main Character was the only one with strange eyes, that really made him look like he wanted to murder your face.  But thats what made it funny.  The one character that I really hated(But really enjoyed Hating) was their little bird thing, Inko-chan.  It really looked ""special"" and like it needed help.  And I was waiting for it to just Keel Over and Die. (Which is doesnt do.  sadly)
My Enjoyment rating is 10 because it was really REALLY REALLY(I want the words to get bigger) REAAALLY Funny!!!  Everyone was kicking someone, and there was a really cool fight scene in the middle.  
Overall its a 9 because It made me laugh, and it had a really good story.  The Last episode was what really pieced it together.  I thought it was going to have a Key/Visual Art(Clannad/Angel Beats) type of ending, but it didn't.  You'll have to watch it to really enjoy it.  Watch for after the credits on the last episode to really kno what i'm talking about.
Now what the H*** are you doing reading this.  Turn on your Anime Viewer or whatever you use to watch anime...
AND GO WATCH TORADORA!!!!",9
"
                Honestly this anime is for kids, there’s a lot of problems I’ve seen I don’t think anyone older than a middle school level would be able to get through. It was one of the first romance anime’s I watched, when I was like in 6th grade and I loved it. Now rewatching it I see how toxic the relationship is with everyone. Of course, it’s suppose to be a comedy- The female lead attacking and harassing the male lead is something that’s seen often and if used right it can be a good story but honestly it just got annoying at some point plus the
                  ending was a little upsetting but maybe it’s because I’m older that tsundere stories that deal with mainly attacking the love interest whether it mentally or physically isn’t something I look for something in a romance anime anymore. I love teasing, but sometimes stories take it to far- mostly when the tsundere character is a woman because at this points it’s just straight up abuse PMFAO. And it’s look past because she’s tiny and a girl.",7
"
                I usually don't watch rom-coms, but this one actually got me hooked and was really good at the start etc. The only problem i have with this anime is the ending.
Spoilers (but not really if your familiar with rom-coms..)
It was obvious from the cover art, but it was still painful to see Taiga and Ryuuji get together instead of their original crushes. If their original crushes got together, my score would've gone from a 4 to an 8 in a heartbeat.
I get why they got together at the end, but i just think that it would've been a lot more interesting if they didn't follow
                  the typical boring *main characters become friends and the girl always ''bully'' the guy, which leads to them getting feelings for each other over time, then there is denial, then drama (normally an argument over something stupid or a misunderstanding with another girl), to then them squaring up with each other and gets together* which is the most boring thing ever since most rom-coms use this. 
Its kinda like how harem animes always creates the most boring main character as a girl magnet, and that the main character is dumb as a goldfish, or how many action animes has this overpowered main character that ends up being the strongest being alive /  or is incredibly special.",4
"
                Ahhh Toradora! has a special place in my romance anime loving heart! It is honestly what got me hooked on the shoujo and slice of life animes. Thanks to this show I have been exposed to other great ones (Maid Sama, Fruits Basket, Say I love You, etc.). Anyways back to this little gem, at a time when the pandemic and social/political upheavals in the US were at an all time high in 2020, I found myself quarantined watching this anime which brought me so much joy. It was truly a guilty pleasure but not really because it was just so wholesome there's nothing to
                  feel guilty about! It did a fantastic job of character development. It gave you a good understanding of all of their teen struggles while making you laugh. I love that the Taiga is loud and outgoing vs your shy introvert main girls. Even the episode with stuffing her bathing suit, it was so silly but relatable and the way it was handled by all the characters was so cute! There is laughter, jealousy, sad moments happy moments all in all it is a classic in my book of this wholesome genre. Highly recommend!",10
"
                I wasn’t expecting much from Toradora, except that it would your standard high school romance, well it kind of was. Toradora doesn’t do anything new, it just executes the idea of high school romance very well. The plot is very well-paced, and it takes time to develop the relationship between the characters. The romance aspect doesn’t feel rushed, although you can tell early on who’s going to end up together. Toradora's greatest strength comes from its character. None of the characters are one dimensional. Taiga, for example, is usually shown as arrogant and aggressive, but we see her have her insecurities. Ryuuji is a character
                  that had to grow up faster than most people. We see him do everything in the house, from cleaning, cooking, and going to the market to buy food for the day. We learn that his mom works at night and sleeps during the day. Overall, the characters are 3-dimensional and their interactions with each other are great. Overall, I enjoyed Toradora, and recommend it to anyone who wants a good story with amazing characters.",10
"
                This show is amazing for so many reasons. The music/openings are really catchy and really nice. 
The story and character development though really take the cake for this series. They are so well done and beautiful. There are some tear jerking moments, but they don't feel too bad.
 There's good humor and nice memories. It has really cute and wholesome romantic moments throughout it. Had several moments of smiling for ages at some of the cuter moments towards the end of the show. 
Another really amazing thing is, that the characters all feel relatable in some way. Had some memories of own High School experience
                  flash during some of this. Overall, beautiful show well worth the watch!",10
"
                What makes Toradora! so fantastic is how the show revolves around the development of the cast while the chemistry between the two lovers slowly starts to grow. At the start of the show, it slaps generic and cliché personality tropes upon the main cast, but as the story starts to progress, we slowly learn how and why the characters act as they do. The characters are not one-dimensional; they all have certain flaws that follow each of them. We get to see how the emotions of the characters slowly evolve and how they personally interact with them, whether it be hiding them, running away from
                  them, or even facing them head on. I believe that these interactions between the characters are what make them realistic and relatable.
It is really interesting to see the show's interpretation of what love truly is: an emotion filled with sweetness with a hint of salt. You really get to see the ups and downs of love that the characters experience individually. Love is a complex emotion, and you will see the characters get hurt by it in their own unique way.
Toradora! is truly one of my favourite romcoms to this day. 10/10",10
"
                I actually can't stand this shit. I usually love romcoms but there's something about romcoms that involve one person being in love with someone but ""heroically"" give up their love as a selfless act for someone else, similar to Sakursou no pet na kanajo. These two shows are actually very similar (spoilers for that show if you haven't watched) as they both follow the mc taking care of a girl who can't take care of themselves and eventually fall in love whilst someone else is in love with them. Anyways here are my main issues.
1. There was no fucking chemistry between Takasu and Taiga. It
                  felt more like he was her dad. He took care of her and everything but it didn't feel like romance. 
2. The art was pretty shit. I mean I'm usually one not to degrade a show because of that, and it's a romcom so it really shouldn't matter but it was pretty bad. Also, the thing with Taiga is she looks like a child so when she and Takasu kissed it didn't seem right. I really don't like all that weird-ass Loli shit. 
3. I didn't like the characters either. I mean, the character development for Ami was really good so she was fine. Kitamura and Minori were fine too except for the part where she let Takasu go so he could be with Taiga. The MC yeah a nice guy but is just boring, nothing stands out about him, so he's just an average MC just like all the others. Taiga though is probably my least favorite character. She's a piece of shit to others, just clings on to Takasu, and is straight up just annoying. Don't like her at all and that is that. 
Anyways, I still fairly enjoyed this show because I enjoy all romcoms, but only really the first half of the show or maybe after Takasu realized he was in love with Taiga because it really didn't make any sense to me. A positive would be the side characters. Ami was developed really well and I thought the Kitamura episode with the president was pretty good. Just the two main characters' relationship I really disliked. Overall I'd give Toradora a 4/10",4
"
                As of writing this I really should be writing the script to an episode for an upcoming radio show at my school. I really can't be bothered, and I did indeed just finished watching Toradora! for the third time so I might as well write my thoughts out somehow.
In Toradora!, while I find the characters not to be the most complex in the world by their design or personality, they've been given just the right amount of background story and flaws to work well in this kind of a story. The story is a passable but the thing that makes this series truly amazing to
                  me Aisaka's and Takasu's relationship's development. I don't really need to tell you why at this point (you should already know by now) but goddamn, seeing how these two grow to like each other over the course of those 25 episodes feels really special. The story is not realistic at all but by the end of the series their love sure as hell does feel real.",10
"
                This show really is a God among humans to be honest, compared to a lot of the shows now it's just amazing. It's a rare show that only really pops up every few years or so which just blows all the other romance/comedy anime out of the water. The only other show which I think has reduced me to tears like this is Clannad. Considering I'm a 23 year old muscular male and I cried my eyes out in laughter and in sadness really shows that this is a great show. Considering this is the first time I've ever cried to an animated show.
Story -
                  8
The story really isn't something too special, a high school setting like most other romcom series nowadays. However, the unique twist where the main characters don't like each other and strive to help each other is a really unique twist which makes the story interesting and quite unpredictable at moments. It always keeps you wanting to watch the next 2 or 3 episodes because you just want to know more about the story.
The only real issue with the story is that the ending isn't quite as good as the rest of the show and it feels like there is a few episodes which were stuck in there as filler almost (don't quote me, i haven't read the manga or the light novel) but these are quite easy to overlook as the rest of the show makes up for it, a lot of the themes seem quite unique and it is definitely a fun experience.
Art - 8
Considering this show was aired in 2009 the art was great, to be honest I think it could still hold its own against medium-budget shows today. The art seems to get progressively better as the series increases. The only issue really is some of the characters can look quite boring or similar. For example, a character Ami is basically identical to the student council president and it confused me a little bit. The art is fine though, but it isn't really the reason why people watch this show, but it is very nice nevertheless. 
Sound - 8
The opening and closing themes are really quite something, catchy and good to listen to. Even though the opening song was changed half way through the season, it was still a good song to listen to. The reason why it's rated so high is because of the music in the show. It has really strong and emotional pieces which can honestly make you tear up at emotional times in the show. During the final episodes is where this really shined and it can honestly make anyone shed a tear.
I've watched both the sub and dub, and I have to say the sub is better, but if you like dubbed anime, you won't be disappointed. The characters seem to feel slightly more real in the sub and Taiga's voice actress is phenomenal. The dub version is also great too, but if you want a better experience i'd recommend the subbed version.
Characters - 10
This is where this show really shined. The cast is minimal and sometimes this is a good thing. The show really only builds up on 5 characters and a few more in the latter episodes but it mainly focuses on the 5 mains. All of the characters are really well developed on and show deep flaws to them as well, which makes the characters seem like people rather than just characters. You can actually sympathize and understand the situations they are in because of this and it makes the experience a whole lot more emotional and great. 
The characters aren't really defined by a certain archetype apart from maybe Taiga who is the quite standard tsundere. The fact that they don't really fall into standard anime archetypes means it's a whole lot more enjoyable as a lot of the characters aren't predictable and you really need to watch to understand their motives and real feelings.
Even though Taiga is the run-of-the-mill tsundere she really doesn't feel like it later on into the series. Usually tsunderes can be quite irritating after a while as its the same old stuff,  but Taiga gets more pleasant to watch over time as you can really see her develop into a great remember-able and understandable character and really understand that she just wants to make people happy. This is where it really shines.
Enjoyment - 10
As I said, this show really is a God among humans and it was so enjoyable to me. If if you don't enjoy the romance genre this show will blow you away still as it isn't the run-of-the-mill romance. It has much more to it, and it is so funny sometimes and it is so sad at other times, it will really make you cry in all different spectrums. 
Overall - 9
I have to say, I think this is definitely one of the best anime I have seen, possibly on par with Seto no Hanayome (which is hilarious btw).
Even if you like the genre just a little bit, I really recommend trying this show out, compared to the crap that is made a lot now this really blows it all out of the water and it is such a good show to watch. The rewatch value isn't amazingly high as if you know the eventual ending then it kind of spoils it for you, but so far I have watched it 3 times and I have loved it even more every time since.",9
"
                I typically do not watch romance shows. I'll watch shows that have a romance subplot but the romance is not the main plot.
This was my first real exposure to this genre.
I enjoyed Toradora. I enjoyed it more than I was expecting.
I thought the character development/progression was great and the story was compelling enough.
Story: 8/10
I don't watch many romance anime so I'm not sure how much common tropes it falls into. But it did not seem like a typical romance full of cliches.The story takes place in a school environment so expect aspects of class life, festivals, holidays, trips, etc.
The plot felt a little slow at first. It felt like there would be an episode or two arc for a character's development and then take an episode or two break. It wasn't too terrible but some episodes felt like a drag.
The show really picks up after a certain event in the middle of the series. At that point, I really couldn't put down the series. 
Art: 7/10
The art wasn't ugly. It was decent. Nothing really unique about it. 
Characters: 8/10
The characters are developed quite well in this series. Each character has at least an arc where they get to shine. 
Some of the characters start off static. However by the end of the series each character feels unique.
Ryuji and Taiga both start off as interesting characters and they never stop developing. I really enjoyed the two sides of Taiga. She comes off as a hot-head at the beginning. When she's around her love interest in the show she shows off her extremely shy personality. At the end of the series, you get to see the real Taiga.
I didn't like Minori at first. She grew on me. Her relationship and interaction with Taiga was very touching. She ended up being one of my favorite characters in the show.
Kitamura was pretty boring. He was very static up until the arc where he dyes his hair. After that he was a little bit better. As a whole he was still not that interesting and my least favorite of the main cast.
I do wish Ami was a bit more developed. She had a character arc near the beginning of the series, but seemed to drop off after that arc. I wish there was more that they did with her character. I heard from a friend that in the manga she has another arc which develops her further, which is a shame that they couldn't include it in the show. She still comes off as developed though.
One thing I could not stand was the Ryuji's mom and the bird. They both in my mind are terrible characters. I don't think they served a useful purpose. Almost every time they were on screen was terrible. Ryuji's mom only has a tolerable presence in the last episode, and that is not enough to redeem her. 
They just irked me, and they are in enough episodes for this to affect my score in this area.
Sound: 8/10
The first OP is awesome. The background music is fitting. The ending for the first half is really good. The second OP and ending are alright, not as good as the first half though.
I watched the english dub, and everyone's voicework were excellent. No real complaints on the sound aspect.
Enjoyment: 8.3
I enjoyed the story and the characters in the series. Being that I typically do not watch romance anime, I didn't know exactly what to expect. I knew who the main characters would end up with, as I expect most will gather as well. However, I did not anticipate how they would end up to that point. There were plenty of twists and turns along the way.
My only gripe was the pacing. Some episodes felt slow. Nothing felt like filler, but certain episodes just weren't as enticing as others.
Pros:
+ Compelling story that avoids cliches
+ Strong character development
+ Genuinely funny at points
+ Touching moments
 Cons
- Certain characters underused
- A few bad side characters
- Slow at points",8

                What else can I say about Toradora except that it beats most other romantic comedies by far?  I enjoy many genres in anime, and am always looking for a new series to dive into.  I had seen some posts about this show online and became a little curious when all I could find were positive remarks about it.  I must say, Toradora is in a class all its own.  It is the perfect example to the world on how to make a romantic comedy correctly.  The story is told in the most ingenius way, and has some of the best
                  plot and character development in an anime that I have witnessed.  Toradora truly gets what love and teenage life are like.  It knows that love is something no one can ever predict and will do what it wants.  By the very end of the series you will have broken down and cried, felt happiness in the pit of your stomach, and have been in awe so many times, you will have lost count.  This show is highly recommended by me to the entire otaku universe, and to those who are looking for that special show that knows what love really is.",10
"
                I loved every second of every minute of this anime. Honestly my favourite anime . Why have another waifu when u have taiga :D . Honestly what made me love this was the way taiga changed her hate for ryuuji to love and her character development in general. Like I went from hating her in the first 10 eps or so, to her being my waifu. I dont even need to say anything about Ryuuji just flat out chad. Minorin i kinda wanted to win his heart at the start but i changed my mind half way through. This show was just a flat out

"
                I've been going through a divorce, and my wife left me on the first of April (jokes on me right?). A couple days after she left I decided to just watch some anime. I love anime and haven't watched it really since I was a kid (except for when ""Akira"" came out in theaters again). Anyway, I was on Netflix and saw a show called ""Toradora,"" and I thought the poster looked cool (I'm a sucker for advertisements). I started watching it and wasn't sure if I wanted to see a romantic show right after my split, but it is an amazing show. The plot
                  is fairly simple, but so is making a cake. You can use the simple ingredients to make something awful or memorable. The thing I loved about this show the most was that the characters (the main five certainly) were so fleshed out. Often in a story you have the main two (maybe three), and the rest are just window dressing. But here all five were living, breathing characters. I loved every second of it and even ended up getting a sticker on my car of Taiga peeking out of the back seat. I'd recommend it to anyone.",9
"
                Toradora!, a show that seems to be that the Love Cupid is on drugs and starts shooting his love-arrows anyhow.
Spoiler warning of course for those who have yet to watch, but I am assuming you watched due to this show is quite popular amongst the romance genre in MAL.
For a start, I guess this not that bad at delivering the 'romance' in a romance series. You should take this as a rare compliment from me as I am super uptight about the romance genre and will immediately have much hate for that series that failed to deliver what I wanted. With that said, I
                  will also say that the show didn't go the direction I wanted it to go as well. In the beginning, I hated the show, I was fucking disgusted at it. Our main guy Ryuuji was this virgin simp that sucked at dealing with girls, with contrast to Taiga a tsundere, it just made Ryuuji this pathetic main character we the viewers had to be tortured to watch. Thankfully, roughly about 5 episodes in the show started to improve on the characters, Ryuuji starting to gain some of Taiga's respect and Taiga starting to appreciate Ryuuji. I must say, the show does a pretty good job of giving us that Slice of Life moments, I definitely wouldn't mind watching these 5 goofballs just mess around after school. Additionally, I'm guessing this has to be a coincidence but, the studio somewhat took advantage of the time that they were in when making this show. For example, when Ryuuji cupped his hand Taiga's chest for the padding, like damn, if that were today this show would be on fire from the media. This show is made up of fun and serious parts and while I do appreciate parts of each to a certain extend, I can't help say that the show went a little overboard in the 'serious' parts. Like, they are supposed to close friends? Why are they having fights that are so intense, this is visible in the second half of the show. Plus some parts get so dramatic it feels so fake and scripted, I say scripted because this supposes to be the story about school life and all these dramas are just way over the realism barrier. In short, I have a love-hate feeling about the show.
-SCORES-
Character- 8/10: As much as I hated the 'Virgin Stage Ryuuji' and the 'Irritating Noisy Taiga' in the beginning, I'll say that one of the amazing things that this show has done is the character development. Like man, if there was a side by side comparison from the characters at the beginning as to the end, the differences are so major and that is a pleasant sight to gaze at. From initially thinking that Minori was this upbeat, care-free person to a friend that is hiding her inner self with a facade. From thinking, Kitamura was this obedient and sharp student to this funny, clumsy dumbass that straight up flashed his bush in front of females. Lastly, from thinking Ami was this fake person hiding her disgusting behavior to... her just having an open face about her disgusting behavior. Even the supporting characters like the teacher, Ryuuji's mom, the two female friends, and the two clowns Haruta and Noto. The studio just does a great job of building depth to the world, plus, if I am going to be honest, I wanted to see more of Haruta and Noto. Those two are what I define as being 'close friends'.
Art- 8/10: For animation like this coming out from 2008? This is seriously great work by the studio. However, in the beginning, people were scared of Ryuuji for his looks but his face didn't really give off that menacing vibe if I am going to be honest, especially when his behavior doesn't even show his 'bad guy' persona. 
Writing- 5/10: This has to be, by any means, the worst part of the whole show. While saying this is the worst, this is not to say I hate the entirety of it. I definitely adore those cute embarrassing moments when someone gets uptight in their feelings over the person they love. Or even those wacky and outright stupid moments like the part where they tried mimicking the Thai Hand Dancers while waiting for Ami. I certainly appreciate those, but there are the parts where it is overdramatic, overemotional and like, over everything. For example, the part with Ami and Minori getting all catfighting to the part where airhead Kitamura just straight up dye this hair to protest not to be student council, just to join back and get rejected in front of the whole school from his crush. Plus the part where Taiga fought Kanou just seemed so dumb, why would you force someone to love another if the person doesn't? Other than that, the whole show is just made up of back and forth plots like Ryuuji having feelings for Taiga but then this happened so the feeling got shuffled once again and now Taiga wants Ryuuji but Ryuuji wants Minori. I feel with plots like these, you are bound for some headaches on who wants who and why won't they just confess. These are what bring the show downhill. Plus, I honestly didn't want Taiga and Ryuuji to get together because the show teased us viewers so hard about a ship with both of them but it didn't work, so I was focused on Ryuuji and Minori and even that didn't work in the end. Truly, quite disappointing.
Sound- 6/10: While I think that the first and second intro fitted the mood of the show at the point in time, I do prefer the first and find the second quite mediocre. However, the vocals on the first intro just fall apart after the second half. The first outro, on the other hand, was fun and catchy with the second outro being fine. What annoyed me the most in the part was the OST, whenever a part gets emotional, boom, cue in the 'sad piano' or the 'sad violin'. Every time. Gosh was that such a drag. 
Overall, the show has some extremes but I am more to the liking side that hating so I guess it ain't all too bad. Just wished the plots were more consistent and not all over the place with stupid annoying emotions.
Decent to Light 6",6
"
                Toradora has good parts that are kinda good, and bad parts that are kinda bad. None of the show really stuck out to me as exceptionally good or bad though. 
The story is surprisingly complicated. Maybe complicated isn't a good word, but there are certainly a lot of moving pieces. There are 5 main characters (arguably), and we get to see a bit of all of them. The problem, I think, is that the show tried to show us too much. The series is chock full of forced drama. It's not that I don't like drama. After all, it's an important driving force for making
                  characters do things. Rather, the drama was about the wrong things. Most of the drama in the series is external, meaning that it doesn't have buildup and feels unimportant to the actual story. I would've really liked to see more interaction/drama between the 5 main characters, rather than outside forces. 
The characters themselves are a mixed bag. The two titular characters, Ryuji and Taiga, are actually maybe the least interesting. They don't really develop all that much over the course of the series, unfortunately. I found Taiga to be especially annoying. She is somehow beloved by everyone and a constant center of attention despite being an absolute menace. The other three characters do develop a bit over the course of the series, though I wish more time was given to them rather than focusing so much on the external drama I mentioned before.
The ending is especially disappointing. It was extremely unsatisfying and was a bizarre way to resolve things. 
There is some comedy in this show, but I wouldn't call it a comedy. Unless you think short tsundere girls physically assaulting people is funny. There is a pretty funny subplot about their teacher though. 
The art felt mediocre to me for a series from 2008, though I don't think art is especially important in a series like this. The soundtrack was okay, it did seem like one song in was slightly overused, though.",6
"
                I cannot truly say that I disliked Toradora! but I didn't love it, either. It's just... I never grew to love any of the main characters, or have real sympathy for them, and that, my friends, is a very serious issue indeed. 
I also kind of grew bored with the story at times, too. 
This anime is probably lower in my list than Kaichou wa Maid Sama! And that's saying something too. Because at least, Maid Sama! made me laugh a lot, and, although I did laugh with this one at times, it wasn't as enjoyable. 
              ",7
"
                In short, the perfect romance. Toradora! takes a worn out setting, a high school love triangle (square?) and elevates it. It has all the standard ""scenes"", beach party, pool lesson, skiing, christmas party, but none of them feel like stock scenarios. It makes you wonder just what other school rom-coms are doing.
If I had to pick the most uniquely awesome part of this anime it would be the characters. They all feel so real and interesting. Their interactions breathe life into the tired school setting. This is aided by the story, which is just different enough from normal school rom-coms, yet still realistic, to give
                  a place for the characters to shine.
The art is not hard on the eyes, but it's not Makoto-Shinkai captivating either. But that's fine. Not every anime has live or die on its art, and certain stories need different kinds of styles. The hand-drawn, not overly complex technique the producers use for Toradora! lets you focus on the emotions of the characters and the story without getting distracted by the background.
Finally, the soundtrack is amazing. I don't have much to say about the actual sound effects, but I challenge anyone to find a bad intro or outro used by the show, even though they changed both. On the contrary, the songs used in the show are likely to become some of your favorites. 
Toradora! is a show I sometimes wish I had never scene because I want to experience it for the first time again. That said, I still greatly enjoy rewatching it, especially switching languages. The show has an extremely good English cast, and the Japanese cast is headed by the legendary Rie Kugimiya. Some scenes are better in one language and some in the other, so even fans of Toradora! should check out both versions. My favorite anime.",10
"
                I'll be real quick, I absolutely love this show for how it stands out from other rom-com animes out there. Story, animations, characters etc. everything is just awesome. 
Its just I never knew that the love story of a Dragon [Takasu Ryuuji] & a Tiger [Aisaka Taiga] would be so much emotional and heart-touching as this one.
If you are a rom-com anime fan, you will love this show to its heart. I had a blast with this show. I laughed a lot, I cried a lot while watching this but I was always happy whenever I watched this show. 
By the end, I wanted to
                  cry even though I don't know why and maybe it was because of the fact I had experienced this kind of thing in my life as well. And so I am glad to have found this beautiful show that I could just with all my heart at peace.",9
"
                For starters, I objectively think this anime is not that great. The story is very slow-paced; especially in the slice of life genre that is directed to making audiences feel emotional from the get-go, the show is quite dry for the most part. 
With that being said, I believe that this anime is one of the only slice of lifes that I truly enjoyed. I have rewatched this series 3-4 times and see the deep meaning behind its slow plot points, dialogue, and dragging pace. Everything that J.C. Staff poured into this series has a meaning, and it is up to the patient viewer to
                  interpret it properly. Instead of being a shallow tug-at-your-heartstrings SoL (not saying it doesn't cause emotional pain, definitely does), the show focuses on the real and relatable aspects of life, while keeing its sense of surrealism and over-the-top comedy.
I love this show to death, I love Taiga Aisaka, and if there is one more complaint I have, they did Ryuji dirty as hell animation-wise. Please, they should have just adapted his look from the manga he be handsome af. Someone remaster this shit.",10
"
                I was alright with this anime I don't really enjoy a a lot of slice on life's or romance anime because I usually try to watch Shonen anime or stuff that has a lot of action in it. 
Story: The story itself is nice I liked the idea of how it was going and then things begin to change as the more you watch and new challenges face the main characters. However the ending itself was alright I definitely would've wanted some what of a better ending, but even though I would change it I like how they did it for the story.
Characters: I like
                  the characters of the story very much because they seem to be treated unfairly because of their persona in school, but as the story goes you get to see sides of the characters that most of the classmates don't see and for me I kind of liked it how some people seem hardcore, however they actually have a different side that they don't show to their classmates. 
Overall: This anime is a good Slice of life/ Romance I can see why that is always recommended for this genre of anime. I personally liked it for somethings like obviously the plot of the show even though sometimes it was frustrating, but that's obviously building up suspension. I would honestly recommend this to anyone who likes the combination of slice of life and romance it is a great anime for that.",7
"
                It is honestly not a big stretch to label Toradora! as quite possibly one of the most overrated anime of all time...
I am personally a big fan of rom-coms, so it is no surprise that Toradora! was at the top of the list of animes that I needed to watch after seeing the showers of praise the show gets everywhere online. I was also not disappointed due to high expectations as you might expect since I always assumed that the show was a generic high school rom-com that was overhyped due to nostalgia even before watching it, however the show obviously tries to be much
                  more than that. Despite being surprised at the show’s attempt to develop complex characters, it is ultimately just an “attempt” that unfortunately falls flat due to the inconsistent characters and a messy plot that barely holds the show together. (Since I will mostly be talking about the flaws of the anime, it might seem like I hate the show which I don’t.)
This review will be very long and will contain a lot of *SPOILERS* so skip to the end if you want a summary of my thoughts of the show.
Story - 6/10
The story of Toradora! is rather simple, and you should be able to get the gist of it in the synopsis. This is by no means a flaw, since I don't believe that every show needs to have overly complex plots for it to be enjoyable. However, the real problem with Toradora!'s plot is the horrible pacing issues that started to show up more prominently throughout the second half of the show due to the ham-fisted attempts at making the plot more complex too late into the series. I will be discussing more about the story/plot in the character section since they together form my biggest issues with the show.
Art - 8/10
Even if you have only seen the poster of Toradora!, you will already know that the art of the anime has nothing to really complain about. The animation is smooth for the most part and characters’ expressions and movements are all conveyed very well. Even though the art/animation is nothing ground-breaking, it is perfectly fine for the show.
Sound - 8/10
Again, the same with the art, the sound is well done but nothing extremely memorable besides the first OP which is definitely very catchy. All the voice actors did a fantastic job and there wasn’t any VA who didn’t fit with their character counterpoint.
Character - 4/10
This section will be quite long since I will be talking about all of the main cast, however mostly on the two MCs and their relationship.
The character I want to start with is one of the better characters, Ryuuji Takasu, even though his intentions and actions were always confusing, especially with Taiga (I will talk more about this in the section about Taiga). One of my biggest problems with Ryuuji is his label as a delinquent who is feared by his class-mates due to his intimidating looking eyes.
Being a delinquent or being misunderstood as one is a pretty common trait for main characters to have which is fine on its own, however this entire part of his character gets completely ignored by the second episode and is only used for a few jokes later on in the series. You might be thinking that this is no big deal and is a sign of the show and characters evolving. However, this part of Ryuuji is actually very important since it is one of the reasons he despises his father and it also sets up Kitamura’s character who is shown to be the only one who is not afraid of Ryuuji, which shows that Kitamura is someone who can see who people really are on the inside. This all gets set up in the first episode however without any doing anything or solving this problem on his own, all of Ryuuji’s classmates, even the ones who never interacted with him, suddenly stopped caring about Ryuuji’s intimidating looks within the span of a couple of episodes. This not only takes away from any development Ryuuji could have had with his issues but it also ruins Kitamura since when everyone is okay with being Ryuuji’s friend, Kitamura becomes noone special. Ryuuji is one of the better characters because he is pretty much the only character to get some form of a finished character arc that somewhat bares resemblance to character development, with his problems with his mother resolving after she finally accepts Ryuuji’s independence which allows her to let go of the fear that her own failures in her youth and as a parent would negatively impact Ryuuji.
Now to talk about the biggest problem that I have with the show, Taiga Aisaka. To be perfectly honest, I have little problems with Taiga’s character directly but rather needless inconsistencies made to her character and the overall story as well as the constant back and forth that happens with her character development. Taiga is considered by many to be a tsundere, or is she? A tsundere is someone who acts cold and then gradually becomes softer, tsunderes also are known to try and back out of their romantic feelings through violent tendencies. Taiga is definitely violent but her violence is never the result of romantic or personal feelings but rather the result of anger or hatred. Whenever she is talking to Kitamura (her crush) or Kushieda (her best friend), she always acts shy and end up doing stupid things. However, even after practically living together with Ryuuji, who clearly has always cared about her, Taiga somehow still acts hostile towards him. The show's attempts to push Taiga’s tsundere personality while also going against it at the same time only ends up confusing the audience on who Taiga is really supposed to be. But her attitude can be explained because Taiga always loved Ryuuji right? This is unfortunately also not the case because of the constant back peddling of the relationship between Taiga and Ryuuji as the show tries its best to blue ball the viewers on any development to the point of unbelievability. The first instance of the back peddling happens in the span of three (technically two) episodes. By the end of episode 2, the viewers as well as Taiga herself have realized that Ryuuji is someone who is always there for her, then in the very next episode, the development comes to a sudden halt as if the events of the previous episode never happened. This same problem happens again in episode 8 when Taiga shouts to the whole class that Ryuuji is hers which is a big step towards the development of their relationship together, or so I thought. Immediately by the end of the episode, Taiga makes a joke out of the situation and this entire event was never mentioned again for the rest of the series. The show stalls the development of their relationship again at the end of episode 13 when Kitamura shows up out of nowhere to dance with Taiga. This didn’t make sense at all in terms of the story since Ryuuji clearly tried to win the race to keep Taiga from feeling lonely (which is something he continued to sense throughout the episode when her dad abandoned her), however what could have been an impactful moment only left me confused when Ryuuji decides to leave it all to chance that Kitamura would keep Taiga company. This not only ruins the entire point of the whole episode but also makes Ryuuji completely break out of character for absolutely no reason other than delaying their relationship. The show then goes downhill after episode 13 when the development of the two MCs takes a complete halt as a result of the show’s desperate attempt to continue stalling out their relationship until the very end. The last problem I have is the entire relationship between Taiga and Ryuuji, which has always been more fitting as a brother-sister relationship rather than a romantic one. Throughout the entire series, we constantly see Ryuuji caring for Taiga and doing everything he can to help her. Taiga, on the other hand, does absolutely nothing for Ryuuji besides annoying and hitting him until the final few episodes. It always made sense for Ryuuji to help her since he has always liked cleaning and taking care of things (including his mother) and Taiga’s life is a horrible mess. However, it didn’t make sense for him to develop any sort of romantic relationship with her, especially because another girl who had feelings towards him is Ami, whose life is supposedly just as messy (based on her personality and the limited backstory she had in the show) as someone like Taiga, the only difference being that Ami actually helps and consoles Ryuuji when he needed it, albeit in her own twisted way.
Since this review is already terribly long, I will not go into detail with the rest of the main cast, who are actually much better written characters that are still disappointing for different reasons. Kitamura’s entire character arc is the worst of the three “side” story arcs. His entire arc revolves around him giving up on the student council because of his crush leaving the school, which is completely out of character since even though he joined the student council to be with the girl, he has been shown to be a genuinely good person, so ruining the student life of his classmates is not something he would do. Ami is actually my favorite character in the show (not because she is a good person but because she is the most interesting character) who was still disappointing along with Kushieda since both of them get only half a character arc without any sort of backstory.
Enjoyment 7.5/10
You might be surprised that I actually enjoyed watching the show despite the many problems I have with the characters and the story. However, the comedy in the show lands most of the time and some of the emotional moments hit pretty hard when it needs to. The best part of the show that really kept me going all the way to the end was the character interactions/dialog. Even though the characters themselves left me utterly disappointed, their interactions with each other is what carried the show for me and made it much more entertaining than it would have been.
Summary
Toradora! is a show that had so much potential as all the characters start out being interesting and unique, but unfortunately these same characters end up as half baked versions of what they could have been mostly due to the horribly inconsistencies in the characters and plots that left a bad taste in my mouth after finishing the series. Despite my criticism of the show, I would still recommend it only to fans of the rom-com genre, however if you don’t watch this genre regularly and is curious about rom-coms, I would recommend you try Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai instead (even though they are very different shows in terms of premise) which is an incredible show that does everything Toradora! tries to do but better; with a cast of well developed and written characters as well as a story that will definitely surprise you in many unexpected ways (as long as you don’t read any spoilers).",6

                Amazing anime rate 10/10
ABOUT: Taiga likes Ryuuji's friend and Ryuuji likes Taiga's friend they both team up to help each other to hook up with them. But instead of hooking up with the other's friend, the whole crew ends up in a whole lot of drama and instead they end up with each other instead of there friend and live happily ever after.
MY OPINION: It's a good anime in my opinion the art is outstanding. When I first saw Taiga attack Ryuuji in the class room it was pretty obvious that those two would end up together just like any other anime I've seen but
                  I still watched it anyway and it is fabulous. My concluding thought is you should watch it. You should at least watch the first episode or do the three episode test.",10
"
                Toradora! Is a great anime in general, let alone probably my favorite romcom of all time! There is a lot to love about this anime, the story and art are tight, great soundtracks, cute characters, and the best tsundere OF ALL TIME. Yes Taiga is a huge part of why I love this anime, and why wouldn't she be. While the MC is sort of bland, he does have pretty good character development. Taiga on the other hand is full of character through and through. She cute, angry, but has the sweetest side if you look just a little deeper. The supporting cast and last
                  2 or three episodes are some of my favorite pieces of anime of all time. Highly recommend this cute, if slightly campy story of the dragon and tiger.
These review lines stand pretty correct but i have dropped my overall from a 10 to a 8 after widening my scope",7
"
                I'm not going to bother with any spoilers, so don't worry about that.
The highest praise I can give this show is that when you're done you'll simultaneously want more and not want more. If you've felt this way before you'll know exactly how high of an appraisal this is. To love a full story so much you desperately want it to continue, but also wish for it to stay as is because, well, it's a full story, and you don't want an addition to come along that would ruin it. 
Now, I've seen some people saying how the characters are unlikable so they stop watching
                  and give it a lower rating. This is an anime from 2008, a time when some things, like character development, were still important. Nowadays it's common place for you to start with a character in a show and end with the same character, with the way they act and think being set in stone, and not really being changed by the events in the show. Sometimes it's better to have a character, or hell, more than one maybe, change as the show goes along. The character development and pacing is very irregular with this show, with a lot of buildup throughout (not that the characters aren't changing in the first 4/5ths of the show), and then a huge out pour in the last part of it. 
Another criticism I've seen is that it has a predictable end point and start point, and while yes, that's true, it's got 25 episodes explaining how you get to that point. Sorry if it didn't end the way you wanted it to, or that if you skipped the series and watched just first episode and last episode you could probably predict what happens after watching the first episode, but the point isn't to enjoy the end of a show, the point is to enjoy a whole show. There's so much to the way the story progresses, and I wish people could understand that just because an ending is predictable doesn't mean you can't enjoy something.
This isn't a review of the finer points of the show, there are of course flaws, but that doesn't matter to me. My reviews are about my enjoyment of a show. Maybe I don't see the discontent other people have because I don't see myself as the main character of a show, so I don't feel like I'm getting kicked in the head by female protagonist, but I also don't understand peoples' points with this either. It's an animated show, suspension of disbelief should be common place, it's obvious that whatever world they're living in doesn't have the same physical or psychological rules of injury as ours does since fever is more debilitating than a wooden sword wielded by a 4'11"" girl with the strength of someone who weight lifts often. What I'm trying to say is that, yeah, the relationship might seem unrealistic at times, especially for the male lead, but it's also an animated show, you can be empathetic or sympathetic all you want, but that shouldn't replace your suspension of disbelief. Not to mention it's just a compliment to the show of how much so many people are able to not only enjoy it, but also feel real emotional connection to the show even though it's got some moments where empathizing is difficult despite being a high school romcom, which is a genre made for putting yourself in another world.
It's absolutely thrilling, it's a show you'll be sad to have finished, and I'm sure that's where my want for some sort of continuation to happen comes from. I don't know if they'll ever make more about this show, and I'll be absolutely ecstatic if they did, but even if they don't I'll be happy I watched this show in its entirety.",10
"
                It definitely doesn't do this show justice just to say that it's my favorite Slice of Life/Romance anime, because I've been fairly vocal on my little platform about how I'm not a huge fan of either of those genres. Originally, Toradora made it onto my to-watch list simply because I'd heard nothing but praise for it. And I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed. 
I usually need a stronger backbone acting as a plot than just the romance itself, but this one is set up really well. Taiga and Ryuji complement each other very well, even just from the early concepts of their characters. A
                  pair of misunderstood classmates who've both gotten undeserved reputations based on their appearances. Ryuji-- the nicest guy around-- is frequently mistaken for a common thug, and Taiga has the appearance of a harmless little doll, but has, admittedly, pretty much corrected this assumption by the time the story starts and is now known for her short temper and violent reactions. I'm not sure if this is still the case... but I know there was a time that whenever tsundere were brought up, Taiga would be one of the first characters who'd come to mind. I was aware of this reputation long before I'd ever seen a single episode of the show. I know this will be off-putting to some, but personally, I've always found the tsundere archetype to be sort of fascinating. Their violent overreactions are almost always spurred on by an inferiority complex or some sort of personal insecurity, which makes them very interesting characters to try and dig deeper with. 
And in a way, that's what this whole show is about. The other piece to this puzzle-- and the thing that brings them together-- is that Taiga and Ryuji each have a crush on the other's best friend, and try to help each other out in their courtship. The best friends-- Minori and Kitamura-- I also found to be very likable and fun characters. Honestly, neither of them are developed quite as much as I would have liked, but they both also have that point to them: that they're not quite what meets the eye. One of my favorite things about Toradora was this sort of second plot underneath the main romance, where we got to see Taiga and Ryuji's classmates slowly overcoming their assumptions and accepting them for who they really are as they all spend more time together. It was usually very subtle, actually, and would have been easy to miss if I hadn't already been hoping for something exactly like it after Taiga and Ryuji's little shared venting fest during episode two. (So they set it up well.) 
The Slice of Life element to this show was blended really well into the romance and character development. Toradora was told in a very... continuous fashion. Most of the other SoL stories I've seen have been told in more of a snapshots fashion: the episodes being cut into mini adventures that don't really connect in any way. None of the plot points in Toradora just drop off. Our main protagonists are compatible in many ways, actually, and one of the big connections is that their family lives are both a little messed up. I really liked the shift in the latter half of the anime towards exploring that. Honestly, by the end, it was really more about friendship and family than romance. And throughout it all, none of the lessons learned through any of their little everyday adventures were ever forgotten. The ending wasn't exactly what I wanted... but I really enjoyed this story as a whole. It checked off the two most important points in my book at least: 1) Likable characters 2) who grow over the course of the series. So I can definitely see why it was so well-loved, and will echo that sentiment: If anything at all about this premise sounds intriguing to you, this show is definitely worth your time.",8
"
                Characters have depth. Which is, like, where most romcoms fail, and this one doesn't. There are flaws here and there, but Toradora has nice pacing and balances comedy and romance pretty well. It does overstay its welcome bit. And the finale, without going into spoiler territory, is just weird and tries to create too much drama out of thin air which ends up being kinda unsatisfying compared to what it could be.
But I like these characters and feel for them. I believe in Taiga's inner struggles and definitely do not considere her a bitch. If there's any criticism to be said about her, is that
                  she's made too cute which is honestly a bit weird: vulnerability of a person doesn't feel sincere enough when that person actually looks like a child.
Also, I don't get why Ryuji's mom is portrayed that hot. It could be a comedy trope, I guess, but the show never plays off it. Ryji also refers to her by name a lot, which sometimes created as weird feeling like this is going to be some kind of a weird hentai-like stepmother/stepson scenario (which it isn't).",8
"
                Toradora is one of the best romcom, it is very funny to see it is an very interesting experience.
Toradora characters have a character development in a good way. Taiga is a character that evolves during the story advance, Toradora is a romcom that is very different to the others. This series  is one of the romance series that has least clichés and forced  or incofortamble scenes. 
I my own personal opinion toradora is a funny romance anime and also is a must watch anime. I think that you cant skip this anime if you are going to watch a lot of anime.
Also toradora
                  is one of the classics.",9
"
                *EDIT*
The show gradually built up relationships between the characters until it builds up into a crescendo and then the obvious thing happens. I liked all the characters they all played their part in moving the story along and provided an overall really enjoyable
apart from that, I have watched this anime three times as of writing this review and even the third time it still was really good. The sub is way better than Dub, I fell like the dubbed version misses out on the feel of the show in certain places.
I'm glad I rewatched it was and still is an amazing show which I recommend
                  watching, even though the ending leaves you wanting more and I am even gladder that I re-rewatched it because I missed the after credits scene the first two times I watched the show, this fixed the issue I had with the way it ended though I still would get hyped if they ever decided to carry on the story and take  us further into their life as a couple.",8
"
                I watched this anime when I was younger and started watching again now, what I can say about this experience is that I was able to enjoy it much more.
The beginning of the story seems to be a bit silly and focused on comedy but the direction manages to present the characters well in a subtle way and as it progresses we see more layers of them and this enriches the story.
Around episode 14, the plot begins to unfold a lot, the arc of Kitamura is very strange at first, but ends up being the turning point of the story where the characters are already
                  well defined and the main drama of the anime that has always been inserted of subliminal form comes to the fore leaving the viewer well instigated.
Finally, the romance is well dosed, is cute to watch and the couple has good chemistry making you really want to cheer him on, but at the same time he doesn’t completely run over the story, respecting the context of the characters bringing a good ending coherent and satisfactory.",9
"
                Like all romantic comedies, Toradora is full of flaws. Yet, I still enjoyed all of it. I loved the premise of it. You know right off the bat that the two main characters will end up together, you just don't know how. I love the characters for the most part. Taiga has a more natural and unique feel compared to a typical tsundere. This can be said for the others as well. The characters feel natural and unique.
Here's the problem. Like all romantic comedies, there is no real story. There's only the destination. That's not the actual problem, the problem is the journey. It's just
                  every day problems building into a big problem, then that big problem gets solved. It's usually a problem that can be resolved with any form of communication too. We hit the reset button and start over again. It just seems like we're going around and solving each character's problem one by one until we reach the end.
Now, for my one pet peeve. My one true issue with this entire series. Every time a big confession, big moment, or anything significant would take place, there was always an interruption. Phone calls during conversations, convenient arrivals (inconvenient for us, but convenient for the story), or just some form of milking the audience's attention.
Despite these two flaws, I couldn't help but feel empty after it ended. There wasn't enough. Like Clannad, the ending felt rushed and packed into one or two episdoes. Like Clannad, I didn't get to see enough of what goes down after the fated couple end happily ever after. These flaws, however, are in just about every rom-com. That's the only reason you can forgive it. It's an unwelcome cliche, but it'll always be around. I still enjoyed all of it, nonetheless.",7
"
                Toradora! is a rare exception to a rule that I've often held, wherein I choose not to watch high school anime, as it often feels like a poor reflection of reality with vague statements and highly unrealistic plot points to fill many cliches. 
Where Toradora! veers from the standard romance anime tropes is the portrayal of painful moments in youth that don't end happily in many instances. While the manga is still on indefinite hiatus the plot of Toradora! from beginning to end runs to set-up a fairly believable story of growth and love for damaged individuals, from it's supporting cast to the main characters
                  of Takasu Ryuji and Aisaka Taiga. Both main characters have self-doubts whether it be Ryuji's issues with his appearance and demeanor as a delinquent, or Taiga's issues with both her petite size and overly aggressive facade. 
Character's background stories are well portrayed; though do still fall into the flat story-telling that is often used to project a character's flaws in a manner that still feels ham-fisted from time to time; often written off as one line interactions from ""His eyes are scary!"" or ""She's tiny and her bust is tiny too!"", which admittedly feel unoriginal in every way. Where some of these story lines do succeed is in the motivations of each character; particularly in the supporting cast and resolution of their issues.
Motivations in Toradora! are perhaps best summarized into the categories of ""Daddy issues""; which are made abundantly clear in some early exposition, but also are seen in the more realistic concerns of growing-up. Where most high school romance anime focuses only on the romance and issues within, Toradora takes moments to portray the fear of growing up , which is perhaps the most relatable and visceral malady the characters face. Love in Toradora! is a key motivator, but it is not the backdrop for growth in characters which is it's greatest storytelling device. Characters act out of petty crushes and try to warrant their behaviors, but in doing so develop far more than a simple confession scene would ever naturally yield to. 
Seiyu work and OST work in Toradora! ranges from wonderful to absurdly out-of-place in some instances, which does some work against the overall narrative. Of key note, Rie ""Reigning Queen of Tsundere"" Kugimiya provides my favorite performance of her career, with the most emotional monologues and outbursts in the show. The tone of the show as heavy-handed does feel out of place when presented with scenes of a homeroom teacher resenting her lost youth, or a parrot that blurts obscenities and miming it's best death thralls. Of particular note ""Vanilla Salt"" as the first ending theme and ""Lost my Pieces"" played in key scenes work to bring out the shows intended themes properly. 
Animation in Toradora! is fairly average, the art being fairly generic in most episodes; which is in no way a disservice. There are few action sequences which do feel out-of-place, but not in a manner that derails the show, and instead are more a natural consequence of the characters and feel a necessity to progress the story. 
Toradora! has issues, which like it's characters are worn on it's sleeve and visible after a few episodes of viewing, but is something that for fans of slice-of-life or romance feels to be required watching. The ending is problematic only in that I genuinely dislike endings with questions left over. The manga is ongoing, though the Light Novel is available fully transcribed in English for reading, and does resolve any lingering plot points. 
Overall, Toradora! is a great viewing experience with some light issues; which I rewatch every year whether alone or with a significant other. 
Toradora! gets a solid rating of:
Your mom is kind of hot, bro / Ten unrequited crushes",8

                The first time I watched the anime was maybe 5 years ago? before I rewatched this time my favorite character was Minori Kushieda, honestly she isn't that great at the first half of the show but she's become my absolute favorite character of all time from the last 2 minutes in ep 23 and first 2 minutes in ep 24 *you know that stunning scene that we can't discuss because no spoilers allowed:(* btw she's still my fav lol but this time I realized Taiga is really amazing character, her developing was interesting, what she did in the last ep blow my mind because it's
                  really real, this show isn't just a romance cutie story, there's other important stuff beside love too like friends, family and taking responsibility and that's the thing I didn't notice it from my first watch. 
I can see myself rewatching it after another 5 years and still liking it.",10

                =- This is an Anime Noob review -=
I am someone who has only recently gotten into anime, and though im quickly going through more and more entries in my new addiction hobby, bear in mind that my experience and my opinion are based purely on my current interaction with whatever it is i am reviewing. I do not base it on its history, its impact, etc - because i am not aware of it. I review it based on me simply watching it, and enjoying or not enjoying it. There is no such thing as bad anime. Only anime that some people like, and anime
                  that some people don't. Im here to provide reasons why i liked or disliked something, not to mark it as bad or good.
=- The review -=
Wow. Toradora. This anime was NOT what i was expecting.
To give you a small idea, i dont give out 10s easily. 9 is the most an anime can get from me, assuming it does everything perfectly. 9 is the perfect score. 10 is different. 10 is what i give to something that remained with me for a long time after, something that i kept thinking about again and again. Something with big personal value.
I went in to watch Toradora as a quick romcom laugh flick. I did not expect much. When i came out, i could not watch anything else for a few days, because i just kept thinking about it.
Toradora is a.... special show. The first half of it is some of the best comedy you'll see. Its easy going, well done and very enjoyable. The cast is varied and works great, giving you a good glimpse into their personal lives, as well as reasons why they are the way they are.
But slowly the show changes. Comedy becomes less common, and more serious issues begin coming up. And thats when you realise that Toradora is not a comedy. It is a mirror of what one can expect from life. We smile when we remember good times, the laughs we have with friends, the jokes we play on each other. But not everything in life is happy.
Toradora does not pull punches. There is heartbreak. There are emotions. There is sadness. But the worst (best) part of it is that its all real. Its all believable. Its not the ""He got into argument with his friend, and now she wont talk to him"" stereotypical anime sadness, its the ""Sometimes your feelings will get trampled and spat upon"" sadness. Its the ""Life is unfair, even if you do everything right, you can still get screwed over"" sadness. Its the ""I know exactly why this is happening, and i know exactly how this will go badly, but there is also nothing they can do about it"" sadness. 
The comedy you see early on hooks you to the show, to its extremely varied and rich cast of characters, and explains what's what and who is who. And then, the real story begins. A sad, depressing and absolutely amazing story.
The pacing, the presentation, the way characters act - all of this is absolutely beautiful.",10
"
                *SPOILER ALERT* 
(Preface) 
The lens of nostalgia can sometimes act as thick wall, running counter to objectivity, or evolving preferences. It's to say that the memories of what we love, may in fact be more satisfying than the things we love in actuality. It isn't to diminish the values or merits of something we hold dear. It's to understand the power of our sentimentality to heighten the emotional potency of something that may mean a lot to us. I preface this review in this way for a specific purpose. In many ways, my satisfaction in watching series' that were new to me, paled in comparison
                  with revisiting the classic staples that have moulded my preferences. It's normal to have favorites, and to derive great joy in them. But to let the favorites of the old, stagnate the satisfaction of the new? It had been a bit of a struggle in my anime watching. It brought me to a place of frustration, yet simultaneous open mindedness. It was a place of ""This stinks... but I have nothing to lose."" And this sets the backdrop for my first experience with ""Toradora."" 
""Toradora"" tells a relatively familiar story, romantically speaking. Ryuuji Takasu is by all accounts, a fairly ordinary guy. He's got a good heart, a relatively chill demeanor, and to flip things on their head a tad, the face of a stone cold killer. His home situation is slightly dysfunctional at best, and his social landscape is primarily relegated to his best friend Yusaku Kitamura, because most others are afraid of him. Our other main character is Taiga Aisaka, she's got an aggressive streak and a bit of a Napoleon complex. Ryuuji and Taiga's paths cross coincidentally at school one day, when Taiga mistakenly puts a love letter meant for Ryuuji's best friend, into Ryuuji's school bag. Embarrassed by the whole ordeal, Taiga becomes aggressive with Ryuuji, until the two vow to help each other with their respective love lives. Ryuuji has a crush on Taiga's best friend Minori Kushieda, and to keep the ""wrong school bag"" situation under wraps, Taiga agrees to help Ryuuji with his crush, while Ryuuji repays the favor. 
With the relative simplicity of the overarching plot, there's a lot of opportunities for the story to branch out, and the characters to evolve. Additionally, there's a lot of different directions a story like this could go, without any one particular way being the ""right"" way. Some anime may really delve deeply into how well the characters get to know their crushes. The story could pave the way for a ""happy ending,"" in that the initial aim of our characters was met. Our protagonists ride off into the sunset with their early series' crushes, and reap the joys of that experience. A well constructed anime can depict many different endings competently and effectively, no matter which way it may go, that's not in question. In the case of ""Toradora"" however, what really stood out to me, was the realistic direction it took with respect to the dynamics of a relationship, and how love tends to unfold in the real world. 
""Toradora"" can really be boiled down to the sentiment that; ""The essence of love, must be deeply rooted in friendship."" While Ryuuji and Taiga work towards their goals of love towards their crushes, they simultaneously mutually share in meaningful experiences with each other. Being neighbors, they eat meals together, go on walks together, and share mutual friends at school. Though they are not to be thought of as a couple, on their terms, they are by all accounts sharing in life with one another. Love being rooted in friendship stands in stark contrast with the relational dynamic one may have with a far off crush. The awkward exchanges and jitters are at times less indicative of love, and more akin to incompatibility or a lack of meaningful time spent together. When romantic interests are put on pedestals, they cease to really be peers that we may enjoy for who they are. They instead become ideas and placeholders for a standard we feel like we cant attain. It isn't to say that we can't or shouldn't go out with these people, it's to say that the attitude and posture behind these relationships is wrongheaded. This is what ""Toradora"" seems to expose, and I love that it does so. 
As the series goes on, our protagonists come to the realization that true love implies comfort, and is deeply rooted in the experiences that they have shared with one another. Both Ryuuji and Taiga become good friends with their respective love interests, but never in a way that's convincing or indicative of anything further romantically speaking. Love is in the ordinary and the mundane of the little things. It's in the banter, the laughs, the mutually shared joys and stresses that pave the path of life. This is what Ryuuji and Taiga share. And it's only in pursuing the flipside of their shared experience, that they find that there is no other romantic reality worth pursuing. Strong relationships are built similarly in the real world too. When we look first to date a crush, or an ideal person from afar, we discount the important and essential bedrock of friendship. The sparks exists for but a time, and without the knowledge and shared experience with another, there is no bedrock. The most successful relationships start perhaps with the hope of dating in the long term, but hold tight to the joy of friendship in the meantime. This is the nature of Ryuuji and Taiga's relationship. And any romantic ambitions they had towards each other, took a great deal of time, and introspection to truly come to light. In this way, ""Toradora"" tells a story of two divergent souls, who find their way towards each other. 
With respect to the characters, I cannot say enough to truly describe how much I love all the characters in this series. It's not to say all of them are lovable, as much as its to say that the creators did a wonderful job depicting them convincingly and meaningfully. Taiga is a tsundere that achieves the delicate balance of aggression, and softheartedness. Her anger is rooted in fear and insecurity, not malice, and this becomes clearer as the series goes on. Some tsundere's can be over aggressive, to the point where we can't see the deeper sensitivities that exist. This is not the case with Taiga, and it makes her a character that's both relatable, and convincing. Ryuuji is a great guy, and a perfect counterbalance to Taiga's aggression. He's fairly reserved, very kind, and has a protectiveness towards Taiga that underlies their relational development. The supporting characters are all fantastic too. Taiga's best friend Kushieda is competitive, driven and emotionally complex. Ryuuji's best friend Kitamura is a cool dude. Academically driven, student council president, ladies man. All of these characters have a diverse set of experiences, strengths, flaws and other characteristics that make them unique, and valuable to the story. 
The visuals in this series are beautiful, and the color palette gorgeous. Nothing to complain about there. 
The music is lush, emotionally moving, and fitting for each moment of the series. The music did a fantastic job of evoking a strong emotional reaction from me in tandem with beautiful scenes. 
In getting back to the nostalgia preface from the beginning, ""Toradora"" has pulled me out of a rut, so to speak. It has revealed to me the absolute joy of enjoying the new of a moment, and not always just the former of the past. I've been challenged to embrace newfound stories, instead of longstanding memories. Both are so needed and necessary. The old we love will pave the way for the new we come to enjoy, and ""Toradora"" has been the ""new"" that I've been searching for for a little while now. 
All of this being said, ""Toradora"" is the best anime I have ever watched, and my favorite of all time. That's right. If you look back on my first review, I reviewed my ""favorite anime of all time."" I didn't think I would ever watch anything I love more than ""Chobits,"" but I'm thankful to have been proven wrong. Nostalgia is a warm blanket, but can also simultaneously serve as its own set of blinders. I'm thankful to have dropped my guard, and to have been whisked away by a story that moved me deeply, in a way many others cannot.

                So i'm not the biggest fan of slice of life anime but so far i liked the few ones i've seen. My criteria in choosing an anime is picking one from my huge list at random and i kept avoiding Toradora because i thought it's gonna be a long and boring slice of life especially since it was old but boy was i wrong.
I'm not ashamed to say that it had a huge emotional impact and bring me to tears at a lot of times.This quickly afterwards became one of my favourite anime of all time and i strongly advice others to go and watch
                  it as well.I personally enjoyed every episode but had some friends that were bored at first so for those i advice you to keep on watching and you won't regret it.Many call this anime the mom of romcom anime and i agree.This was the best romcom anime i've seen",10
"
                I loved it, it was my first anime that I watched, I chose it mostly because of the cover, I love lolis and taiga is really cute. And I love romance.
I expected a good romance story and that it was. It made me laugh, the start of the school year is so wholesome and always cheers me up. The festival was a lull for me though I didn't like it, but it picked up again after. the ending was sad.
The art was alright, It's not the best that I've seen but it is an old anime.
I liked the soundtrack, the piano was sweet, and the
                  ending vanilla salt.
I said I loved lolis, but I dislike tsunderes, and taiga is too mean sometimes. And ryuuji is a sweetheart eh.
While I didn't like all of it, but it is still at the top of my list because I can rewatch this and still feel those emotions I think that's important too.",9
"
                Description:
The holy water of rom-com anime. The original. The basis of Tsundere cliché in rom-com anime. Meet our protag, with scary eyes. Meet our female main character, who is small and violent. Meet supporting cast members: Happy go lucky girl with bonkers, and rich girl who is a total bitch. The character lineup made this show great on it’s own, and it’s ability to make you cry, well, it’s great.
Opinion:
For a long time, this anime sat as my second favorite anime. It was eventually dethroned by Nagi-Asu: A Lull In The Sea. Why was it dethroned? (Now it’s My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU) Simply because,
                  I believe when I first watched it, I loved the show so much, I labeled it as my second favorite anime of all time, when I hadn’t seen that much anime, and I think I was just in an emotional state from the ending. However, I recommend Toradora with my life. If you haven’t seen it by now, you are making quite the mistake. Toradora was ahead of it’s time.
Recommendation:
Seriously. I bet my life. Watch this show. Watch the ending. CRY. C R Y. It’s that good. I can’t express how good this anime is. It is number one out of my top ten for a reason. WATCH. PLEASE. Arigoto.",10
"
                I find Toradora unreasonably likeable.
The art is as acceptable as it can get and the sound offers nothing spectacular.
The show starts on the wrong page, as a story about a violent girl bullying a very generous and patient boy. The initial bullying dropped onto him is so over the top that it's off-putting. Quickly though, the plot tones down on that and get on the typical rom-com direction. With the ending being evident on the very first few episodes, the interest ends up being ""how"" rather than ""if"". And while I think the series could've used less forced drama and more character development, I still
                  think it turned up very enjoyable.",9
"
                Honestly, with Torodora I have mixed feelings. I have said before, I'm not really into romcom animes, but this one was hard to judge. I Love the anime design and op 1 is my favorite so first, the op and the Character design wins for me. The thing that i DISLIKE is, the plot happened so soon in he anime. IDK if this makes any sense, but when I watched it at first I was like: ""oh here goes another all happy and no plot anime"", but then i watched the second part and I was like WHAT?! I mean from the jump I just
                  thought it was your typical tsundere and the boy who everyone is scared of anime. (SPOILERS), i knew Ryuji and Taiga would end up together but I never knew why taiga was living by her self at the start, then the story goes on with explaining taiga's backstory.
I know how I like the design, yet on the other hand I hate Ryuji's mom design. How they made her a grown woman with a womanized body and she acts like a child?! Doesn't really make sense to me. Same with his dad, to be honest the story didn't really go in detail about his dad that much in my opinion. Anyway overall I give the anime a 8/10 and no changes.",8
"
                A lame concept but the execution was far too blatant and in-your-face, with some bizarre writing decisions. Terrible approach to slice of life, lame villain, awful direction in general and a disaster of an ending. I dont like the music. Also there were so many small mistakes and things that didnt make sense, it all added up to something completely terrible. Every single minute was painfull and it really took me all my willpower to finsih it. also I didnt like the mol and the manitz and the sth and  Ithink that it is really and sometimes it wasnt that muich of a something
                  also I really thouight and expected that this would be it, but it wasnt. Very sad  and doesnt make sense at all because of what happened before, since that was the main point of the story. like actually. well i thibnk thats it",1

                This review contains SPOILERS, as I give a detailed explanation of why I think the story is bad and what was the point in the story that makes me think that this anime is not recommended to watch. This review is intended for those people who are looking for a more ""real"" romance or one that makes more sense in my opinion, the review contains an explanation of why the ending and the story in general seemed bad to me. you are WARNED if you haven't seen this anime yet.

I give this note for the simple fact that it is a very predictable plot, unless you are looking to see ""one more love story"" I would not recommend that you watch this anime. The ending of this romance is predictable and without much to prove, it basically has no plot twists and it is not difficult to know how the characters will end.
The ending disappointed me a lot, because being predictable I thought it would be better.
(this is not a summary of the story I'm just explaining why I don't like the ending moderators, please don't downgrade my review)
Personally, I believe that the story of both protagonists fleeing and then marrying and that in the end none of that happens and that everything ends where it started is a waste of time and a pointless argument that does not contribute anything interesting. It would have been better, that both protagonists did not end up together and that only Ryuuji managed to achieve her love with Minori. As long as Taiga ended up alone and maintaining friendship with others or having another love outside of the protagonists, there would have been no problem seeing that Taiga if fell in love with Ryuuji, but that Ryuuji did not reciprocate beyond that the plot wants to show that for him The fact of the time that Ryuuji and Taiga shared both end up falling in love, when it does not necessarily have to be like that and they can end up being a good friendship without any problem and in which only one or neither has aroused feelings for each other.
Conclusion
I am not a screenwriter and I am not an expert in stories and character development, but from the beginning the viewer can discover through their own conclusions and just by watching the first episode of what is the only important argumentative twist that this anime has. If you see the first episode, the conclusions that can be drawn are that either both of them end up with the people with whom they are in love, only one of the two manages to be with that person and the most obvious is that both protagonists end up falling in love with each other.",2
"
                This is great. Definitely worth watching, but it has SO MUCH wasted potential. For example, Ami is introduced and I was personally invested into her and then the show just decides to forget about her...? Why not add another episode to add more context. I also hate the ending. The tsundere girl did not deserve the guy over the other chick. She's literally the worst while the red haired girl is an angel. 
Other than that, everything is great. I like the characters (expect for the main girl), the sound is great, art is even better, and the story... It's good until the last quarter
                  of the show.
Okay, well that's my opinion. See ya!",8
"
                *Review has spoilers*
Story 7/10
This story has a lot of potential, given that is somewhat realistic and you can actually believe the outcome that happens (meaning, Taiga and Ryuuji fall in love with each other because of spending so much time together while ""trying to help the other be with the person they think they like""). It was only natural that something like that would happen.
Art/sound 7/10
I don't tend to focus too much in art and sound, but this anime looked nice (I didn't see anything too careless about the drawings).
Characters 6/10
I found Taiga to be very annoying and self-centered for the most part. Taiga came
                  across to me as feeling she was entitled to everything and was very rude to an undeserving Ryuuji 99% of the times. I know her aggressive behavior is meant to be cute or funny, but to me, is it not. As I read in someone's review (so sorry I can't remember who, to give the credits to), but if it had been the other way around, Ryuuji calling Taiga ""a bitch"", ""puppy"" or hitting her all the time, that would be considered gender violence and not too nice. I understand Taiga's emotional issues come from being neglected by her parents and not being taught emotional intelligence, but she could have done better, like many people do. I have absolutely no idea how Ryuuji could put up with Taiga. Must say though that I was really moved by the episode in which Taiga realizes she doesn't need her father disappointing her all the time, that she is better off alone.
Ryuuji in the other hand seems like a very nice kid. In my opinion, too permissive and tolerant of Taiga's behavior. He was always taking her care of her no matter the many insults that she would give him. I was like ""please Ryuuji, realize what a bitch to you see is!!!"". He seems to be a caregiver, but needs to learn a bit about boundaries. It was very funny for me to see how he loved to clean and take advantage of supermarket discounts like an old lady!! This was probably my favorite part about this anime. I also liked how he could sew someone's dress without thinking it is a female gender role.
The other characters are not very too important to me. Minori was weird and awkward, while Kitamura too me had hidden fetiches (ex. the Christmas episode, what's up with his costume?), he loved to be naked and people looking at him while at it. Ami, although rude and bitchy at times, seemed to be the more down to earth and mature character, at least aware and embracing of her emotions.
Enjoyment 6/10
Mostly because Taiga was too annoying for me to watch and believe she was the main character.
Overall 6/10
I read reviews comparing the anime to the light novel and it seems the anime left out a bunch on tiny stuff that would have made a lot of sense as to why things happened in the anime (such as Ryuuji proposing they elope, Taiga leaving Ryuuji and Taiga's return). I don't know this person, so this is no promo or publicity, but I will copy+paste a link to an article that discussed in great depth the main differences between the anime and light novel.

"
                10/10 without a doubt. The anime starts with a comedy but after a few episodes the story starts to become serious, emotional and surprisingly more romantic. The characters are very well developed. For someone who is interested in Comedy,  Romance Anime this is one of the best for them.
Story(10/10)- Involves a ordinary guy named Ryuuji Takasu(Dragon) who looks like a delinquent and a short and short-tempered girl named Aisaka Taiga(Tiger).In most of the anime short girls are always so strong or feared by many ,that's Taiga a.k.a Palmtop Tiger. While Ryuuji only looks scary(Referred as Dragon), but in reality, he's pretty harmless.They decide to
                  help each other to reach their own goals i.e., Aisaka will start helping Ryuuji to get in relationship with Minori(friend of Aisaka) and Ryuujii will help Aisaka to get in relationship with Yuusaku(friend of Ryuuji). I can only tell this much that as story goes forward it take many turns you will really enjoy it.
Art(9/10)- Graphics are rather unusual but very good..which I would say, Graphics are unique, that's for sure.
Sound(9/10)- The openings and endings are pretty much good and the background musics are also pretty much good. Nothing special but nothing wrong.
Characters(10/10)- All characters are very well made and the character development is also good as the story goes forward.
Enjoyment(10/10)-  I enjoyed every single episode there was, some were very memorable but few are forgettable. I personally, enjoyed every minute of the anime which included comedy, parodies, romance, and some parts were very sad but not as emotional as Violet Evergarden. Toradora! can make you have ""watery eyes"", but Violet Evergarden can make you cry.
Overall(10/10)= Toradora! is not really recommended for everyone to watch, but Its highly recommended for fans of Romance/drama/comedy anime with a bit of sadness. If you bought it, its worth every penny. Anyone looking for some romance, then this could be your answer to that question. If you watch it online, its worth every minute and if you downloaded it, its worth every bits of data.",10
"
                Toradora is a show that starts off fantastically, then around the middle it begins to falter and finally by the end of the series it dives head-first into the pavement.
In my opinion, the characters and their interactions carry this show. All main characters are fairly complex, and part of the series' appeal is how we find out more and more about what makes them tick, and watch their personalities evolve. Both work incredibly well initially, later much less so, as ""evolution"" is replaced by sudden, inexplicable change, and much of the interaction from the first half simply... disappears. We'll get back to this later on,
                  but first allow me a few words on the individual characters themselves.
Taiga is a terrible human being. I'm not sure I'd want a friend like her, not to mention a girlfriend. But she is still portrayed as Human, her behavior has reasons behind it, and you can tell that in her own way she does treasure those who manage to put up with her attitude and temper. She's really interesting because while I don't especially like her, I can still clearly see why others would think otherwise.
Ryuuji is a great guy, but is honestly a bit of a doormat. This allows him to get close to Taiga early in the series, but his lack of agency also becomes aggravating quickly. I've lost count how many times another character talked to him at length, and all he managed to spit out in reply was ""well"", ""I"" or ""wait"" before the other person turned around and left. And he didn't mind. Thankfully this passiveness of his does get better with time, and his character arc is perhaps the only one in the series that is unaffected by the nosedive happening in the second half. On the comedic side, he's a great ""boke"" (look up ""tsukkomi"" if you don't know what that means) and his obsession with cleaning adds numerous fun moments to the show.
Kitamura and Minori, the crushes of the above two leads at the start of the series, also serve their roles quite well. 
Kitamura acts a bit like an older brother to the others, while the fact that he'd known Taiga longer than Ryuuji (and the audience) adds a bit more mystery to his character. His arc is also the one that completes the earliest, before the show really starts going downhill, and the end of it is really satisfying. Unfortunately, the creators visibly had no idea what to do with him afterwards, and he pretty much disappears from the plot from then on.
Minori is your typical ""genki girl"" on the surface, but as the series progresses it starts unveiling a lot more depth to her character, until... nothing happens, sadly. Minori's arc suffers greatly from the events of the second half, and we only catch glimpses of what could have been. She's still a lot better off than Ami, though.
Who's Ami? Glad you asked. Ami, Kitamura's childhood friend, is introduced as something of a wild card to the love polygon of the previous four. She has the outsider's point of view on many of the group's problems, which adds a new dynamic to their interaction; her character is both like and unlike Taiga in many aspects, with great flaws, but also numerous redeeming qualities and signs of gradually changing for the better. Then the second half starts... and her arc is almost completely abandoned, to the point that you have to wonder what she was actually supposed to be doing in the series at all. She easily has the most wasted potential in the show.
So what was actually happening in the second half of the series that has me up in arms to such an extent? On the surface, nothing much. Toradora did what many other, wildly successful shows did before and after it: started raising the stakes, and putting more emphasis on drama instead of comedy. Nothing wrong with that. The real problem is that while the series' success in comedy was largely due to the well-crafted characters listed above, for whatever reason it tried to be successful at drama while sidelining many of the main cast and warping some of those that still retained the spotlight.
Taiga was unrecognizable for much of the second half. At first, she at least had an excuse for acting differently around the Christmas arc, but afterwards... she simply stopped being herself. I was shocked myself when I realized that I'd actually prefer the violent Taiga to make a return instead of... well, words fail me to describe what that was. One thing is for sure: this was not character development. Character development does not work like this; someone's personality does not change drastically from one episode to the next, with little warning or reason. I suspect the intention was to earn some sympathy points for her by making her look more vulnerable, but they kind of threw out the baby with the bathwater.
Kitamura, Minori and Ami, on the other hand, were barely present. As I wrote above, the writers simply had no idea what to do with Kitamura by that point, while Minori and Ami were sacrificed for the sake of the drama: Minori actively avoided everyone else for about 10 episodes, while Ami's role was reduced to making passive-aggressive comments at anyone who dared to approach her, then storming off shortly after. 
You simply can't have an effective plot and believable drama with only the two remaining characters, especially with Taiga only being a shadow of her former self. It just doesn't work. 
The ending? Can't really say much without going into spoilers, but I'll just leave this here: the series covered the events of 10 light novel volumes overall, but the last volume was only covered by the final episode and half of the penultimate one. Draw your own conclusions.
What went wrong? In my opinion, Toradora suffers from the usual pacing issues that adaptations of longer-running titles tend to experience, but the core of its problems were not introduced by the adaptation itself and stem from the source material. They say you don't realize what you have until it's gone - perhaps the light novel author did not realize the secret to her series until she effectively blasted apart everything that made it work? Or perhaps I'm not being fair, since it's not like everyone hated the series' conclusion - so let's just say that it did not work for me, to put it mildly.",6
"
                Let’s begin! I came into Toradora with a very sour and dreaded feeling as I had previously tried to watch the show in the past and had dropped it then. However, upon hearing about the show again from new friends, I decided to give it another shot of a watch. 
I began with the rewatching experience and quickly realized that I still felt the same as the first time around. My strong displeasure for the overly aggressive tsundere characters grated on my nerves and it made me more upset with how the show carried itself. 
It was your typical love triangle/pentagon whatever drama-filled show where
                  love never went as planned but because you already knew the outcome of the show before even watching it, the drama was very draining. You knew the two main protagonists were going to end up together so you end up being like the blue-haired chick in the show, filled with irritation about how the characters keep creating drama scenarios for each other with the “I’m gonna make this relationship happen” attitude. As a very lackluster filled show, I wasn’t invested in any character, which is sad to say as I always end up having at least one favorite character. 
I dreaded the entirety of the show until reaching episode 20 where we finally started reaching the climax of the show. I didn’t become invested in the show at this point because of the drama or the characters’ romance, because I still didn’t care. I became invested in the small discussion of family that was had in these episodes and it was the only part of the show that had me crying. I got to see the struggle that a single parent would go through to assist their child in trying to achieve their dreams and how that same child will feel guilt for the actions the parent takes. That’s all that improved my image on the show at all. The show sat at a 5/10 throughout everything but those single moments from 20-24 bumped it up to a 7/10 as it was now enjoyable.
As for music or animation, I didn’t really have much to say for any of it. I didn’t take note of the music which is a bit disappointing, but alas that was probably based on my lack of interest in the show. However, I will give props to the animation when the characters cried because that animation was gorgeous. As much as it could have been more moving, my lack of investment in the characters never made me feel much emotion for them.",7
"
                The first time I watched this, I watched it in dub. But for the first episode, I watched in sub, then by accident moved to dub in the second episode but the thing is, I didnt even realise! That has never happened to me before (with the exception of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood) for me to watch a show and not realise the language is being spoken in a completely different language from the previous episode! Thats all I can say about the voice acting, it THAT good! The voice actors nail their roles so well in the dub that I cant choose which is better,
                  the dub or the sub? I have watched this show about 4 times now. each time I change from sub to dub or vice versa depending on which one I watched through last (I cant remember).
As for story, there is no other romance anime (and trust me, I have watched a LOT) that has given the main cast so much character development over the entirety of the show as well as Toradora. The story is about how the two main characters try to help each other get with the people they are in love with. And through that main aim, they spend time together, forming a friendship and a better understanding for one another. The show starts off with a more comedic focus to the plot, but that drastically changes in the second half when focusing on the two main characters conflicting desires and confusions within their feelings. Each arc in this show are great (with the exception of Kitamura's two or three episode delinquency, imo at least)! And all of them impact the main characters greatly in the long run e.g. Someones perception on a certain character might change or a realisation of how hopeless a certain situation regarding love is might occur (idk, these are just examples, I'm tired. don't judge me).
As for animation, it's fairly above average. With the various surprise increases in quality here and there e.g. the fight scenes. The art style does compliment the animation though, making it pure eye candy a lot of the time. Of course, it does have it's drop in quality in the less important scenes but seriously, every anime has that.
Since this is my first ever review, I might have missed some stuff to talk about and since it's late at night and I'm tired, it's getting hard to think coherently so I apologise if this review isnt very helpful to you. But I spent a good 20 minutes writing this review, so I'm gonna copy paste this on myanimelist lol (I did, yay).
Overall, this anime is a must watch, especially for romance fans like myself. 5 stars, 10/10 for me.",10
"
                Jesus Christ just Confess Already!
Maybe it's a me problem. Maybe I just don't like ""will they won't they?"" type shows, But 24 episodes for a confession of love is annoying.
It's very melodramatic, but that's not really a complaint. What is a complaint is the Characters. They're fine, Ryuji is interesting, the Tiger is annoying for the first half of the show, Glasses is boring, Red-Haired Bubbly is cool, and the rest is fine.
I just really dislike the Story. I've always disliked shows which the climax is the confession of love, and everything that builds up to it is the characters stewing in their own love.
                  
It also might just be me drifting away while watching, but it feels like they didn't explain everything. The two biggest things were I  didn't understand her Christmas Speech before she met Santa, and I didn't catch what Glasses told Taiga during New Years. That's also a me problem probably.
The other thing I majorly Dislike is the ending. 
-SPOLIER WARNING-
So they decide to get married.
bruh
They haven't even kissed at the time they wanted to get married. Like, it's High School, chill out.
And then Red Girl gave them all the money she made, Really? 
Like, this is a terrible plan why are they agreeing to this?
It also ends on a non-ending, which is just perfect.
Overall, my main problem with it is it just doesn't seem noticeable. It's just very generic and forgettable. I don't understand why this specifically is one of the most popular romance anime of all time. 
The only other romance anime I've watched is High School Host Club and Mysterious Girlfriend X.  And both of those are leagues more interesting with MG-X telling it's story in much less time.
So Finally, it's fine. I gave enjoyment a Six cause it was Half n' Half me liking what's happening on screen and me laughing at the screen. So it's fun to watch if you want mostly-lighthearted fun-times, but if you haven't watched MG-X, watch that instead. It's got some stupid fanservice in the later episodes, but it's much more interesting and funny.
It did have a Yugioh reference though, so I guess it's a 10 now.",5
"
                I personally think the show has it's good and bad moments,,.
The show is really cliché and all but it also did touch me while I was watching a few months ago..
The art is AMAZING! I think the characters design's were adorable!
The OST aka Sound was Outstanding!! Loved it!
Characters... Didn't really love much. 
The main reason I am giving this what I gave it is because of the female lead. I know the show is like a Cold Woman/ Warm Man type of thing but the female lead aka Taiga was wayyy to dramatic and rude at points.
I know Taiga is suppose to be a ""tsundere""
                  or whatever and this show was 13 years ago but... her character wasn't cute at all a lot of times--
I didn't get that annoyed at her while watching for the first time but, now thinking about her character, It cringes me out
I enjoyed watching it! For the cliché that it is, it was fun to watch!
Overall, I recommend you to watch if you wanna binge a romance high school anime for no reason.",7
"
                I will be honest and brief, this anime is horrible, I really regret that I lost those 10 hours of my life that I will never recover, the plot lacks emotion except in a couple of moments, the characters are flat without any charisma and their relationships are very toxic
the truth I can not find anything salvageable from this work it seems so bad that it would leave any generic isekai in a masterpiece
I do not see the meaning of this work it seems like the producers did not agree that they wanted to arrive or they all suffered from toxic relationships throughout their lives
the
                  truth this anime I do not recommend it at all there are many other anime anime that are worth more
I clarify that this is my opinion if you like Toradora nothing happens is completely valid and I respect your tastes I do not understand them but I respect them
I see myself saying A LITTLE LOVE OF YOUR OWN TAIGA !!!",1
"
                TLDR: Watch a better anime romcom like Fruits Basket (2019), Kaichou wa Maid-sama!, or Kimi no Todoke. If you've seen all three of those shows then maybe watch Toradora! but I feel like it's very slow and not worth re-watching.
I'll try not to spoil anything major. I was skipping through the pointless sections of Toradora! episodes to get to major plot points as I felt like it was wasting my time. I enjoyed some parts of Toradora! mostly Kushieda's antics which got me to laugh out loud and repeat the clips a couple times. But the story just drags on and on.
If you're going into
                  this show for a good romance anime, this show fails in that regard. There is no slow buildup of their relationship where they slowly find out they might like the other person and test the other person to see how they feel. None of that! Instead we get one episode almost near the end of the show where one of the outside characters [Character C] just tells [Character A] that [Character A] likes [Character B] because [Character A] doesn't know this themself! Wow! And only after this ""reveal"" do they start getting embarrassed and shy around the person they're supposedly in love with. If anything this should have been done much earlier, not close to the end of the show.
Why would you give one character in your show 3 love interests and then have that character only start caring about one of those interests because someone TOLD them that they should?
One of my biggest gripes with the show is that Jealousy is the only thing moving the plot forward. It's as if that's the only feeling the author has ever known in their love life. You could have cut out so much from this show by having the characters confess their feelings, get rejected, and then move on!
Also the whole ""we're gonna run away and get married"" part of the show was incredibly dumb. Writing this review has made me want to rate it even lower than 5 but I'll stick with 5/10.",5
"
                Toradora is a very romantic animé portraying the story of how Ryuuji and Taiga fall in love. It is heartbreaking, funny and romantic.
Story wise this is nothing too extravagant, especially since it spoils the ending at literally the beginning of the first episode. This animé is more about the having enjoying the story along the way. This of course doesn't make the ending bad at all, on the contrary, I found it to be a very romantic and very satisfying ending. It progresses (the story) with characters going through many encounters, some bad, some good and portraying how the characters become closer to some and
                  less attached to others. The way I put it does sound rather mundane but in reality this is actually very amusing and will get many reactions from you.
Art is crisp, quality is great and there is never any drop of it.
Voice acting is phenomenal, truly making every episode full of emotion. Music as I remember it was great and added to the already emotional setting. It was very thematic, fitting well with the presentation and story.
Characters were great, showing many emotions and being very dynamic, each changing in their own way. Friendship and trust are shown to be very important aspects throughout the story.
I thoroughly enjoyed the animé, it was funny and very emotional and is one of the best love stories I have seen in a long time.
9/10 Fantastic",8
"
                Toradora is an anime about a guy and a girl who are polar opposites.One look cute but is very aggresive while the other looks very tough and intimidating(idk thats what the anime says lol) but is very kind.This is a slice of life anime with 25 episodes or could be like 26 or 27 idk.(Just checked its 25).Fairly short and good for a beginner since its mainstream. Taiga and the other guy i forgot his name cuz he is cringe but so is the other girl get closer as they try to help each other with their crushes.Simple plot tbh.DO NOT WATCH THIS ON DUB
                  unless ur a cringe master. I give this anime a 8/10. Made me smile but pretty cringe sometimes.The ending feels like its rushed as well.",8
"
                There were only 2 reasons i started watching Toradora. 1. Because it was so popular 2. Because of Taiga Aisaka, and let me say i enjoyed every second of this anime. As someone with the world's shortest attention span it's rare for me too find anime (or just anything really) that keeps me entertained. I'd usually end up pausing it half way through the episode and start scrolling through my phone or I'd usually have to force myself to continue watching the show but with Toradora, I didn't do any of that. With Toradora I actually wanted to continue watching and i would never pause
                  and episode and i would usually watch multiple at a time without getting distracted.The story and characters grip you in and you cant help but enjoy this amazing love story between Taiga and Ryujii. I promise you will not regret watching this amazing anime that has easily become one of my favourites, 10/10",10
"
                The last time I had such mixed feelings about a rom-com show was, bizarrely enough, the show New Girl (yes, an American tv show, sue me). 
The ending left me with a bad taste in my mouth(it's a happy ending, albeit a messy one). I think that boils down to the fact that the pacing in this show was just straight-up bad. Like the writers had no fucking idea how to pace a romance. I mean, the whole fucking point of a romance anime is to give you good build-up, then pay it way off with the characters who were obviously getting together from the
                  start, well, getting together. But the way this show does it is so fucking bizarre and then when it finally does have them get together, it throws you a pointless fucking painful curveball that despite what some may tell you, doesn't serve any ultimate purpose, and was probably there to just to be fake-deep. Also there's a decent amount of male-fantasy bullshit sprinkled throughout.
This show has some really interesting characters, which make it worthwhile. The two side love-interests are super interesting and for once a show makes you feel genuinely bad for the ones that get left behind (a la Honey and Clover). They start off as trope characters but quickly turn into real people, with real feelings, and that coming out is super great, and it sucks they had to be framed around the two main dumbasses.
Ultimately, the main romance ends up super rushed and (almost) feels like it came out of left field. It's not the main reason this show is worth watching, but it is still nice to get that obvious Anime payoff.
For being the main character, Ryuji's whole character is:
-my dad left me
-I hate being the kid of a teen mom
-I like cleaning
Taiga is your basic ""ooh I act tough but really it's just cause I've been hurt by my family"" story. 
Both are serviceable, and they are admittedly super cute together. But they probably should have gotten enough depth to justify this being two cour.
Evangelion tropes(I compare everything to Eva):
-Boy with scary estranged dad. 
-Boy who likes to cook and clean for the hot mom and girl he likes, both of whom he lives with
-Taiga is almost just Asuka but smol. Her hair is even almost the same lol.
-Boy puts up with physical abuse from girl he likes 
-Girl has to sort through her family trauma before she can reach out. (Toradora paces this piece probably the worst of any element in the show)",7
"
                I had plans for watching toradora anime from… probably 5 years ago 
And I’m glad that I didn’t watch it at that time, because I should confess that my taste sucked at that time, so I probably wouldn’t have understand this show
Usually in most stories handling a love triangle is very hard, not only it can hurt the character development if used poorly but it also can become frustrating and annoying because the author might try to make things a little …. “too spicy” (god knows how many of us hate those garbage harem tropes that are poorly used in many anime and get in
                  the way of everything by the excuse of “love triangle” and “conflicting relationships”) and in this way completely destroy the balance between the love triangle, the plot and character development, and I think Toradora has successfully avoided these problems, and arguably even perfectly avoided the love triangle problems (at least near perfectly imo)
Although technically in toradora we have some kind of a “love cube” (not sure it’s even a thing or not) but it’s nicely executed anyway 
*This review has two parts, the first part doesn’t contain spoilers and the complementary parts that are tagged in spoilers are there for the people who have finished the show and want to know the things in an analytical detailed fashion about the criticisms and praises in the review*

[Story]
...............
The story revolves around takasu ryuuji a high school student who has some kind of “Yakusa type” face with scary eyes (inherited this kind of face from his daddy) which makes people mistakenly believe that he is some kind of delinquent and bully (even though he is a nice and kind guy), and currently there are only Kushieda minori and kitamura yusaku who are not afraid of him, and our protagonist takasu has a crush on this energetic highly spirited kushieda which is the friend of a tiny short girl named Aisaka taiga who has a crush on kitamura (the friend of takasu)
And for some kind of….“Event”
[spoiler]
 (takasu mistakenly receives the love letter that was supposed to be in kitamura’s bag, and taiga attacks his home at night to “silence him” so that no one else gets to know about her crush on kitamura) 
 [/spoiler]
takasu and taiga meet each other and find out about each other’s feelings for the other person’s friend; therefore they plan to help each other for confessing to their lovers and start dating them, and from this point onwards many things happen
[characters] 
.......................
Like most of school/romance/slice of life anime the real selling point of the show is its characters and the main cast are really great, The show has great personality variety from minori’s energetic behavior,
[spoiler] 
 to ami’s arrogance and selfishness,
 [/spoiler]
 to takasu’s supportive nature and to taiga’s shyness and aggressiveness, I mean everyone has great personality what’s the problem? 
YUSAKU...
Oh, I forgot kitamura existed……
Kitamura yusaku isn’t a bad character but I think he’s a lost potential, unlike other characters in the main cast whose character arcs instantly starts from their first appearance kitamura’s arc is somekind of a separate and self contained arc that takes a portion of the story and then ends before the show’s conclusion and this mainly raises two problems, first is that it’s not in tone with the flow of the show, the other four characters get screentime to shine in the process of the story, from minori’s part time jobs to ami’s “adult” behavior in school, but kitamura until the start of his arc is just the vice president in school who taiga has a crush on him and he’s a bit of a pervert comic relief, he has his moments because just like I said he isn’t a bad character but he is badly overshadowed by other character’s presence because they have more screen time to shine  and their character arcs starts from their first appearance and ends with the show itself.
[spoiler]
Yusaku’s dim presence in the show before his own arc about the president is mostly devoid of foreshadows for his later growth, in ami’s case we have her talk about takasu and taiga’s relationship far before it even gets obvious to themselves foreshadowing the events that are to come(after her appearance we instantly get the stalker part), for minori we have her trembling scene in the shed and her part time jobs which instantly click when you find out that she was working so hard because of…. Well many reasons (from not wanting to be depended on others to achieving her goals which needs money)
And for taiga and takasu I don’t think I need to mention any specific scene or thing they are the main focus of the story, but for kitamura the foreshadows about him being in love with the president start from 1 episode before his arc starts, it’s suddenly revealed that he had a crush on student Council president (arguably that’s the reason he played like a total idiot when taiga confessed to him) a side character who until now we only saw two times… not a very convenient way for starting an arc which you could easily set things up for from the first episodes imo… 
And after his arc ends there is no information about kitamura and student council president’s love life, because she’s just overseas, and his character arc ends, not having a clear conclusion may be a bit too subjective to criticize in an analytical level (I personally didn’t like the way their arc ended, the student council president suddenly becomes a key character in a main character’s character arc and after that she just vanished like she even didn’t exist) but it was still weird and annoying, not having clear goals and points in that arc makes me think the writer placed that arc there so kitamura can have a character arc for himself just like the other characters in the main cast
[/spoiler]
The side characters are not bad but it’s not like saying they couldn’t be done better (takasu’s mom, taiga’s mom and dad could be better imo), their screen-time is short and in a high portion of their screen-time they only have comic relief and comedy roles not some kind of development/progression type of role (where they function as something more than a typical background character that is only there for the sake of being there), they are far better than many romance anime background characters because the subtlety in showing their personal lives (as small as it is) makes them actual people if not necessarily people who the viewer actually understands and loves (I especially liked the subtle details about high-school background characters like kihara and tube-chi and that other glasses-kun with brown hair) 
But there is something that I want to mention: is it only me or everyone thinks yuri-sensei is annoying? She’s such an absurd character (always moaning how she doesn’t have a boyfriend that it becomes just who she is, it becomes her whole identity, just a teacher with boyfriend obsession/complex thing) that I personally think the comedy parts about her were too exaggerated that the comedy parts become her only identity, and as a result any time she tries to be useful in something other than being a comic relief it doesn’t match with the image the viewer has from her, because suddenly making a very thickheaded teacher say something serious in a very dramatic situation (because it’s devoid of balance between her character traits) it makes the scene absurd and it doesn’t make the scene impactful or resonating at all
[spoiler]
I’m not personally a fan of the way that the author handled taiga’s father arc, the only reasonable foreshadowing we get for taiga’s father being a jerk is minori’s reactions because she is the only person in that situation who seems both knowledgeable and serious enough at the same time, taiga’s reaction when she first meets her dad might be interpreted in the way of taiga being too harsh on his father because his father says he wants to “supposedly” make things right, takasu’s actions who never has seen his father are reasonable because it’s natural for him to want his friend (getting to account his kind and supportive nature) experiences the love of her father, something he himself didn’t and will never be able to experience, the beginning of this arc is promising and actually I liked it until this part a lot (maybe because I also have severe parental/familial issues) but from that part onwards I think there was a bit of lost potential (keep in mind it’s not bad, I loved the race scene and taiga coming to terms with her father leaving her again)
As I said the only serious foreshadowing for taiga’s dad being a jerk is minori’s reaction, yasuku’s(takasu’s mom) reaction to taiga’s father’s sudden appearance doesn’t work because most of her reasoning behind being suspicious of taiga’s dad is just selfish illogical reasons like “I don’t want taiga to go”, which is a shame in my opinion, rather than portraying yasuku as a knowledgeable experienced person (take into account she was dumped by takasu’s father and has somewhat of a similar experience) she is just babbling selfish things, which cheapens both the impact  of the foreshadowing and her overall character’s impact/presence and usefulness because she doesn’t even get that much screen time and the main screen-time/characterization she gets is in the end of the series (takasu’s father cheating on her with another woman and leaving with another woman being revealed), she’s not a bad character but I think she could have been used better because her presence in the scenes she is in is also dim(except some really well done parts like her role in the final episodes with overworking and that stuff onwards, I liked that part a lot)
It seems the author didn’t actually cared that much about taiga’s familial problems because it’s just revealed with one dialogue that her father leaved because he got bankrupt and her mother just comes in the show for two minutes and then everything related to taiga’s familial problems is solved off-screen, the reason why taiga’s dad suddenly just comes to “supposedly” make things right is not even revealed because “he’s just an asshole he’s selfish and doesn’t care about his daughter’s feelings, treats her like and object bluh bluh bluh…”, so why he would even give a shit about acting like he wants to make things right (twice) and then dump taiga? Does he enjoy it? What’s the case with this dude why the fuck he just didn’t vanish sooner? I mean I can’t see why he would want to “supposedly” make things right (twice) and then dump her daughter (twice) wasting his own time in the process when the only thing he achieves with doing this is guaranteeing another kick into his balls from his daughter for the next time he sees her (which makes it clear that if he wants his balls to not be exploded by taiga he should never see her again), it’s not saying that the show necessarily needed to explore these things in depth but a bit more subtlety and care would have enhanced the experience in my opinion, the show is still great and fantastic on the things it’s good at though 
[/spoiler]
[The love triangle/Cube thing]
.........................................................
But now we’re going to the main part I think Toradora did great, the love cube
There is a problem in many works of fiction (anime specially) that is very relevant which I personally call “The over-exaggeration and overwhelming of traits” 
It’s a situation when a particular/a few particular traits in a character are so exaggerated that it completely overshadows the character’s other traits and overwhelms them, making “who they are” a very shallow and problematic thing, in many love triangles the obsession the characters have with the girl/guy they love becomes so out of control that it becomes just who they are, just obsession and one sided dependence (keep in mind it’s different from creating a character who is maddened with love but is a well done character because the writer knows what he is doing with making the madness for love the root of traits and creating connected traits to that in the process, good examples of this type of usage of madness withsomethig(love, excitement and joy, etc…) is kinzo ushiromiya(madness by love and dependence) from Umineko: when they cry visual novel or Beatrice (obsession with excitement and hate of boredom) from Umineko)
And it’s a problem that toradora completely (imo) avoids 
Rather than the characters being just some kind of stupid obsessed person with their crush they maintain the balance between their own established personalities and their feelings, making it a very well done situation in many ways with avoiding the cons of love triangles and using it’s pros. The character’s personalities are not overwhelmed by stupid exaggeration of their love making their love feel natural and real, without sacrificing their development, the show doesn’t try to throw bullshit cheap dramatic effect into the viewer’s face in the love triangle part and when you find tension/crying/depression/ disappointment/heavy atmosphere etc… in the show for this matter it hits very deep if you really care about the characters because the author knows how to make good and realistic yet interesting and well written character relationships, I think toradora is almost perfect in its most brilliant aspect which I think is it’s love triangle/cube and the relationship between the people who love each other, after watching the anime I kinda got why many people want a second season even though the anime is finished in the same part that the light novel did (it’s just what I have heard though, I haven’t read the LN myself, correct me if I’m mistaken please)
[spoiler]
Ami loves takasu because he is the only person who found out about her facade and real self (she being a very selfish arrogant person) and wasn’t completely disappointed because of her expectations from her (she’s a very popular model, many people love her fake personality, when it’s revealed, no one likes her anymore), takasu even encouraged her to be her true self (probably the reason she openly teases takasu, because it’s who she is, and knows that takasu accepts her, showing a side of herself very few people even know much less accept), that’s why she doesn’t force herself to takasu and wants him to do what he wants, be with the person he loves, she learned from takasu to be honest with herself, so she can’t expect takasu to don’t be honest with himself, the reason why she doesn’t try too hard for obtaining takasu’s love (she’s the most imperceptible in her love with takasu compared to the other girls who openly confessed their love, but she did it more subtle in a way that a thickheaded person like takasu might not have even understood) because she’s also (arguably though, minori might have found out quite soon too) the first person who understands taiga and takasu’s situation (that they love each other), and therefore she doesn’t force herself to takasu despite visibly supporting and caring for him
And what I just wrote was just the gist of how great the love cube’s chemistry is and only for one of the characters
Minori loves takasu (from when exactly? We don’t quite know) but even from the start she encourages takasu to protect taiga (considering that she cares about her friend so much….. right?) to be with taiga and make her happy, but she herself also loves takasu but that doesn’t mean she is going to stop working for her own dream (the softball dream, the reason she has so many part time jobs), the vacation arc, the Christmas arc and taiga’s dad arc etc… make her personality completely visible for the viewer and the author doesn’t throw her personality out the window (unlike many romance/love triangle/ harem stories) for the sake of using her and creating cheap dramatic scenes (the crying waifu for the sake of it), she wants taiga the person who wasn’t loved in her whole life (familial problems) to finally experience love and that’s why when she sees taiga in the Christmas arc crying, she can’t accept to be the only happy person when her best friend (a person she arguably loves as much as takasu, platonic or romantic? Interpret that in any way you want) is crying for takasu’s absence. She is kind and energetic but the fact that she wants to obtain her own dreams with her own hands (not being dependent on others for these matters) and wants taiga to be happy with takasu (as she said herself, taiga is the person who needs takasu the most, when taiga was broken from her parental issues minori couldn’t save her, but takasu came and helped taiga to come to terms with her life)
 And that’s why she wants taiga to be with takasu, considering that takasu could even do what she (taiga’s best friend) couldn’t do for her best friend
Taiga and takasu’s character arcs are relatively more obvious to the viewer (because they are the hero and the heroine, always in front of the stage) so I don’t think I need to praise their brilliance too, because I’m lazy, or maybe because my favorite characters in the show were A-min and Minorin , or maybe both…
[/spoiler]
[Art] 
.............
The art style is pretty good too; the animation can be a bit annoying in some parts (mainly just one particular fight scene with wooden swords in the end of kitamura’s arc) but it’s not something surprisingly bad like the weird downgrading quality of shinsekai yori’s animation here and there, it just sometimes becomes a bit strange in scenes that have heavy movements 
[Humor and comedy]
......................................
I liked the humor in this show, 
[spoiler]
(from minori’s radar for finding cute girls to taiga putting her finger in ami’s “uncensored” nose)
[/spoiler]
 it doesn’t go out of its way to shit on the show’s serious parts but successfully makes an interesting contrast between the show’s tones, some episodes are also mostly comedy focused (taiga’s pull scene to some extent) but the show even uses the humor in those episodes in the benefit of the characters, overall I think the comedy is pretty good in this show
[Enjoyment/Conclusion]
......................................
 Ladies and gentleman, do you care about character development in a romance anime? Do you like subtle thematic details in the show about different subject matters? Do you like well written character relationships? Do you like good character writing? Then you will 95 percent enjoy this show, I want to be honest and admit that I am a bit harsh on this show for a few reasons (a bit of a lost potential in the taiga’s father arc and some side character’s usage that I talked about in the spoiler parts) but when the show shines it shines the brightest and when it’s turbid a bit it’s not the most cloudy one by any means, it’s pros outweigh the cons in my opinion and I like this show a lot",8
"
                Contains spoilers
Story: 5
The story is just a typical highschool romance. Pretty generic with nothing standing out so it gets a 5. 
Art: 7
Pretty average most of the time but is definitely good at showing emotion on the characters face, and the fight between taiga and the student council president looked pretty damn good. This level of art has me wondering how they fucked up opm season 2 so bad.
Sound: 5
Nothing memorable at all about the sound at all.
Characters: 7
Characters were pretty good in general, but I don't like how everyone is so indirect. Like kitamura, for example. He's like ""oh no my crush is going overseas?! Fuck it, imma dye my hair so I don't become president and I am not gonna tell any of my closest friends why."" 
I don't remember her full name but amin or baka-chin was a character that I hated and also liked at times. In general she has an unlikeable personality, but I think she said some much-needed things to some of those annoying indirect characters I mentioned earlier. That makes be like her, but the only thing I hate her for is her giving Ryuji shit about playing dad or something. Maybe I just don't get it but apparently being nice to taiga is playing dad? tf? He was literally just being nice and she wanted him to stop playing dad before someone gets hurt. What is he supposed to do, just completely change how he behaves? Well, all that stuff about playing dad didn't really have any consequences anyway so whatever.
Enjoyment: 8
Despite the average of the prior sections, this was very enjoyable. The characters were real enough to get me invested and wanting to see them being happy together, which was enough to get me to continuously click the next episode button. The only thing that sort of ruined it for was taiga deciding "" fuck it, imma head out and fix my family WITHOUT consulting the literal guy I am in love with but oh well, he trusts me so whatever"". On that final episode I was like, are you shitting me? At least it was a happy ending after the credits.
Overall: 8
I only really care about enjoyment when it comes to an anime, unless it is REALLY bad and somehow I still enjoy it like arifureta. So even thought the average would be 6.4, it is overall an 8. This show could have been really good with additional character development and an example of a show that I think does this better is sakura-sou, which I recommend and I think is better than toradora",8
"
                Though this is based off a simulator game, this anime is perfect regardless and can be very touching. You won't be disappointed too much at all and half the time you'll be either laughing or at the tip of your seat waiting to see what happens next. If anything the only disappointing part is something I can't spoil but should've happened much sooner.
Most anime will not come close as good as this anime. If anything be sure to have yourself a tissue box if you are sensitive as a person. (If you are attached a lot to the characters that is). This anime is not
                  overrated and should be watched.",10
"
                *Spoilers to follow*
It's crazy that a single plot decision can take something really good and really turn it into a mess, trashing theming and characterization in the process. Unfortunately, in order to explain, I need to dip into spoiler territory.
Our male and female leads, through some early plot shenanigans, join forces in order to help each other with their respective romantic struggles. The middle block of episodes really shine with this premise. It's decently funny to watch and the anime does a lot of really strong emotional work getting at major themes and plot devices like; what makes a family, what does love even look
                  like, the importance of not putting up masks, and friendship existing independently of romantic love. Most of the side characters have dimension and overall these middle episodes really have a strong 'slice of life' element that functions along side the romcom flavoring. In order to get into why Toradora really fails to stick the landing, we need to look at the characters and how they interact.
Our female lead Taiga is prone to violence, is effectively emancipated from her parents, and as befitting of her character design, acts like a spoiled child. 
Out male lead Ryuuji on the other hand, doesn't really have a lot of character to work with and is written as a bit of an everyman, with the only real exception being his role as homemaker for his overworked mother.
Ryuuji and Taiga make up what is probably the most interesting theme in the middle episodes; ""what makes a family"". The childishness of Taiga and the responsible nature of Ryuuji make for an interesting dynamic, akin to an older brother/ little sister or as another character points out, father /daughter.
Supporting female #1 Minori, Taiga's best friend and Ryuuji's love interest is extroverted, optimistic, driven and is the source of the theme of ""what does love look like"". At various points she questions her sexuality, compares believing in love to believing in ghosts and struggles with the idea of conflicting loves.
Supporting male #1 Yuu is Ryuuji's best friend and Taiga's love interest. Unfortunately there isn't much to say about him past that. The writers really didn't seem to know what to do with him and his characterization varies wildly, from naive to astute, from reserved to an attention seeking half dressed santa. He doesn't really drive much and is really the only member of our core cast that doesn't really shine.
Supporting female #2 Ami, is outwardly friendly, people pleasing and kind but underneath is aggressive, standoffish and scheming. Her arc runs the ""importance of not putting up masks"" theme. She struggles with people liking her outward mask and not the real her and functionally also stands in as the observer or audience surrogate, often commenting on the interpersonal relationships of the others, pointing out dangers and complexities as they develop.
*Major spoilers ahead*
Here is where the plot dun goof'd. The third act sees Taiga and Ryuuji falling for each other and ultimately ending up together and it really screws up some core themes set up and really makes some of the prior plot points and characterizations feel gross instead of interesting. Our leads antagonistic and violent but ultimately caring relationship works for siblings but is abusive and toxic in a romantic relationship. Its bad to the point of feeling like you are watching a victim of abuse telling you about how they love their abuser. It's skin crawly from a viewer perspective but even in the text, Ami points out that Taiga effectively functions as Ryuuji's child, making it a bit uneasy within the universe constructed. This decision also undermines Minori and Ami's themes as well. Both supporting female characters also find themselves falling for Ryuuji which kind of results in bad takeaways from their underlying themes. Minori, who doesn't pursue love since it isn't something she understands, is from the viewer perspective, left with a takeaway of; feelings of love result in heartbreak and Minori's unwillingness to engage with love being justified. Ami fares little better. The one guy seeing her for who she is instead of her mask is thoroughly uninterested and as such, the viewer is left with little reason why one should show their true self as opposed to keeping up their mask.
It's not easy to preserve your themes in a love triangle when each angle of that triangle caries its own moral weight, but Toradora doesn't even come close. I suppose it could be seen as a dark outlook on love but the tone of the show doesn't paint that as the case. All this is a real shame, cause while watching most of this, I really liked the emotional groundwork they were doing. Choosing your family and the danger of masks especially resonated and unfortunately all I was left with at the end was a gross slimey feeling. By the end, Ryuuji had to end up romantically involved with someone and given the options of; someone who decided to believe in love and someone who revealed their true selves to him, he decided on settling down with #3. His sister.",5
"
                Toradora is probally hands down one of my most favorite anime. It is simplay amazing. It has everything that you could hope for: Lots of comedy, an AMAZING love story, and tradegy. Its about this girl Tiaga who is a small, but very mean and feared who is a klutz but a boy named Ruyuji, who looks like a thug but is a very nice person starts to care for her and the show goes on from there. Its an amazing show that you should watch

                Toradora! may well be the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. I loved the characters, their quirks and the way they interacted. This series struck a near perfect balance between comedy, drama and romance. At all times you will be rooting for Ryuugi and Taiga.
Even if you not a fan of romcoms you should see this.

                Initially, this may seem like a simple and common romcom anime, but once you get into it you learn there is so much more to it. Two characters who you immediately think are going to be ""in love at first sight"" but not see it, is completely wrong! Two teenagers starting school, one looking like a deliquent and one being one, meet and before they even talk, they fight. The entire plot of this series just felt very individual and there is very good reason for it to be as popular as it is.
Due to this anime coming out in 2009, the art is good
                  but now we have much better styles. However, the faces of both background and foreground characters clearly individualise them and while it is easy to spot who the main cast are, the side-characters feel very lovable, even the ones that have no lines.
Both of the opening and ending themes for this song are catchy after just hearing them once. The first opening is known widely in the anime community as it is considered one of the best and it is really good at making non-Japanese speakers really struggle to sing along but try anyway.
Ami Kawashima - She understands, probably more than any of them, the deep relationship between Kawashima, Minori, Ryuuji, Taiga and herself.
Minori Kushieda (Minorin) - She has been Taiga's best friends since childhood. To show friendship, Taiga cakks her by the nickname ""Minorin"".
Ryuuji Takasu - He is a seventeen-year-old high school student in his second year. Due to his father, his ""sanpaku"" eyes make him look like a delinquent and cause a lot of  misunderstandings to occur. His father ran away when he found out his mother was pregnant, leading Ryuuji to growe up to be self-sufficient. He is very skilled at cooking and is a ""clean freak"", as well as being very skilled at sewing.
Taiga Aisaka (Palmtop-Tiger) - She is a seventeen-year-old high school student in her second year. Due to her constant outbursts, as well as her rather short height, she has been given the nickname ""Palmtop-Tiger"". She is the typical tsundere with her attitude, constant insulting and bickering and even lashing out in violence, but even with this she is adorned by her entire class - she is also the type to switch her emotions and opinions rapidly. 
Yusaku Kitamura - He is the vice-president of the student council who yearns to become the president of the student council after the current president leaves her position. He is very close childhood friends with Ryuuji.",10

                If you're looking for a short review, it's this:
I finished Toradora tears ago but overall, it's a good anime. Like what most reviews say, Toradora is cliche and has too many similar troupes with most RomCom anime as well but the execution and the development of everything are what makes Toradora a great anime. Other than those, Toradora's dialogues and OST is the cherry on the cake.
Everything fits in the end but I still dislike the female lead and still prefer the other, blue-haired heroine due to the female lead's lack of character development which is something most fans look forward to. To sum it
                  all up, I can say that Toradora deserves its place as one of the ""best"" and classic RomCom anime. The story is very good, the art is very good, the sound is outstanding, characters are great, and my enjoyment and overall score for Toradora is 9.",9
"
                I sorta lost the plot once the inevitable ""what is their relationship?"" thought seeped through the friend group and converged back on the two in question. The beginning was shameless and wholesome and lovely. Once they started adding in the emotional complications from an incongruence between desire and action, it became tiresome.
The two main characters, Aisaka and guymandude, are both incredibly moe. One is a ferocious, moody, violent girl with an uhhh... chibi body-type. And the other is a guy with resting yakuza face who loves nothing more than obsessively cleaning any domestic environment he comes across. His genki mommy also has the big tiddy.
                  This is good.
Sound is totally unmemorable.
It was decently animated with good character design, especially in the case of Aisaka and genki mommy, but I don't remember any truly standout visual phenomena.
I watched through the halfway point very quickly, then spent a month trudging through the rest.
6/10, it really amps up the emotional experience of 286769 and 315891.",6
"
                Like many other Toradora reviewers, I don't usually watch rom-com anime and started this show as a bit of a gap-filler for my train journeys rather than because I really wanted to watch it, but after a few episodes I found my expectations completely blown apart!
Toradora is a lighthearted romantic comedy but the one thing that sets it apart from similar shows is that it never gets boring. Each episode is fun and different and the further along the story gets, the more you're met with unexpected twists and turns! The final third of the show had me gripped, which is an impressive feat for
                  a show of this genre! 
The art is wonderful and still looks incredibly new, the characters are unbelievably loveable and unique and overrall I would say I have no complaints, though the ending was unexpected (but wonderful!)
I would highly recommend to any anime fan, seeing as this isn't my usual sort of thing but I still absolutely loved it.",9
"
                I allways loved this genre so I started waching it and I just loved it, the characters relationships were great and the story line was solid. It was perfect with romance and comedy and it was really intresting and I got really invested and I wanted to give the series a 10 after I saw 20 episodes. But then I saw the last 5 episodes and got mad, the episodes were'nt bad and I just love the mom in those episodes, but it felt like it can't be the end, it felt like they didnt really solve the probloms in the story and they didnt
                  gave enough background and reasons for te ending. Despite all of that I really enjoyed the anime even at the end, it was good enough to even make me mad, and I really recommend watching it.",8
"
                [Story: 8] The story that this anime contained was very similar to other animes I have watched. However, the amount of symbolism and metaphors that were included gave the story another flavor that I have missed. It was interesting to see how different the characters could be. The characters could have two different appearances based on if you have watched the anime or not. If you only seen clips, then you would assume ordinary and cliche anime characters in high school trying to survive their days of youth. However, if you have seen or finished the drama, you realize that the characters are more than
                  what they appear. They not only fight with how society sees themselves but also fight and discover their hidden true self. The journey to see them mature can be a little slow but the end result was sorta worth it. Kinda foreshadow the ending but the little hidden symbolism at the end was unexpected and added a bit more beauty to the story line. 
[Art: 7] I don't know much about art and design but I liked the art style. It was nice and fit in well with the story line. 
[Sound:7] I also don't know much about the sound. I enjoyed the ost of the anime but it didn't drag me into the anime. It wasn't as catchy as I would like, but it fit in well with the story line. The ending ost, I enjoyed how it changed and followed the story line as well. Nice touch.
[Character:8] I loved the characters. I enjoyed seeing them as society sees them and then later seeing them for who they truely are. They try to hide it from society but every so often, the episodes show a bit of themselves until we see who they truly are. And seeing them discover themselves was something beautiful to see.
[Enjoyment:6] I enjoyed the anime. However, the anime took longer than I thought to finish. Sometimes the episodes were so good I had to watch the next episodes. Other times, the story wasn't as interested and I would stop watching it for days to come. If the reel was as good as the story, I would have probably finished this sooner. 
[Overall: 7] Good anime. I would reccommend to those who enjoy school based setting and self discovery. It is a bit slow but it is worth the ride. No matter how long the ride is, aha.",7
"
                The only reason i didnt really enjoy this anime was because i expected the story to be like the manga. It was just those little differences that made it that i couldn't watch any more. If I hadnt read that manga i probable would have give this an 9 and probable would sill enjoy the manga even more so than i do now.

                A quick review for Toradora! 
As someone with an attention span shorter than taiga, I normally don't watch too many romance animes because I consistently need some sort of action or an intricate plot to keep my mind intrigued. BUT this show has done a great job of keeping my attention AND making me fawn over their relationship. 
Clean animation, a simple but interesting plot, and characters that DON'T annoy the shit out of me?? Truly the makings of a great romance anime. It was easy for me to watch, especially since I just finished Steins; Gate and am in the middle of Code Geass,
                  my mind definitely needed a little break from the ""heavier"" shows. So easy to enjoy and their relationship was completely adorable, and the show even had its funny moments.
If you are looking for a romance anime to watch, or haven't watched any romance in general, this is a great place to start!",9

                Anyone who knows me would know this show is my favorite anime of all time, and for good reason the animation amazing first of all, the story and the capturing of the characters, and there development was just phenomenal to me, I went through a lot of emotions watching this show from enjoyment, to bits of sadness, but overall a sense of joy was given with this show, from the moment i first watched this masterpiece I knew it would be one of the greatest ones I have ever see, and im glad I gave it a chance. I would recommend this show to anyone
                  looking to get inot anime, or the slice of life genre it has a very beautiful story, and captures the essence of what I believe anime is, a way of evoking certain emotions through animation, once again this show was an absolute masterpiece and one I would never forget.",10
"
                Watching the first episode to this anime, I was surprised at how good the fighting scenes in comparison to other anime. Although, this anime is not so much about fighting, but it has two great fighting scenes, and they wowed me. Not only did I love the fighting scenes, I love the romance between the two main leading roles and how it developed. I thought this anime is very touching and entertaining, and the two main characters are very lovable. This anime has all of the qualities that makes it worth watching.

                LOVED this anime. Great character development mixed with comedy and romance made this a really great anime. 1 complaint (SPOILER (kind of) but a GREAT anime and definitely worth watching. 
SO DON'T READ PAST THIS IF YOU DO NOT WANT ANY KIND OF SPOILER). (HERE IT GOES). 
LAST EPISODE: W-H-Y. The long awaited ship finally comes full into play and then they send the girl off to deal with her family problems and then bring her back for 45 seconds at the end of the show. Good for her in that regard but not good for the show. We could use a little bit of
                  cliché every once in a while in situations like these.",9
"
                I love romance. It's a wholesome thing. I don't really think the image of long term love I tend to believe works best is compatible with most media's depiction of it, but perhaps this show does a holistic form of love justice. The main characters are Taiga and Ryuji. Taiga is a tiny but feisty redheaded girl, who looks the opposite as she acts, and has a reputation for it. Ryuji is the opposite, he seems like a tough delinquent, being the son of a real one, but he's actually a soft hearted guy who likes to cook and do housework.
They both form an ""alliance"",
                  because they both have crushes on each other's best friends. I think you can see where this is going. It takes fairly long for it to reach the point where the main two characters start actually thinking they might like each other, even if others saw it from the first few episodes.
I like the ""crush"" characters. Whilst they seem kind of 2D initially you learn more and understand the reasons they act the way they act. This show is full of situations that make love difficult, that ""you just wouldn't understand"", and these crushes embody and deal with that.
There's also another side character, a blue haired girl. She's a famous model and just seems like a fake asshole initially. But she shows more depth later, seeming to know more about the main two characters than they do about themselves. She is constantly disappointed by Ryuji, and for good reason. It's not like he's being a dick or anything but his willful blindness hurts others, I'll leave it at that.
The final arc is a little jumbled in my opinion, but it has some good moments. The big twist at the end is a bit weird in my opinion, but there's an after credit scene at the end which works well and makes for a wholesome ending.
It's a really good show, much more mature than you'd expect. It's damn excellent. For a high school anime it doesn't feel like a generic high school anime. And same applies to the romantic department. It's a must watch, and is well known for good reason. A 9/10.",9
"
                Toradora! is a wonderful anime I've watched. While it may not be the best anime I still enjoyed the character dynamics overall. Ryuji and Taiga's relationship was also my favorite considering how they were both were always there for each other. Ami Kawashima is probably one of my favorite characters due to her personality (probably because I like mean women). 
The story is enjoyable but I don't like how the show becomes depressing as hell later on because I thought this would be a haha funny anime.
I would like to see a season 2 of the show or just a few shorts of what happened
                  to the main cast after season 1.
Overall, 10/10 would cry again",10
"
                Toradora! well where do i start it has a very good storyline to it, both main characters are trying to find love, overall the art is a very interesting type of art there is the comedy in the anime, i find that the comedy is very easy to understand and is another highlight of the anime! 
If you are the type to love the type of character that is forceful yet kind hearted then this anime is for you.
I enjoyed this anime because it has lots of different types of scenes that are very entertaining and they have a lot of humor in those scenes.
There
                  is those types of scenes that will play on your heart strings and make you feel connected and start to root for certain characters but all in all I rate the anime  a 9 because it has lots of good art design and it has some wonderful story lines.",9
"
                As much as I personally don't really like the romance genre in anime, I was pleasantly surprised by shows like Sing Yesterday for Me, which many people say is mediocre but I disagree, and Rent a Girlfriend, which many people have a problem with the main character and I didn't.
So when I heard that so many people really liked Toradora, I checked it out and thought it was just ok. It wasn't bad or anything, I wouldn't even say it was bland, boring or mediocre. I just didn't think it was anything special and I was personally annoyed at the presentation of certain scenes. One
                  example I can think of is with Taiga's father being a douchebag episode and how Minori was really mad at Ryuuji from the beginning. I thought that was really stupid especially considering his circumstances. I get that he ignored negative aspects of her father's character but I still felt that episode didn't work in the way it wanted to. I felt that Minori was being overtly ignorant to how Ryuuji would and does view the situation, making me dislike her during the course of the episode.
Another example of my annoyance with the presentation of events in the anime comes with Yuusaku's rebellious phase. When that was happening, I already knew it had to do with some sort of rejection on the Student Council President's part based on the scene with only the two of them in the council room. Given that information, everything that followed was too hard to believe for me. They didn't characterize Yuusaku as someone very reactive or emotionally vulnerable and as such his reaction to this situation felt invalid and overly dramatic for the sake of engaging the audience. You can argue that his surprising reaction to this situation was the point, adding layers to his character, but I personally see it as the writers inventing a problem that can be relatable to the audience through pandering and to get us to be more invested in his character and the show as whole. In addition to that, they antagonized the Council President to what I felt was an absurd degree and I got really upset when Taiga went into her classroom to fight her as i felt that was just too much and further supported my suspicion of this arc to be an additional hook into the show with it's overly dramatic presentation of events.
As far as characters go, I don't have much of an issue with the show. The only downside I would say is that they failed to make Minori an interesting, layered character, so it was hard to see why Ryuuji loved her. While I suppose it could just be a case of him loving her positive spirit that she brings with her, that's just something that I find to be a bit boring. Taiga's character surprisingly didn't really annoy me much as i felt her actions weren't too ridiculous for me to handle besides Yuusaku's arc where I felt both her and Yuusaku's characters were at their worst. I do think they did a great job of characterizing Ami as she was the most interesting character with the most interesting developments in her attitude towards Ryuuji and becoming less abrasive and pushy to the main cast.
I also didn't fully get why the ending was meant to be satisfying or cathartic. I get that Tiger went to patch things up with her mom to make things right and get the relationship she wants without it being something the mother would hate for her. Even with that, it felt like it came out of nowhere and the random decision beforehand to run away together felt really forced. It was as if they got feedback to hurry and wrap the story up so they rushed Ryuuji's and Taiga's confession of love to each other while also separating them from any conflict that would get in the way of that conclusion. Ryuuji's mother's character was also highlighted in the ending of the show which made me upset because I felt that this idea of his mom essentially being a kid with a kid was just an idea floating in the air up until this point and they only chose to fully address it at the end, robbing us of any build up and development up to this point in the show's end. When Taiga returns to the school in the last few moments, I didn't feel satisfied or emotional, I just felt disappointed.
For what I really enjoyed in the series, it can be summed up in the Beach house arc. There I felt is where every character was at their strongest and the writing itself was at its best. As much as admittedly nothing really happened during this arc, it gave greater insight into Ami who I already enjoyed as a character and Minori where they give a hint to a more interesting side of herself. The comedy was fairly enjoyable, character interactions were fun and it just felt like this is where the team behind the show were really enjoying themselves. It had me invested with a minimal amount of drama, purely through the strength of the characters.
In all, the show was enjoyable, especially Ami's relationship with Ryuuji. I think it begins ok, the middle is the really enjoyable part for me and the ending was stupid. Toradora is a frustrating show with enough enjoyable elements for the viewer to come out with a net positive experience, though I can see this show being very easy to hate. With that, it's solidly above average for me but not far above average. Hope you can enjoy the show more than I did, form your own opinion and maybe even justify some of the things I dislike.
Thanks for reading!",6

                There are titles that create new genres, but there are  titles  who close whole genres.
""Toradora"" is a very important product for ... for, probably for all of us in a part of a round and for the industry as a whole.
She puts the point in such a genre as ""School Romance"". Yes, I want to say that school romance is dead, after Toradora it makes no sense.
She takes all sorts of plot strokes, breaks them, turns inside out and with the elegance of the circus artist throws into the air. And while you are trying to see the magicism, focus, but this magic
                  is not going to turn the steriophips of the genre, but that this is a serious romantic story that you will not show you.
The most sad and beautiful in Toradora is that ... The fact is that usually the ""peak of emotions"" is the main prize for the viewer or the reader of the romantic novel, this is a prize that you deserve. Here you do not feel what they deserve it. The romantic story is very sad, first she breaks all the usual plot twists, and then leaves the viewer alone. You really believe the good ending of the series after in this series I broke all the other twists ... OOO, Toradora spoke about school romance ...
-And what did she say?
        -Who?
-Toradora.
        -What did you say?
About school romantics.
         -yes nothing... she's dead, kittens.

My favorite root
  YUUSAKU KITAMURA - SUMIRE KITAMURA
We should not have the reasons for something to love or hate, remember these kittens, otherwise you are trying to fool and manipulate you ...
Perhaps I just close to your heart, how rationalism kills affection and it literally breaks Kitamura. Perhaps I like the shift of the speakers between all the characters in this arc ...
In fact, I like the driving voice Kanou, but I did not say that.",10
"
                At the beginning of this show I actually really liked it. I liked the way the story was set up and I liked all the characters. The only thing this story really did wrong was the relationship between the main characters. Taiga's and Ryuji's love felt so rushed and forced. There wasn't enough build-up to their love. They didn't have many special moments with each other that really would've gave their relationship some much-needed depth. Also, the ending was very confusing and frustrating. That was another thing that felt very rushed. This anime had a lot of potential that was wasted. I wouldn't really recommend
                  this for anyone to watch.",5
"
                Toradora is not a incredible Anime, but even whit that, i can't ignore the fact that it got something strange that make it unique and fun.
Im going to try my best to explain why i think that this is one of the best Animes that i have ever seen, at least, until now.
The story is not very complex, pretty simple, and whit the first episodes, everything is comedy.
Trought the pass of the episodes, Toradora gets more and more complex topics onto scene, nothing special, but at least, interesting and fun.
The end is good, the characters are good, the episodes are not heavy to watch and
                  just to lose time, i think this is the perfect anime.
Give a try to Toradora, you will not regret.",10
"
                Toradora is not just a regular comedy romance anime don't fool by the cover or the silly character acts, but this story is rather relatable and touching for most of us. Let just say if you quit the anime because of Taiga being mean to Ryuji you gotta understand that relationship is a bond that can only be formed over time since taiga has been hurt it not surprised that she can't open up to everyone plus nobody really understands her in school so please understand her as a character. Toradora establishes a super-strong bond with the character and the character development is just amazing
                  You gonna have to watch the anime for the rest of the story, but this anime is super relatable we all need someone to be on our side caring for us that the role of Ryuji to Taiga and Taiga is a relatable character that gives advice and keeps Ryujji busy she isn't a useless character she is really caring of other trying hardest to help in any way. they were perfectly fit for each other as a couple but you know the story is just different making this such a special anime unlocking the doors for both characters watching this anime felt like a journey for like many years and season pass it truly awesome. aright my enjoyment is 10/10 you can't imagine how much I kinda cried and laugh my butts off during this anime, the music is legendary it always comes in perfectly making the anime sad when it needs to be, the art is ok you saw this kind of art in many different anime but the story to me was just something else I never experience please watch this anime don't even consider that age of it it still make your smile which is why I love this anime.",10
"
                warning, english is not my native language.
Many say as the main argument, it is toxic, and what does it have?
It is a story, it is necessary that the protagonist has defects and more in this animated work. 
And that she never changes, she changes, that you do not notice it or expect an unreal change overnight is your problem.
starting, she's 17 years old(the famous stage), she was abandoned by her parents, don't you think that's enough? not convinced? let's continue, they bully her about her body(and with that you understand why she was in love with kitamura, because despite the fact that everyone made fun
                  of her body, he found her attractive), they give her nicknames and they make fun of her. it is normal to be very defensive, even so some don't want to hurt him.
the story is about the path before the change, not how she changes
what doesn't change? At the beginning it was hard, already in the pool you see a noticeable change, then on vacation, what did they commit imprudently at the end? Well yes, they are young and the exaggeration cliche of these.
but I repeat the story it is not her changing, it is her accepting that she has to change, that's why a phrase from her in the final chapter, she says: I BLAMED FOR MY PARENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES FOR MY LACK OF CONFIDENCE..... I´LL CHANGE. I´LL ACCEPT WHO IAM.......THAT I CAN GIVE YOU MY LOVE. (netflix subs). despite the fact that his parents and the circumstances do have to do with his behavior, but she understands that this has no justification.
In a few words, the series was about how the world showed her that not everything was pain and abandonment, that there is someone watching over her, that's why it was obvious that she ""got away"" with it.
already closed the taiga arch, we can continue with the rest, the most unnoticed was kitamura since his problem was the least serious, then there is Ami, that she could not be who she was, it was solved, ryuiji's that was only similar to taiga's, but this one has the fortune to know mother's love (remember that her mother only appears when taiga almost dies, in short, disastrous parents)
and Minori(curiously she is the most beloved but she is the most disastrous)
she is the typical one who hides her problems, only to explode later, that is why ami tells riuji that she will end up burning, since it is seen that ami confronts minori some time later, she is the typical girlfriend or boyfriend they once had and you ask her what you have? and she answers you nothing, then she goes through other things and in the end she takes everything out on you, instead of solving everything from the beginning and strengthening the relationship.",10

                SPOILER ALERT!
Not much to say to an anime from 2008 who hasnt been already said. When I watched the first episodes I didn't like one bit, I said to myself, wtf am I watching, I trust my friend Bit though who recommend this one, and we usually have the same taste for everything, so I kept up for him, hoping that would get better and it did. The thing is, when I was reaching the 10th episode(that took me roughly 3 weeks or so), I thought '' I endured this shit until now, I can do this again'', and then, Everything changed when I reached
                  the 15th episode, as I read some of the most popular reviews, this show feels like it has multiple seasons, this one was a big changer, after that episode Taiga is not more that mongrel who is annoying af, relying on Ryuji to everything single thing and being ungrateful for the WORLD he gave to her. One thing that kept the flame alive, was the development of the both main characters, the obvious thing that would happen, both trying to help themselves get their loved ones, but ending loving each other, a cliché, sure, but a good one. And Toradora! is no different. I liked the ending but didn't love it, it was right to them end together, the marriage surprised me though, and made me excited for both of them tbh. The decision taiga made on the last episode, I didn't like one bit, but I understood though, what she meant and somehow it was good for her and for ryuji she did that. Didn't like too that they left the proper ending to the post-credit scenes, could be easily missed, after the marvel era I don't leave anything without checking those haha. Minorin was a good character, she had her flaws, didn't like how the animé showed to us the feelings she had for ryuji, it was like, yeah you can clearly see that she cares, she likes him, but lets just put this way ''it's to personal, I don't wanna talk about it ', differently from Taiga, that besides the attitude of not opening herself to him or anyone for most part of the show, as ryuji get near to confess his feelings for minorin, she realizes what she could lost, and can't bear the thought, hence, the scene of her crying in front of ther building in that snowing night, and minorin seeing the whole thing, one of the best scenes. And just let me say, what a character Ami is, the first impression is that she is a bitch, but as you get to know her, surprisingly she is a well-written character, say the things the other don't have the balls to say, and she has the mindset to things I do too, can't help but think we could be good friends. Besides all that, the show is a lotta fun, some really funny scenes, Kitamura and Ryuji's mom were both excellent side-characters, they had all stories developed during the show and evolved from them, it's not easy to make me smile during a show, and this one did with mastery. Don't take my 7 for granted, this show is amazing, and if you think about droping it off, hold a little longer, it will get good, taiga will turn a likeable character believe it or not and ryuji being a good guy as he always have been.",7

                I really want to type how I feel having recently finished toradora.
This aint the best anime I've ever seen, not even close to the top 10, or even top 15, but for some reason, it just has a place in my heart, is not a masterpiece, but you can really feel the love they putted in this show all throughout the episodes.
Also, as of right now, 10/09/2022 at 4:29 am, this story hits different, maybe in some time ill look back and say, this wasnt as good as I thought at that moment, but I really want how I feel about the anime right now
                  to be there forever.

I love toradora!.",8
"
                I hated it. For real, I've never hated a character as much as the little girl, she's incredibly generic and annoying. I don't care if I'm biased, this show was horrible. I held back at giving it a one since a few episodes were acceptable.
First, the tsundere type of female lead can be interesting when handled well. Now this girl was basically an angry chihuahua the whole time and didn't make me feel any sort of positive feelings towards her. I literally despise her okay.
Now the other dude was alright, I guess. I mean, look, I don't even remember a single thing about him, except
                  that he's tall. Now you'll ask, how do you not remember at least a few more things: that's because I fell asleep.
I slept for the first time when watching an anime, that tells a lot about how trash this was.
And yeah, I watched the entire thing...",2
"
                     This is, and mostly likely always will be my favorite tv series/movie of all time (basically just my favorite thing that I've ever watched). At first I was skeptical, I've never liked romance stories and in this one you already know from the first episode what the ending will be, even if watching KorewaEden didn't spoil some of the episodes for me.  But this is one of the best written shows that I have watched, and I plan on buying the manga and light novels once it is complete. Throughout the series not only do you get to see
                  some of the most realistic/relatable character development for the 2 main characters, but you get to see every student in class 2-C mature in their own way, leaving me loving every character and making the final class photo all the more heartbreaking. At first you see Taiga Aisaka as a stereotypical small but mean girl, and Ryuuji Takasu as a cliche ""looks mean but is really just a nice guy"". But immediately after introducing the characters, they show the other side of them, with Taiga being a shy klutz and Ryuuji being at a level of maturity and house-wifeness that no highschooler could ever achieve. It introduces the other main characters in a way that not only shows what their role in the series is, but also shows their character and what their strengths/weaknesses are, letting them slowly overcome them throughout the show. The art is fantastic, showing great attention to detail and staying very consistent, which is only assisted by the great voice acting/sound (I would highly recommend sub over dub, I've watched the series in both formats, and I was honestly pretty bored while watching the dub, and didn't like how any of the characters sounded), with Lost My Pieces being my new favorite song in anime. I am very strict on what an anime has to achieve to be a 10, it not only has to reach my emotionally, making me come to a point of tears at some parts while smiling/laughing at others, but I believe that a truly good anime can also change your outlook on life, no matter how minor it may be. This anime not only has the best character development that I've ever seen that leaves you liking every character in the series, but it also teaches multiple extremely valuable lessons. I've re-watched Toradora! multiple times now, and I can still get a lump in my throat, goosebumps, and a stupid smile throughout the series, which very few things can do on their first watch. I would highly recommend watching this series, even if you don't like romance, even if you don't like anime, this is one of the best written shows out there right now, that will leave you wanting a second season, as many people do.
Quick Spoiler, so don't read unless you've already watched the show.
     Speaking of ending, I've seen many complaints about a bland ending and it seeming rushed, but in my opinion, they ended it that way for a reason. Taiga left to go live with her mother, Ryuuji didn't come along out of respect for Taiga, and a mutual understanding. I would've loved to see her work it out with her parents, and would've been even more happy to see them get married and progress through life, but if it did that, then it would've just been another romance anime. They did that to not only reinforce all of the lessons taught in this series, but to permanently engrave this series into out minds. I can guarantee you that if they had not ended it at that point, then I wouldn't be able to write the review that I am today, because even weeks after I originally watched it, and finishing multiple other shows, I can still lie in bed and think about Toradora. I installed an emulator and Toradora Portable just to get its ending, but never played it, not because I don't want an ending, but because I still got to see a happy ending, and anything more than that would have potentially ruined the series. It is like the phrase goes, all good things must come to an end.",10
"
                Yeah, it's another teen coming age/ ""slice of life"" anime, it ahs many of the classic character stereotypes represented, and yes many of the classic tropes are represented but unlike so many others it's well done. What surprised me is how naturally the series develops. The characters are simple but not one dimensional, depth is obtained through flawed but very human choices and the consequences of them. Tropes are present but instead of being shoehorned in they exist as integral parts of the story, often notices after the fact instead of standing out like the ""fan-service"" we've come to expect (and often dread). Episodes flow
                  well, without the gaps and jumps I've grown to expect and when the end is reached it felt natural. It would be easy to go on, but in the end it's an enjoyable series that makes me interested in taking a secong look at the ""SLICE OF LIFE"" genre.",10
"
                Toradora isnt just an anime its more than that it feels like you are their with the characters like they actually live off of you watching going into crazy romatics trouble what makes toradora amazing is not just its amazing art but its character the characters feel like someone you whould meet in real life and after 25 episodes you feel like their lives just keep going on please watch toradora and see this incredibale adventure of a anime I personally loved this anime because of how  the romance genre can be pllayed so well while a lot of other series dont have that
                  amazing feeling toradora has if you want to laugh, cry, smile, be angry, watch this masterpeice of a show.",10
"
                Toradora !, is considered a classic among the genre of romance as far as anime is concerned, along with snafu first season or Clannad within those same times, however, having reached chapter 20, although I cannot say that the episodes are boring or romance makes no sense. If there is the problem that the whole plot is very accelerated and does not explain us correctly why the characters feel the way they feel, so far Taiga's attraction to Kitamura is only explained as: she began to notice him after having rejected him, the same Ami, who feels very sudden the fact that she is attracted
                  to Ryuuji. Of this class there are several examples, but it could be due to the relatively short time in which they had to develop the story and from what is seen in some spoilers everything becomes more dramatic from episode 21 to the end in episode 25.",6
"
                ~{ May contain some spoilers }~
I’ll start of with what’s good about it.
The story is well written, even though you might hear some people say that it’s too dramatic the actual writing and content of this show is never boring. Sure, some of the stories and character arcs may be predictable but predictable isn’t always bad. As long as it still makes you want to keep watching to get to that predictable ending you already know will happen. Now there’s nothing especially great about the story, it’s your average romance with a bit of comedy and all the teenagers are in love with each other
                  all over the place. But it’s well structured and it doesn’t lose the plot halfway through and it never gets too preachy.
The characters too are well developed. Taiga appears very shallow and two-tone at first, with only two defining characteristics but she does eventually become deeper. I find more fault with Takasu to be honest, he appears to only care about pleasing everyone else throughout this show. Yeah he’s got a crush but we hardly ever actually see him do anything about this. And Taiga barely helps him, it’s mostly him just doing what she wants and helping her with Kitamura. The rest of the support cast are probably better written, they actually have personality flaws and depth that have seemingly escaped our two mains.
There was a lot of content that annoyed me, but again, the show is written skilfully enough so that those things don’t detract from the actual point it’s trying to make.
The animation was fine. Nothing amazing and nothing caught my eye, it is good quality art definitely, and there’s nothing wrong or disappointing about a show having a plain, straightforward style. The character designs are better for the girls, the two main male leads are pretty much the same except one wears glasses and the rest of the male cast all look like brothers except for Haruto and Noto. 
The music was boring. I can’t remember any of the song used for both openings and endings. But the animation for the first opening was probably the best animation in the whole show. 
Now I’m going to list a lot of the stuff that annoyed me. You can stop reading here if you don’t care ^^
This is a tough anime for me to write a review about actually. It might confuse some of you. Because I do like this show, but, it also contains almost every trope I hate about romance themed animes. The score may seem low to some, but I guess I’m just hard to please in this respect and I have a habit of loving and hating the same thing for different reasons.
The worst part, is of course that all the teenagers act like it’s the end of the world when their crush doesn’t end up liking them back, or they get over it quickly and come back with 
 ~ ‘I’m not giving up on that person just because they rejected me!’ ~ 
Look, I’m all for positivity and fighting for what you want. But fighting for what you want turns into toxicity when it involves you, fighting for a person that has already expressed they have no interest in you romantically. Love isn’t about making someone love you, it’s not about changing yourself until they do and it’s definitely not about obsessing about someone until they happen to notice you. Putting this kind of plot device into anime aimed at teenagers is a bad idea, especially emotionally stunted Japanese teenagers.
It’s also unnecessary and does not make feel hopeful and fired up like it attempting to make feel. Instead it makes me lose respect for that characters personality. 
I also have a huge problem with main characters like Takasu, which again, is basically telling male teenagers they should be constantly grateful that a girl will even deign to allow them to be in her presence. That it’s cute when a girl calls you her dog and demands that you do anything she commands. The worst part is that Takasu just takes it and does what she says. 
There’s nothing wrong with having a kink for this type of genre, like Inu x Boku ss type relationships are perfectly fine, because in that show both of the MCs are willing participants. While in this show it always just seems like Takasu is along for the ride and isn’t really enjoying himself. Also it hurts the believability of his and Taigas feelings for each other. Because it’s not played of as a joke, but rather that Taiga is really like this. 
There’s also no real lead up to him developing feelings for her. There is with Taiga. I actually think that part was done well, we see her struggling with how much she cares for him throughout a lot of the show and finally accepting it.
But with Takasu we see none of that. He just keeps going on about how he left her alone again and he doesn’t want her to be sad, but there’s no depth of feeling. To me it just comes of as him feeling pity for a friend who has no family and friends to take care of her.
And… confession culture… what can I even say about this ridiculous practice? The way it’s played out in some animes is just insane. Imagine someone you’ve talked to like once in your class or school suddenly confessing they love you? I would seriously think they needed help of the psychiatric kind.
Lastly, XD, the absolute worst part of this anime, and this is the one thing that really lets it down and makes it go from an 8 to a 5 for me, is the tactic they use to fill time up. 
Every time something big happens in the show, which is always one of the characters confessing to another. It also always happens at the end of an episode, then the next episode has a time skip at the beginning. So suddenly it’s like a month later and we have to wait through another episode to find out what happened in flashbacks.
 The worst of these is of course the big confession right at the end, and the fact that the time skips are always due to someone being hospitalised or hurt. It’s just a lazy way of attempting to build suspense and also fill a few more episodes. When a show repeats the exact same plot device just using another character that’s when you know that someone in the writing room had a hangover that day and just could not be fucked. It’s basically the same as using the script from a prior episode and changing the names around… 
Anyway, sorry this is so long, I tend to over analyse everything.",6
"
                Romance anime is so hit or miss for me because they can turn sappy and unrealistic really quick, or turn slow and boring. In personal preference, I hate it when a romance anime will insert like 12-24 episodes of exposition only for the characters to hug in the end, or for the characters to hate each other and then 180 in the middle. 
Toradora approaches both of these tropes very closely, without ever crossing them, which is GENIUS. First of all, I love Ryuuji so much—his laid back, almost fatherly attitude is a perfect transition, so by the end, it's all full circle. Taiga is
                  also extremely lovable (and I really enjoyed hearing Happy's voice again haha). The side characters also get a lot of attention and love which is perfect; none of them feel like devices to carry the story forward, and you end up caring and rooting for all the characters by the end. 
I kinda wish we got to see more of the story afterward, but the ending that we're presented is enough for me to accept and love. I can easily see a great future for all the characters.",9
"
                This is a perfect anime. All the way from story to sound to art. You can really tell that this anime was made with passion.
You get a very real feeling watching this anime. Its a very real but Beautiful plot. You feel with the characters a lot too becuse they have a lot of depth. They arent just some plot device that doesnt feel like real people. And theyre lifes are far from perfect which is a little rare to see in romance animes. nearly every scene in this anime is important. This is a really hartwarming leaving you a little sad your life arent
                  like theyres.",10
"
                Story: 2.5/10
The main problem is that the plot lines are not well organized. It felt like many stories were randomly jumbled together, without one clear theme. The story is unpredictable but in a bad way, as many plot points were presented suddenly without sufficient events leading up to it. Some important plotlines were not well elaborated which is quite a shame. It didn't feel rushed, but there were many unrelated plots to the main stories. I believe that plot progression is essential to build up the main storyline, but the stories were disorganized and there wasn't really any clear progression. Besides, some things that happened
                  towards the end were quite unrealistic and unnecessary. The ending felt forced, rather unreasonable and almost unfinished, which is quite a contrast to the first few episodes. This anime is probably better off having only 13 episodes as it goes off too many tangents without having a clear theme.
Character: 5/10
The main characters all had notable but slightly unoriginal personalities. However, the story did not have much character development, only towards the final few episodes. The personalities of some characters were also not well elaborated, making their actions felt a bit unreasonable at times.
Art: 5/10
A bit simplistic as it is made in 2008, not too bad. Some scenes towards the end were quite memorable though.
Sound: 5/10
Contributed to the final few episodes as well. I didn't enjoy the theme songs though, probably due to unclear rhythm and lyrics. Could also have more background music adding to different scenes.
Enjoyment: 5/10
This is a pretty funny anime. However, the plot lines were unclear and it was boring in the middle
Overall: 4/10
Funny anime but with bad plot progression and insufficient character development. The first two and final few episodes were the only good ones, except the ending which was quite unreasonable and disappointing. Lots of missed opportunities for plot and character development.",4
"
                This would be a short review because great anime do not need any invitation to watch. 
Toradora is one of them. Characters are not that complicated. We have Ryuuji who is not so confident in his contacts with people but as we're watching the story he starts to act more friendly and social. Taiga is no different from main protagonist. She as well has the opinion of brutal and violent person. But at bottom she's tsundere to the full. People can't comprehend their true nature and that's what connected them.
What makes that romance so popular and wonderful is this little kind and cute deeds ,
                  that we can see between two of them. They aren't honest with each others feelings, but in the end all comes to happy ending.",10
"
                My friend hammered onto me for weeks to watch Toradora, everytime I told him i didn't watch that sort of anime or whatever. But eventually i gave in and started it and never looked back. This show is honestly one of the best anime overall and definitely the best in its genre. The characters are so beautifully designed and their personalities are built in the perfect time. The chemistry between Taiga and Takasu is so wonderfully written, the pair are like chalk and cheese, but go together so perfectly.
Overall, this is one of my all time favourite anime, and i urge you to watch this
                  show, even if, like me, you don't usually watch this type of show, you will fall in love with it. 
P.S. Try not to cry",9
"
                'Toradora!' was a series for me that was slightly better than the sum of its parts. Nothing was spectacular for me, and it held several clichés that brought down the overall experience for me, but by the end of the last episode I just had a bright big grin on my face.
For reference, I'm giving the overall series a 7/10, which is decent enough in my books. A 5/10 for me is the bare minimum where I can watch a series to enjoy what it really is, without mocking it for being bad in this way or another. A 10/10 is a masterpiece, where every
                  episode is packed with passion from the creators, and that passion is directly understood through my mind and my emotions. I didn't cry watching Toradora!, but I did while watching a series like 'March comes in like a lion'.
But I didn't need to cry watching 'Toradora!' As of right now I still haven't even looked up what the title actually means, or could fully comprehend the deeper themes of the series, but I know that I decently enjoyed the majority of the ride that I went on. 
Along with that, the ride (for me personally) only got better as it went along. The emotions got stronger, as you would reasonably guess from people who are getting to know each other for a long length of time. The upside to your classic high school anime is that it gives your characters real reasons to grow along each other, and I think this is one of the best examples that I've seen of that yet. The only ones that compare for me are 'Saiki K.' and 'Mob Psycho 100'.
If you enjoy a few clichés, a lot of energetic animation and comedy, and characters that, like real life, take time to fully understand and empathize with, than I'd highly recommend this series. But if you're waning on high-school drama, and can't handle characters that would be a bit harder to sympathize with if they were in the real world (girls beating up guys, unnecessary sass and back-talk throughout a lot of conversations) than you might want to look elsewhere.",7
"
                I can usually find lots of things to complain about in everything I watch, but toradora gives me very few. There is more than one person who likes the main character, but you always know who he will actually end up with so that doesn't matter as much. The girl is a tsundere, but they become friends quickly and that doesn't impose on the story too much. I'd like to say that they took too long to get together but really that's just personal preference and I don't think them getting together sooner would have much positive impact on the story, unless we were to
                  have an arc where they were already together.
One thing I do wish was different is that I wish they would have realized their feeling sooner, so that there wouldn't be as much drama or people being sad in the end.
Overall, if you like slice of life anime, or drama anime, or comedy anime, or romance anime, there is a very good chance that you will like this show.",8
"
                My 2nd best Romance anime after Quintessential Quintuplets. This is a must watch anime if you are into rom-com. I understand some viewers cannot stand the toxicity of the female tsundere MC but trust me, this anime is like fine wine, it gets better and better towards the end.
Story 9/10
Started of as a slice of life, it is very enjoyable seeing the 2 MC interacting and doing silly stuffs together. Seems like a simple anime. However towards the end, the drama is jaw dropping. It is unbelievable how the writers manage to pull of such intensity in the story. Its really more than just a
                  slice of life, the depth of the story is what makes Toradora one of the greatest romance anime of all time.
Art 10/10
Now I know the art is not top tier compare to anime nowadays but bare in mind Toradora was released in 2008. It definitely deserves 10/10 during its time of release.
Sound 9/10
One of the most iconic bgm in Toradora is ""Lost My Piece"". This particular bgm is really a tear jerker. All the OP and ED are also top tier music. When I rewatch Toradora and every time I reached the episode where the 2nd OP is used,  I know shit is going to get real (because the tone change from comedy to serious and intense drama).
Character 9/10
I really like all 5 of the main characters. Each one has a different personality which makes the anime interesting. The relationship between Ami and Taiga is also very wholesome. 
Enjoyment 10/10
I still get goosebumps after rewatching for 3 times. This anime really sets apart from other romance anime. The best thing is it has more than 20 plus episodes which is not too short and there is a conclusive ending (please watch pass the credits).
Overall 9/10
There are definitely some flaws in this anime however it is easily overlook due to how good the other aspects are. A highly recommended anime for romance lover!",9
"
                First off, I'll append a (*) after any aspect of the show which I feel is niche or specific to my tastes and may not resonate with everyone.
So, I haven't had such conflicted feelings regarding a piece of media in a long time, so to keep it simple and clean, I'll split the entire review into the aspects of it that I didn't like and then a rough character sketch of each of the characters to trace their character arcs as portrayed in the show ( since a romance IS, by definition, character driven )
1. Thing(s) I didn't like:
There isn't a LIST of things I
                  didn't like per se, it's more about the CONCEPT of the show and how it deals with the romance itself. 
Toradora adopts the 'contemporary' approach to writing romance, which is to set up a certain caste of characters, usually who are wildly different to allow for as broad of an audience to SELF-INSERT, flesh them out in the first couple of episodes, and then just let them at each other and see what happens. While this is ~okay, and honestly Toradora is a near perfect execution of this concept, it's this concept itself that I have gripes about.
On the other side of the spectrum you have something like Kare Kano, where the show explicitly tells you that THESE two are the people that we'll be focusing on, and then proceeds to do something akin to a psychoanalysis of these characters. The romance takes a back seat and is mostly used as a vehicle to further provide exposition on various aspects of the characters, and since this IS a romance, to make them grow as people due to this relationship.
So which would of the two would you prefer? I personally would pick the latter anytime of the day (*)
Since that allows for a LOT more characterisation, and I believe is something that is more suited to romance as a genre (*). This, I believe is largely because in the former, the focus of the show will devolve into the recipe---> Set up a complex web of preferences between the characters ---> Set up events which further complicate this web ---> (repeat till necessary) ---> use whatever emotionally dense justification for the final state of the 'web' that you want to settle on.
Following this recipe will usually cause either to not develop at all or cause the development to feel mechanical, and basically makes it HIGHLY dependent on how much the character appealed to you individually INITIALLY right off the bat. 
A large number of characters from Toradora fall into this trap ( but thankfully a few survive to tell the tale ) (*). For example, one of the the MC's Ryuji,  basically undergoes little to no MEANINGFUL character development at all (*)
Before you go all guerrilla on my ass about saying that, let me first try to explain what I mean by character development, the different ways in which most people perceive character development can be split up into two types:
1. Change in the way they behave with other characters.
2. Some deeper, intrinsic change in their set of beliefs and values.
For me, 1. is WEAK character development (*), and it is essentially what Ryuji undergoes throughout the story, since he doesn't change AT ALL, much less so due to Aisaka which should've been the case seeing as this IS a romance story. 
2. The characters:
Ryuji --> Pretty much as said above, interesting and nice guy, but you basically know his entire thought process after the first few episodes.
Aisaka --> I initially thought she was a privileged, obnoxious little twerp in addition to being a very cliched character archetype as well, but the show does that intentionally to subvert these expectations, though it takes its sweet time doing that. 
What I liked about the way her character was written, was that these archetypical qualities that I just described, formed the majority of the problems that she had in life, here's my description of her character arc:
She feels lonely and isolated due to her family ( this is especially elaborated upon in the final few episodes, in the meeting with her mother ) --> She resolves to leave them and live life by her own rules --> finds a friend in Kushieda --> ends up relying on her --> also relies on her parents even though she has rejected them for money --> These, take a toll on her, she feels like she should get out of this cycle of dependency, but can't --> Gives up --> Meets Ryuji --> Changes.
Kushieda --> My favourite character in the show, I like how she underwent actual, meaningful change throughout the show, coming to confront her own feelings about herself and her goals. Her final conclusion of 'focusing on whats right in front of me, to not let it slip' is beautiful, and is delivered in a much more nuanced fashion in the show, also she is one of the only characters in the show, whose expressions have been given this attention to detail, elevating a lot of scenes.
Ami --> My SECOND favourite character in the show, her change throughout the show is pretty 'normal' (*) and not too formative, but is interesting because she WAS an interesting character to begin with. Her set of circumstances and problems ( being perceived as this mature and all knowing and all having personality even though she just wants to be accepted for who she is and wants to and not have to conform to these standards that other people have set out for her ) are fairly interesting, even though they don't change radically from the start of the show, are just put forward more verbosely towards its end.
Kitamura --> Not a lot to say, very standard and straightforward character.
On a finishing note, the one thing which really stuck with me from the show, is a much more subtle idea, it was an answer to the question: ""How do two people come to love each other?""
The initial answer that the show gives is no different from what we've gotten from most other pieces of media and from our own experience ( assuming you've not been married or been in a strong relationship for longer than 6 months ) --> you like someone, for both physical reasons AND some other common ground that you share --> get to know more about each other --> BOOM!
But the answer that the show gives, when Taiga comes to the realisation that she loves Ryuji ( after the HEART TOUCHING scene in which Ryuji wears that bear costume ) ( also Kushieda is the most unlucky person ever, always being at the wrong place at the wrong time ), is.....
""You get used to having each other around so much that you can't imagine living without them, no matter how much it may go against what you tell yourself and your ideals"" (*)
That is mostly just a rational reduction of the 'true love' idea, but still, having it explicitly ( to a certain extent ) said out, is sorta cool.",7

Toradora, this took a while to finish because I started at my dads while my 
mom was giving birth. I didn't know it was 25 count though so I stopped at 8 and told myself I would start once I got home.
It took me a while to want to finish it but im glad I did. Because this anime is truly a masterpiece.
Story-8
When I saw the first 8 episodes of Toradora I thought it was some cliche story about a boy who was portrayed as a delinquent and Ms.Palm-top tiger becoming friends because both of them had crushes on the others bestfriends. They decided they
                  would help each other hook up with the others bestfriend with dumb embarrassing plans. In the end the two friends fell in love and Ryuji and Taiga made a plan to run away together and get married once Ryuji turned 18. The story is basic but adds many twist and turns.
Art-6
For this being made in 2008 the animation and character styles are really pretty and well made. The fight animation scenes are animated well even when its a simple fist fight. The animation for Kano and Taiga's fight was beautiful. This only gets a 6 because most of the character designs are basic.
Sound-7
The op's and outro music was pretty and had a nice beat. The sounds were pleasant and calming as well as the characters voices.
Characters-10
Aisaka Taiga: Taiga is small, hyper and a bit violent. She gained her nickname ""palm-top tiger"" because she was small and fast and nobody messed with her because she was rude. Taiga hates the nickname ""palm-top tiger."" The more deeper into the show the more Taiga's outer shell breaks and you see how she really is. Taiga has low self confidence and sees herself as ""weak."" Taiga turns out to be sensitive and bottles her emotions. Before Ryuji came along her house was a mess and she rarely ate because she didn't know how to cook. She moved out of her dads house because her step-mom did not like her and her mom did not care for anyone other than herself. Taiga loses her temper easily but breaks under emotional pressure.
Takasu Ryuji: Ryuji is kind, responsible, smart and timid. In Ryuji's school he was known as the ""delinquent"" because of his looks, he was born with her good for nothing dads face. Ryuji is a good cook and he helped Taiga in the beginning even when she was rude to him. Ryuji told Taiga they were like the dragon and the tiger. Since ancient times they have been on equal grounds. Before Ryuji was born his father ran away with another women while his mom was pregnant. 
Kushieda, Minori: Minori is Taiga's best friend. Minori is hard working, as she plays baseball and works many part time jobs so she never has free time. Minori was in love was Ryuji and she knew that Ryuji had feelings for her also but chose to never accept them because she also knew that Taiga was in love with Ryuji and she felt Taiga needed him more than her. Minori and Ami never got along well and got into many verbal arguments and even a fist fight. Minori is kind but can be very annoying at times.
Kawashima, Ami: Ami is a model who transfers into Ryuji and the gangs class in her second year of highschool. Ami at first seemed like a kind and caring girl and was childhood friends with Kitamura. Soon Ami reveals her true personality with Ryuji and Kitamura leave the table when they went out to eat. Leaving only her and Taiga at the table. Ami is very rude and has high self confidence and is like a bully. She made fun of Taiga's size and called her a freak. Kitamura already knew of Ami's true personality and showed Ryuji how she was really like. Ami becomes a part of there friend group quickly. She starts to be more kind and truly cares for them all even though she has a hard time showing it because she doesn't want her reputation tarnished. Ami devolps feelings for Ryuji and tried to be obvious about them to Ryuji many times but he never picked up on them.
Kitamura, Yuusaku: Kitamura is Ryuji's best friend. Kitamura is caring and silly. Taiga devolped feelings for Kitamura after she rejected him in there first year of high school. Kitamura was part of the student council, invited into the student council after he was rejected by Taiga by the president Kano. Kitamura devolpes s feelings for Kano but was crushed when he heard she was going to study abroad in America. In a speech in front of the whole school he confessed his feelings for Kano. Kitamura was rejected by Kano and Taiga got into a fist fight with Kano because of this and was suspended for two weeks.
Enjoyment-10
The story was pleasant and was perfect for the characters personalities. All the characters were written very well and all had different unique personality's. The love triangle or square was very important and most characters acted on that. Well this is a high school romance, the chemistry between all the characters was exited and brought out the drama factor quite a lot. Despite this being a high school romance it was very eventful and kept me waiting for more. The buildup was slow but it was worth it in the end. I now ship Ami and Minori now though lmao.",10
"
                Toradora! is very enjoyable and the constant transition between drama and comedy got me hooked into it. It is good and all, but I'm not really satisfied with the overall story especially the ending as it seemed to be rushed.
All of the characters are unique to each other which makes them interesting. Some of them, however, are not well written at all, but they're still enjoyable regardless.
I wouldn't say the art is perfect, but I find it better than the more modern artstyles. The animation is so great and it has a lot of life in it.
Both of the two opening songs are catchy and
                  the OSTs are so good it matches the mood of each scenes.",8
"
                Sadly, I didn't like this anime all that once. There is a lot of hype surrounding it as a romance anime but since this show, I watched a lot of better shows and I realized how little I really enjoyed this one. 
The story was super lame in my opinion. I hate romance anime that are full of misunderstandings and gaps in communication. I'm talking the kind that makes you want to scream at them on the TV screen to just spit it out. That is just not fun. 
The art was pretty normal honestly. I didn't find any of the characters good-looking and they
                  looked kind of funny even. 
The sound... the music wasn't memorable. It didn't stand out in any way. 
The characters... okay, well all the females were annoying and the male protagonist was way too naive. Nothing about their interactions felt realistic. 
Overall, I give it a 7 even though it should be a 6. I added that one point because to be fair, I binged this in two days even when it wasn't the greatest. I could have dropped it, but I didn't. So clearly something kept me watching. 
I would say... you should try this show. Everyone says it's a must-watch, and maybe you'll come to like it.",7
"
                You will probably not find any series more cliched that this one but hitting even a single cliché right is hard whereas this series quite boldly takes on as many of them as the director could in 25 episodes(excluding the extras, I think there 5 more correct me if I'm wrong), and this series handles all the clichés so elegantly that before you know it you'll be at 10th episode and then it will impossible to put it down until you've seen the palmtop tiger and the dragon together.  The characters for the most part are relatable and their decisions make sense but its
                  obvious that most of the efforts are put in the leads and that's fine because its fun just with the 2 of them. It will take you on a ride throughout the emotional spectrum which was done pretty decently. And of course you can't talk about Toradora without talking about its selling point, 'Tsundere' and I loved it here, this is the show that launched 'Tsundere' into mainstream anime but for even today this stays the most enjoyable of them all(note not the best critically). I just enjoyed this show so much that I'll spend a thousand hours praising it so I'll conclude by saying that in anime series this is one of the best romantic that you can find.",9

                ** This may be very long , there will be my summary at the bottom of the review. Please enjoy, also no spoilers will be included**
----------------------------------------------------Story-------------------------------------------------------------
**5/10 Mediocre**
The story itself tries very hard to be a coming of age love story but i feel it is slowed to a crawl because of the bad realization one of the two main characters,Taiga,  I was really drawn in at first but lost me just as quick. Ryuji is a selfless, loving and thoughtful son and friend, he is by far the best character on the show and deserves the world. Taiga to me is almost the exact
                  opposite and I believe most who watch this will see that from the beginning. She treats Ryuji like a dog and no matter what he does for her she still treats him like absolute garbage. Generally speaking i understand that this is an anime and this is a common character trope that is used very frequently but in this show it really does get tiresome. After watching my man Ryuji make Taigas every meal, be there for her as a shoulder to cry on, provide well thought out advice and show genuine care for her for it only to be returned will violence, name calling and overall horrible behavior. Watching this show really hurt me and it is supposed to be a heartfelt/ heartwarming story. Instead it makes me see what i genuinely believe to be some form of stockholms syndrome, before the end of you I even became to become angered by Ryuji himself...watching him take the punishment and never say anything in return....never tell Taiga how much she hurt him and honestly i find it heartbreaking and such a huge miss. The truth is friends don’t call you shitty nicknames, physically harm you, and demand absolute obedience from you. For me the story starts of so strong but falls flat because of the inability to show much growth on Taigas part, and the shows absolute obsession with trashing the second main character of the show. The ending does a bit to bring everything together and it helped me to give this story a better score because it actually didn't end how i expected it to end which was an extremely nice surprise. I just really wish they had done something different for the majority of the show with the two main characters. It is possible to make Taiga a strong willed and powerful girl ..without making her a total ass to those around her. Im sorry if you do not agree with this but it is just my opinion. 
_____________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------Art--------------------------------------------------------------
**6/10 Fair**
The Art and animation is on par with most other recent anime movies and shows but the truth is it is just ok. Its not good and its not bad, its just average. I enjoyed some of the side characters but there is nothing special about the art style or animation of this show.  They didn't do anything outside the box and that nets the show a fair score. 
_____________________________________________________________________________
----------------------------------------------------Sound--------------------------------------------------------
**6/10 Fair**
The soundtrack tends to almost sound like a happy go lucky video game theme song, very upbeat and happy sounding  . The opening and the ending are decent enough and easy to enjoy. Some of the soundtracks stand out such as; Ki Me Ze Fi Fu,  ( an almost old KungFu movie theme song with a strange but enjoyable edm/dub-step switch-up)Tears Of Dragon ( has great drum intro and really layers the different instruments on well and in the perfect order and timing. I Honestly cannot list all the instrument sounds in the song but i really loved it)  and Kotori No Etude ( just sounds light hearted and lovely on the ears and it was my favorite one on the soundtrack. They did well making this soundtrack perfect for a high-school slice of life /romance anime. I think the sound designers did a good job here. 
_____________________________________________________________________________
--------------------------------------------------Character------------------------------------------------------
**4/10 Decent** 
I am honestly the most conflicted on this section. I absolutely Love Ryuji , Ami ( another semi main character/ possible love interest for Ryuji) and Yusaku. These characters are made very well and all show great character progression and character building. I wont go into to much detail because these characters for me are by far the best part of the show and i dont want to spoil anything about there stories that you will learn watching. Now the reason I am conflicted is because of one character, Taiga. Taiga to me is almost irredeemable in the beginning parts of the show, the truth is...she is one of the meanest characters I have seen in an anime like this. When there are chances to show a little kindness or to make someone feel even a little bit loved she just completely drops the ball. She does make up for it through the ending arc of the story but I just feel the writers really wanted her to be this tough girl but she comes off as mean and spiteful so often that i began to wonder why Ryuji even associates with her at all, this may be a personal opinion but looking at many reviews...there are A LOT of people who agree with me. She could have started the show as a mean person and developed throughout the show in a normal and consistent way but instead her development feels so rushed in the last story arc.  Taiga is such a divisive character, i really believe she has such potential as a character but instead of making her a strong woman and a loving and compassionate friend. They made her a selfless and cold girl, I understand things have happened to her that were awful but Ryuji has had a terribly hard life and and is still caring and selfless. Why couldn't Taiga adopt more of these traits? why does she have to be so unbearable in the beginning, especially to Ryuji. Overall there are some good characters and character moments but i feel Taiga brings down the rating because of her inability to show the growth that characters should and her attempted trashing of the main character throughout the show.

** 6/10 FAIR **
At the end of the day I cannot say this is a horrible anime, It does a lot of things well and some things I think it did horrible. Truth is I did finish it and I was invested, Finishing it in only about 10 hours on a binge. This show pulled me in and die illicit a lot of emotion in me. Regardless of if i agree with the direction of the characters or not  , i have to admit i did enjoy this show for different reasons and I do not by any means think it is a bad show.

Story:5/10
Art:6/10
Sound: 6/10
Character:4/10 
Enjoyment:6/10
Overall: 5/10
Overall there are some strong points to this show but i believe the character building of one of the main characters, Taiga, really leaves a lot to be desired and it very nearly ruined the show for me. You Will find a lot of the aspects of this story cringe and you will just have to deal with it. The story is ok at best and contrived and used up at worst. The art is average, being on par with most other anime in this genre. The Sound is good and i enjoyed every track. The characters leave a lot to be desired. there are some good characters and character building but i still believe the characters fall flat because of the development of the main character Taiga and how infuriating she can actually be (in a bad way). My enjoyment of this show was fairly high considering how much i have complained about the story but there is a lot to love about this show and if you like other high-school/slice of life/romance then you will likely enjoy this but dont expect anything new or different from other anime in the genre.",5
"
                Toradora! is definitely binge worthy. However, I found it very basic and predictable. I wish there were more twists in the plot but nonetheless it was a great romantic comedy.
The art is nothing extraordinary but is simple and decent. The show is pretty funny throughout and will surely make you laugh.
The characters are pretty similar in the first and last episode so there wasn't much character development but there were minor changes.
According to me, Toradora! is overrated but if you give it a show, you will not regret it for sure. The show only got good and interesting for me at episode 16.",7
"
                Basic Boy meets girl anime. You would think that, right? Just a typical run of the mill kinda thing but you would be wrong. It is a story about deceit and various events. It both has and doesnt have typical anime tropes. It bends them and twists them around into something beautiful. Toradora! Takes your run of the mill average guy and turns him into the main character. He is not well liked and tends to be treated with disgust by most people. Ryuuji meets Taiga and suddenly his world changes in a 25 episode wonder that I strongly, STRONGLY encourage you to watch for
                  yourself. Sure, as it is in my top 5 favourite anime and I am most certainly not a proffesional reveiwer capable of telling you everything finite and perfect or imperfect with Toradora, I can't say what you may think. But at the very least. Try it. You may at times encounter bordom, But again. I STRONGLY urge you to push through.

                this review contains spoilers, be warned
after seeing all the positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot. Did I like it? yes. do I think this anime deserves all the praise it gets? no. It was predictable at every stage. the only time I actually surprised was when I realized minorin actually likes our guy. and that's it. Ami was a great character with huge potential but she didn't get any development, that goes for every single character here. did any of them get any kind of development? even the blond guy with glasses had more development than ''main'' characters. 
 the last 3
                  episodes were ridiculous except for the part where Ryuji made his mom cry and make her reconcile with her family afterwards. even I felt bad for the mom.
I like the anime but I don't think it deserves all the praise it gets.",7
"
                Most of the characters are very nice and fun. The violence is hilarious.  Unfortunately the show focuses less on expanding on the characters and more on romance and trying to teach lessons in a very cheesy way. Sometimes it feels like an episode tries to characterize a figure, but doesn't add anything that wasn't already obvious. The fact that characters act surprised even when another character acts exactly as expected shows that the show just doesn't get out of its beginning stages right up until the last two episodes. Then there's of course typical stereotypes like creepiness, glorifying characters that just act like dicks
                  all the time without any thought or effort, and obvious plottwist that you didn't expect, simply because you thought the show was better than to do them.",5
"
                Honest and complete review as a ' Slice of Life ' genre fan . Fan opinions and review. And my style of rating animus.
PLOT                  3.5/4
     The anime starts usually like an simple slice of Life romance comedy where male & female protagonist become friends to help each other in there love lives but they get interested in each  other in the end but this simple plot is rolled like an rollercoaster to reach its destined destination. But its path has surprises, comedy
                  really awesome story telling and filled with romance and friendships development.And has a really surprising and really happy ending with sad moments also.One of animes with most entertaining plot.
ELEMENTS     1/1
Just perfect combo of Slice of Life - comedy + Romance along with tearful moments of heart breaking (spoiler)
CHARACTERS  AND DEVELOPMENT                     1.5 /2
Near perfect characters each has its importance and effective role in anime means a good tsundere, Minori's fun and entertaining character in each and every part of anime and equally important rest of characters but I think there were problem in beginning with a shady character like MC and man tsundere's (i don't like Taiga much)  win become the problem for my personally.
ANIMATION  AND ART STYLES 
 0.4+ 0.3= 0.7 off 1
ENTERTAINMENT AND EMOTIONS          1.6 / 2
Really entertaining anime with awesome story telling  and  elements of romance and comedy bind perfectly and twists in the plot really make a big difference in the performance of anime and add variations of elements in the series which makes it one of the best best slice of life shit where these schoolers fight there school and love life problems . And the well direction and awesome scene where the gang conform feelings of protagonists make anime appear in list of top tier animes.
I was cheering for other girls not for Taiga provided me you know ""Deafeated Feeling"".

"
                I watched this anime way back in middle school (5 years ago) so take this review with a grain of salt. 
The anime has a great start and honestly the characters are the best part they're all really easy to follow and none of them feel boring/bland.  When watching this it had my full attention the whole time and as soon as i started i finished right away. The only thing that stopped me from giving the story a ten was just the ending. It wasn't bad but it just didn't feel right but other than that this is one of my go to
                  recommendations when people ask for something to watch.",9
"
                Story
You have a general idea how the series would end, but in this case it is more about the journey than the destination. Toradora does borrow from other rom coms, but improves slightly upon the general formula. There are small details than allow it to surpass the norm. The pacing is at a decent past at first, but the final episodes can be a little slow. There is a brief slough, but the anime finishes off strong. Some episodes feel uncessary and this series would be better if it was more focused and concise. There were heartwarming as well as some hilarious moments. 
Art
Art and
                  animation is good, but nothing overly spectular. 
Sound
Great opening and ending themes. Backround music is good too, but nothing insanely memorable or recognizable. 
Character
The strongest part of this series is the chracters. Taiga and Ryuji might seem like generic rom com leads at first but there is enough nuance in their backstories that explains their behavior. Taiga is not a generic tsundere as I believed at first and Ryuji is a far cry from dense rom com male leads. other than the 2 leads, Ami also stood out as a breakout chracter in the show as she shows the most development throughout the series. Minori and Kitamura are okay, but it seems their presence in the show is to simply add more depth to the Taiga/Ryuji stpryline. The supporting cast is great as well.
Enjoyment
Going into the series, I expected Taiga to be a generic tsundere, but that simply was not the case. Her backstory gives her more depth than I initially expected. I enjoyed the humor and the drama, but some storylines seemed streched out a bit too much especially towards the end. I think the series would be better if it was a bit more concise. I enjoyed the chracter dynamics especially Ryuji/Taiga, Ryuji/Ami, Ami/Taiga, Ryuji/Mom. I found myself a little uncomfortable with the parrot character.
Overall
Toradora is defintiely above average when it comes to rom-coms. I enjoyed the characters very much, but the story starts to drag a little towards the end. The finale was fantastic as well. I would recommend this series",7
"
                In a nutshell, Toradora is about a group of good people wanting the best for each other, specifically in finding love, but ""no good deed goes unpunished"", so things get complicated. There are lots of heart-warming and relatable moments, and you'd be surprised how much depth the story has, especially when it starts to unpack family issues. Some of that stuff really hit close to home for me.
The music is also quite amazing (10 Sound), and there is an epic fight scene and other creative moments and welcome appearance changes for the characters (9 Art), as well as some real quote gems sprinkled throughout the
                  show!:
""Adoration never leads to a balanced relationship.""
""When you trip while running in the hall, you get a nose bleed. When you trip in life, you cry.""
But, of course, it is an 8/10 overall for me, end of the day, even though Episode 24 is definitely going down as one of my favorite anime episodes of all time. I enjoyed Toradora, but I'm okay with it being my little treasure, but I can't go around saying it's a must-watch because the second half of the anime did drag a bit, and the ending was good, but let's just say it gave me the feeling that a woman wrote this story, and I looked it up afterwards and it's true. 
Like a woman, this anime does enjoy leaving hints sometimes when it really should be a bit more direct, especially when it came to developing its side characters. We never really got a Minori episode, for example. Sometimes we got a little too much of drama when we really needed progress and closure, but I guess that tactic sold more episodes in the end (7/10 for Story and Character). This problem could also be exclusive to the anime, and manga/novels might be better. 
But, that said, good show, you'll probably like it. If you're interested, do it. If not, you don't have to.",8
"
                I love this show. From the start it came off as a regular slice-of-life/romance/comedy. But as this series progresses and you look back. You realize that everything at the start was just a set up for the development and conclusion to the end. And while this is how all shows operate, in and outside of anime. The level of which it is done in Toradora is on a higher level. Especially for the genre of anime it is, at least in my opinion. 
Firstly, I will like to speak on the comedy. This show is hilarious. Personally, whenever i watch something alone, like i did
                  with this series. I usually don't laugh aloud or have any other verbal reaction. Even if its a comedy special. I typically keep it all inside. Only verbally reacting to something with a laugh or gasp if i am watching tin with someone or a group (same with drinking. Alone i will not drink but socially i will!)This was an exception though. And one of the few series that can get me to laugh aloud while viewing it alone.
Secondly, the character growth. Early on in the show each character has a trait or relationship shown off in a small scene or two. To add more depth to who they are. But these relationships and traits always resurface through the show. From Kawashima's bad attitude and stuck up ways being fleshed out and explained. And still showcased even after her ""character arc"" conclude. Just in a more caring way to show how she has changed. Or something less serous like Takasu cleaning habits. And how throughout the show he fiends over messes. Which provided a few hilarious moments. Nothing that happens feels forced. And nothing shown at anytime is useless. Each character grows but also has a sense of originality for how they act and their personalty traits. Which i appreciate a ton. No one completely changes to be something new after a arc. But they grow within their shell. Showing that why they have changed they are still who they are since the start. 
Overall this show is just great. The story feels real. The characters are relatable and easy to like. Its a funny series that can hit you in the gut with a bomb of emotions. This isn't something you will regret watching. And it is one of the best of its genres i have ever seen. I am feeling a solid, 9 on this anime. I can't really complain about anytuhing and only sing its praises.",9
"
                By far my favorite anime, Its title is what caught my attention but it was the story line that made it stick. It has relatable characters that make you get emotionally attached to them. 
Its genre wasn't normally by type but it easily makes up for it in terms of Comedy, Romance, and Drama. The ending is obvious from the synopsis of the anime but the content keeps you there despite the knowledge of it's completion.
The voice acting is great especially with Rie Kugimiya the queen of Tsundere playing the role of the female protagonist. The sound along with the acting is great and enjoyable
                  along with the songs played through the show. Every episode i watched through from theme to closing song loving every minute in it. This was probably the most i have ever enjoyed an anime since i watched the classics as a child.",10
"
                I really enjoyed this series. It's a little strange in comparison to a western audience as I think we're more forward with expressing feelings, but there's something distinctly anime to someone who harbours deep feelings of love for someone and can't bring themselves to express them. 
The first thing I will give a great deal of credit for is the fact the story actually deals with a less-than-perfect setting, in which each of the characters have their own pathos and problems, and they're more rounded characters because of that fact. This is particularly why I loved Taiga, because she's a self-determined female character, but also
                  because she is just complex, difficult, has problems, and is trying to deal with them. 
Ryuuji is less complex, and I think less well-rounded, and the peripheral characters that hang around him kinda had too much emphasis. I accentuate this point because in the final few episodes, the story was pretty much dangling precariously over the cliff of ""are they going to express their feelings to eachother"", and as a result, the last few episodes seemed pretty heavily stretched. 
Nevertheless I LOVED the story and the conclusion, it was just great. This series just flew by, and now I'm kinda sad that it's over, but also glad I watched it and it ended it when it did - I think an unnecessary addendum to restate things would have undermined the rest of the series. Nice touch.",9
"
                Toradora is one of the few high school love anime that anyone can watch. It has one of the beat casts of characters in any anime ever created and the way they interact feels so normal compared to other anime. The only place where the show lacks is in the first 4 episodes. You slowly being to understand the story and whats going on, then episode 5 comes and throws basically everything you learned out the window. This isn't a bad thing, I just feel like the show could of started on episode 5 and I would of known just as much as I did
                  before. 
That being said, once you get past the first four mediocre episodes, then your in for one of the best rides of your anime life. 
I won't say anything else due to it being near impossible to spoil a lot of main plot points, but you should definitely check this show out.",9
"
                Toradora is a romcom slice of life. Keep it in mind, so the general anime is about everyday life of a couple highscool guys.. right? 
PARTLY.
The Story involves around the so called Delinquent Takasu, whos nothing of a delinquent just looks scary. The Palmtop Tiger, Taiga, who is really are a stiff lil loli/doll like student. There is also Ami, Minori, and Kitamura. And now let the love triangle begin.. So, Takasu likes Minori, Taiga likes Kitamura, Ami likes Takasu, and eventually Minori starts to like Takasu too. ...

                  to help the other's love life.. but end up loving each other.. They overcome the problems together and enjoy true love.
Art is great, it looks pleasant to the eye and no problems with the animations too. Great and a well done job.
Sound is in the same boat.
Characters. Now, hence its a slice of life, you can get to see behind every character, see they everyday life n struggle, and understand them. They are well written, and ofcourse they have some stereotipical features, for exaplme the so called not understanded delinquent, the Student Council president whos allways good, the ever nergetic i do everything i can character, but they are well developed in the anime wich is a great point.
The Enjoyment is 10. there was no problem with the anime whatso ever, personally the end was a bit weak compared to the whole built up, but thats just my opinion. I recommend this anime to every Weeb. A Great addition to the list for anyone. Take it from me, i know over almost 400 animes.",8

                This show should have received a 9 out of 10. From episode one until around episode eleven the show is a wonderful breath of air, and enticing themes. ""Toradora!"" was amazing to imagine the ways it would play out, seeing the threads and how they're meant to cross. but that wasn't ""Toradora!."" As it turns out ""Toradora!"" was a generic bland run of the mil rom-com will they won't they story that managed to squash all intrigue almost instantly. Until episode eleven this story hints at deeper personal growth and hints towards a bitter sweet resolution, the kind of story rarely told. but from episode
                  eleven onward ""Toradora!"" becomes trash, the same shit you've seen a thousand times. The story punishes you for paying attention to it, and abruptly and needlessly changes for the worse. The ""Toradora!"" offered by the beginning, is murdered by the ending and the show suffers for it. If you like generic bullshit then it's fine, but if you saw the first episode or so and thought of the interesting themes, and possible plot, skip it.",6

                I was so engrossed in this anime. It was really great until the end. The characters were fun and different, and I loved the way the romances blossomed, but.... the way it ended will haunt me... Please tell me the manga has more story, I need to know what happens to them.
Over all even my fiance was able to get into this, but he was yelling at the TV after the last episode. Really need to know where to find how things ended for the characters. Please feel free to send info.
It took us two days to get through this, but when it was over
                  we were seriously left mouths agape, heartbroken at the lack of final answers.  It is a beautifully done anime, with an amazing story, definitely worth a watch.",9
"
                Toradora is a classic, When a friend recommended it to me, I began to watch it without much expectation. At the end of the day, I only saw cliched characters and basic criticisms to think, but then in some moment, I started to enjoy it, I'm not lying when I say that it was like 5 or 6 episodes to captivate my interest. The development started to have a big improvement suddenly and it was no longer just comedy or romance, it was a drama and very captivating.The conflicts were carried out in an excellent way, and although I must say that I did not
                  like the ending, it is still good, perhaps forced and unjustified, but good. So yes, I recommend it, it's a good story, excellent characters, captivating background and it's a relatively short story, maybe that's a bigger problem, more episodes should have been made to make a better ending.",8
"
                Toradora! is an anime that knows its genre well to the point where I could say ""genre-defining""; but because of my limited scope of anime like this, I wouldn't go as far just yet.
The story is a 9/10. It is a well-written narrative that dives into character dramas and how each relationship between the characters intermingle as they traverse throughout the plot. It is neither a complex nor convoluted story that explores deep themes, as you would from other genres, but it isn't that watered-down either. There are a lot of moments where certain plot elements will catch you off guard as you genuinely have
                  fun for a good amount of episodes, only to be struck by a sudden turn of events; and I personally consider that as a positive thing. The writing that they give you is somewhat typical of a high school-based Romance and Slice of Life Drama, no matter how you would like to look at it. You just have to enjoy it as you go. By the end, as much as you could crave for more, you would be left with a satisfying close to a fun ride.  
Character: 8/10
Toradora! meticulously introduces certain details about the character's quirks and personality right from their introduction. You get to know that Ryuji Takasu is an obsessive but preserved guy who likes to keep his surroundings clean and in-order; you see that all throughout the series. Just as well as Taiga Aisaka, whose brash personality is contrasted by her meek shyness towards her crush is a consistent character trait. Every character that is introduced in the series is like that, even the side-characters have (somewhat) unique personalities. But don't worry, the story doesn't go out of its way to suddenly give you the whole backstory of a side-character that would only be useful for a couple of minutes in the over-arching plot - none of that! You would eventually see those B-characters grow as you watch episode per episode. While it does somewhat shock you for a few details you didn't know about them, it certainly knows what to show and where to focus on.
Art: 7/10
This anime came out of 2008! By all means, it isn't as stunningly beautiful as Kimi no Na Wa or as edgy as Devilman Crybaby, but it is an art style that speaks of its time. The closest you can compare the art style to is Code Geass, as it came out relatively at the same time. If you like the High School aspect of the first season of that show, or any show that came out of that year, Toradora! is not that bad.
Sound: 6/10
The soundtrack of this anime is rarely highlighted but that isn't necessarily the crux of it. You definitely have appropriate sounds at times where the story progression demands it, and it knows how to indicate moments of youthful glee and light-hearted fun. It isn't supposed to be a grand aspect of the show but it suffices, to say the least. At the end of the day, you'd still get caught up by what's happening as is then what's playing in the background.
Enjoyment: 10/10
There is no episode where it is insufferably stale or boring. Every episode finds its way to be very entertaining, purely by its colorful cast of characters, and heart-tugging story. You will enjoy this series on a binge or at different paces, either way. If you didn't get a laugh at least one episode, sue me.
Overall: 8/10
Lastly, it is no anime that wastes your time. You will enjoy it from beginning to end. The one thing that I'd noticed from watching it is when the story progresses, it certainly feels like you're in high school again. I may sound like Yuri-sensei when I say that but it personally takes me back to those days. The ending is quite possibly the only debatable topic on the entire series, so, here's my take:
I think the ending is good. It succeeds in wrapping up the story as a whole and there's nothing else you'd want in an anime ending. Yes, the sudden departure of Aisaka - literally at the tail-end of the series - was surprising but it was for a reason that you can accept just as Ryuji did. She came back to say hello to their classmates, didn't she? She even became a legend apparently. While I didn't agree on their decision to elope so suddenly and the way they did it was too much for me to bear, it was immediately superseded by a conclusive answer that actually makes you think back into the rest of the series. Take for example the exchange of Ryuji and Yasuko, I was stunned(!) by how he snapped at his own mother like that - calling her uneducated and then blaming her for being the way they are. Those were uncomfortable moments to witness but it had to be done. He needed to say those words and as parents and children, they had to go through that phase. Wouldn't you know it, they did. For Aisaka, her own dynamic with her parents happened off-screen for most of it. I wished they had shown us how it specifically transpired but it just further justifies why she left Oishan high school - to rekindle her relationship with her parents (or at least her mother). Overall, I loved the ending! It's satisfying and it's complete as it is. Do I want a sequel to it? Well, I wouldn't really mind if they did release one after 12 years! Ryuji and Taiga are a cute couple that was destined for each other the first time they met and it surely was worth the wait.
Goodness! That was my first comprehensive review of an anime that I REALLYY loved! Would you believe me when I say that it took me 9 years to finish this? I watched the first TWO episodes of the series back in 2011. I just decided to finish it now in 2020 because why the hell not? When in Quarantine, binge - I suppose. I tell you, man, this anime is worth the wait. Both in its own story and mine. Give it a try!",8
"
                Listen, I saw a girl with a sword and was expecting some action-themed anime. Little did I know I was about to become fully invested in a high school romcom. 
This show handles all its characters well. Each one is multi-dimensional with dynamic character arches. Serious themes are put forth gracefully with some humor and exaggeration for comic relief. Dramatizations are used to slightly mock itself so as to remind you not to take it too seriously. But I did. I cried several times anyway. I know it's from a decade ago, but I definitely recommend this if you haven't seen it. Can't wait to
                  read the manga.",9

                • The plot •
And you know what? I'm outraged. No, seriously. I RESENT THE GENERAL LACK OF UNDERSTANDING!!! And it's not about the overrated, we'll talk about that later, it's about... IT'S ABOUT GENRE. It's not a romcom, there's nothing about rom, it's a drama with comedy elements, but not a romcom. Such stories live, breathe, exist just for the romance, the characters' feelings of love for each other, the intrigue and stuff like that, in Toradora!... there's no such thing, it's a totally different story, about overcoming, difficulties and eternal misunderstandings, about the heroes' struggle with themselves, in short, drama. And yes, you can
                  say: ""You are not right! That is a classical romance!"" — but I don't care, chop and croak as you wish. Why do I think it's overrated? It's just that, in all the senses I've singled out for myself and in which it shows itself, weakly, not to the point, there are better examples, so I don't see any epochalism or classics here, especially when it's listed as a genre classic, which I don't even see here. That's why it's overrated.
• The characters •
Protagonist. Taiga. Example. How. NOT. TO. DO. TSUNDERE! That's it.
Ryuji. A normal male protagonist, I wouldn't call him Kyon, but the guy is no fool and at least behaves naturally, and his background is not another ""poor boy"", thanks to that.
Kawashima. Asakura 2.0 with the protagonist-killing module cut out.
Kushieda. Just a pity. Sincerely a pity. How I understand her...
Kitamura. At first, I thought he was the local ""best friend/classmate retard"", but no, the guy had a couple of dramatic moments too, overall okay man
• The artwork •
What's there to say? J. C. Staff, the whole thing, the artwork's great, there's a ton of Toradora memes. I can't really pick on anything, the first openning is totally memeish, I can even call it legendary, but the three endings and the second openning, yea, horrible, I don't mean horrible in the sense that it's Golden Time level, but I won't praise it either
• Overall •
Overall, I'm satisfied, the experience is good, I like that the story (anime, for the ranobe I have no idea) is complete and will not feel like in Spice and Wolf, when you want more and more. I can't recommend it too much, but I can give it to someone just for fun, and that's it, friends.",7
