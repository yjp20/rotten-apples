                “It’s not about whether I can, I have to do it!” – Megumi Fushiguro...and also me steeling myself to post a critical review on this beloved anime. 
Jujutsu Kaisen is the latest shounen to gain a surge of popularity and get invited to join the mainstream table of the true anime titans, probably taking a seat right next to Demon Slayer. And I can say with certainty that this is primarily because of Studio Mappa's admirable dedication to making this show, particularly the fight scenes, look breathtakingly good. But here's the age old question: Does fantastic animation trump average writing?
Yeah, no. Heh, sorry to be
                  blunt. I guess I'm taking a lesson out of protagonist Itadori's book. But who's to say that Jujutsu doesn't have a bit of both?  While I find there to be several glaring issues with the anime, it also has many great aspects. So therefore, I'm gonna do things a little differently. This review will go over 5 areas that I believe the anime handled poorly, represented as 5 of  Sukuna's, the king of curses himself, cursed fingers. And then 5 departments that were a triumphant success in my eyes, represented as 5 of Sukuna's fingers that were eaten by Itadori...which probably gave him some digestion issues, poor guy. I mean, eating a centuries old finger? Bleh. Probably no nutrients left in those old things. 
Ah, so you're wondering why I'm going with 10 fingers when Sukuna has 20 overall? Heh. The sheer power of representing ALL of his fingers would embed this review with massive cursed energy that even I couldn't control- Ok, fine, it's actually because I couldn't think of 10 more things and it would make this review drag on anyway. There. Happy? Alright, let's get into it!
Sukuna's cursed finger 1: Comedy 
I figured I'd get this out of the way since its the most subjective flaw on the list. Comedy comes in all shapes and forms, so everyone has their own preference...the comedy in Jujutsu Kaisen wasn't my preference. Ok, so I'm not that hard to please in this department. I'm mean, I laugh at boob jokes and panty shots, that should tell you what kind of person I am. Yet shounen always seem to fail for me when it comes to the humor. I mean for one, it's generally out of place. This anime tries to be serious and has a lot of dark moments, but then immediately follows with characters making stupid faces at each other and saying dumb things. The timing is just consistently terrible. And what the heck were those after credits scenes? I dunno, I just found them to be very...odd. 
The comedy can basically be boiled down to a character acting either overly idiotic or incredibly loud/annoying during random moments. And they try to do this for EVERY character, even for the villains who, you know, have slaughtered hundreds, potentially thousands. It just doesn't work, and I don't find the show or characters funny at all, with the exception of the Kyoto School students (thank goodness for them) and some of Gojou's little quips. 
Sukuna's consumed finger 1: Action 
This one is quite obvious to anyone with eyes, but I definitely have to bring up the epic fight sequences as the first positive. They're the highlight of the show, and the focal point of numerous episodes. Because curses come in all shapes and sizes, plus each Jujutsu sorcerer has their own diverse abilities, each and every fight was unique in how the characters did battle. I thought things really picked up in intrigue and intensity when Itadori and the ideal businessman Nanami took on the villainous and childish antagonist Mahito. It was a well animated fight with a lot of interesting tactics. And then the show just had to go and outdo itself with the Sister School arc. There were a lot of great combat sequences on display, culminating in the Itadori and Toudou vs. Hanami fight, which was my personal favorite. Just some great action all around. 
Sukuna's cursed finger 2: Main characters 
Oh boy, this is probably what held Jujutsu Kaisen back the most. The trio of Itadori, Megumi, and Nobara are just...bad. I'm not a fan of any of them. Itadori is your typical dense protagonist guy who's constantly used for comedy, but you already know how I feel about that. His beliefs are interesting, but I'll get into those later. Several characters appropriately call him Sukuna's vessel, because that dude is a much more fun and interesting character than Itadori. And when it's necessary for Itadori to develop in order to progress the narrative, the show just conveniently gives him a ridiculously brief revelation or a sentence long pep talk from someone else and boom, he gets stronger and stuff. Absolutely atrocious. And his two best buddies don't even act like characters. They're terribly inconsistent. They supposedly have a bond with Itadori yet show no emotion when he comes back from a certain DEADly event. When situations get serious and death is involved, Nobara just acts entirely obnoxious and Megumi reacts to practically nothing. It's like they were trying to make him one of those cool, stoic characters but made him so cold that he's turned into ice with how frosty and nonexistent his personality is. They're painstakingly poorly written.
Gojou is also considered to be a main character, but I don't really see him as one. If he counts, then he's definitely my favorite of the four. Despite not being a fan of how absolutely overpowered he is, I enjoy his laid back yet caring nature and think that he's a solid addition to the show. 
Sukuna's consumed finger 2: Supporting cast 
On the flip side, I really appreciate how the side characters were written. Sukuna himself has a great setup with how he's actually a part of Itadori. The obnoxious and condescending tone that he takes with the kid is pretty fun, and for me this guy is the most intriguing of the characters. And I mentioned it before, but wow, the Kyoto School students are a lot more entertaining than the ones from Tokyo. With the exception of Panda of course. Panda should have been the main character because he's a panda, yet not a panda. I like his backstory and intelligence. That is all for Panda. But I really liked Miwa and thought she was fun (should've replaced Nobara as main girl honestly...) and the over the top nature of Mechamaru and his backstory is just such a joke, I love it. Every morning he breaks his legs, and every afternoon, he breaks his arms. The other two girls in the group are interesting as well. 
And then there's Toudou. He's probably my favorite character outside of Sukuna and his comedic value was actually...funny! I liked his dynamic with Itadori and his over the top nature was surprisingly a big success and didn't rub me the wrong way like I thought it would. Nice support cast Juju! 
Sukuna's cursed finger 3: Motivations 
A boy fights...for ""the right death."" Straight from the synopsis. 
Am I the only one who thinks that sentence sounds stupid and wishes Itadori's ideals were, at the very least, worded differently? Yes? No? Ok...
While his motivation certainty is unique, I'm just not a fan of how Itadori's whole shtick is portrayed. I mean, I get it, he doesn't want people to die to curses and instead to pass away content and satisfied with life, and that's pretty cool. But the way he expresses his wish feels strange sometimes with how overly macabre it can be and doesn't sit right with me. This is probably just me, but his goals made his character feel a a little off, I dunno. Also, the villain curses have pretty bad motivations. I mean, they're all like ""we're the true people because we have true emotions unlike humans!""...yet these curses are constantly shown to have wavering and changing feelings. Doesn't work. It all comes down to the themes demonstrated by the show in the end, and I feel like they could have been expressed better. 
Sukuna's consumed finger 3: Dark content 
I love how this anime isn't afraid to get violent and grotesque. Yes, some of the curses look creepy, but I'm mostly referring to what they do over how they look. The show doesn't hide the fact that death is synonymous with curses in this universe, and there are plenty of on screen killings. Even main characters aren't safe from this anime's clutches! Things got the darkest during the arc with Junpei and Mahito. Let's just say I was not expecting what happened to Junpei to go down, or I was at least anticipating some sort of reversal of his fate. But wow, there really is a ton of horrifying (maybe a bit too strong of a word, but I digress) content in the anime, and I believe it definitely works in the show's favor.
Sukuna's cursed finger 4: Power scaling 
This is more of a smaller issue that I had with the anime, but I absolutely despised the power system on display and how it was handled. Shounen shows just love to have this kind of mechanic, and it's usually used primarily to show the protagonist getting stronger and moving through the ranks. Some, like HunterXHunter, utilize this effectively. But it's just so bizarre here. The ranking of both curses and Jujutsu sorcerers is poorly conceived and made absolutely irrelevant when you have guys like Gojou who can practically destroy the world if he feels like it. There's just not that much explanation behind how it all works. And it's especially negligible when Itadori can basically power up and advance to the next level just by getting a sentence long pep talk, like he does with Toudou. Kinda silly honestly.
Sukuna's consumed finger 4: Audiovisuals 
I've already mentioned this briefly in other sections, but the show looks hella good. Great artistic quality with a lot of diverse and inventive designs. Equally important is the animation. Character movement is fluid and doesn't look that awkward at all. Also, the soundtrack is solid. Several pieces help to enhance scenes by pumping you up during fights or making you unnerved during more horror based moments. The theme songs are pretty hype as well. All in all, Jujutsu Kaisen boasts some great technical aspects. 
Sukuna's cursed finger 5: Plot progression 
My final issue listed in this review focuses on the narrative. I'm sorry, but the plot can basically be boiled down to ""Righteous protagonist has unlimited potential and he gets stronger with his friends as they beat up bad guys."" It's terribly generic and if you really focus on it, the story doesn't offer anything particularly great. There are several parts of it that are just plain sloppy, like shoving in literally everyone's backstory during the Sister School event instead of properly spacing out such scenes. While it ultimately isn't bad, the plot really didn't take any risks or try something new, with the exception of having Sukuna, who I assume will be the final boss, live inside of Itadori. That's pretty cool, but next to nothing was done with it in the second half of the show. In the end, the writing and unfortunately standard progression ended up being the most mediocre part of the anime.
Sukuna's consumed finger 5: Entertainment 
What can I say, it was a fun experience. Despite lacking in several key departments, the show itself can be pretty entertaining. Whether it be the action, character interactions, comedic scenes, or more, Jujutsu Kaisen brings a lot to the table that a wide variety of people can enjoy, so I respect the show for that. If nothing else, it can be an enjoyable viewing experience if you don't go into it with high expectations. In the end, it just wasn't for me.",6,HellLyter

                After the ridiculous success of Demon Slayer, the shounen industry is finally taking notes on how to make a successful adaption. There's so many things that can be said about JJK, that I'm confused where to start from.
Let me start by giving JJK's staff the appreciation they deserve. Being a huge AoT fan, I'm honestly a little bit salty. I'm not undermining AoT, it's just that my eyes have been spoiled from seeing a sakuga on every damn episode of JJK. It's honestly just so good.
So yes, I'm gonna first highlight the sector which totally carries JJK, the animation. JJK is a feast for your
                  eyes. The animation is just so magnificent, starting from the beautiful landscapes to the sakuga on even the smallest fights. The fights are so well choreographed, the camera angles, the key frames. I don't have enough words to explain the greatness of the animation. You have to witness it for yourself. Just like how Demon Slayers impeccable animation by Ufotable carried it, in the same way JJK's animation by MAPPA definitely elevates the anime to another level. And without the elegant animation, I don't think JJK would be at where it's at right now. So MAPPA definitely needs credit where it's due, this is how you do a first season of an anime.
One other great thing about JJK is it's power system. If you're like me who absolutely loves a great power system, then you'll also fall in love with JJK's power system. JJK has a very concrete power system, which is cursed energy. Cursed energy kind of replicates Chakra from Naruto. Both needs a good amount of focus and training to achieve them. The only difference is that in Naruto, Chakra exists in all beings. However, in JJK, not everyone had cursed energy, like Maki, they use cursed tools instead which is also an interesting concept. The reason I love the power system is that it is not too complex neither is it too simple like, eat hair = I'm strong now. Yuuji imbues his hands with cursed energy, Nobara uses hammer and nails, Fushigoro summons cursed beasts, and Gojou can manipulate space at an atomic level. There's literally an old man who uses an electric guitar to fight, I fucking love this! This power system and the character's powers, all of them makes the anime even more amazing for me.
The characters are probably the second greatest part of the anime. Yuuji is such a good shounen protagonist, he isn't annoying and doesn't scream all the time, is quite care free. On the other hand, the other members of the MC trio are just so fun to watch, Fushigoro and Nobara both. I'd be lying if I said that it didn't remind me of Naruto a little bit. The fun little rivalry between Yuuji and Fushigoro, just like Naruto and Sasuke, except better. And isn't it a breath of fresh air, finally having a female MC that isn't annoying and absolutely useless. In episode 23, when Nobara was suddenly getting sucked into a gate, instead of screaming and crying for help, she just showed Fushigoro a thumbs up, saying that she'll be fine, like the badass she is! God I love the characters.
The character goals are really interesting, which also makes the characters, interesting. Yuuji isn't like other shounen nice guys who refuse to kill people like Deku, he has an actual reason to do that. He highly commends ""the value of life"". He also does good deeds because he wants to die peacefully and be remembered as a good person, quite a simple but respectable goal. Fushigoro is probably my second favourite character in JJK. He is very secretive and stoic, all while caring for his friends. In episode 23, we got to see a different side of him, and honestly he has so much depth to him.  I normally hate female delinquent characters so much, I can't stand them as much as I can't stand Tsunderes. I hate how they go ""Kimochi warui"" after everything. But Nobara is different. She is very talkative during battles, verbally destroying the shit outta the opponent, all while being badass as fuck during all times. She also deeply cares about his friends, she is a great character. Not only this, but side characters like Panda, Maki, Inumaki. Every- again LITERALLY EVERY CHARACTER in this anime is so fucking good and interesting, even the antagonists like Sukuna and Mahito have a considerable amount of depth to them which everyone can comprehend, which makes them so good.
Let me tell you this, an entire paragraph isn't enough to explain how amazing and interesting the characters are.
The only part JJK is a bit lacking in is story. Since it's only season 1 and the story hasn't expanded much, but even still, the story is a bit generic. It feels like a typical monster of the week kind of story. Even the story is a bit average now, all other aspects carry this anime. And yes, the story switches tones really quick, it goes from a dark and gritty tone to a light hearted tone pretty fast. And the best part is that they perfectly execute it.
No one said that an anime must excel at all aspects. There was no boring moment in the entire anime, despite the story being typical, I always thoroughly enjoyed it.
The Juju Strolls are a perfect addition after the end of every episode, no matter how tense an episode is, the Juju Strolls are entertaining to watch.
Now about sound, it's amazing. The 2 opening sequences and ending sequences are all so amazing. Especially the amazing opening from Eve and the great ending from ALI. After that, there's the voice acting. Most people can't differentiate between good voice acting and bad voice acting, but I have noticed that a good amount of anime often fail at properly delivering dialogues. JJK's voice acting feels genuine and natural, so big props to the talented voice actors. Soundtrack is also quite lacking. It's not the best there is, but it works. Of course, I don't expect all anime to have Sawano level soundtracks.
Another thing that I need to separately mention are the eye catchers. If you don't know what eye catchers are, they are those intro type of clips that are often in the middle of an episode. JJK's eye catchers are so captivating, they have this horror-y feeling to it.
Now to sum it all up in one sentence: Jujutsu Kaisen is great.
JJK has to be one of the greatest new gen shounens. As for whether you should watch it or not- YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD. I don't always tell people so confidently to watch an anime. It is the start of a new era through Jujutsu Kaisen, and I'm damn interested to see where it's gonna go from here. See you all in the next season!",9,Twumi

                *Contains minor spoilers*
For me the Shōnen Genre differs in itself into two different categories. The distinct difference can be seen starting from the first episode. It involves the protagonist’s motive and the cause of his journey. Known classics such as HunterxHunter, Naruto and the newly added Black Clover have their characters simply wanting to become stronger and starts through “aspirations”. Gon wanting to be a hunter like his father, Naruto wanting to become the next hokage, Asta wanting to be the Wizard King.
In contrast, Jujutsu Kaisen derives from misfortune and not having a choice. Yuji Itadori consumes Sukuna’s curse and at that moment, he becomes
                  the protagonist. Not through aspiration but as an outcome of his misfortune. One can possibly see the similarity between “Kimetsu no Yaiba” where the normal lives of the protagonists get disturbed and are left with no choice but to become a “jujutsu sorcerer” and “demon slayer” respectively.
If you are a fan of shonen in general and have liked Kimetsu no Yaiba, you are very likely to enjoy Jujutsu Kaisen as much.
It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Jujutsu Kaisen is a mixture of Shōnen and Seinen at this point. The dark theme of curses and the mangaka not being afraid to put the cast in danger with actual consequences is always welcome in my book.
It is very nice to see how Sukuna's curse works. The protagonist doesn't simply absorb the power of the curse in his case but he bears Sukuna. Seeing Sukuna fight and his interactions with the world and other curses carries the show to what it is. It mustn't be forgotten that Sukuna isn't an ally to the Jujutsu Sorcerers and Yuji. Sukuna is basically a double-edged weapon and in the first couple of episodes we see the consequences of overly relying on Sukuna and how problematic he can become for the protagonist (""The Cursed Wombs Earthly Existence"" arc).
The cast overall compliments each other. There are comedic moments but it isn’t overdone. When the show is serious the mangaka doesn’t ruin it with very silly moments. It is very much enjoyable to see Yuji and Nobara having their moments of being fascinated by Tokyo every now and then. I’m sure that many of the viewers would actually relate and find it hilarious.
While it doesn't pose a problem for me, as a ""Shōnen Jump"" series, the characters are made through the typical archetypes that have been used in most of the successful series in this genre. For me, this is not a problem and I enjoy the formula itself. While the characters follow the same tropes as most shonen series, do not think that the characters in Jujutsu Kaisen will act immature and do silly things. The characters all feel very genuine and charming in their own ways. Yuji, the protagonist, gives off how mature he is compared to most other shonen protagonists. How he reflected on his grandfather's death and how he embraced that the only possible way of living for him was to become a jujutsu sorcerer after consuming Sukuna's curse.
While I may have said that the characters are through the typical archetypes, Jujutsu Kaisen has something very interesting that isn't necessarily made this good in other shonen series. It involves how the mangaka gradually develops the characters through events. The mangaka uses monologues and makes the characters reflect on their actions and where he reveals their true motives and who they truly are. Dialogues between characters and monologues strengthen the character which turns these one-dimensional characters into genuine characters that are actually well developed over the course of the show. While the first episode is a simple introduction to how Megumi and Yuji get to be involved with each other. In the next arcs, the characters naturally get to bond with each other. Megumi is a character that keeps his emotions to himself and doesn't show his true thoughts. By using monologues the mangaka manages to further give depth to Megumi's character. We get to see the character's ideals and how he came to these conclusions through the flashbacks provided. The mangaka manages to turn these superficial characters into well fledged out genuine people through the course of the show.
In episode 5, we see how Sukuna manages to take Yuji as a hostage. This unexpected turn of events is masterfully used by the mangaka where we can get to see how Megumin will act in this tough situation and what he truly thinks about his friends and Yuji which bears Sukuna's curse. He puts in dialogues that further develop and gradually improves the one-dimensional tropes of the characters. We get to see Sukuna and Megumi fight, while this happens we see flashbacks from Megumi's past life and not only that, the author connects Megumi's flashbacks with the actions he has taken so far in the show. The flashbacks strengthen Megumi's motives, he becomes much more believable for the viewers. We get to understand that Megumi isn't simply just a character that saves character cause he is a ""shonen character"". We get to see how deeply he cared for other people in his past life, and how he became a jujutsu sorcerer to save other people and this leads to us understand why he deeply cares about Yuji while they haven't known each other for a long time. 
The fight between Sukuna and Megumi is truly a showcase of this. The fight between them is used as a catalyst to further develop the characters. As the mangaka manages to capture the emotions of Megumi with flashbacks of his life and give these flashbacks to show who Megumi really is and show the ideologies behind his character. The motives and actions of Megumi become justified, where we understand that he doesn't save people just because he is a character in a ""shonen anime"". The mangaka successfully manages to develop not only the protagonist but the rest of the supporting characters at the same time. One can say that without developing supporting characters the protagonist can't truly be developed as it would come off as superficial. The world-building and characters are introduced at a good pace where it isn't rushed. Each character gets to shine and be developed in a non rushed manner. The viewers start to bond with the characters as we learn the thoughts and motives behind the characters.
In short, the mangaka creates situations where characters get to make hard decisions and reflect on their past actions and become much more believable characters in the present. This at the same time connects the viewers with the characters. While the characters of Jujutsu Kaisen might be thought of as one-dimensional characters in the very beginning, even from the first arc, the mangaka manages to show us what he is capable of developing the story and characters through well-structured arcs. The arcs, similarly to HunterxHunter progress smoothly into one another. As the later on arcs get hinted by the previous ones and the later on arcs are caused by the ones becoming before them. In my humble opinion, compared to Kimetsu no Yaiba, the writing is actually done not in an as superficial way.
Production-wise, Mappa has done a very good job of animating the series so far and the fighting scenes are very well done. It doesn’t get much better than this. The pacing is done very well and the adaptation is going very smoothly so far. What caught me most off-guard is how well the scenes are directed. How the scenes meaningfully change the focal point to what's more important and change through the character's perspective becoming the first person of view in certain cases which makes scenes and scene transitioning spectacular.
If you are wanting to try out a shonen anime this is as good as it gets. The story will just get better as we haven't really seen the villains as of episode 5. Jujutsu Kaisen manages to use already existing archetypes and plot devices of the shounen genre and presents it in a highly realistic and enjoyable way with interesting twists and well-developed arcs and characters.

                The thing about trends that a lot of people take for granted is that the more overstuffed a particular set of ideas are, the more likely it is to see either flipped on its head (see Shrek for fairy tale musicals) or given more offbeat renditions (see Joker or Into the Spider-Verse for superhero blockbusters). Genres being overstuffed, if anything, should encourage more experimentation and refinement.
Over the years the Shonen genre has gone through a number of these phases. From past its formative years with Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, you’ve gotten shows using the mold for massive tapestries (One Piece), those attempting to
                  rewrite the genre rulebook (see Fullmetal Alchemist), shows trying to test Shonen’s capacity for being applicable in distinct scenarios (see HxH), long-form parodies of the genre, and many that wallow in it without doing anything interesting. Jujutsu Kaisen is interesting in this regard because on paper, it doesn’t seem that different from the standard genre mold, but in practice, it truly understands the appeal of the genre and what audiences want to get from it. 
Jujutsu Kaisen’s first season served as a phenomenal introductory section into the story it wants to tell, presenting its plot, characters, action and tone in a way that’s easy to digest, but is simultaneously a very smart setup that stands out by committing to multiple angles. The show feels like natural selection, where Gege Akutami realizes the elements that people have grown to like in the genre and downplays those that haven’t held up as well. 
It can be seen immediately with the protagonist, Yuuji Itadori. While yes, he is a teenage protagonist with the goal to protect others and become better at some special skill, a lot of the more in-your-face elements of this are downplayed. He’s not an overly hyperactive idiot, an insecure nerd or a miserable angsty sad sack, but has a good balance of characteristics, being a risk-taker at important moments, more down to earth yet still very passionate about his interests should the subject arise. Character design helps with this as he, alongside the other members of the hero cast, have taller designs that fit the “cool rebellious teen” look a la Bleach, more than the short, childish look of many Shonen heroes. The uniforms convey style during day and night with their reflective black and blue surfaces, but Yuuji still sets himself apart with the red hood adding that degree of cheeriness to the rest of the outfit. Yuuji doesn’t just feel like an archetype; he feels like a character, one given an early sense of consequence, as well as an interesting comparison to be made with the final boss tier opponent in his body as far as power ceiling goes. The idea of this “manifest double” is played up more in the first half of the show than the second, but as Yuuji grows personally, it promises to be a unique recurring element. 
Jujutsu Kaisen wants to mix shonen power action, comedy, and horror ideas together into one distinct package, and all things considered it’s really cohesive.
The first half of the show is primarily dedicated to showing the ropes of the world to Yuuji, but even this basic setup is handled in some pretty fun ways. By Episode 3, they already have the main three characters banter together in an enjoyable dynamic that thankfully never turns into love triangle bollocks. A later episode has to explain how the show’s power system works, but it doesn’t have Yuuji sit in a classroom to learn about it through exposition dumps, or even white-haired mentor character Gojou talking to him about it one on one. No, Gojou’s an incredibly wholesome gadfly, so he pulls Yuuji out of movie-induced focus to actively demonstrate how Cursed Domains work against a monster who actively reacts to its use. This felt like a much more natural way to convey exposition, and even the more whiteboard exposition like the danger grade levels is conveyed with a pretty breezy, sardonic sense of humor. 
It also introduces the villains in a way that, while not outstanding, worked well in pushing Yuuji to his physical and emotional limit right before the second half started. The only weird structural issue I had with the first half was some backstory for Kento Nanami. It’s spliced right in the middle of a serious fight, where the circumstances leading to it and the consequences following it were far more pertinent than this one guy’s backstory. By the end of the season, he was one of the characters who left the least impression on me.
The second half of the show makes the focus of the first half even more reasonable, whilst honing in on the aspect that grew my attention the most early on; the many students from their setting’s magic school, all wearing the same swag as hell reflective uniform. The exchange event team battle serves as a great way to introduce a lot of these characters, their powers, unique designs, and their respective dilemmas without cheating shit later as story ramps up. Almost a third of the run is spent on this, but it’s infinitely more interesting than having a tournament arc in small arena cutting to stills of audience reaction since it gets out a lot more fun character moments. Akutami understands that we, as the excitable audience, want to see some coolass superpowers from a Shonen, and he happily delivers a ton of those that get to shine in this arc, from characters like:
-Nobara, the main female girl in the series that, much like Yuuji, doesn’t feel tied to an archetype, appreciating fashion and fangirling over exciting scenes, yet not taking taunts lightly, being protective of her friends, and having a coolass power of fabricating voodoo dolls with specially sized hammers.
-A guy who can only speak normally in ramen ingredients, but has incredible word power with increasingly higher personal costs against opponents
-An incredibly wholesome talking panda with very versatile fighting stances
-A bratty, yet at times comically deadpan witch girl with vantage via flight
-A cool-looking bloodbender that currently gets by throwing packets but’ll inevitably have to use his own as deadly consequence.  
-The adorableness incarnate that is Miwa; a super earnest girl with a simple dream and appropriately simple power that is easy to see as being friendly with others, possible reflection for the audience too. 
-Two sisters, Mai and Maki, with a quick but strong burst of emotional tension established between them. They each have some sort of limit, Maki being an incredibly resolute fighter but with a weakness to not see curses without glasses, and Mai being unable to use curses without an object but being driven by heaps of vindictive spite.
-A talking Iron Man suit with a twist that pleasantly caught me off guard
-Toudou, a muscleman who’s incredibly self-centered until struck at personal interest, in which case he becomes an increasingly earnest partner with a sickass skill. 
Not everyone may like all of these characters, but with their fun powers, interesting power limiters and/or distinct personalities, they nail the appeal of a shonen ensemble. The initial presentation of these abilities in a lower stakes scenario makes their introduction less intrusive on a wider plot. Plus, the majority of these personalities play well for whenever the goofier moments roll around, particularly in the post episode stingers, and episodes like #21. I’m glad the author thought beyond the overly standard elemental stuff to make the ensemble leave an impression. Only hero characters of note I didn’t go more extensively on are Megumi and Gojou. Admittedly, Megumi doesn’t leave quite as much an impression as the others, but he still has a pretty cool power over familiars and got more interesting near the end as his persona began to unravel. And Gojou is such a fun rendition of the typical mentor character, with an excellent design that’s fitting to both sides of his character, constantly holding back yet being comically curious.
Comedy doesn’t only exist for its own sake, but often as a way for Yuuji to bond with other characters in the cast, such as Nobara or Toudou. It’s given a lot of creative expressions, and for characters like Miwa, where their design presentation is intentionally at odds with their character, it feels fitting and adorable. Even Gojou’s comical overpowerdness doesn’t purely exist to be a joke by itself fitting his troll mentor personality, or an excuse for the animators to flex to a stunning degree, but an element actually considered by the show’s antagonists. Some jokes don’t land, but there’s enough characterful personality and expressiveness to them for them to not feel out of place, separate from more serious points to come.
As for the horror elements, Jujutsu Kaisen’s animation does a great job conveying the darker atmosphere when need be in the early/mid-section of the show. It really gets that a major part of horror presentation is fear of the other, and more specifically, body horror of not-quite humans, with some excellent creature design animated in off kilter ways. As Gojou states, everyone at Jujutsu Academy is a little crazy, so it makes the major characters in the show lean into these crazier designs when channeling immense power, fitting for a series around handling curses. Thus, the show has its main villain, Mahito, use body horror to startling effect when creating his monster army. While I wouldn’t call the guy particularly deep so far, the show does present a playfully devilish personality and show his capacity to manipulate others in a reasonable sense. His powers to twist the composition of both himself and those he gets close to in uncanny, distorted shapes play into the show’s theme about curse power perfectly. The show isn’t that scary, but it adds an additionally unique element for itself with these fitting and well-animated leans to body horror. 
Speaking of animation, that’s most definitely a major draw into the series. Director Seong-Hu Park and his incredibly talented team of animators making bursts of exciting, visually active battle scenes when showing off the characters and their various powers. Almost every episode has a scuffle in it, several of which have some exciting camerawork to make leadups to individual actions consistently dynamic.  Yes, comparing fights definitely shows that some look better than others (the sewer fights stood out the least to me), but relative to the sheer quantity of fights illustrated in the source, as well as the shonen anime landscape at large, it’s incredibly impressive and that the action was this consistent over the run. A lot of the common issues with anime fight scenes (placeholder backgrounds, motion tweens to cover up lack of movement, butt ugly CGI, long periods of chat in between blows) didn’t come up for me during the production, which really speaks to the work (or possible overwork) involved in the passion. Cursed Domains in particular get excellent scene-setting animation, and the unique way aura is depicted, with its aquamarine coloring and pseudo 3d “drawn” outline adds definably high energy to individual moves. This of course is helped by a pumping score, with Nanami’s theme, Fushigoro’s theme and Your Battle is My Battle standing out most among them. In general, while individual fights aren’t on par with ufotable’s more thinly spread action scenes, the impressive flexes from the team and strong character/tone aesthetic create a consistently visually appealing show. 
Jujutsu Kaisen doesn’t feel like a massively grand vision yet, so much as an ever-evolving series of smaller elements that combine well together when taped with strong structural decisions, but this feels in line with my natural selection thesis. In its characters, its story structure, its tone, and its ease to hop into exciting powerup action the animation team flexed over, it gets what audiences want from Shonen material as a strong start to a story while removing or playing down stuff that’s been less palatable overtime. I can only hope it improves further as the characters/battle conceits become stronger and its many dynamics continue to be tested.",8,SunlitSonata

                [Note: The mods have edited this review and now the opening paragraph no longer makes sense.] Have the shounen fans forgotten Yuyu Hakusho or even DBZ? Perhaps the real reason for the rants and raves lie in the annoying and inopportune character biopic digressions, extended flashbacks that set up every fight reversal -- in the middle of them happening -- as if the results of every power-up are predetermined by some childhood angst. Honestly, these would have worked in some key moments, but the card is overplayed -- and unoriginal since Haikyuu uses this extensively.
In reality, Jujutsu Kaisen is just like any other shounen that
                  seeks to ruin jujitsu like Naruto ruined ninjas. The plot structure is actually extremely similar to My Hero Academia, in that a bunch of children inadvertently find themselves in a school that trains their fighting capability, complete with families where magic runs in their lineage. The biggest difference is that the jujutsu world is far more incompetent, with powerful figures fighting petty familial squabbles as if the world isn't in danger. In addition, we get the same familiar arcs: the first run-in with the enemy, a inter-high competition that goes wrong, and ending with a fight with some enemy head honchos that give our heroes the recognition they deserve. If that sounds like a prior season of My Hero Academia, or something from the first season of Naruto, then it probably is. These are all shounen fight staples, cliches that have been around so long that they're even emulated in Chinese donghua Quanzhi Fashi, which also has a tournament arc that goes wrong.
I will admit that I do enjoy the idea of domain expansions, a powerful technique that alters space and time within an area to the user's will. It seems to have a more cohesive explanation than Demon Slayer's blood demon art.
There are also things I don't enjoy. For example, the entire premise seems to be one huge plot hole that questions the integrity of the Jujutsu Organization. Itadori, the main protagonist, is able to synthesize with Sukuna, the King of Curses by eating decapitated parts of his rotten corpse (ew). But what follows is a debate within the organization about what should be done, with a camp saying Itadori should be killed, and others shrugging their shoulders, saying they should just wait to see what happens. I'll leave to your imagination on who is considered the ""good guys"", and also why that might be supremely irresponsible. The group that wants to kill Itadori passive aggressively tries to again and again, with no one recognizing to foil these obvious plots. Then we have Sukuna himself, who saves Itadori because he ""wants to see something interesting"", in a scene that might be one of the most desperate cliche asspulls of all time. 
But overall the powers that be, both the Jujutsu Organization and the Curses seem supremely disorganized, petty, and full of bad ideas. If the world was in jeopardy, it seems these should be the last guys to be making decisions. Yet here we are, stuck with a bunch of armchair philosophers from Fate/Zero making perpetual moral posturing. I lost it when a character went on a long rant about ""proper deaths"", killing people's hearts as opposed to their souls, saying nonsense such as ""the human heart is a delusion"" or ""the heart is just the metabolism of a soul"". One character keeps obsessing over people's favorite ""type"" (of women), until the anti-climactic reveal that he was once saved by a woman. Another character goes on an edgy rant about being handicapped, to another character that insensitively says he would rather be handicapped.
These characters are all quirky, but not in the natural way. It's almost like they were designed with these quirks in mind, as a sort of gimmick to create angst and arguments from nothing. None of the characters have any likeable qualities. It almost seems that if they weren't all forced together by circumstance, they would all be loners with no friends. They all say stupid things just to be unique as a part of character design. Kind of like Rika saying ""nipaa"" or Kuriyama's ""fuyukai desu"", except it's not cute when a grown ass man says it, and it's borderline disturbing when someone who's being trained to become a savior of the world displays tsundere tendencies, or someone who's so immature that she thinks confidence amounts to talking shit.",4,katsucats

                I rate shit on enjoyment because that is what's important. Shit's lit, so watch it if you like high quality action scenes with moments of light heartedness but with a general dark theme. Mixes really well in my opinion and I suggest highly. 
Don't go into it looking for a psychological thriller with some really deep story. Because that's not what it is. Go into it looking for a well crafted show with a story that takes its self seriously enough to keep you in it but not so much that the light hearted moments seem out of place. 
In short it's a main stream
                  minded show in it's lore, story and direction. But executed greatly making the show worth watching on its other merits alone.",10,L1eske

                This seems to be another of those run-of-the-mill power shonens. It has basically the same story as Chainsaw Man up till at least chap. 91 of that series manga, and i think Chainsaw Man will give us a much better experience. I don't expect the plot give us anything special tbh.
What's great about this is definitely the animation and OST. I think this series is helped greatly by its good fight scene animation and if it continues to play into this heavy power shonen tendencies, i think it will continue to be as popular as it has. For this season at least.
Though you should not
                  expect anything special from this series tbh. Standard MC gets power from some mcguffin. He uses that power to fight for good, sometimes the power gets out of control. That's pretty much what these 6 episodes have shown me.
The characters aren't anything special either. Now i know 6 eps aren't that many episodes to showcase how deep a character is but i honestly don't think they'll get any better. The MC is as generic as they come. The female main gets the same treatment male japanese mangaka seem to give all their female characters and the other guy seems to be a mash up of emo characters.
Overall, if you watch this for the fights? You'll have a good time. If you're looking for something deeper? Nope",4,CloudWatcher
40748,"
                This show is as average as they come, personally, I was really disappointed with not only the show, but the hype it garnered for reasons I cannot fathom. If you want the most basic example of a shounen, this is it. 
TL;DR: This show is borderline bad. There is NOTHING in here that's better than other shows, and there are plenty of things that are truly dreadful. I only completed this show believing in the hype and hoping it would improve eventually-- it never did.
Summary: 
Cool guy Naru-- I mean Itadori with innate powers stronger than the universe itself beats everyone else by order of
                  magnitude cause he's an orphan and gets bullied. Oh wait, wrong show (His grandfather did tell him to be useful though so good enough). With the help of the most legendary jujutsu master Kaka- I mean Gojou, they go around beating everything down to a pulp. Oh, there are also side characters that get increasingly stronger to try and match Itadori's unreasonable growth like his rival sasuk-- I mean Fushiguro and the and fan service ""I'm a badass but also hot"" waifu sakur-- I mean Kugisaki to fill in the trio squad. Obviously no one can actually harm any of them since it's a terribly written shounen, but at least they pretend to. 
Art & Sound (9/10):
Let's get this out of the way: the only reason anyone cares for this show is because it looks good and jujustsu sounds like jujitsu and that's exciting. Art and sound are great as you would expect from a show that is literally nothing but art and sound quality. The fight scenes are great, but I would personally argue there is much better out there.
Everything else (2/10): 
There are curses or something that need to be exorcised, so we have sorcerers that may or may not have randomly assigned curse powers that can kill these curses that may or may not actually be humans with half-assed backstories half the time. 
DISCLAIMER: this all depends on what feels the coolest at the moment and can change whenever the show feels like it. 
These curses interact with the real world, but conveying that through storytelling is too much of a hassle. Instead we just accept random moms dying and entire school student bodies being seriously injured out of nowhere as being the unquestioned norm. But that's alright, because a character will do something funny the next scene so we can haHAA and forget about it. 
The curses dealing such immense damage to society are ranked from weak to mega strong, but in typical lazy shounen fashion, in our story they actually scale from mega strong to OMEGA STRONG AND BEYOND. In their very first mission, the trio could barely defeat a ""weak"" curse. *spoilers till next paragraph* By the end of the season they defeat THREE curses of the ""strongest"" category in one swoop. We know those curses to be nowhere near the strongest in reality, but the show built them up to be on par with the most elite of curses. Also everyone gets promoted to 2nd highest rank possible straight from the bottom to adjust for their power level spiking.
This is horrendous story telling. It's a Naruto clone with an even worse story. We have nine tails-- I mean Sukuna chilling the whole time doing whatever he wants, but only when convenient to the plot. At least Naruto had a reason for the big bad evil being sealed away beyond ""CaUSE ItAdoRI Is SpeCIAL"". 
We have no reason to like any of the characters. At no point in the story did I give a crap about any of them, why should I? They all have two-dimensional personalities with one dimensional attitudes. The show even goes out of it's way to claim ""Sorcerers need to be one dimensional to be powerful"" & ""A sorcerer's power curve isn't always gentle"". The show is self aware of how terrible it's own plot is and attempts to excuse it with more lazy reasons; I have no idea why anyone would argue otherwise.
Bad characters, bad setting, bad story (even by shounen standards!), bad dialogue, and honestly even bad slapstick jokes which make up half of each episode. By the end of the show I skipped everything that involved a side character knowing it will amount to 0 impact on anything beyond that one scene. Actually, you could skip any scene in the show that isn't sakuga and not miss out on anything. I really hope this show doesn't get a 2nd season and people come to their senses of just how mediocre this show truly is.",5,Aspection

                Its just an anime with bad/average story and no depth with masterful animation. 
And i would prefer anime with the other way round: bad animation but therefore amazing story.
Really average anime and doesnt deserve the hype at all. Only newbies to anime would rate this anime good. 
Feels like Bleach/ Aoi no Exorcist /Fire Force 2.0 + one dimensional characters. 
Its just like the Fate Anime series - best animation but therefore uninteresting plot.
I dont get why people hype it to the air. Its really nothing special, the motivation from the protagonist isnt deep. The characters at all have no message to us as watchers.
                  Its just all average, why do anime studious always waste their best animation on the worst anime. I dont get it. Thats my Opinion.

                Many of you probably won't even listen to my words after having seen the score that I gave to this anime. Many of you probably think: ""What a f**king retard, the anime he's been talking about is a god damn masterpiece! How dare he?!"" And many of you probably haven't even read further than these first three sentences. But in case you'll give me a chance to explain my score, let me give you a closer look into my thoughts, and let's see, why I didn't like JJK as much as other ppl did.
Story – 6/10
First things first: The story starts off right away with
                  our main character, hanging around at school, giving us the first insights of him and his personality. Also, with the death of grandpa, his motives of doing good things in this world and becoming some kind of a “hero” (that’s technically the false expression, but you can see it as a place holder) are revealed.
And here’s the first problem in my opinion, which isn’t the really the fast start of the anime itself, it’s actually that Yuuji’s personality, and more or less his only motivation to keep going on this whole journey, consists of his grandpa saying: “You’re strong, so help people”. To admit, this would’ve been completely fine if some of Yuuji’s past was revealed, and if the author decided to show how important  his granddad was to him. Just Yuuji saying that he was the only person that was there for him isn’t enough, and in the end this simple motive, which honestly offered some potential to develop and to grow, just becomes a dull somewhat, which clearly can’t carry a whole personality.
Focusing on the storyline again, Yuuji’s not the only character that gets introduced in the first couple of episodes. Basically the whole main cast with Gojou, Megumi, Nobara, Sukuna and the aforementioned Yuuji shows up in a truly short period of time. Being honest with you, that in particular went a little to fast for me. The mc showing up in the first episode is a really common thing, but so many characters at once destroy the opportunity to explain their motives, and who they are supposed the be in this whole construct. And those vague glimpses of their pasts that I’ve seen don’t give the viewer a sufficient understanding of those characters. But if you understood what the motive was, again, it’s just the classic ""I have to save people because person xy affected me back then"" kind of thing. Using the same pattern over and over, and changing it a little bit isn’t really a creative way of constructing motives. But hey, we’ve gotta work with what we’ve got, don’t we?
So there they are, our team on an endless mission of fighting evil spirits to protect the world. Although this concept has been covered in many, many shonen anime (the most popular one would be Bleach), JJK did this quite alright. The ranking systems for the monsters, as well as for the jujutsu sorcerers make it easy to understand if a situation is dangerous or not, or if the character is likely to have a chance or not. Thanks to that, the viewer gets invested easily into the matter, which furthermore makes this show uncomplicated to watch. What I like indeed, is how the show progresses from those missions to a battle against a big enemy, which has a threatening plan to take over the world. Even though this might sound as cliched as possible, it’s in fact well-done. The characters themselves play a big part in this, but I would want to get into that later. 
What the author did right in that regard was building the bridge between of the first and the second arc. In the first 6-7 episodes, everyone was just kinda playing around, and that phase was used, as I said, to let the viewers “find their way” into the show. 2 or 3 twists were built in, which had a surprising effect. The unexpected situations which it resulted in personally entertained me and gave the show a refreshing aspect. After that, Junpei, an intriguing and relatable character was presented to the audience, and he marked the beginning of the new arc. Through the newly formed cooperation between Junpei and the antagonist Mahito, there maintained a constant tension, because one does not know whether Junpei will give in to his anger or resentment, or whether he will decide to follow Itadori and turn to the good side. This situation only resolves when it comes to the showdown between Mahito and Nanami & Itadori. This actually created new tensions, because, if you’re willing to see it like that, Junpei’s suffering and hatred devolved to Itadori, and Itadori himself now holds a grudge against Mahito and his allies. Thus the author succeeded in a clever way to give Itadori a reason to hate the enemy from the bottom of his heart, with which a new enmity was born. In that regard: Chapeau!
But what could come next? Oh yes, there was something that shouldn’t be missing in any shonen anime: A tournament arc! Although it wasn’t a complete tournament, I assume that you can count it as one, at least it was originally planned out to be a tournament. Funny moments, tragic flashbacks, good fights, and my personal highlight, the friendship between Toudou and Itadori makes it all an enjoyable watch. The infiltration of Mahito and Hanami was pretty obvious to see coming, and that they also get away with it wasn’t surprising at all. In pretty much every other shonen anime that also had a tournament arc, the process was always the same after all: 1. Group A competes with Group B, 2. Enemy attacks, 3. Group A and Group B fight together to beat the enemy, 4. Enemy escapes, but actually reached his goal. THE END. Well, not exactly like that, but it’s often the case. I’m not saying that it’s a bad thing, it’s just kinda overused after hundreds of anime adapted tournament arcs in that way.
So, what have we got after all that? Intriguing characters? A refreshing story? I wouldn’t say that those aspects weren’t covered in the anime, it’s just like something inside me wants to tell me: “Hmmmm, haven’t we already seen this somewhere?” Maybe I’m just stupid, maybe I’m just not able to appreciate the “greatness” of this show, but in the end, I don’t see a reason to praise this as the next big thing. I’m one hundred percent sure that JJK gets big, I mean, it’s already massive now, but imo it doesn’t differ from the most shonen anime, of which some also have an equally interesting concept as this one. It’s done well quite in fact, that’s to say. Still, the idea it tries to develop already had a limited potential right from the beginning, and since it didn’t manage to pass that limit, the story’s sadly just slightly better than average.
Characters 7.5/10
Maybe I was pretty rubbish about the story, I’m sorry ‘bout that. In contrast, what I have to admit is that Jujutsu Kaisens’ characters really are something very special. Or at least some of them.
Let’s begin with our protagonist, Yuuji. You may be surprised, but along with Megumi, he’s probably one of the least intriguing characters, at least I see it that way. Yuuji is like vanilla ice; some kind of eatable, but nothing special in particular. His motive and goals are too simple in my opinion, especially the relation to his grandfather could’ve been extended to give his motive more importance (I mentioned that earlier). He’s kind of a funny guy, and isn’t cringe in any way, which makes it bearable to watch him. He also sometimes has his moments where he’s able to shine, and honestly, seeing that is quite entertaining. However, after all he’s like a typical shonen mc. You know, wanting to protect his friends, believes in the power of friendship, actually isn’t the smartest guy in the world, never gives up and believes in his goals and motives, etc. If you’re the author, ofc you can whatever you want with your characters, but I would’ve wanted to avoid any kinds of cliches, because nobody genuinely likes them. And if they suit the character well, they have to be executed in a really really unique way, which I haven’t seen often in anime. So yeah, he’s ok as a protagonist, develops like you would’ve expected it, and does the things you would’ve expected from him.
Jumping to Gojo now, what I like about him is the harmony that exists between him and Yuuji. They’re just a perfect match, because their personalities are very similar to each other. The bullshit I’ve heard that he’s just a bad copy of Kakashi from Naruto isn’t even close to reality. Gojo is a totally different character, and apart from his blindfold and his strength, he shares nothing with Kakashi. Kakashi is more the reserved kind of character, who calmly observes a situation and then makes some intelligent moves to defeat his opponent, whereas Gojo loves to fool his enemies. As seen in the fight with Jougo, he loves to play with them and teasing them, before revealing his real skills and finishing them off. His goofy personality fits perfectly in that regard and makes it understandable why so many people love him. He’s just the guy you have to like no matter what.
Nobara and Megumi do an alright job as serving as Yuuji’s companions, but nevertheless, they’re also good as standalone characters. Nobara has some typically girly traits, e.g. liking fashion a lot and caring about looks, but she can also get very serious, or sometimes even silly or funny. The same goes for Megumi, even though he’s more the quiet and thoughtful type of guy. But hey, that means more diversity, which serves to make this anime more than just a one dimensional show. Both of them also have their pasts, which shall create their reasons to keep on going, as same as it was for Yuuji. Sadly these “motives” are as boring (if that’s the right word) as Yuuji’s was, and that was clearly some wasted potential. On the other hand, I think they don’t have to be perfect, and perhaps everyone else says that the development they go through, which is directly connected with their background is perfectly done. I can’t judge about that, I only say what I think, just to make that clear.
Dicucssing the other guys from the school in Tokyo, at the beginning I thought it’s supposed to be a bad joke. A talking panda? A dude who permanently repeats the ingredients of a meal? I honestly thought that the author wanted to prank me. No, really. But what shall I say, even them I started to like. And one by the name of Maki impressed me much more than the others, she could even be a better character than Nobara. If you look at her strong and independent personality, you’ll notice that she’s really an exceptional person. In general, the female characters differ a lot from the standard weak and useless, often oversexualized girls in other shonen anime. Another compliment to the author at this point.
By the way, the same thing as for the characters from Tokyo also goes for the ones from Kyoto. But there’s one character, a certain man who stands above everybody else, in terms of likability as well as in terms of fighting skills. And who could be other than my boy: Toudou. My god, I haven’t seen such a cool dude in a fairly long time, and it was so invigorating to experience him in action. At first his well-known question seemed dumb to me. Why would you ask something like that? But in his craziness, he literally searched for his one and only brother. And when he found Itadori and both became like best friends, it was just so much fun watching them fighting together. And therefore I want to say: Toudou, actually you aren’t being hated, everybody f**king loves you!
So that this essay comes to an end soon, let's talk briefly about the antagonists, or rather the two most important ones: Sukuna and Mahito. Sukuna kinda reminds me of Gilgamesh (Fate) with his arrogance combined with his powers. His line: ”Know your place, fool” just fits perfectly to his character and makes him standing above all the other curses. It was mentioned that e.g. Jougo is technically stronger than him, but his presence makes the difference in the end. And that’s the thing: He’s the king. He rules all those other weaklings who think they’re strong, but only are small fishes compared to him. Sukuna also gives of a mysterious vibe, especially when he’s talking about Megumi, because we all know that he has some plans with him, which makes it even more interesting to watch. Mahito in comparison is more the likable kind of guy. He may have done cruel and bad things, but because of his often shown goofy and funny personality, I can’t take these actions even serious anymore. I think I actually sympathize with him, just because of his character. Now if that’s a good thing or not to sympathize with the villain who eventually wants to destroy the world is left to be seen, but I can't help admitting that he's a great character and that I hope for seeing even more of him in the future. 
Art & Animation – 9/10
The fight scenes go hard. Because of each individual's diverse abilities, there’s relatively more tactics and strategy that go into them than your average action anime, which makes them a whole lot more interesting to watch as it’s not just punching each other, and winning through willpower. It’s a mostly consistent art style, and if you saw just the style you wouldn’t be able to differentiate it from any other anime, but the studio didn’t skimp out on the elaborate backgrounds and set design. As for the animation itself, it’s smoother than a baby’s bottom, with constant angle changes and fast paced movements the scenes come to life, but also aren’t so crazy as to prevent you from being able to focus on what’s happening and not be able to enjoy it. The animation of everything from Cursed Energy to rushing water was great to look at. I loved how parts of the animation style occasionally changed, such as water and the backgrounds when movement was increased. Personally, I quite like the character design, though some people have said it's alright compared to its predecessors. Both the people and the curses character’s looks are deliberately well suited for their personality and skills. Some of them just look cool too, nothing too deep or thought out, just, yeah, looks cool. That's honestly about all I have related to the animation. It's simply extremely good! 
Sound – 8/10
The soundtracks of Jujutsu Kaisen are in-fact very well done. It’s not overbearing during scenes with heavy dialogue. Furthermore, some of the fight scenes in the anime are accompanied with incredible songs that just get you hyped. It's not a crazy good in a way to where it sticks out in the genre but it does do a great job fulfilling its role. Also the opening and ending songs are god damn sensational, I haven’t heard such great songs in a while. The voice acting is really good, too, and that’s no wonder, because many experienced voice actors and talented people worked on that show, so it had to be great.
Enjoyment – 5/10
Now it almost hurts to say that, but I honestly couldn’t force myself to like that show as much as I should have. You know, I’ve already watched quite an amount of shonen in my life, and while watching this anime, I only thought: “Bruh, that’s so boring, I’ve seen this millions of times”, even though it’s not the case. I wrote down why this show’s so great, and tried to convince myself to like it, but something inside rebelled against that. It doesn’t make any sense to me, and I really would’ve loved to like that show as a whole, but it didn’t work in the end. Btw, this doesn’t mean that I disliked everything of it, I certainly had moments, where I felt like: “Man, the shit’s about to get crazy!”, but in the next moment, the feeling was gone again. And that's how it went throughout the anime. Well what do you wanna do? 
Overall – 6/10
All in all, from the objective perspective, it’s a must-watch for shonen fans, even though the story might be boring sometimes. I probably would’ve given it a higher score, but I couldn’t detach myself from my inner feelings about, so I’m really sorry. For everybody reading this review, I hope you had a great time while watching Jujutsu Kaisen, and I also pray to the gods for a seconds season, because maybe my feelings will change then.

Shounen is arguably the most popular and the most disputed genre in anime. Many anime fans, almost all of whom are unsurprisingly the genre's target audience -- male teenagers, dote on Shounen and revere it like it's the best thing since sliced bread. On the other hand of the spectrum, some of the more ""critical"" fans aren't as fond of the genre and often criticize it for its simplicity and lack of creativity.
However, while that statement is true to some extent, there are several Shounen anime out there such as FMAB, Gintama, HxH, etc. that have received plaudits from the more mature
                  audience. In more ways than one, these titles have tried to do more than what Shounen is usually credited for -- mindless action and simplistic storyline -- and have succeeded at it remarkably.
Incidentally, Jujutsu Kaisen is one of them.
Originally a manga being serialized on Weekly Shounen Jump, Jujutsu Kaisen has gained quite the popularity ever since it started airing. And as expected, it has also gained a bit notoriety for being ""overhyped"" and ""a duplicate of other Shounen"", which is honestly very undeserved. While it is obvious that the series has taken inspiration from other Shounen titles, to label it merely as a duplicate would be seriously undervaluing it --
 Jujutsu Kaisen deserves all the praise that it gets.
To be completely honest, I would be lying if I said I became a fan of the anime right from the beginning -- because I didn't. Given its hype, I was fairly disappointed after watching the first few episodes; I didn't enjoy them as much as I thought I would. Like many others, I thought the show was kinda overhyped and mediocre. Needless to say, I was quickly proven wrong.
Stories that are similar to JJK are commonly found in the Shounen genre. After going through a series of major and unexpected events, the protagonist's life changes forever, and then he devotes himself to fighting off villains and monsters for the better of humanity. What makes JJK unique then? What makes it different? Perhaps its exceptionally life-like and realistic characters, and how maturely it handles its themes compared to the majority of Shounen.
The inclusion of dark themes in narrative isn't a new thing in Shounen, but the problem arises when we come to the execution. In hopes of appealing to the more mature audience, a lot of Shounen (and non-Shounen) anime half-assedly throw in a bunch of seemingly mature subjects without properly putting them together, which just ends up creating a giant, ugly mess that is barely salvageable. However, JJK completely averts this issue by taking a more careful approach to storytelling, slowly but steadily building its themes, and creating diverse and believable characters.
There are several themes that are explored in the series, but the most recurring and notable one is the concept of ""Curses"". Simply put, Curses are frightening supernatural beings that are born from the negative emotions of humans: hate, rage, disgust, jealousy, depression, and many more. The entirety of JJK revolves around the Curses, and the first real attempt at exploring the concept is done through Junpei Yoshino, a high school student turned recluse who has been a victim of bullying his entire youth. Junpei is not a side character simplu created to manipulate the viewers' feelings; he is fleshed out within a short period of time and plays a significant role in the story (i.e. helps shaping up a certain character).
And this is not only Junpei. Most characters of the show are decently characterized within a short amount of time. Granted, they are built on certain popular archetypes due to the usual boundaries of Shounen, but most of them display a degree of realism and maturity which by far exceeds that of most other Shounen characters. Through various monologues, conversations and events, the series gradually fleshes out the characters and their relationships. And perhaps the best example of this is our protagonist Yuuji Itadori.
Excluding his abnormal physical strength, Yuuji is an ordinary ""happy-go-lucky"" highschooler, who spends his time doing typical highschooler things and taking care of his bed-ridden grandfather—until one day, promptly after his grandfather's death, he finds himself dragged into the ominous world of curses and becomes the vessel of Sukuna, the king of all curses. From this point onwards, Yuuji frequently has to fight against horrifying creatures alongside other Jujutsu sorcerers, all while being subjected to the ugly side of mankind.
Reading this short description, it's easy to mistake Yuuji for your typical childish yet kind Shounen protagonist, but as the story progresses, it becomes apparent that there is far more to him than that. Yuuji's first encounter with a special-grade curse is probably the most defining moment of his life. It made him realize how weak he is, how little his life actually amounts to. It made him realize that he isn't strong enough to save everyone, or even just himself. This realization is later reinforced in episode 12, when Yuuji has to witness Junpei get transformed into a curse with his own eyes. Junpei's death is another crucial point in Yuuji's life, and as more major incidents occur around him, he experiences change regularly—he doesn't remain a static character.
Yuuji is a victim of the curse; he never asked or deserved to be in this situation. Yuuji constantly questions himself if he is doing the right thing, if he is happy with who he is now. He constantly struggles to figure out exactly why he is doing this, and honestly, he still doesn't know. However, there is one thing that he knows for sure -- he wants to save others from experiencing a cruel fate, even if it's only one person. He wants to bring a smile on people's faces, even if it means he has to come across some horrible things on the way. Yuuji simply wants to make people happy. His goals may not seem impressive to others, but to him, they mean a lot.
And that is precisely what makes him such a well-written protagonist.
This sense of realism can also be found in other characters. Out of all the characters, Megumi is unquestionably ""the serious guy"". He is seemingly just a mysterious, emotionless boy who is implied to possess extraordinary yet undiscovered power. So basically your typical Shounen deuteragonist, right? Megumi is backed up with rather strong characterization though, that makes him stick out. Megumi isn't simply fueled by revenge or the like; he is a lot more mature than that. That said, like a few other characters, he isn't fully fleshed out yet, and it isn't until the final arc that the series starts focusing on him. This may seem like a major issue, but it is justifiable given the nature of the story, which I will talk about a bit later.
Despite not being a comedy anime, comedy is indeed an essential part of Jujutsu Kaisen. The series has its fair share of jokes and light-hearted moments, which is to be expected considering that it is primarily targeted towards a Shounen demographic. Fortunately, the comedy of the show is mostly very charming and humorous. Rather than relying on only two or three characters to deliver all the jokes (which seems to be the case with a lot of action series), JJK utilizes its diverse cast to do that. I mean, there's a giant talking panda as a crucial side character. How cool is that?
That said, I do have one gripe with the comedy: it can be too overwhelming sometimes. The comedy is mostly separated from the serious content so it doesn't feel distracting, but that's not always the case. For instance, I had a few issues with how the fight between Yuuji and Toudou was presented -- not because of the fight itself, but because of how intervening the comedy felt to me. However, I do believe that it's more a personal issue than an objective one and shouldn't be problematic for most other viewers.
A lot of Shounen anime suffer from weak female characters, which is understandable in some cases, but most of the times, it's because of the sad truth that they are oftentimes treated as objects more than anything else. Many shows create female characters solely to provide shameless fanservice and serve as ""waifu bait"", a cheap, narrow-minded trick used to appeal to the utterly horny fanbase. Jujutsu Kaisen, however, is an exception to this; it arguably has some of the most well-written female characters in Shounen I have ever seen.
The only female of her group, Nobara is one of the strongest characters in the anime; she doesn't let the male characters undermine her presence. She certainly can be a bit silly, childish and irritable at times, but her confident, determined and kind nature is what makes her a great character. Nobara realizes that she isn't as strong as her teammates, but doesn't let that bother her. She realizes that she will have to face many difficulties ahead, but doesn't let that discourage her moving forward. No matter what obstacles may come toward her, she will keep struggling to accomplish her dreams.
The other female characters also make strong impressions, notably Maki and Mai, the Zenin sisters. At first, it is easy to find the latter dislikeable because of her seemingly hateful nature, but her harsh background, revealed later on in the show, explains why she behaves that way and fleshes out both her and her sister adequately. You probably won't find the other girls as appealing, but they are all unique and charming in their own right. As I said earlier, all the female characters are treated as actual characters with believable personalities, not merely tools used for redundant and appalling fanservice.
Like the above mentioned characters, pretty much the entire supporting cast is memorable. Quite a few of them have been given obvious quirks to expand on the comedy: Toudou's eccentric nature and wacky tomfoolery, Inumaki occasionally uttering random words to prevent his cursed speech from hurting others, and the previously mentioned Panda's quirk is, well, being a panda. However, the said characters are sufficiently balanced with proper characterization, and they indeed play a significant role in the story. The same applies to the villains as well. They are all well-written and decently characterized, particularly the main antagonist of the series, Sukuna Ryoumen.
Sukuna is one of the most compelling Shounen antagonists I have seen to date. To be blunt, he is an asshole. His smug face, overbearing presence, cocky nature -- everything about him just shows how big of an asshole he is. When Yuuji gets in trouble, he mocks him for being weak and laughs at his misery. When someone speaks slightly ill of him, it immensely hurts his ego -- if he hadn't been stuck inside Yuuji's body, he would have killed that person in an instant. However, even if he is the spawn of Satan, it's hard to dislike that guy. No matter how wicked he is, Sukuna is undoubtedly a great antagonist and the mystery surrounding him only adds to his appeal.
Now, I won't be doing justice to a certain character if I don't bring him up. And that character is, of course, the strongest of all sorcerers, or quite possibly all living beings, Satoru Gojou.
To grossly oversimplify, Satoru is a righteous version of Sukuna. Similar to his evil counterpart, he is incredibly prideful, sorta narcissistic, and carefree. More often than not, this kind of personality comes off as very, very annoying. But mind you, this dude is NOT annoying. Like his magnificent eyes, everything about him overflows with charisma. He is unbelievably charming, hilarious and outgoing, someone who you would love to hang out with everyday. For the brief appearance that he usually makes, he more than compensates for it just by appearing on the screen. Of course, his role in the story isn't simply limited to being a silly yet cool teacher. Although he doesn't appear nearly as much in the anime as the other main characters, it's apparent that his significance is going to be much, much more notable as the story advances, and I can't wait to see that.
This leads us back to the seemingly major issue that I talked about earlier.
Jujutsu Kaisen is originally from Shounen Jump, and considering how long most successful Shounen Jump titles are, it's not surprising that it will take multiple seasons to adapt the whole manga. And the manga isn't even close to being finished, which means that the first season has only covered the early stages of the story so far. It's going to take a fairly long time to fully explore the themes and develop all the characters. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, I can see how it would be a turn-off for people who aren't into stories of this nature. Personally, I didn't think it was an issue at all. Besides, that just means the show is going to get even better. And when it's already this good, I'm excited to see what's coming next.
In all probability, 2021 is going to be the year of MAPPA. Including the last half of Jujutsu Kaisen, with titles like Attack on Titan, Zombieland Saga and Chainsaw Man at hand, it is potentially their most prolific year to date, and I think they completely deserve it. MAPPA's animation has always been great, but they have stepped up their game in recent years. Their latest works like Attack on Titan, Dorohedoro and The God of High School are excellently animated, and Jujutsu Kaisen definitely isn't an exception.
JJK is arguably one of the most well-animated shows of the past few years. The animation is smooth and fluid right from the beginning and has no apparent flaws whatsoever. The school costumes look pretty sick, and while the artstyle is intentionally given a generic touch, it's distinct enough to differentiate it from other Shounen anime. More importantly, throughout its entirety the series consistently maintains a dark atmosphere and, on other the hand, seamlessly blends in with the light-hearted scenes, which is quite an arduous task to do. The action is spectacular. Every action scene brims with jaw-dropping animation and zestful music; they are always immensely entertaining to watch.
Speaking of music, the soundtrack of JJK is amazing. The score is mostly funky and classy, but there are several spine-tingling tracks as well that are played exactly when they are needed. As I said earlier, the action scenes are accompanied with electrifying music which makes the fights even more exciting, and thus even more engrossing. The voice acting is also very remarkable; from the smug and arrogant Satoru to the relatively serious Megumi -- it is evident that every character's lines are delivered with a lot of skill.
The first opening theme ""Kaikai Kitan"" is Eve's second song being featured in anime. It's one of my favorite J-pop songs of all time and perhaps the best song he has released so far. The sequence is also amazing; it perfectly captures the grim atmosphere of the series and contains a great amount of painstaking details that can be noticed if looked closely. Moreover, subtle details are added as major events take place (e.g. new characters being added, Satoru showing his eyes), which I find applaudable. The second opening theme ""Vivid Vice"", although not as good as the first opening, also features a great song and a beautifully animated sequence.
The first ending theme ""Lost in Paradise"", performed by Ali and Aklo, is very, very catchy and groovy. It is very cheerful and there's not much to critically analyze about it in contrast to the openings (especially the first one), but in terms of visuals, it is easily one of the nost stylish endings I have seen to date. The second ending theme ""give it back"" is personally a letdown compared to the other theme songs, but it isn't bad by any means and features a very soothing and beautiful sequence. On a side note, the endings are followed by short comedy skits called ""Jujutsu Scroll"", which are quite funny to be honest.
Bottom line, Jujutsu Kaisen is amazing. If a viewer doesn't go into the show with an ""Anything that is remotely similar to my favorite Shounen anime is instantly bad"" type of mindset, then it has a lot to offer. It's apparent that the series has yet to reach its peak, but even in its current state, it manages to be far more than just your typical Shounen. Along with its fantastic animation and kick-ass soundtrack, the series quickly establishes a dark, gripping storyline with compelling and true-to-life characters, which immediately sets it apart from many other Shounen anime.
At the very least, Jujutsu Kaisen is a great example of how good Shounen can be.",9,IrrelevantGuy

                Okay, i get the hype its pretty cool shonen and its been 8 episodes out now. But its add nothing new to the genre. You can see the series got influenced a LOT by other shonen anime. For example :
1. 1 teacher and 3 student, hell even the personality just kinda copy-paste from naruto even tho slightly different but u know what i mean.
2. Kinda about demons/monsters slaying??, well theres a lot anime that similar to that.
3. Spritual/magical/superpower school??, yea its not original either.
i know all of this doesnt mean the anime just ripoffing other series and bad in general and of course the series
                  has its own originality. But so far nothing special for me.
The Story so far just starting to get into the worldbuilding part, i cant say much for now. But the main protagonist tho, its very GENERIC shonen protagonist and his goals is very Half-assed compare to other shonen series. Basically hes just a normal highschool student whos very gifted in physical ability, has a bright personality, and got nothing else to do. And then he got brought down to these sorcerers world and just kinda follow the riverflow. (remind you of something?? yes this is basically ichigo from bleach)
Animation is so Good, definitely the top tier of this season. Fight scene smooth, magical2 things so smooth too. Coloration and Artstyle got no problem with it, its good. But i got problem with how the studio directing some scenes in it, in some intense scenes the studio DIDN'T did a good job building it up (even tho this maybe because the story too). You got these super cool character introduced, emotional main protags resolution, intense super strong creepy monster coming out of nowhere and yet it feels so BLAND. They did these scenes with straight-forward pacing (kinda like they did with god of highschool) and the music adds nothing to the scenes, i know this sound mean but literally the musics in this anime sucks. But i do like the atmosphere they potraited for the series, i dont read the manga but i think its perfectly match for the series.
Well its only 8 episodes, and i dont think im gonna drop it and its too soon to generelize the series as a whole for now. But its still good, go watch and judge it yourself i guess

                Jujutsu Kaisen is unlike any other anime I have seen before. When I first saw the trailer for it I thought that it was not really my style; seeming like a horror anime with obscure powers and weird monsters. Although Jujutsu Kaisen is this to a point it is so much more. As it does focus on the premise of curses, you can expect a horror aspect to this anime, which may not be your cup of tea, but trust me there is so much to offer in this anime. 
I have never had characters in a series I have enjoyed more as much as
                  I do in Jujustu Kaisen. The trio of Yuji Itadori, Megumi Fushiguro and Nobara Kugisake are downright perfect.  Yuji Itadori's comical presence pairs perfectly with Megumi Fushiguro's flare and Nobara Kugisake's spunk making this trio some of my favorite characters of all time. Then add Saturo Gojo as their teacher and oh my god you have some of the best protagonists ever, and Sukuna and Suguru Geto have the makings of being A tier Antagonists as well.
Another incredible thing about Jujutsu Kaisen is its animation. Its absolutely stunning, my mouth dropped at some of the fight scenes, because of how beautiful it was, and the fight scenes are unlike any I have seen before, they are just spectacular. 
The only knock on Jujutsu Kaisen I have is that it kinda moves a little too fast at times, especially in the first episode. I found myself a little confused at times since it was explained or shown so quickly, but I think the pacing does get a lot better as the series goes on.
I can't recommended this anime enough, please just watch the first 2 episodes and I guarantee you will be hooked.",10,JCPrp

                Im already on episode 6 and I am already bored with this anime to the point where I had almost fallen asleep or went of my phone. The plot doesnt catch my attention at all as well as with the characters being generic anime characters.
Yuuji is typical super strong, overly nice high schooler who got himself into a world he has never seen before after the passing of his grandfather who he made a promise with him to ""try to help others, save as many people as you can even if it is the only people closed to you"" and he to pursue this goal
                  along the way.
Fushiguro is basic as it come he's the quiet cool edgy character who is the opposite of the Yuuji who he doesn't get along but deep inside thinks of him as a friend.
Nobara is the weaker one out of the three of them. She's came to the city to give herself a better life in the city and find herchildhood friend. Overall the
only thing I really liked was the opening.",4,Redrebel12

                I'll give this review straight to the point! (10/10)
First , MAPPA studio has certainly nailed it!
This show has the potential to be one of the best Shounen Anime series ever!! This show has kick started really hard! 
I've watched 12 episodes of JJK and I can easily say this is the most entertaining series I've ever seen to exist .The show has a dark plot where every episode is so much entertaining and straight to the point.(no  fillers or waste of time scenes). Every episode ends with a cliff hanger(which shows how smartly they have put all the ending scenes of the ep).
The animations(10/10)
                  are undoubtedly the most fantastic and flawless. Every fight scenes are really badass and smooth as if it's very real. The amount of power levels & various curse(fighting) techniques seems to be extraordinarily huge and unique.
All the characters are incredible, beautifully animated and appealing. The dialogues are at another level(It's Dope!!).
There are scenes which are really funny, inspiring, also sad & emotional breakdown scenes.( All in one package )
The sound tracks ofc. are one of the best we can get! The music & sound effects are also clean. The voice acting is also wonderful.
For the story, it has been straight to the point & good yet but I can say definitely it'll become even better in the upcoming episodes .",10,EricPhantom

                Pretty Neat
So I came here after the hype that was the trailer and the wait for this show. Of course I did start the manga but only read the first few chapters and kinda stopped. I thought it was pretty good. But this anime made the experience different and hype as hell. This delivered some top tier animation and great voice acting, hell some decent CG as well.
Story: Some demon called Sukuna was killed and his fingers were chopped in to many pieces. This one Occult club found one of the fingers in  a package and opened it. Which attracted many curses their way.
                  Our Main hero who has superb strength and is pretty much a super human had the brilliant plan of eating the finger. It was revealed that he is a rare m,an who can become a vessel for Sukuna so they could eventually destroy him. He then joins the Jujutsu sorcerers and goes on missions with his friends
Characters: They have been pretty decent but nothing new. Yuuji is very energetic and kinda dumb like every shounen mc. He blasts demons away with his superhuman strength and sometimes asks help from the curse within him.  He is accompanied by Megumi who is the shows edgy boy. His ability is to summon shadow beasts. Ironically he uses 2 wolves the most that makes him more edgy. Nobara is the main female but unlike the stereotypes she is not useless. She still does dumb shit. She uses cursed nails or some shit as a weapon. Then comes best boy Gojou Satoru. He is pretty much like Kakashi. He is the strongest Jujutsu sorcerer. He is also pretty funny. Sukuna is just a cunt
Animation and art: It is great on both.The animation is smooth as fuck
Music: Good ost, good songs. They are pretty epic. The opening is a banger and has great visuals. The ending probably sticks out the most. Compared to the hype music the ending is pretty chill. The animation in it is good and the song is an earworm.
I enjoy this show a lot. It is funny and epic. Kinda reminds me of Demon Slayer. I recommend",9,YeeYeeAss

                Overall: 9/10
Now that JJK is over, I’m sure everyone who dropped it after 4 episodes or clowned it for being more trashy shonen are shaking and crying right now. While y’all did look foolish today, clown tryouts for the circus are next week. And if anyone STILL thinks JJK is an average shonen or sub-par anime, I would like to quote the great intellectual, Cardi B: “Hoes speaking capanese hit ‘em with karate chop.”
JJK is peak shonen that, in my mind, WILL become a masterpiece in the coming years (can’t wait for Shibuya adaptation holy shit man). You take the hypest arcs/features that took forever
                  to develop from existing shonens, and you’ll find them in the first 24 episodes of JJK albeit on a smaller scale. 
So what makes JJK so fucking good? Is it the mix of realistic and diverse cast of characters? Or it’s ability to incorporate great themes and subtexts without feeling forced and overbearing? Maybe it’s the classic shonen tropes reskinned and used to maximum effectiveness, or the INSANE animation sequences and visuals Mappa pulled off. I think that’s what makes JJK such a fun anime to watch, because no matter what you watch anime for, you can find something enjoyable in this series. For me, the big enjoyment factor was the added level of realism and darkness you don’t quite find in other shonen anime, which makes JJK more of a 30% seinen 70% shonen hybrid: an AOT but more towards shonen. I think Parasyte x MHA is the closest comparison I can think of to JJK for a non-watched, and even then it’s still so vastly different.
All that said, let’s take a look at why I consider JJK to be one of the absolute best shonen anime, and amongst the best anime released this year.
Story: 6/10
I think most people can agree that JJK has a very simple story. Although I will say, without spoiling anything, that the Shibuya arc will elevate the story aspect of JJK to the next level, so keep an eye out for when that adaptation comes.
JJK’s premise is very simple: monsters (curses) exist, people eliminate these curses (sorcerers). In terms of originality or creativity, there isn’t much to be found, although I will applaud JJK for having a very strong power system to work with (cursed energy works similar to chakra/nin from Naruto and HxH respectively). This means it’s easy for the average viewer to follow along in battles, and that we shouldn’t expect crazy plot twists/insane power scaling that ruins the integrity of the series.
It’s important to realise that “story” has 2 defining aspects:
1. The worldbuilding, storytelling, and plot
2. The message, themes, and subtexts being explored
That being said, I think JJK explores just enough messages, themes, subtexts and whatnot through its story and characters, that gives it that tiny edge over your traditional story. To name some arcs where these elements are a primary focus, consider the Junpei and Mahito interactions from the Vs. Mahito Arc, the all-girls battles in the Kyoto Goodwill Event Arc, and finally Megumi’s time to shine and the fallout from the Death Painting Arc. It’s a healthy amount of seasoning where it doesn’t feel forced at all, and quite natural within the scope of the characters and their personalities, which I’ll get into later on.
That being said, I gotta acknowledge the introductory arc, EP 1 in particular, is a tiny bit of a downer. We quite literally jumped right into the world of curses, without much exploration of the relationship between Yuji and his deceased grandfather. An argument could be made about how the trope of “family member dies which sends protagonist out on a quest” is almost immediately subverted by Principal Yaga, but it doesn’t change the fact the pacing for the first arc is a bit weird, especially when you consider how well crafted and paced every other arc is.
Simplicity shouldn’t be a killer: Dr. Stone has an equally simple story as JJK. At the end, it’s all about how well that story is executed. Dr. Stone does an amazing job of executing their story, and while JJK isn’t quite at the same level yet, it hopefully will be in the future.
Art: 10/10
No debate to be had here. I think anyone who’s seen a single Crunchyroll clip of this anime would agree, the art is top-notch. Impact, flow, key animation frames, transitions, and camera angles are all insanely well done: I especially enjoyed how Mappa played around with “first-person” camera angles during certain fights (Toudou vs. Megumi and Toudou vs. Yuji). Action sequences aside, still frames and shots were done very nicely as well, with the shot of Hanami posing while talking about becoming sages being some wallpaper type shit. And don’t even get me started about the OPs and EDs we got, all of which are absolute masterpieces in their own rights.
Sound: 10/10
Going off of the amazing OPs and EDs, god damn is the music and OST for JJK good. I really can’t get enough of it. You already know some hype ass shit is coming when certain tracks start playing, or when that eerie violin track comes on that shits gonna hit the fan. Most recent track stuck in my head is that sick rift we got when the trio crossed the river in EP 22.
OST stuff aside, the voice acting is extremely well done too. You can hear the seething anger in Yuji’s voice when confronting Mahito. You can pickup the traces of whimsical innocence and cockiness in Gojo’s carefree voice, or in contrast, the serious nature behind Nanami’s voice. I for one also love the sounds curses make. Shit can be disturbing and hilarious at the same time and I’m all for it.
Character: 9/10
If you asked me to pick one thing that makes JJK so much more different from contemporary and even iconic shonen, it would be this. The characters. I fucking love the characters from JJK, especially the women. And not for the typical simp reasons you’d imagine. For once, in the entire history of shonen anime (and I’m honestly not exaggerating at all considering how much shonen I’ve watched), we have finally witnessed truly amazing female characters. I have no fucking clue how Gege pulled this shit off (his mom reads the manga which partly explains the lack of fanservice and bullshit), but if you asked me for the definition of perfectly written female characters, you’ve got them right here in JJK. And not just one or two, a whole truckload of them. 
This is why I was super-peeved when people were shitting on JJK characters for being unoriginal, and comparing this shit to Naruto. As much as I love Naruto, you cannot possibly look at Nobara and Sakura and tell me they’re the same: anyone who thinks this outta be arrested. 
Nobara, like many other female characters in JJK, is an actual character. They have their own motivations and personality that’s NOT defined by the male characters around them. You pick any other shonen anime and most female characters are only defined by their interactions with male characters, through the typical sex/romance gags or damsel in distress stuff. While these tropes can sometimes be funny or good, it’s wayyyyyy too overused and honestly quite sad to see potentially interesting characters relegated to this. Nobara wants to be strong because she wants to be strong. Not so she can ride Sasuke-kun’s dick. Heck, we haven’t even gotten any serious romance shit going on, which should already tell you everything about the female characters. Maki wants to be strong to spite her family and Mai doesn’t want to be strong because she’s fine with living a “normal” life: this contrasting sibling dynamic was amazingly well written. Hell, Sakura didn’t do shit until her battle against Sasori in Shippuden. And Nobara? Fucking black flashed Kechizu’s bitchass in EP 24. Get that shitty ass comparison off the airwaves bitch. If you need any more evidence of strong female characters, I simply point you to EP 17. Specifically, the conversation between Nishimiya and Nobara on what it means to be a female-sorcerer, and Maki and Mai’s conversation on why Maki is trying so hard. Perfectly executed, chef’s kiss, mwah. Honestly can’t get any better than that.
Now, let’s look at best boi Yuuji (Gojo is the goat, different status here people). I like him because his goal is simple: help people before you die. It’s something I can relate to personally, and I’m sure many others can as well. This adds, again, to the realism of JJK’s characters. We don’t have grandiose goals like becoming Pirate King, Wizard King, Ninja King, Hero King, etc. etc. Even moreso, I like Yuuji’s development. Yuuji is like a tragic hero (this is truly realised later on but I won’t spoil it). He never set out to become a sorcerer, his life was turned upside down and he was thrown into this whole other world. And we see this reflected in the first 2-3 arcs. He gets his ass clapped, time and time again forcing him to realise how hopelessly weak and stupid he is. This guy straight up hit depression and shit, his lowest of the low, in VS. Mahito Arc where he really came to realise how fucked up the world of curses is. What about our other shonen protagonists? Naruto didn’t really hit this until Valley of the End, Luffy until Marineford, Asta until Vetto/Midnight Sun, and Deku basically never has (in the anime). But because of the path he’s committed himself to, after despairing and regretting, his only option is to keep moving forward (Eren stans Yuuji).
I can’t really elaborate too much on Megumi since he hasn’t had too much of the spotlight so far, but he’s the moody lancer archetype done right. He never feels too extra or unnecessarily cringe and isn’t an asshole about his views either, since he cares about his friends even though he’s normally grumpy and collected. So far his biggest development was in EP 23, where we see him finally discard his old perception of himself as a limited, extremely selfless individual. It’s a simple lesson but one a lot of people forget: sometimes, you gotta be selfish instead of selfless. Good on you Megumi for realising your own power and deciding to just go ham with it when you feel like it instead of being a team player, after all, “dying to win and risking death to win are completely different things.”
I won’t speak too much on Gojo since we haven’t gotten his backstory yet, which is more like his actual character development, but all I can say is he’s an overpowered character done right. He’s never used as a deus ex machina, heck, he’s often missing when he’s truly needed the most because he’s got shit to deal with overseas. 
As for villains, super well done on Gege’s part too. Mahito is an amazing villain, as is Sukuna. Most importantly, there isn’t any moral ambiguity in these villains, as you would often find in other series, and as Yuuji realised himself. These guys are just pure evil incarnate. Sukuna doesn’t help Yuuji for any other reason than to advance his own agenda, which even now we don’t really know. We also know Getou is pretty fucking evil, but the fact we don’t know much about him leaves you excited for when the reveal is actually made on who he is and what he wants. 
Side characters like Inumaki, Panda, and Maki get enough development so they aren’t absolute fodder and you can care about their wellbeing, but not so much where they detract from the primary trio of Yuuji, Nobara and Megumi.
TLDR, JJK does a very good job of making their characters independent of each other and realistic. It’s able to effectively use tropes to enhance, but not define each character. Add in Gege’s amazing writing ability and you get truly meaningful interactions between super realistic characters. Good shit.
Enjoyment: 9/10
Although the story started off a bit weak, everything just kept getting better and better. Literally, every episode, every arc, was in some way or another better than the previous one. And that’s really hard to do when most series just plateau at certain points: JJK is constantly going up, even if only by a small amount. 
Even when life as a university student got busy and hectic, JJK was something I could look forward to every week, where I could spend 24 minutes just chilling and enjoying a really fucking good piece of work. The mixing of characters, plot, action, and themes/messages is masterfully done, so it’s no wonder so many people enjoy watching JJK.
All I can say is, JJK does it’s job fantastically well: I strongly expect manga sales to increase even more now that the anime has ended. As for what to expect in the future, I’m sure it’s hard to believe considering how great JJK already is but it just gets even better. Whether it’s 3, 4, or even 10 years from now, the day the Shibuya arc is adapted and released, is the day JJK will cement itself in history as one of the greatest shonen to ever be made. And that my friends, is most definitely not capanese.",9,bulkyhog

                What is wrong with a generic shounen anime? 
I firmly hold the idea that, nowadays, originality is something almost impossible, because every new anime you see will remind you of x anime you had seen before. No matter how hard you try not to compare, the floating idea is always there ""oh, this is exactly the same premise as x anime"". Nevertheless, does a show need to be only original to be great? No! Of course, if it has originality it is something to congratulate, but if it doesn't, there's a lot of ways to tell a story and pass over that. It can have
                  a big potential and develop it very well, with a good soundtrack and an amazing animation. It can have a bunch of likeable characters that, even though they are typical shounen main cast, can be really good and memorable. It's like reading a lot of books from the same author; even though you have an idea of which path the book is going to take, since you know how the writer works, that doesn't mean that you are going to despise every book the author writes after you read a pair of them just because it looks like his previous work. And if you do, please, grow up, grab a few books from the same author or movies from the same director and take a seat and, for once, enjoy life. If you have good reasons and a lot of arguments against a work, do it, hate it, and do it with all your strength! But hating just because, is stupid. Hating on generic or hyped animes assuming it is mediocre or repetitive because it belongs to certain genre doesn't make you look cool, get over it.
That is Jujutsu Kaisen, a shounen anime that has a lot of things you have seen before, and a lot that you haven't. It has a simple premise: a guy eats a cursed finger and gets some sort of Kyuubi to lodge ins his body and becomes a magician so he can control that  beast. The only thing is that the guy that  starts existing inside him, instead of being the strongest bijouu, is the strongest curse. Instead of being the one with the major quantity of tails, he is the one with the major quiantity of lost cursed fingers all over the place. The adorable guy that ate that finger is called Yuuji Itadori, and the entity that lives inside him is called Sukuna, the king of curses, a strong as hell dude that can use Yuuji’s body to his own benefit and possess it whenever he felt like it. Oh, yes, and he can create a second mouth on his container friend’s face so he could talk to the rest and to not be excluded of the conversation. And to laugh at Yuuji, of course. 
 I must admit it. I saw the first episode by accident, it wasn't at my radar at all. And even more, I dropped it by the middle of it because I found it unattractive. After that, the anime got to CR and its publicity all over the platform kind of convinced me to give it another chance. And I don't regret it. When I finished that first episode, I liked it. It didn't seem to me the perfect first episode, because it's nothing really special, but it was fine. After that, every episode was getting better, and that's another point that I give to it. It's way better a show that improves every minute than one that starts with all the cards and loses the game by the middle of the show.
The humour in this show is, in my opinion, well done and in good measure. The dark atmosphere is successfully handled with some scenes that show you how crude that reality is. From the go, curses are nothing but a humanity’s creation. Curses are born from hate, resentment, pain and so, and that says a lot since the more  pain it collects, the more powerful it is, and there’s a lot of fucked up curses. And even letting aside that fact, this reality is harsh since people is too. We saw it with Nobara’s backstory, with Junpei, with Megumi’s family. Darkness and a sad aura is all over the place. The world, then, is decent constructed; is not perfect, but it does justice to the show. I can say there are some plot armour on it, based on how powerful Sukuna is and how he can manipulate some stuff in the way he desires without thinking it too much, or based on the dark energy and its scope, because Gojou, for example, is sooooo buffed that the world kind of fails to demonstrate his power’s limits. He protect, he attack, but most importantly he FLY. However, I won’t be focusing on that since this plot armors or exaggerations are lowkey subtle. At least, it is not the only weapon they have.
It has the typical main character that is pretty cheerful, charismatic, energic and that respects the dead. Personally, I loved him; if he was real, I would adopt him. His personality doesn't seem forced, he plays the fool without abusing of it, and most important, he isn't in love with his sidekick but with Jennifer Lawrence. Something that I really liked about him and the beginning of this series is how, since the first moment, his grandfather dies and throws him his last words. I mean, you start the show and you already know what motivates him to play the hero part. And that's nice. I 'm not saying is mythical, but is well made and gives him a little depth that is going to carry with him for the rest of the story, rather as a weight than as a lesson or a choice, almost forcing him to be a good person or to do a good for the others before he dies. Another thing, related to this, that I can save from him is that he doesn’t want to fight, he doesn’t want to be the best. He just wants to read mangas and keep doing stuff with his friends at the occultism club. He doesn’t have that typical MC complex of trying to be the strongest just because he wants people to respect them nor a dream of being the highest in a hierarchy. The only reason he is becoming a magician is because he is taking responsibility for his acts, and later on because he wants to be strong enough to control Sukuna in order not to hurt his partners. 
Itadori is a simple person who likes simple things, that is relatable, sensitive and funny.  He is so simple that that makes him a human, and as such, you can understand him, and his fears and his suffer. He doesn’t cry because his sensei died nor anything so dramatic, he cries because he loses his friends. He doesn’t behave as some sort of powerful guy, but he openly admits that he is scared of dying. He is so likeable that every person he mets, likes him. Even when he is insistent, he makes his way through them and gets to develop a good relationship with them, just like he did with Junpei, and I just can’t believe how much I ended up empathizing with both of them and their relationship and the natural way it was handled. Nothing from other world, just two guys discussing about gore movies. Junpei himself is a really well-made character that achieved his goal  of getting us all sentimental with his tragic and detailed background and story. Not gonna lie, his entire arc broke my heart, with just a bunch of episodes I could totally feel him. As a lot of people said, Junpei wasn’t a victim of curses, but a victim of humanity. Just when you think that JJK is starting to get slow, this arc comes in, breaks your window and slaps you in the face. 
Going back to the characters, I have to say that I’m a person who gets attached easily to them, as long as they give me something to like them. I don't usually like “cold” characters, but Megumi is a guy that I like a lot. Typical emo of the group, but at least he has a good background and doesn't mistreat the MC all the time, he even constructs a valuable relationship with him. In the first episodes you already get a glance of his past and after some events the viewer starts to witness his first perspective changes and how Yuuji’s personality start to take root within him. 
Nobara is a character that I also love very much, because she doesn’t exactly fit in the stereotype of the useless female character that is in love with the emo, and another interesting quality that differences her a little is that she is shown as strong girl who appears with a clear objective in her mind. Since the first moment, she is a character with a part to achieve, an objective of starting a new life on her own and to chase after someone of her past in order to make peace with her and herself, and that’s pretty good. She fights a lot with Itadori in a comedic way and it’s a humour I personally enjoy because it’s well settled and the anime doesn’t abuse of it, she doesn’t get to the point of being unbearable, not even close. Yes, they argue all the time because they like to annoy the other one, especially her, but at the same time they develop an estimable partnership. Overall, I liked her since her first moment, and even more after seeing how confident she is even though her mistakes and her debilities, and how she doesn’t think of the main characters’ dicks. And the way she wanted to beat Mai just because she ruined her clothes cracked me up. 
“I love to look pretty as much as I love being strong”. That’s the woman I needed. More characters like Nobara, and even more like Maki, please. 
The other students are pretty interesting, every one of them: Maki, PANDA, Mechamaru. However, braindead muscles guys are my weakness, I’m not going to lie. Toudou is one of the best things of this show. He is one of those that are insanely strong and that enjoy having a good fight and that even enjoy losing if their opponent was better than them. He is an idol’s fan and takes every oportunity to demonstrate he is straight, considering a man’s taste in women as a matter of life and death. This guy can’t be taken seriously but damn, he made me laugh a lot, and really impressed me with his skills. His clean-punch fight against Itadori is AMAZING. No power-ups, no abilities getting out of nowhere, just two guys throwing fists and taking advantage of their surroundings. Excellent animation, choreography, feelings and the little talk. That fight is just so well done. And, of course, my favourite thing about that episode was his evangelism. He doesn’t become Itadori’s friend because Itadori told him his tragic backstory and told him “we are the same”. No, Toudou become’s Yuuji’s friend because they share opinions in their perfect type of woman, and their favourite butt: Jennifer Lawrence. You guys should just break the tension by opening a Jennifer’s fan club. I’m joining, you know.
If you just tell me that “these are characters with nothing special and that you will eventually forget them”, well then, I’m sorry about your memory and how bad it is to not remember these guys. If you stick to that argument, then you just didn’t want you to like them.
Now, about animation and sound I have nothing to say. MAPPA nailed it. No complaints, I love this studio and didn’t disappoint me here. And the sound, what can I say? Everybody talks about Lost in Paradise. I mean, it’s an awesome ending, not only because of the song, but the art on it. The OP is decent too, and beyond it, the OST along the episodes is noticeable too. And what I enjoyed a LOT were the seiyuus. My god, I love Nakamura Yuichi and Suwabe Junichi. Having both of them in this series were a gift to me, specially Junichi, who voiced Sukuna and did a very memorable job.
In conclusion, Jujutsu Kaisen is the generic shounen anime that has its unique things that makes it a very good anime and even better than a lot of its predecessors. This show proves my point that you don’t need a perfect originality to make an excellent work done with lovable characters and a pretty well world building. From an idea to an execution there is a whole world and it depends on a show how it deals with it. This anime did it in a great way.
In my experience, none of its defects stopped me from enjoying this piece, and I hope I made myself clear that If you are looking for a great show, to have a good time and have some laughs with an excellent animation, this is for you. If you hate generic shounen because you are a superior human being that thinks that a person that enjoys a shounen is unable to understand Evangelion, then pass it and miss it, for the health of the community.",8,debochca

                Ah yes, rating an anime even when only 1/4 of the whole series have dropped are we?
Minor (first episode) spoiler warning.
Story: 7
Anime have done pretty well job in explaining the world around itself. Most of the elements like curses items, curse demons etc aren't very innovative because they have their origin laid in Japanese mythology itself. The only twist added is a group of sorcerers having the job to exorcise these demons... and they have a school. Sure, why not. Unless there are things we can expect in future, its a pretty simple scenario for worldbuilding.
However, the anime's true potential lies how its characters interacts
                  with this world (storytelling). How were they exposed to this side of the world? What gave them these powers? What is their past, motivations, struggles, etc.? What does the future hold for them? All these questions, mostly unanswered so far, carries so much potential that it can easily outshine the ordinary worldbuilding.
NOTE: From my point of reference, think Attack on Titan as peak of world building, Kimetsu no Yaiba as peak of storytelling. While FMAB as peak of both.
Art & Sound: 9
As always MAPPA did a really great job with sequences. Although, there is this tiny thing in my head - everytime I see the opening, I can't help but wonder why the opening sequence have crispier animation than the rest of it. This may make me sound like a kid throwing tantrum, but it just shows they did a less better than what they could have.
Character: 7
I am giving it a 7 because we are literally 6th episode in, and we don't know much about characters yet. So, expect this to change later on. Remember the potential thing I mentioned in story segment? We haven't seen much of it yet. I am really hoping story expands upon the characters more.
So far we have delved somewhat into the life of the main protagonist. So far he lived a simple highschool boy life with his grandpa until these events unfolds. Accompaning him is Sukuna, somewhat chaotic neutral personality with some vague mentions of his pasts. Overall series have only provided with shadows, if I may call it, of character's pasts and expecting some developments within 6 episodes won't be fair. So, I will park this one aside for now.
Enjoyment: 8
A series isn't really worth watching if it isn't keeping you on toe with your emotions. So how do you really enjoy any anime? Step 1, stop relating every godamn element in the story with another popular anime. Keep a fresh eye for once and give it a chance to see if it works. Step 2, Stop hating on any anime just because some cringy kid called it good on TikTok. Keep a fresh eye for once and give it a try!
Now, if you enjoy well choreographed sequences, go ahead and watch it. You won't be disappointed. Story so far have been making sense as well and overall pacing is great too. Really looking forward to how it's going to end.
Overall: 8
There is nothing game changing or highly innovative about this. But that's the thing, you don't need those elements to enjoy something. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, and I'm pretty sure if you like action-packed sequences with decent storytelling you're going to enjoy this too.",8,Apocalypx

                Jujutsu Kaisen has a “simple” premise, but that seeks to appropriate some clichés of the shounen universe in an innovative and illustrious way, almost as a tribute to the genre, but that ends up over-calculating its own initial proposal, transforming anime into a forced bull with references of the genre.
The anime doesn't even try to differentiate itself very much from a standard shounen, and it doesn't even need to. Much of the anime's approach is to get as deep as possible in these clichés. From the way the characters speak, even the narrative structure of the anime follows this logic very well. For those who
                  like it, anime is also a full plate for references that refer us to some famous titles, such as Satoru Gojou, which in addition to appearance, is also always late like Naruto's Kakashi Sensei. There are several other evident references such as this one, but that fit this homage to the genre.
The most amazing thing about the anime is how it supplies what it considers most important for the progress of the work. He skips the famous training arc; the way the characters get to know each other is quick and direct; the information is passed in a very verbose way, the anime explained and it is already done. It's all designed to be very dynamic and immediate, so the anime can make the most of its main theme. But in reality, these ideas do not seem to be perfectly reflected in the work, perhaps, not even close to that.
The problems start with the way director Seong-Hu Park chooses to stage the anime. Unfortunately, it transforms the whole creative approach of the work into a kind of methodical anime. In large part, everything is very calculated. The plans follow an ultra-organized and perfectionist logic. But then you should be asking: what's the problem with anime in over-calculating its plans? I say that it acquires a more contemplative relationship with emptiness. The viewer's gaze ends up focusing more on an aesthetic presence, than on its main theme. It turns out that the whole importance of the director with the genre becomes another way to aestheticize everything.
Most action scenes have the same pattern. It has a cool choreography, the camera moves dynamically, everything is very fluid and CALCULATED. There comes a point where it is practically possible to know how the fight scenes are going to happen.
The only thing really well developed during most of the episodes, was an association of the villains with the problems of the world. In my interpretation, it is as if these problems existed and the humans of this universe had to fight against this individual every day. The anime even exposes quite obviously in the episode where the Kento Nanami character takes Jujutsu off a clerk's shoulders, and she feels a relief from it. It is sad to have to talk about it, it's an idea that works practically in isolation.
I admit that in episode 5 I was already exhausted from watching the work. Until arriving in episode 17 to 18 (when the anime really gets really good) everything that happens in the course of the plot is directed in this same repeated logic. My surprise comes in the following episodes, when the villains interrupt the competition between the teams. He takes a more direct stance with his main theme and proposes a growing logic until episode 21. This logic is related to animation, which takes on an even more organic air than in previous episodes, and appropriates even more of its spaces.
Unfortunately, the final episodes suffer from it, put the heyday of the anime is there. Then another problem is forced to repeat again the same idea of ​​the initial episodes, but this time there is no longer a sense of danger so evident.
To end my review. Director Seong-Hu Park once again (as in The God of High School) tries to innovate and deconstruct the language in some way, but ends up not quite assimilating the way he wants to highlight this idea, doing yet another empty job with cute animation .",5,NBreviews

                You know, I was very excited when this anime was about to come out. I saw so many posts on Instagram and stuff, so I was like ""YAYYY, can't wait.""
Now that I've watched it... I really, really, can't give it a high score no matter how much I want to. I know MAPPA did a great job with the animation and everyone worked hard on it, and I appreciate them. However...
The reason I gave it a low score is because of the plot and the characters. Like someone mentioned before, I would also rather have a mediocre art with a good plot than amazing art
                  with a mediocre storyline. After all, if the plot nearly makes me want to quit watching it all the time... what's the point? 
There is something wrong with Jujutsu Kaisen. It's not the animation or the soundtrack. It's the overall experience with it. Like many others have said, yes, the plot is overused, the characters are nothing special nor are their interactions with one another. Even with 24 episodes, I feel like it's all just random scenes and fighting. I know... it's a shounen and shounen has a lot of fighting most of the time. However, every other shounen out there establishes the plot pretty well before or after 24 episodes. For me, the only good part so far has been Junpei's story, and even that felt rushed. One of the worst things about JK, for me, is that they do not explain the techniques, their functions, how they came to be, etc. well at all. They seem to just spit out ten thousand techniques and make the techniques work in their favor so they could win somehow. 
I don't know. I can't call it ""horrible"" because that would be calling all the other shounen anime  out there ""horrible"" since, for me, 95% of JK is borrowed from other shounen. I get it: it's hard to be 100% original. And no one is expecting that. However, the same flow, the plot and characters mixed together is very boring to see for the ten thousandth time without a spark in the story.  I feel like Gojo, who looks like Kakashi and acts Dazai, is one of the biggest reason why people are obsessed with this show. I don't know why he's overhyped. I mean he's cool and all, but I'm pretty sure it's because he acts exactly like Dazai and has a pretty face. That is all. 
I haven't read the manga. Maybe it gets better. Maybe it's super slow with development because they have much, much, much, more to cover. Idk. All I reviewed is season 1 and season 1 only. And that is my honest opinion.",3,sana_a99
40748,"
                This review may be a bit premature considering the first season is only halfway through airing, but I simply do not understand the hype around this show. Maybe it was overhyped, or maybe it's just genuinely mediocre. Maybe I'll go and binge the rest once it's done airing and see if my opinion changes. But for now, I don't get it.
It's quite a shame, considering I do actually find everything about Jujutsu Kaisen--at a glance--extremely appealing. The premise itself is very ""anime"" but has something very refreshing that I can't quite put my finger on. Likewise, the monster designs strike me as oddly western but
                  in a good way. Their appeal is in their simplistic and somewhat uninspired nature, not unlike Titans in AoT (albeit not nearly as unsettling).
For a show like this, the first episode actually does a really great job of intriguing the viewer. Despite being insanely generic, the whole thing still felt good to watch and had me wanting to see where it could go. That said, the whole ""protagonist discovers his courage"" moment had to have been one of the most canned things I've seen in recent memory. It felt extremely forced, which is a shame considering the actual catalyst for said motivation--his grandfather's passing--is handled decently enough.
Post episode 1, it really seems like things start falling apart. Jujutsu Kaisen feels like it's trying to speed run its way through character development and ""boring stuff"" so that it can get to heavier plot points faster and hopefully before people start losing interest. But this inadvertently makes almost everything happening in the show have almost no meaning or weight. Why should I care about Kugisaki's motivation for being a sorcerer? She's been on screen for 5 minutes. I know nothing about her character other than that she's a temperamental seesaw, and her shoe-horned backstory doesn't even do anything to address that singular character trait. The same can be said for Megumi, although his is at least presented with better timing. But the problem still remains in that how it is presented is incredibly weak. These characters and their motivations feel extremely shallow and one-dimensional. Even if there is still more about their upbringing that will flesh them out later, the story feels as though it's telling you that these flashbacks are definitive character identifiers. As if you should just ""get"" the character now. Which is a shame because their personalities, despite being pretty run of the mill, are pretty likable and interact well with one another. But the attempts to make them seem much deeper so early in the narrative actually cheapens who they are, in my opinion. To put it bluntly, you are being given answers to questions that the story didn't even make you want to ask yet.
My primary gripes with JJK are with the overall writing and execution of an otherwise promising concept. However, I do take some issues with MAPPAs action directing and animation. This series has got to have some of the most uncomfortable action sequences I've ever seen in anime. What exactly do I mean by ""uncomfortable?"" It means that my eyes and brain find it very difficult to process what's happening on screen, and I actually find it relieving when things stop moving. The fight in episode 2 is a great example. While I find the animation itself to be a bit sloppy to watch, I can't actually find anything ""technically"" wrong with it on a frame-by-frame basis. Although I think the over-exaggeration of Sukuna's speed could have been toned down a bit to make him feel a bit more solid in the frame. But what really ruins this sequence for me (and almost all other fights later in the series) is the camera movement. My God, who ever decides some of these angles and movement decisions needs to be fired. These low to the ground shots and the incessant frame shakes are very cheap attempts to make the sequences appear more lively than they actually are. The problem is that in later episodes, there isn't any sakuga to at least match the hectic nature of the camera movements. What MAPPA seems to like doing is framing the shot from floor level, so that they don't have to animate the ground. They'll then just loop the backdrop and any foreground objects such as railing to give the illusion of fast-paced action (even though it doesn't make any sense), and then lazily animate the characters on screen and hope the background is enough to trick you into liking the scene. Apparently ""MAPPA haters"" are thing? I guess I'm one of those, even though this is the first MAPPA produced anime that I've watched, at least to my knowledge. The one thing I can give MAPPA props on is their art. It's never stellar, but I've yet to notice a bad drawing in the frame. None of that cross-eyed nonsense on background characters that you often see in other shows.
I guess if this is one of your first anime, you might find it to be pretty good. And there's nothing wrong with that. There are plenty of bad anime I used to like, and still kind of do now, even though I can objectively admit they're bad. But I do find it bizarre how much praise this series is getting from people who should have enough context see this as little more than another edgy shounen. The only reason I haven't completely written it off is because of my experience with My Hero Academia. A show I love today but almost didn't. The first season of MHA is extremely generic and uninspiring for me, and it wasn't until season 2 that it really clicked with me. Had the second season not been out and almost finished when I started the series, I probably would never have come back to it after season 1. So I'm hoping that Jujutsu Kaisen can achieve something similar, and lift itself up by the end of the season to change my impression.",5,zikkara

                INTRO
Jujutsu Kaisen belongs in the category that began with Demon Slayer: Anime series that are carried almost entirely by their movie-quality animation. Their plots and characters are nothing you haven’t seen before, but at least everything looks gorgeous. The Bleach fans of old in specific will rejoice, since it plays out in an almost identical way. It’s why I often jokingly call this show Bleblechu Bankaisen. By the way, Bleach will have a hard time making anyone care when its last arc gets finally adapted and it’s nowhere near the animation quality of this one. Oh, and the script is crap too.
CHARACTERS
The character chemistry will
                  be the hardest thing for most to get into, since it feels phoney. Everyone meets and befriends each other in a matter of minutes, thus there is no gravity behind their friendship. It’s one thing to spend months with someone before you can call him an ally or a friend, and a whole other to bond in mere minutes. Every Jujutsu sorcerer in the show becomes part of the team super fast, so it never feels like these characters care deeply about each other.
Character motivations are another lame thing, since they are ridiculously simple. One wants to help people because his grandpa told him to do it, another wants to find her childhood friend, and a third wants to be kind like his sister. Holy smokes, it’s one thing to expect something less than trying to be the best sorcerer in the world, and a whole other to want close to nothing. There is nothing inspiring or grand in whatever they want. Naruto was instantly grabbing your attention because he was very sad on the swing, and Deku did the same by crying after being bullied and told he will never become a hero. There is no such thing here. And it doesn’t help how passive they are the whole time. They fool around waiting for orders until a mission happens and they go to the mission. Their motivations don’t matter one bit.
The only good thing I found in the characters is the protagonist who wants to eat a bunch of cursed fingers so he can turn into a super evil dude… and die, so that the curse of the fingers can stop hurting people. Quite noble. Also, his anguish while seeing he is unable to save every person he comes across or how he often has to kill in order to protect others is portrayed nicely.
A special mention must be made regarding the female characters in the show, which are often praised for not existing as fan service and for being strong and independent. It’s not much of a positive trait when they come off as unlikable feminists who are too busy bitching about first world problem and their role in society, while in battle they are still far weaker than the men. Especially Nobara, who fails at almost everything she does, has to be constantly saved by the men, and yet the audience is supposed to praise her as a strong and independent woman. She’s just there to be bitching, yelling, and being obnoxious.
ACTION
As I said the sole reason for anyone to watch this anime is the fighting, which is super duper well animated and choreographed. Just don’t expect it to be deep or something. Most supposed tactics are silly at best and come down to a character having broken juchubruchu powers and the other one not being able to defend against them.
-The characters will also have to explain their juchubruchu powers in the middle of the fight. On one hand it’s lame infodumping that stops the fights. On the other it’s a lame excuse for their juchubruchu abilities to work. That’s right, if their opponent doesn’t know what hit him, he won’t get affected by them.
-The ending of the fights is almost always left inconclusive, because a good guy will be butting in right before a conclusive strike, the bad guy will be running away, and nothing will be resolved. It happens so many times and it never feels satisfactory. It will be leaving you with blue balls.
-There is never any legit reason for how they cover up the destruction caused by the monsters. There is no gas explosion excuse like in Fate Stay Porn, or an invasion from the north excuse like in God of ten chapters per episode. The barrier they set up doesn’t prevent the victims from occasionally seeing the monsters, and buildings are blowing up during the fights. So why doesn’t the public know about the curses when they are not hidden?
-There is also a good guy who is so powerful, no bad guy stands a chance against. The only way a good guy will bother to fight is if there is a lame excuse for why Reverse Kakashi is not present for ending everything in a few seconds. Which is why he will be often mysteriously away on a trip, or a barrier specifically designed for him will be keeping him out of the fight.
-There is tournament arc at some point, because there can’t be a shonen without one, and it’s easily the most boring part of the show. There are zero stakes in the fights, since nobody can die and it’s all just an excuse for showing a bunch of flashbacks regarding the support cast. Too bad none of that matter since, as I said above, these people have no chemistry and never feel like a team. They are not even important, as stated by the very bad guys who openly said that the only two people that matter are the protagonist and the blindfold guy. What a way to fodderize your entire cast just a few episodes after the show began. Even when those nobodies try to kill the protagonist you never feel any tension, because you know he can casually return to life thanks to his inner demon.
DEATH
The show is full of permanent deaths, many of which are outright gruesome. They make it seem like anyone can die in horrible ways. Too bad it only happens to unimportant characters. There is also someone important who dies, but he was so stupid the whole time he almost deserved to die. That idiot thought some school bullies killed his mom, and not a mass murdering monster. Also, as I said above, the main character can resurrect whenever he feels like it, and then jokes about it when he presents himself alive and well to his friends (who have no chemistry and therefore are not much of friends). It takes away most of the tension regarding him surviving or not during the fights.
THE REST
The comedy is mostly miss for a shonen. I didn’t laugh once during the comedic moments, because they are all very weak in delivery and written for toddlers.
What’s the point in having a monster hierarchy? There are difficulty levels when it comes to the monsters and yet they can already defeat the strongest grade, effectively making the chart completely obsolete in the same episode it was introduced.
Training is a joke. Not-Sakura (Nobara) trains to get stronger by being thrown at the ground repeatedly. Itadori masters ki control by sitting down, eating chips and watching movies. I am sure this is far more relatable to the average modern viewer than the days when shonen characters were training in lethal martial arts over a pit of lava.",6,ThatAnimeSnobRE

                I'm really disappointed with this generation fans standard/criterion, animation isn't all in a Anime. I do think Mappa deserves this such a high score, but the plot of JK simply doesn't!
Very overrated. Completely Hyhiped.
Plot purely focused on
satisfaction of watching ""cool"" and ""extraordinary"" scenes.
Visual / aesthetic focused.
Has NO goals.
Appealing scenes.
Appealing characters.
Characters complemented by the story, not the inverse.
No motivation.
NO PLOT.
It seems pretentious history, with the sole intention of adapting to a Shounen.
Nonsense interactions:
Watch movies to practice?
Little Bears?
Hold hands?
Bring Yudji to battle out of nowhere?
The scenes seem to be filled with any meaningless interaction, such creativity that adds nothing.
Dude, for many times, I've just stopped the episode and asked myself ""what's the point of this scene?"", because I simply couldn't find it. There's no point in so many scenes! It's just a enjoyable and somehow ""satisfacting"" scenes, that doesn't add absolutely nothing to the plot. But the problem is, that kind of scenes oversaturated the main plot, so doesn't work!
The author tries to explain the environment and the reality around the characters but, ends up explaining NOTHING. And it doesn't even make sense.
To finish it, from my perception the Author of JK motivation be like: ""Let's make a Shounen that has great characters, great powers, great scenes, the story will only complement the characters"".
Purely pretentious.
I'm completely disappointed, and anything can change my mind.",6,lol_sampa

                Very short review just to answer if this is worth watching. IT IS WORTH WATCHING IF you're a fan of action. It's power system is well written and is consistent enough.
The best thing about this show is that every episode is literally filled with amazing action sequences, the characters are well-written especially their realistic aspirations, the power system is amazing too. Even though this can be just labeled as ""yet another shounen show,"" everything that a shounen should have to be really good, it has it. 
Definitely worth watching. Was not disappointed. Pretty okay premise, but everything about it as a shounen really rocks hard.

                Welcome to Jujutsu Kaisen, an anime filled with great animation, horrendous characters, and an average shounen plot.
Over the time the show aired, it gained massive attention and critical acclaim, rivaling even Demon Slayer in terms of commercial success. However, just like Demon Slayer, I see no reason to enjoy the show other than for its animation. In fact, many criticisms I have with the show are similar in line to criticisms that I had with Demon Slayer. Let’s start out with the thing that people have been talking about the most with the show.
(Spoiler warning of course)
“The animation in this series is incredible,” is what
                  I would like to say. However, the animation isn’t always as amazing as most people make it out to be. It still is amazing at certain parts, especially when it needs to be, but a lot of the time the animation is just above average. For many scenes which involve a lot of talking, the animation becomes very run-of-the-mill. These scenes have very little animation, usually only the characters moving very slightly. Of course, it’s unrealistic to expect all of the scenes to look that good, however, these scenes take up a majority of the show. People focus too much on small chunks of the show and completely ignore the bad elements. 
I must say though, when the animation hits, it REALLY hits. In almost every episode, there’s at least 1 scene of sakuga. The action scenes, regardless of the characters participating in them, the plot importance, or any other reason, look amazing. The number of different cursed techniques characters use in the show allows for the action to elevate to even greater levels. There’s tons of variety in the fight scenes. My personal favorite is the action scene in the final episode. The way the animation matches up with the music makes the scene that much more engaging. Seriously, that scene was like a flash of brilliance in an otherwise mediocre show.
To touch on the openings (even though it doesn’t affect my score at all), the animation is some of the best I’ve seen. Even better than the show's high points, the animation is on another level.
Now time for the thing keeping the series from being good, the characters. Almost all of the characters in the show, including the main trio, are insufferable.
Yuji Itadori is just like a standard shounen protagonist in many ways. TvTropes defines the average shounen protagonist as “big hearted, energetic kid heroes, with a natural gift that blows others out of the water.” This definition fits Itadori down to a tee. Now the problem with his character is not the fact that he fits within this trope, it’s the fact that he leans heavily into the negative aspects of the trope.
He seemed like a promising character at the beginning of the series. Although simple, his motivation with his grandfather and his whole “proper death” thing seemed like an interesting idea. The problem is, they did nothing to his character after the first 5 episodes. He becomes a completely stagnant character. He doesn’t have any meaningful interactions with other characters, we don’t get to explore his psych at all, and most importantly he doesn’t change. This is sort of a problem with most characters in the series, but we’ll get to that later. Basically after the first fourth of the anime he’s dedicated to 3 things: showing off how cool his powers are, making just plain awful or tone breaking jokes, or furthering the plot.
Megumi and Nobara I have less to say about, since they’re also basically trope characters. Megumi is ‘Serious Guy’ and Nobara is “Mean Girl.’ They have some flashbacks in the earlier episodes that give their characters some background information, but, just like with Itadori, they serve no narrative purpose after the first 6 episodes.
Gojo is also listed as a main character on this site, although I don’t see him as one. He’s easily the most interesting of the four, however that still does not make him a good character. His cheerful and laid back attitude despite the circumstances he’s in is interesting, but sometimes can be tone breaking.
As for the side characters, they’re a little better. None of the other Jujutsu Tech students are anything special. They consist of another “Mean Girl” trope, a talking Panda, and a person who can only speak through onigiri flavors. They also get some small characterization but nothing ever comes from this. None of them serve any importance to the plot.
One major problem I have with the characters is their quirkiness. Most characters seem to be very exaggerated with their personalities, making them seem unrealistic. Lots of characters are completely one dimensionally, and their entire character hinges on a single quirk that they have. The worst example of this has to be Toudou. His entire character is centered around the fact that he likes women who are tall and have a big ass. He is quite possibly one of my least favorite characters in anime ever. All he does is ask people what type of women they like and fights them if they don’t agree with him. In a comedy anime, his character could have been at least bearable. But in Jujutsu Kaisen, a show with lots of blood and death constantly happening, his character seems to be so out of place in the show. Every time he appears on screen I get whiplash from how at odds he is with the rest of the show.
As for characters such as Nanami, Mahito, and Junpei, I actually like them! They’re the best characters in the show, and make the Vs Mahito Arc the best arc in the series by far. All of their motivations are great, they get lots of characterization for how little time they are on screen, and each one of them has an impact on the plot for the arc they’re in. 
The most asinine thing though is that they completely get shafted from the narrative after that arc. Junpei ends up dying, and there is not a single mention of him after the fact. When Itadori’s talking about what a proper death means right after Junpei dies he’s not even mentioned. Nanami completely disappears, never to be mentioned again, even after the slight connection he and Itadori made. Mahito is the only one to actually be mentioned or show up later in the series, but even then he says like two lines, and could have been swapped in for another character for when he appears.
Basically, the character writing in this series is awful. Like...REALLY awful.
One gripe I have with the show that is completely subjective is the comedy. Of course, humor is subjective, so I can’t really go into why I don’t like the comedy of the series. To me, the humor in the show is very standard shounen humor. Anime slapstick never works with me.
The soundtrack is a mixed bag. The action music is good at most points, however the OST during the slice of life sections is horrendous. 
Jujutsu Kaisen falls into many holes that standard shounen shows fall into. Overall this show is massively overrated. Points of it are enjoyable enough, however those sections make up very little of the show. I hate giving out number scores but if I had to give this show a score it would be a 4/10. The animation is the only thing holding this show up.

                One of the best anime I've seen in a while. I haven't been excited in a long time, and this gets me excited. This is my first review on any anime, I am also not an expert. The art is not bad (so far) but it's great. I've fallen in love with the soundtrack (opening and ending music) that it's currently offering. The characters are on point, character development will definitely improve upon future episodes. What I liked about this anime is the characters, Gojou is an awesome character in my opinion.
That's all I can say about this anime. Welp, it's time for you to
                  decide, you'll just have to watch it to find out what's so special about it. Have fun and stay safe.",9,ZenoMeeno

                I will keep this review as short as possible.
JJK looked promising. Its art and style caught my eyes. 
The reason I began watching was because of Satoru (he is everywhere on Instagram).
I watched 24 episodes and I still don't know, wtf is going on.
Heck, I still know nothing about our main character Itadori.
I want to start of with the good things about this anime:
- the Art is very nice and I love the animation - openings are great
- I like how Itadori isn't a loud character
- Hanami was an enjoyable villain, which had an interesting goal
Things I disliked:
- characters are shallow
- fights between students don't make sense with the intention to kill each other (muscle guy and tsundere girl against other main characters)
- things aren't explained enough
- to many similarities between characters of Naruto
- Interesting aspects aren't mentioned enough (what happend to Itadoris parents? Why does Sukuna respect Megumi)?
- Itadoris main reason to fight is to have a memorable death
(could have been good but the execution is poor)
Main problem with JJK
Regardless of not explaining enough, JJK fails at Storytelling.
It isn't even bad, it is worse than anything I have seen until now.
Examples:
- why were Satorus eyes shown that early? It could have been more impactful, if it were introduced later. We know him now as that really strong guy and it isn't interesting anymore
- why not mention or show Itadoris past in some episodes or scenes to somehow get an idea, who he is, so that we can route for him!
- why not show more about that occupoccu guy, who is several mentioned with an accident that accured some time ago? 
- Junpeis arc was the most interesting arc in season 1 but it felt to short and anticlimatic
And most importantly
- If a character comes back from the death, why not making it amazing
I get that JJK wants to be different, but it was the worst scene I have watched since Cerseis death on GOT. 
JJK is a shitshow
Story: there is no story: 3
Art: Great: 9

The story doesn't really do anything all that unique, the thing though is that it really doesn't need to. Most modern movies and tv shows are nothing more than recycled ideas with slight changes based on the preferences of the author. As such, I don't see any issue with this, yeah sure it does have the whole team 7 vibe from Naruto but so does one piece, bleach and pretty much any other show of this type. Aside from that, the setting is quite different from Naruto as such the interactions are quite different and that I believe is where this shows unique
                  quality comes in.. so far at least. I cannot go into any further details without entering spoiler territory so to find out what I mean, you will have to watch it yourself. Aside from that I really do like the art style and the animation quality is quite good too, at least to me anyway - they really amp it up in the fight scenes and development of the environments within the episode.",9,Nega_Skoll
40748,"
                Maybe I'm just a boomer, I don't know, but boy was this anime overhyped. I really do not get why people like this anime so much. Its all flash and no substance. I really feel like the majority of the hype this show gets is just from fanboys/fangirls who like the pretty characters, Gojo to be specific.
The story is bad, but at times not even there. I feel like theres so many times where it's just events happening with no reason to the plot, and just random fight sequences just to have random fight sequences. There is next to nothing to get attached to with
                  the story. A boy eats a curse object and goes to school to learn to fight other curses. Okay, great. Already been done in Blue Exorcist, and it was much better there. The characters are a little better but not much. The best one, like most people say, is Gojo, but he is definitely not as good as people say he is. I only say he's the best mostly cause he's the funniest. Sukuna has his moments too but nothing else about the characters stands out at all really.
I'd say overall the best part about this entire show is the 1st opening song and the 1st ending song; Primarily the ending song. That is probably the best ending song out of any anime I've seen, and also has some amazing visuals with it. The first opening song is good as well and has some cool visuals too.
That's about all the real praise I can give this show however. I was really excited going into this but man was I disappointed.",5,Niko1987

                As someone who watched alot of anime like I mean alot, there are times when I question whether I'm getting bored to the same premise or genre over and over again. As of now, I am trying to watch more anime that involves heavy drama and psychological aspects. However, there is still a part of me that just want a simple story with a great animation. A simple story of an MC fighting evil bad guys with his/her friends, where the power of friendship and the teachings of the ""sensei"" inspires the MC to move forward to any situation. I literally summarized every Shounen anime
                  out there. Am I tired of it? No. Why? This is because of one shounen that aired last year Fall 2020 which is Jujutsu Kaisen.
Story:
The story of Jujutsu Kaisen in all honesty is really not that unique compared to any other shounen anime or anime in general. Heck, I literally summarized it on my introduction and yet here I am going to write about it. 
Even though Jujutsu Kaisen seems like your generic shounen out there, there is this excitement in my opinion to keep on watching and watching every week on how will the story unveil. Because lets face it, the story of Jujutsu Kaisen may not be unique, however you have to appreciate the execution of it. Unlike other shounens out there that tend to go long with so many heavy fillers and extra episodes, in Jujutsu Kaisen, I never felt that moment. This is probably one of the advantages of an anime having 24 episodes only whether it is shounen or any genre as it really focuses on the story, characters, pacing animation and many more elements to execute it well. Talking about the story, it is quite simple. We have our main protagonist Itadori Yuuji who, like every shounen mc, have unique strength and in some circumstances, he joined the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School to become a Jujutsu sorcerer and fulfill his grandfather's wish for him. There he is joined by a Sasuke-like character named Megumi Fushigoro, useful Sakura Kogasaki Nobara and their sensei Gojo Satoru. Together these three (well and other characters that Ill get into later) fights off curses whether they are small or big. I also think the power system of Jujutsu Kaisen is very intriguing. I will not go into it much further as it is such a spoiler however the simple explaination is curses vs curses. The premise is literally just like what I said, every shounen story out there however, there is a charisma or charm that makes Jujutsu Kaisen so enjoyable to watch even though the story is very simple. And it involves the characters, animation and the osts that I will explain further.
Characters:
There are things I want to say in general about the characters in Jujutsu Kaisen. First is that every character have their own charm and charisma. Most of them are likeable. Second is that most of the characters that are introduced so far have their own memorable moments. Of course the main characters like Yuuji, Megumi, Nobara and Gojo have some notable ones however, some side characters also makes the show really enjoyable.
Going by the characters, lets talk about the protagonist first which is Yuuji Itadori. Like I said earlier, he is your typical heroic protagonist however what resides him is the King of Curses named Ryoumen Sukuna. I believe Sukuna needs more moments honestly and he will probably have more as the story goes on. There is also Fushiguro Megumi who gives me Sasuke-like vibes but in a good way. Unlike Sasuke being a literal terrorist and literally hurting the protagonist Naruto in many ways, Megumi is literally a close friend to the protagonist and he himself is getting inspired by the development of the protagonist. That is why it is a good thing there is a big moment near the end of this anime where he truly shined more. We also have useful Sakura, Kugisaki Nobara. In all honesty, her trait of being so obsessed with modern things and literally Tokyo is really amusing that it blends well with Yuuji, making the anime sometimes comedic. She is not only a comic relief tho as she did some roles in the story and her past was really interesting. Then we have Satoru Gojo, who is the teacher or sensei of these three. Some say he is a Kakashi rip-off but I do not care because he is so cool and I understand why many people especially the girls simps for him so much. Thank MAPPA that Gojo is well animated people. Gojo is such a likeable character because of his traits. He is mellow, idiotic sometimes and fun as hell. Now going to the side characters, I will mention like three of them that really caught my eye and one that really impressed me was Aoi Toudou. He is probably one of the most out of place character in Jujutsu Kaisen. He is the literal definition of ""Do not judge a book by its cover"" and his tandem with Yuuji is just amazing. Next is Zenin Maki, which can only define as one word, charismatic. She can even be on par with Nobara. There is also Panda which is.. a literal panda who fights alongside the protagonist imagine that.  Again these are just the characters that I totally liked in the anime. Other side characters have their own quirks and characteristics that makes them interesting. Overall Jujutsu Kaisen presents such diverse characters that makes you want to watch them develop as the story progresses even though the premise of the story is very simple.
Art:
I cannot stress enough how godly the animation is in Jujutsu Kaisen. It is the main factor that drives this anime for people like me who got tired of shounen already. I believe MAPPA have done an excellent job on the art/animation department as it made the animation for the fight scenes (especially Gojo's scenes) really amazing. Not only that but also the way they animate the curses are quite unique. They showed the terifying features of curses whether it is small or big in a hand drawn fashion and made the aura of curses and powers in a perfect fashion.
Sound:
This anime is probably one of the few that have both openings 1 and 2 that are equally good as hell. Even the full version of the songs live up to the hype of the series. Opening 1 however takes the crown for me as one of the best openings in anime last year 2020 as well as ending 1. Ending 2 have such a bittersweet feeling and it is quite appropriate after each episode of the second half. Along with the OPs and EDs, the osts as well are composed very well. There is one fight that got me vibing to the ost and it involves Yuuji and Toudo. The ost on that part have resemblance on the ost of Persona games and that made me so invested to the fight and ost.
The anime does not even hesitate to really give life to the curses by making such ominous sounds to them and it makes the curses really scary and you can sense a taste of disgust if you hear it. That is realism right there. Overall throughout the anime the sound production is amazing.
Overall thoughts:
To wrap this all up, all I can say is that Jujutsu Kaisen is such a great shounen anime. It really did not have the purpose of going beyond the shounen genre and I think it is okay because the main premise is literally very shounen. Some people will say it is a rip-off and all however, like I said it really did not try to be very unique in the terms of premise or story. It is literally another shounen that you can criticize for being generic for all I care. However, with the characters, animation, sound, pacing and many more, it really lives up to my standards.  Some may argue that if Jujutsu Kaisen have shitty animation it will have lower score and I tend to agree on that. There is a chance people will just ignore it but thats just a theory and we are currently living in a reality where Jujutsu Kaisen is animated in an excellent fashion, directed well, have good pacing and likeable characters. And even though I tend to go away from my generic shounen trash, Jujutsu kaisen pulls me toward it again and I love watching this show. It is just an amazing show even though you could say the premise is generic. Overall I enjoyed Jujutsu Kaisen and I would rate it 9.5/10 but since myanimelist does not implement decimals I guess I put it as 9/10. I do not want to say it is an overall masterpiece as like I said the premise is generic however, everything makes it a perfect 9/10. Simple story but straight to the point, pacing is good, characters are amazing and charismatic, sound department is such a symphony worth hearing for and last but not the least, a work of art.",9,Zaber_san

                Jujutsu Kaisen was, basically, the seasonal hyped shonen, in other words, top animation with a poor story unfortunately. Let's analyze the issues that this anime had and then it's positive aspects:
ISSUES
1) Characters: Like in many fighting shonen a new ""good"" character appears, he/she meets with the main group, they became friends for the sake of it (because the script demands it) and, finally, most of them become irrelevant thanks to the power scale. The problems don't end here, their characterization is, also terrible. Most of them are plane characters with a lame motivations or they just follow the motivations of other people. For example, Sukuna
                  saved Itadaki because he considered him interesting, like the first big asspull of Boku no Hero Academia, Itadaki with his one episode motivation after his grandfather's death (he didn't care or remembered list after that episode). I understand the anime, or at least this is what I think, tried to be a style over substance; nevertheless, putting plane characters and introduce new of them for fill the cast makes this anime a mindless spectacle. It's not impossible to be a style over substance having, at least, a decent characterization for your cast. We have Gurren Lagann, Jojo's and the manga of Akira. In those cases, you remember the show not only for the action choreographies but, also, for the charisma of several characters (like Kamina, Joseph Joestar and Tetsuo), this, also, helps with the inmersion to the anime in much less time.
In order to avoid potential characterization, the anime set missions for the main cast. With this, the characters didn't have to be worried about anything else. I remember the show Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. Here we got, also, different missions for the main cast every episode with the huge difference that the characters here had a character development with each passed mission thanks to the analysis post-missions. Here, they complete a mission and pass by. This was unfortunate because the anime had the potential to make a character development, but it was really conformist in this aspect.
There are, also, contradictions or cognitive dissonance with some characters. For example, Nobara spoke, in many moments of the show, stuff like women can be strong too and can achieve the missions on their own, just to be saved for the male characters when she got in real trouble. Another character constantly criticized the woman taste of the other characters just to reveal, later, that he was saved by one. The few moments where the anime tried to had substance and characterization, it made things worse, like the allegories of the human hearts and the proper deaths. Now I understand why the writer limited itself with the characterization.
Itadaki is treated as a potential martir because he wants to save people exchanging his own life, practically. We hope this doesn't end being a meme like the case of Code Geass.
2) Deaths: Anybody can die permanently in this show, however, this is not the case for our protagonist. Is not only the strong plot armor for him, also, it makes extremely predictable the possible outcome of the show. Like the case of Boku no Hero Academia, where since the 1st episode the anime told us clearly that the protagonist, in one way or another, will end defeating all the villains, here we have, indirectly, the same.
3) Power System: By far the worst and contradictory aspect of the show. They introduced a enemies power scale and, later, the protagonists defeated the stronger enemy of that scale without so much problems. And this is not the worst, there's no training or justification to increase the power of the cast, like wtf. We had fighting shonen like Dragon Ball, Naruto, HxH, among others where they included entire arcs to show the training of the main cast and their progress. I'm not saying that all of these arcs were, at the end, good or memorable, but, at least, the writers showed that they had a little care about the growing of the power and experience of their characters, at least there was an attempt unlike this anime. Sure, many people could say that the power depends on the cursed spirits the character poses, however, this directly would contradict the sorcerer grades introduced. How can I difference a sorcerer from another knowing that they don't have a proper training or a inexistent one? Natural talent I guess.
4) Fights: Despite being one of the strongest aspect of the show, it's still having his problems.  The characters explain their powers and abilities in the middle of the fights. Is not only the fact that this is anticlimatic, also, the writer can introduce the ability or power that the character needs to defeat the turn's antagonist, fucking convenient. Also we have the classical last minute saves, overpowered good guys who helps our protagonists when they feel doing it (when the script needs it) and unfinished fights to keep alive the main cast.
5) Pacing: Like the case of several anime in the last years (not only fighting shonen), the anime presented a lot of concepts and information the first episode. After that, the pacing got slower until the anime arrived to the second half where the pacing was completely dreadful.
POSITIVE ASPECTS
- The animation is amazing and very fluent, the soundtrack is very enjoyable (the ending in particular is an absolute banger) and the fights looks spectacular if you ignore the substantial part of it. 
CONCLUSION
Like I mentioned at the beginning of this review, Jujutsu Kaisen is not different than most of the generic fighting shonen that came out the last years. I don't find any merit of it beside the soundtrack, animation and part of it's action. For this reason, I have no choice but to give it a score of 4/10. It could have been definitely better; nevertheless, the fighting shonen writers have been really conformists with their stories during the last years.",4,RomanceEnjoyer48

                Now, Jujutsu Kaisen is definitely set to be the next big Shonen, in the same vein as Kimetsu no Yaiba (the two share a lot of similarities too). But does it actually hold up to its hype? 
It depends. 
The show isn't bad per se. Sure, it's generic, and has the same kind of gritty tones countless of shows have because people seem to love it nowadays. But if you want a fast paced show, with an interesting enough premise and great fights you'll certainly love it. 
But if, like me, you mainly enjoy shows for the characters, let me tell you right now :
                  it isn't for you.
I've rarely seen characters so flat and generic. They're introduced left and right, given two minutes of introspection for us to understand their motivation, and that's it. How are we supposed to grow attached to them? 
The main trio, who we are supposed to root for, has 0 meaningful interactions in 11 episodes. The main girl is taken out of all the interesting action, which isn't surprising but is certainly disappointing. The main character is cliched but surprisingly okay, if we take away from the fact he doesn't have any depth and somehow takes inspiration from the death of his grandparent we've known and said goodbye to in 10 seconds. The 'emo character' is the same one we've seen in countless of shows, except there's literally 0 effort to make him somewhat stand out by giving him something interesting for us to be invested in. We know nothing about him, and his personality (spoiler:he doesn't have one) doesn't make up for it. There are other characters, all with interesting designs, and they could be interesting and developed later, but seeing how the main characters are developed, I don't have much hope. The relationships follow the same veins as the characters: are we supposed to believe the characters care about each other just because the show tells us they do? Aren't we supposed to... see it for ourselves? 
Finally, maybe it's just me, but the humor is trying way too hard and isn't funny at all, which spoils my enjoyment a lot.
All in all, it's a good enough shonen, but it really depends on what you're looking for.",4,PikAnnanas

                I do not get the hype, maybe I do something wrong? 
This is isn't something I haven't already seen in other shounen anime. It's like I am trapped in a loop hole and I am watching something I have already seen in some other anime for 700 episodes. It's your usual shounen plot I guess? I am pretty much enjoying this because Itadori is a really good character and I am kinda curious how it will work out with Sukuna. 
Some of the side characters are interesting as well, but I that's all. The animation is great and I had to say congrats to MAPPA
                  one more time because I really love what they've done so far. Their animation makes it way better but if someone else had it I don't think I would enjoy it as much, I am kinda biased with this company animation. 
I hope it will get better in the future.",6,nobaknim_net

                Jujutsu Kaisen is the best modern shounen anime... or is it?
Let's take a look.
The story is average. Nothing too much to say to it except that it's a speedrun of the usual Shounen Formula. Too much is happening in this season that I hardly remember anything that happened. It didn't have an impact whatsoever since the story's development is too fast. There wasn't any room to breathe in and take the current information, which makes me not care about the stakes since it is too fast and it happened so early in the series.
The characters are... decent. They aren't memorable or anything. Heck, I forgot
                  some of the characters even existed because the story didn't give the viewers enough breathing room to appreciate and know their character. So I didn't care about the characters at all. There wasn't any emotional connection to any of the characters.
Also, mildly spoiler, personal connections between characters are so superficial level that I even wondered why tf are they risking their lives to someone they just met lmao
In other words, there isn't any believable relationship between the characters since their bonding time was too fast that it looks like they are together because plot.
The animation is the highlight of this anime. But while it is fluid and fast-paced, it has a drawback. Impacts here don't really have any impact. The impact of their strikes looks like they are just girls slapping their besties because of a silly joke. They look like tapping each other.
Heck, even Dragon Ball had a more believable impact in their strikes lmao
Overall, it's good animation. But it lacks the oomph in its impact.
The music is okay overall. The OST is good, but the openings and endings are just decent. Nothing to say here except, it could be better.
Enjoyment factor. The comedy here is hit-or-miss. There wasn't any scene that made me laugh, so it's a miss for me. But that's just due to poor timing on their part. The timing of their punchline is too fast due to the fast pacing of the anime, which in turn, comedy and emotional stuff aren't hitting as hard as it should be.
Overall, it's a decent shounen that could have been better if it was more slow-paced or at least normal-paced.",6,ren0080

                Honestly i had high expectations for JJK as a manga reader. And I wont be shy in saying that i am not disappointed.
JJK has been so enjoyable to watch and i can't get enough
love it so much and Inumaki is brilliant in the anime
This is my first review by the way so I'm not too sure how to make it longer but i will say both openings and endings have been absolutely brilliant and EVE did a brilliant job with opening one. 
Also MAPPA have done a 10/10 job with the animation and I can't wait to see how they do Chainsaw Man.

                To be blunt, Jujutsu Kaisen S1 is a good looking mess of ideas. 
I did not start this show as a seasonal watcher, but as someone who heard it's praises and comparisons to it's predecessors, so to expect at least a decent cast of characters isn't too much to ask. Unfortunately, early Jujutsu Kaisen doesn't even try to make the characters likeable despite how hard the openings and endings try to convince you. 
Not to blame the studio for this issue, but the structure of the story is completely disorganised - not giving any of the characters apart from a select few any time to
                  breathe. The ending result is characterisation at best being poor. 
Animation is good but nothing to write home about. There is an extra coat of paint seen here that seems to be popular these days but the raw animation underneath lacks the finesse of what can be considered top tier. The best we see and what CAN be considered top tier is actually the openings and endings, but I don't include those when scoring a series.
As for dialogue, it has some of what you can expect from shonen but at times it can come off as overbearing - taking over some decent moments with a bunch of meaningless fluff. The comedy is a hit or miss, I actually liked the moments after the endings which had the characters disjointed from current episodic events.
Overall Jujutsu Kaisen S1 is average. It's good to look at but doesn't know how to portray it's story in a way that makes it's characters likeable.",5,VectoredPromise
40748,"
                Note: very minor spoilers ahead.
Jujutsu Kaisen, for all the praise it has received as ""the next big thing"" in shounen, is remarkably average. Sure, the animation is great and deserving of praise, but what lies past that is another bang-average, cookie-cutter battle shounen concept that has been done many times over. Of course, there are some minor devations from the established norm, but there's nothing particularly innovative about it. It is simply a (for the most part) well-executed shounen story that we have seen so many times before. 
To address the elephant in the room, Jujutsu Kaisen's animation is great. There is an extreme level
                  of talent and effort on display. There is a distinct lack of CGI that immediately puts JJK in a league above most shounen anime. My only real gripes here are with the art of the series. The character designs in particular feel largely uninspired and dull. The monsters in particular are, for the most part, pretty ugly (and not in a good way). Most of its scenery feels rather familiar and indistinct as well. Practically everything negative I have to say about the animation is related to the art.
As for the story, it's typical shounen fare. Unassuming high school student gets tied up in something he shouldn't and has his life turned upside down; realizing he has some innate talent no other has, he is drafted into a special high school to train and grow stronger within a carefully explained power system so he can save others. Sound familiar? Add in a totally unemotional death of our main character's only family (his parents are *gasp* mysteriously uninvolved in his life) that shakily provides impetus for his goals and we're off. Other familiar shounen plotlines make up much of the rest of it. It's not particularly unique, but not offensively terrible either.
The characters follow a similar pattern, but not quite as bad. Of course, our protagonist is an overpowered high school student who isn't terribly smart but has an unwavering motivation to do good. A perfect self-insert for the audience, as is expected. To offer up some praise, having a demonic spirit literally inside him that acts as a foil of sorts is fairly interesting and a good deviation from the beaten path. His friends are similarly predictable, as are most of the characters. Most are little more than cardboard cut-outs, but they're largely inoffensive and sometimes likeable, which puts them ahead of many other similar series (*cough* Demon Slayer *cough*). Luckily they're not terribly boring, either.
The soundtrack, while not bad, is unremarkable. Nothing about it is particularly unique. It's varied enough and usually works in whatever scene it's in. The voice actors (Japanese, anyway) fit their characters fairly well, at least as far as I am able to tell (I don't actually speak Japanese so I can only judge so much). No character's voice really got on my nerves, which is pretty much an achievement for a shounen at this point.
Jujutsu Kaisen does have a darker tone than most shounen but not to any real emotional end. In fact, JJK is fairly unemotional, even as far as battle shounen go. Innocent people are constantly seen dying in gruesome ways, but any emotions generated from it aren't really followed up with in the writing. If it's to make the story seem more serious, it doesn't work, as it's still a goofy shounen deep down--it's pretty much just an example of poor stylization to no real narrative or thematic end. It almost seems to be an attempt to differentiate itself from the stagnant gray blob that is shounen, but a misguided one at that.
Overall, Jujustu Kaisen won't change your life. It's nothing you haven't seen before. Its deviations from shounen norm are largely superficial yet appreciated. It's simply a rather good version of something you've already seen countless times before but with excellent production values. It's fairly mindless shlock, but pretty good mindless shlock at that. If you like battle shounen, you will love Jujutsu Kaisen, but if you are not a fan it is unlikely to win you over. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.",5,JuiceDid9-11

                After watching the first 15 episodes of this series I feel able to write a relatively well informed review. The animation style is undoubtedly crisp and the fight scenes are a joy to watch while they last. However, the pitfall of this anime is not the characters, art or even the story itself but the way in which the director of the series finds it necessary for there to be an incalculable number of flashbacks in every episode. I am a fan of a few well placed flashbacks to explain prior events, but a lot can be said for a simple chronologically ordered timeline that
                  coherently conveys what is going on in the story. The haphazard and seamless insertion of these flashbacks, constantly, slows down the pace of the anime in the most boring fashion possible. Even though this anime does seem to have all the ingredients to make a good Shounen: good art, good music, good fights and good characters, the lacklustre direction undoubtedly dooms the series to mediocrity in the most frustrating way.",6,hazza3576

                Everything is well animated and sounds great throughout the 24 episodes. The voice acting was also done well. However, other than that there isn't much to praise. Don't get me wrong, I don't think its bad (although what I'm gonna say next probably is going make it sound like I do), its entertaining enough, I just found it a bit shallow. Here are some of the problems that I had with it. I feel like Throughout the 24 episodes I keep waiting for the story to get ""started"" but then it never really gets anywhere: monsters appear, main characters fight monsters, repeat. The monster-of-the-week style
                  isn't necessarily bad on it's own but there isn't really a through-line or a larger plot point to tie each part together with any sense of weight or urgency. Most characters also don't really have much of a development other than Fushiguro; even though I watched 24 episodes I don't really feel like I know the characters that much better than during the beginning.",6,allocation

                This is one of the more overhyped anime as of recent. While the animation/art is great, some of the best out there, it sometimes feels like that's all the show is. Great animated fight scenes with bland-uninteresting characters/motivations. I find that the main character doesn't carry this show well. He is generic, and his reasoning for doing anything is based on the opinions of others, he is quite hollow and never really evolves outside of this. He is extremely selfless, which is not a bad character trait to have, as that is what makes Luffy from One Piece one of my favourite protagonist, but he
                  doesn't feel real... His emotions and presentation of his character always feels flat to me, like he is written specifically to be a run of the mill protagonist. His convictions/reasonings are weak, and the situations he is put in don't make him feel like he is rising from the ashes to strike back after facing a terrible situation, but instead if anything doesn't go his way, he switches with Sakuna and the job is done. While in later episodes we see him stronger than ever, standing on his own, this feels extremely forced as well, with not much real progression to how he actually got to that state. He just starts doing unbelievable well, even compared to some of the strongest characters in the show. Compare this to Gon from Hunter x Hunter, who sometimes can't face a situation due to his weakness, leading to a strong character build up, but Yuuji on the other hand just happens to get strong, similar to Ichigo from Bleach, that or let him inner power do the work... Kinda like Ichigo from Bleach...
The side characters aren't all that interesting, and mainly come across as a cast as ""cool"" characters the mangaka thought up, who simply are written to be cool, and that's their character. At least to some degree the main side characters have a level of depth to them, with Nobara  having a flashback episode. Not that it's that interesting to begin with, her resolve being that she wanted to live a wealthy life instead of the one she had.
I just can't relate to these characters, and after watching the second season of Mob Psycho, I find myself even more distant from these characters, when I can relate and care about a kid and a con man more than a whole cast of characters... 
Despite this obviously negative tone, the action is good, and the animation is amazing. If you like power scaling battle manga, you will enjoy this, but if you are looking for something deeper, you'd be hardpressed to find it here.",7,XXXSUCC

                Jujutsu Kaisen is the kind of anime that manages to continually baffle me, not in regard to its production or overall quality, but the insane popularity it achieved in such a short time despite being an aggressively unremarkable and derivative series. Just like its predecessor Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Jujutsu Kaisen forced itself into the limelight thanks to a high-profile anime adaptation. The difference between the two is while Demon Slayer exploded in popularity when its first season was already halfway completed, Jujutsu Kaisen received significant amounts of shilling from social media and anime sites before it even released; the hype in the weeks
                  leading up to and after the anime’s release felt manufactured more than anything else. Shonen Jump is searching for their next flagship series nearly always so it makes sense they would try and push hard on whatever has the best chance of getting big. It makes more than enough sense since most of their long-running series ended within the last 4 to 5 years and Demon Slayer, one of their most historic successes, finished its run last year. 
Let’s start with what I enjoy about Jujutsu Kaisen as an anime. I think the production values are fantastic and it’s clear why it became the standout in an overall middling anime season, where the only other contender was another season of fucking Haikyuu. Mappa was clearly favoring this over Attack on Titan Season 4; JJK has far better color grading, use of lighting, art direction, sound design and choreography that elevates the source material to great effect. They even toned down the infamous ""piss filter"" they kept using for Attack on Titan. I went back and compared some of the fights from the anime to their respective fights in the manga, and it’s clear the anime outperforms them in the same way that Demon Slayer did, despite the occasional moment of off-model animation. The aspect I heavily dislike about many of the fights is that, despite the fact that they are indeed animated well, the characters seem to constantly be skating around the battlefield, causing some moments to look goofy instead of serious. 
The soundtrack is full of bangers and atmospheric pieces that always fit whichever scene they’re played over. It had multiple different composers as well, so none of the songs feel too much alike. Jujutsu Kaisen also handles power systems in a way I find satisfactory; it doesn’t feel convoluted and chained down by an elaborate set of rules and restrictions. The major fights are brutal and entertaining; the main cast doesn’t have plot armor and both sides get brutalized in nearly every battle, which is refreshing. The attitude this series has in relation to violence and gore reminds me of an 80’s OVA, something you hardly ever see these days and especially in a modern Shonen Jump series.
Jujutsu Kaisen’s biggest flaw is its characters. In the first season nearly the entire protagonist and antagonist group is already introduced, with several more characters and factions being referenced and namedropped. Not a whole lot of them especially stand out; you can tell Gege Akutami is borrowing heavily from his main inspirations like Bleach and Yu Yu Hakusho, but they write their characters in a way that makes them so goddamn boring to watch by themselves. 
Yuji Itadori, the protagonist, is a teenager who gets a demon inside of him through unfortunate circumstances and is forced to become a sorcerer so the sorcerers can figure out how to kill him. Yuji is insanely bland for a main character; he’s frustratingly uninteresting compared to the rest of the cast and almost always has the same facial expression in every scene. He gets over the death of his grandpa in the first episode within a few minutes because the producers probably didn’t want him showing any sort of emotion for more than a quarter of the episode. 
The nail in the coffin is Yuji’s special ability; punching things really hard and having an overpowered demon inside of him like Naruto. Every other student at the school has more interesting powers than Yuji, even the talking Panda who is near and dear to my heart. The only time Yuji has a personality is when he interacts with Megumi and Nobara (Sasuke and Sakura but not total garbage), but even they have more interesting powers, agency and character arcs than Yuji.
It’s easy to see that Yuji is the Round Spongebob of shonen MCs. He’s meant to be as inoffensive and marketable as possible, someone the average zoomer can insert into. You can tell Gege wanted to pay homage to characters like Ichigo Kurosaki and Yusuke Urameshi, but they’re either incapable of doing so or doesn’t want to give their character the same edge they had. They seems to love paying homage to Togashi’s works, considering he rips entire scenes from them; Yuji’s rage moment in Episode 12 is pretty much a direct “homage” (read: rip-off) of Gon’s infamous scene in Hunter x Hunter. It’s laughably unsubtle. 
Speaking of ripoffs, Gege’s biggest offense making no effort to hide the fact that they basically completely copied Kakashi from Naruto and inserted him into their own series as Satoru Gojo. He looks exactly like the former except instead of a mask over his face, it goes over his eyes. They also both have lightning powers. And while Kakashi was a more balanced character, Gojo makes every villain look like a complete joke. There’s almost no tension whenever he’s around because he can just bust out a new move and oneshot the enemy.
The episodes of Jujutsu Kaisen are just standard low-stakes ghost hunting. Think Bleach but more people dying horribly. We meet the main characters, later arcs are set-up and so forth. Around episode 9 the first major arc begins; nearly everyone in this arc is portrayed as braindead to an insulting degree, when it suddenly turns into a disjointed and horribly executed anti-bullying story. Junpei, a kid Yuji meets during an mission, is a victim of violent bullying from a gang of comically awful bullies, for…some reason; his cartoonishly stupid teacher and classmates see it happen and act like nothing is wrong with this. Also Junpei is portrayed as one of the stupidest people on the entire planet. He witnesses the main villain of the arc, Mahito, commit a triple homicide in front of him and immediately decides he’s a trustworthy fellow. It escalates to an actual magical school shooting which goes badly. 
The worst part of the arc is the ending; suddenly Junpei’s dumbass teacher feels remorse for being such a terrible excuse for a person, and his main bully gets away with a stern talking to instead of, you know, being expelled for beating the shit out of a younger student on a daily basis. What the fuck, Gege? This shit is insulting. The entire arc feels out of place, and barely touches on the real world issues it was centered around. As someone who was bullied frequently in middle school I felt it was insanely patronizing. Maybe Japan has a different approach to bullying in media but this all feels so pointlessly misanthropic and indecisive for no good reason.
The final major arc of the show is a tournament between two sorcerer schools. The rival school’s characters aren’t notable with the exception of Todo, who is the best character in the show. He’s a total Chad and every scene he’s in is entertaining. His teammates, on the other hand are quite boring. Two of them are meant to set up some contrived clan drama, and the other two could be replaced by cardboard cutouts. I rolled my eyes every time they had some sort of sad backstory whenever they were about to lose. The fight choreography is terrible and derivative during most of these potentially interesting matchups. For example; during a battle between a gun user and a close-range weapon user, the gun user manages to get a lucky shot in after hatching a complex plan, but the weapon user just catches the bullet in their hand and wins anyways. Any tension that was present in the previous 15 minutes of fighting instantly disappeared.
Jujutsu Kaisen is a mixed bag of concepts and archetypes from older, better series. The series is at its best when it deviates from the norm; trying new directions that most shonen series stay away from, even when it doesn’t stick the landing, but it borrows so heavily from other works it becomes impossible to overlook when the most hackneyed aspects are presented front and center. The attempts at humor are insufferably bad 99% of the time and undercut the admittedly refreshingly edgy tone. I can appreciate Gege for trying something new with formulaic tropes and cliches and adding in fun and inventive powers. There’s plenty of creative aspects to be explored, but the main aspects of the show are so boring and lifeless you’re better off just watching the fight scenes on youtube. It’s hard to care about two-thirds of the cast when the best development they get in 24 episodes are forced emotional moments via flashbacks. On a brighter note, many people have told me the manga is great. But that leaves the question of whether or not the anime can match it in quality.",5,jahver

                The beginning and the first half of Jujutsu Kaisen was very promising, emotionally attachable and exciting, the second half was predictable and boring. There was nothing special about the second half. They could have just cut the arc out of the storyline, but i also have doubts about the next arcs. There aren't any strong antagonist, no real competition. Good guys wins motto continues almost all the time. 
The rest of this comment contains spoilers.
Yoshino was the only exception. I wasn't expecting him to die and it might have been a great character development to Itadori. But his death was wasted. Itadori almost never ever
                  think about him again and we didn't get any emotional conflict whatsoever. After the end of the first season he was already forgotten.
The story lacks continuation. It changes like a bag flying in the wind. Sukuna is probably the only one who can really challenge them seriously but the story continues without him. He will probably be the final boss or something and until that point everything will be dull. 
There are great character design and animation. Jujutsu still has great potential. But it needs so much more emotional depth. Also i should point out that some of the philosophical thoughts characters discuss about are something i really appreciate.
5 is not a bad rating from my evaluation. It is probably more than this story deserves. I am not a hater. I just don't want to see it waste it's potential.",5,Bakasa

Like he didn't give shit about anything at the start and then his grandfather just said protet people and that's it , just like that it became his LIFE GOAL WTF?? I haven't seen something as half baked as this! His goal is to give people proper death yet he couldn't save
                  so many of his companions and give them their proper death! Lol it just doesn't make sense ! Even if he save some of them people will always face undeserved and untimed death! Look at the amount if murders and accidents take olace in this modern era (JJK IS SET IN OUR MODERN ERA) ! So many people die bcoz of these accidents and murders and natural disasters so nobody can save all of them from dying from nature's actions so THE MC'S GOAL DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

One of the most overhyped and overrated shows i have ever seen in my life ! Doesn't deserve any of its praise ! Highly disappointed",1,Kash_020322

                This is my very first review and below I will explain why I think Jujutsu Kaisen is a Masterpiece (10 out of 10!) for me but in a more likely situation, it's a highly rated 9. As for making a distinction between the two I will clarify that Jujutsu Kaisen has really brought me back to a simpler time where I could just enjoy an anime. This is in no way a condemnation of Shonen as a genre, although my opinions on My Hero Academia might not make that clear, but rather as a result of growing up. Being an adult is realizing that the
                  stories and shows of the past are mostly carried by some form of attachment; I refuse to use nostalgia here because I honestly don't want to go back to the way things were in 2007 for media. This can be easily seen, as is the case in most media, by trend of people realizing that parts of Harry Potter were pretty problematic. However I don't want you, the reader, to miss the forest for the trees and think that this is going to be review critical of tropes and genre trappings like I am some sort of culture critic. No, instead I want you to know that Jujutsu Kaisen is a show for me that allows me to get hyped for Shonen again and if this is the place that Shonen is heading I am all the more here for it. Jujutsu Kaisen as a series kicks ass and I am here for it but it also doesn't follow, at all times if any, lazy tropes that makes my adult brain despise the genre and the show. I can safely compare it to something like Hunter x Hunter for me in regards to an interesting take on the genre and the tropes within it. While comparing it to Hunter x Hunter may ring as alarm bells to some people, why yes I am a manga reader as well, it is without a doubt, in my mind, a fair comparison as a fan of both series but with one series seeing constant content; ships really do problematic in anime huh? And as such I would like to say that without a doubt I would personally rate this anime as a 10 for me just because of how much I got out of it. In that regards this is truly the first anime that made me feel like I was an anime fan and that I would engage in discussion and or discourse around the series. However I can also confidentially say that this anime isn't for everyone and as such I can't in good faith say it is a masterpiece. For clarity, it could have it's flaws and does have flaws which I don't really feel like a masterpiece would have. Maybe this will change at some point and I will be more confident in saying it's a 10 to random strangers on the Internet and for me it's a 10 but I think making that there is a distinction between looking at the series through the lens of just enjoying the series with confidence and being critical to nitpicking the series itself. With that said I can confidently rate the series as Great and must watch for any enjoyer of Shonen or Anime alike as will be described below, explaining my ratings.
Story 8/10: Likely influenced by virtue of reading the manga and knowing what will happen, Jujutsu Kaisen has a very good story with excellent world building and a great power system. However it does suffer a bit from patchy arcs which can make the pacing seem somewhat erratic.At times it does struggle to bring everything to the same level, certain events in the story are no way equal to each other, however I can ignore that and also rationalize it as not everything needs to be high stakes or every battle after the first needs to bigger badder and have more cost. As such I can overlook what someone else might call flaws however I cannot say that story as it is right now is beyond a 8 as it currently is lacking some grandiose that I might expect from something different. At last I don't let that hold down that the Story and Writing of Jujutsu Kaisen is a 8.
Art/Sound 10/10: I just think MAPPA hit it out of the park with both of these things giving me amazing fights, bangers on bangers for both OPs and EDs, which also just scream what Jujutsu Kaisen is about, bringing home the themes and feelings for me. Also Jujutsu Scrolls, yes there are things after the ED so please don't forget to watch until the end, are absolute delights and I will never think that Jujutsu Scroll positively affects the world. Otherwise there's not much to say but please MAPPA bring this same heat to Chainsawman and also come back for more work on Jujustu Kaisen in order to avoid a One-Punch Season 2 catastrophe.  
Character 9/10: What can I saw but Gojo. He single-handedly bumps this up to a 9 and I expect to see this become a 10 at some point. While I could never understate my love for Gojo as he is my ideal man in so many ways and just exudes the exaggerated swagger of a man who knows he is the best, most if not all these characters are deserving of love in some form or another. While the style of the characters might be a bit lacking due to school uniforms, their personalities are surely not and without pulling any punches Jujutsu Kaisen has probably one of the most likeable casts of characters I have ever seen with mostly decent writing for them. Yuji is an outstanding protagonist and Nobara is just such a likeable character who plays so well with so many characters and is an absolute delight. Maki and Panda are also great characters in the supporting cast with other characters like Todo and Nanami being fan favourites for good reasons. It's honestly hard not to get attached to these characters in some ways and it is very exciting to see their growth through this series and I am more than rooting for them! As for coming back down to things overall Jujutsu Kaisen has very good character writing which without a doubt is pushed to a 9 when I think about how insanely nuanced they are and that Gojo can now be in my life forever and always. 
Enjoyment 10/10: I think I made a good case for why I would personally rank this show as a 10 for me in the intro so without any more delay I will go into my closing thoughts in the Overall Rankings.
Overall 9.5/10 or personally, 10/10: Jujutsu Kaisen just hits so many marks for me and so hard, maybe down the line, I will be more critical of the show or the ending may flop and leave a bad taste in my mouth but for right now I am just happy and seeing this show air every week makes me happy. So what I can say is that Jujutsu Kaisen has had an overwhelming positive impact on me and I always cherish this series for that. However while those are my thoughts and feelings, I recognize they aren't universal and there are some issues with the story and characters, a hard maybe on the characters since the only thing in my mind that could be lacking for them is some more style in their designs to make them feel personal, but even with that I cannot ever rank this series lower than a 9 for right now so overall I would say that Jujutsu Kaisen is a 9.5/10 and I highly recommend you watch it if you like anime. 
I hope this review has been helpful in some way and I hope to be able to review it's next season so positively too. So thank you for reading this and enjoy, Jujutsu Kaisen.",10,PhoenixLord05

                Story: 10
The anime follows the manga faithfully, and anyone who has read the manga knows that the story flows very smoothly. Everything makes sense. It is not like one of those ""unique"" animes that have intentionally (or unintentionally) make it difficult to follow what is happening or what happened in between certain events. The story itself is very encapsulating since it is one of those ones where all my friends and I were always dying to watch the next episode after the ending of the current one. The story and what was to unfold got me so curious that I ended up catching up on
                  the manga in just a week (I read slowly, don't judge me T^T).
Art: 10
I honestly don't understand how people could give this any less than a 10 watching any fight scenes of the show or even just the first episode. The drawings are dark, beautiful, and crisp for the main part of the episodes while the change in atmosphere and softer lines during the Juju Strolls (filler shorts after the ED) can change the mood immediately. All my friends (nonshounen watchers) and I think the fight scenes were much more fun/hype to watch than Demon Slayer and KnY's fights were beautiful.
Sound: 10
All the voice actors are so good at their job (ROPPONGI noises). The sound effects for the combat is sick. Most of all... ALL THE OPENINGS AND ENDINGS SLAP!
Character: 10
There are girls in shounen that are actually useful. There are badass almost but not really middle aged men with cool glasses. And then there is the axolotl (Wooper/Mudkip looking fish) boy of an MC. Oh and then there is the cool man with tattoos that everyone on TikTok seems to be replicating. The character designs and personalities are so full of life that it is hard to forget any of them.
Enjoyment: 10
It is the first anime that all my friends and I have been able to watch and enjoy at the same time. It is fun constantly bringing new people into the anime and hearing their top 3 characters. Not a single one of my friends that have started it have been disappointed. Personally, it entered my top animes because of the enjoyment I've had watching it with my friends (and rewatching on my own for the fight/comedy scenes).
Overall: 10
TL;DR: Enticing story that has you wanting more after the completion of each episode. Beautiful fight scenes and comedic moments that'll make everyone go crazy ahhhh go stupid. The openings and endings should be enough of a reason to watch the show. The characters have made everyone I know add a new favorite character onto their MAL list. My friends and I hyped for every Friday for the newest Jujutsu Kaisen episode. The manga's fight scenes were superb and the anime just expanded on it even further. This show is definitely worth giving a watch and gets a 10 from me.",10,Jimindrew

                Ridiculously overrated it’s nothing more than a bad version of bleach mixed with naruto in a highschool and city location. The only good things are the animation and opening 1 the story is less than mediocre along with the character’s and setting. please just avoid it and it’s unwarranted hype just watch Naruto and bleach you get more content more enjoyment and much better characters. If you want something unique that will hold your attention this isn’t the place to find it. If you’re specifically looking for a new gen dark shonen then watch or read chainsaw man it’s much better

                I honestly don't understand how people can give this a low rating - my brain just doesn't process some of the criticism it's getting. Perhaps Jujutsu Kaisen IS like other shounen animes in its plot, frankly, I don't agree, but I also don't claim to have watched every shounen anime on the market so perhaps there's a running trend I've missed. Yes, Gojo does resemble Kakashi a lot, and I like that, and yes, there are some familiar themes that I've seen pop up elsewhere in shows somewhere or another. But if you look for similarities, you're always going to find them.
Plot: It's practically perfect,
                  it's interesting and follows a similar dynamic to Mob 100 in the way it presents paranormal activity. It's a little dark, but I don't particularly mind. The smaller villains pose as very genuine threats unless you attach yourself to smaller characters, but I've always had a niche for characters like Kakashi or Levi who are way too overpowered.
Characters: I really love Itadori, the main character. Characters with perfect souls and super genuine personalities tend to annoy me as they can be loud and irritable, kind of like Deku, but Itadori is very self-aware and holds a special place in my heart. The only thing I'd say is that I feel we don't really get enough screen time for Megumi, but frankly, that's just because he's my favourite character so I'm biased. 
Atmosphere and Setting (World Building): Overall, very consistent and always obeys to rules of the world that have been set out. I like that the high schoolers still behave like high schoolers in the settings thrown at them, but the makers of the show do still manage to instil a tone of seriousness when necessary which has been my problem with a lot of animes in the past.",9,DrStreetRat

                What a disappointment.
Jujutsu Kaisen could've been such a fantastic show, but instead it's just your run-of-the-mill, although pretty enjoyable shonen. There's nothing about this show that we haven't seen millions of times before. 
The characters are at first glance pretty interesting, but once they've been introduced (which is usually done by a lazily written memory that appears mid-fight out of nowhere and which fails to give them any meaningful depth) and once I've seen their fighting skills, I couldn't care less about them. In fact I wish for some of them to just fucking die already so that I don't have to bear their generic
                  tropes any longer, the MC included. His pink hair doesn't stop him from being the most bare-bones shonen hero. 
The plot is interesting at times, but the problem is that it's EXTREMELY rushed. There's just very little space for the characters to develop. It's all happening so unnaturally fast, which is part of why most of the characters are just not interesting. They don't have room to grow on you. They're just puppets meant to deliver a good looking fight. 
There's a slight horror element to this show which could've been used brilliantly to make the world and the whole concept of curses scary and intimidating, but it seems like the director cares little about that. What a shame.
Speaking of fights, they are visually very appealing, and depending on the situation can make the atmosphere really intense. Part of the appeal is seeing what type of fighting abilities are out there too. The characters have very diverse strengths (which makes it so much more unfortunate that the MC has nothing more to offer than flashy kicks and fists) which is ultimately, besides the brilliant animation, what makes the fights enjoyable to watch. 
However, the fights lose their intensity as the story progresses because you quickly realize just how little they matter. There's rarely any serious life-or-death situation, or generally just any situation where the characters risk something valuable, which makes the fights less meaningful. Those fights (which there's an abundance of) are not treated as a means for character growth. They're just there to show what the characters are capable of.
I sincerely hope that this is all just a necessary syndrome of wanting to impress investors and viewers with stunning fights and funny scenes (or anything that can be excused by finance and management), because I do think that the series has potential. Though if the show continues at this pace, it will quickly fall from a 7 to below 5 for me. I'm willing to give it the benefit of a doubt but for what it's worth, this show is by no means the great shonen that everyone seems to consider. The rating of 8.8 just tells me that you don't need to be a good writer to appeal to masses of impressionable teens. But then again it's a shonen, so maybe I should just lower my expectations.",6,dg_t0des

                I usually don't write Reviews on this site but Jujutsu Kaisen is so damn overyhped i had to do it now. 
 Sword Art Online, Attack on Titan, the List goes on but every so often in a while a show gets released which maybe not be exactly Bad but is definitely super overrated. ( I mean Aot S3 Part 2 Ranked place 2 on MAL are u for real ?  ) 
Jujutsu Kaisen is the most overrated show of 2020 and like one of the most overrated shows EVER ( score 33 on MAL xd ). Anyone who watched a couple of long
                  running shounen anime ( like one piece, hxh, yu yu hakusho, bleach ... ) [or even shorter shounens like FMA B, my hero academia ] and still says this show is "" sO uNiQuE aNd DiFfErEnt "" is clearly not right in the head. Like legit only absolute newbies to anime could rate this anime a 8 or higher im not tryna hatin on those ppl for enjoying the show but please don't rate a show like this that high if you didn't even see other shounens- becuz you can't have a legit opinion if you dont have any other fighting-series to compare :D
Even tho i could end this review right here I'll go on and go into further detail now :
Story ( 3/ 10 )
Average Story at best, nothing special. Like legit the story does absolutely nothing different than other contenders in this genre. 
The Powerscaling is actually half decent but still not good. (Very Good powerscalings in shows for example are : HxH and One Piece). 
The Worldbuilding is also bad. 
Art  ( 8 / 10 ) 
The Art and Animation is actually very good, nothing to complain here. 
Sound  ( 7 / 10 ) 
The Soundtrack is also quite nice, not amazing but its definitely better then average ( the opening 2 is a banger )  
Characters ( 4 / 10 ) 
boring , unoriginal , 1 dimensional characters. we have the typical shounen trio with 2 boys + 1 girl and their op sensei .  If I only had to rate the Trio ( Yuuji, Nobara and Megumi ) It would be a 3/10 or maybe even 2/10 cuz they are boring af. 
There are some interesting side characters however that are very cool and unique like for example the Panda or Toudou Aoi ( that guys amazin ) who carry the rating to a 4/10. 
Enjoyment ( 3/ 10 ) 
Im not gonna lie watching Gojou stomp some Ppl with epic animation and Ost was kinda fun but thats about it. The show is super boring to watch especially after you see this high rating ( 33 ) and you expect to be blown away .  If this anime wouldn't be so damn overrated i might have enjoyed it more but everyone kept telling me how good of a show it is and after like 2-3 episodes i could already tell that it isn't the case. 
I've rated the anime a 6/10 . The only reason I didn't give it a 5 or maybe even 4 was the good animation , the soundtrack and some cool side characters.",6,Kyouuka
40748,"
                The series started slowly but promisingly. From around episodes 7-8 onwards it went real intense and on another level. The animation quality and background score are getting better. This series has the potential to reach the heights of One Piece , Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and other classic masterpiece shounens.  However right now its not there yet. The great arcs are yet to have arrive. Once it arrives it would be in that category. However, its still a 10 out of 10 anime for regardless. The latest episode was brilliant and we couldn't feel time passing by. 
Almost all audiences could give this series a
                  try despite gore scenes here and there. Its definitely worth the watch and stuff.",10,PixelKiddo

the fact that people call this anime a masterpiece is beyond me . jujtsu kaisen is one of the most overrated anime i have ever watched.
so bear with me because i have a lot to say .
story : 5
lacks originality ,copies a lot from naruto. 
weak and confusing power system 
characters : 5
we have yuji our generic protagonist who has no motive other than saving people . his character is bland and has no depth .other shounen protagonists go through struggle to  DEVELOP and get srtong .but yuji is different. it takes only few month for him to be strong enough to
                  not need sukunas help aside from healing him  . you know he only watched couple of horror movies and a bunch of toys kept punching him . this is basically  how he got strong . i also disliked how the author tries to force the friendship between megumi, yuji and nobara ,when they only just met . 
nobara is a fine character . what i dislike about her is her backstory and her country girl in a city persona  . the author tried to make her quirky which is annoying 
megumi is uninteresting like the rest of the cast but i have high hopes for his development .
overall iam not a fan of the trio
sukuna was the only interesting character on the show and very well written

                I don't understand why everyone is ranting and raving about this. I'm thoroughly indifferent from how generic it is. About the only point I can give to it is that it's violent and has blood which isn't very common for anime. However like alot of anime that does have blood it decides to go overboard and focus heavily on it as a focal point for alot of the visuals. I haven't been this disappointed by an anime that's been largely ""acclaimed"" by the masses since... Darling in the Franxx actually. But at least that show settled at a reasonable score and didn't maintain the praise
                  throughout the whole series.
It just has so many issues. It's not an excuse to say that it isn't taking itself seriously either. It IS taking itself seriously. People have just suspended their disbelief thinking ""surely they knew this was dumb"" when it continuously does dumb things while seeding obvious effort into the cracks to it's own detriment. I think the visuals are the sole factor holding this show up because it sure isn't much of anything else.",6,Jebus_Kreist
40748,"
                The beginning of the show was really cool, the characters were introduced in in a really engaging way, animation and music was sick, and especially the horror aspect as we’re introduced to the monsters was cool too, but starts to fall off later. slight spoilers (and the bad parts of the show) past this point.
It was cool to see the power differences in the beginning of the show like how the special grade that was just at another level compared to the 3 kids, but then all that gets tossed out the window. Yuji does some off screen training and then suddenly gets super OP
                  with a new power that gets introduced as he’s using it. We don’t get any sense of hard work like in Demon Slayer’s training scenes, and I sure as f don’t care about the Black flash, something that is supposed to be super hard to master, but Yuji suddenly masters it as we get introduced to it, which makes it really hard to care about, and all the power levels get thrown out of wack at this point. There is no longer any looming fear of a great threat(like the super scary presence Frieza had in DBZ) cause apparently Yuji is strong enough to fight the special grade now and surpasses everybody, taking away the horror aspect of new special grade monsters appearing cause he’s already good enough to fight the top dogs. Also, please quote me on this: the show is gonna throw away the horror aspect in later seasons. It’s hard to keep things scary; you have to keep introducing new things and I don’t think they’re gonna do that seeing as they’re relying on school fights(with no horror) to fill episodes.
Other bad parts of the show that makes it hard to care about details of the show: I cared about the cool animals the fugi guy had and didn't want them to die, but apparently he gets rewarded for it cause it just buffs his other pets one dies. Also the panda fight where he just keeps introducing new parts of him makes feel like deus ex machina, but maybe it’s just to introduce the character so this can be excusable if he ends up being important. Overall, the writer isn’t willing to hurt his characters so he gives them outs like fugi’s animals buffing his others when one dies and yuji’s healing with sukuna and introducing stuff mid fight like the black flash takes away weight of earlier details.
The music is pretty cool and animations look litty though.",6,stebing

                I think I expected more from shounen in this day and age and was thoroughly disappointed with Jujutsu Kaisen. I was looking forward to a dark horror shounen but at this point I'm only continuing it as I'm this far in. 
I think I really dislike Jujutsu Kaisen due to the characters and writing. Over the 20 episodes I've watched, it feels centred around the question ""what is your type of girl?"" to the point it even becomes a plot device to progress battles and friendships. That's right, instead of an epic dark plot with epic character stories, you've got this. No joke this question
                  is asked so many times and I could deal with it once or twice but it's getting old fast. This starts from literally the second episode, in which Itadori needs to introduce himself so he professes his love for the type of woman he likes. I cringed so hard. Who does that and how is that important? It's almost like there's no depth to the MC so this is what was scripted for his self introduction. Oh wait, there is no depth to the MC. And don't even get me started with Toudou and his interactions with everyone. He is the biggest driver for the ""super important"" question. At this point Toudou could be yeeted into space and I'd be ok with it. 
Honestly it felt like the show needed to constantly remind the audience that the male characters are 100% straight: Oh, just so you don't forget, here's the ""super important"" question again and again! It honestly just felt creepy and was just not necessary and feels really out of date. You've got strong female characters like Maki and it feels like the author is intentionally degrading her along with every other female character in the series by centring around this question. Maki is actually the only character I like. She genuinely feels strong but like most shounen, she is booted out of the main battle. Nobara is fine but there's even issues with the dialogue here and there surrounding some of the women. There's dialogue on how women must be pretty and then dialogue on how they can be pretty BUT strong. I have no problem if a female character's complex and character development is on this topic but DO IT WELL. Don't give me badly written lines from badly written characters during a battle! Overall Jujutsu Kaisen tries to create strong female characters but shoots itself in the foot with it's own writing, and succeeds in creating a creepy gross vibe due to the oh so important main question.
In terms of the MC and character development, the MC just comes across as weird and there's no real danger to him due to Sukuna inhabiting him so battles involving him become automatically less tense the more the series continues. In the very beginning, his only close relative dies and his reactions were abysmal. He was up and stabbing monsters within minutes and then felt compelled to follow his grandfather's last words. Like I get it that the MC and team are meant to be kind of unhinged because they deal with horrible things but there's no character development that's done decently enough to make me believe why any of the characters are how they are. Mai was given some to explain her situation and terrible personality but it wasn't convincing enough nor done well enough as her personality is far too bratty and stabby for me to care about her as a character currently.
Overall if you enjoy watching stereotypical shounen characters run around the playground with pocket knives and teachers who don't care and would rather see them stab each other, Jujutsu Kaisen might just fill that spot for you.
The music is fine and the art is decent, particularly the openings/endings.",4,callulu

                ""The next great Shonen!"" is a phrase that gets tossed around a lot. Seemingly every year, multiple times in fact, we hear that phrase, saying that this new show is the real deal and will finally fill the void that the likes of Naruto, Bleach, or HunterxHunter left behind. Now it's another discussion entirely if those shows are actually great Shonen or not, but once again we find ourselves with another series that many claim to be the next big thing. And while it may be the next popular thing, does that popularity actually translate to quality as well? Most of the time, it does
                  not.
Adapted from the manga of the same name, Jujutsu Kaisen follows the high school student Yuuji Itadori who has the keen ability to see curses. The world is full of curses from people who have passed on with regrets, and these curses stick around and can range from being minor annoyances on regular people's lives to being deadly ones who kill those who are unlucky enough to cross its path. To defend against these curses, Jujutsu Sorcerers use their abilities to exorcise them from the world.
Jujutsu Kaisen goes for a much darker theme more than your average Shonen. With grotesque looking curses and people dying left and right, it certainly stands out from the crowd in that respect. The story itself however, is as run of the mill as it is forgettable. Yuuji becomes a vessel for the strongest curse in the world, making him one big target in the world of Jujutsu Sorcery. 
But like most Shounen, it focuses more on its characters and the challenges they must overcome to push the story forward. Unfortunately, if your characters aren't likable or compelling, that can be a major problem. Jujutsu starts off fairly strong for the first number of episodes, however as more characters are introduced and as the story goes on, the quality worsens.
Yuuji is your cookie cutter protagonist who just happens to have a massive amount of power for some reason. We're never told why, we just have to roll with it. He has two teammates, Megumi and Nobara. Megumi is the seasoned student Sorcerer who's been taught since a young age, and Nobara who has some experience of her own, but came from the countryside with not nearly as much experience in the big city.
Megumi is far and away the best character in the series. He's not cocky or full of himself, he struggles with things making him believable and likable, and many tell him he has incredible potential, but he needs to learn to not hinder himself with self-doubt. Nobara on the other hand is confident, but not all that likable. Being so sure of herself makes her a little hard to bear at times.
We get introduced to more characters and most are akin to brick walls, with little personality or likable traits. The other major issue would be how strong they all are. Usually characters need to have weaknesses, so they can have room to grow and improve. However, our group of characters have virtually none of that. Enemies are decimated, leaving no tension in any of the fights.  In fact, I would say JJK has some of the most well animated boring fights I've ever seen. When the enemy poses no threat, how can the viewer be invested in what's going on? The sheer power and teamwork that is displayed in some fights feel almost unjustified, with no training or strategizing shown on screen prior.
The antagonists are just as boring as the protagonists. With zero charisma and posing little threat to the heroes, they fail to serve their purposes making them practically worthless. Usually villains have tricks up their sleeves or moves that the protagonist can't immediately counter which gives the fight weight and tension. But in the second half of the show, all of that is thrown out of the window. I don't think I ever worried about any of the heroes losing or even dying once, because I knew that their unparalleled strength and teamwork that seemingly came from nowhere would defeat any foe. It made for a very boring watch.
But I have to give credit where its due, Jujutsu Kaisen is simply one of the best looking animated series in years. Studio MAPPA has solidified themselves as action giants in the industry. Fights are well choreographed, well shot, and well directed. Linework is clean, and during fights, dynamic and interesting. This is a very visually appealing show. The art style is a little on the plain side, but there are a few nice designs here and there. I would say the gnarly designs of the curses are what steal the show.
Now while the fights are visually appealing to watch, I find that there are actually too many action centric episodes. Going back to characters for a moment, Jusutsu needs to slow down and let the characters interact with one another. It helps make them more likable, more human, and let's us better understand who they are and what they fight for. It also helps improve character dynamic and chemistry. But it just doesn't take the proper time to do that, which only adds to its character issues.
Audio wise I don't think there's much to write home about, the music used some traditional Japanese instruments which was a nice touch, but there wasn't a singular track that ever jumped out at me. The voice work was well done, with the vocals from Gojo and Nobara being stand outs.
Jujutsu also tries to subvert common Shonen tropes which I can appreciate. Clichés such as explaining abilities or techniques mid battle, or villains not needing to live in a dark evil lair.
The genre of Shonen can be harsh and unforgiving, with it being arguably the most popular and easily accessible kind of genre out there for anime. Meaning series in that genre can either be incredible successes or massive failures. Jujutsu Kaisen is no doubt popular, but that popularity does not translate to quality. When you have overpowered and unlikable characters, boring and tensionless fights, and a story that's easy to forget; you get a mediocre Shonen at best. If Jujutsu just slowed down, gave itself a chance to breath, and expanded on its 1 dimensional characters, you could have yourself a pretty well made Shonen that tries to buck the cliched trends set by its predecessors.
Until then, Jujutsu Kaisen has to face its demons, or in this case curses, before it has the right to be in the conversation of the ""next great Shonen.""",6,takkun_

                **edit: I have not read the manga, so this is purely my review of jujutsu kaisen the anime and I could be entirely off base.
Jujutsu Kaisen excels at a lot - I'll give it that - but it does fall short. Overall I'd give this anime a 7. And before all you Jujutsu Kaisen fans come for my jugular, let me tell you why. 
Art - 8 Mappa delivers here for sure. The animation is crisp, the fight scenes are clean, original, and engaging, and the setting is also note worthy. Plus, they've animated down to the fine details with hair, leaves, etc and they
                  also use unique angles. The art is spot on. 
Sound - 7 We all know that you can hype up to the intro of this show. It's catchy. And while the soundtrack isn't particularly noteworthy throughout the show it's not distracting either. 
Character - 8 The characters are all likable and unique, although they could've been fleshed out more (in my personal opinion). However, where the characters do shine is in their dynamic with one another. Sakuna and Yuugi have a great dynamic, as well as Gojo and Nanami. 
But here's my issue. THERES NO STORY. NONE.  Jujutsu Kaisen feels like a show with a ton of different, unfinished arcs and none of them have been concluded. Now the show is still on going and for awhile I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I just figured that it was going to be the type of show where the there a lot of different threads and eventually they connect into a big aha! moment for the audience, but I have a feeling that the story peetered out a long time ago. I would rate the story overall a 3. 
With that said, I've really enjoyed the show. The pace of the show has a lot of momentum and combined with the art and characters it distracts you from the story entirely. If you're looking for something fun and entertaining but still have high expectations for anime, you'll enjoy Jujutsu Kaisen. Just don't expect a ground breaking story. Naruto did better.",7,mknz12

                Anime is dead, isn't it?
for some reason i didn't want to accept that but anime is truly dead
This anime is just style, it starts with a cliffhanger, (oh no the MC is in danger!), then continues with MC having a dark side or a monster side that can suddenly take over, then we have Kakashi, the Overpowered Sensei who needs the weak MC and he is the relaxed guy in the show, then we have cringe attempts at comedy, someone says something dumb, MC shows a poker face, then we have demons or evil spirit or some boring villains like that, then we have visually
                  pleasing fight scenes, then we have power of friendship and flashbacks
this is generic and boring as fuck, this anime is suspiciously similar to demon slayer in terms of story telling structures
Whenever I think about the Main Character I can’t help but think what exactly is his motivation? What? to “help others” because his dying grandpa said so? such a lazy piece of shit of a motivation this is, we are not shown why he respects his grandfather’s wish at all
“I want to help people”, WHY? You can’t just give the protagonist an IRON WILL to help humanity out of thin air, remember he is just an average student
The story develops in such a pathetic way, he eats a finger and immediately his body moves fast and changes color and he yells I’m gonna rape every children around and then he gains his consciousness back randomly and asks what happened like an idiot, the story never delves into the character’s mental state, there is no meaningful situation, no moral dilemma, it’s just a bad zombie trying to kill us and we have to take a rotten finger from him so we can eat it! Nothing else to be said tbh
What about the Villian? Is he any good? no, empty shell who is just evil, he is strong but what’s the use? There is always the Get Out Of The Jail “secret power” free card which comes to the rescue of the main character, it’s so repetitive at this point and MORALLY reprehensible that writers are still using this kind of tricks, this doesn’t make me as angry, as it makes me sad",1,AgentBishop

                So here i'm making my first review@_@
I want to make it clear where is JJK's (rise and fall) my perspetive  CONTAINS SPOILER
The recap on the story mainly about the beginning of JJk.: 
The anime introduce us to the main protagonist Itadori we soon find out about his closest family member Wasuke Itadori's grandfather, as well of his death wish.
Wasuke's death wish is that his grandson use his powers well that we don't know anything about, and to be nice to others and help the weaker.
JJk didn't lived with the opportunity to tell us about Wasuke and Itadori's relationship so we don't feel too much
                  about Itadori's loss.
Notable that this death wish stays with our MC and sets him on a journey, well this is only notable because this is the only thing that moved this anime forward to become what it is now,
and my head just hurts to think how many stupid thing it introduced.
contains spoiler
Jjk focused too hard to make characters lovable from the start and not giving them anything new or challenges going on the story to fight for. They have to fight for there lifes but no personal score to beat.
Nobody having challanges throughout the story, Itadori able to do the unthinkable (breaking the goal post) (control Sukuna) i know there was that one-time thing where he can't get back the control but that was just for the drama.
And we viewers reacted to itadori's comeback the same as Nobara and Megumi. ohh u still alive good then.
Its clear that they want to make this anime enjoyable by adding those caracters that are similar to well known or loved caracters
But they are focusing on this too much that its hurts the story.  what story?
This anime want to be serious, but when it's really needs to be its just can't deliver, just like konosuba thats why all of the jokes hit because it's not serious, fights don't stir the water.
I hope its understandable what i want to tell.
Story 1 score 
This animes biggest flaw in my eyes is that it can't commit it self, steer its self in to battle but no meaningful outcome just setting up minor climaxes. Meaning there will be a big or whatever size fight where every move dosen't make sense and not going to change anything at the end. – (feels like the writer had to figure out something p.d.q. (pretty damn quick) or copy something to make this anime what it think it is but its not.
–  (dosen't feel itself)  – the climaxes that thosen't add to anithing –(look an anime donsn't have to have story climaxes everywhere to be enjoyable, it's just speaks itself that's it's a lackluster)
The uncertainty in the show showed itself clearly at the last fights, where Itadori and Aoi fights whit Hanami, once they ran out of ideas and can't copy anithing else they just cut the fight off by call in Gojou and vaporize the guy, but he will be back there is no fight where anybody lost their lives before its not gonna change.
Art 8 score 
Drawing is really good! The studio outdid them themselves.
For my likeing too dark themed, but the strong/vibrant colors counters it well.
Sound 8   
music is good
voices are good 
Well this is not why i'm here.
Although the sound and art is top quality it can't make this anime more than what it is.
Character 2
Copied characters with a little bit a twist in them so its not Kakashi with face mask against covid, its Gojou with eye protection?
They tryed to get in some character development whit Megumi by Sukuna telling him that he has more in him, but they forgot to actually do it after they closed the climax.
Enjoyable (recycled characters) but at the end lack of character development. Even the character skills are copied Miwa's ""skill"" is basically Unglaus Brain's skill from overlord. And just as effecrive XD
Enjoyment 5
At the start it was good, but after that its down hill 
Why whould the fights get my interest when i know something absurd gonna happen and not gonna affect anyithing.
+I guess good jokes, funny and awkward moments 
Overall:4,8 i guess but i don' think good sound and good art make this better when the story lacking what it takes.",6,peter707
40748,"
                Went into this anime with somewhat high expectations. Saw a 8.79 score, thought it was going to be some good shit. But honestly ended up mostly disappointed. 
Some spoilers, as a warning. It's basically your generic Shounen with the Airhead + Glaring Edgelord + Extreme Personality Girl combo that you see in many other Shounen, most commonly Naruto, with a spice of morbidity. So the protagonist, the airhead, has a demon inside him that unleashes when he's in trouble (haven't heard that one before). The main enemy is curses (something like demons), but suddenly of course, they have to fight amongst themselves in a competition
                  with other students, that ends up being interrupted (another very generic development), where they introduce dramatic stories about each character during the fights. Lots of conspiracy too. I don't know why modern anime force conspiracy so much. Anyway, If you've seen a good amount of anime, you can tell this strategy has been used millions of times. I don't mind generic Shounen, but if it's going to be generic it would have to be executed very well at the very least.
But in its favour, overall the fights were cool and the jokes weren't that bad either. I didn't hate it. Toudou was a pretty funny character. But don't expect anything amazing out of it, especially if you've seen enough Shounen already. If you really have nothing else to watch, then I say give this a try.",6,imsomeone
40748,"
                Jujutsu Kaisen isn't a great show. It's poorly directed with predictable tropes and extremely repetitive fights.
TLDR note: I do not hate this show, imo if you like this show more than other shounen that's just prefference. I also had high expectations which affected my enjoyment.
This is a good show to watch if you're new to anime, or if you're a sucker for shounen.
Skip it if you only want great shounen.
Stuff: If I wanted to watch characters go on and on about how they're so much stronger than each other, and get bombarded with ridiculous in-house refferences for power I'd re-watch Bleach or Dragon Ball. In
                  those series the power-levels get time to develop so they infer respect when someone achieves something.
Here they just rush past any character building whatsoever.
Black Flash could have been a really cool move, if it had a buildup, instead they explain it IN A FLASHBACK the first time we see it and then proceed to throw out a multiple of them as a measure of power. Compare this to Goku training to master the Kamehameha or Naruto training for many episodes to learn the first Rasengan.
In contrast this all feels pissweak since there's literally no buildup, they just like to show STRONG characters being STRONG. It's thinly veiled cardboard pandering.
Jujutsu Kaisen is basic as fuck shounen. There's nothing it does better than other shows, and plenty of things it does worse. That said, it is basic shounen, if you like shounen and you don't have too high expectations it might be enjoyable.
Itadori as a character was pretty enjoyable, unfortuneatly he was the only enjoyable character.",6,Kirvan
40748,"
                Let's start with the good:
- Art is okay.
- Animation was pretty good! The ep 2 fight Gojo vs Sukuna was nicely animated.
Okay, now let's talk about the actual story.
What is Yuji's motivation? At the beginning, he swallows Sukuna's finger in order to save himself. This feels a bit like the start of Bleach (not a good sign). After that, what does he do? He decides to go on a quest to defeat Sukuna. Except this is not his own decision, but a decision forced upon him by Gojo - either he goes on the quest, or he will be executed. This is problematic.
To put it
                  simply, the MC has no agency. What is the MC's motivation? His grandfather told him to ""help other people""? That is such a lame excuse of a motivation that he got called out on it in the anime. He then tried to justify his decision with ""I'm the only one who can suppress Sukuna"". But again, that rings hollow to me. 
A real person does not completely change his life goals after just meeting a guy. That's the difference between Naruto and Bleach. Naruto always wanted to be a hokage ever since he was a little kid. That's a believable motivation. By contrast, what is Ichigo's motivation? ""I want to protect my friends""? 
Jujutsu Kaisen reminds me of Bleach in that respect. The MC does not have a believable motivation. It's just: this thing happened, now I'm going to devote my life to beating this bad guy that I've never heard of before up to this point. That's not how real people work.
Let's talk about Yuji. At the start of this anime, his grandpa is on his death bed and wants to tell Yuji something important about his parents. Yuji is like ""nope, don't want to hear it"". Then his grandpa dies and Yuji starts crying. Literally WTF. If you love your grandpa so much then maybe pay attention to what he's telling you when he's on his death bed. 
There is a lot of ""tell, don't show"" in this anime. We are supposed to believe that Yuji had a strong bond with his grandpa, and yet we don't see any evidence of this, other than Yuji crying and visiting his grandpa's grave. 
This is one instance where flashbacks actually would have helped. What was their relationship like when Yuji's grandpa was alive? What did they do together? What kind of stuff did they talk about? What did his grandpa do for him? And so on and so forth. None of this is explored, which makes the relationship feel hollow. We are TOLD that their bond was very strong, but this was never SHOWN in the anime. 
Let's compare Jujutsu Kaisen with Chainsaw Man. The MC from Chainsaw Man, Denji, had a convincing motivation based on his entire life experiences. Denji grew up in poverty and was forced to sell an eye, a kidney, and a testicle in order to pay his debts. In the very first chapter, he enthusiastically swallows a cigarette for money. 
These little details serve to flesh out a character and make them believable. If we are to believe that Yuji wants to ""help people"", it would help if the anime showed him doing things like helping the old lady cross the street. Even little things like that help to flesh out a character. In Jujutsu Kaisen there is none of that. Again, we are TOLD that he wants to ""help people"", but we are not SHOWN this. The only purpose of this motivation seems to be to be used as a ""power up"" during fight scenes.
The characters in jujutsu kaisen do not have distinct personalities. What do I mean by that? 
In Chainsaw Man, consider 3 of the main characters: Denji, Aki, and Power. Power has a fundamentally different personality to Denji and Aki. This was shown the very first time she was introduced, where she tried to murder Denji in order to save her cat. She literally does not give two shits about humans. She is a pathological liar. She's practically a psychopath. Aki is the very opposite. Those are very distinct characters and personalities. Given any situation, you can easily predict that Power would act in a selfish self-serving way, whilst Aki would act in a way that would be consistent with his hatred for all devils.
Now we look at the characters in Jujutsu Kaisen. How is Yuki differentiated from Fushiguro or Kugisaki? What even are the personality traits that define these 3 characters? Sure, we can see that Kugisaki speaks in a rude way, but, come up with a situation and try to imagine how the characters might act in that situation. I find it very hard to predict any differences in the ways that the characters would act. 
The first mission in Chainsaw Man revealed the character of Power, and how different she is from Denji. In contrast, what did the first two missions in Jujutsu Kaisen reveal about the characters of Yuji, Fushiguro, or Kugisaki? Really, I can't think of anything. 
First mission in Jujutsu Kaisen. Kugisaki was confronted by a hostage situation. It doesn't seem like she had an answer to it. Yuji saved the day by coming through the wall, but that mission did not reveal any fundamental differences between the two characters.
Second mission in Jujutsu Kaisen. A super powerful curse comes out. Fushiguro and Kugisaki are useless. Again, Yuji saves the day by telling them to get out and then unleashes Sukuna. 
Let's talk about Sukuna. The way he's used in the show is very similar to how Ichigo uses his Hollow or Naruto uses his Kyuubi. In the second mission, when faced with an overwhelming enemy, his team mates are useless and Yuji has to unleash Sukuna to save the day. This is just like the many situations in Naruto where Naruto's team mates are useless and Naruto has to unleash Kyuubi in order to save the day. It's essentially a get-out-of-jail free card. Why bother coming up with clever, creative solutions when you can just rely on your secret hidden power? 
Man, there are so many problems with the story but I feel like I've written enough already. The animation was good, I'll give it that.",2,skynet5c

                This is objectively one of the best animes ever made. Regardless of bias or preferences it is still an absolute masterpiece of a show that also has a nice runtime without having any filler at all. The art along with the way it's presented creates the best looking anime ever. And I mean ever. The entire anime is eye candy.
The story is pretty good and intriguing even while the story isn't even a main selling point of the show. The characters are unique and actually make sense. The main character doesn't do any tropes of being surprised and being totally flabbergasted by something, he just
                  accepts it and deals with it, which I personally froth over finally being able to see someone not pull a slasher film character and act completely stupid in the middle of combat. The art as well is just... Calling it a marvel to behold would be an insult to understatements. Not just the mouth watering but also the way it is presented is so gorgeous it's almost better than losing your virginity (so take this as a substitute since we know a majority of you won't be experiencing the latter). The camera angles and the movements and the way it follows the scenes almost feels like a live-action movie, but in a way is also better, along with amazing fight scenes that rival the likes of the top shounens of all time, it's just an utter masterpiece that I cannot get enough of

                The story at first seems to have an interesting beginning, i mean, a good student in sports luckily obtains the mystical powers of a human-like demon that enhances his abilities, turning him into someone superhuman.
The development of the characters and the objective of the protagonist is beautiful, it leaves a positive and encouraging message for the people of this society. The only bad thing is that it really is not a shonen that contributes something new, in fact it is even generic, and i am not saying it to throw free hate, it is the truth, and there is nothing wrong with this. It's like
                  Kimetsu no yaiba, having components that, although they characterize it by themselves, don't really add anything groundbreaking, but hey, it's just as enjoyable. I think that jujutsu kaisen is a normal anime to see it one day that you want to enjoy something, i see no need to boast about it, because that is something that i have also seen that ruined in part the anime, the stupid fandom, but thats something inherent to my opinion about this work.",6,Ferxas

                It's too generic
I doubt any shounen can ever be original, they can try but it'd probably be really hard trign to get new readers to read ur work. But like seriously it's not that hard being original. You just risk people not liking you story. People developed a connection with shounen tropes and always want to see those tropes repeated but the same people also want something new. You can't have both. Jujutsu Kaisen is a classic example of this. Everything it does has already been done before.

You get my point, this show is hella generic but Eh.... that's perfectly fine, Slice of life anime is one of my favorite genres and the shows in that genre just repeat shit all the time, I still love watching it. But the thing is Jujutsu Kaisen fans try to make the show seem smarter than other shows in the same genre or demographic, It's literally just like every other shounen with good animation and a slice of edginess... 
Well, Even though it is generic I do think this show does some things really well, Demon inside boy is an overused trope, but my man Sukuna is definitely one of my favorites, and even though domain expansions are territories and Fate reality marbles, They are cool af, because they are still relatively new and haven't been overused yet. The Soundtrack for this show is definitely good. Albeit not as good to be in my top 20 soundtracks but it's up there. The animation is good but not great I guess. It's sorta inconsistent, but the moments they do get it right, It's amazing.
That's where my praises end. This show is kinda Boring. Look, being generic doesn't mean you can be boring too, The characters that get introduced into the plot, and become a part of the story without actually having a proper introductions, this makes it sort of hard to build tension since no one cares about the characters in the first place. I sorta applaud older shounens for introducing important characters episodically because it helped ground their character with the viewer and the characters that didn't get introduced, were background characters until they were necessary, In Jujutsu Kaisen you could say that's the case but Whereas those other shounens left out some characters out of the action, and flesh out the ones in the action, Jujutsu Kaisen, introduces Characters then leaves all of them alone without development, Introduces more characters then leaves the ones it had just introduced. It happens throughout the whole show. You could say the Exchange event fleshed out characters but that basic characterization that happened in the arc was what we were supposed to get when we met the characters. It's not like it was proper characterization either, most of it happened with a backstory, Todou and Hanami are the only characters that feel like characters to me now, It's not like the backstories were bad either. I just didn't care for the character and their backstory was supposed to get me to, when it didn't
A backstory should be given to the characters after we already know what they are like, adding a back story when there is no character foundation is like Throwing the cement without bricks on.  It just makes the story seem sort of cheap. Sure it might ""Get gooder"" later on, but if it's not good from the beginning it isn't a masterpiece, Like people are saying it is.
ITADORI
My God Yuji Itadori by far one of the worst protagonists ever, He is boring. Why? Because,  in an attempt for a realistic protagonist, Itadori just became a normal person but more boring, he just wants to help people... He has no proper goals in life, and The main reason for a story happening is conflict, this story rarely has narrative conflict, i.e. a character wants something but the antagonist also wants the same thing and they clash... Itadori doesn't have a goal like that.
Itadori is just coasting in the world he is in, If he wasn't the main protagonist, I doubt anything would change the story......... the characters are automatically buddy buddy, the conflict we get later on is Itadori trying to kill Mahito but since I didn't care for Itadori in the beginning, I found it hard to care for his One conflict. He is basically Deku without the crying. Both of them are bland but at least Deku in season 1 had a strong goal and tenacity towards achieving it I was hooked into the show. (Can't say the same anymore but whatever) He has One rage scene that's a rip off the chimera ant arc and Doesn't take the good things about it. The reason Gon's anger was scary was because the whole show he seemed nice and I had grown attached to him, His anger came from a when close friend of his who had been a father figure to him got murdered. 
With Itadori, His anger came from a dude who he had met 30 seconds ago and we had known Itadori for less than 12 episodes making it hard to care for such an important event. The show might be going for ""what happens when a good guy starts to become broken as more of his friends die and he becomes dark"" approach but since the event that tipped the Dominoes wasn't founded properly, the rest of his outbursts seem angsty and broody to me, making me hate him even more. His personality is also inconsistent, one moment he's a childlike character, I liked him like this, The next he's a loud shounen protagonist, the next he's angry and angsty, the next he's chill and acts like he's the mature teenager. He also gets random boosts of power by pep talking himself. LOL
THE WOMEN
The JJK fans made it a statement that Jujutsu Kaisen has the best women in shounen but that's obviously a stretched lie to make the show seem better which they do a lot. 
I don't know where people got the idea that to have a good female character, They must be masculine, and they must be able to fight. The women in Dragon Ball are not even as powerful as the men in the show but they offer so much to the show, Chichi adds conflict when she doesn't want her son to do dangerous shit and just wants to be a good mother, Bulma is literally the reason Dragon ball Z is even remotely interesting, her character is so well defined and well written it bounces of Goku's creating a great dynamic that's fun to watch, 18 has a miserly personality and wants to have as much money as she can, she seems sort of cold hearted but she loves her husband and child. Erza from Fairy tail is extremely feminine yet remains one of the strongest characters in the show, she isn't heartless either she is a well defined character with flaws and actual motivation. None of the women in Jujutsu Kaisen can scratch the characters I just mentioned, Even the women in Black clover. Black clover has a variety of women, The ones who embrace their femininity, the ones who embrace their power, and of course the powerful ones, the closer we get to Black clover characters the more flaws we see.
In Jujutsu Kaisen the female characters don't seem to have any flaws, Mai is the only who actually seems like she has some sort of flawed personality, I don't like her, but I appreciate her character, Nobara seems like a Sakura 2.0, the only difference she has from Sakura is that she doesn't have a crush on the broody dude, I heard she gets better but from what I've seen, she ain't it. I actually rally like Utahime and The blue haired money lover girl. surface level wise. People need to stop acting like having female characters in the show, that automatically makes it good, I'd rather watch a show without main female characters if they aren't going to be written as well as the men in the show, hunter x Hunter doesn't have any main female characters but the ones in the show are so well written and trample all of the Jujutsu Kaisen female characters no questions asked. and they don't even need backstories to do it.
Random stuff that I noticed
Jujutsu Kaisen introduces characters that seem important, doesn't develop them well then forgets about them, I.e Ijichi, The principal, Nanami, Ino-Kun who's never seen again after he's introduced, the bare bones characters make it extremely hard to care about the plot. Which I don't think has actually started... It's definitely not a show to find Sukuna's fingers, none of the main characters are that keen on finding them
The pacing is weird, It went really fast up until episode 5 then it becomes extremely slow, things that should take a longer time to resolve, get resolved in a episode.  Then the arc that follows is really slowwwww....This might be in part of me not liking Junpei and his edgy ass, I swear everything he says is supposed to sound smart but I come out of the scenes he's in thinking, who the hell talks like this? Like Danmm this man acting as if he knows the whole world. The thing is his character isn't even that consistent either, In one moment he's preaching at me, the next he's a goody goody, the next moment he's all shy, the next moment he's determined. I don't like him. I'd like to clarify: Junpei's personality being inconsistent, does not mean he's more fleshed out and realistic btw. 
Then the're the shameless exposition, In episode 6 Gojou explains his entire character in a place that's the least memorable, where no one asks,but the characters just say shit. Nanami explaining his powers to Itadori felt out of place, I know when they explain their powers they become stronger, Look, the curse he was fighting was a low level curse and he didn't need to get a boost. I have a question that wan't answered in the anime, If they speak their powers and they get stronger, does the strength the technique the last forever or does the boost go away and thy'd have to explain it when there is a new enemy? Idk Then there's the scene Miwa explains how her the school system works to Maki who already knows how it works. When the characters explain stuff to Itadori it's fine because he obviously doesn't know but when they start explaining stuff to each other u just have to wonder if they even had conversations before the plot started.
I heard from Broken Ronin's video that in the manga there is narration so the exposition  explains the stuff instead of just bringing characters that aren't in the conversation into it for the sake of exposition.
All these problems are't as prevalent in the manga because you choose how fast you stay in a scene, and you won't even have time to think about these things, with the anime, you have a lot of time that just feels like characters talking... All they do is talk Ughhhhhhh I kinda get why the anime is popular, The manga readers who already like the story don't mind the pacing as much because they have already seen it. Most of the anime viewers are taken in by the hype of the Shibuya arc, If you don't think too much when watching this show, it's pretty easy to enjoy but when you start noticing inconsistencies... yhhhh
The power system is In between hard and soft. It had rules but they aren't defined ofc. Most of my Friends who like this show say they had to watch videos explaining the power system.... so it's not that simple.
if you think the power system is clear answer these questions
Who can use magic? How is magic used? What is the source? What are the limitations/rules? Is there a cost to using magic? How does magic fit into your world?
I can only answer one of the questions with confidence, The source of the power is cursed energy, but then again questions pop up like can d=you be strong only from cursed energy? Doesn't that mean if you're negative, the more powerful you are? And cursed spirits are pure Negative energy doesn't that make them pretty undef-eatable? 
I thought this show was just ok, a 7/10, and I told the internet that, they clearly didn't take it well and started harassing me, For a 7/10 show(at the time)  I can't- anyways, I legit re-watched this show 4 times and I hated it the more I watched. Sukuna being the only interesting thing ofc he has his own motivations and does not conform  to the plot. I have a feeling he's fit nicely in Hunter X Hunter.  AND for people saying Sukuna got clowned by Gojou are wrong, In episode 1 Sukuna was only 1 finger strong, wait till he gets his fingers back ahahahah

                There is a time when we have to say goodbye to something or someone that we love so much and with a lot of passion and this moment hurts, but what can we do? 
It happens and the only thing left is to deal with it.
Jujutsu Kaisen is finishing and I'm already missing this anime.
Is an anime that made me happy and very excited for a new episode every single week and when a new episode was released, was the best part of my day.
It's a rare gem of the shounen genre.
It has been a while since a felt this way about an anime.
I am
                  being serious when I say that this anime is unique and really surprising.
But okay, let's talk about it with more details.
Story 8/10:
The story itself is not the best part or the most impressive but it's still very good.
A world that curses, espirits and evil creatures exists and not many people can see, talk or interact with them and the few persons that can are training to learn how to face and defeat those threats is kinda interesting. 
The things they do, how they organize their groups and how they affect all the things around them are fascinating. From the beginning we see a lot of problematic situations envolving people that are being attacked, manipulated or possessed by the curses and all of those cases are with reasons behind it that are more than just the typical ""We are evil for the sake of it"".
I like to see the motivations and the objetives that leaved them to that point so far.
It is clear that the story will get much better in the coming seasons with more key elements and important points being presented. But for now it is very good.
There are so many things that happen in this 1° season of Jujutsu Kaisen that I think is so fucking amazing, but I will not mention any of them because this review is spoiler free, but the opening made a great job tricking us...Nice on, MAPPA! ;)
Characters 10/10:
I really like all of the characters, every one of them are so well constructed, with good motivations, an interesting personality and with their own charisma.
Itadori is a great protagonist because instead of just being the MC that wants to be the best or the biggest one in something or someone that wants to be recognized he is just trying to save and protect as many people as possible, do good things in his life while he can and that's it. A realistic person.
Megumi is a good friend that always is there to help and be supportive and is also someone trustful. He is a guy who's trying to improve in his fighting skills but has some issues to resolve. Nobaru is a strong and determined girl who likes to fight but without losing her feminine style. 
Also friendly and a nice person, but gets angry really fast sometimes. She's great.
Gojou Satoru is a badass. The overpowered one that everbody loves and respect.
The perfect example of how to write an insanely powerful character. Simple as that.
There so many charismatic and interesting characters that I could talk about them all day long with no problem whatsoever. An anime full of extraordinary examples.
Before I forget I have to say that Jujutsu is one of the best at developing and highlighting female characters and make them really important and useful in creatives and productive ways and does not use the girls only for fanservice or to just makes them secondary at best like many other shounens.
In Naruto for instance the girls there only exist to be the wife of the guys and that is pretty much it. Not in Jujutsu Kaisen, they are badass, they are indepedent, they are what they want to be and that is trully impressive and beautiful.
Art - Animation 10/10:
The animation is always pretty damn good, everything looks so solid and smooth.
The fight scenes are very well choreographed with a clean and decent art style.
I think in this aspect is truly a masterpiece. Absolutely flawless. Maximum quality.
Sound 9/10:
Both openings are fantastic with catchy song themes.
Kakai Kitan is the opening that makes you want to watch all the anime by itself.
Lost in Paradise is the most swaggy and satisfatory ending song in anime ever.
Is so fucking good that goes beyond my comprehension. Almost unbelievable.
The 2° ending is nice, but it's nothing compared with the previous one.
VA's are all great and combine perfectly well with the characters.
(Sukuna's voice is the GOAT)
The only thing that I would like to critize more is the OST's.
I think they could do a better mix and also a more remarkable soundtrack.
Only for the OST's and the second ending song that I give here a 9 of 10.
Enjoyment 10/10:
I love this anime so much that I can't express in words this feeling.
Not a single episode that I didn't like it or thought that could be better.
Not a single time that I wasn't amazed and extremely happy watching it.
The day a new episode of Jujutsu Kaisen was released was the best day.
Became my new favorite anime so fast that all my friends were surprised.
I would recommend it for anyone. Period. Thank you God for JJK. I needed it. :D
Overall 10/10:
Jujutsu Kaisen is a masterpiece. And that's just my opinion. 
Of course it is not a perfect anime because there is no such thing like that.
But it's so well crafted, truly refreshing, interesting, impressive and exciting that is impossible to not say that is one of the best anime shounen that I've ever seen. 
Has potencial to be even greater on the next years and I am glad to have watched while it was airing this 1° season. 
Deserve all the hype and the credits that is receiving.
Thanks for reading and give an upvote with you liked my review. o/",10,MatheusMariz

                Jujutsu Kaisen is about...
A spiky-haired orphan with a heart of gold (who is not Naruto Uzumaki),
Who ends up possessed with the world's most dangerous spirit inside of him (Who is not Kurama),
And ends up being brought into a fighting school (that is not the Leaf Academy),
Where the leadership is torn between using his abilities or killing him, because of the threat he poses. (Which is not what the Leaf Elders feared).He ends up being partnered with a sullen, dark-haired emo guy (Who is not Sasuke Uchiha),
A strong-willed, short haired girl with a bad attitude (Who is not Sakura Haruno),
and mentored by a blindfolded, white-haired, cool mentor, (Who is not Kakashi Hatake).  
These four form a team (That is not Team 7),
and go out on missions to exorcise demons and fight sorcerer students from other schools in events that decide their rankings (That are not Chunin Exams).
The Spiky-haired orphan struggles with the demon inside of him (Which is not like the early relationship between Naruto and Kurama.) 
And because of this, he can't rely too much on his unstable cursed energy (Which is not Chakra),
but manages to get by with his fighting skills (Which is not Taijutsu.).
Ultimately he learns to harness his chak--I mean, cursed energy and becomes a super dope fighter.
He even has an attack that turns his hands blue, like on the cover...(and no, that's not Rasengan). 
He must simultaneously fight, while being protected from villains who want to steal his powerful spirit. (Which is not what Naruto had to endure.)
The primary villain being a psycho skilled in body manipulation that loves to experiment on people. (Who is not Orochimaru.)
I'm giving this clear Naruto rip-off a hard time. But, seriously? It's one of the best animes out right now. It's every bit as good as Demon Slayer. Not quite as good as Vinland Saga, but it's up there. It's right in the mix with some of the promising gems of the next generation of anime.  
Yes, Jujutsu Kaisen lifts A LOT of themes and ideas from Naruto, but if you can pull it off and actually make a better anime than the one you're ripping off, then who can really complain? Because this anime is actually better than Naruto. And I really liked Naruto, ridiculous amounts of terrible filler aside.  While it is a Naruto clone, it actually improves on the formula in several ways from characters to the atmosphere.   
First: Nobara Kugisaki. I love her. I really, really love her.  I love her as much as I hated Sakura Haruno. So that's a lot of love.  She's funny, she's insane, she strong, she's everything I love in a female character.  One of my favorite parts of the anime was the very last episode with her fight on the bridge with Itadori.  She's so awesome. I want more Nobara screen time in future seasons.  She is a true savage.  She's like if you mixed Revy from Black Lagoon with a high school girl.  She's dope and one of my new favorite characters. A HUGE benefit this anime has over Naruto is her repore with Itadori.  The main reason I hated Sakura is that she was such a witch towards Naruto, who was such a likable MC.  Nobara, while sometimes mean to Itadori, is more like a partner in crime with him. They act goofy together, fight well together, and care for each other early on.  They make a great team. It makes watching them interact more enjoyable than it was watching Naruto and Sakura.
Second: Gojou Satoru. My second favorite character in the anime.  He may look like Kakashi, but he's nothing like him.  That's probably one of the biggest differences between this anime and Naruto, Gojou is more like Goku than Kakashi as a character.  He's just insanely OP. To the point where the villains have to literally gameplan everything around him not being there because it's game over when he is.  I see why there's a question of who would win between him and Saitama from OPM. (My money would be on Gojo. Saitama literally couldn't touch him.)  In spite of this, he's a complete goofball and funny as hell. But, you can tell he's truly intelligent and crafty.  So much so, I wouldn't be surprised if he turned out to be a villain down the line.  They don't make it any secret that he's hostile towards the current leaf village leadership and he's plotting something.   
Third: The Fights.  My goodness, the fights in this anime are flawless.  I don't know if they set out with the intended goal of being ""King of tag-team fighting"", but if they did, it's mission accomplished.  Every fight, EVERY single fight in this anime is good to great. And they even know to keep the fights between lesser characters shorter so you enjoy them more. (Nothing is worse than a 2 episode fight between characters you don't care about.).  But, while every fight is good, the tag team fighting is absolutely amazing.  And there's a lot of it.  The choreography is some of the best I've seen when they do that. Especially when Itadori is involved.  Itadori and Nanami vs. Mahito, Itadori and Toudou vs. Hanami, and Itadori and Nobara vs. the Cursed brothers at the end of the anime, man those fights were top notch.  The animation style of this anime is absolutely perfect.  I found myself running back fights again and again.  I also did that with Naruto, like with Rock Lee vs. Gaara and Sasuke vs. Naruto at the battle of Final Valley (Still an all-time great battle.) But, these fights were even better. I'm pretty sure if this anime goes on as long as Naruto, it will notch a few all-time legendary fights among anime fans. 
Fourth: The Severity.  This is a shounen anime, but it's also very bloody and it takes no prisoners.  The creators have set an early tone that ""Heroes can't save everyone"", ""No one has clean hands"" and ""Not every story has a happy ending."".  I think that's probably going to set the stage for some heartbreaking permanent deaths in the future. (Please don't kill Nobara off...please.).  But, this anime is aimed more at young adults than kids, and that just automatically makes any anime better. (Sorry, kids.).
Fifth: The Animation Style. I mentioned it before, but the animation style is fantastic.  Fight movements are so fluid and nothing is cheaply animated.  No trashy 3D or mailed-in, low-budget animation sequences.  Everything was top-notch, from character designs to movements, backgrounds, it was fantastic. The little skits at the end were low-budget, but that was by design. 
I literally have zero complaints about this anime.  Except there could be more Nobara. Yes, I am shamelessly stanning for Nobara. She's right up there with Kagura from Gintama and Balalaika from Black Lagoon as one of my favorite females of all time. (SLIGHT SPOILER) Any chick that will drive nails through her own wrists and slaughter your brother with a smile on her face is alright in my book. Push that nutcase to the brink of death again in Season 2. It brings out the best in her.  
Can't wait for season 2 and more of her and Gojou. (Oh, and Itadori, too. I like him. Not as much as Nobara and Gojou, but he's a good MC.). This is a very popular anime, so I probably don't have to tell you to watch it, you probably already have.  But, just in case?  Give it a watch.",10,Injenss
40748,"
                Gonna keep this nice and short. 
I believe that fans of the manga made a great disservice to the anime with promises of great storytelling. Sorry, but I don’t see that here. Yes, a couple of storylines about supporting characters did make an impression on me, but the story overall isn’t that deep, interesting, or interconnected. Moreover, sometimes I just plain forgot the motivations of the main character(s) and why certain things are happening, but that could be partly blamed on the team adapting original material. 
Overall opinion: Everything feels chaotic in execution and shallow under scrutiny, but it is somewhat entertaining. 
What did I
                  like the best? Animation. It is beautiful and not too generic. 
What did I like the least? Main characters. I didn’t have an emotional connection to any of them and that usually happens when they are made to move the plot forward, not the other way around.",7,Resident_Green

                This review will contain some spoilers, and i also want to say that this review will only be my personal experience  with this anime/manga and my opinion is entirely subjective, 
First of all jujutsu  kaisen, this anime at first seems like an interesting  snime when you see the hype and love around it which i personally dont have a problem  against, but mostly incorrect because of how much  flaws this anime gets it certainly was just... well a generic battle shonen with sorcery with some bleach  sauce  in it which doesnt seem bad at first but becomes damn
                  annoying  as it progresses 
Story : 3/10
While the story is bland and with 0 sense since ofc its a shonen to make pretty eyes, first comes highschool with the main character yuji itadori  whom is a great athlete  with inhuman strength, when he joined the occult club in his school  a curse came attacking him and his class mates then he does an action movie scene when he kicks it then he eats a finger for no reason as he gains a second personality living inside him to make the story  then the op character who's jokes are pretty  well meh defeats the monster and  brings itadori to execute him but instead makes him join the jujutsu  high to give him a naruto  trio blah blah blah, anywho to the point the story after that is just, heroes goes around, mission, kill curse, big curse arrives, beats the *** out of him, kill someone, repeat, the story lacks real progress  with villains that doesnt serve any purpose  other than being  insane and torturing cause its cool *cough cough mahito* and most importantly after 24 episodes i cant really  seem to find anything progressing after the first few episodes while at first  had a great potential  have been destroyed  by a generic weird wow cool plot that only serves  as a past time when you have nothing to do which well is about 80% of the anime which is sad but that's  how new gen suffers it 
Art: 8/10
While the animation is pretty great with nice fight scenes  shades and effects the only thing that bothers is the character designs  which makes them looks a bit wonky but still got some nice animation to help it
Sounds: 6-7/10 aint fan of the openings but the ending was pretty good about the ost its fine nothing more to add in that
Character: 2/10 worst aspect of jujutsu  kaisen  are the chatacters which are mostly dead with no real reason behind their existence  other than just because , lets talk about  yuji itadori he's  the main character of jujutsu kaisen whom like i said before had strength  and all but the problem  with him is that he's  not only an idiot but a ghost, he's  pretty much emotionless and feels like he's  some confused kid who got dragged in sorcery cuz ye, sukuna his other personality  after eating the finger was pretty interesting at  first then became some gag who does what he wants cuz ye then he saves megumi cause he got interest for no real reason, he's  a weird villain who just plays aroud waiting to get his 20 fingers to finally awaken but well  the probelm is that he's  like a version  of migi from parasyte except  he's  rarely  explored with no development  at all except being  the edgy side of yuji itadori to make fight  looks pretty even tho his matches are only one sided with poor screentime, after that we got the cake and my personal worst character of the show, ""gojo satoru"" He's  pretty much.... well nothing really  he's  just the ""ye im strong imma beat the cyclop eye look at my eyes girls im pretty"" while *spoilers* in the manga his flashback was interesting, at the  end he's  just  some pseudo psycho who wanna show strong with his eye bands that is just  there for design  and ofc his powers that makes exactly  no sense, ""infinite void"" is the strongest  domain in all of the series which leaves us thinking like, damn he's  strong  and all but the hell is his putpose ? Well he's  just there for comedy being a one punch man kakashi with little to no development, and goddamn his quotes are one on par with black  clover's lol, so for the 20k fans well enjoy your pretty boy but he's just a generic op unfunny  sensei, i can list alot of the character's  problems like the little screentime of megumi, and nobara and the cast that's  mostly some half assed drama with their siblings and a horny  besto friendo big guy who attacks  people for taste which pretty much describes  society alot so i give it one more point for that, and  ofc the villain which  are some version of team rocket who seemed  terrifying  to turn into some  sort of gag characters  who just are there to well let this show alive i guess.
Enjoyment : 5/10 while the jokes are corny and sometimes embarrassing  they are pretty  good sometimes, the fights are well animated and pretty hype even tho its predictable and wack, I'd  watch  this anime as a time waste more than anything so I'd  averagely  enjoy it so mid
Overall :4-5/10 while this anime had a huge potential with  all the hype around, it suffers even worse than kimetsu no yaiba to offer what we call an okay story which makes it sad cause  it shows how new gen is pretty much on downfall, if you want a  really  good story  with amazing characters it would be chainsaw  man even  tho i wont lie thay their concept is pretty similar except for a better execution form the hands of fujimoto
Hope you enjoyed  reading my bitter review and of course i respect some who  doesnt agree with me

                I am SO freaking tired of this show! It's just SO OVERHYPED I couldn't resist but to share my thoughts with this review. People keep saying that the manga is SOO good and stuff but I am reviewing the ANIME, not the manga, so those manga readers could shut up and accept the truth that the first season is nothing more than a 6!
Story - 5/10 
Tbh, just seems like a bleach ripoff at first but changes to something a little more original. But again, it's just like an average shonen with a demon-possessed main character along with his rival and friend and a girl
                  to complete the trio. Also, not to forget the playful overpowered sensei.
Art & Animation - 8/10
The art and is very close to the Manga and the animation by Mappa carried it for me.
Music - 8/10
There are some very good soundtracks used in the anime which do a pretty good job to support the environment. 
Overall - This show might be a good suggestion for someone who likes their shonen. 
Mappa did a pretty good job animating it. But the ratings this show has got are definitely not justified.",6,UsurperMilano
40748,"
                A mildly generic shounen that is very easy on the eyes. 
Both the writing and the plot are a bit lackluster & predictable, and the characters are kind of gormless, which all-in-all are probably symptoms of an over-saturated genre. Some of the curse and character design is plain, but it still has good production: good voice-acting, and the art/animation is creative and pretty darn good. Above all else, it's very fun to watch.
6/10 – I recommend this if you want to scratch an adventure/fantasy shounen itch or if you need to lick your wounds after some disappointing releases this year. It's just what the doctor
                  ordered.",6,darty_
40748,"
                This is another example of an anime that carried all the popularity due to the outstanding animation, I mean that is not bad, but far from another high-scored animes.
Story 4: This is a weak point, you can change Curses with Demons or jujusu-Shiki with Jutsu or skuna with nine-tailed fox and we get the same old story from a shounen. It's not bad, but it's not original.
Art 10: I love the hand-drawn curses and the fight sequences. All the is really good.
Sound 7: Amazing OP and ED. Insert songs are useless in my opinion and to be honest, the rest of the ost is just
                  normal.
Character 3: This starts really decent with a good characterization of the friends, the main villain of the arcs, and the teachers, but in the tournament, we get a bunch of annoying characters with cliche personalities. Lines like ""what kind of women do you like?"" are just outdated.
Enjoyment 5: it's nothing amazing, but is really entertaining due to the great production values.
Overall 5: In a nutshell is just a repetition of all shonen cliches of the 21 century, but with amazing animation.",5,Mario_Isla

                ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***
Jujutsu is another case of overrated anime, I was very motivated by a friend to watch and I confess that I didn't see anything very good, especially in terms of history.
Characters:
As an introductory season was meant to be, she simply introduces the characters, but in jujutsu neither the protagonist is developed, it is just another case of ""good boy"" who wants to help others without a well-worked reason. Nobara and Megumi also do not show much development, however Fushiguro is a character that has high expectations. Gojou has a lot of charisma, but it is easily noticeable that he is only strong
                  and handsome and therefore attracts a large number of fans. The only one that really attracted me was Junpei who died a creative death, he was betrayed by the curse that he himself generated.
Animation:
Certainly the only thing that really is masterpeace in jujutsu is the animation, the art style is really very attractive and the animation of the movements does not fail. The eyes are more attractive, but I really like the ink style used in the techniques, for example: Mugen.
Soundtrack:
I'll be fair here, it really isn't my style, I wouldn't hear any of the songs again. However, I cannot evaluate it for personal taste, in my opinion the soundtracks are really well made and should be perfect for those who enjoy this style, it helps a lot in the enjoyment.
Enjoyment:
I believe I got an ok entertainment, the fight scenes are good, the comicism is cool, but I really missed an innovation, it's all the same, fights and the discovery of powers. There are 3 episodes that really caught my attention in the anime, which were the 3 where Junpei is as main as itadori. Anyway, in general I think that enjoyment is a decent point of jujutsu, you can have a lot of fun.
History:
Now the part that most disappointed me. This first season in terms of history basically has nothing, it just shows a lot of strong people, the only new thing for jujutsu wizards is the curses that speak. How is it that an introductory season that hasn't gone into anything is still in the best ranked anime? Nobara has a cheap story in the manga, in the anime, he didn't even show it. Fusigoro is Toji's son, that's all, he didn't show it in the anime either. Itadori has the classic motivation of a protagonist, he is only a little better in personality. So far he has only fought and nothing else, his most exciting story is when he almost lost a fight. Of course, the action scenes are very eye-catching especially with an animation of this level, but jujutsu only has that for now.",6,Sanji-delas
40748,"
                Don't get me wrong, this anime may be good (especially for newcomers) - However, it's nothing for me. As someone who usually prefers seinen anime over shounen anime, I cannot recommend this anime. There are some other points I want to explain:
Jujutsu Kaisen isn't something new. It has many features of a typical Fighting-Shounen Anime: Some initially unimportant guy gains power from something special. As the series progresses, he gets stronger and stronger until he is the strongest person in the entire anime and can beat any opponent down. This, especially this, is NOT new and many other anime did the same thing (Naruto, One
                  Piece, Bleach, ...) - and in my opinion, this ""feature"" is just boring as hell. JJK isn't unique. 
Moreover, the figures in Jujutsu Kaisen are nothing special:
Yuji is a senseless imitation of Naruto and many other anime protagonists.
Megumi is like Sasuke. In German, he even has the same voice actor as Sasuke? Like wtf?
Nobara = Sakura, but much more useful.
And Gojo is just like Kakashi and looks a bit like Ken Kaneki (I mean, yes he's a cool dude - but at the end of the day, he’s just as much a copycat as most of the other characters).
Overall, the characters in JJK are not well written and they're not deep or something similiar.
The animations in JJK are good. However, animations aren't everything. There are a lot of anime with bad animations, but many of those anime are still better than JJK.
There are many other points I could explain, but I don't want to waste my time anymore for that. Remember, this is my personal opinion. If you liked the anime, fine – but I didn’t like it, so I won’t finish it anymore. Maybe I’m too old for such anime by now.",5,iiTzMemo
40748,"
                This Anime is very generic and it's similar to Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer). An organization of teenagers/students that hunt Demons with various magical skills and weapons. If you like that sort of thing then you will enjoy this but don't expect much.
This anime pretends to be deep and mysterious. Some episodes kinda remind me if Scooby Doo was an Anime mixed with Kimetsu no Yaiba then you get this. The problem is that while it tries to be deep is nothing more than a fighting Anime. The story starts a little interesting but it basically boils down to, collect the mcguffins, kill the demons.
                  This is not enough motivation or urgency for any character, there's no substance here.
The main character is not the cool guy you see in every poster of this Anime, it's actually a very generic Naruto clone with his own Demon inside him. (This is not a spoiler it's in the first episode and this anime has nothing to spoil anyways.) The main character is your typical, hyperactive, do-good, stupid but really strong character. He even makes references to other Anime's main attacks such as Naruto, DBZ, Bleach etc. but it's Ironic he's even lamer than all of those guys.
The teacher with the head bandana (These guys are kinda forgetable so I apologyze for not remembering any of their names even after 24 episodes) hes the best character in the series. He's really cool, kinda reminds me of Vash the Stampede. If he was the main character this Anime could go somewhere but they made the mistake of making this guy all powerful. So he can't be around much or there wouldn't be anything for any of the main characters to do. This is bad writting 101, that's why Vash the Stampede has a limitation of trying not to kill anyone and it's also a Comedy anime. In this most enemies are monsters that can get hand waived into non existence.
The other characters are not even worth mentioning. An ugly and annoying female character that kinda reminds me of Sakura from Naruto but she actually has some fighting skills and another Emo secondary character kinda like Sasuke (I think I'm starting to see a theme here) that can control shadows and it's apparently amazing but literally loses every fight he's in.
All in all, this anime has nothing to offer. If you have been watching anime for more than a couple of years and watched the usual Shonen Jump then this is more of the same. I heard some guy talk about how this Anime is the future but I completely forgot I saw it after a couple of days. The forest training was a bit interesting and the fights where ok, the art is good too, so it deserves at least a 5 or 6 /10",5,Zeriel00

                I have seen 18 episodes so far, and I will finish this. 
This anime has stellar visuals and some great fighting choreography. 
However, as far as battle shonen is concerned, this is still a fairy run-of-the-mill anime. It reminds me of Bleach x Naruto x Kimetsu no Yaiba. 
Take Naruto for example. Naruto, while infested with a lot of filler, is in a different ballpark to this anime. The creative world, rich lore, the amazing soundtracks, characters, the tragedies, the fighting style, etc., are one a different level in Naruto, and that is not even debatable.  
The two main boys in Jujutsu remind me
                  of Naruto and Sasuke... The girl, however, seems cooler than boring Sakura. 
This anime made a mistake of introducing the most OP character so early. It makes more sense to introduce the most broken characters later. Now, there is little to look forward to in terms of finding out how strong these characters are. The power levels are a bit all over the place. Imagine introducing a character like Madara, Whitebeard, Netero, etc., super early... No villain so far comes close.
The fighting style in this anime is fairly innovative, though nothing groundbreaking.
If it were not for the outstanding visuals, this anime would be even more generic. The story is not intricate at all, which is not bad per se... So far, there are no twists or mind-blowing revelations.
In battle shonen, Naruto has got by far the best fighting style (I will not mention DBZ, because that is a sacred nostalgia anime). One Piece, Bleach, Hunter x Hunter, etc., are all behind. Jujutsu is not that innovative. The bar has been set so high for battle shounen worlds. One only has to compare an Uchia like Madara or Itachi against any character in Jujutsu to see how creative Naruto really is out of pretty much all battle shonen with the exception of DBZ that changed the landscape.
This anime is above average. I prefer it  slightly over Kimetsu no Yaiba, but that doesn't mean much. Enjoy.",6,Schwarznight

I'm anime only for this and so far I haven't seen any special something on this anime.
I think I'm only watching this because of Gojo-sensei, nothing more.

                MAPPA, you've done it, you gave Jujutsu Kaisen the respect that it deserves. Before the anime was announced, the manga of Jujutsu Kaisen actually had a low score of 7.50 and I think it's because of the confusing fight scenes. Fortunately, the anime fixed that problem and now the manga of Jujutsu Kaisen has a score of 8.30.
This series is what I call a shounen done right. Everything that shounen has to offer has been put into this series and everything about it is so entertaining. Now without further ado, let's dive into my review on the amazing shounen series, Jujutsu Kaisen.

Story: 8/10
The story is cool and pretty straightforward. The pacing of the story is really solid and it's simple. I don't know what else to say tbh 
Art: 10/10
(I will be talking about the animation in this part) WHERE DO I EVEN BEGIN! We can obviously all agree that the animation is godly. The hype and the smooth movements makes me wanna jump out of my bed and punch random things in my room. Every fight scene is well animated and the hype aura that it gives makes this series so much better.
Characters: 9/10
The absolute adore the cast of characters in this series. The only thing that's stopping me from making it into a 10 is that there are a lot of characters that we don't get to know about in this season like Momo Nishimiya, Noritoshi Kamo, etc.

                To start it off this review may contain some small spoilers.  (writing review on December 2)
Jujutsu Kaisen is a newish anime that premiered in early October (2020). So far it has done very well and attracted many anime watchers and has gotten decent recognition. I've seen episodes 1-9 at the time of writing this, therefore this review will be on episodes 1-9. This review is personal preference and I am going to cover all 5 categories. If you don't want to read this whole review, then the overall summary is to watch it and give it a try. I am really enjoying this anime
                  and am on my seat for more episodes to come out. 
Story - 
So far the story is progressing fast. The pacing is good and I haven't gotten bored at any point yet. Starts off with the protagonist, Itadori, who already has some of supernatural strength and speed. He eats a has possession of a finger that is a special tier curse and ends of eating it, becoming a cursed object himself. The finger is one of twenty fingers that is the worse curse that has ever existed. He becomes 1/20 of the curse and ends of being taking in to become a Jujutsu Sorcerer at the Tokyo school. That's pretty much the first episode, it then develops into him training, gaining friends, and fighting in some pretty insane battles. That's the gist of it, supernatural thriller with comedy and tons of action. We are starting to see the Antagonists of the anime and I am super interested to see more of them. Rating 9 for story, most likely going to develop into a 10 when all 24 episodes have been released. 
Art - 
The art is incredible. I absolutely love this style of art. If you want to know want the art is like, just go watch the opening for JJS and you'll see how amazing this art is. The fight scenes are amazing as well. TOHO animation did a very good job and it makes the series easy to watch and pleasant to the eye from episode 1. See opening here --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bZVdTgXoY
Overall a 10 for the art. No complaints at all.
Sound - 
The sound is great. I recommend sub, dub is good (I've watched both) but the dubs main character Itadori just doesn't have the feelings and vibe the sub Itadori does. The music is great, one of the best anime opening songs I've heard in a while, Eve did a hell of a job (It is stuck in my head and I hum it all day long). The curses are creepy sounding, just as they should be. Fight scenes are amazing, as well as the background noise being very realistic. Rating a 9.5 for the sound, would do a ten if the dub for Itadori was better. Just watch sub and it's a 10 for sound.
Characters - 
I love the characters in this series. There's a god damn walking, talking kong-fu panda. I mean come on that's dope. I'll list the main characters and how I think of them.
Yuji Itadori -  His character is pretty well done. He is pretty feely and wants to save people and have a good death because his grandpa told him too. He is funny and stupid and kind of reminds me a bit of Saitama. He is a good MC/Protagonist for the series.
Satoru Gojo - This dude is amazing. He's insanely overpowered, but doesn't brag about it and is a kind funny teacher. He is badass, and when he fights Jogo... Gojo is my favorite character in the series and he is a large part of JJS.
Megumi Fushiguro - His abilities are sick. He makes animals from shadows. That's sick. This dude is chill and is one of my favorite characters in the series. He is pretty calm and introverted and it's pretty funny and cool. I really like this character.
Sukuna - The curse in Itadori. Super funny. Love this dude. Small spoiler ahead so skip if you don't want to read this. MINI SPOILER FYI --> It is absolutely hilarious when Sukuna and Itadori are discussing terms of coming back to life and they agree whoever wins in a fight wins the condition for their terms and Sukuna instantly just chops Itadori head off, it is one of my favorite scenes. I couldn't stop laughing.
Those are the chacters I wanted to metion, I didn't mention Nobara because she is lame and I don't like her that much. There are other good characters that I didn't mention, I just mentioned my favorites. I haven't seen much of the Antagonists so I can't give a rating on them yet. I give Characters a 10 due to me loving so many of them and me becoming attached to them in only a few episodes.
Enjoyment - 
I really enjoy this anime. I started off watching the 2 dubbed episodes for that are out right now, and since I couldn't wait I watched the subs for 3-9 and rewatched 1 and 2 subbed. That shows that I didn't even have the patience because it's that good. I never have gotten bored from this anime and I could've easily binged this no problem. I give Enjoyment a 10.
Overall/Summary:
I love this anime. I am confident it is going somewhere and is going to get even better. I cannot wait for more episodes to come out. The OP song is stuck in my head and I hum it non-stop, the characters are amazing and I am confident this is going to be the next big anime following in demon slayers footsteps. I love this series and it's already in my top 5, and that's only with 9 episodes upon watching it. This series has exceptional art and the story is progressing to the point where it is going to be one hell of a ride. I want to give this series a 10 for I believe it will become an absolute masterpiece, but due to this review being on only the 9 episodes of the series, I cannot rate the series with a 10. I therefore rate this series a 9. It is a great anime, and is going somewhere. It has adapted things the manga never could. I love this anime and it is just going to get better. Please, do yourself a favor and watch this anime.",9,-dirt

                Jujutsu Kaisen is a classic shounen well worth the hype. 
Story: 7/10
If I'm going to be honest, I originally avoided watching JJK because of the extreme hype surrounding it and only reluctantly picked it up after seeing tons and tons (AND TONS!) of fan art all over my social media feed. While the story is not the most original, what with JJK being very textbook shounen, there isn't anything wrong with that. Other than the predictability of the show, JJK has a pretty solid story that's enjoyable to watch. I haven't caught onto many plotholes, though that's not that much of a feat, considering there
                  are only 14 episodes out right now. 
Art: 10/10
As expected, MAPPA delivers with their captivating animation. The fight scenes are a thrill to watch. Though I'm not usually one to listen to anime OPs and EDs, I always, always stay on to watch JJK's OP and ED animations. Speaking of,
Music: 10/10
Banger music. Seriously, an awesome job with the music and sound design. I also love what the Japanese VAs have done with their characters. You can just tell what their personalities are like through the voice acting. Sukuna's voice is just...chef's kiss.
Characters: 7/10
If you grew up watching Naruto, you'd see immediately that the main cast is basically the same. On the surface level, that is. Even though I watched JJK knowing this from the get-go, I have to admit that it was much easier to like the characters compared to my experience with Naruto.
Yuuji's motivation is kind of lame, what with his whole personality and willingness to accept anything Gojou throws at him in the first two episodes being based off something his grandpa said right before he died. Despite this, I really, really can't help but love Yuuji. So perhaps I have main character syndrome and am biased toward sunshine boys, but I'm alright with that. The whole Junpei shtick, while extremely predictable, was necessary to help solidify his character.
I honestly don't have much to say about Nobara and Megumi, since they pretty much disappeared for the second half of the first cour (I mean, it was focussed on Yuuji, after all, but still...). Even so, they were developed enough that I could feel for them. 
Sukuna is definitely the most solid character there is in the series so far. I love that his motivation is so simple; he does things just because he feels like doing it. He's pure evil, which Yuuji has to (stupidly) learn over the course of the first cour. 
So far, Gojou seems just like Kakashi and Nanami reminds me of Nighteye (I'm predicting that the plot will go in that direction too, if you know what I mean). I'm hoping that when more episodes are released, there'll be more about them for me to love.
Despite that, none of the characters feel out of place, and every decision made is true to their personalities. 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
Imagine my disappointment when I wanted to click on the next episode only to learn that the season wasn't already all up and MAL lied to me with the 24 episode count. Yeah. I binged cour one in one night. And then proceeded to rewatch it. And again.
Overall: 9/10
If you enjoyed shows like Naruto and Hunter x Hunter, you'll likely enjoy watching JJK. Be careful though- you'll likely end up thrown into the depths of the fandom.",9,parmejin

                A good contrast for this show is Demon Slayer, and to be clear I think this show has more potential but at the same time has not capitalized on that potential to the degree that Demon Slayer was able to. Why? There is a massive lag right now between the appeal of the story and world building in Jujutsu Kaisen, and the appeal of the the production values and character devleopment in Jujutsu Kaisen. 
First of all, I'm sure you've heard - the production on Jujutsu Kaisen is in a class of it's own. The style is distinct, everything pops, the shading and extra detail
                  given to facial expressions synergizes incredibly well with the superior dialogue between brilliant voice actors. OP/EDs are just a huge flex by MAPPA - they are creative, stunning, and fun in equal measure. The animation is thrilling to behold. It is so good that at times it leaves me with the feeling it is TOO good. In stark contrast to the budget-conscious, save-the-sakuga you would expect from any Shonen title the Jujutsu Kaisen animation budget has one speed and it's BRRR, BRRR, fucking BRRR. Doesn't matter who where or for how long - if it moved around a lot or made loud noises they drenched it in the gooey spooge of sakuga to the point of absurdity. Must. Watch.
You also really have to hand it to them in the character department. First and foremost, they aren't idiots, and they aren't annoying. Second, they have complex motivations and all deal to some extent with existential dread, trauma, and challenges to their identities/ego without devolving into vessels of pure cringe. Finally, my favorite part - the way they interact with each other is dynamic, varying betweeen confrontation, collaboration, and transactional in a fairly natural way. Bonus, this is true across the spectrum - good, bad or intermediate guy. Also, in terms of development - instead of starting at ADHD spaz, insufferable know-it-all, or vain princess and becoming less like that through four or five contrived events the characters are refined enough to start off as reasonable, mature adults and develop from there. This has the important effect that they can be thrown into new situations without having to ""come of age"" to get through them, and it makes any actual growth/connection and conflict impactful. Example: the conversation between Yuuji and Nobara where they discuss the events of the finale, and she mentions she only has so many seats in her life and Yuuji happened to pull one up on his own. In that one dialogue there, we can see a believable increment of growth in both their characters as they discuss a non-trivial, loaded topic - AND at the same time a believable increment of growth in their connection as colleagues and friends. A great moment that doesn't come easy to the genre IMO. Jujutsu Kaisen keeps it real with their characters and it is a massive bump to the overall quality of the show. Zenitsu would have been murdered by the principle of Jujutsu Sorcerer school on arrival, Gojo Satoru or Megumi would have spat in disgust at Tanjirou's boundless goody-two-shoes act and never once thought to train him, and Nobara would hammer-see-nail Nezuko's cursed demon ass, cute as she is. No contest, which brings me around to my first point.
There is no contest in my mind between the appeal of the world and story in Demon Slayer over that of Jujutsu Kaisen. That final scene in Demon Slayer man... fucking chills. The twisting rooms and the eerie music coming from that lap guitar thing I should probably know the name of... wow. The cherry on top of some beautiful world building. The journey through the world of Demon Slayer feels grander, more dangerous, more important than whatever the hell we're even doing here in Jujutsu Kaisen. So far - and I'm sure we're going to get somewhere interesting in the next few seasons given how on point MAPPA has been - but so far it's like we're set in a universe where Gojo Satoru already became Hokage and we're doing some D-level missions around the hidden leaf village just 'cause. It's Bleach, but we never actually went to soul society to contend with any meta-dimensional threats because they never presented themselves - just stuck around bangin' out Hollows with our big edgy knife. I don't think the pedestrian, but well-motivated goal of Itadori Yuuji is an excuse - Tanjirou started off with a fairly pedestrian goal as well, must protect the sis. It just doesn't feel to me like Jujutsu Kaisen has been able to capitalize on all that razzle dazzle and poise just yet to become a journey I want to see these characters through. Hence my enjoyment of the show as we sit on the tarmac between seasons was a bit lower overall - I wasn't as excited by it as I wanted to be, and fuck did I ever want to be.
MAPPA absolutely dropped the hammer on this one though - literally too smooth on Jujutsu Kaisen.",9,PiereDelecto

Art/Animation/Soundtrack/VA: 5/5
Story/Portrayal/Detailing/Characters: 4/5
Final Rating: 9/10
Firstly, the animation.
Jujutsu Kaisen had peak level animation. The fight scenes are so well animated, that they blow out most shounen anime fight scenes (I've seen) out of the water. You'll find yourself engaged and appreciating every single fight scene while you watch the anime.
The soundtrack was good, and the art portrayed the scenes and other things (ex: curse energy) quite well.
The story was good. It wasn't a masterpiece, it wasn't anything amazing; but it was good.
If you like shounen anime then you'll find the story in this quite engaging. The story isn't quite like your typical shounen anime, it has its originality.
The characters are the strongest point in the story, they all have their traits and (good) backstory which makes them stand out individually; you'll end up liking a lot of them by the end.

then give this one a try.",9,RayRaivern

MAPPA is a breath of fresh air amongst anime studios. Their best anime entries feel like proper cinematic works and this is no different with Jujutsu Kaisen.
It's an absolute banger filled with original ideas that use established shounen tropes and clichés to their advantage. It has bombastic action, interesting character dynamics, haunting soundtrack, disturbing horror moments, contrastingly hilarious comedy that doesn't feel forced and a great MC. 
Having a protagonist and an antagonist in one body has so much potential for future story development and I couldn't
                  be more delighted of how much good faith this show built for itself, so we have almost guaranteed second season. I'll happily be biased towards this show, it's so much fun, which is what matters the most at the end of the day.",10,tuurvig

                Hey.
Long review because it's over rated anime. Was little disapointed after watching it. Had potential but potential wasn't taken and ruined with ""poop"".
---(Spoiler Free with other anime comparisons)---
!!!- After writing spoiler section I realized. If you don't like stupid things and inconsistent stuff. DO NOT WATCH IT. Find another anime. -!!! Or go watch a moive.
This anime is. Action/Horror?/Monsters so shaunen?(don't know anime terms)/Comedy for some reason/Sad story moments.
Yep. They threw everything into this. This anime is only trying to make money and not make good anime. Sorry
Anime has really nice animation/Art/Fighting scenes. They know what they were doing. 8/10. It just hits my like
                  button so it probably is 7/10. But I respect theyr little different style and I like how sometimes there are few second scenes with nice moving animations. I mean when everything moves on screen. Makes it really realistic. Like when character is falling into the dark (Megumi Fushiguro). Or when 3 people run from one big monster (the scene where they run from flower monster on roof as 3). Or sometimes, (rare). In fighting scenes running. Like every particle moves. Older animes don't have that. Sorry for bad explanation. Attack on Titan Final season had few of them aswell. Some of them were bad quality but I respect the try. Older AOT seasons they barely existed. 1-5 times a season?
Story is okay. Characters are decent. Some of them are super bad and only like 1-3 are good/really good. If you ignore the bad jokes and don't consider them as theyr character.
And the story goes around about ""exchange event"". I never liked Events in animes because they are all garbage. I remember 0 good animes where I liked ""exchange event or any event"". (In spoiler cathegory I explain why it is even worse).
Some of the voice actors did really good job. Props to 
""Nanami Kento - Tsuda Kenjirou""
""Gojou Satoru - Nakamura Yuuichi"".
(Top of my head what I remember being the best ones in anime voice actors).
This anime consists of. 
1.Action/Fights. 
2.Sad story time.
3.Really bad jokes.
4.Normal stuff.
But there is the hook!
You need to be really careful when you add SadStoryTime with Jokes.
And this anime does it super wrong. That's illegal basically. Every episode is like. 4-3-1-2-1-2-3-4-2-3 or 1-2-3-1-4-3-1-3. But my point is. When you tell a sad story you can't throw an joke aftet the sad story.
Every time I see episodes trying to empathize and feel for the character and then 2 or 3 min after the sad story comes really bad joke. It doesn't matter that much if this is bad or not but like WTF I'm suppose to feel? Laughter or saddness?
Thowing jokes around so often and sad stories. These things don't go hand to hand. You can only throw 1-3 jokes one episode with sad story and they better be good otherwise they ruin the mood really quickly.
""Attack on Titan Finale season"" does it really well. There is feels moment and they threw realistic joke not over the top like JJK did. Over and over.
They should hire comedians in animes for better jokes.
And I don't even know any person in my circle who likes these jokes like JJK has. Same type of jokes are in ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", ""Steins;Gate"", ""Kiznaiver"", ""Soul Eater""?, ""Kekkai Sensen"". (These came from top of my head).
I just don't know about these jokes over the top. Where they say meaningless things and turn into paper and drop the the ground. Over the top reactions. Where the punch line is ""I'm gonna kill you if you drop my clothing bags!"". With over the top reaction. How is that funny? Or when person trains to control theyr emotions and every time when they forget theyr emotions one ""robot"" hits theyr face hard. Like. Is this suppose to be funny? Was this anime for kids? I mean it has decent amount of blood so who the jokes are for? (Sorry. The jokes are just so bad like the other animes I mentioned. Good/decent stories but really really bad jokes).
Over the top jokes are less forgiving but they keep making them for some reason.
This anime is like ""Kimetsu no Yaiba-Demon Slayer"" (cash grab one and not trying to be top of the list). This means garbage mostly. The story here is better, makes more sense and is more logical/real. Only later it goes out of hand.
This anime just can't be 9/10 or 10/10. Because this anime doesn't even try to be that good. It has too many flaws. What I tell in spoiler cathegory.
I don't listen songs when the anime starts or ends. I only notice them when they are really bad or really good. This anime had above avrage I believe. But I kind of like or really liked first episode endings. Where the chracters danced when they came out of the door. That's nice and unqiue art style and looked cool. And they didn't make any super crazy moves and made moves what the characters wouldhave made. Realistic. I really liked it I guess. (^_^)
Favorite ones were Gojou>Fushiguro=Itadori>>Kugisaki.
Fushiguro was little bit better than Itadori. Maybe because the character sucked so much. :D
---------Spoilfer free, review ending!---------
But people who like to watch action with some over the top jokes and see some stories. With quite nice animation style. Go ahead. It probably will be 
5/10 or 6/10. For hardcore critics and hardcore anime fans.
You gonna love if or you gonna hate it. Because this anime has nothing new.
Only trying to be popular and hit the marked and cash grab like that.
That's why it can't be 9/10 or 10/10. They didn't even try to make it really good. They threw tons of stuff into a mix what popular animes have mostly and hoped for the best.
---------(With Spoilers)---------
Where to begin? :D I start from characters and at the same time I tell what went really wrong.
Exchange event - The story runs around it. In first 3 episodes they already talking about it if I'm correct and it ends with the event. This doesn't make any sense. Curses are suppose to be super strong and scary. Multiple times they have no free Jujutsu sorcerers free because they working and buzy doing the job. There aren't many sorcerers left because it's super dangerous and stuff. But don't worry. Lets have an event!! We have time for that.
(Argument against is. But it's only 2 days). Yes if you don't know how events are made. Someone has to prepare them. Have to catch DANGEROUNS AND STRONG curses. Takes time. Making everything go as plan. Takes time. Making that they are all safe doing it. Takes time. While people are dying what is suppose to be theyr main job and they suppose to care so much about people but F that. Lets have an event. :D Lets put every student in one place with strong ""masters"". Nothing can go wrong if curses are strong and all. xD So stupid.
I hate events and in this anime it was super bad idea. Like I said. Throwing alot of stuff together to make this anime popular for the dull minded weebs/super anime fans.
The story is inconsistent so many times.
Curses/Monsters/Enemies - Sorcerers suppose to be only few and curses are suppose to be super strong and scary. Sorcorers suppose to die alot and so on. But in this anime. Not!. (Whispering:""They even say it multiple times that curses are to be scared of""). They even say how many die in 1st year. (In anime 0). They even explain how strong they are. (In anime first year sorcerers beat the strongest curses in few months). Makes no sense.
All this talk curses are scary and strong but reality what really in this anime is. No. They weak when right character attacks them and really strong when the story wants them to be. Just stupid. Like I said. Inconsistent.
And when sorcerers are fighting curses they are suppose to be at disatvantage because they have human body and human body is actually quite weak. Compared to curses or animals in real world. But some characters have for some reason pain/wound proof bodies.
Abilities/Fight scenes - Why the hell they are telling enemy what theyr ability is? Just plain stupid. Curses are suppose to be scary and all. I can little understand if Mahito tells enemy what his ability is because he crazy. And the other one Nanami, Kento because it doesn't matter if enemy knows he can still use it and hit through blocks. + He is more of an character with bigger brains and fights smart. So that F-s with enemy mind if he doesn't make stupid mistakes. But everybody else when they tell enemy theyr ability is just plain stupid.
Like when Esou and his brother fight vs Itadori, Juuji and Kugisaki, Nobara.
Like why you tell them how the poision works. If they didn't know they would have died. And his excuse was. But now the poision is even deadlier when they know. Well not really. Only when they panic. But you throw away you strongest card. Surpise is the strongest weapon. And not knowing what this poision does exactly is super bad. They wouldhave just died if they started to run and avoid fights when they applied the poision.
Just plain stupid. Ohh btw. The brothers were suppose to be super grade curses but get beaten by first years who have trained few months. xD
Gohou, Satoru - This character is actually really nice. IF YOU TAKE AWAY ALL THE BAD JOKES. :D He is suppose to be super chill and laid back super strong character with interesting stuff. But the jokes what he has and he has the most of them ruin him super bad. Stop making over the top jokes please. They are less forgiving. 4/10 with jokes 7/10 without jokes. In a good day 8/10. (^_^)
Idadori, Yuuji - Why always main characters are bad? This person is just too over powered even when he isn't suppose to be that strong. Yeah he has the strongest? curse in him but he still has human body. But for some reason his has super strong edurance and is super super strong without any muscles. Makes sense. :D The scene where he fights with Toudou, Aoi and gets beaten up super bad. Then later goes fights the flower curse special grade. Well you have just human body. How much it can tolerate the beating? Ohh right. This is main character. They always have plot armour.
Just plain stupid.
Fushiguro, Megumi who has actually really strong ability has the right about of defence/health/endurance. I don't know why but this character is human is realistic but not others. :D
And he somehow healed himself while continuing the fight. 4head wound. You can go check there ix X full of blood and stuff but episode later or more it's gone and only little blood. When did he learn healing? :D Ohh right. His will is so strong and has plot armour. :D
And how much stamina he has? He fights so long and never gets tired. Erm, like wuut? The anime even says that we have just human bodies and we are weaker than curses but for some reason some characters it's the opposite.
Makes sense. :D 2/10 character.
He is so strong he learned super hard stuff in minutes. Amazing. And made the world record using black something. Nanami had the record but I guess it took only 10 minutes to learn and other 5 minutes to just make a new record. So fun main character.
Fushiguro Megumi - Has literally human body. Like I said before. Nice. Realistic atleast.  7/10 character.
Panda - Why the hell you make one characters a Panda? This is suppose to be cool? And a robot. One fight scene reminds me of fighting game panda vs the wooden fighter. Just stop making stupid characters. Please
Inumaki Toge - Good character idea. Everything is good. Has human endurance and stuff. Nice. But man. Why you talk like only with food names? This is suppose to be funny? Why you ruin the character? Make him crunt and hmm and stuff. Like anime Gansta. character ""Nicolas Brown"". Really good character is Nicolas. And he doesn't say much.
Lets talk about his ability now. Can say words so the enemy or somebody does that or something.
There are few questions what the anime makers didn't think through or explain what is important. In fight scene where he fights the flower curse. He says stop. His team mates can hear that too though. He can choose who he uses it on? Or they have energy on theyr ears to protect? I mean he used tons of energy to say it and those team mates block wouldn't block it so well and would be affected by it. + they didn't have block on theyr ears because he earlyer said ""Run Away"" to them. They started running.
2 flaws already. Here is 3rd. Curses don't speak human. Not every curse. And you only see him useing words vs curses who can speak and on humans. What about curses who don't speak or understand? That's a good question.
Okay lets predent they can block his ability with energy on theyr ears. Why they always don't use it when he is close? So he can talk. I mean you improve your energy skills while talking to him. + He can finally talk normally.
Yep. That's just stupid. Like I said. This anime has flaws and cash grab. Unconsistent.
Nanami Kento - Only character what is the best. Doesn't have flaws. Good story. 9/10 or 10/10.
First class curse users - How the hell they beating special grade curses in few months? There is no good explanation. Even when they have those powers and all. They still need to train. And if they trained they trained super fast unhumane ways because theyr will is just so strong. Makes sense. :D Itadori mastering energy control just in a week. :D Fushiguro beats special grade monster who he got clapped earlyer when trying his new really strong move. Ofcourse it works out. And the curse was stronger than the previous one. :D (It says in anime). Lets not talk about Kugisaki Nobara.
She is just a clown without any training. You never see her train. Her ability isn't special or anything like that. But beats special grade strongest curse.
Makes sense. (^_^)
Toudou -- Toll character. Only made 2 decent jokes. Every other 20 something jokes were bad. Just this character is troll. Just doesn't fit into this anime at all. 1/10
Zenin Maki and her little sister - Both of theyr stories are bad. Typical and the same story what other animes have. Nothing special. For some reason this Zenin has super human strength also and is super strong when she has nothing going for her. (PS: You can't master so many weapons in so short period). Her sister. Just stupid. Meh character. Meeeh. Just the usual stuff like other similar animes have. :D 4/10. (4/10 because they look good. :D).
Hanami  the flower curse - Why this curse is weaker vs main character? Why she is so dumb? Getting clapped so hard by sorcerers? I literally face palmed when I saw the fight scene. Just attack one person and use your roots to distract other one so you don't get hit back when the person claps. They switch positions. So you always hit one person. Start tradeing hits. You are suppose to be special grade monster one of the strongest. You are suppose to be smart. Well alot smarter than other curses. Why me a stupid no job jo life viewer is smarter than that?
Why I see so many flaws in 26th placed anime. Am I main character and have big brains because of it? How so highly rated anime is so bad? Give me a break. (This reminds me Fullmetal Alchemist. Not brotherhood. And it was super bad).
So over rated anime. The anime super fans sometimes ruin the ratings super hard. Got tired of typing so I stop. :D
If you have read that far. Don't watch the anime. If you watched it. I feel you man/lady.
Thanks for reading and no hard feelings. I just criticize alot of things when I watch something. (Previously I didn't and I were a weeb. So my older rated animes aren't rated well). And I expect much more of an anime what is so highly rated. And I'm reasonable. I give tons critizism to highly rated stuff if they aren't good because they don't deserve it.
This is 6/10 for me. In a really good day maybe 7/10 (My ratings say 6,3). Even when I said so many negative things because I see positive things too. :  ^)
+ I found Nanami, Kento. One of my favorite characters. Top notch voice actor. Character itself is super clean. At the end it kind turned little bad maybe. It turned little gray area maybe. But I let it slide. Because this anime needs second season. Without a cliffhanger.
The voice actor carried that character. + Nice character.

                Jujutsu Kaisen feels like something that was written by an AI. The model understands what components make up shounen manga and anime, but isn't capapble of putting everything together so that it feels organic, allowing people to understand the story progression as well as the characters and their relationships.
It's very hard for me enjoy an anime when I cannot even understand what drives the main character. He is introduced as a typical hot-headed delinquent, but then he proceeds to accept a duty that will set him on a path of certain death without any resistance. Apparently because his dying grandather told him something vague about
                  protecting people. At this point, the MC became a completely irrelatable enigma to me whose fate I couldn't give one **** about.
In the same fashion, the anime introduces more characters who befriend the MC, leading to the problem of JJK's character interactions. They feel incredibly articial. I can't quite put it into words, but it feels like character chemistry cannot even be described with good or bad, but  is simply absent entirely. There is no natural progression from being acquaintances to becoming friends. It's just a bunch of weird, quirky dialogue put together that the author has probably seen in other shounen.
Then you have Gojo, who feels like he had his character synopsis written by a 12 year old girl. ""HE'S SUPER DUPER POWERFUL AND NO ONE CAN TOUCH HIM BECAUSE THE SPACE BETWEEN HIM IS INFINITY ALSO HE IS REALLY HANDSOME WHEN HE TAKES OFF HIS BLINDFOLD WHICH HE WEARS BECAUSE HE IS TOO POWERFUL"". Pure cringe. I have nothing else to say.
The plot itself isn't worth talking about, I feel. It's not very original, but it doesn't really matter. For shounen, what matters most is the ""journey"", in other words the development of characters and the hardships they face. Since I couldn't care about any of the characters, I didn't care about what was happening either. It was animated nicely though, so that made up for some of the lack of enjoyment I had otherwise.",4,pacemakz0r

                This is a great example of an overrated and overhyped anime in my opinion. 
Let's start by saying that I am writing this review a month or two after I have watched it, so I may have forgotten some parts of this anime. 
And one last note. I am dyslectic and I struggle a lot with language. So keep that in mind. 
Story (3):
Honestly, I really disliked it storywise. It felt repetitive and hard to watch if it wasn't for the gorgeous art it has. They just slay those cursed monsters and that's pretty much if for as far I remembered the show. The part
                  of the show where they went on camp with the group from another city was good. I really liked that part. 
Art (10):
I don't much to say about the art and animations. It was gorgeous, beautiful and pleasing to the eye. If it wasn't for the animations this anime wouldn't be too high on the MAL rating list. 
Sound (9):
Don't remember much from it. It had a good opening and ending song. One of my favourites. 
Character (7)
Most of them were pretty mediocre, But it did have some amazing characters like Gojou and Toudou. Gojou is really an enjoyable character he is serious, mysterious and goofy all at the same time. I just knew it was going to be good when I saw him getting in the scenes. And for Toudou. He was an enjoyable character too. From him being all serious to everyone except his best friend (Someone who has the same taste in women as him) to him being really cool with his cursed technique. that one battle vs the cursed monster was amazing. Him and Itadori swapping places with each clap, wow, it was the highlight of the anime. If only it had more moments like that. And as of last. Itadori and Kugisaki were a great comical duo. 
Enjoyment (6):
My enjoyment for a show comes from the story and most importantly the ending. And yes I know this anime hasn't ended yet and I know it has a sequel, But that doesn't change that this season was bad. like really bad if we talk about the story. For that reason, I just did not enjoy it that much as I intended. Everyone who recommended me to watch it hyped it up. I had high expectations and they were all crushed. 
Overall (7): TL;DR
It is mediocre anime with good animations. It had an awful story and good music. The characters were fun, especially Gojou and Toudou. Also, the synergy between Itadori and Kugisake was funny. Not fighting wise, but they are a great comical duo.",7,Woissh
40748,"
                Just your standard shonen that's hyped up due to animation. 
The plot is pretty interesting but it follows the standard Hype anime route: little to no plot progression, HYPE moment, then repeat, and the main plot takes a massive sideline to other stuff later on that it took me out of the story entirely.
I didn't really care for any of the characters (which is very bad for me cause im of the mindstate of ""you can have a bad story but amazing characters and have it be great but you can also have a great story and terrible characters and have the whole thing be
                  bad) except Gojo and Sukuna but neither are present for much of the story to mean anything outside of THIS IS HYPE. The MC is really bad, felt like he was there just because the story needs a MC. Outside of a cool character design there isn't much he offers. Little emotion, no aspirations, no goal, the definition of a reactionary character. There were some upperclassmen characters that i was interested in but in the end they get little screen time. 
I gave it a 5 because it's not good but it's not bad either. Just there. If you like shows like Demon Slayer, Mob Psycho, Assassination Classroom, OPM, etc than odds are you'll love this but personally it's not for me. I don't know if i'll visit S2 when it drops or not but this could be a MHA situation where S1 isn't the best but it picks up in S2 so maybe i will watch it but i'm not 100% sold on it yet,",5,titogonzalez

                Just another generic overhyped shonen that blew up on twitter/instagram/tiktok.
Characters are forgettable and the plot is boring too, as someone who got bored after 10 episodes of this garbage (I'm surprised I didn't drop it sooner) you're not really missing out on anything.
The only reason why this garbage is overhyped in the first place is because of Gojo and even then if you watch the series or read the manga he really isn't that interesting. He has a cool character design even though it's simple though which brings me on to my  next point: The artwork is cool but that's the only redeeming quality
                  of this series.

                Introduction:
I could spend 10 hours here to list and review many other aspects of the program but I will try to be as clear and concise as possible so as not to write me the whole bible here.
Story: 3
Taking out everything we know from the synopsis and introduction of the program, let's go directly to the bone of the plot, in which Jujutsu Kaisen has many problems in this section. To begin with, the events here (especially in the first nucleus of 12 chapters) develop in a very disorderly narrative way and with a high rhythm in everything that happens, to the point that it
                  seems that between chapters we go on to see the typical scenario of "" the curse of the week ""and everything else goes unnoticed, if even the protagonists (but how could I expect less if it is the same director who ruined"" The God of High School "").
Now, on the positive side, the Anime tries to propose a good ""construction of the world"" from the side of the scale of powers and how they are manifested, although eventually they will come out with a madness that unbalance the system but in principle they have taken it relatively well , and what I finally rescued the most from the section was the event between schools of wizards between Tokyo VS Kyoto where if you could see something really worthy, with interesting characters and good work giving their deserved time, something that until chapter 13 we had not seen by Jujutsu Kaisen.
Art 9.25 / Sound: 8.5
The salvation of Jujutsu Kaisen and the reason why the program obtained so much fame, is due neither more nor less than to the excellent setting work that was created with the animation in conjunction with the great battles and sequences that the program leaves. And the sound does not have to envy him because there he fulfilled to the letter with great soundtracks and not to mention OP / ED for what more than deserved his good score in these staging sections.
Characters: 4
This story is one of those that cares much more about leaving its secondary players well, than about giving rise to us to become attached to the protagonists but let's see it very little.
If the main trio is presented early in the program and the degree of acceptance between them became very easy and they created a quick friendship but the truth is that if I felt an emptiness both individually and from the group, I feel that they have a relationship. years when they did not spend even 2 months between themselves and that their development has been stupidly superficial in these first 24 chapters of the program, being affected by the rhythm and lack of consistency of the narrative.
As for the secondary cast, much more fluid, always nailing to appear at the right moments, accelerate and know when to brake to apply the necessary flashbacks that the story deserves, which is why it is much easier to empathize with them and they show much more solidity. in the few chapters that get over the main cast that is 24/7 on screen
Entertainment: 7
It simply fulfills its mission, although many times I was about to leave the program due to the lack of context, character development (bad narrative in general) I would say that if you are new to this hobby and want to see a nice animation with characters with personalities clichés of the Nekketsu genre and without much emphasis on them, because if I would recommend this program and maybe you even like it excessively.
Personally, I had many more expectations than what I ended up taking, so from my side it will not be a great score here, but this depends on the appreciation that each one considers, as I have been seeing this stereotype of anime for several years, it already seems to me a so boring to see the same thing over and over again without a degree of originality.
Overall: 6.35

Introduccion:
Podría aquí tirarme 10 horas para enumerar y repasar muchos otros aspecto del programa pero tratare de ser lo mas claro y conciso posible para no me escribirme la biblia entera aqui.
Historia: 3
Sacando desde ya todo lo que sabemos desde la sinopsis e introducción del programa vayamos directamente al hueso del mismo de la trama, en el cual Jujutsu Kaisen peca de muchos problemas en este apartado. Por empezar los eventos aquí (sobre todo en el primer núcleo de 12 capítulos) se desarrollan de una forma muy desordenada narrativamente y con un alto ritmo en todo lo que sucede, al punto que pareciera que entre capítulos pasamos a ver el típico escenario de ""la maldición de la semana"" y todo lo demás pasa desapercibido, si inclusive hasta del protagonistas (pero como podría esperar menos si se trata del mismo director que arruino ""The God of High School"").
Ahora, dentro de lo positivo, el Anime trata de proponer una buena ""construcción del mundo"" desde el lado de la escala de poderes y como se manifiestan, aunque eventualmente saldrán con una locura que desbalancear el sistema pero en principio lo han llevado relativamente bien, y lo que finalmente mas rescato del apartado fue el evento estre escuelas de hechiceros entre Tokyo VS Kyoto donde si se pudo ver algo realmente digno, con personajes interesante y bien trabajos dando asi sus merecidos tiempo, algo que hasta el capitulo 13 no habíamos visto de Jujutsu Kaisen.
Arte 9,25 / Sonido: 8,5
La salvacion de Jujutsu Kaisen  y la razon por la que el programa obtenido tanto fama, se debe ni mas ni menos que al excelente trabajo de ambientacion que se creo con la animacion en conjunto con las grandes batallas e secuencias que deja el programa. y el sonido tampoco tiene que envidiarle por que ah cumplia al pie de la letra con grandes soundtrack y ni hablar de OP / ED por lo que mas que merecido su buena puntuacion en estos apartados de puesta en escena.
Personajes: 4
Esta historia es una de esas que se preocupa mucho mas por dejar bien parado a sus secundarios, que de darle pie a que nos encariñemos con los protagonistas pero veámoslo de poco.
En si el trio protagonista se presenta de forma temprana en el programa y el grado de aceptación entre estos se volvio muy facil y crearon una rapida amistad pero la verdad es que si sentía un vacio tanto individual como desde lo grupal, siento que tienen una relacion de años cuando no pasaron ni 2 meses entre ellos mismos y que su desarrollo ah sido estúpidamente superficial en estos primero 24 capitulos del programa, siendo afectados por el ritmo  y falta de consistencia de la narracion.
En cuanto al elenco secundario mucho mas fluido, dando siempre en clavo para aparecer en los momentos justos acelerar y saber cuando frenar para aplicar los flashback necesario que merita la historia, por lo cual es mucho mas fácil empatizar con los mismos y demuestran mucha mas solides en los pocos capitulos que obtienen por sobre elenco principal que esta 24/7 en pantalla
Entretenimiento: 7
Sencillamente cumple con su cometido, aunque muchas veces estuve a punto de abandonar el programa debido a la falta contexto, desarrollo de personajes (mala narrativa en general) eh decir que si eres nuevo en este hobby y quieres ver una linda animación con personajes con personalidades clichés del genero Nekketsu y sin mucho énfasis en los mismos, pues si recomendaría este programa y hasta tal vez te guste en exceso.
Personalmente tenia muchas mas expectativas de las que me termine llevando por lo que de mi parte no será una gran puntuación aquí, pero esto ya depende de la apreciación que considere cada uno, como ya llevo varios años viendo este estereotipo de animes ya me parece un tanto aburrido ver lo mismo una y otra vez sin grado de originalidad.

                Jujutsu Kaisen is a clear contender for best anime this season. It's a colorful, well-animated, intriguing, and overall worthwhile addition to the shonen genre, and when it comes to the formula of similar shows it definitively proves that you don't need to fix what isn't broken. Unless you go out of your way to avoid shonen anime, this one is absolutely worth a watch. 
The story (8/10) centers around an often-goofy protagonist learning to control a powerful and malevolent entity he harbors within himself. This might sound familiar, but the rest of the setting proves unique enough to excuse this common thread, as well as
                  obvious parallels to the same anime among the main quartet of characters. Itadori's struggle against an eventual and seemingly unavoidable death is a very human one, and the main conflict is believable and well-justified. Curses make for sensible enemies, and the villains' main goal of evolving to become the new humanity is nothing unique but still manages to tie their motivations together nicely. Their more specific goals of swaying Itadori/Sukuna to their side and rendering Goujou unable to fight are much more intriguing due to their apparent difficulty, and the viewer is left wondering how such a thing could be possible, especially after witnessing the world's strongest jujutsu sorcerer in action. 
The characters (7/10) are well done, with a likable protagonist and a strong immediate set of supporting characters. This anime suffers a bit from the problem of character bloat, but this is an expected characteristic of shonen and it doesn't detract too much from the story. Itadori, Gojou, and Fushiguro are well-written characters with plenty of development left ahead, and while Kugisaki's powers are nether special nor very interesting she is certainly an entertaining personality and a welcome addition to the cast. The villains all manage to be sinister, mysterious, powerful, or some combination thereof, and explanations for why this is were a pleasant surprise. 
The fights are well-animated and great to watch, and the title tracks border on unskippable (the ending in particular being extremely well-done). As such, the art and sound are a 9/10 and 8/10 respectively. Overall, Jujustsu Kaisen is a worthwhile watch with plenty of hype to go around, and I plan to finish out the season and pray to the adaptation gods for more in the future. Both my enjoyment and overall score for this anime are an 8/10. It won't disappoint.",8,krk064

                I came into watching JJK with a lot of hype and anticipation of the next great battle shounen. Just from the beautiful OP I was already at max hype levels, but then a couple of episodes later it all came crashing down. My biggest gripe about this show is that it shows so much without actually telling you anything. Like a large bag of chips that is 80% filled with air. 
I've noticed a trend where a fight occurs, you get flashy lights, and heart-racing music for a couple of seconds then the fight stops and they stop to go to a flashback for the
                  next 5 minutes, or one of the guys is just standing there monologing in his head about his opponent's next move. It happens in every fight that I come out of this show realizing there isn't any 1 memorable fight. Just go back to any fight, at some point there is a pause where the enemy lets his opponent just stand there while he/she gets to talk to themself, or after just getting hit 1 time triggers the flashback card.
Another issue I kept running into is how they introduce new characters. Who the hell is Ino? Why was he with Kento all of sudden? What about this white-haired chick Uraume? We saw them at that beach plenty of times but suddenly she appears like what? In the last few episodes, they suddenly introduce Nitta Akari out of nowhere, what happened to the other chauffeur guy? It's all over the place with how characters are handled. 
Kento all of sudden appeared at the scene of a crime with Yuuji and left me wondering who is that? That is fine but next episode halfway I still didn't know who he was until guess what, yep, a fight that triggers a flashback to tell us who he is. How did Junpei get his development? Through a flashback. Megumi's development in ep 23? Through a flashback in a fight. Mai's and Maki's history? Triggered through a flashback in a fight. 
I could go on also on the structure and overlapping of this shows' arcs. Within the first 6 episodes we hear about a joint class trip they will prepare for but suddenly Yuuji ""dies"" and we get a training arc and Junpei arc in between that leaving off the other 2 main characters in the dust and gone for a few episodes. Then we come back, and the trip was then ambushed by the villains (MHA s3 anyone? ). This is going on for too long, but overall mad disappointed in this show, it did not meet the hype.",5,Pale_Grey

                ""There are only so many seats open in my life, and I don't want to let my heart be swayed by anyone who's not sitting in one of them. Is that mean?""
There will always be people who share different opinions than you. That's just how the world is, and it's what I remind myself when I read lower ratings of Jujutsu Kaisen. Maybe they don't like magic. I can respect that. However, one part of the anime community that irks me is the fact that viewers enjoy gatekeeping lowkey anime and shame others for watching mainstream shows. Ever since Jujutsu Kaisen got the hype, it
                  seems like people became more and more critical of the show. I'd just like to remind you that this is a fun shounen. There are demons and magic and badass fights.
The art itself was outstanding. MAPPA did an amazing job with the demons. I also noticed similarities between them and the animation for Demon Slayer, which I found pretty neat. Since this is the current shounen aboard the hype train, you'll also notice how the art switches from its usual style to chibi to depict the characters' more lighthearted moments. My favorite episode was definitely the last one (24) when Nobara went fucking feral. She is so badass.
This leads us to the topic of the characters. I enjoy watching anime where I can just lay in bed and detach myself from reality. I get to forget about my physics homework due next week and just watch shows about sorcery or titans. It's even better when the characters feel real, and this show did just that. 
Let's talk address two of my favorite characters from JJK. I'm not talking about Gojo though, as surprising as it is to see. 
Itadori Yuji and Nobara Kugisaki!
Itadori is one of the most relatable modern protagonists I've ever watched portrayed in anime. It's like he's Gintoki's great-grandson living in the modern era. His sense of justice is strong, and he's popular at school. As reckless as he looks, he maintains his composure when facing pressure and shows a lot of empathy as the main character. As for the latter...
Nobara is a baddie introduced into the main cast at the beginning of the season. We get a little background on the reason she chose to become a Jujutsu Sorcerer, but that little is enough. I love strong female characters. I love it even more when they're badass yet there is no need for them to become love interests for the MC. As you can guess, Nobara fits this trope. And it's great.
The soundtracks were cool. They felt very upbeat and pop, and I wasn't sure if some of the hip-hop beats fit some scenes but it ended up working out. I was super satisfied with the casting of VAs for the anime adaptation. Everything seemed to fit perfectly.
Despite not being into magic-oriented anime, I really enjoyed Jujutsu Kaisen. I think it was a great show! The characters are funny and Itadori is the most Gen-Z MC I've ever seen.",9,kqtei
40748,"
                There is two kind of shounen and instead of describing I will sort some examples:
-First Kind:
Hunter x Hunter, Fullmetal Alchesmist, Kekkai Sensen, D. Gray-man.
-Second Kind:
Fairy Tail, Nanatsu no Taizai, Black Clover.
I wont quote the most popular ones of the second kind because I don't wanna create polemics. But I feel the first ones have a deeper emotional development in special for the support characters, they are more distinguished than the authors personality and they are less caricature. I won't say they don't have protagonism, but not all events refer to the main character, they are individual cases that constructs the secondary characters psychological. And I
                  feel like they contributes with a convergent form to the main story with some subtlety.
The second type of shounen feels like is more simpleton. They can't be too deep because their main audience will feel lost, this public urges for cliches and that repetitively habits that make the first impression constant. Its like ""for friendship"", ""for the guild"", and a lot of simple philosophy  that will never change. What make this kind of anime more predictable and the only plot twists are based one frustrating  the main characters goals.
I'm not talking about there animes theme, like ghosts, supernatural, and so on, but i'm talking about how things happen and how some events have impact on the characters. Like when someone dies, the second kind of shounen, they have to expose the catharsis of the first reaction of the characters otherwise the public wont feel his sadness. On the side of the first kind of anime, the author trust the public will feel it by the comportamental alterations it will bring to the characters. 
Summing up, Jujutsu Kaisen its the kind of anime that have a more complex understanding of personality of his characters, and don't get it wrong, Itadori is a simple guy his is meant to be a straight/direct person, with one ideal inherited from his grandpa, but if you have any sensitivity, you feel its not that simple, he being questioned by the schools director is a example that his still trying to find himself.
Now talking about the anime execution, its perfect. I'm reading the manga and the anime makes me anxious to watch each released episode. The timing from the director, the intensity, the visual adaptation and photography are all perfect. For me its a 10/10 anime because the execution, you can dislike the story but can't deny its flawlessly made.
Sorry for the bad english, here it goes my original language:
Existem dois tipos de shounen e, em vez de descrever, citarei alguns exemplos:
-Primeiro tipo:
Hunter x Hunter, Fullmetal Alchesmist, Kekkai Sensen, D. Gray-man.
-Segundo tipo:
Fairy Tail, Nanatsu no Taizai, Black Clover.
Não vou citar os mais populares do segundo tipo porque não quero criar polêmicas. Mas acho que os primeiros têm um desenvolvimento emocional mais profundo, em especial pelos personagens de apoio, são mais distintos da personalidade do autor e são menos caricatos. Vou dizer que não têm protagonismo, mas nem todos os eventos referem-se ao personagem principal, são casos individuais que constroem os personagens secundários psicológicos. E eu sinto que eles contribuem de forma convergente para a história principal com alguma sutileza.
O segundo tipo de shounen parece mais simplório. Não podem ser muito profundos porque seu público principal se sentirá perdido, esse público anseia por clichês e aqueles hábitos repetitivos que fazem a primeira impressão constante. É como ""pela amizade"", ""pela guilda"" e um monte de filosofia simples que nunca vai mudar. O que torna este tipo de anime mais previsível e as únicas reviravoltas na história são baseadas na frustração dos objetivos dos personagens principais.
Não estou falando sobre o tema de animes, como fantasmas, sobrenatural e assim por diante, mas estou falando sobre como as coisas acontecem e como alguns eventos têm impacto sobre os personagens. Como quando morre alguém, o segundo tipo de shounen, tem que expor a catarse da primeira reação dos personagens senão o público não sentirá sua tristeza. Do lado do primeiro tipo de anime, a autora confia que o público vai sentir isso pelas alterações comportamentais dos personagens.
Resumindo, Jujutsu Kaisen é o tipo de anime que tem um entendimento mais complexo da personalidade de seus personagens, e não se engane, Itadori é um cara simples, seu objetivo é ser uma pessoa direta, com um ideal herdado do seu avô, mas se você tem alguma sensibilidade, você sente que não é tão simples, ele ser questionado pelo diretor da escola é um exemplo que ele ainda está tentando se encontrar.
Agora falando sobre a execução do anime, é perfeito. Estou lendo o mangá e o anime me deixa ansioso para assistir a cada episódio lançado. O timing do diretor, a intensidade, a adaptação visual e a fotografia são perfeitos. Para mim é um anime 10/10 por causa  da execução, você pode não gostar da história, mas não pode negar que a animação foi feita com perfeição.",10,SirManigold

                Well, Jujutsu Kaisen isn't a masterpiece but I reall think it's a great anime.  It's artstyle is perfect to me. The storyline is not perfect at the moment but it's getting better, I especially enjoyed last episodes. In this season we're still trying to get to know the characters, their relationships, goals and morals but to be honest I feel much closer to them with every episode and the anime is getting much better. I love both openings and endings but I lowkey get sad everytime I watch the first opening. OST is well done. Overall, in my opinion Jujutsu Kaisen is great and
                  I can't wait to see it getting even better.",9,httpsgod

                Ok, to be very clear, I do not tend to write any reviews, simply due to the fact that the taste in anime here on MAL varies ;
 Everyone can not simply like everything, and everyone have their own favorite genre et cetera. I understand and resepct that..However, this is the first (?!) anime I simply can not ignore leaving unreviewed. 
When I first saw how this manga became (super)popular in Japan (and are pretty much number one at the moment) , and heard it would receive an anime adaptation, well, I guess you can say my expectation for this one skyrocketed. I am not
                  a manga-person. I simply watch the anime first, and if I like it, I might, might, continue on reading the manga. So, I patiently waited for the anime to start without knowing anything about the plot et cetera.
The first cour started out pretty good, or well, I guess you can say I was hooked from the very start. The plot was very interesting, filled with lots of action and drama, everything needed for a perfect start (and quite frankly, a perfect score!!) ..and yes, I really (truly) loved all the characters orz. The only thing that bothered me from the beginning was the poor art and vfx. I mean, it must have been in the bottom if you compare it with the other animes in these two cours. Ok, I was not very happy about some of the choices of voice actors as well..but ohwell (managable enough to ignore).
 I guess it was around the start of the second cour the frustration inside of me started to get louder and I really started to question everything about this anime.
To be honest, like I mentioned before, my expectation for this anime was extremely high. When an anime is popular, I can usually understand WHY it would get high rates or if a lot of people like it (even though I might not like it myself i.e ; taste). However, after maybe half of the second cour I simply could not ignore all of defects anymore.
One thing I simply can not stand is when an anime ""borrow"" things from other animes. 
I mean, if you do it once or twice, and it is not a big part of the plot et cetera I usually do not care about it. But the problem is when you start noticing characters from other animes popping up, and when different important details from other animes are frequently used, well, then you really start to wonder and question the idea behind it.
I mean, shonen jump-animes (mangas) always tend to be ""very similar"" ; adventure-filled plot with a boy trying to save the world from evil. Not everytime though, BUT there is always something unique to distinguish them, right? Like the world might be different, the relationship between good and evil might be different et cetera.. the list can go on, but when you can not seperate an anime from others.. what is the point?
Well, it is not THAT bad with JK, but.. oh well, let me just say, the frequent use of other animes details in JK truly bothered me.
Like I have already mentioned, the art and vfx was from start to end, really, really bad.
I do not like comparing/favoring studios, but when an anime as popular as JK, filled with lots of scenes with great opportunities for great art/effects, is drawn so poorly, I really had hoped it would have been someone else doing the job. (Can it be switched to season 2? please?)
Another big flaw in JK is the poor judgment of storytelling (the storyboard). I mean, I do not know if they stricly followed the manga (again, not reading it), but oh no, no no. While the first episodes was filled with excitement and one could not wait for the next episode, the second cour (stuffed with fillerlike episodes ..?!) seemed like a joke. 
And the constant jump between different genres kept bothering me to the very end.. like, I do not care if if it may be both a parody and extremely serious at the same time, but when the line between the ones are blurry and thin.. I mean come on? And frankly, it may have been 24 episodes, but the story sure did not proceed as far. There are too many questions left unspoken of.. really, too many.
Yeah, well.. quite frankly. This anime was a disappointment. Maybe I had too high expectations, but when it is THIS popular (and already has received high rates) I expected way, way more. I am pretty sure I will keep watching it, because the key (the progress), is still worth watching, to see where it may lead.. but seriously, this could have been much much much better. (and no, I will not read the manga).",6,yaburetayume

                While I made it a habit to review most of the shows I watched sometime ago, this is a weekly show I kept up with and skipped reviewing until now... there's just not much substance. What is one to say about a shounen that hasn't already been said numerous times? Even the standout ones just reinvent the wheel at best. The ""god tier"" shounen tends to have incredible animation, and... yeah, that's it! 
There are a few patterns that regularly make the rounds in these kinds of shows, and JK is not immune to it. JK is one of the better ones as of late
                  in terms of solid visuals, animation, and fight choreography. Clearly, the storyboarding is solid—the pacing is quick... um, you know, as long as our characters aren't wasting time playing baseball or waiting in line for autographs from idols. 
The silliness listed above is played up for laughs, and the serious-looking muscle man character is a softy who really simps out on women the whole show and gets into fights with other people over having different taste in women. It's not funny, and it's lame. I wish more shounen authors could figure out how difficult effective comedy can be and how much it detracts from an otherwise passable yarn. There's a good reason why people seek out comedy when they want comedy instead of a shounen. Comedy in shounens should probably be relegated mostly to quirks that don't act as filler or slow the plot down. Most shounen authors need to ditch the comedy. They're terrible at it. 
The filler problem so common in shounen shows, especially long ones, and most of them are long, is probably exacerbated by the popularity of the slice of life genre. They are rarely ever especially great art (keep in mind I'm not disparaging the whole genre—I think a few are very good, but the popularization of this style has led to some of the laziest trash shows out there)—they are essentially filler turned into a show. Yeah, why don't you eat the fat and throw away the steak or the banana peel and throw away the banana? I believe it's basically encouraged to pad a show with filler—it used to be that studios just didn't have time to meet deadlines otherwise, but isn't it becoming a bit of a style choice? 
Having a show be accessible is fine, but an author is only capable of so much, and the tendency of authors to cover all bases with drama, slice of life, comedy, action, romance, etc., leads to a disgusting stew that no one would want to eat unless they've been conditioned to do so.
Those are some general problems with the genre, and JK partly suffers from much of what I've outlined. These authors rarely find the specific niche they're good at and commit to it, while casting aside what they aren't so great at communicating—presumably because popular series in the genre tend to have these elements, so the mangaka copies these tendencies slavishly. 
Like, does this show want to be a dark horror shounen or a goofy one? It flips between them. We can observe that the straight attempts at humor are terrible, so the latter is something we can assume is not the forte of the author—he's not able to pull it off like the author for Jojo or Hunter X Hunter or anything like that. I've seen some shows that balance these conflicting elements well, but this is not one of them.
On the other hand, the show starts on a more serious note. The first episode begins with some very simple theming that's fine enough to establish our main character—who is a big dumb. Yes, that may not be proper grammar, but it is the best way to capture the essence of the character. He's just a block head who fights for his friends—the usual. Some themes are good to ground the show with a little bit of something to say. That's fine. Thematically, the most interesting segment was probably between the patchwork demon and the wannabe school shooter. I wouldn't say their discussions were all that novel, but it actually works into establishing themes and creating a perspective for the antagonists, and it's a step above most of the other blather between our braindead characters.
The early segments are very dark and moody, with well-drawn disgusting creatures devouring people, dimly lit hallways, and what appears to be a gruesome demise for our main character. Soon, we learn more about demons and curses and all of the fun shounen elements of the show. The innate domains show a lot of potential, many of the abilities and styles for various characters are interesting, but others are just goofy. Among the main characters, you have a talking panda, a character who uses cursed phrases and all of what he says is humor because the only ""safewords,"" are food items, etc. There's that same crossover of goofiness that destroys the mood.
In an early episode the three mains are sent on a mission to a correctional facility, and this segment is so dark, it's almost reminiscent of Silent Hill. They get trapped in the innate domain of a demon, and the skin of the whole area becomes metallic, rusty, corroded, grimy, etc. It's a really heavy point of the series that is never topped. The characters are completely outclassed and struggling to survive. I've never seen so much tension in a shounen almost, and the atmosphere is very solid here. I would say this is an example of something the author is actually good at doing outside of the purely technical components of the work, so he should really look to this as a strength when trying to form a more coherent conceptual framework. 
There are many other fights that have tension, and some darker moody segments afterwards, but few and far between. The fights become slugfests similar to other shounen—perhaps with a bit more thought put into strategizing, and a decent repertoire of creative attacks. 
The peak of the series was at a very early point, then the author couldn't decide between one style or another, and went beyond his talent in trying to balance too many disparate styles. What we're left with is a show without a notable story—not that it needs one per se, but outside of mood pieces and character interactions, we're left with not much to look forward to other than fight after fight. The characters aren't the worst I've ever seen in shounen, but they're largely rather flat and simple characters. 
Sure, the fights are great, but there's not a huge incentive to watch 24 episodes of a show when you can just watch the fight scenes. The fight scenes are supposed to be supplemented by the characters, the themes, and the story, but the show is too shallow for these to act as an enhancement.
That's basically a long-drawn out way of saying most shounen have formulaic tendencies, most authors in this genre lack artistic maturity and cannot figure out what to include and exclude to make an actual good work and not just some trash that appears in Shounen Jump, and they really need to study writing more or team up with a writer or something—all of which equally applies to this technically proficient yet hollow series.",4,Gsarthotegga

                First of all, lemme start with the only negative point which I found in this anime, and that is it's story. The story of jujutsu kaisen is quite simple and nothing much happens in this season. The majority of jujutsu kaisen is focused on fights and explanation of different cursed techniques. So yeah..this was the only negative point...rest everything is almost perfect. 
I enjoyed it a lot and the main reason was, obviously, the character gojo. 
Almost every episode has fights in it. Since story was not that great...that's why it's a 9 for me. Maybe next season proves to be a 10

                I am going to keep this review short. Jujutsu kaisen is way to overhyped.
Disclaimer: It's just my opinion, if you like Jujutsu kaisen then enjoy it.
Story: 4
It's just a average story with no depth. The story gets introducted as if it's going to be a aventure/shounen serie about a boy named Itadori. One day Itadori finds a finger and after some trouble with demons and all he has to eat the finger to survive. It turns out he is powerfull enough to contain as human and demon so he has one job and that is to eat all the 20 fingers and then he has
                  to die. But no Itadori is so different and special he can stay alive and remain as a normal human sorcerer. He is not even a high level of sorcerer but he can defeat high rank curses with no problem.
There is no character development at all!

I have nothing bad to say but the art of Jujutsu kaisen. the anime is really beautiful.

When there is a fight scene, the sound matches the scene very good. 
Character: 5
I've said it before, there is no character development. Itadori is already strong enough to fight against strong curses. The same goes for Nobara Kugisaki. They are first years and already can fight like they are top sorcerers. 
Enjoyment: 3
Everything I mention above is the reason I did not enjoy this anime. It's kinda weird because I really like anime with action. The other reason is because Jujutsu kaisen is to overhyped. Social media made it look so damn good just like Attack on titan but it is not.
I give this anime a 5 for the animation and the sound. It could've been so much better. Jujutsu kaisen needs more character development and more depth in the story.",5,nadia5852x

                I am disappointed. When i got into anime i watched popular ones like naruto, one piece, bleach (these were the 3 animes which i loved a lot especially one piece) while on the other hand overhyped animes like jujutsu kaisen are really boring, i liked the fight and the animation but it feels like the author brought two fine vegetables named bleach and naruto and mixed it and the final result was this. I am concerned about the future of animes. Anyways i don't recommend it feels kinda boring now if you are looking for good fights and all yes this is perfect but storyline
                  is like reusing naruto and bleach's storyline with a little bit of spice.",5,ZANKARTO_69

(MAPPA,UFOTABLE,CLOVERWORKS) studios are all terrible and should not be allowed near any other animes in the future however, i must say Studio Deen and JC stuff are all such good studios that deserve more recognition

                What Can I say, it's as standard battle Shonen. Itadori Yuuji is one of the better Shonen MC's that have been written, with a mixture of naivety and realism trying to understand what the right thing is to do. Outside of the MC however I think none of the other characters really invoke any emotion from the audience, you don't really care about them or form much of a connection with any, we're not really given the time to develop this connection with any of the characters. I think the best part of the anime came in the mini arc with junpei and his back
                  story apart from that none of the characters or story really stood out for me to rate this season higher. The animation, art and soundtrack were all very good and the fight scenes were well animated and were the standout parts of the season.",6,silentvibrant
40748,"
                Story:
The story goes as follow - Yuji eats a finger and it just happens to be the king of curses, The jujutsu world sees him as a Danger to humanity and sentences him to death but before that he is allowed the chance to collect all the fingers of Sukuna then die - saving the world in the process.
Animation:
As expected of MAPPA the animation is some of the best animation seen of the entire year of 2020. MAPPA have proven themselves this year ,to the anime community, and everyone knows now more than ever their animation is some of the best in the WHOLE animation
                  industry. I never thought that I could cream my pants at such a beautiful draw dropping scene of Upside down Kakashi literally ripping of someone’s head with his bare hands(this is a joke I love Gojou). This anime does a perfect job of blending CGI and 2D animation perfectly- not even noticeable unless really looking for it- and the animation in the opening( CG in particular) is jaw droppingly good, yes JoJos level CG OP good. The fights, the  choreography, the facial expressions everything is how I would have imagined it form the manga, they do a lovely job at faithfully portray the unique Jujutsu Kaisen art style ( like what they did with SnK - unlike WIT) and even improved on it making some meme worthy scenes from the manga 10x better and extending fights to the point where they aren’t too drawn out but just absolutely perfect - anime onlys were definitely in for a treat with this anime.
Pacing:
The pacing is extremely fast paced , at first I thought it was too fast paced but it definitely slows down in later arcs becoming a lot better in my opinion .However we don't stay in the school setting too long and waste time(like in Bleach) . Not much to say here except it's really good.
Characters:
Yuji Itadori:
Yuji is just so GODDAMN LIKABLE like how can you hate him? His personality is pretty much the same as most Shonen protagonists except he does not scream his ideology or goal every 10 seconds(Asta/Naruto). His character getting his ideology challenged in different ways is intriguing and watching him grow as a character is good as well. He is not just a cardboard cut-out of a character and is unique.
Megumi Fushiguro:
Out of the 4 main characters(Yuji , Gojo, Nobara) he isn't my favourite as all of the others outshine him by A LOT, especially Gojo , but that doesn't mean that I don't like him he's a good enjoyable character. But he only really shines when with other characters . His past is quite interesting when later discovered in the manga and his family is one of the coolest families in the series .However he has one thing , his abilities on the coolness metre , are only second to Gojo in my book.
Nobara Kugisaki:
She is a treat to watch and her personality shines 2nd out of the main four just after Gojo IMO .She is also actually able to fight and isn't the typical helpless Shonen girl who just cries for help (Sakura) and isn't and annoying Tsundere who just abuses the MC(Noelle).
Satrou Gojo(u):
Definitely the favourite character of the whole series and for good reason too his personality is great , his design is great , his powers are great and his ambitions are great too. It’s interesting to see him struggle with being the strongest Shaman and having to bear the responsibility that if he dies the order of the world will collapse and how he prepares the future generations for it - which we don't see often in Shonen and I wish we did with other stories like Naruto.
Sukuna:
Sukana isn't the bog standard demon inside the protagonist that they eventually make friends with and become a crime fighting duo (Kurama/Naruto or Liebe/Asta). Sukuna is pure evil, tormenting Yuji whenever he is present, killing his friends and innocents. Basically vomiting atrocities whenever he slips out from Itadori. His character is really fun to watch because whenever he is present you already know the kill count is going up no matter what or Yuji is going to get traumatised again - however Yuji usually grows from it and develops as a person. Sukuna almost has a pseudo-positive influence on him - he obviously has an influence on him seeping as he changed his whole life of course. As a manga reader I can't wait to find out what they will do with his character and i hope that he stay pure evil and doesn't turn good(like Kurama) as I think it would ruin his image as the sadistic two-faced spectre…
Adaptation:
The Jujutsu Kaisen anime is pretty much perfect adaptation of the manga. Not much being skipped and it has the same vibe pacing and feel to the source material. The budget is also very large and the studio(MAPPA) is very skilled so no fights are skipped or shortened due to budget. Honestly, to me at least, they are on par with each other - sometimes the anime surpasses the manga.This isn't to say that the magna is bad, it happens to the greats like One Piece (with the walk to Arlong).
Manga v Anime:
If you enjoy the anime a lot and don't want to have to wait for the sequel you should read the manga and keep up with that. However as the anime is such a good adaptation , if you have patience, you can watch that and not miss out on any content and get the same enjoyment. This isn't like other anime(like Black Clover) where to get the proper experience you have to read the manga - the anime is amazing...
Conclusion:
I highly recommend this anime and  manga. It's one of the biggest serializing manga out right now and the anime adaptation is a good place to start - its animation and all that shiz is amazing. So whichever version of Jujutsu Kaisen you jump into make sure that you start soon!
Also listen to the anime opening cos that shii slaps

                Very good and perfect that's the right word for this anime. Each episode presents something great and unique so it's comfortable to watch. The action scenes are also very good, fun, and really cool. Each character also has their own characteristics and strengths that make the story really fun and unpredictable. Each character also has character development, so I want to see how it goes with them. Very comfortable to see the art depictions and funny when joking with really funny humor. The music and sound of each scene are really good and fit the scene. Overall from the beginning I watched it, I really
                  enjoyed watching it and the story was really exciting. It's like all the episodes fit and there isn't the slightest drawback. Thank you season 1. We are waiting for the sequel. :)",10,darkos88

                Something I like to open my reviews with is stating that every season has that one show that breaks the internet a couple of times, and after Demon Slayer's run, that statement couldn't get truer, or so I thought, I guess it's a staple now and Jujutsu Kaisen did more than take the lea until another MAPPA show overtook it on a clutch. Demon Slayer taught us all a lesson, a mediocre story can lead the top of charts with a single consistent and high budget adaptation, however, not only did Jujutsu Kaisen follow on its steps, but it had a better grasp of its
                  plots and characters.
Story (8/10):
As far as the season got, the story still foggs off the premise it tries to present, it has a sense of great progression but at the same time, it feels like everything is frozen in a time-capsule.
The events tend to move at an astronomical speed almost feels like skipping on important stuff but that also leads to short, concise arcs that never drag or get bland at all. I can vouch that Jujutsu Kaisen is by no means a storytelling masterpiece, it remains as simple as one can grasp while half-asleep and redirects all extra buildups to the characters instead. It's crazy how the show can make you feel mixe vibes between early Naruto and Bleach while also maintaining its very own identity with a unique power system that feeds off from HunterxHunter's excellent take on power scaling and battle composition.
Art (10/10):
Only a mad man would give this one below a perfect-10. Very clear to the blind, a lot has gone into the visual fidelity of this show, lesson learned, Demon Slayer. The show can feel very wholesome and calm with the incredible use of lightning and bright colors making you believe you're watching a relaxing slice of life only for it in a moment notice turning off all the sweet lights and effect, casting everything under a rusty dark shadow that feels out of a Saw acting set. The atmosphere delivered is just incredible, very believable, and almost a breathing character of its own, whether it's in the heart of a non-where forest or miles underground too deep into an abandoned sewer system, the vibe of danger always wraps the characters involved, always upping up the stakes.
The animation that goes through every fight scene was in a league of its own in this season, with amazing choreography and dynamic camera movement to the point of a simple eye reveal being better animated than 80% of the airing shows.
Sound (10/10):
As mesmerizing, the animation was, no one can simply gloss over how equally astonishing the audible capabilities of this show were, a work of art.
Let's talk openings and endings, not a single one, no, not a single second one any of them was below amazing. The first opening won the fandom by the first screening. Then the first ending song followed with no breaks in between, breaking the meme economy and inspiring countless covers and spin-offs and it did not stop at that, the second opening and ending were impossibly just as good, that is a feat in an of its own.
The voice acting was also that good, it really felt like a high production show just from the main AND side cast alone, starring several big names in the industry. I love how the show broke some conventions that we rarely see happen, including English rap into its wide OST collection, not shying from building up to its hype.
Characters (8/10):
It feels so suffocating not to give this one a third 10/10 in a single row, the only reason being, bad and boring villains.
When we talk about Shounen, it's an iconic thing to have the first batch of villains memorable and fear-inducing enough to motivate the characters in the early stages of the story, unfortunately, Jujutsu Kaisen misses badly on this one, especially with Mahito who gets an insane hype built around him only to turn up as an unappealing try-hard that does not check any of the boxes of what an incredible early-game villain should.
On the bright side, the main and side cast are just starting on their own, not a single character was introduced turned up to be forgotten an episode later, they feel like real people, they have motives, backstories, and charisma fun enough to make you wanting more.
One of the best things about this show is how amazingly the female characters are written, some of the best that sprouted from a Shounen series, I have yet to see a female character sexualize and low-balled enough to be utilized as generic comic relief. Strength and badassery favor no gender in this show and that alone is very refreshing and worthy of praise on its own.
Enjoyment (8/10):
As much of a great show this was, not a moment of dull content was experienced, however, there were too many things left unclear that impacted my enjoyment of the series. Maybe a sequel will help clear things up, but for the moment, a lot of plot holes if you will have been bothering my enjoyment, but the show already checked on some of the most important elements that make a show a great and iconic one, this is a show that will keep being talked about for years to come.
Overall (8.8/10):
I don't know how the amount of hype that followed the series from day one did not make you curious enough to check out the show for yourself, but here's another reassurance. I don't recommend anything on a whim, not even a 2 minutes long Youtube video, but this is definitely a show made to be recommended.",8,Eoussama

jujutsu kaisen's story has a good flow that doesn't make you lose your interest. it wasn't something confusing to get into and you also did not have to wait too long to get into the action. i think it made you wait long enough to be curious of what was going to happen, but not too long that you'd get bored quickly. and everything was just incorporated into the right time, which made you want to see more and continue on to the next episode. moving on, it was not something fully unique as
                  it was obviously inspired by other classic anime before it. but the execution of jujutsu kaisen is perfect. it takes the template given too them by past anime and improves and develops upon it, to create a better version of what was already there, with it's own spin of course. 
art: 10
the art was definitely something unique in my opinion. maybe i haven't watched enough anime, but i really liked it and thought of it to be appealing. the art is consistent throughout the show. there is never a time in the anime where i though the animation was lackluster or declining. truthfully, the art gets better with each passing episode. it never failed to pass my expectations. 
sound: 10
the seiyuu's were able to perfectly convey the characters. to elaborate, i feel like they did a very good job and that their voices really matched the characters they had. not only were the seiyuu's an awesome fit, but also the sound and soundtrack. i think the tempo and beat matched well with the fights or the situation that was occurring in the world of jujutsu kaisen. the background music was able to set a perfect mood for the audience that either got us excited to see what was going to happen next or suspect something bad was unfolding. also we cannot forget the amazing soundtrack both the new and old op and ed. they were all very memorable to stuck out to a lot of people including myself.
character: 10
the characters in this anime are also like the soundtrack very memorable. each have their own story and reasoning of being where they are and doing what they want. they were very realistic characters with their own motives and goals in life. this includes the supporting cast too, they also had their own backgrounds like the main. and i'm glad they were not there just to be a doormat for the main, but had a reasoning to be where they were, whether it be big or small. and when facing dire situations they reacted in a way fit to them and faced repercussions and consequences due to that. and from that they were able to internally grow and develop as characters. at the beginning it may seem that the characters are generic but as the story progress so do the characters in it, whether it be the heros or the villains. now going to the villains, they were written in a way which i didn't expect and is unique to them. but other than that, i have grown to love all the characters due to their amazing personality and their driven mindset.
enjoyment: 10
when watching jujutsu kaisen, it made me feel like i was with them and feeling all the happiness and sadness they felt. and after finishing an episode, I would be so excited for the next episode. it truly made me feel very happy when watching it. and when i completed the series, i felt empty because i had no more weekly jujutsu kaisen episodes to look forward to. it was definitely memorable and i loved it due to fun and refreshing characters. and i feel like getting the manga to see what happens next, but i'm broke so i'll just have to wait for the next season and the movie. but i with my whole heart love this anime. and i feel like words cannot describe how i feel in whole about jujutsu kaisen, all i can say is that it's perfect in all senses. jujutsu kaisen is something that will stick with me for a long time and i consider to be a masterpiece. 
overall: 10
jujutsu kaisen is chefs kiss! it definitely lives up to the hype and if you are looking for an action pact, bad ass, and lowkey ""horror"" and comedy anime then i would recommend jujutsu kaisen!!!",10,ninismochi

                - Spoiler free review - Only possible spoilers mentioned will be the ideas and plot established in ep 1, and what is explored of those ideas, which is nothing. And that's the problem.
I just wanna begin with saying this is my first review written, and I'll make it as short as possible. I can easily enjoy a lot of anime and don't often pick on the tiny details, this is why I don't normally write reviews, and I know there are people that can do the job for me and put an anime truly where it belongs.
This wasn't the case with Jujutsu Kaisen though, and
                  I can see why - The amazing art, animation, sound quality, one of the best op songs in a long time, interesting characters, and mostly the hype. It has many great aspects, especially for a shounen. but the story is a problem. The hype and excitement that comes with the scenes in an anime along with the quality of the art and sound often blinds viewers against the story and what could've been. I think this is the main reason Jujutsu Kaisen has such a high score (8.77 at the time).
Now I'll explain why I thought the story was such a let down. From episode one, the mc becomes the vessel for sukuna. He can easily go back and forth between himself and the demon, however, this is not explored at all. The mc just doesn't appear to be bothered by it. I thought this was quite an interesting take on it but as the story progressed, it got quite boring. The part that did get explored was a certain jujutsu attack that the mc would later learn with the help of Gojou, I thought this was very interesting and helped me rethink the state of the story. But once again, the episodes after - it's almost completely forgotten again. So this follows the trend once again where: A very interesting idea is established and explored for one or two episodes. While an explanation of it and all the info is cranked into a few minutes. And never again explained.
In conclusion, I still think the main plot and where the story is going is great, but I can't help but think about how much better certain themes of the story could've been. Tbh it was really disappointing to see that the most interesting part of the mc and what started this entire story in the first place (sukuna) is barely ever shown. Remember all of the story is built on the idea that the mc is sukuna's vessel but that just sadly isn't ever mentioned, and left ignored for most of the anime.",6,xSaneZ

                Jujutsu Kaisen delivers in every episode. Honestly no episode was a let down. Consistent good quality in fights and overall. 
I see some people rating this with a low score because it's not original? It's cliché? Really? I thought the whole point of a SHONEN is the way they execute it? There are so many shonen at this point and it's obvious that you'll find common elements in all of them. 
Contrary to some negative opinions I'd like to point out how the MC is likable and genuine and even relatable in comparison with other MC's. And so are pretty much all the other characters
                  in JJk. 
The plot is getting gradually more intriguing and in 17 episodes they didn't stretched the story or felt like it's going downhill at all. Overall I truly enjoy this show and it's outstanding not because of the plot originality but because they handled it properly. Everything is balanced. I'm looking forward for the next episodes and also crying because its getting closer to the end.",10,Iris_8945

                Imagine Jujutsu Kaisen as one big salad your mom made on a summer's day. It has so many ingredients that it all blends into this one taste, with an amazing ingredient hitting you every now and then. Of course, since it looks so pretty you cannot tell your poor mother it tastes of nothing and everything at the same time. However, that feeling lingers. That, ladies and gentlemen, is Jujutsu Kaisen. It is undeniably well put together, in fact I would go so far to say it is a perfect adaptation. Gorgeous animation and a good soundtrack contribute immensely to the enjoyment. However a good
                  adaptation can only go so far in carrying a show. The writing is truly what prevents it from becoming a GREAT show. The first half of season one only has one moment that hooks you in, that one rare ""salad"" ingredient, that being of course the Yoshino episodes. Apart from those, the other episodes feel boring as whatever ""dangerous"" curses the crew faced, they could always call on an op sorcerer to sort it out or let Itadori die and get quick revived. Now, the second half starts to make more sense with the main crew of villains really coming together. Still, they do not feel that threatening or really like a true, synergized, crew. Then, the sister exchange goes right back to the bland mess, with the ""group fight"" feeling more like a coupe of 1v1s in the forest. The Itadori vs Toudou fight and subsequent joining together against Hanami is AMAZING but is cut short by, guess what, an op Gojou solving all the problems by creating a fat chasm. Jujutsu Kaisen only shines sometimes. That is its problem. It has everything going for it but at the end of the day it doesn't create a world that feels interesting or innovative. It is a solid 6 edging on a 7 based on that. Don't get me wrong its enjoyable. However the future seasons will really need to improve on the world building and story for it to go from an OK Shounen to a GREAT Shounen.",6,ghosthitboxes

                Most of us can agree that Jujutsu Kaisen is a good show, but how good is it? Well that depends on who you are asking, i personally think that it is good but not one of my favourite shounens out there.
In the year of 2020, when JJK began airing it instantly became popular and it was a hit, i watched the first couple of episodes and thought that it had a lot of potential to become one of my favourite shounens and as much as I tried to love it like many other people, i just could not come to love it but i can
                  still say that it was a good show and a quite enjoyable one.
Since JJK was announced i knew that it was going to be the next big shounen, it seemed to have everything it needed to become famous and when the 1st episode aired it was huge, everyone on Twitter, YouTube, and even some of my irl friends started talking about it, everyone was praising and so was I.
The story is pretty simple, our protagonist Itadori Yuji is your typical hyperactive high school boy, he seemed to live a totally normal life. Suddenly one day 2 of his friends are about to get killed by curses, so just like every other ordinary high school student, he eats a demonic finger and this gives him the powers of Sukuna who is considered to be the strongest curse out there.
This story is pretty simple, its not anything complex but it still is enough to introduce us into the world of Jujutsu Kaisen.
So like every other shounen Jujutsu Kaisen follows our protagonist Itadori as he gets stronger and fights some curses, it really does a great job at giving us a simple yet interesting story and at first i loved that, but here is where i will stop praising the story, because as much as i loved the beginning, i felt that not much happened, and i just did not like the direction the story took, i never felt that the stuff that happened in this show was amazing, it was good, but it was not amazing, it does everything a shounen has to do and it does it well but i feel that there still hasn't been that one arc or one scene that has impressed me, and i hope there will because i want to love this show, but i cant just yet, i feel the same way about Jujutsu Kaisen than how i did when Demon Slayer first came out, but the difference was that Demon Slayer did hook me faster, but what i am trying to say is that these 2 shows have an amazing beginning, they had all the potential but then I did not enjoy the later episodes as much as the first one.
I remember being hooked with Demon Slayer in the weird moving room thing Arc, it was interesting and i thought it was hella original, and Jujutsu Kaisen still hasnt had that moment that hooks me, and the first season is finally over, so hopefully the second season will have that moment were it finally hooks me, it probably will since i think that's when Shibuya Arc happens, and Jjk fans praise this arc a lot, so i have high hopes for that.
Now, i know some of the things i said might have been a bit harsh, so let me just praise the one thing i love most of this show, and i am obviously talking about the animation, it should go without a doubt that MAPPA is an amazing studio, they have done some amazing stuff and 2020 and possibly this year as well, they have been at their peak, making AOT with amazing animation, their amazing work in JJK, and they already announced that they would be adapting Chainsaw Man, you can easily tell that this studio is on fire, it still not my favorite studio but if they keep going on like this, they can easily become one of the best.
When it comes to animation in Jjk, it is amazing, everything from the fights, the opening, the ending, and even just some funny moments, they all have some of the best animation we have seen in recent anime, and i think that this is what has kept me watching the show, i am not saying that the animation is the only good thing about Jjk, but it is definitely my favorite thing about the show.
I loved the animation since episode one, that one scene were Fushiguro was running through the school hall, it just looked amazing and i think a big part of why the animation is so good is thanks to the art style, i feel that there is something about the art style, especially in the curses, that makes it look so good for action scenes, and its really cool seeing how they turned the manga into the anime, they both look amazing but the anime did a perfect job in keeping the art style. I think that MAPPA is the only studio who can adapt Jjk as well as they have been doing, if they passed it on to another amazing studio like ufotable, it just would not be the same, i think that MAPPA is the one that has the style that suits JJK perfectly, and lets be honest, if it were not for this animation the show probably wouldn't have been as good as it is.
I know people are gonna hate me for what i am about to say, so please calm down, i mean you no harm, ok so... I think that the characters in Jujutsu Kaisen are a 5/10, before you start getting mad, let me explain myself. I am that type of anime watcher who mainly watches anime for the characters, whenever someone asks me what i like the most of my favorite animes, i always answer, its the characters, and i know I would like the characters more, if you know, they were more original, I do think it is kind of early to judge this because i feel that Jujutsu Kaisen is a show that is going to go on for over 100+ episodes, so there is still time for the cast to grow, maybe i will end up loving the characters later, but as of the moment, with season 1 over, I still don't like them all that much.
I feel that these are characters who are kind of generic yet badass at the same time, they have all had their epic moments (SPOILERS AHEAD: If you haven't watch Jjk just skip to the next paragraph), I do think that whenever Itadori use his black flash it was cool af, we also have scenes like Gojou taking his blindfold off, which was probably what made the show famous because you know, it was kinda hot, but interestingly enough my favorite scene came from a character that i probably liked the least, and i am talking about Nobara, I never really liked her, did not like her design and some times i just did not like her personality, because it just is not my type of character, BUT the scene in the final episode when she puts all those nails in her arm was awesome, there was something about this scene that was awesome, and just seeing how much her personality changed when she was doing this, it was pretty cool, I hope characters like her have more moments like these because it lets us see another side of these characters.
-SPOILERS END HERE-
Overall the characters were definitely not my cup of tea, but maybe they will actually get better, only time will tell.
I can easily say that my favourite episode if this show was the last one since i think it had the coolest moment of the whole show and i felt that there was a lot of emotion in it, and it also kind of sets up the next season.
I did enjoy Jujutsu Kaisen, some people may think that my 7/10 score is a really low score, but i dont see that as a bad score, its a show i enjoyed, I think it deserves being considered as one of the new big shounens because compared to some other shounens, it is much better.
I really like that a lot of people who are not even anime fans are also watching this show, its show that i can confidently say that it is for everyone, i am sure you will enjoy at least one part of it, maybe you like the animations, the characters or maybe you just find Gojou hot, I personally am not the biggest fan of this show but its definitely a show that i will keep on watching it since they already announced the movie that will be adapting the prequel.
So to conclude this, I think that Jujutsu Kaisen is a really good shounen, it has a unique story and amazing animation, its a show that almost anyone can enjoy, I don't consider it to be one of the best Shounens but it definitely is a really good one.

                The most memorable and enjoyable anime of 2020! 
Seriously, each new season we keep getting such lackluster animes, but THIS is the gem of 2020. 
Story and characters poke fun at the obvious shonen tropes, so the first episode is quite a hoot! But damn, I didn't expect to laugh then cry in the same first episode? 
Easily on par with Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer). In fact, it's better than Demon Slayer in several ways, especially with the characters and their story. 
As a shonen, it's pretty surprising how well it hits on every aspect of a good show. For example, what may be
                  a good story may lack in animation or fight scenes. But MAPPA took great care in telling the story of Jujutsu Kaisen along with animating PERFECT focal points that get you in suspense! This is no longer a mere anime adaptation, but an art.
Overall, would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially new anime watchers! My dad even got into it!",10,orpheusbreeze
40748,"
                For a MAPPA anime the adaptation quality was surprisingly consistent throughout the 24 episodes. The animation and backgrounds are great but the character design is too bland for my taste.
I'm giving it a 5/10 because the story is mostly a series of setups for pointless fights which are designed to make a character look cool instead of progressing the plot. Cursed spirit does bad thing, jujutsu sorcerer exorcises the cursed spirit with cool technique, but not before over-explaining every detail of the fight and treating the audience like we can't grasp that piercing a human with a magic root was ""meant to kill"".
The soundtrack is
                  generic and forgettable and I heard the same exact ""wind/gust"" sound effect about 10 times throughout the whole season, so the sound design is lacking as well.",5,Headlights

                This anime has characters that are copies of Naruto.
A protagonist who is very strong without any explanation. And without any life.
It was written by someone using the bathroom to take a shit.
A 5 year old writes a better story.
In addition to the whole anime problem, we have political militancy. But it was clear that for such a bad story it came from the mind of a political activist who copies characters from other works to try to make the bad story attract attention. Creativity thief. Without creativity!
The anime One Punch Man has a very strong protagonist on purpose, a satire, comedy. But here we have

40748,"
                Jjk was a solid 6/10 anime. Plot is mid, lots of clichés, animations is mid, character treatment also mid. Character personalities (For antagonists) were great, some were boring but most were great. Fight scenes was also great, the choreography of every Itadori fight scene is pretty fucking nice. It's not just special effects after special effects like Gojo. A lot of the protagonists were kinda uninteresting and boring. Mahito and the flower nature curse were the only good ones for me. Same goes for the other jj sorcerers that weren't schoolmates of Itadori. Todo was the only interesting one.
It's a 5.5-6 rating cuz the cuts
                  were so messy where the tension was being broken by the comedy in such a bad way. The plot had so many clichés and all of the arcs in the whole 24 episodes were just copies of the usual shonen tropes. The only arc that was actually good was the last one (might be biased a bit here cuz I really like nobara). I think the other arcs were just uninteresting and kind of boring. A lot of the techniques weren't all that interesting too. What makes the last arc special is that I think it showcased Megumi and Nobara in such a great way while also including Itadori but not letting him steal any of their spotlight.

                Jujutsu Kaisen, another shounen anime of the new generation, has a simple story, good character development, good villains and other characteristics. The plot is about our protagonist Itadori who has a good physique and stays with his friends from the Occult club, but a cursed object reaches the club's hands, Sukuna's fingers, a powerful curse.
Story: 8/10 is a simple story, but fun to watch, it has humor and comedy scenes mainly in the post credits, the fights are exciting and good to watch too, when it's supposed to be sad, Jujutsu Kaisen is sad, when it's supposed to have fun, Jujutsu Kaisen entertains you, in
                  short, it mixes a lot of emotions. The deaths are very shocking and tragic too and the opening really tricked me.
Characters: 10/10 Jujutsu Kaisen has simply sensational characters, manages to develop even the secondary characters in a great way, has good female and male characters, the villains are incredible and hateful, Mahito for example, the main trio: Itadori, Megumi and Nobara is incredibly good, everyone has nice personalities, in short, this anime has one of the best main casts.
Animation and soundtrack: 10/10: Spectacular animation, worthy of MAPPA, it matched a lot with the style of the anime, soundtrack is also good and the opening is great, but it deceived me considerably.
Pleasure: 10/10: Jujutsu Kaisen is without a doubt a great anime to be entertained, it has a nice humor that doesn't appeal to fanservice, anyway, I loved this anime.
Overall: 10/10: WATCH THIS ANIME!!!! It reminds me a lot of Chainsaw Man, a manga that I also really like.",10,sop12

                ""cliches aren't really cliches unless you overthink it!"" -some dumbass with too much free time
this is one of the shows i was looking forward to watching this season. i've heard great things about it, and i always see it on the popular tab on crunchyroll, so i put it on my watchlist, and after a few months, 2 days ago i again saw it on the popular tab and decided i should finally pick it up after much procrastinating and many 12 episode average slice of life anime. 
needless to say, i was massively disappointed and left with an urge to go back to watching
                  random commentaries on youtube. 
my overall opinion is that this is an overrated typical shounen that screams unoriginally and doesn't even try to hide it, and that doesn't even make it bad. extremely overrated, yes. bad, no. 
let's get into the review
Story: 5/10
In the bluntest way possible, the story is boring and mediocre. It's the typical ""complete grand goal due to what my dead family would think is best for me"" cliche and... it works. i guess. it is not overly bad and not overly good, so i think a 5 is good enough for this anime. after watching 7 episodes into the show, i can and will say that this series is overly predictable, boring, and unenjoyable which is saying a lot since i'm supposed to be the target demographic being someone who watches a lot of shounen. it has some potential for future arcs, but definitely not as much as some people seem to think. the pacing is alright, but i really hope that they give more context in the future as to how much time has passed in between episodes, because i was under the impression that the main three had known each other for a day but then suddenly its been 2 weeks and no one said anything and no one brings it up until late into the episode. the power system is weak but not weak enough to where i could step all over it in the review. its honestly just a copy paste of one of the nen techniques from hunter x hunter but expanded on. like i said, its not too bad, but its just another of the many examples of unoriginality in this show. 
Art: 9/10 
what can i say. once again, mappa blows it out of the water with their amazing animation and visuals. it truly looks great. the only aspect of the show that didn't disappoint aside from the music. 
Sound: 8/10 
nothing in the background is particularly noteworthy, but both the opening and the ending are very good. they are in my playlist and i like listening to them while playing games or staring at the ceiling. hopefully this trend keeps going with the second pair of ops and eds
Character: 3/10
ok, but everything about the story is not too important if the characters are well written and have a good backstory, right? wrong. the characters are easily the weakest point in this series and they are very easy to dissect. they can just be boiled down to ""naruto characters decided to get new hairstyles."" these guys are literally just team 7, all the way down to the way they act and their dynamic. no discredit to naruto btw, this is just a comparison. allow me to explain. 
main character with lots of hidden potential than can maybe outshine the entire cast if they are able to reach their goal of becoming strong, lacking a few braincells and much better at straight up brawling than having to think of a strategy. 
emo friend who is much more experienced with the power system than the mc, kind of cocky but has a good heart and is kind of a rival to the mc although being much more high level at the beginning of the story and having to even out with them slowly but surely. probably has the most battle sense out of the group and knows when to retreat
the only girl is their group and is extremely proud of that fact. fairly weaker than the other two but can by useful in missions. sometimes. thinks that being a girl is a personality trait and thinks that they are extremely pretty but not many others seem to think so. thinks the mc is a brat but slowly warms up to him and is extremely sassy and probably a tsundere 
their teacher who plans for the mc to be his successor and is considered the strongest of their power system's users and is extremely strong. seems to know everything and is used as the power ceiling so we understands where it is at the beginning of the anime. also kind of mysterious (what is under the mask??). has white hair and is always late to lessons and meetings. seen slacking off and showing off quite often. 
so which anime am i talking about here? jujutsu kaisan or naruto? hard to tell huh. lets look at another example of bad character writing. the backstories. i dont understand how itadori is so strong, can someone explain? has he been training or something? and why is he able to fight scary demons so easily? i thought it was something to do with his bloodline of something, but no one ever mentions it, almost like they will never explain. i don't understand why nobaras hometown apparently hated her friend. why did they hate her? because she was from the city? thats it? how bland and boring. how about megumi? there was some lady who saved him so he decided to save itadori. who is she and why does he suddenly have the resolve to kill curses because of her? none of our business i guess. at least have your main characters be a little well written and original. that is something this story does not know how to convey at all though.
Enjoyment: 6 
it was fine. i might have but it at a 7 if i didn't have such high expectations going in. now i'm just disappointed and have 4 more missing assignments.
Overall: 7 
I see the appeal for those who have not already watched naruto, but i cannot imagine a world where naruto fans watch this anime and think ""yeah these characters are original and ive never seen them before"" because that is just a blatant lie. anyone with eyes can see that this is not an original anime, but i suppose if you have not watch naruto or hunter x hunter, this could be a good pick for you. it is probably geared toward new anime audiences, so if this is your thing then by all means, go watch it, but whenever i watch this all i can think about are the naruto copies and hxh power system. hopefully you have had a better experience with it than me though. i will continue to watch and if it gets better i will write another review i suppose. for now its just wasted potential that is overhyped because people like naruto nostalgia. hope you liked the review and i will go back to staring at my wall with a blank expression for a few hours.",7,addermer

""A high schooler encounters an unknown  entity and ends up getting some kind of weird powers. So, now along with his friends, who have their own objectives(ofc helping others being the objective of our MC)  embark on a journey to achieve their goals."" 
Sounds like an average Shounen but the fact that makes this show so likeable is it's characters that are all unique. The show explores the characters besides the MC (be it Megumi, Nobara or Todou) and doesn't sideline the MC(Itadori) in this
                  process(sad Saitama from OPM S2 noises) . The character development is so good that at the end of the show you end up liking the deuteragonist more than the protagonist(well has been in my case). And I am damn sure many people watched this either for Gojou sensei or Chad Sukuna.
The art and animation are perfect. Kudos to MAPPA(they were definitely on crack)
The OSTs were timed well and added to the insane fight scenes, making us glued to our screens. 
Everything about this anime was pitch-perfect making it enjoyable and justifying its popularity at the same time.
Definitely worth watching.
So is it the best shounen? NO! Not yet but yeah definitely has the potential and if the story keeps progressing at the same pace then I won't be surprised if this ends up being the top shounen one day!",10,Just_the_same

                This series is only slightly better than most other random shounen series. Only slightly, though.
The protagonist in this series is unreasonably strong for no reason. He can apparently also  handle the strongest cursed spirit that ever lived, for no reason. Only because he is the protagonist. This makes me instantly dislike him.
A problem this series suffers from, that’s quite common, is the cursed spirit ranking system. A ranking system can be useful to gauge one's strength and compare it to others. But when the only monsters the protagonists face is the strongest grade, all other grades lose their purpose. Saying that their enemy is
                  special grade for the millionth time doesn’t really have the effect it’s supposed to.
The sorcerers in this series are unique. They have different and memorable abilities. The series is also beautifully animated which makes the fight scenes rather entertaining to watch. But they are rarely that interesting, which is mostly a problem with the enemies but somewhat a problem with the protagonists as well. 
The idea behind the enemies in this series is cool. All monsters are born from human fear and the bigger the fear, the stronger the monster. But this also makes them somewhat mindless. They appear out of nowhere, basically have no goal and simply fight the protagonists. I don’t care about them in the slightest and they are obviously the evil side. This makes every fight scene feel hollow and are only there to entertain the audience, nothing thoughtful or interesting. Not to mention the enemies that just like fighting strong opponents for lols, they are just creepy, weird and extremely dull.
The main characters’ part in the fights is simply to exterminate the evil cursed spirits. It’s their job. No personal investment, no interesting motivation, just that they are evil and need to be killed. How very boring.
Speaking of the big problem with cursed spirits in their society. They should really have affected it a bit more. It seems that their world is just like ours but with cursed spirits. A society like that probably should have changed more than having a small, secret group of people handling them, sometimes. This just feels so strange to me. 
My last problem is that a certain person in the series could basically handle every problem all the time. That is if he wasn’t out doing something (idk) everything something happened so that the protagonists could handle it instead. It reminds me of One Punch Man but without the comedic tone. It’s just dumb.
All in all this series is pretty average as far as shounen goes. What really sets it apart is it’s stunning animation and flashy fights. But beyond that it doesn’t hold up as an interesting series on the whole.",6,Lofen

                As you can see from my ratings, I absolutely love this anime, and I am not the only one who thinks that this anime is outstanding, and that is for good reason too. If you do not have the time to read the entire review ill leave a shortened version down at the very bottom.
(*Minor Spoilers Ahead*)
Story: 8/10
As someone who has read and seen a fair share of Shōnen anime, I am no stranger to cliche plots and overused ideas. Jujutsu kaisen however has a seemingly cliche and overused plot but it is executed in such a delightful manner that it is hard to hate
                  it. The MC’s happy go lucky mindset and the “I want to save everyone” can get a bit overbearing at times but aside from that the story is actually unique when it comes to the setting of the anime. It is a very combat oriented story so when you are going into this show expect a lot of battles and fights. The show is unexpectedly light-hearted for such a seemingly dark plot.
Art: 10/10
The art style is fairly unique, and the characters look frankly amazing. The entire show is just a delight to look at and you will absolutely not be disappointed by the art style. However, if it were just the art style, I would rate it an 8 or 9. The real reason I have rated the art a 10 is because of the animation.  I don’t know where to begin on how amazing the detail is during the fights, even the op and ending have outstanding animation and art, I particularly enjoy how in some scenes of the op there are no black outlines, and the result looks almost refreshing to look at. Some fight scenes like the fight in episode 7 (trust me we will get to that soon) are so pleasantly animated. I first realized the brilliance of the animation in episode 7 and its easy to see why.
Sound: 9/10
The sound design is absolutely brilliant with some of the catchiest openings and endings I have ever heard, the opening is a delight to hear and I personally never skipped it, however, the place where it loses one point is perhaps the lack of notable soundtracks that are not the ending or opening.
Character: 9/10
I have been waiting to come to this part of the review, the characters. The main characters in this show feel fleshed out despite the short amount of screen-time given to some of them, there are some exceptions to this claim however, and that’s where it lost the one point for me, I’ll get to that later, for now ill focus on some of the characters I think went incredibly well. 
Gojou Satoru – What is there to be said about him that hasn’t been said already? He feels like he has so much depth besides only getting a couple episodes that focus on him. He is an overwhelmingly strong character in terms of power in the show and is built around that “Overpowered but carefree” architype that we see in many characters in so many more anime. 
Itadori Yuuji – As a protagonist, he has high expectations to meet from the viewer, and I feel like although he might not match those for some people, one aspect of his character feels very well done, and that is his conviction. Without spoiling too much, he has a reason behind everything he does and unlike other “happy-go-lucky” protagonists he actually develops and learns pretty early on in the show.
Ryoumen Sukuna - It is hard to speak much about him without spoiling too much but ill try my best. His character is beautiful, almost the same archetype as Gojou but taken in a much different approach, his character is beautiful and he fulfills the role he plays in the story so far, perfectly.
Enjoyment: 10/10:
I had a blast watching this anime and if you have not seen it, I highly recommend you watch it it’s just such an experience to watch. 
Overall: 9/10 (this serves as the mini review)
Read this part only if the review is too long for you to read. Jujutsu kaisen will not disappoint, the art is beautiful, the fights are top notch, the sound is brilliant, the plot is intriguing. There is so much so love about this show and I highly encourage everyone to at least give it a shot until episode 7. Episode 7 blew it out of the park for me.",9,WeBladez

                This is my first review on here. I typically just keep my thoughts to myself but this one gave me a lot to think about I suppose.
I haven't read the manga so this is just an anime watchers POV
I first want to say I enjoyed watching this immensely and the animation/art and design is superb! No episode was lacking. The fights are wild and kinetic with lots of wild and fantastical abilities that keep you guessing.
I also found the characters personalities to be very fun and refreshing for their typical roles in Shonen anime. And I like a lot of them.
If you want an amazing
                  visual experience, and just a fun Shonen anime you cant go wrong with this one.
However I have some issues to address....
I found the character relationships and story severely lacking. In the end it felt very style over substance in my opinion.
(Spoilers below, Possibly a bit rambly...sorry ahah)
First and foremost the main character Yuuji...he starts off already more skilled in every way than a basic human even before he gets powers. And I suppose this is to show why he can handle these powers/situation later but it just isn't very compelling introduction. We learn he basically has zero family or even friends that we know of?? which I guess isn't news for Shonen MCs but this show doesn't even address it at all in any sense.  His only family member we do know (for about 2 seconds might I add) immediately dies and he gains his motivation for the series from this. Which is a free pass for him to progress in the story without baggage I suppose.
Which isn't an unusual inciting incident or bad in itself but the way it was handled I basically felt nothing for this situation and this new motivation. 
The other problem I have with Yuuji is through this series you hardly see him struggle at all learning and gaining new abilities. It all just seems to come naturally to him. No injuries seem to affect him and he is almost never on the loosing end except once. You never fear for him or really even see his train of thought, its just immediately fight the thing, no talking.
Connected to this is I suppose is you don't worry about him at all because of course he has a failsafe of Sukuna. Who if he wants to can save Yuuji or heal him if he deems fit and who can take over his body on occasion.
Now I found this so very compelling! The MC and the Villain in the same body! What story potential, what philosophical talks and situations can come of this! Only to be immediately disappointed when after the first arc we basically never hear from him for the rest of this season....I'm sure this might be resolved in later seasons but I honestly thought this was going to be the main drive of the story. Where they would be fighting each other every step of the way. Where Yuuji is more powerful at first having only swallowed one finger then gets harder and harder to supress Sukuna as he swallows more of them. They also make a pact which Yuuji doesn't remember which plays zero part in this season.
Connected to Yuuji is the other 2 main protagonists. They are really fun and I really like their characters....but there is a situation where Yuuji is ""killed"" so they think and he is separated from them for half the series almost as soon as they met. And because they just met you cant really expect this to hit to hard. Which is such a shame this happened so early on because it could have been a really impactful scene later. So now our main characters don't even get to bond at all and you feel this when they are shown he's still alive and they basically don't react at all.
Their Sensei Gojo doesn't even really care much about them either which is an unique take, but all of this combined makes it hard to care about them as a team or any situations with them.
Now Gojo....he's just way to powerful which again is a unique take to have one of if not the most powerful character already introduced. But This is just handled so badly in a lot of situations where he is just conveniently gone when he could obviously solve all these situations himself. And when he is there to solve it he can do it in one shot. 
Branching from that; I really don't understand cursed powers at all. (Maybe I'm dumb  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) I think its so cool there is so many unique powers but I just don't see any logic to them or why characters have certain powers and how they manifest them, or learn how to use them in their specific ways. 
Like Megumi can summon Shinigami which is really neat! But we don't know how or why he came across this specific way to use cursed power. (Probably from a clan we learn later I'm assuming)
Or Toudou with his really awesome ability to clap his hands and switch with people/objects? I guess it probably doesn't matter but I think it would be really fun to learn why these powers work the way they do and how. 
They say cursed energy uses negative emotions and basically leave it at that, but I wish they would explore how those emotions affect it more instead of just leaving us to assume. I love this concept because exploring negative emotions is a very compelling way to explore character. To bad we don't get any...
We see no one training or learning how any of how this functions. All we see is Yuuji watch movies to control his emotions less a tiny bear punch him for an episode...
Like a ton of the characters do crazy acrobatics and run super fast yet we are never told cursed energy has these effects yet we assume??
I thought it was more about random people being born with cursed powers and then they get scouted and recruited to the school. We soon learn there is actually clans and some of it is genetic... which I think is a detriment to the randomness of these unique powers. 
Another thing about the powers I don't truly understand or just doesn't appeal to me the way they are implemented is the Domains. They basically function as a persons own manifestation of their power that they control but if you get caught in it its basically game over for whoever is caught in it. Which is a neat idea...but when you already have an OP character such as Gojo it really doesn't appeal to me...
Nothing much bad to say about the villains, they are all pretty great except the 2 brothers at the very end. Just felt like a waste and I don't understand what their deal was in the anime so far.
Not to clear on all their goals and motivations, but they do have a main one which is good. They died and the other brother is upset but again I didn't even get a chance to feel sad for them or get to know them at all.
Other random thoughts:
They mention along the way they don't have enough sorcerers to exercise all these curses. Yet they hold a chunin exams type test where the students can basically kill each other for some reason..
Why do the villains hang out at a beach void?? I love it 
Mentioning things like Jennifer Lawrence and Smash Brothers is hilarious, but a sure way to make your IP dated.
And those are my gripes, Thank you for reading.
Sorry if this is a bit of a unconventional review.",7,Redundantz

                After first hearing about this show, that released in a trailer previously this year, I became very interested in the story, so I ended reading the first half of the series in Weekly shounen jump. I was surprised by how detailed the artwork and the characters were, and was refreshed by this plot. I was relieved when I found out this ""demon power trope"" is being done right this time, and not the typical cliché ones. And I instantly knew that if this series was to get an anime adaptation, It would shatter records. And I was right.
This is already a fan favorite.
Jujutsu Kaisen will
                  probably be the next big thing that hits the Anime/Manga community. I absolutely loved the manga and i have a feeling that MAPPA will do it justice till the end. The animation, characters, action scenes are all astonishing. In just one episode, everyone watching immediately understood that this anime will be a huge hit.
Relax, sit back and enjoy yourself to the fullest.",9,HMomori

                ** spoiler free, brief summary **
1. Story is overall good, but they could do better job with introducing the new world of curses. In no means it's bad, but you're kinda lost at the beginning in what's going on. What I appreciate after I start orientate a little, is the potencional of this curse enegy. It's typical shounen, but that is not wrong
2. Art is also good and animations perfect, I don't like their uniforms tho
3. I'm not a fan of sound they made for classic scenes, but I must admit that the fight of Gojo was epic and mostly cause of sound
4. Characters are
                  pretty good, but not very interesting except Gojo. I don't really care about them yet, but we going the right direction slowly
Overall it's enjoyable and if you give it time, it can bring you scenes that are worth and i can recommend it",8,NutBarber
40748,"
                Not sure what the hype is tbh. This anime is decent and I enjoyed it but it’s boring at the same time. story was boring, characters were also boring, sound was good and the fight scenes were pretty good. The story is just a bit boring like there is no reason to continue it because it’s just meh. I mean demon slayer was better because the story and plot were dope af but jujutsu Kaisen didint really get my hyped at every episode. Every time I wait a week I’m not really excited to watch it but I only watch it cuz I’m bored lol.
                  Overall 6/10. Hope season 2 would be better like a more interesting plot and really good combat scenes but as of rn I’ll leave this anime as “Decent”",6,MrOofMan
40748,"
                I very much enjoy this show. I think the animation is beautiful and the fight scenes are choreographed amazingly and creatively. The jokes land with me almost 100% of the time while also not being annoying in the slightest. And, unlike many anime, it managed to subvert my expectations on where it was going.
Each character is unique, and the show does a very good job explaining why they are the way they are. While the themes are by no means subtle, I still enjoy seeing the interactions between characters with different philosophies. My only issue is that I am still confused on how the power
                  system works, but I believe to be that part of the show (like we are supposed to be learning about it at the same pace the main character is).",10,Bbrits
40748,"
                If animation quality is your thing, I would definitely watch Jujutsu Kaisen. This is a beautifully drawn and smooth series. 
Beyond that JJK fails to find a worthy place in the shonen genre. I'd look elsewhere first unless you've already completely tapped the shonen genre dry. This is still better than Naruto, but if you haven't seen Hunter x Hunter or Yu Yu Hakusho, just go watch those. The characters are just bad. The main character is boring, the one with the blindfold and white hair is shockingly cringe, and . . just avoid this one, trust me.
If you really, really, love the current zeitgeist,
                  yeah, go for it, this show will probably please you.",3,Nostalgiamancer

                   When there is a new shonen jump anime, there always seems to be an extra layer of hype. Jujutsu kaisen possibly was the biggest fall anime of 2020, and this series lives up to it's fame. This series follows the shonen jump formula closely, and even extends further keeping the series engaging throughout the season. This series does many other things right. Even the characters are relatable.  
Story: 8/10
Shonen jump is notorious for having the ""shonen jump formula"". Itadori Yuuji must learn to become the strongest shining knight in white armour to defeat the antagonist. Along the way our main character
                  must learn and train to become the #1 hero in the world! As we can see this series follows very closely to shonen jump formula, however this isn't a bad thing. In fact I would argue that this series not only does it right, it adds more depth to the series which creates a whole new level to the story. Another thing I would like to praise is keeping a max power level. This series quickly shows the max power strength a character can have and keeps it consistent throughout the series. Many series fails to do this adding more and more powerful character ultimately self destructing the anime in the end. This series even adds a end goal making it clear where the series is going forward to. 
Art: 8/10
This series is animated by Park Seong-Hu who does an absolutely great job of bringing this series to life. He does a great job animating fight scenes and even keeps some of the manga aspect. (Sorry if I insulted manga readers) He successfully keeps the art style and even adds his own little hint of uniqueness which in my opinion is the strength of this anime. Mappa do be flexing their animation budget. 
Sound: 8/10
I enjoyed the music and voice acting. 
Characters: 9/10
This series does a great job in growing and maturing the characters. Our protagonist Itadori Yuuji has his own morals which he explores and understand what it really means to ""Protect others"". While it might sound cliche, this simpleness moves the plot forward in a positive way. I would also like to praise the side stories of each and every character. The side stories aren't the main thing of the story and it isn't meant to be. Instead it is just there to support and create depth for all the side characters. These stories help us understand and connect to side characters. While this also might sound cliche, every story is unique and unlike other shonen jump series it contributes to the plot in a positive way. By knowing and understanding the motives of other characters we can understand their actions and reasons helping us connect to them and a person, not an npc in a video game. For example annoying bitches are still annoying bitches, however we know why they are annoying bitches giving us a real reason to hate them. 
Enjoyment: 9/10
I enjoyed this series. This series was engaging and expanded the field of jump, creating its own unique world and characters while staying true to itself. While it does have a few flaws, the strengths most definitely outweigh the weakness. I am excited to see more and the progression of this series, and I will definitely recommend this series to anyone who is unsure what to watch.",9,Koumazoku

                This anime fucks. Give it a try! 
Honestly, a masterpiece is not a flawless anime. This one sure isn't flawless. But if you time and time again siff through mediocre show after mediocre show with mediocre animation and if you don't have commitment to watch Naruto or One Piece or any of the big animes, pleASE WATCH this one. If it doesn't immidiately grab your attention after 2 or 3 episodes, drop it. It's fine. 
But if you've been waiting for an anime where you can feeel the amount of fun the writers had with the source material, an anime where you are going to
                  have just as much fun as them, then, baby, this is the one. I know I've been waiting for an anime that reminds me how much fun the shounen genre can be. 
The characters are lovable, the tropes are very tongue-in-cheek, the animation is consistent and great. I don't know what about the show makes it ooze so much charm for me. I didn't like the manga that much, i even dropped it. But the anime is better than the manga, dare i say.

                Show me a person who doesn’t think this show is amazing and i'll show you an idiot. This show literally has it all. Story, action, Lore, animation, well written characters, Seriousness, comedy. Everything you can ask from a show is right here. 
I just wanted to talk about the characters. If theres one thing JJK has over 90% of current shows are its amazingly written characters. Every single character has its own ideals and a level of uniqueness to them. But most of all what they all have is a realistic personality/nature and what i mean by that is.. that they are not too much
                  of this ""one person"" who fails to be anything other than that ""one person"". I know this is hard to understand but what i mean is that everyone has emotion and everyone react to diff things differently. Long story short, NONE OF THEM ARE ONE DIMENSIONAL is wat im trying to say. Honestly I cant point point my finger towards a single characters and say they are generic.  For eg Mai, i thought she was gonna be that typical annoying tsundere character that for some reason alot of these anime have but after ep 17 i can enjoy and appreciate whenever shes on the screen. 
Now lets talk about our 3 Main Characters~
Firstly our Protag, Itadori Yujji, one of my fav MCs of all time. Where do i even begin with this man. My fav trait about him is dat he is so understanding, unlike every generic MC ever, he doesn’t try to impose his mortals/believes onto others while not giving a single **** about their situation. In his interaction with Junpai, he literally says ""I've said alot of self important stuff without knowing what happened so lets talk about it"" I dont think ppl understand how great this quality is about our lovable Protagonist-kun. Also his talk with Megumi in ep 5 or 6 is another great example of how understanding he rly is. 
Secondly, Megumi. My first impression of him was ""ohh hes gonna be that Sasuke-ish or that gloomy for no reason character"" but oh boy, how wrong i was. Imo he has the potential of being the most interesting character in the entire show and im saying this solely offa the 1st season. He cares about the MC and SHOWS it. The scene where he was like ""Did something happen Itadori, you wanna talk about it?"" just goes to show how great he is as a character and as a friend. 
Third, our female MC, Nobara, FINALLY a well written female character in shonen. This is honestly more rare than Dimond in a chuck of coal. Tho tbh alot of these new shows are improving their females and im all for it. She has an unique personality, amazing relationships with other characters, dope powers and just an all around well written female character. And i absolutely luv and adore her relationship with our MC, they are the perfect mixture of cute and chaotic energy. Also i luv the fact that the author didn’t make her OP but shes still so fkn badass. I just wanted to quote this from Nobara ""I don't give a damn about ""men"" this or ""women"" that, I love myself when i am pretty and all dressed up! And i love myself when i am strong. I am Kugisaki Nobara"" this alone should tell y'all just what she is about and it not just her, all female characters are so well written in this story mayb its just seeing badly written ones but they seem seriously impressive and have individual value to the story to different extents and it doesn't have sexualization of females for fanservice or some love interest BS either. 
Overall this show is a solid 10/10 in my books, its takes the classic overused cliche tropes and makes them unique/interesting while keeping everything relevant to the story, which is so fkn dope imo.",10,CRuEL_WOrlD
40748,"
                The animation is awesome, the fight scenes posted on youtube got me hooked so I decided to watch it.
The story sucks though (the details at least, the overall story is fine), mostly because most of the characters don't behave like one would expect normal people to behave in almost any given situation. Especially the main characters. Maybe it's explained in the source material or something, e.g. that jujutsu messes with your brain so you're weirdly one-dimentional, or maybe the problem is with the source material. I for one also don't like the tonal shifts between comedy and drama. Feels like the first Fantastic Beasts and
                  Where to Find Them movie (after watching the first one, I didn't watch the rest, even though I'm an HP fan), where if felt they tried to cram two separate films (a drama and a kids movie) into one. 
If the animation and the consequently the fight scenes weren't so good, this show most likely woulnd't have enjoyed the hype it has, in my opinion.",6,QueenMargosha
40748,"
                So spoiler I haven't watched the whole thing yet since I am watching it as it comes out. BUT! I will say that this could go down as a top 5 anime for the last ten years... yes it has that kind of potential.
The animation is absolutely spot on gorgeous that I actually like watching the intro and outro and shocker! the writing style matches the animation~ who would have guessed that those two things actually are important.
I am however very disappointed that the character tropes are far too similar to Naruto, wont go into detail but now that you have read this you will
                  not be able to un-see it.
So tldr I am 7 episodes in and I am super interested in seeing how they expand this world and I REALLY hope they follow through on the good writing and animation. I have recommended this to everyone I know and so far I have yet to find anyone who has not enjoyed it thus far into its release.",9,CrayClown

                This show is safe for people with epilepsy/seizures no flashing at all which is very rare for a action anime. As of episode 14 avoid watching the new intro it has lots of flashing toward the end as well the commercial break half way through show has more contrast now and may trigger seizure try to avoid. No fight scenes as of yet have flashing.
This anime is like a good slow cooked stew.
Some anime you know after two episodes what to expect from the show. I wouldn't say that the real atmosphere of the world our characters are in starts to show until episode 8.
                  We are given little pieces and its very slow but once it hits episode 8 the wait was while worth while. 
10/10 looking forward to more episodes.
It's very rare for a show of this quality to come out often. I have a feeling that now that the world is set up properly the show can only go up from here.",10,ValkyrieRandgris

                Jujutsu kaisen is easily the best new gen shounen anime i have watched. The story is okay but the characters make this show really enjoyable as the cast of characters is pretty wide.
The show it self is pretty confusing as for example the cursed energy thing doesn't really get explained well enough in the show. That and the story brings this show from a 10/10 to a solid 9/10.
The story of this show is pretty good in my opinion as it starts with Itadoris Grandfather dying and saying to him that Itadori should have lots of people so he could die recognized. For this reason
                  Itadori joins a special school to learn the skills of a jujutsu sorcerer. That's the start of the story it continues more but i don't wanna spoil too much.
Characters of this show are really enjoyable to watch as the main cast is really good in my opinion. Itadori Yuuji is on of my favorite MC of all anime. I know some people like to say that Itadori has a bland personality but in my opinion he has his moments and is really likable. Kugisaki Nobara is a strong and independent woman which i like with the dynamic of Itadori and Megumin. Nobara is a likable character as she has some personality to her. Fushiguro Megumin is an introvert who doesn't talk to people that much only when he is needed to. Hes a strong boy who also has his moments along side Itadori and Nobara. Gojo Staoru is ""the"" character of Jujutsu kaisen. He is a overly happy character who posesses overpowered techniques. Gojo is pretty likable as hes very overpowered and can out body anyone is its needed. The rest of the cast are just from another school or older people.
The enjoyment of the show is really good as the Characters have really good dynamics between each other and make the fights interesting. You probably think the show is the typical ""power of friendship"" but its actually not that. The characters have their own moments in the show without people supporting them.
Overall ill give a solid 9/10. Really enjoyable and makes this show into my top 5 anime.",9,Rafugito

                Short Review: (minor spoilers regarding characters)
Jujutsu Kaisen is mostly a solid shonen, with some departments (battle sequences, absurd humor, interesting ambiguity and side characters) stronger than the currently most popular shonen Demon Slayer, but other departments (empathy, plot coherence, main character) weaker. If you are a jaded manga reader/ anime watcher, you would recognize too many classics in Jujutsu Kaisen. Hunter X Hunter, Parasyte, Devilman, sometimes even Chainsaw Man. For better or worse, it's a genre mashup unsure of its own identity.
Baseline quality: 7.5-7.8/10. A solid shonen with interesting premise but suffering identity crisis. 
Pros: 
+ Fighting sequences. You can tell how much the author
                  loves Hunter X Hunter, and more often than not that's a good thing. Toudou and Idatori's cooperation is basically copy-and-pasted from Knuckle Bine and Killua's cooperation in Hunter. Still, as bread and butter of this show, fighting sequences are mostly solid. 
+ Overall animation and art. The characters are easy to distinguish, and most visual elements quite easy on the eyes. Smooth blending of 2d and 3d elements also helped the show greatly. In comparison most female characters in Demon Slayer share the same face.
+ Interesting premise and ambiguity. The MC, at least at the beginning of the story, was interesting. He went on the heroic path because of another character's dying words (which might have magical or curse power on him, we never learned for sure). Also, the path of a Jujutsu user is essentially meddling with curse/demonic powers with a twisted mind/personality (at least that's what we learned from EP1-3). An interesting ambiguity is set up as the hidden plotline. 
+ Humor is more palpable and absurd here than some mainstream shonen. Unlike the most prominent offenders of turning characters chibi during intense scenes for comic relief or having annoying characters acting hysterical for minutes (cough* Demon Slayer *cough; cough* FMAB cough*), humor in this show is mostly self-contained and with more flares (absurd but not breaking my immersion). 
Cons: 
- However, the ambiguity aforementioned was mostly undone in the first season. The good guys are really just flat good. Bad guys and schemers never stop scheming. As the story progresses, I hardly feel the heavy consequences and cost of being a great Jujutsu user. It felt as if the author is too scared to take off the plot armor from the main heroes. 
- That attitude can also be felt in the overall plot development. After 24 episodes, we still have no idea about the endgame for the MC to swallow those cursed fingers. Yes, the bad guys are plotting to release the most powerful cursed one into the human realm. But then what?
- When I finished Season 1, my impression is that the MC has long forgotten his grandpa and his dying words. The core team is training hard and getting stronger, but don't all Shonen do that?
- The biggest problem, as mentioned by other reviewers, is the apparent identity crisis the show/manga is suffering from. Intensely borrowing from or paying homage to classic works may not be a sin in itself, but Jujutsu Kaisen's potential for being a truly unique, striking shonen is at risk here. Had the show gone with absurdity all the way through, it could have been a cult classic. For now, it's too weird and complex to be the next mainstream king of shonen, yet too mainstream to be the next Chainsaw Man.",7,JoexySun

                Jujutsu Kaisen is basically a more polished Naruto, and from a shounen addict a more polished Naruto is what i want, on top of that it's just enjoyable in every way
Characters are enjoyable and pretty good, humor is my type, fights are Chunin-exam level good, animation it's bombastick, the creator know what he is doing and is doing it really good, other than that the sound and the music slaps, especially the fight theme and the 1st opening, good power system that rivals the stand powers from Jojo, so yeah, a pretty good anime i'd say
Yuuji is still your average happy shounen protagonist but with
                  a twist, he knows that people die, he knows that people are bad sometimes, and he is ok with it, his objective isn't to save all (I'm looking at you Deku), it's to give them a proper death and let them die the way they want",10,_4ndr3A

Jujutsu Kaisen is undoubtedly a show that has received a lot of traction recently. It has a very high rating on this website, has won 3 awards at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards, and even won Anime of the Year for 2020. To be quite honest with you, after seeing that the director for JJK is the same for God of Highschool, I was not expecting much from the show. However, the hype for JJK pushed me to check it out, and boy, am I glad I did. Let's
                  dissect why I think Jujutsu Kaisen is excellent for a battle shounen. 
Plot- Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way. Jujutsu Kaisen isn't the most original shounen to come out. It has some very cliche tropes, such as having dead/missing parents, a lot of dialogue during fights, and a tournament arc. However, I firmly believe this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Some of the best-written fiction draws inspiration from other top works. Why does it matter if a show is original if it's not written well? Sometimes, tropes exist because they work. Not only that, but Jujutsu Kaisen does have a few aspects that do differ from other shonuens. Jujutsu Kaisen isn't afraid of taking on challenging issues such as depression, bullying, sexism, and current society. It also can balance comedy with tragedy exceptionally well, and the power system is interesting. Jujutsu Kaisen gives you many things to think about, and I applaud them for that. My only critique for the plot of JJK is that there is a light sprinkle of fillers that was awkwardly placed, but overall I enjoyed it. 
Art and Sound- The art for Jujutsu Kaisen is outstanding. The fights are well-choreographed, and the music hypes it up. At no point did the art hinder any of the show, and the voice actors are also top-notch. My only complaint is that the sound mixing is sort of nonexistent. Sound mixing is when you mash together multiple different sounds (dialogue, OST, background noise) into one scene. It's not something obvious to notice, but it doesn't immerse you in the setting. For comparison, shows like Monogatari and Hyouka have sound mixing that makes you think you are in the anime location. It's a minor nitpick, but I do want to see it improved in the future. 
Characters- The characters for Jujutsu Kaisen are simply amazing. The leading trio, Yuuji, Nobara, and Fushiguro, all are able to interact together with great chemistry. They each have different backgrounds, goals, and personalities, but the anime does a great job in letting them work together. However, we need to talk about Gojo Satoru and Kento Nanami. Gojo Satoru is something I rarely see done well in anime, namely an overpowered character. The main problems with having an overpowered character in a story are that 1. you cannot create many problems because they fix all of them with their powers, and 2. their personalities are typically nonexistent because the main focus is on their overpowered abilities. However, the show can still have problems and conflicts due to Gojo's ideology, and he doesn't lack personality. Next, Kento Nanami is just one of my favorite characters in anime of all time. At first, I was already on board with his non-bs attitude and cynical view of life, but seeing his backstory of how he ended up in this way truly made me his fan. He had a comfortable upper-income job but wasn't making society a better place. Instead, he was simply making the rich more prosperous as a salaryman. Thus, he realized this and decided to become a Jujutsu Sorcerer to make society a better place. I think this is not only an excellent critique of current society (there are a lot of jobs right now that are nonvital but are high paying) but also is a beautiful character story that explains the way he is today. I also do want to give props to JJK for having a diverse and exciting female cast. The women in JJK have interesting backstories and different personalities, which surprisingly isn't the case with a lot of shounen. Also, through this, JJK can critique the backward thinking of age-old gender norms. Overall, the characters in JJK are amazing, and I thoroughly enjoy reviewing them.
Enjoyment- JJK's enjoyment level for me is very high. The mysteries keep me on the edge of my seat, the ideas in JJK keep me thinking, and there are just some incredible fight scenes that made me audibly gasp. I cannot wait for more seasons of JJK, and I highly recommend it. 
Overall- Even though JJK has many shounen tropes, it has many things that set it apart. This is not your average shounen and is just an incredible anime in general. The characters are likable, the story is interesting, and I have rewatched the fight scenes countless times. I suggest anyone reading this to check out the first few episodes at least, and even if you didn't like it, well, you still saw the epicness that is Gojo Satoru. Thank you for reading, and I hope to review more of JJK in the future.",9,Zhuwx1

                It wasn't a waste of time in my opinion. It was not bad, but there are better ones than that, of course, that is a separate issue. The illustrations for this anime were extremely beautiful. The characters are visually very good and of good quality. I liked only this aspect of drawing and animation, but it remained weak as a subject and remained in the background. He had it watched, but there was no place to say ""Wow"". So, they took a little bit of this, a little of that, added a little bit of themselves, and finally made something out of it. All the
                  characters were drawn with great care. So, as you can see, I can talk more about drawing and animation than the subject. In other words, the story and the subject remained in the background to that extent. One problem is that the characters appear to be not fully worked out. As if there is a lack of emotion. In this respect, I would love to see the character development in the upcoming new episodes.
   I would also like to say that if there was no Uncle Gojo in this anime, or if his beauty did not meet people's perception of beauty, those scores would never have been high. Including other characters. I think it is very popular because of people's perception of beauty. I don't think it's good enough to call it the best anime.",6,HorizonO_o

                *sigh* This was surprisingly boring. I expect more from an anime which is so highly rated as this one, than the usual cheap moralization, easily digestable empty phrases, tropes with minimal spins at best, cliché characters with bog standard backstories (also their artstyle were in my uncanny valley), unintersting storyline etc. All in all a meaningless popcorn action. There is quite a few cool fight scenes with good animation. That's about it. I don't really get it why this is so hyped. The are countless other identical blend shounen out there. I guess if the animation is good it sells the mediocre writing. Not if
                  this is worse than the other ones on the market, it just doesn't really have any value other than the visuals. Well, anyway I don't really feel like to write a longer review about this. If you want to watch some brainless, but well animated fights you may like it, but don't expect much more. Disappointment... I guess, I'm not a fan of the shounen genre.",6,EyeAmTheI
40748,"
                Jujutsu Kaisen is one of the anime that I enjoyed a lot after finished watching the full season of it. It is as shounen as it can get, so if it isn't your thing...I can see why people not a fan of it.
The plot started from Yuji Itadori interaction with curses and eventually having to deal with one of the most powerful and violent cursed spirit, Sukuna. If you thought the story will mostly revolve around Yuji only, it isn't like that. Sure Yuji is the centre of the attention in most of the arcs but I still see a lot of character development with
                  other characters in the series. 
I come into this series purely watching the anime from the start, I didn't read any of the manga at all so please treat my review with that in perspective. I think there is a good reason why this Season 1 revolves around Yuji and his grow in character and grow in relationship with the people around him and so far, it's working. 
The art of the anime is really good, all of the fight scenes are done really well. If you are familiar with MAPPA, I think you will enjoy the fight scenes a lot in the anime. What really stands out for me are the soundtrack, MAPPA sure know how to make a fight even more exhilarating with their soundtrack, especially the last fight scene of the Season 1....that is one of the best use of soundtrack I've ever experience in anime fight scenes.
Jujutsu Kaisen is really solid shounen anime with lots of promising Season 2 prospects. The movie, Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is also interesting and I think if you enjoy this series, you will be interested in that as well. 
There are a lot of characters stand out in Season 1 beside Yuji as Gojo, Megumi and Nobara have their equal share of character development and good display of their respective powers. We shall see what the Season 2 holds for this anime but the prospect is looking really good.",9,DhiJan

                It's been a while since I've been able to watch a shounen and have no gripes with it. Jujutsu Kaisen delivers what a shounen anime should be and perfects the genre in almost every category. From the characters to story to action to comedy, it fires on all cylinders and delivers an amazing performance.
Story: 8 - The story isn't some change your life in one season masterpiece but for what it is, it is outstanding. Building on past shounen's JJK uses its world and brings it to life and offers no boring moment. The story is very similar to other shounen's such as Bleach and
                  Naruto but instead of stagnating at certain points and drawing out plot points for more than what they're worth, JJK's story highlights its world, its character, and most importantly, curses well. Not rushing or slowing down, the story does its job engaging the watcher. 
Art: 10 - Animation is the best I've seen in any anime. That's really all I can say. The fight scenes are amazing and the animation just flows incredibly well with no stiffness. 
Sound: 9 - Sound design and OST's are incredible and keep you engaged with the show. When a character is getting smacked around you can feel it and when a character is beating the hell out of someone you can also feel it. Every action sequence has a banger OST next to it. The emotional moments have the same and even mundane moments have good music in them.
Character: 10 - The characters are relatable unlike 99% of shounen. The protagonist is just a normal guy wanting to protect his friends and family. The high school students are just normal students who have normal likes/dislikes. This is the first anime where I have not had a gripe against the protagonist. Even the villains are relatable and have amazing personalities. 
Enjoyment: 10 - If you are looking for any shounen to just enjoy, JJK is it. Action scenes that slap hard, characters that are hilarious, and a story that's easy to follow all make it so much fun. 
Overall: 10 - This anime has not redefined the shounen genre but it has perfected its elements and pushed them far. This truly is one of the best new animes out there and if you've read the manga you know it's only going to get better.",10,soabs

                Ok, I’ll keep this review short. (English is not my native language, so bear with me)
This anime is hyped to the moon and back. Just like Demon Slayer, the animation is gorgeous, made me jump in excitement, and that is it. The story is generic, the comedy is not funny in some places, and it took me few episodes to actually invest into the characters.
Before I watched it, people made it sound like this is the show that will take Shonen to a whole new level, and it is not. 
My advice is watch this show with low expectations, because you will be disappointed otherwise.

Short Review
Jujutsu Kaisen is good, go watch Jujutsu Kaisen. This is how Shounen should be done for years to come.
Full Review
Despite the lacking story, there was never a dull moment in this show. I was thoroughly engrossed in every dialogue, scenery drop, and fight from episode 1 to 24. This goes to show you don’t have to have a GREAT story to make a great Shounen Anime; production is as crucial as your plotline (looking at you, My Hero, and DB). Much like Naruto, though, the show's highpoint is its nearly FLAWLESS animation thanks to Studio MAPPA. I can’t tell you how refreshing it
                  is to see something as consistent as this from a show EVERY EPISODE. And it’s not only the fights that hold this, but you can appreciate the work they put in by observing just how fluid and natural it looks.
A good example is Fushiguro running through Yuuji’s high school to Intercept a cursed spirit in Episode 1. Something I can give the sweetest chef kiss. But aside from the animation, I can also say I am thoroughly impressed by the creator’s work in building these dynamic characters. Our Main Female Protagonist, Kugisaki, is someone who I’d like to highlight. I say this because she is a character I feel who has broken the chain from the useless (Sakura), unrealistic (Uraraka), or emotionless stoic(Mikasa). Not to say that I’m not a fan of those archetypes, but I will say that the diversity for female protagonists has always been lacking. A highlight of her personality how she will verbally abuse her opponents no matter who they are or how strong they are. 
She’s a fierce character not looking to back down and who can act independently: a very well-rounded character personality and goals to match. I also want to highlight how well they handled the slew of characters in the second half of the season like Big Brother Toda, Maki, and one of my personal favorites Nanami. I’ve gone on long enough about the show, but I would highly recommend it to any and everyone. JJK has easily broken into my Top 5 with just this First Season, and I’m eagerly awaiting the Prequel film as well as the 2nd Season. Thanks for reading

JJK is a brlliant anime with epic soundtrack, good storyline, cool characters and an outstanding animation. Firstly i would like to praise MAPPA's brilliantly made animation and its truly awesome art style making our watch-time miraculous. And its soundtrack just adds more to the enjoyment. Its first opening was just too great and the second opening was not as great as the first one but its animation style just made it look impressive.
                  And can't forget about the endings which were also marvelous. I wanna say one thing which is that all the characters in this anime are just too good to be frank, I honestly dont have one character that i hate in JJK. All the characters have their own abilities and style making each of them unique and distinctive. It honestly was too hard for me to choose one favourite character among so many good characters. But even so my most favourite characters are Gojou Satoru, Fushiguro Megumi and ma boy Yuji Itadori, oh! and can't forget abt Sukuna. 
The storyline was good but not unique, it was just another shounen plot. The curses and Jujutsu sorcerers were kind of similar to the Hollows and Shinigamis(aka soul reapers) from Bleach but that doesn't make it the exact copy of bleach... JJK has its own unique individualities. I think JJK will be a really good shounen anime in the present decade, it has already been quite popularly welcomed by anime fans though there are some who did not  like it. 
In short i would say this is an anime which is all set to be one of the best shounen anime in anime history.
If u like Shounen genres do not hesitate and go for it... even if u are not really a shounen fan u can try it out coz its quite good to be honest.",10,senpai_xx

                This Anime is probably the most overrated I know. It got good animations but this doesn't make anime always great. Majority characters are not that  interesting, some good moments are forgettable. The first 6 episodes were okay, but as the the story developed..  things move really fast. Characters come out of impossible situations and appear to have unlimited abilities.  What i most hated about this anime is the comedy, i don't get it how could you make a joke when the situation is serious especially when Yuji faced Mahito. That scene was sooo fucking mood killer and out of nowhere. If you
                  rated this 9 or 10,  you simply haven't watched the previous shounen type anime like Naruto,  Fullmetal Alchemist, Noragami, etc. Sorry to say but the anime i mentioned here is much better in almost every aspect than JJK.

                If I were to give three reasons to suggest someone Jujutsu Kaisen, it would not be for the Art, Fights or the Characters but rather it would be Gojou Satoru, Gojou Satoru and Gojou Satoru. But let's say we take Gojou Satoru out of the equation and analyze the the entire show as a whole, I'd say it's an overrated show with not that much to offer. But then again, it's just one season, and I'm being too harsh.
Don't get me wrong, I don't hate Jujutsu Kaisen. In fact, it was the anime the brought me back to the Anime Train and is leading me
                  to Otakuhood. But before I talk about the good points. I'll start by pointing out the points I found bland to say the least. First, I'll start with the protagonist Yuji Itadori. I have seen a few Shonen Anime to see that Yuji's character follows the same Shonen tropes of dumb and foolish protagonist (with the exception of Ichigo from Bleach) working hard to get to the top. And don't get me wrong, I do like that about Shonen anime because it makes the show relatable, but there are some limit to as to how dumb the protagonist could be (which is the biggest reason why people prefer Kakashi over Naruto even though he is the title character). And I find the same thing with Yuji. Let's first talk about the motives, every Shonen protagonist has a dream or something to achieve for which they put their heart and soul to it. For Naruto it is to become Hokage so that people could finally acknowledge him as a shinobi, For Luffy it is to become the number one pirate and find the treasure known as One Piece, For Goku it is to become the strongest fighter in the world, For Ichigo it is to..... But I don't find that much meaning to his motives. His motivations is to give people a proper death. What does that mean? If I compare it with the other Shonen Protagonist's motives from recent times, they have better motivations than him. For example, Deku - To be a greatest Hero like his idol All-Might; Souma - To be the greatest chef; Hinata - To lead his team to the National Levels of Volleyball despite his short height and my most favorite one Tanjiro - To cure his sister who has turned into a demon and to kill the demon responsible for his family's death [Note: I haven't seen any of the animes mentioned above (from MHA to KnY), and I only read the manga of KnY]. If I were to compare all of their motivations with Yuji's separately, it is not something that I can support wholeheartedly because I don't even know what it means.
The second thing I am gonna talk about is the ending. It's a common problem with all seasonal animes, in order to make the episode list to the exact number, sometimes they rush an entire arc worth of story which has a lot depth to it. For that particular reason, the last few episode of JJK felt rushed. If you ask me, they should have ended it on the baseball game with Kyoto Jujutsu Academy.
Now that's enough of me shitting about JJK, now let's get to the good stuff. And I hope you stayed till the end, because if you did, then good for you cause you get to see me talk about all the great stuff about JJK. First, the animation. MAPPA is the first ever animation studio I heard of ever since I came back to Anime. And to say they are amazing would be a massive understatement. Their animation is so smooth and the way they mixed 2D with 3D, I wondered whether I was reading a colored manga or watching an anime. And if I were to highlight my most favorite animation done by MAPPA on JJK, it would be the way they depicted the Negative Energy. Blue/Red flames with black lining, even though it seemed 2D, somehow my eyes weren't disturbed by it but rather appreciating it. And Yuji's Black Flash and Todou's Clap Switch deserves 10/10.
Second, the characters. I know I said that we should take Gojou out of equation if we were to analyze JJK but, when talking about the characters of JJK, you can't help but talk about Gojou. At first glance, he seems like a knock-off of Kakashi with two eyes covered instead of one and when he says that he can beat Sukuna even at his complete strength, you can't help but think he is just overestimating his own strength. But those doubts comes crashing down hard when he shows off his Domain Expansion. I'll be honest, like everyone I questioned my sexuality when my eyes met his and when he displayed a portion of his power, I was like, ""Nah bro, he is anything but a Kakashi knock-off."" And I wholeheartedly believe that this guy can fight Sukuna on equal terms. The next amazing character I'll talk about is Megumi Fushigiro. Like Gojou, I thought he was Sasuke knock-off but as I got to know him more, we started to like him in our own way. Sure, like Sasuke, he has his own past and even though we didn't got to see it much, many characters acknowledged him to be strong and we get see that when he displays his incomplete Domain Expansion. Hopefully we'll see a greater side to Fushigiro in the coming seasons. The final character I am going to mention is Sukuna. Now I have seen Naruto and I used to think that Kyubi/Kurama was not someone who'll turn a new leaf until I was proven wrong. Sukuna however is not Kurama, and the author even said that when he created characters for Sukuna and Mahito, he wanted to avoid the whole ""not completely evil"" or ""good at heart"" characters. And you know know that when you see both of them sharing the screen together and laughing at Yuji's misery. Despite all of that, he made it into my favorite charaters. And if you ask where did Yuji make it into the list? Well, I put him lower than Nobara.
The final thing I'm gonna talk about is the fights. One of the few problems with seasonal animes is that fights, don't last long. Especially when you compare it with the fights from Dragon Ball, Naruto, Bleach and One Piece which sometimes lasts over 10 episodes. That is nearly half of the entire season (almost the entire season if the number of episode is 12/13). Because of that sometimes we don't get to enjoy some legendary battle or miss out on the details that are present in the manga or light novel. However, knowing this handicaps, JJK made the most out of all their fight scenes even if it is just for 3 or 4 episodes. There wasn't a single fight scene that made me bored, rather I enjoyed all of them. Among them my favorite is  Yuji and Todo vs Hanami. It was the best fight scene I ever got to watch and it bingeworthy. I would love to describe it but I have been describing a lot of things for so long that my fingers are starting to hurt. So, I'll have to abruptly end it here. Maybe I'll mention it in one of my weekly blogs that I'm about to start. Be sure to check that out.
Thank you for taking your time and reading my analysis on JJK. If you read till the end, then good for you and if you skipped reading half of it, I literally have nothing to say because you aren't here. Well then, that's all. Soyonara!!!",8,Baka_Taku

                Why are people who make anime so obsessed with forcing comedy at all times. It's like every scene needs to have some dumb comedic element on it. Not even well thought out, the characters just say something stupid or do something idiotic and I'm supposed to laugh at that? Maybe I'd laugh the first time I see it, not the 10th time on the same episode. People are randomly talking about death and family members dying wish and here comes the main character acting like an idiot for no reason. The comedy is so out of place. What are you trying to do? Are you
                  trying to make it dark? Are you trying to make it for kids? Choose one. Because at the moment it's a clown show which fails at both. Don't get me wrong I like dark animes such as AoT or comedies such as One Punch Man. But they actually put effort into making the show dark or funny. Here they just throw in the same ""joke"" for the 20th time in the same scene. 
Same amount of effort put into the comedy as the story itself. Nothing imaginative. They don't want you to think when watching, because if you actually paid attention to this garbage, you'd realise that half the garbage is inconsistent with the story or makes no sense. You're just supposed to blindly go through with everything. If that was the case, I'd watch, but I cannot watch when every 2 seconds I've to watch a character do something insanely cringy to pass by as ""comedy"".",3,TusharV

I read Jujutsu Kaisen before it came and I can say it did not disappoint at all. The studio MAPPA really outdid themselves considering a demon show in the form of ""Kimetsu no Yaiba"" had come out previous to it.
The plot of Jujutsu Kaisen was a stand out masterpiece just like the manga version. Although it didn't include everything, it was an exciting and thrilling plot. Watching as Yuuji Itadori becomes the vessel for Ryoumen Sukuna and live life as a jujutsu sorcerer was very captivating all of the way throughout the whole season.
The art style and animation from MAPPA was incredible. Words cannot even
                  describe how amazing every fight scene and interaction was, it blew me away! They had a lot of hype to live up to and blasted through it completely. The flow and art style went extremely well together and it was just for a lack of better words, a beautiful combination.
The soundtrack, OST, and in general sound of Jujutsu Kaisen was amazing, the OSTs were ominous and really set the scene for most events in the show. The opening and ending songs for this show were also brilliant. Eve and ALI really outdid themselves as well with these amazingly composed songs for the anime. Everything came together in one piece to make it extremely enjoyable to consume as an anime.
The characters in Jujutsu Kaisen were all lovable and had personalities of their own deriving from their individual backstories. They all had in depth detailed reasons for being a jujutsu sorcerer and they were all very lovable and I look forwards to seeing a second season where I get to learn even more about them. Although I will say the one thing that made me slightly sad was Junpei Yoshino's death. I saw him during the intro of every episode and was looking forward to seeing him join Itadori on his journey as a sorcerer, but it was a plot twist, not the best, not the worst.
In general, this show was very hyped up and lived up to every single bit of it. It didn't drop the ball one time and make me want to stop watching, it kept leaving me wanting more. I highly recommend this anime to anyone wanting an anime with an amazing plot and action, this is definitely the show to watch!",10,Showgate

*Yuji is an admirable and very relatable protagonist main character. I love how he has pure heart and mellow characteristics, which as well compliments most of the characters in the story. (´｡• ω •｡`)

*Every character is well thought of as well, plus bonus to manga readers, there are so many stuff that made my heart skip a beat, from anger, sadness, happiness, fear, etc. Esp the plot twist (ノ°益°)ノ
*The Female characters are BADASSES and bonus is that they are not oversexualized. They are sexy enough because they're very independent and they fight for their places in the unfair world of jujutsu.... ヽ(♡‿♡)ノ

                I hate shounen.
It's not genre's fault though, I know. It's because shounen writers abuse its framework. You don't need to make a good story or character development if you can just pit an annoying idiot MC playing around with audience like Ultimate Beef in idiocracy, and a bunch of never revealed before the critial battle villains that cackle ominously in a battle where MC should never have a chance to survive, and just throw him a deus ex machina bone every time he gets cornered.
So I might be biased when I praise this show. Forgive me. 
It's nice because they don't make the MC a
                  chosen one teenager that becomes the strongest of the good guys 2 weeks further down the line from when the story begins, despite being le normal, gray and average high-school boy that doesn't have hobbies JUST LIKE YOU, you loser watching this.
When shit gets tough, he doesn't always get armor plot defence.
There isn't a singular EVIL Inc. that try to kill him because the EVIL Inc. CEO was bullied in school or something.
It's still shounen. There's shouting and kicking and punching, MC usually does come out on top, and he does have a DARK BLACK DEMON GOD EVIL MONARCH SEALED IN HIS RIGHT HAND gimmick going on. It is refreshing that it doesn't guide MC. It won't say ""HMPH, you use my power, so at least use it in a way that won't bring me shame! look, mortal, how you use the ULTIMATE FIST OF GALAXY DESTRUCTION properly!"". It'll mock the fuck out of MC. It'll always disappoint MCs expectations with relish, and the only thing it won't do is bait MC into relying on it, probably since it wouldn't be able to hold the laughter in.
MC isn't dumped with any expectations of saving the world either. He is just a strategically important piece that can digest dangerous shit that the human organisations couldn't do much about. And he wants to help and kick and punch while he's at it, since this is a shonen show.
It's a shonen show that respects it's viewers emotional intelligence and time, is how Id sum it up. Worthwhile to watch, imho.",7,XanWasting

                One of those anime which hasnt been spoilt by fillers. One of those anime which follows the manga at a perfect pacing and coverage. One of those anime which is worth a watch even for the manga reader.
I was reading Jujutsu kaisen, Chainsaw man and Usogui together, and well, turned out that 2 of these now have an anime. The story is great as always, and since i am writing this review on the 14th episode, the new opening has been released. Not as vibing and as good as EVE's piece of music, but yeah, still worth hearing. The art style is very good, and
                  getting better. If Trigger is the best (which it is ), jujutsu kaisen would very much be approaching it.

                First off the animation was just goddamn great, MAPPA did a great job with the fight scenes and character design. Plot was according to manga and did well explaining the storyline and fight physics. The opening by Eve was amazing but the ending was the real deal, Lost in paradise and give it back were freakin nice and closed out every episode well. The characters were well designed but I think the main characters like Yuuji, Megumi, Nobara, Gojo and Sukuna need a little bit more development. The characters were all funny and balanced each other out well. Gojo and Sukuna definitely stole everyone's heart
                  away and the iconic trio of Yuuji, Megumi and Nobara never fail to make us laugh. The fight scenes were amazing and made me go back to rewatch it a couple of times, however i would prefer that they also included more backstory for supporting characters and villains which we will hopefully see in the movie or the next season. 
Overall I think it was a masterpiece shounen and definitely one of a kind in the new gen anime. Animation and sound were great and the characters were made well and was enjoyable to watch.",10,Crazylamma

                Modern Shounen Classic in the Making
Jujutsu Kaisen has everything a great (shounen) series should have.
The Pacing is phenomenal. The series is amazing at balancing out the time it gives to every different aspect of the story, there is no time wasted, and there is no time cut short.
The world, its dynamics + the characters, and their dynamics are presented in a very unique way that reminds me of HxH, where it is grounded on reality which makes it very convincing, gripping, and immersive, incorporating the fantasy elements in a very organic/logical way. The fights are jaw-dropping and extremely creative, as is the power system itself,
                  having massive potential to be one of the best (reminds of HxH, YYH-territories, and Jojo's in this regard). The OST, OPs, EDs, and animation are all top of the line, with a production of the highest quality.
The plot is easy to follow, the story progression is intuitive and organic while also thrilling and unpredictable. Comedic moments are timed perfectly, the characters are charming, charismatic, and endearing while also consistent, and diverse.
This series is the literal definition of immense potential, the groundwork has been laid with the strongest foundations, now it's just time to keep building up to the sky. I can't wait to get more of this fantastic series",9,Damega621

                Jujutsu Kaisen: The latest animated spell of Jump
Featuring one of the most popular characters in current anime, Gojo Satoru, and one of the most pleasant contemporary EDs you could listen to on Fridays after a long and stressful week, Jujutsu Kaisen was crowned as one of the most popular anime of the 2020-21 season. Appealing to the prototypical shounen plot formula, where a high school student will end up, by chance, involved in supernatural events that will determine the survival of the human species, the anime started off on the right foot. Animated by the MAPPA studio, Jujutsu Kaisen has brought us one of the
                  most striking choreographies, character designs and animated scenes of its seasons and, undoubtedly, ended up in the eye of the global trend.
Our protagonist, the good amazing boy Itadori Yuji, will inevitably find himself alone after the death of his grandfather. An orphan boy with an amazing ability for sports and a heart of gold, he ends up as a container for a demon that could cause the end of the world inside his body. Along the way, he ends up enrolled in an institute for teenage wizards that leads him to be part of the core that makes up the holy trinity of shounen: the gold boy + the cool type boy + the genki cool girl; without forgetting, of course, the white-haired tutor in his twenties, dorky but handsome, who is cooler than a freezer.
With clear arcs of presentation of the characters, introduction of certain mysteries of the story that involve the protagonist cell, appearance of the main bad guys and their speeches, somewhat dark twists to evolve the main character or the ever-present arc of the school tournament where more characters (teachers and high school classmates) will be introduced, Jujutsu Kaisen presented us with 24 episodes that managed to position itself, deservedly, among the most acclaimed of the season. With this, after great proposals such as Dorohedoro, Dororo, Banana Fish or Sarazanmai, MAPPA continues in a good streak of premieres, despite the obvious concern of the entire community in terms of labor rights and social welfare of its workers (discussion of another topic), managing again to present a quality proposal, which engages and is received by the public with enthusiasm. 
There are several favorable points that made me follow the series, of course, plus the related variable the fact that we are in a pandemic year in which you are supposed to stay at home. I would now like to briefly elaborate on a few points:
- Potential of the story
First of all, the cast of characters presented to us by the series not only seem attractive to me from an aesthetic point of view, but they are configured as characters that may have potential for development. Some have already presented us with some fragments of pasts with doses of angst and others a brushstroke of mysteries that surround their origin and shape their ideals/goals as wizards.
Nurturing the first point, there is a clear goal to which the series aims, challenges that are configured around them and mysteries that make us want to know more about the story. One of the main questions that have me somewhat glued to the story are, ""Why on earth does Sukuna have an interest in Megumi? ""While I suspect it's because of his still mysterious origin, ability and position in the organizational structure of the wizards, it's clearly a good question that generates buy-in to the plot. Likewise, the story plays its cards right by providing clues to a plan that, for the moment, only the ultimate villain of the story knows and understands. This tactic works to capture the attention of the viewer who will seek to generate various theories around the premise.
Also, I think that another important and interesting point for the development of the plot are the ideals and discourses behind 'the demons' that are opposed to the structure of the wizards. As far as I have been able to appreciate there is a certain extreme ecological logic on the part of 'the bad guys' against humanity. I still think there would be much more nuance missing about the motivations behind reviving Sukuna again and even the possible need to develop Sukuna himself as a character from his past, giving hints and even content to his ""evil"" and power. However, it is also interesting to contrast all this with the power structure of an organization that is not shown as sacrosanct throughout the anime. The mysteries, deceptions and abuses of power within the wizards also call the institution into question. Given this, the question that comes to mind is whether the boundaries between good guys and bad guys will be relativized in this anime? It seems to me a route that could be interesting to watch and, if well handled, support the dark atmosphere and full of tragedies that this anime has already presented us.
- Action, choreography and shounen
Jujutsu Kaisen is a prolific source of material that has filled us with clips and A-1 captures. Today more than ever, I believe that shounen stake their virality (and sometimes commercial success) on the presentation of at least one top scene that makes us praise the animators and their parents for giving birth to the hands that have allowed us to witness such a tremendous animated sequence. And, indeed, I must bring to the arena that some of the top scenes of Jujutsu Kaisen are in its action sequences - usually located at the climax of some plot arcs -, which have achieved a well-deserved vitality within the community. The ability to create such an appealing visual proposal is worthy of being named in the entry and to be appreciated through the great clips it has left us.
Not only has it provided us with one scene of great climax and technical skill, but of several for each story arc presented. I have been frankly amazed with several visual proposals and with the sequences provided. I do believe, however, that the missing piece to achieve magic is a direction that manages to build the drama - adrenaline and plot-wise - to make them shine organically in the story. I think for example Kimetsu no Yaiba achieved the precise dramatic weight that contributed solvently to the story, deserving it the viralization of the story. Likewise, shounen anime such as My Hero Academia, for example, despite the various shortcomings I find in its proposal, manages to pull off great climaxes that are accompanied not only by a technical proposal at the height of that circumstance, but also by a plot and character development that mark inflections in their plots [Todoroki vs. Deku], [Bakugo vs. Deku], [Endeavor vs. Nomu]. I think that while Jujutsu Kaisen creates several technically adequate scenes, it still does not achieve that great final rush up that gives us goosebumps, the heart in our mouths and our brains racing trying to process what that scene means for the plot.
Overall, both the action choreography and the precise comic relief are quite enjoyable to watch. After all, it is a story that is presented with a high tragic and dark charge. It should be added, that while it has had some arcs that have been duller than others, such as much of the tournament arc, I won't deny that it has pulled off a story with potential and has been given the technical weight that those of us who love this world have come to expect. Although, in this first season -at least for me- it hasn't managed to break that great apotheosis barrier with some of its great scenes, I think it's highly probable that it will achieve it in its next releases.
Jujutsu Kaisen is a feast of character design and good action choreography. It has a story with potential, which is inserted within some of the various 'clichés' of shounen but with routes that are usually more associated with tragedy. After all, it is a proposal that poses a much darker atmosphere, which it tones down well by providing sequences of comic relief that are quite nice and that bring us closer to the characters. While I think it has lacked a better construction of a big climax, unlike other contemporary shounen, I think it has a good chance of achieving that last push of direction in future seasons. Anyway, it's a recommendation of its season.",8,CanAKATheIndigo

                Overall Jujutsu kaisen was kind of disappointing. Thats partially on my overly high expectations but also on surrounding hype. There was really nothing bad about the show, story although gripping and thrilling thought just didn't click, Art was soo good i was kept wandering how can a person draw this, sound was also on point. Characters were pretty basic but fun as was the overall experience. My points go to masterfully choreographed fight scenes that had you feeling the movement throught your body. it's a solid 8. If you want some classic shonen action and beautiful art this is a must watch.

                Guys, this is something special.  
The main problem with Shounen is that they're too long, too stereotypical, too packed with fillers - and nowhere near focused enough on the interesting parts of their plot.  
BUT JUJUTSU KAISEN.
Imagine my surprise when a 24 episode season felt like it flashed by and yet gave me so much to think about and love.  The characters are developed (yes, even the female lead, shocking I know!) the concept, much like demon slayer, doesn't take too much thought - the sorcerers kill the curses because the curses pose a threat to human life, and only a jujutsu
                  sorcerer is able to do this job.  But perhaps, most importantly, the best thing about this show is the protagonist.  
Now, I am by no means saying that Itadori Yuuji is the best character - that's not my personal opinion at least...  what I am saying is that JJK manages to take all the preconceptions and stereotypes of what a shounen protagonist should be, exploit them, and flip them on their head.  Yuuji is special - but not annoyingly so.  He's not a child of legend, and he's not destined to do anything; his choices directly lead to the path he takes - stemming from his grandfather's final wish.  He has guts, motivation and humour, and I'll be damned if the show doesn't make you root for him.  
Megumi too, the deuteragonist (or second protagonist depending on what interpretation of the show you're looking at) is immensely interesting.  He's definitely not a sidekick but he's not necessarily a rival either - he compliments Yuuji's determination perfectly with his own self-doubt, he doesn't ever come to resent Yuuji but that doesn't mean he's never jealous of him, not to mention the responsibility he feels for thrusting Yuuji into this world.  They help each other grow as people and as sorcerers, but they are not dependent on each other.  It's a perfect balance of yin and yang.  
Another decision I praise is Gojo being the power ceiling.  Although he would insist otherwise - noone will be able to outdo Gojo in the Jujutsu world, and that's a good thing.  We see the extent of cursed energy through Gojo's abilities and the magic and techniques are proportional to what we know is possible.  We are satisfied with the outcomes of battles because the world follows it's own rules and we understand the magic system enough for the payoff of new skills and techniques learnt by the students to make logical sense (so we feel like we're learning too!)
All in all, this is a triump of modern Shounen Anime and Anime in general that deserves all the hype.  What are you waiting for?",10,liliannexx
40748,"
                Based on the popular supernatural adventure shounen manga series written by Gege Akutami, Jujutsu Kaisen features users of cursed energy called Jujutsu Sorcerers who are tasked of exorcising Curses, spiritual beings manifested from the negative emotions of living beings. High school student Yuji Itadori finds himself unwillingly pulled into this supernatural world when his school’s Occult Research Club comes into possession of one of the fingers of a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna that attracts other Curses when unsealed. Yuji becomes a host to Sukuna after eating the finger, but is still able to retain control of his body in spite of the Curse’s power.
                  This leads him to become a student of the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of powerful Jujutsu Sorcerer, Satoru Gojo, where Yuji learns to manifest his use of cursed energy and aid in gathering all of Sukuna’s remaining fingers before being exorcised.
Jujutsu Kaisen’s story and characters are largely pretty standard as far as shounen titles go. A number of the plot threads within the series such as a school for folks with special abilities to be trained, fighting against spiritual-like evil beings, a pact-like relationship with the male lead and the suppressed evil within him, and a tournament arc are par the course for titles aimed at the demographic. Same deal goes for many of the characters introduced who each have their character types they largely stick with throughout Jujutsu Kaisen such as nice guy Yuji, the overly serious Megumi, brash and short-fused Nobara, and the overpowered yet playful Gojo. The anime does attempt to provide back story on many of its characters to flesh them out. But in many instances, it has a bad habit of doing this during the middle of heated battles and while introducing many more characters during Jujutsu Kaisen’s mentioned tournament arc, which makes many of these back stories lack any impact since the series is trying to introduce as many characters as possible within such a limited number of episodes. The comedy attempted by the series is also typical shounen in that it gets rather over-the-top and obnoxious coming from the more irksome elements of the quirks of the characters, sometimes having the bad habit of popping up during the title’s more serious scenes.
This said though, Jujutsu Kaisen did have some highlights for me. Many of the anime’s action scenes were quite engaging to see animated, being a visual spectacle with the various abilities demonstrated by the characters from grounded melee combat to more large-scale abilities such as those demonstrated by Gojo. The series does also have its effective moments with conveying the more darker elements of its storytelling such as the violent aftermaths depicted of Curse attacks and the grotesque designs of some Curses seen. Some of the villains in the series also come off convincingly threatening due to their abilities, manipulations, or very nature; notable instances include Sukuna, Mahito, and Geto. Sadly though, the current plot within the series involving Jogo and the Disaster Curses aligned with him is left unresolved due to its manga source material still ongoing as of this review.
In short, Jujutsu Kaisen is mostly pretty typical fare as far as shounen adventure titles go in terms of characters, comedy, and storytelling formulas. It does have its engaging elements such as its action scenes and some effective elements coming from the darker aspects of its storytelling with mood, Curse designs, and the actions of some of its major villains. But I feel this series would be more a treat for fans of the typical storytelling mold of shounen titles, as I didn’t feel there was enough to the series that made a big impression on me beyond its action scenes and parts of its darker story elements.",6,ggultra2764
40748,"
                Jujutsu Kaisen is a great show that revolves around cursed energy. The first episode was really jam packed and definitely sold the show to me. There are 24 episodes in total for S1 however the first half of the series definitely seemed to flow better story-wise, than the later half.
Itadori Yuji is a high school boy who’s grandfather recently passes away leaving him with the following final words, “you are a strong kid, help people whenever you can”. He comes across a cursed object which happens to be a finger of the king of curses, Sukuna. Not being able to control the cursed energy from
                  the item, his schoolmates are put in a life threatening situation. 
The finger feeds off cursed spirits around it, so in order to help and thinking back to what his grandfather says, he eats the finger to gain power, but instead becomes somewhat of a host/vessel for Sukuna as he is able to control/switch out with the curse. Gojo a jujutsu sorcerer who is seeking the fingers tells Yuji that he can choose to be executed now or can be accept death later on after collecting all the fingers. Yuji agrees on the decision to be killed once all fingers are collected as he wants to fulfil his his grandfather’s last wish of helping others. From this he is recruited into Jujutsu High School.
The 3 first years Yuji who has just been recruited, Nobara, and Megumi are working their way to be able to refine their powers and techniques to exorcise curses, with Gojo as their teacher. This main group of people are very entertaining and personalities are extremely likeable. Other characters such as Nanamin, Toge, and Maki etc are introduced which also have very unique traits and abilities. (Thank you for making strong female characters!) For me personally Megumi stood out to me the most, I really like his cool yet fragile personality and as soon as he summoned those precious doggos, I was like that’s it, that’s my favourite boy right there. 
Besides the curse living inside Itadori, Mahito is seen as the main antagonist for this part of the story. His manipulative tendencies, playing with human emotions and childish behaviour is what makes him a good villain I suppose. I kinda wish we saw more of Sukuna because he was pretty much the main focal point for the first part of the show and then later only appears for like a few seconds. There are other characters which aren’t properly introduced in the anime so I feel like anime only watchers maybe confused (I started to read the manga to get a better understanding). 
The animation itself stands out very well, very high quality, literally crisp and clean, (Thank you Mappa!) even the opening and ending credits are unique and memorable which definitely deserves an applause. (I missed listening to KaiKai Kitan and Lost in Paradise in the second half T-T) I could go on an on but I don’t want to give away too much, this is something you definitely have to experience, so just go watch it please!  
Overall I feel like this is a great anime for this generation, there’s a little bit of everything such as emotional scenes, fight scenes, fillers which helps relax the pacing, and funny moments especially the Juju Strolls at the end of each episode. It’s suitable for anyone to jump in and watch. I also heard that there will be a movie coming out too so can’t wait for that.",9,SUMERA_16

                I don't get the hype around this. It was boring to watch, the characters were not engaging or likeable. I found nothing redeeming about it. 
The animation is done well, but everything else about it is cookie-cutter and bland.
The protagonist is just an unlikable dufus with an uninspiring motivation that has no depth to it. No time is taken to establish why he should even care. 
Senpai is just OP for no particular reason. The rules of the world are never explained. 
It was more fun watching Tohru go shopping for the 10th time. They do nothing in this show to get you invested in

Now the only thing which kind of disappoints me is its characters don't get me the wrong the main character are all very good and Gojou Satoru, Itadori Yuuji, Megumi, Nobara but other than the main characters i cant really seem to feel for the others even the antagonist of the story i cant seem find his motivation to do certain things, its basically like im a bad guy i do bad things. 
ENJOYMENT : 10
To be honest a shounen anime is basically about the journey and the excitement it brings to you and Jujutsu Kaisem has done a pretty amazing job and because of this i definitely recommend this anime to all of you.

Did you ever feel like watching the same anime all over again? Well, I had this feeling with both Naruto, Boku no Hero, Black Clover, and Jujutsu Kaisen.
I dislike this anime, not because it is bad, but it's just a plain ripoff of Naruto, even the same team, Itadori being the over-positive guy who doesn't care about risks, Megumi being that employed, and Nobara being the dislikable girl that does nothing but being useless. (I don't even have to mention SaitamaxKakashi)
A guy who fights for a right death, that's a cool line if you pay no attention to how Itadori kills demons
                  that were once alive while having fun screaming his powers, I will start with what I think it's good and then I'll move into the cons.
Pros:
-Megumi's character development is very noticeable since the beginning of the anime, it is probably the only character that has a remarkable development.
-Aoi Toudou.
-Both animation and art are just plain amazing, followed by an amazing soundtrack, that combination makes this anime so easy to see.
-Sukuna being one of the best villains in shonen, even after he's an Orochimaru ripoff, Sukuna character plays very well the antagonist role, saving Itadori with the only restriction to spectate the best character, then refusing to help even after Itadori is willing to give his body, and for me the best scene, Sukuna showing how he's superior to other devils at the fight with Mahito.
Cons:
-Itadori is just a pointless overpowered character whose only restriction is Sukuna, who never puts a restriction on him lol.
-Gojou is what you would get if you insert a Deus Ex Machina in a shonen that tries to create a tense mood for fights, just like in OPM, whenever a fight looks hard you know who's going to show up.
-Sukuna fingers are just Akatsuki kyuubi's hunt.
-Sukuna is just Kurama.
-Nobara does nothing, she has useless abilities and her personality is gross.
-The anime ends with literally everyone getting ascended to the highest class, like just an incredibly exaggerated time skip to avoid training any character, at least Megumi is justified since it's said that he's a prodigy who's been training his entire life, but the rest are just, damn.
Overall this anime can be incredibly amazing for people who have never seen Naruto, I understand it, but if you did, then this anime is just a complete ripoff and a bad one.",5,xSnowDragon

                First of all, I'm talking for now (1-8th episode).
I already recommend it. First what it talks about and the story is pretty unique I really enjoy it. The art is very good and the kanji (curses and all) is amazing. Considering how hard it is to write some kanji but LOOK at those like wow I love the art in this shonen.
The music is good, the least that I heard is good so far.
The characters are fine. Not to complain but some are kinda basic. The guys that never went to tokyo and acts like fans of the city blabla, it's a bit tiring ngl.
The
                  story is good. There's already some mystery and it's making me curious so I consider the story so far so good haha. Itadori is well introduced same goes to the other characters except the director of the school. I'm a bit disappointed on how they just showed him only when Itadori needed to. Considering how their professor is strong they should also show the strenght of their director (imo).
Anyways, Looking forward to the next episodes I recommend!",7,melody_04

                This was your typical shounen anime, nothing out of the ordinary. Yet I still gave it a 9, why? 
First of all, there was the music, the music in this anime from start to finish was just amazing.
Then there were the fights which didn't stand out in any way but just gave me this special feeling. I enjoyed them more than I should but the fact remains I really enjoyed them.
Finally, you have the art and the story which were just good. You wouldn't watch Jujutsu Kaisen for the art nor for the story, but you would appreciate both once you start watching.
With shounen anime,
                  there is a particular route to follow (like having a tournament arc, protagonist growing stronger, ...) and Jujutsu Kaisen did that without fail and even managed to add its own flair to it. Overall this was a 9 for me, maybe I'm overhyping a little but like I said the fact remains I really enjoyed Jujutsu Kaisen.",9,Halil-0402

                - This review may contain minor spoilers -
Jujutsu Kaisen is a very popular anime, so after hearing many people recommend it, I decided to give it a shot. I think the show started out strong, but I felt like the characters were starting to seem more and more flat as the show progressed, and the different missions felt repetitive and boring. Not much interesting happened. If I would try to think about what did interest me, it would be the beginning of the story, when Junpei was introduced, and maybe even Fushiguro's backstory in the end. But, all in all, I felt pretty bored, and
                  I would likely not watch this show again.
Story (6): I thought the story was interesting in the beginning, but as the story continued, I was starting to feel bored. Itadori's mindset intrigued me, but the other characters' backstories felt difficult to relate to and flat. I couldn't really relate to the characters, so I didn't really care about them. I liked that the plot was unique, tho, but that was as far as it went.
Art (10): Apart from all the other aspects of the show, the art was outstanding. Jujutsu Kaisen's art and animation is one of the best I've seen among all the anime I've watched. The art really made it easier to finish the show. But even though the art was amazing, it couldn't save the quality of the show, in my eyes.
Sound (9): Damn, the first OP and ED were total bangers. I still have Lost in Paradise in my head because it was so good. The second OP was also pretty good, but the ED was just kinda good. The soundtrack throughout the series was also good!
Character (6): I liked the characters. Everyone had differing, unique and original personalities and appearances. The main male characters were very attractive. But their backstories couldn't make me feel for them, or only a little bit. I felt sad when Junpei died, and felt a little sad during Fushiguro's backstory, but that was it. I couldn't really relate or feel for any of the other characters' backstories, which made them feel shallow.
Enjoyment (6): It was enjoyable in the beginning, but as it continued, I could feel myself getting more and more bored. The art made it bearable.
Overall (6): All in all, Jujutsu Kaisen was ""Fine"". I wouldn't say it was a ""Bad"" show. But I wouldn't watch it again. It was kind of boring and shallow.
Well, that was it for this review.",6,ciaovatos

                I have never wrote a review on MAL since my join in 2015 but I felt like I want to express how much I enjoyed this show.
I'm a huge fan of shounens, yeah I know it is actually a silly genre sometimes but I grew up on DragonBall Z and Naruto. Since Naruto Shippuuden I didn't get attached to shounen I enjoyed Fairy Tail, My Hero Academy but I missed something, yet during this year I've got two extremely good shounens one is of course Jujutsu Kaisen and the other is Demon Slayer.
I feel like I get everything in these two, really great actions, truly
                  enjoyable characters, nice animation and yeah great humour. Sometimes shounen tends to overdo ""funny"" things in amines but in my opinion in Jujutsu you get the great amount of fun while you enjoy the rest of the things.
It certainly not a masterpiece but I hope it will get a long run because it is so enjoyable, a series that you won't regret to watch!",9,TayBee

                This is a fast paced, fun and exciting watch! The only thing that's kind of lacking imo is the world building because for the fast story telling the world building is rather slow and to this point there's still a lot of background information missing. For me personally the characters and their developement is what makes this anime superb! There isn't even one single character I despise which is rather seldom - but this is a personal thing. 
If you want to see some intrigued animation mixed with some thrilling characters: this anime is for you - if you haven't seen it already since it's

                SIMPLE NON SPOILER REVIEW
Best First season for a modern Shounen anime no debate (and yes even better then Demon Slayer but not by much)
The most outstanding parts this anime has to offer are it's characters and animation. 
The story itself isn't unique but it's done far better then my hero academia and such just by how entertaining it is. The entire roster of characters are loveable. 
There is no character you will end up hating which is something you won't see in Demon Slayer or My hero academia where characters are sometimes barely bearable to watch or just flat out ignored for the entire season
                  after their use is done. 
The Sound design is really good although not something to the level of anime such as attack on titan. (The soundtrack is a bop)
 ANIMATION is absolutely amazing, I can't stress enough how fluid the fight sequences are and with such detail.

                I think this is my first review on this site.  I've been hesitant to review any shows because it seems like people go into great depth to rate each aspect of the show.  I decided to review this show because its the first show in quite a while that's so good that I can't wait for the next episode.  This anime has it all - great story, unique characters, great artwork, great dialog.  Its really fun to watch.  The one thing that annoys me is that every episode is a cliffhanger, but at the same time, every episode does move

                If I had the option to explain this anime in one word, it would be Monologing.
It. is. painful.
I cannot express this enough how much the word monolog is on overkill. It actually really ruined most of the fight scenes for me and made it really hard to enjoy the anime.
The characters are not especially memorable and the main story is a very recycled plot that could have been handled better. Hell, Sakuna is the most interesting character and he barely carries his roll out through out the story so far.
Now, I haven't gone out of my way to read the manga and given that I
                  sat down to watch this series twice (cause I didn't like it the first time and wanted to try and give it another go)? It just isn't palatable enough for me to endure.
The Aoi Todo and Juji Itadori part was cool and the end of series battle was all that really kept my attention since Sakuna gets sidelined the whole time.

The opening song and ending song is very addictive. the starting is okay and its not complex so its easy for people to understand what's going on. the animation is god tier so no complains there. the story continues nicely without any major plot twists or anything which kind of made the show predictable.
the sound effects of the curses are superb it actually gave me a chill for a sec too. [ all of these are my

First anime that got me laugh for a while... finally an anime that has ""modern"" humor in it. I'm glad they didn't use that old TV humor style as other animes do and I like that they aware of their own genre and stick to that with their jokes and storylines.

                If Satoru Gojo was given a physical form in our world, humanity would go extinct after fifty years because no one would ever experience attraction to anyone other than him and I'm pretty sure Infinity is a sterilizer.
While I could write a full review of Gojo alone, I assume most of you are here to hear about the actual series. One thing I probably don't have to tell you is that it's one of the best of its kind. While I would struggle to call it my all-time favorite anime, it is almost certainly the one I would give the honor of ""objective best"".
Let's start
                  with what's only good; the story. Like I said, it is still good, but it's quite similar to Demon Slayer's but is carried out without the same slow pacing that made the latter's arguably great. In fact, almost everything in this show can be directly or indirectly compared to Demon Slayer - only difference is this one's way better, and I'll tell you why.
First of all, even though there are a few crying fits in this show, I should reiterate that there are only a few. Not the roughly 20 that are in Demon Slayer S1 alone. Secondly, despite both of these shows being action-oriented with goofy characters and slapstick humor present, the mood whiplash endured at the hands of Demon Slayer is reduced to near non-existence, because unlike DS, JJK rarely takes itself seriously. Because of this, this show manages to be a comedic riot instead of an annoying soy boy spectacular.
Going beyond that to what is spectacular, the animation is unbelievably fluid and while roughly on par with DS's it ends up looking much more vibrant through its use of sharp contrast rather than blends of color. The design of all of the landscapes and characters is nothing standard, but through every character's unique abilities they are given what feels like a second level of life.
Speaking of characters, each and every one of them is personable and distinguished, even the ones that seem stuck-up from the start, to such a degree that even some of the side characters are equally or more likeable than Yuji himself. Especially Gojo.
Gojo is essentially what the God of an Atheist religion would look like, except his existence is not derived of hatred and edge; instead, he's just fun. Oh yeah, and seriously overpowered. Most even remotely familiar with him or JJK as a whole know about the masterpiece that is the Infinite Void scene, and I would say that it is the single most triumphant scene of any televised series I've ever watched to completion.
Overall, this anime manages to succeed where everything else failed and stands above the rest as the best anime of the 2020s by far. If you haven't seen it yet, you aren't just missing out on anime: you're missing out on fun itself.",10,TwistedTempest23

                I don’t know what the folks at Mappa are doing but keep up the good work!
If I am to be blunt about this... Jujutsu Kaisen is a genuinely refreshing take when it comes to battle Shounen. At first glance, it may appear to have the characteristics of other mainstream shounen, but its execution is different. Just because Itadori is a vessel doesn’t make him a Naruto rip-off, and just because Gojo has a mask, it doesn’t make him a Kakashi rip-off either (Honestly comparing it to Naruto is a poor comparison, I am not sure about Bleach though as I haven't watched/ read it yet)
It
                  is unique in the sense that things aren’t usually exaggerated, there is a concentrated amount of subtly in the personalities of the characters as well as their dialogues. Morality is brought out a lot, and as you must've seen in the dialogues of the characters, it is presented differently. 
....Consider Fushigoro’s brilliant monologue in the 5th episode and then its extension in the second last episode, the anime isn’t trying to slap basic morality on our faces. The characters think, and they have their own convictions. 
The protagonist Itadori doesn't have a Grandeur goal of becoming a revolutionary figure. He just wants to follow his conviction of saving as many people as he can, because, within him, he holds the power to do so. 
Granted, his convictions were put into question when he came face to face with the reality of what he was dealing with, it further enforced his convictions, and he realized that ideals are nothing more than ideals. He can never save everyone, that's why it's so important to save everyone he can.   
Plus, unlike the standard, we don’t have an overly dramatic pervert, or any hardcore simps (Please don’t Lump the Chad that is Todou into the category of hardcore Simps)
Neither are the female characters sexualized for the sake of fanservice. Bro, the female characters rock, their personalities defy the usual tropes and they are so likable. 
Furthermore, we have a PANDA. If anything, this alone reinforces the fact that Jujutsu Kaisen is a refreshing take!
...and the comedy is passable as well. I like how they put the subjective comedy at the end of the episode, you can just choose if you are in the mood or not (Sometimes it's good: Whenever there's the Panda)
I’d say, I was genuinely surprised to see a battle shounen being executed so nicely. The studio made full use of everything they had, they were able to bring out the strengths of the story as well as makeup for its weaknesses. I am so looking forward to their adaption of Chainsaw man. 
As it stands, Jujutsu Kaisen is still in its earliest stages so the story is still in the process of establishing a solid foundation for the plot to move on. 
There were events that could've been executed with more diligence, so I am not saying it's perfect, and the fandom may exaggerate on its strong points... but, Jujutsu Kaisen is still a brilliantly executed Shounen, and one that deserves the attention it is getting. 
Also, I applaud the author for introducing a character like Todou... You have my respect.",8,ChibiTalha
40748,"
                I wanted to love Jujutsu Kaisen - and I got close! Despite the exceptional animation, the (few) lovable characters (looking at you, Gojo Satoru), and the delightful sound design and soundtrack, the story and characters were ultimately so disappointing to me that these strengths couldn't quite compensate for them.
What I loved about this show I've already listed above. The best thing about this show is definitely the animation. From the start it is obvious that the animation quality of this show is on another level, and it only gets better as the show progresses (thinking of Itadori & Todo vs Hanami, specifically). While I found
                  most of the cursed spirits designs to be a bit awkward, that didn't necessarily detract from the experience. And, besides, these are cursed spirits after all.
And I did mention that there were a few lovable characters. Gojo Satoru is delightful for reasons that I struggle to elucidate. He is charming and mysterious, but also kind in a way that could be surprising for one with his power. I also adored the character of Itadori Yuji, though I understand the complaint that he is just another of your generic, thick headed shonen protagonists. I still found him delightful, and I found his relationship with his grandfather and how that experience motivated him and inspired his path and his relationships to be refreshing. It was also interesting to see how that initial seed of motivation was challenged and evolved over the show, and by the end of the season we see him motivated to not only protect and care for those he loves, but also to do those things for himself. Though the growth might have at times felt awkward, it was always intersting.
But really, that's about it. The rest of the characters, however entertaining, felt mostly hollow. The moments where they did explore more of the backstories of several of the characters felt really awkward and out of place (I'm thinking specifically of the School Exchange arc). Todo was the rare example in the show where the comedy landed for me, but I found the rest of the Kyoto school cast to be dull and uninteresting (with the exception of Miwa, maybe).
The story and the ""internal logic,"" if you will, of the show also frustrated me. I was never quite sure what the direction of the story was. Were we trying to get all of Sukuna's fingers to feed them to Itadori? But then what would happen? Wouldn't that just allow Sukuna to overpower Itadori? Why would Gojo want that? Of course, maybe with his power and knowledge Gojo knows something that we don't, but I found it hard to invest in the story without a better understanding of what the objective was. And maybe that's fine - you invest for the characters and for them fighting for each other. I also found the motivations of the cursed spirits shallow. Their motivations basically come down to cursed spirits being better than humans so all humans should die, and that's it. It creates a really black and white dynamic that is tired and boring.
I also was exhausted by all of the explanations of how cursed energy/power/spirits work and the various grading of sorcerers and spirits. Not because I didn't care to try to understand, but because it kept being presented in such an inconsistent and incoherent manner that I had to give up trying to keep track. I felt like Itadori after Gojo explained how cursed energy works - I didn't catch any of it. 
And maybe it doesn't matter. If nothing else, the animation was beautiful, the soundtrack was great, and the few characters I did enjoy made it an entertaining ride. Despite my complaints, I'm eagerly looking forward to more Jujutsu Kaisen, though I worry how the fragile foundation of the story will hold up for future seasons/movies. But, regardless, I'm looking forward to seeing what's next.",7,greygansey

                First off: Have not the manga. So remember that when reading my review.
The art is amazing. MAPPA is killing it lately.
Although fighting scenes are never something that grabs me or changes my opinion on a show the fight scenes in this series IS pretty creative and entertaining.
However... I cannot for the life of me understand why so many people are in love with this show. It's incredibly generic. A lot of similar themes to other popular anime such as Blue Exorcist. The 2nd and 3rd year class characters just don't interest me. I don't care about the little bit of their back story that has
                  been presented. I can't quite explain it. But I just care about the 3 first years and Gojou. And the main plot of the cursed spirits. Which I do find interesting. It's the in between stuff that this show drags some times. I feel like this show (this season) could be 12-13 episodes. 24 is just too much filler for a show like this.
I know. I know. I have probably made many of you angry. But I don't care. I like the show. But I think it's INSANELY overrated.",7,NenHancer
40748,"
                Jujutsu Kaisen ended up for me as another run of the mill shounen anime.
The beginning seemed promising, but the series quickly fell into the pitfalls of the genre. The action is great but ruined at times by lots of explanatory monologuing.
Characters are rather one dimensional, and the tone of the storytelling is all over the place (Moving from serious to comedy way too quick)
In terms of positives the worldbuilding was great, the animation is fantastic, and characters such as Sukuna and Gojo are really unique and interesting. 
However without a grounded emotional story to accompany the journey, it falls flat for me. If you can
                  overlook the negatives, you will love the art and action.
6/10 from me, but shounen lovers should give it a watch.",6,Ji-ire
40748,"
                Jujutsu Kaisen was the biggest surprise for me, anime wise, in 2020. I initially didn't think i would like the show since the first 3 or so episodes did not grab me. It wasnt until Episode 4 and 5 that i was hooked and wanted to know what happens next.
The anime as a whole was just downright enjoyable, from the music, the action, the characters and the tone it all felt familiar but fresh at the same time.  The show had a way of keeping you on your toes and raising the stakes of what was taking place so that even if you had
                  an idea of how things would pan out, things would rarely go exactly as you imagined. Each week i looked forward to the next episode, and each week i wasn't disappointed. I think its in the show's favor that there wasnt really any filler episodes this season, so everything kept moving at an exciting pace.
If i had to point out a 'weak' aspect of the show i guess i could nitpick towards the story since, although i think its good its nothing we havnt seen before. However i think the characters shine and through your investment in their struggles and triumphs the story doesnt glare as much as it could. I will say though that a crucial aspect of the story, that being Sukuna, kind of gets relegated to the background fairly quickly in the show to the point where you kind of forget about him. I thought that was quite odd.
Overall though Jujutsu Kaisen i feel was Great and i can't wait to see the next season of it.

                Honestly I believe it's too early to rate anything above an 8. The pacing was really nice and it wasn't all over the place like I've seen with these kind of 24 episode anime. It was really enjoyable, there wasn't a second I wasn't on the edge of my seat waiting for the next scene. The fight scenes were so good, amazingly animated. My only issue is the power scaling. I don't understand where any of them stand in terms of power. I can't tell who is super strong or who is super weak. They all seem relatively as strong as one another. Maybe I'm
                  looking way in to depth about it, but it didn't make any sense at all. Also how Itadori is a vessel for Sukuna. I like Sukuna, but why doesn't he just take over his body and use him like it seems he could. They made one pact, but it didn't seem like it meant much in the anime. Still pretty enjoyable though.",8,EchoDied
40748,"
                I don't really write reviews but i will write one for jujutsu.
Jujutsu kaisen doesn't have the deepest story in the history of anime, some people say that it is predictable. Maybe to an exstent yeah, it is predictable. However it being predictable, isn't unique to jujutsu. In my opinion almost every shounen anime is predictable. Also it is still a good story, simple and quite decent. It doesn't make it any less enjoyable for being simple.
Now art is a 100 out of 10; very good understanding of coloring and shading, brilliant art style, the smoothest animation ever. In most animes action scenes are probably the
                  easiest to make because they generally use camera movements etc. Jujutsu doesn't do that, every action scene smells like extreme budget to me. I respect it so much. For my personal taste, i prefer art styles like kimetsu no yaiba's. But the art is so good that it still is quite eye candy to me.
I know that amongst some anime fans, not watching anime with good story just because of the art style is disliked. But if the art style just stabs me in the eye, i might not like it. Jujutsu is the exact opposite of that, the animation makes it really pleasing to watch.
Soundtrack isn't as good as Devilman Crybaby, which is top tier, but i think it needs credit. Because especially for Gojo's fights the soundtrack used makes you really hyped and fits the fight quite well.
Extremely good ambience is quite rare in anime, this animes ambience is fine but nothing extraordinary.
Characters aren't deep and some people are salty because of that but i don't think the characters are bad at all. Especially Maki, Nobara and Toudou seems to be really interesting characters. Characters still have their unique characteristics and almost all of them are f*cinkg cool.
What i love about jujutsu is that they didn't make women useless and moe like in most shounens (maybe pretty much any anime)
What i think could be better is Yuuji, i love Yuuji. He is funny, kind and a classic shounen protag. However i really wished he could be a bit deeper, like how Megumi and Nobara is.
I enjoyed watching it quite a lot, especially the art style did it for me. I honestly waited for the next episode with exictement. I love the mix of comedy and seriousness that goes on. 
Overall is 10 out of 10, yes i am a bit generous with this. I mostly gave it because of the art style. It is out standing but it may not be a masterpiece. However i believe that almost anyone can enjoy this anime. Many people seem to rate this ridiculously low just because the story isn't deep, i don't think those people like shounen at all. If deep plot is a must for you, i might not recommend it.
It is an amazinng anime! Deserves to be one of the best shounens.",10,ZeiZeyn

                Jujutsu Kaisen
The ""hype"" is rarely actually accurate. And with this anime adaptation, I can even understand him completely.
JJK offers a very well-known setting around the usual Japanese ghosts, exorcism, and the whole fighting-shounen load with almost all possible standards and clichés.
To my surprise, however, the author tried to avoid it in the best possible way and to show the clichés from the best of sides, which worked out well. Not only in terms of characters and dialogues, but also in terms of the storyline.
It's questionable if it's just me, but to me, this work seemed like a combination of ""Gintama Humor"", ""Jojo"" fighting style, and
                  some plot fragments from ""Fullmetal Alchemist"". If this is really the case, then at least the inspiration is chosen correctly.
The manga is unknown to me, but if you expect something like a deep or far-reaching story in the first season, you won't find anything. This season is mostly devoted to introducing many characters, the system, the world, and the structure of the various groups.
Concerning the main plot, there was nothing particularly individual or surprising except for a single result. As already mentioned, it is a very typical Shounen process.
What I can say positively is the satisfactory attempt to create a power system with different approaches and techniques. This gives the topic a nice finishing touch. Unfortunately, there seems to be a big problem with power scaling, at least in the first season. It is unclear whether this will be explained later, but the characters' powers fluctuate far too irregularly. The protagonist is already a superman without his powers. Most characters are already challenged by level 2 ghosts but can then fight against special level appearances without illustration. As a result, you lose a certain feeling of how strong your opponents are or whether the current Jujuzist ranking is incorrect.
To my surprise, the characters are quite positive. Not in the sense of development or profound personality, but of their sympathetic characteristics.
Among other things, this team reminds me enormously of the structure, of Team 7 from Naruto. Only this time better implemented.
The protagonist Yuji is the usual naive hollow head as we know him, but as lovable sunshine and not as a pain in the ass.
Megumi is arguably the most profound of the characters and has some approaches and understandable monologues.
The female protagonist Atsuya is very personable and definitely one of the best female protagonists I've seen so far. I hope, however, that it stays that way and that it is given some depth.
On the part of the supporting characters I hardly have anything to complain about, they are the usual standard apart from Gojo. This guy is quite mysterious and personable. Each of his appearances has a certain charm.
The antagonists of the series, at least the familiar ones, haven't shown much so far. But what you clearly saw is how much the author tried to give them individuality. And he succeeded (apart from the clichés). Especially the way they hold their meetings made me grin every time. The typical ""evil circle of the bitterly bad"" does not exist here.
I also found the smaller details positive and the fact that the conversations between the characters were refreshing rather than forced. This also made their connections to each other much more appealing and realistic.
Regarding the animations, I can hardly say anything, Mappa has shown how far they can go. In practically every episode there was a very nice display of her abilities as an animator. Most of the time, some episodes almost seemed like art for the eye.
Musically, JJK has been very individual about the Osts, at least by the new standards. The intros and outros are mostly average, at least musically. Regarding the animation of the intros, you can't say anything, this borders on perfection.
Jujutsu Kaisen is definitely not a revolutionary title. With so many chewed-through approaches, you can hardly stand out from the crowd. However, the best was brought out here with individuality, on the part of the process and the characters.
The first season of JJK has clearly been a fairly enjoyable prologue. Definitely one of the works with greater potential.

                If you think this is just ""another generic shounen"" you are completely wrong. 
Jujutsu Kaisen Completely Surpassed my expectations and changed my views of anime as a whole
Story: Jujutsu Kaisen is darker than any other shounen jump i've watched. It's themes and tones are mature and complex, and the story is full of fast paced, almost non-stop action, that never sacrifices emotional depth. Even if the first few episodes deceive you into thinking this is Bleach 2.0, it is certainly NOT. 
Art: It would be a 10/10 for Gojo's beautiful eyes alone.
Every episode is a sakuga showcase. The occasional dazzling hand to hand choreography that
                  drew me to Naruto is present in every episode. The cursed techniques are colorful and explosive, the action is dynamic and fluid. Also the character designs are sick as hell.
Characters: I'll focus on my three favorites of JJK's phenomenal cast. 
Yuji Itadori has the same core personality of many shonen protagonist which made me dismiss him initially. But the real emotions he displays and suffering he goes through flesh him out into a real and interesting protagonist. He's a cheerful fun loving teenager, yet he is forced to go through great trauma which eclipses the pain of most other protagonists, giving added layers of maturity to the series. 
Gojo Satoru is also a stand out character, who despite resembling Kakashi on a surface level could not be more different in personality. Besides being hilarious in every comedy scene (comedy being another strength of the series) Gojo exudes arrogance and disdain for the older generation of sorcerers. He hates the conservative establishment and seeks to educate a more progressive youth which enriches the series with political themes. 
Sukana being both the main villain and the main characters ""inner demon"" is a necessary subversion of tropes. Where Kurama, Hollow Ichigo, and others merely manifest their rage through the main characters, often powering them up in the process, Sakuna actively hurts Yuji at every turn. He's by no means the kind of demon which can be befriended. 
Sound: memorable tracks enhance the fight scenes and the Openings and endings are super catchy.
Enjoyment: The Comedy of Grand Blue, the emotions of Hunter X Hunter, the Animation quality of Fate/Zero, JJK easily captured my heart for an immeasurably enjoyable time. 
Overall JJK made me realize that the tropes present in most shounen can continue to be subverted or improved upon in meaningful ways. My view towards other series improved as well, as I am now more willing to enjoy their strengths and keep an open mind. 10/10 Masterpiece for sure",10,Orangutan999
40748,"
                So far, I'm completely sold on the world of Jujutsu Kaisen. The animation, sound, and attention to detail in every scene really make it easy to fall into the world of Jujutsu Kaisen. Technically its one of the most visually stunning anime I've come across in a long while, and if anything should be praised for the production it puts forth into the industry and looked at for shonen anime who want their combat scenes to feel impactful and dynamic.
Story so far leaves some to be desired sure, a lot of us have been spoiled with so called literary masterpieces that I'm personally always craving
                  for a story to give me just a little more to hold onto. That being said, I think it's fine for 13 episodes in considering it's GENRE. It's a shonen, and all we need for a story to get started SOMEWHERE. Give a character a reason to fight, then force that character to care about what they're fighting for. And with the last few episodes I really believe they did that! With showing just how truly evil curses are, after trying to humanize them. I would have loved more time with a certain titular character and Yuuji, but if it was such a deal breaker I'd have read the manga first.
Characters can seem tropey at times, I'm overlooking that a little bit as someone who can enjoy a character who fits a certain mold from time to time. Despite them having similar feels to other characters from history, the world Jujutsu Kaisen creates is unique and interesting enough that they have their own feel apart from other media we might have seen those characters in.
All in all, while it seems like I'm giving a mediocre anime too much credit in the story and character departments, they do ENOUGH. It's a fun shonen anime, let it have fun shonen tropes, let it impress you with its monsters, let these characters be tropes for a while and let them break out of the mold by following a developing story. Many shonen protagonists began here, or in an even worse spot and in time we grew to love them. Jujutsu Kaisen is only starting give it a break and let's buckle up for the ride.
NOW FOR THE ANIMATION AND SOUND!?!?!?! I literally cannot stop talking about how great this anime is, and how it just decides to break what rules of animation we're used to for the sake of impact and atmosphere. Combat scenes are so well scripted and animated, and brings me back to a time before anime was here's my power clashing with your power sparks fly we both get beat up. Every little motion is carefully mapped out and shown even with quick camera changes and rotations, this anime wants you to KNOW these characters are physically able and can fight. Not to mention the detailed facial scenes from non human characters that just creep you out because its supposed to. The art direction for this show belongs on every single anime movie in my opinion.
I don't think it's the perfect anime by any means, but with the way this first wave of episodes went, even though i wanted it to slow down and take its time, it has amazing potential as a shonen. It gets my recommendation for the season, and something to keep an eye on during the final have of the first season.",9,squabbel
40748,"
                Jujutsu Kaisen is the battle shonen every battle shonen should aspire to be. Jujutsu Kaisen doesn't reinvent the genre or isn't 100% original in any way, but it does everything right. One thing so many battle shonens do is have characters throw two punches at each other then they will start having a conversation about how cool their moves are or some garbage like that in their fight scenes. Jujustu Kaisen does have that, but the fight scenes are GOLD. This show will like have a full minute of characters fighting each other with no interruptions. The choreography in this show is absolutely insane, you
                  can tell the animators cared about making this project. I've seen lots of fighting anime and Jujutsu Kaisen has some of the best fight scenes of all time within its first season. Like I just want to watch a fight scene where the characters just fight for a minute rather than having two frames of punching then transitioning to talking. Yes, the story isn't anything too special, but who cares? The show is a joy to watch with amazing fights and great characters. I don't think there is a single character that is dislikeable. I see great potential in this show and can defiantly see it becoming one of the biggest anime of all time. I honestly think this is a good starter anime, so if you never have seen an anime, this is a good place to start.",9,Eonnnnn
40748,"
                I'll keep this short. So far (ep15) I love this anime. The story isn't a 10 out of 10 at the moment but it definitely has a lot of potential to become one even though it probably won't happen this season since the tournament arc is coming up now. What surprised me a lot were the characters. There really isn't a single character I don't like, I just hope they all get the screentime they deserve (especially Panda). I really like the fights and it's always fun to watch the fights (especially the one in ep 15 between Itadori and Todou where I really liked
                  the camera angles) The first class animations and sounds complete the fights perfectly. 
In addition, I find it very good how JJK not consistently fulfills clichés as I thought at first but also unexpected things like (SPOILER) Junpeis dead and so also first-class the character development of Itadori advances. 
But in addition to the dark elements, the comedy parts are also very appropriately integrated so that I was very surprised a few times what was happening but nevertheless had to laugh. 
All in all, I just have to say that I have enjoyed the previous episodes very much and look forward to another episode every week and I can recommend this series to anyone who likes action and wants to try something new.",10,BestoFriendo

                How many episodes to ""get"" this show/season: 2
Non-Spoiler Review:
This type of Shonen is one of those that does so much right while making it feel new and refreshing, that you respond with ""Why hasn't this been done before?"" To that question I say: ""Because it required a lot of inspiration to pull off""
In a simple sentence, what makes JJK as an action Shonen/Seinen stand out from the sea of others is its ability to pull inspiration from great works. Being able to see other stories and add your own twist to them is a skill that many claim to have but very few execute well.
                  This anime does it very well. If you are a fan of My Hero, Naruto, or other semi-long shonens, this show will scratch your itch.
Story: While it might throw you off at first, JJK's pacing is faster than most. You don't follow characters through their daily lives training and living, you get right into the meat of things. This is a trait Fire Force used well and while the first episode can feel rushed, once you get used to how the show presents things it becomes clear this is a positive. Instead of seeing the daily lives of characters, we get more moments of that payoff of practice and mastery and it doesn't feel like we missed anything. Situations really test their characters for the better and the show does a good job at making these moments stand out.
- Art -
Animation: Right from episode 1 you will notice that at least once in an episode, they go crazy on a cut and really surprise you with how well a sequence looks for it. They use rotoscoping or great tracking camera shots to achieve very immersive perspectives. 
Art-Style: In terms of art-style, does a good job at creating very fluid energy flow and very thick-bordered attacks. Hard to explain but it is very consistent. 
3D: JJK has I believe 1 scene where 3D is noticeable, but otherwise is very good at making 3D blend well into the scene seamlessly. They use rotoscoping more often to create that ""lifelike"" movement. 
- Sound -
Music: This aspect is one that carries JJK. The types of music you hear in this are so diverse and so unique that they end up making scenes feel so alive with the emotions of those involved. Scary music makes you feel creeped out, high bpm rock/rap makes you feel ""in the fray"". Scene in this show wouldn't feel nearly as iconic if they didn't have this amazing soundtrack.
Sound Effects: The sound effects for attacks and monsters is well done. Monsters sound very monster-y and attacks feel very vivid because of the sounds they sometimes make.
Character:
If you hadn't heard of some of the characters in this show already, you are in for a treat. Most every character in JJK has a really unique personality. Because of the interaction between emotions and some systems within the world, each character needs to have emotions like rage, anger, guilt, sorrow, pleasure. These things really help elevate many character past just being side characters and it helps make characters feel like they have presence. JJK does a great job at putting character into spots where these ideals can be tested and they, and the story, come out better because of it.
Enjoyment: This show makes me happy every time I watch it.
Overall: This show is in a league of its own personally when it comes to shonens. I have never been interested in longer running shonens past 70 episodes, but this show (and its source material) might help change my mind on that. My one negative I would attribute to this show would be on rare occasions, they will go so hard on the animation that it looks a little over-done/too complex, but these shots aren't super long so it end up not hurting much.
This is one of those shows I would recommend to anyone.",10,Ritinal

And I’m so happy I gave into the pressure from everyone!! It’s such a great anime. The characters are amazing. The battles are awesome. Villains are awesome.

                Jujutsu Kaisen represents a modern shounen anime the way it should be, action-packed beautifully animated and somewhat interesting story. Characters are special and easy to fall in love with. The plot itself is a bit complicated from time to time. Whenever a new technique, creature, or character background is introduced it gets really puzzled, and a bit though to understand. The main protagonist is nothing new and special compared to other protagonists from different shounen series, although he does have a nice sarcastic side, and funny interactions with rest of the side characters. As for the villains of the series, their character hasn't been explored
                  that much, so hopefully they get more interesting in the future. Music is fantastic when it comes to action scenes, as are openings and endings. In the end, Jujutsu Kaisen is a perfect anime for those who seek a action filled fighting scenes with great animation.",8,Okamichannn

                Honestly this is a great shonen, so long as you keep your expectations in check. Definitely not the best ever (saw someone call it god tier, heh, no), though it's in the same realm as Boku no hero S1/2 or early Naruto/Bleach. However I have to say, it has been a long while (maybe since HxH?) since I have been EXCITED for an episode every week. Not a lot of anime can do that to me anymore, and for that alone I think it deserves an 8. Overall for me the strengths are the art and music, the characters and story are relatively cookie cutter,
                  nothing special when it comes to shonen. However when paired with good art and good music it turns it into a soul food shonen, enjoyable to watch and listen, nothing crazy to sit and scratch your head over wondering if it's a red herring or an actual plot point for the future, just good quality comforting supernatural action shonen. Scratches that itch really good. I will say though, do NOT approach this anime like it's HxH or FMA or [insert any other classic/masterpiece here]. This is comfort food anime, not a 16 course michelin 3 star meal.
Hopefully they don't cut corners to save on budget and start cheapening the cgi/art (cough BHNA /cry). Also hopefully it doesn't go down a bad story rabbit hole (cough Bleach /cry). Or wade into crappy anime only filler story (cough Naruto /cry).
Depending on the continued quality and the story not turning to garbage, I could even see myself coming back and giving this series a 9 some day because it's that enjoyable (to me! Your mileage may vary), that's a long way off though and time will tell.",8,gakinotsukai

                Jujitsu Kaisen is a typical anime of action super yadda yadda cliché of an anime, this anime however it got my stomach feeling numb (eating something weird in the anime LOL) the main character reminds me a little of 
NATU Dragneel personality and it's hilarious to watch this character. So anyways, of course people won't watch this anime but if you are looking for something to watch there is no harm, sitting down with popcorn
and watching it as it is good. I don't think I spoiled much at all and here is my rating. (BTW I don't like rating it like this but will try)
                  (Disclaimer) This is a review as far as episodes 8 obviously the anime will progressively change and get good or bad, or not haha)
Character 6/10 
There is not much character involvement or development throughout the anime because we are still trying to understand what the purpose of some of the characters are and their backstory which we have not been introduced yet
the main character has almost no background story shown yet either, but we are slowly getting introduced new characters which can be a little overbearing as you have learned almost nothing of the main character and been piled on
with more characters. I do like the one character, and he is awesome!!
Story 6/10 
The story is very clever but at the same time weird. The story basically has A to B and that's it, nothing else going on, there has not been much back story other than you are thrown in the deep end of the anime which is fine still.
You can still use your imagination or put yourself as the main character rather then depending on a backstory. There seems to be more happening each episode so eventually will be fed some back story here and there hopefully.
Art 7/10 
Art is wonderful, fun to watch, because of the enjoyment of the art style and appreciating the minor details that are put here and there.  It sometimes feels relaxing to watch, because of the intro. Good clean animation.
Music 6/10
OPENING SONG IS GOOD! Cough... um the anime has good themed sound tracks of suspense and feeling sad and sorrowful.

                This is one of the very few animes that I've forced myself into completing, hoping for it's story to improve at some point or to find any unique unforgettable character, with no success.
Story
Other than acting as an introduction to the characters and settings, the whole season does not contribute anything relevant. This is worsened by an excessive usage of flashbacks that prevent the story from having an appropriate pacing. 
Art
Without doubt, the animation is the best aspect of the series. The textures, shading and smoothness of the movements are top level and leave evidence of what anime is Mappa's current favourite.
Sound
The soundtrack is a masterpiece
                  on its own, however it is unfitting for certain scenes, hence distracting.
Characters
No worth-remembering characters are included in the series. All of them have flat, completely forgettable personalities that oscillate drastically between the seriousness of many seinen characters and the dumbness and recklessness of a stereotypical shounen character. The dynamics between them are odd and only forced by circumstances. The protagonist's personality, which constantly feels like a direct Kurosaki Ichigo rip-off, makes any gore scene feel utterly disgusting, even to fans of such genre.
The only remarkable character is Satoru Gojo, not because of his personality, which feels like Kakashi's rip-off, but because of how beautifully he was animated.",4,BLU3B1RD

                Just like Kimestu no Yaiba(Demon Slayer) this show is just great and worth your time.
I think JJK, Demon Slayer and Aot(not watched ) are the show of the new generation.
It is a show that can be enjoyed regardless of age. Most importantly the Excitement you get while watching it is same as that playing your favourite show. It is an adrenaline rush.
I will give it a score of 9 because it is unlike any other shonen mentioned above and was not able to make a special place in my heart. It shows you know is gone be great and is great. 
Jujutsu Kaisen is a
                  great anime for new anime watchers to start from because it is the perfect show to get hooked on. It is shown which you can wait for a week and the excitement of the show wouldn't die while binging it would have the same feeling.
To talk about the story it has the story of a modern type of Shonen show. The show revolves around Itadori Yuji been possessed by a strong cursed spirit. It is how he adjusted to the new surrounding where there are spirits and people who exorcism them. Along making friends.
But, most important Gojo Sataro is one of the best character I have seen in anime. He is frecking awesome.
The art is heavenly in its own style yet it stands out for it like the other Shonen jump. The animation is a piece of art and is frecking awesome anyone can tell. The Sound is an important part of a show and the JJK has done that greatly. While character is new but they are great each of them has their own aspects to them and you can enjoy anyone of them.

                This is my first review, maybe because this anime looks like a ghost hunter.
typical of most shounen anime, the main character is weak then becomes strong. but, what I like about Jujutsu Kaisene is the supernatural and the horror, the story is like a ghost hunter not many horror anime like this, most horror anime only shows gore and jumpscare. that's sucks i don't like it. 
talking about the characters, I hate weak characters, Yuuji is one of them. 
at the beginning of the episode Yuuji is very strong even to beat the world record but after a few episodes he only relied on Sukuna
                  power it make me disappointed, what I liked is the Sukuna instead Yujii but, I hope the main character becomes strong and feared. 
the art and animation are good, the art is similar to Madhouse studio, then the fighting scene is smooth, brutal, and not long-winded (to the point), if you want to beat someone, you don't need talk too much. 
The music and sound is not bad, the opening and ending, both I like it, especially the opening by eve, the opening animation matches the song and I like the vocalist's voice. 
the voice actor is also very suitable especially sukuna voice and the sound effect is not bad either. 
overall Jujutsu Kaisen is one of the best this season can't say much and don't judge too fast because this is only 6 episodes and Jujutsu Kaisen has 24 episodes, mappa execution is pretty good, I expected more from Mappa.

story: 10/10
the story isn't something mind blowing or too crazy, but it was the execution that was done to perfection. there are a lot of anime out there with the most interesting summary, but when you actually watch it, the execution just isn't there. absolutely not for jjk. the pacing, development, and emotional connection with characters were all there and there's really nothing more i can critisize about. a good plot doesn't need to be groundbreaking and unique, all it needs is good execution and pacing.

sound: 10/10
i'm usually kind of picky about the sound, but i swear, every single soundtrack in jjk i loved. i never skipped a single opening song and i always found myself playing the ending song all the way through as well. soundtracks were used in the perfect moments to make sure the scene was impactful, and i nearly cried in the end. the music with it just got me emotional.
character: 1000/10
i don't even need to explain, but i'll still talk about it. every single character was done to perfection. i fell in every single one of the, and i love how op the villains were. the mcs didn't win easily every time, and it always kept me at the edge of my seat. itadori yuuji is probably the first protagonist under the ""heroic mc"" trope that i absolutely loved. he's so pure and just a ball of sunshine. i also love how female characters aren't portrayed as the ""useless characters that always need protection."" nobara was so badass i love her to death. megumi is also badass and fine. last but not least, gojo satoru. do i even need to explain? i'm sure you've heard about him one way or another even if you haven't watched jjk. he's got the largest fanbase i have ever seen, and that's understandable.

                This is hecking good. That's all, that's it. It is so worth your time, I personally enjoyed it a lot and I cannot wait for a season 2. Please check this out, it won't disappoint you. I loved every single character and their individual personalities as well as the story. I can't take the suspense of waiting for the revelation of many secrets, but I must wait. The ops and eds were also very good and I couldn't help but memorize the songs. I like that every character has a story and can't wait to see everyone's. Leaving me just like this at season 1

Was told to watch it by many of my friends and im glad i did.
Im a really big fan of how the curse power works and how it can easily be used for both good and bad. The character development is really good although it is only 24 episodes.
The only problem i have is that they introduced characters and then don't really do much with them. I am yet to read the manga so i may be wrong but i feel as if they are focusing on the main characters a bit too much and they could start doing more eith side charcaters.
I hope they

                I love this anime a lot because it has some of the best animation I’ve seen recently. The plot isn’t anything superb but it’s definitely a solid plot, not too complex but not really basic either. For the characters I wouldn’t say this show has insane characters, however some are quite well written, the protagonist is quite generic, but he is still fun to watch. Many of the side characters such as Toudou, Gojo and Megumi are very fun to watch and have interesting personalities. As for the sound the music in fight scenes is great and very fitting and the openings and endings are
                  bangers. I enjoyed this anime a ton and if you like shonen anime, and are a fan of demon slayer, My hero academia and such, you will love this anime!",9,Sadreamo

                I'm torn between a 7 and an 8. I eventually decided with a 7. This review is written at episode 13.
Pay no mind to the extremely negative reviews that are written before episode 10-13. I think it's quite unfair to write a review when you have not finished even half of the show. To be fair, writing a review before the season is over is not ideal either, but I feel like I have a better grasp of the show's writing, set-up and character building by now. The scores are subject to changes once this season is over. 
Story: 6/10. Pretty typical shonen. I don't
                  think there's anything unique about the story, but the plot is intriguing enough for you to keep watching. It's not anything to keep you on edge and ponder over, though. However, the comedy is great, and episode 12 is when the show becomes much more mature with its take on good and evil as well as moral relativity. 
Art: 10/10. I thought Mappa did really well with the art, esp the background.
Sound: 6/10. The soundtracks are catchy, but not that memorable, except for the OP and the ED, which earn a solid 10/10. 
Character: 7/10. There are some fillers characters that I have no idea what their purposes in the story are besides annoying the heck out of the audience. If this review had been written a few weeks prior, characters would receive a 3 out of 10 because even though some characters are pretty interesting, they are as flat as a number line. However, the turmoil in episode 12 introduced some growth to the main character, who has now realized how difficult it can be to stay truthful to his principles, and whether his principles are even valid in this messed-up world. Supporting characters' backstory and motivation are also displayed, so the audience feels attached to them and can easily empathize with them. Sadly, however, the characters are still very much in the mould of shonen, and the villains are not very exciting, so I cannot give them 10/10. Look forward to what the future brings.
Enjoyment: 9/10. The fights are great, and the writing is good enough to keep me going, although I would have probably dropped it if the story had kept on being superficial like episodes prior to ep 10. It's pretty funny, too.",7,paranoid_soul

                Jujutsu Kaisen started off with flying colors and MAPPA has done a fantastic job, especially the animation and the action sequences, which were a top notch.
Gojou Satoru became an instant favourite (although it heavily reminds us of Kakashi Sensei), with it's innate capability and strength bundled with charmness and humour. Even though it has the plot similar to other Shounens, the concept here has a unique approach and delivers with a substantial quality.
Jujutsu Kaisen is easily among the Top 5 best animes of 2020 and there's no denying that it has a long way to go ahead and is already crazily popular among the anime
                  viewers. Hope it stays the same like the manga and it might become a classic in years to come.
I am eagerly waiting for the 2nd season announcement and hope MAPPA sticks to the second season as well.",9,Hail_Lelouch

                Jujutsu Kaisen [QUICK REVIEW]
Jujutsu Kaisen one of the best animes I've ever seen, interesting theme and story, accompanied with an incredible art, btw MAPPA studios what should I expect right? the OP Kaikai Kitan by Eve, omg dude how this could be so amazing, every time I start the episode it gives so much hype bro it's just amazing, following to characters none other than Gojo Satoru, if you like a little of comedy in animes I think you'll like this character, all the funny moments that have in the serie he's there, he's one of the most charismatic and important characters in the anime,
                  for the last but not less important Yuuji, Megumi and Nobara these three dude they're amazing just for being them and they have a little comedy moments between them. Concluding I give a overall rating 10/10, all points are good I don't have anything to disgust so, pretty good job MAPPA!

                I will say it right now, JJK is not a 10. Could it be? Maybe but I don't think so. That being said as someone who doesn't watch much shounen, JJK is very enjoyable once you give it a chance.
Story 5/10
Until episode 18, it was very hard for me to get into the plot and actually enjoy it. It didn't start off bad, but it was just never enough to keep me excited throughout the episode or make me want to watch the next one. The beginning starts very abrupt, which can be a good thing, but in this case didn't really work out. I
                  would explain more, but I want to give as little spoilers as possible. Personally I think it would have been better to at least ease into the Jujutsu sorcerers world a little better.
Art 9/10
The animation, as a big demon slayer fan, is on par with demon slayer. The fight scenes are smooth and exciting and really pulls you in. I love darker animation style and gore which I haven't really seen much in other shounen.
Sound 9/10
Both the endings and openings are very good. The music fits in so well with the animations and are very entertaining to watch no matter how many times you've seen them. Easily my top favourite OP's and ED's.
Characters 6/10
This is the one area I am a little unsure about. While the characters can seem deep or complex, I'm unsure how deep it can really go. I like most of the side characters. I think they are nicely thought out, but don't take too much away from the main 3. But I do have some issues with the 3 main characters.
Yuuji: 
The only real motivation/backstory we see from Yuuji, is his grandfather (which had very little screen time or significance besides starting off the story) and his two friends that we see in episode one and are never mentioned again. Yuuji does have the contrast of his heroic joyful personality with Sukuna, but that can only take his character so far. He is lucky enough that he was born with super human strength, and with little training can battle tough enemies with out (technically) dying. He is overpowered in my opinion but at least he differs in the sense that he knows when he is weak and isn't naive enough to think that he can beat anyone just off of will power. 
Megumi and Nobara:
I actually really like Megumi as a character. Even though, like Yuuji, we don't see or know much about his backstory or motivations. That being said, since we know so little there is much potential for his character. He is not overly powerful and knows his weak points and that he has much room to grow. Now Nobara is 50/50 for me as a character. I do like that she is not overly powerful but she also isn't just a side girl character that can't pull her weight. But, I think her character can be over the top. She easily gets mad at any of the characters for weird reasons and seems very harsh which makes her an unlikable character to watch. That being said, I can't wait to see her grow and develop as a character. 
Enjoyment 8/10
Even though it took a while for me to actually be enjoying the show, I'm rating it a 8/10 because once I did, I was hooked. Even with its flaws I still think it's a good anime and I can't wait to see more.
Overall 8/10
My ratings might change, but overall JJK is a great anime that slightly differs from other shounen. Is it a 10/10? No. But I am enjoying it so far and would definitely recommend it!

                I have given it a rate of 7 for now waiting for the story to be more interesting, I like to say this anime has somethings that remind me of my favorite manga ""Chainsaw man"" like how the curses ""devils"" exist, how promises are very strict and can't be broken and if so there will be a frightening punishment. The art ,animation and fights are all great! The characters are very interesting, funny and teenlike, but understanding the superpowers they have is a little bit complicated . Soundtracks are not impressive but they are good, Op and ED are very delightful! And at the end

Jujutsu Kaisen is still even good, despite being released two years ago. Watching this makes me bite my nails off, fingers too!

                This show is a masterpiece in the making quite frankly, and anybody who has finished the first season should know that by now. I would describe this show as Hero Academia except better in every single way possible. It starts off interesting and engaging enough but it most certainly grows on you every episode, because it gets better every episode. It's seamless in its' story and character-building and only leaves you craving more, and I'm hoping I can hold out on reading the manga until the next instalment is released.
STORY: 9
Jujustu Kaisen is a classic shounen with a few amazing twists that keeps the audience
                  on the edge of their seat, but it is still a shounen, so it goes in arcs but with an overarching villain and looming climax from the beginning. For the start of a new series that will likely take a long time to finish, this setting up of the story was phenomenal. There was an introduction to our main cast, an unexpected and tragic death to introduce the... pseudo-villain of the series?? (I honestly can't tell which of the two main villains will be more villainous by the climax of the story) And then a classic tournament arc that set up the rest of the cast and begin characterisation. To put it simply, it was just a job well-done. The world-building could be difficult to understand since they explain it so fast but it's still extremely intriguing regardless. 
ART: 10
This is probably the most beautiful anime I have ever seen. It's gorgeous and glossy in most scenes then comical and simple during funny parts and so damn stylised and cool during fights with powers that are not within the human sphere, and therefore neither is their art-style. The character design is also one of my favourites, since every character feels like an individual person rather than the archetype they're supposed to fit. If not anything else, this show is absolutely stunning.
SOUND: 10
The music from the op and ed were two of my favourite 2020 theme songs, especially ALI's ending 'Lost in Paradise' which is legendary honestly. The second half of the season wasn't as good, theme-song wise but remained fantastic; it just wanted to achieve a more emotional performance than the first part. Throughout the show the soundtrack is perfect. You genuinely notice the bangers that play in the fight scenes that just make you so much more engaged. Overall, an outstanding addition to the show.
CHARACTER: 9
Characters are always so difficult to analyse, especially when there is this much depth to explore within the main three lol. I guess I'll oddly begin with the antagonist (my personal favourite) Sukuna. It's so interesting to have the antagonist by the protagonists' side from the very beginning with the irony of his ability to assist and save our main character, Itadori Yuji, at any time as well as take hold of the situation entirely and destroy all sides of the conflict. Sukuna is simultaneously someone who the audience relies on to save Yuji in a pinchm, but also the person that scares everyone the most. Off the top of my head, he's the most entertaining antagonist I've seen so far. Now on to our main gang. Yuji, Megumi and Nobara don't spend all that much time together until towards the end of the season, but honestly, that's all it takes to know that they have amazing chemistry as a team and as friends. Yuji and Nobara bicker endlessly and antagonize anyone they can and Megumi is the chill guy who sits behind them all chill. We see them all connect and bond with each other and it really hits. Like I really really care about these characters and their relationship. Yuji is a simple guy who doesn't want to be alone. When someone gets hurt because of him, it seriously affects him and we see that. He takes on responsibility for what Sukuna does, or what others do when he has to deal with the consequences. Seeing a usually comical and hilarious character take such a hard hit never fails to get me emotional. Along with that, the generally stone-faced Megumi losing his cool is just as good. Megumi is a very interesting character, and I find it difficult to put the development he goes through in writing since we haven't seen anywhere near his full arc. But all I can say right now is that every one of his fight scenes is better than the last and I can't wait to see more of him. Now Nobara, who is definitely the most interesting of the three. She's a pretty vain girl who's a bit of a delinquent when it comes to, well, literally anything. But not only is she hilarious in her antics, I also very much so enjoy her as a contrast to the usual feminine role of the woman in the main cast of a shounen. She's masculine despite caring about her appearance, and she embraces that. She appreciates who she is regardless of what expectations are put on her as a woman. And hot-take: feminism rarely works well in anime; they're kind shit at it. But Nobara is an awesome female character that embodies that none of the female cast give a damn about the fact that they're women and its cool. She's also just a super likeable character, very badass. The rest of the cast is also generally likeable. Gojo is hilarious, a good mentor, overly-badass and way too attractive for anime (wtf?). The rest of the school all have their own stories, some more interesting than other, but all very valid and do well for characterisation. ultimately, I need to see more of this to give characters a 10 but it is certainly looking to go that way.
ENJOYMENT: 10
I mean, what can I say? It was a hell of a ride. I loved every second of it and I can't wait for more. Every single aspect of this show was awesome and emotive and made me scream and laugh and cry more times than I can count. I even cried at the voice acting of a dying villain at one point, like damn did you have to sound that heartbroken? Basically, it's amazing.
OVERALL: 10
Genuinely one of my favourite anime thus far. I'm really excited for the continuation and I'll try my best not to read ahead in the meantime (gotta hold out for the god-tier animation - thank you MAPPA). If you're on the fence: please watch this show. It's worth every second. Just do it.",10,Rebeccee
40748,"
                Series like this one that belongs to the Shonen demography will always have a lot of prejudices, and believe me, I had a lot of doubts too while starting this anime/manga, which starts simple both in premise and plot, but as a manga reader, I can safely say that a lot of things that could seem as flaws or lazily touched plot points here on its first season, are all actually little details, characterizations, flashbacks, etc, that serve the purpose of being the bases of the overall storyline structure, so in a nutshell, a well done build up.
But don't get me wrong, I'm not saying
                  JJK is flawless or anything, as I'll be explaining its pros and cons, is just that this season specifically starts simple, and there are not a alot of things to complain about, and also that you can't criticize and portray as flaws aspects and details of a show that is still ongoing, since a lot will be explained and used later, specially considering that is just the first season of a longrunner.
STORY: 6/10  
So let's start with the premise, which I can get why it pushes some people off the series, it has its fair amount of typical Shonen traits, and oh Lord are they typical. 
The initial setup being in a Supernatural Highschool, dividing the students into teams, each one being composed of 4 members, and the main team having similarities with a certain blond Ninja team (I will talk more about this last point in the character section), but all of these are just that, traits, and in every story is not about ""WHAT"", but ""HOW"" (execution), which I gotta say, it starts simple but solid.
Its story starts with our main character Yuji Itadori, a physiscally strong teen that has been sentenced to death after trying to save his friends and eating one of the twenty cursed fingers belonging to Ryomen Sukuna, the king of curses, causing Itadori to be possessed by Sukuna.
The premise follows the classic hero in search of something, these being Sukuna's fingers, so Itadori can consume him all and be killed once and for all, since Sukuna is a huge treat for their world and every attempt to get rid of the last possessed remains of Sukuna (his fingers) have been impossible even to the strongest sorcerers.
The storyline then follows some typical character introductions, training arcs, competitions, and side missions to set the cast and worldbuilding, most of these arcs while not being bad by any means, can feel a little slow and bland at times, not being thematically complex most of the time, I have to say this is the biggest negative point from this first season, it can get really simplistic at times, but what really make these possible dull moments to be more enjoyable are its characters and their interactions. 
The only arc which is an exception and is overall excellent on this first season is the Junpei one, which is thematically heavy and has tons of good drama and character development.
Series gets a lot better later on but the focus here is its first season.
A great thing I have to say about the series and as a manga reader, is how the plot is full of very impressive moments of foreshadowing since the first episode, which shows how well Akutami planned his work. 
I won't talk a lot about the comedy since it's kind of very subjective, but overall it's really not bad, has its fair amount of weird moments but nothing that is directly shoved right after or in the middle of a dramatic moment, which is the worse way to use comedy (right, MCU?).
I'd also like to point out how good the horror aspect is used in some of the moments of tension, mostly on the Junpei arc fot the first season.
So, overall while not being very good, its first season has a really fair and enjoyable story, setting up the bases of the rest of the narrative.
Art: 10/10
Nothing to say here that has not been pointed out already by many people, the adaptation is excellent, the character designs while using the same variety of clothes (undestarndable since is an uniform), they all have really distinguishable face features, all with their different and unique body and cranial structure.
The animation is just flawless, all of Mappa's animators exceeded themselves adapting this, the sakuga animation is some of the best I've seen in the whole medium, the high frames, choreography, everything is excellent, all of these aspects being some of the main reasons this series got a lot of attention and is generally loved, but it's ironic how at the same time this can be some kind of curse (srsly no pun intended), since it can get a lot of unjustified claims of how it's the only impressive aspect of the series, when in this case is simply not true, and I'll get more into explaining why.
Sound: 10/10
Another excellent aspect, Openings and Endings are excellent (dear Lord those first ones are straight Fire), the ost overall focuses a lot on a type of postmodern Japanese hiphop with some rock moments, with its fair amount of variety, and it always knows how and when to use its great soundtracks, that Itadori and Nobara moment in episode 24... my God!
The voice acting is excellent too, shout out for Junya Enoki for those excellent screams in both funny and dramatic scenes.
Characters: 8/10
And here we are in what is probably one of the best aspects this series has.
So I'd like to bring up one thing I said on the story aspect, this being about how JJK grabs a lot of traits from different other Shonens, specially a very specific one, which I have to say, yes, it is clearly very inspired from several other works, but like I said, it's always about the execution.
And even without considering this there's some unjustified claims about how they are badly written, how the main cast is bland, poorly written, and Itadori's just your typical dense Shonen main character.... I'm sorry but, what show did you watch?
If you just watch the series and analyze it on a surface level, yeah, it would seem like that, but there are so much traits to analyze about these characters specially Itadori, that it's weird how anyone would get only that from the main cast. And no this won't be me overanalyzing stuff.
So first of all, JJK characters and specially Itadori, are builded in a way that stays away from one of the worst power fantasy/Shonen tropes, which is the narrative revolving around the protagonist way too much, to the point of following only his/her centered ideology as if it's the ONE and ONLY right one, leaving not too much space for development, the main characters get better on the thing they propose themselves accomplishing (getting stronger, saving someone, founding something, etc,) but their overall ideologies never get atleast questioned nor do they struggle a lot with those, everything is served to them, as if they are the chosen ones, the only stakes are some characters dying here and there but just for the sake of stakes and not for development nor a big inner conflict, and what is worse is that the protagonists just get sad for a moment but never actually change perspectives nor develop, they just ""become stronger"", basically they are characters that are written as if the world owes them everything.
Jujutsu Kaisen is one of the exceptions, Itadori's a character that feels organically good as a person, instead of the forced, stereotypical, and archetypical goody two shoes that never changes throughout the whole story, his ideologies have been tested several times and he has seen the living hell of actually dealing with a ""power fantasy"" where there will be times where you can't always save everyone, but executing this not only with random civilians but with actual developed and important characters.
Also it is a pro how the ""living demon"" inside of him is probably not gonna end becoming his ally, on the contrary, Sukuna harm him a lot specially in a psychological level, adding more conflict within our main character Itadori.
So, saying all of these characters are only your generic shonen archetypes like I've seen some people say is ridiculous...
Fushiguro Megumi and Kugisaki Nobara: They are both very interesting characters, but Fushiguro ends up being the better one so far between these two, he at first glance is your quiet ""emo"" character, but he is actually very compassionate with others while also being very strict about his morality, ""not forgiving anyone that has done serious harm to other ones"",making him an extremist for this ideology to the point of considering himself a martyr to save others, paying up attention you can see several times how he shows these traits and tried to sacrifice himself for others, making him the only loss, this last aspect will be explained later, since is something that he has not shown yet so far as on the first season, but the point is that he has really solid and notable character traits, that will develop and have his character arcs centered on those aspects.
Nobara while annoying sometimes, is a really strong, self confident woman, a little superficial but also friendly, she is the weaker of the main cast but far from a bad character, her very special trait is how despite being superficial, she starts to open with others and can show her sweet and caring side too, but just like Fushiguro, has no mercy for the beings considered as curses and shows almost no empathy for them.
They both have shown a lot of affection for the MC and others, like when they were mourning Itadori after his ""death"", with Nobara clearly crying while Fushiguro was not affected that much due to him getting used to that, still showed clear guiltyness. So acting like that when they met him again is not a character ""inconsistency"" or anything, they already moved on from mourning a dude they got to meet for just like 2 weeks and after a couple of months they just see him alive again making a cheap joke... yeah, no melodramatic moment was necessary there, their shocked faces were enough.
The admiration Nobara has for Maki also shows a lot of that empathy and Fushiguro caring for his sister and some exposition hints about his relationship with the rest of his family, which are gonna be huge part of his character later.
Gojo Satoru: The series main mentor, this guy is one of those embodiments of the ""rule of cool"" aspect, he is extremely charismatic, extremely op but with a a really fun and unique personality, while not a bad character nor a really good one (atleast for this first season), his charisma is what make us people like him a lot, he is overall one of those characters that always get a smile from you, his techniques are also really interesting, unique, and really well thought.
I have to say that so far, the downside of this is that when he is present there is almost no tension, or any at all, we just know he is the one that will save the day, the good thing is that this only happens in one arc.
Kento Nanami: This guy is probably the best character in all of the first season, being one of those that actually reach a tridimensional level. 
Serving as one of the series mentors, he is a very realistic and down to earth person, introvert but smart and calculating that forms strategies that actually feel credible by using extremely well his cursed energy, also one of the other things that make him a really good character is his cold attitude towards his every day life and morality, like I said, he is realistic, and he knows when to separate sentimentalism from what it needs to be done, both on his work as a salaryman and sorcerer one, this leads him to act stoic and cold to the point of killing anyone dangerous, no matter if they're full curses or where at some point... human, this makes a lot of good and interesting interactions between him and the main character Itadori, because of how different they are about their ideologies.
Despite all of these, Nanami can find a special kind of empathy with his closest ones and even the daily life people he comes across with, for him, the little things in life are some of the most precious ones, and he acknowledges this.
Yoshino Junpei: Oh man if there's a tragic character on this sewries so far, this is the one.
Junpei is also one of the best characters from this first season, he starts as your outcast bullied character who wants that feeling of empathy, acceptance and... empowerment, the one to punish all the ones that mistreated him, Junpei goes through a good and tragic character arc, finds someone that gives him false hopes, crossed paths with our main character Itadori and became his friend, finding that acceptance and empathy he desperately was looking for; only for then being betrayed by the one that firstly showed him some moments of hope, became desperated and attacked his school, Itadori on a desperate attempt to stop him and finally convincing him, Junpei just got killed in the most tragic way by his traitor, Mahito, punished for the consequences of his own actions and curiosity.
He is an overall good commentary on bullying consequences and how far desperate people can get to just stop it when there's never some mutual help in time.
Mahito: Getting really tired about how lately a lot of scripts want to turn their villains into anti-heros and even romanticize them, giving them a cliché tragic past to justify their actions, and don't get me wrong, if executed well those ideas can create excellent villains/antagonists, but it's so overused nowadays that we don't see other different type of villains.
That's why Mahito feels fresh, he is the type of villain that is just pure evil, a natural abomination being born from human hatred between each other, but that's what makes him so interesting and not unidimensional, he is perceptive and bold, curious about everything that surrounds him and naturally cruel because of the way he was born, he also shows a lot of other traits like being playful and reasonable with his curse companions, and the most important thing, he is the antithesis of our protagonist Yuji Itadori, their ideologies are the literal polar opposite, villains like that are some of the most interesting ones.
Ryomen Sukuna: The main antagonist of the series and the King of curses, some kind of natural abomination villain too, but one that has a more personal relationship with our protagonist... but not in a good way.
So far Sukuna is still a big mystery, atleast here on the first season, his narcissistic and god complex attitude are his main traits, also his presence is always very intimidating and overall outstanding.
Jujutsu Highschool students: Have already made this section too long so I'll describe the rest of the characters briefly here cause they're mostly secondaries, doesn't mean some of them are not good or won't have big relevance later.
Inumaki is a fun, curious character but still has not shown a lot of qualities so far for obvious reasons, Maki's one of the coolest girls and characters of the series, determined despite having a big disadvantage since she was born, a really interesting character, Panda is also interesting, his origin explains more about how cursed energy works and gives more details about the worlbuilding, Miwa is the biggest sweetheart of the whole series, the kindest purest soul of them all, she's a fine character, Todo is one of the most charismatic dudes out there, has a solid characterization and traits, Mai is the other side of her sister Maki, has justified motives and a strong attitude, Mechamaru is one tragic soul, born with a similar kind of curse that Maki has, his interactions with Panda were good, Kamo has potential, his flashback is setting some big events for later, Shinomiya is the only one that hasn't got a lot of screen time aside form some fights and her thoughts about Mai.
Enjoyment: 10/10
This part is very subjective, but from an objective standpoint, the series is extremely well adapted and paced, making it satisfying, consistent, and fun to watch, without any kind of filler, unimportant scenes, nor huge info dumps.
Overall: 9/10
It's so far, an excellent adaptation of a manga that has the potential to be really good, with its good amount of great characters, coherent storyline, creative techniques/power system, and a plot that keeps getting bigger and more complex.",9,Revan203

                I watched a lot of anime about 5 years ago but lost my love for it along the way. This show is not perfect by any means but I'm rating it a 10 just based on how much I'm enjoying it. Yes, it's fast-paced and characters are introduced to us with little introduction/depth but I genuinely really like the characters, especially our main lead Yuji. The voice acting (especially Gojo, Sukuna, and Nanami's VAs), action direction, and the art is really well-done. The fighting scenes are so fluid. 
You might not enjoy this show as much as I do and of course, there's better anime
                  out there in terms of writing and plot but I really like this one. The plot so far isn't something too special but there are some interesting themes about death and morality. It's entertaining and I'm having fun! I hope you give it a chance and maybe you'll love it too.",10,Exollent

                A masterpiece. This season is just the beginning and probably the worst out of all of the upcoming ones. Definitely recommend it. An easy 10/10. If you haven't seen it yet I recommend you try it out and see how you like it. If you enjoyed watching anime like Kimetsu no Yaiba, Naruto, and Noragami, this one is like the cherry on top. 
Things I enjoyed:
•The art is on par with the manga. Some frames look like they have been MS Painted over and slapped into the anime. That's how accurate the art of the anime is in comparison to the manga.
•The OSTs are amazing
                  and very well produced. They capture the vibe of the scene very well. 
•The range of characters is well-portrayed. Each is given a background story and the supporting characters fall into place compared to the main ones. They help the plot progress at a steady rate.
•The pacing of the anime is great too. Approximately 3 manga chapters per anime episode. (Except the first chapter. The first episode is solely dedicated to the first chapter of the series.)
Things I didn't enjoy:
•The story picks up exponentially from where S1 ended. So having to wait potentially more than a year is quite heartbreaking.
Overall, I find Jujutsu Kaisen to be one of the greatest modern shounen anime. Great job to both Gege Akutami and MAPPA for creating an amazing series and adaptation. Excited for what's to come in the prequel movie and future seasons!",10,suneater11

                So I decided to watch this anime, based on me trying to read the manga and it just got too complicated. So I gave the anime a shot to see if it could clear things up. It did. Thankfully lol. Anyways, here's the review.
Story: Good story, but overly complicated. I get why they explained how cursed energy and techniques work so often, but it was kind of just over-complex. Though there's a lot of potential in the future for it. It really sets up for good growth and future storylines that make the complexity necessary... They didn't really dive too deep into the story's MAIN
                  characters for all of the character development they did. But it's good nonetheless. Towards the end, I was sort of like ""okay, get on with it man"". I'll be interested to see what they do with season 2 though (if there is).
Art: The art was great, it stuck with the manga and I like that. It's silly, and yet good during fight scenes. 
Sound: A couple of times, the music (with lyrics) was rivaling the characters speaking. That totally could have been avoided... But everything else is good.
Character: I get that most anime characters have tragic backstories, but the fact that every single character is written to have a ""tragic"" backstory is redundant. I disliked how during multiple points in THE SAME FIGHT, BACKSTORIES (some of which never actually finished) ARE GIVEN. it messes with the flow, and I forget that the character was even fighting when they go back to the main scene lol. Also, some of the backstories that are supposed to be sad or tragic are just not. Really, like, they are really reaching for a sad story or an excuse of the characters' behavior of their story (IE one of the side character's sisters... won't spoil it). There's just a lot that was over explained that was not needed, while some of the characters (like the MAIN ONES), needed to be delved into a bit more). 
Enjoyment & Overall: To be honest, it's a cliche anime. It's dragged out, there's A LOT OF INNER MONOLOGUE, long long long fight scenes, the tragic backstories feel a bit forced and unoriginal, but at the same time it's got some cool art, the fight scenes are fun to watch (even though they are a bit too long), and it's not completely predictable. It's a cool concept, and I'm looking forward to Season 2.",7,nic016

                In the actuality of Shounen, Jujutsu Kaisen stands at the frontlines, alongside series like Black Clover and Chainsaw Man. It has been one of the most hyped anime of its generation, and like any hyped anime the fandom is always divided between those who say its Hunter x Hunter 2.0 and its God incarnate in Shounen anime, and those who say its overhyped bland trash. So my goal is to write a balanced, slightly biased, review, because I honestly love Jujutsu Kaisen. Also, bear in mind that many of my ratings will be relative because this is Shounen we're talking about; and I shall rate
                  it accordingly. I'll divide the review in a few categories, and end with my general thoughts about it: Story (the structure of it, the pacing, etc), plot (the actual driving devices in the narrative), power system, world building and lore, fight scenes, characters(both the character design and development), comedy,  and finally basicly everything that pertains solely to the anime adaptation. If you haven't seen it integraly, beware of spoilers ahead. So, let's begin. 
Story:
The story structure is good. Nothing too flashy, and the pacing can be a little awkward at times, but it never gets in the way of the show's enjoyability. I commend Akutami for making it seem like this would be another ""monster of the day"" type of thing, with Yuuji gradually consuming all of Sukuna's fingers, but quickly mixes it up. The author understands that that kind of story structure adds very little to the story and is too ""squared"". It doesn't flow easily. So, after the trio faces the special grade curse, the pacing changes. It was here however that I found it awkward. I mean, the main character ""dies"" and people are like "" oh well, time to some good ol' tournment arc"". In general, I can excuse this because it serves a lot of purposes. Itadori playing dead allows him to fill the gap in his abilities, and through his learning we, the audience, learn more about the JJK world and power system. It also gives Megumi and Nobara opportunity to shine without Itadori, although it isn't as well done as it could be. Then, the story flows fine until we reach the final of the Kyoto Good Will Event, and I felt like packing that mission in 2 episodes was a bit awkward, but that might have just been me. In general, the story structure is very asymetrical and nonlinear, and further in the manga this becomes even more evident. It is Gege Akutami's style to have a very erroneous story structure, which loses a bit of its integrity, but gains in its unpredictability and the way it can force characters into certain types of situations that you were not expecting, and that generally pay-off (like Megumi entering in a brawl, which gives us a glimpse of his past and character in the question ""what is your type of woman""... did not expect that lol
 I give it a 7/10.
Plot:
The original plot device is for Yuuji to consume all 20 Sukuna's fingers and then be executed. But quickly, with the appearence of the special grade curses, the story unfolds into figuring out the bad guys' scheme and stopping them. It's pretty straightforward, but it doesn't need to be complex. It manages to still mantain you at the edge of your seat, keeping you always interested in what is happening in the grand scheme of things. For example, the first thing that baffled me and interested me is how Itadori, the main character, is given a death sentence in the first episode. I was caught totally off guard. And although that sense of danger dilutes as the plot multiplies into subplots and whatnot, the story keeps reminding you that Yuuji's life has its days counted. I think that is very interesting and, if excuted well, can give a huge payoff. It's always difficult to handle this kind of things though, if he dies in the end, everyone will be sad cuz he's dead, but if he doesn't, that whole plotline was kinda useless. Again, it depends. But I digrees. The point is, it's straightforward, but it gets the job done. It keeps you asking questions. What will happen to Yuuji? What do the villains want? How will they deal with Gojou (Shibuya ptsd intensifies, amirite fellow manga readers)? It's functional, and it works, and I personally like it a lot. But, to counter my own bias, I'll give it a 6/10.
So story overall is a 7/10
Power system, worldbuilding and lore:
The premise is simple. Negative emotions that humans give off acumulate, generating cursed energy, and take the form of curses, menacing people-eating demons. Jujutsushi, or Jujutsu sorcerers have learned throughout the ages to manipulate that cursed energy and run it through complicated techniques, in order to fight said curses and protect society. So, a Bleach version of chakra. Great, I guess? It works to certain extent. Cursed energy is very basic and general, and so it doesn't limit the way it can be used. You can come up with pretty creative and unique abilities, and so, the Bleach version of chakra is fine. However, it has something interesting, which is, your technique is either inherited or is born with you. So it's not like anyone can become the strongest Jujutsushi, but that's alright. This isn't Black One Naruto Piece. And this is good for two reasons: characters need to get creative in order to become strong, they're limited by their technique, so they have to resort to other stuff; it reflects the hierarchization and rot of Jujutsu society. You see, the way Jujutsu works is in fact very simple, but over the course of generations and generations of sorcerers, it was improved and grew in complexity. The way this turned out is, some clans monopolized certain techniques, and grew power-thirsty and conceited. We can see this in the Zen'in clan the most, jujutsushiki obsessed fools who'd shun out a young girl just because she was born without cursed energy, or literally buy and sell children because of their inherited cursed technique. So, the Jujutsu world is unfair and inhuman in its higher hierarchies, and the power system reflects it, and that's great. You have different branches of worldbuilding intersecting, which adds greatly to it. That is good writing, when you can infer things about the story from seamlessly innocent and unrelated topics. The second thing is that the characters have to get creative, but first I need to talk about binding vows and heavenly restrictions, my favourite part of JJK's power system, and its most original component. So, in Jujutsu, one of the basic principles, as Sukuna himself explained, is that the two parties establish an agreement. This manifests in many interesting ways, such as binding vows. You agree to something, and if you break it, you suffer dire consequences. You can lose something with that vow, but can also gain something in exchange, and it's that balanced exchange that is such an interesting and great aspect of Jujutsu. Take for example Maki Zen'in, born without cursed energy, but through heavenly restriction, in exchange, she was born with great physical prowess. You quickly see how in Jujutsu, your limitations in certain aspects, can translate into advantages in other aspects, and that leads to an awesome dynamic in fights. It also establishes a clear limiting cap on what you can do in Jujutsu. For example, if you wanna build a barrier that excludes Satoru Gojou, the strongest sorcerer alive, you have to impose that it has to allow everyone else on it. And I just love that kind of stuff. Many say this is just copying Nen in HunterxHunter, but I think that's unfair. Cursed energy has already established itself as its own power system. And this translates to very creative abilities in Jujutsu. If you don't want spoilers for a character ability in the manga, please refrain from reading the following, but i shall omit his/her name to keep the spoilers to a minimum. ((((((There's a Jujutsushi whose cursed technique is controlling crows, which isn't very useful in battle. So, throught a binding vow on the crow, the user forces it to commit suicide, but in return it gains tremendous cursed energy and can damage even high level special grade curses. I mean... How fricking cool is that?)))))) Aditionally, the shonen trope of revealing your technique is, in Jujutsu Kaisen, justified, because you exchange the information you give to your enemy for the power and effectiveness of your technique. 
I could ramble about the power system all day. But onward, to worldbuilding and lore. The worldbuiding is not amazing. Akutami spends little to no time in details about the several branches of JJK world, instead focusing only on the aspects that are relevant to the characters. It's far from being a One Piece, but it also is not bad. It can still keep being interesting, especially when dwelving into the Heian Period and Sukuna's past. As I mentioned in the story component, it's not crazy complete or complex, but it keeps you interested, relatively immersed, and is overall enjoyable. Having these three components in consideration I give it a 9/10. I would concede people giving it an 8 or even a 7 but I just like it so much that I will be biased in this one, since I think this is one of the 3 points where this anime shines.
Fight scenes:
Akutami is a very skilled choreographer and Mappa's animation just exponentiates it further. The fighting sequences are breathtakingly good: they're dynamic, they're explosive, they have high stakes, the different abilities interact nicely, the fights aren't linear, there's always some back and forth (except for Gojou lmao). The only thing that I could point out is that they are often too short, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but sometimes I wish they extended them. And I get it, this is a battle shounen but this isn't the type of anime where one fight can occupy one entire episode (for the most part). Its focus is somewhere else, and that's legit. If a good Naruto fight is like a good wine, a Jujutsu Kaisen fight is like doing cocaine; you have a blast but it's over too soon and suddenly you're addicted . 
I give it a solid 10/10, this is the second category in which JJK excels
Characters: 
This is the 3rd category in which JJK thrives. The. fricking. characters.
JJK utilizes many shounen tropes. See Itadori: your run of the mill braindead happy go lucky mc, with a demon inside of him, who is always yelling and... well wait. He isn't always yelling? Victory for us all. But now seriously, Yuuji really isn't that. He's WAY more nuanced. Yeah he's dumb, but he's aware of it and the author too, as you can see when Toudou bashes his head agaisn't a tree and he asks what he would do if he became dumber than he already is. His main narrative aspect is death. He tries to deal with it and  make sure the ones he loves can have a ""proper death"". Which leads to very interesting discussions. What even is that? Does that even exist? Itadori quickly realises that sometimes, that isn't possible. Sometimes, you get trampled by life, your mom gets murdered, you terrorize a school and get turned into a monster and die regretting it all. Was that a proper death? How was that any different? (PS rip junpei) And yeah, he's a happy go lucky brave fellow... except when he's about to die and shits his pants and regrets saving Fushiguro that one time. I mean... do we see that much nuance in Shounen? Even in anime, it's rare. The character is GROUNDED. Yeah, it's a magical battle shounen, but the character's ideals, convictions and personalities feels very REAL. And this isn't only limited to Yuuji. JJK has a huge quantity of tremendously nuanced characters: Gojou, Jogo, Mahito, Junpei, Nobara, Nanami, and others not yet seen or explored in anime, like Geto or Yuuta. And this is intentional. Akutami for example has said that he tries to choose common names, that regular people would have. Which doesn't refrain from those names encapsulating the characters motifs, like Gojou Satoru having kanji  signifying enlightenment. Gojou is other beast of a character. The paroxysm of force, yet he chooses to nourish others, recognizing the individual's impotence in applying lasting change in the world. The other aspect that I have to mention, and you probably saw it from miles away, but the female characters are handled RIGHT. They aren't hyper-sexualized, the focus isn't in the romantic atraction between the male and female characters, they also have nuanced, distinct and well written personalities and are absolute badasses when it comes to fights. The author treats them as people, they aren't written there because the show needed some pink-haired love interest. They're there because they're characters that Akutami thought of, and so he wrote them. And this, in Shounen, is ground breaking. Yeah, you can find some anime like AoT that also treat the female characters nicely, but it's still rare. The main take away is, you won't find crazy complex people in JJK. Their ideologies are not a philosophy loop roundabout like idk the way people describe Eren Jaeger (although I don't really agree but whatever) or the OG characters like Light from Death Note or Guts from Berserk. But, in their complexity, ranging from medium to decently high, they are mature, grounded and real. I could go on and on about how I felt, for example, in Junpei's final scenes and his character arc in general. When he burst into tears saying he didn't believe people had hearts becaus he couldn't bear that people could curse him with those hearts, you FEEL that. That despair is real. You look around in the real world and you can recognize, not only intelectually, but emotionally woth what he is talking about and you resonate with it. And that is masterful emotional and intelectual character writing. 
All in all, I would give this category 10/10. But I realise that there's some points in there that reflect how I feel and have grown to love these characters.  So let's give it a veeeery high 8, or a 9/10, I think that is fair.
Comedy:
JJK is one of the only shounen that does this category right. And what I mean by that is that every time a comedic sequence comes up, I don't wanna kill myself and my whole family, like when I'm watching Black Clover. Basicly, JJK doesn't try too hard. The problem with comedy in Shounen, wether you like it in a particular show or not, is how it interrupts and diverts your attention to the scene. For example, when Naruto spends entire sequences around how Jiraya is a huge pervert (seriously, someone call the FBI jesus christ), what does that add to the story or the characters? That Jiraya is a huge pervert and Naruto is more mature than him, and that's funny cuz haha a kid is more mature than a grown man and it's funny when old men harass young women haha. And how important is the fact that Jiraya is a huge pervert? Not much. Certainly not enough for five minutes of a perverted comedic skit. You see what I mean? Jujutsu Kaisen doesn't do that. The comedy is light and short. It draws from a lot of pop culture references, it doesn't distract you from the main point of the action, and further characterizes the people involved, serving for some pretty wholesome, lighthearted and funny moments that just makes you love the characters even more. And that's what comedy in Shounen needs to be. 
Now, granting that not every one will find those moments funny because everyone has a different sense of humor, I will give it a 9/10. It may be too high for your taste, but it also doesn't matter that much to the overall value of the show; I just thought it relevant to the overall enjoyment
Animation, sound, etc:
MAPPA. Do I need to say anything more? The work done was superb. That's it. The animation was amazing, the visuals were mesmerizing, and the way they animated certain moments just made me get the chiiiills (like when Yuuji asks if Hanami is friends with a patched face curse and his eye flickers with cold rage. Just. Damn) The only point where the anime adaptation could have gone better is perhaps the sound. Not the openings (Kaikai Kitan slaps tbh) or the intermission music thingies, but the soundtracks for the action scenes were just mid or not very good, also seemed like they were used pretty randomly. 
I give this category 9/10 because of that.
So, to wrap this up. Is Jujutsu Kaisen overhyped? Definitely. Is it underhyped? For sure. But outside of that, it is a fresh, thoughtfully written shounen, with good likeable characters, interesting and mature themes, beautiful vibrant and colorful visuals, mesmerizing fight scenes and interesting abilities. If you, as myself, enjoy Shounen, if that's your main dish, I would say pretty confidently that Jujutsu Kaisen is a solid 9/10. If however Shounen is not your cup of tea, and you look at it purely as a piece of fiction, it hovers around 7/10.",9,LuluKawaii17

                Spoiler-free should-you-watch review of season 1:
I'll keep this short and sweet, I find this to be a horror-tinted less endearing version of Boku no Hero Academia. The animation is great, but the writing is not. I enjoyed the first season, but I'm not dying to see the second.
The horror is sweet. The idea of the main character is fun. Some of the powers are very cool, and feel like they have a gravity to their use. The ending animation is a lot of fun. It scratches the shonen-male-protagonist-is-the-chosen-kid-and-does-the-thing-in-spite-of-great-odds itch, but in a way that makes me painfully aware I'm being scratched.
It's not horrible by any
                  means, but the plot often feels like it's just going through the motions, checking off the tropes, and raking in the yen. I can't describe the sensation well, but I'll try: Jujutsu Kaisen feels like a shonen anime-by-committee, which is super weird since it's ostensibly quite fresh by appearances.
It's also strangely aloof, like they're trying to deviate from the formula, but in a way that just brings attention to itself. Exposition, world-building... an issue that I've had with some modern anime is that they feel like they don't want to tell the same introductory story as other anime (especially if it's modern day), so they just don't, or they half-ass it. Instead of being relieved that I'm skipping boilerplate exposition, I'm left having a hard time empathizing with characters' decisions. It has a quality to it that frequently reminds you there will be more seasons when you just want to be focusing on the show. But that's only an issue because it's the first season, and I think they're leaning on that a bit.
So yeah. Watch it, it's cool, MAPPA did a good job. The first season alone isn't the strongest, but I get the feeling it will get better over time.",7,Myrmiderp
40748,"
                Alright, so let me preface this by saying Jujutsu Kaisen is a damn good anime. I'll start by talking about its good points, since it has a lot of them. 
The art is fluid and the fight scenes (already) are damn incredible and a blast to watch. With such fluid animation most people would be sold already. I mean damn, your average teenage anime watcher would probably praise this as a masterpiece. The manga is pretty close to incredible, but the anime so far? Ehh, pretty damn good too.
The sound is godlike. Everyone loves the OP. I'm no exception. Kaikai Kitan by E ve characterizes
                  the show wonderfully, and as a Japanese speaker, it was hard at first to sing the lyrics but now they flow out of my mouth as fluidly as the godlike animation. Incredible song choice, and a 10 in that department. VAs perform incredibly well, and I have to say, Yuuji's VA carries his character heavy! As for everything else, you can expect good sound throughout and this is by no means an overstatement.
The one part where I do have to tick points off for is the story. It's basically a typical shounen storyline right? Well, not quite, but that doesn't make it good. You basically get a knock-off Team 7 from Naruto, but I prefer the characters a bit more. With that being said, you get Mr. Itadori Yuuji who just ingests some powerful dark energy and becomes OP, and then an emo guy and then a good looking female who actually is kinda strong. Her ability is really well animated; it takes creativity to come up with that. Gojou is pretty overpowered, and is basically the god of the series, who everyone adores. You can think of him as a backwards Kakashi Sensei, as he doesn't really wear a mask, but he covers his eyes. His hair's white too though, so I guess there's some inspiration there. Both of them are OP, but compared to the power scaling of their respective worlds, Gojou is a lot higher up on the power scale. I love Gojou, but you gotta admit, he's not too far off from Kakashi himself. I like his personality a bit more though. So far, I don't really love the worldbuilding, but the concept of domains is pretty cool. I like that part. Abilities are solid for each character too, so nothing to knock off there.
Although I kinda talked about how I didn't think the character and story writing was god tier, I still have to admit, I have a blast watching each and every episode. It's really enjoyable for the younger audience, and is definitely a shounen that many will admire. Will it be as popular as new gen shounens like BNHA and KNY? It's tough to say, but if I had to guess, probably not? Is it as good as the two? Probably not, but I enjoy it a lot more than the aforementioned shounens. 
Overall, do yourself a favor and indulge in the well-animated, brilliant sounding, and decent story of Jujutsu Kaisen. Solid 8/10 for me!",8,rishisant

                So I finally watched this anime after all the rave and high score it received. Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY. Did I like it as much as others? Eehhhh...it's definitely good, don't get me wrong. I recommend you watch it because it's one of the better shounen animes to come out in a while. It's not original by any means, but there are a few twist here and there that makes the show good. I'll do my 2 favorite positives and 2 most negative takes.
Postive 1: Satoru Gojo. Dude steals the show. He's hilarious and ridiculously OP. He's up there with the best sensei's in
                  anime history. Hope to see more of him in season 2.
Postive 2: The character interactions are really good. Each individual does a great job bouncing off one another with jokes and dialogues. They actually speak like real people at times and not something you'd expect in an anime, which is refreshing. I think the best one at this is one of the MC's teammate, Nobara. She carries the team in terms of making them likable.
Negative 1: This show has one of the thicker plot armors in recent history. But given that it does classify as a shounen, you'd expect it. Is the armor as thick as Fairy Tale? Hmmm...it's close. It's not just Satoru that is OP, every single member is ""special"" and can already take the bigger baddies down one on one. There's very little danger because you already know the heroes will never lose. So it does make the action scenes rather dull- despite the choreography and animation to be pretty good. Itadori, the MC, in general has ridiculous plot armor. The dude could be fired into the sun and I don't think he'd die. 
Negative 2: Does a poor job explaining how any of their magic/technique works. I mean, the show does try- you get to know what ""curses"" are, but other than that....whenever something extraordinary happens, you're just like..ok that happened, cool. It's not just that though- a few humans are strong as hell. I'm talking they aren't even enhanced or using magic- mofo can chase down a speeding car, jump over buildings, and punch through a foot of concrete like it was just another Monday. At this point you gotta ask yourself- if regular humans are already that strong, what's even the point of having ""curse"" powers? See? I told you the good guys are OP.
Over all though, it's still worth a watch- just to see what the hype is about. I would say you'll be bored 40% of the time, actually paying attention 20%, and the other 40% you'll be confused and just trying to enjoy the animation. Have fun!",8,Banana-Pudding

                This review is spoiler free.
Jujutsu Kaisen, much like Kimetsu no Yaiba back in 2019, is the newest big shonen blast that everyone who is even remotely familiar with anime knows. Is it overhyped? Absolutely. But does that make it a bad show? Not at all.
Story - 7 (Good)
The story of Jujutsu Kaisen is nothing new. A young, cheerful and a bit silly male protagonist, Yuuji Itadori, eats one of the fingers of a powerful curse known as Sukuna Ryoumen, giving him supernatural powers, but with the cost of carrying Sukuna inside him. He soon joins Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, where he gets to
                  become a Jujutsu sorcerer and to collect more of Sukuna's fingers in order for the sorcerers to eventually defeat him. The story is very simple from beginning to end, nothing we haven't seen before in battle shonen. But it executes the simple premise very well, and never feels too slow or boring. The fight scenes are enjoyable, giving us some classic shonen hype but also introducing some interesting strategies and concepts. Overall, it's a classic shonen story done very well.
Art - 9 (Great)
Animated by Studio MAPPA, Jujutsu Kaisen is one of the most visually gorgeous new gen anime shows. The action choreography is great, power effects look nice, character designs work really well for the show. Compared to the somewhat sketchy artwork of the original manga, I think the anime does a much better job bringing the characters and fights to life.
Sound - 8 (Very Good)
The music in Jujutsu Kaisen is great, opening and ending songs are very nice and good fits for the show, especially the op for second half of the season. Voice acting is overall good and the sound design does it's job. Nothing to complain here.
Character - 6 (Fair)
For me, this is the weakest aspect of the show. Yuuji is a fine character, likable and all, but he's just the same old shonen mc we've seen so many times before. Megumi is a ""cool and quiet"" type of character and Nobara is a strong, tsundere-ish young woman. And then there's Gojou, the fan favorite of this show, who is entertaining and provides some great moments. But in my opinion, the saving grace of this series' cast are it's supporting characters. While the main trio doesn't offer much, side characters like Nanami, Toudou, Maki and of course Panda are way more interesting and have some of the best moments in the series overall.
Enjoyment - 8 (Very Good)
With all it's cliches and familiar shonen tropes, Jujutsu Kaisen is a very enjoyable experience if you're a fan of battle shonen. It's also a great gateway anime for people who aren't familiar with the medium already. Don't expect anything mind blowing or revolutionary, just go with the flow and enjoy the action.
Overall - 8 (Very Good)
Jujutsu Kaisen is an action packed mix of familiar shonen tropes, great fight scenes, interesting mysteries and banger music, all tied up by the outstanding animation. Visuals are definitely carrying this show, and it really doesn't deserve to be called a masterpiece, but it's a great ride all the way through nonetheless.",8,Weebbe

                In all honesty my expectations for Jujutsu Kaisen were not that high. Well that's an understatement. My expectations for Jujutsu Kaisen were very low. I just assumed it was another over-hyped shounen which we have been getting a lot of recently. To my surprise I was very wrong. Jujutsu Kaisen was a very good anime, altough it still had it's fair share of cliches. Well I guess every shonen has cliches so I can forgive Jujutsu Kaisen for that.
The thing that surprised me the most about this anime was definitely the characters. Unlike in a lot of shounen the characters in Jujutsu Kaisen were actually
                  likeable. Yuuji, the main character, is nothing like most other shounen protagonists. What I mean by this is that he isn't a little bitch who constantly cries over every single mistake, instead he acts like an actual, likeable human being (very surprising I know). Nobara does act somewhat like a typical female character in shounen, but she's not nearly as annoying and much more likable. Megumi is the calm and smart guy in the trio. I really wish that we got to see more of his backstory, but I guess they had to keep some things secret for the second season. 
The plot of Jujutsu Kaisen is almost generic and similar plots can be found in a lot of shounen. But honestly I don't view that as a flaw since it was good and enjoyable, I just wish it expanded more on to some things. I have to mention Jujutsu Strolls which were at the end of each episode. They were funny as fuck. At first I wasn't a really big fan, they really grew on me. (I know that this doesn't really have anything to do with the plot but I had to write it somewhere.)
Honestly my biggest dissapointement about this anime was that we didn't see more of Sukuna. The further the anime progresses Sukuna starts appearing less and less, and by the end of the anime we almost never see him. 
Also just to mention the art and animation. They were, to simply put it, incredible and made this anime really stand out. MAPPA has definitely outdone itself.
In short Jujutsu Kaisen is a great anime. I'd really recommend that you watch it even if you aren't really into shounen.",9,UnknownGhost5

                This is an overhyped series with nothing to offer. Awful animation style, dull characters, weak power system and abilities. That dude tudou has to play patty cake by himself for his ability to work, pathetic. that girl nobara is walking uncreativity, hammer and nails? I got that in my garage man. the mc is boring to watch on screen and it sucks cause that's the mc. Gojo is the worst thing to have ever happened because people be comparing him to kakashi when he doesn't do anything. his attacks are basic and people act like they never seen colors change before, its exhausting to see
                  everyone eat up the same trash scenes over and over. I skipped straight to the end just to find out it took 24 episodes for some real interesting stuff to happen, but by that point I was already done with the series. I stopped caring at episode 7, visually the best episode, but that can't carry a 24 episode series, so it going in the dumpster with the others. If anyone is reading this, just drop the series already to save yourself some time.",1,SixPathsMarcus

                I can't claim to be an anime expert, nor a professional critic, however, I have to say that Jujutsu Kaisen is one of my favourite animes of all time.
The main reason I say this is because of the characters. Out of all the animes I've watched, I would say that Jujutsu Kaisen has by far some of the best-written characters. Itadori isn't like many of the typical protagonists I've seen, who are seeking to achieve a goal of vengeance against a powerful foe. Instead, he's a boy who's had a relatively good childhood and has a very simple yet resonating goal: to save as many
                  people as he can, and protect his friends. The light-hearted energy that Itadori emulates, alongside his childlike humour makes him an extremely likeable character, and I dare say one of my favourites in the whole show.
Nobara is also another character I absolutely adore. She isn't the typical fanservice female character who only serves as someone who needs to be protected by other male characters. Nobara can hold her own and has demonstrated herself as an extremely valuable asset in a fight, even alongside her male peers. However regardless of this fact, Nobara isn't a typical ""tomboy"" character and does not completely reject her femininity, nor does she shame other women who want to be feminine themselves. Nobara demonstrates to all the young girls watching that a woman can be both strong, and feminine and that the two do not oppose each other. She serves as an amazing example of what a real woman is like, a person with multiple sides to her, not just fitting into some 2D stereotypical box.
Another thing I absolutely loved about this show was the relationship between our three main characters (Nobara, Yuuji, and Megumi). Unlike a lot of other animes I've seen where some sort of complicated love triangle is woven into a trio like this, these friends clearly demonstrate a platonic love for each other. Even though there are no romantic connotations, you can feel just how close they are and how much they care for each other. There are very few misunderstandings, and the three have great communication and sincerely believe in the abilities of the others. However regardless of how close they are, it still feels platonic, and I feel that is a feeling that many shows fail to communicate. That warm and comforting feeling of true friendship was something that really struck a chord with me.
It's also great how viewers can visibly notice GRADUAL character development, and there are no sudden changes within 1-2 episodes. We're able to see just how Yuuji, Megumi and Nobara evolve over time and how all of these big events shape them into the people they are by the end of the season. By reading Gojo's past arc in the manga, you're also able to see the drastic difference between 16-year old Gojo, and the Gojo of today, and exactly how he came to be that way.
Finally, I just love how all of the characters are a bit crazy and eccentric. First and foremost, it makes the show a whole lot more interesting and jarring, which I really enjoy, but it also acts as a reflection of their past. Most jujutsu sorcerers have been treated as outcasts due to being ""different"" in some manner, and after suffering for so many years the majority of these sorcerers have just said ""f*ck it"" and started to live for themselves instead of trying to please others. Even those with relatively calm demeanours like Megumi have demonstrated a crazy side.

                While the series is alot of fun, sometimes.
Most of the characters are, terriblly dull.
The only real characters to care about are Gojou, Yuuji, Sukuna, Aoi and Mahito.
For scene's without them you can safely turn the playback speed to 2x.
Let's hope for more of them if there are future seasons.
So yeah, these character's stories are great, its a shame the overall story is dragged down by having to follow the other character's stories.
The art is great.
The sound is great.
The characters on average are meh.Its quite enjoyable, sometimes.

                OOOOOOH BOY! Where to begin? Jujutsu Kaisen is one of the best newest anime I have ever seen! You have the lovable yet kinda dumb and badass protagonist Yuji, the goofy and relaxed teacher Gojo, the bombshell beauty who could kick my ass any day of the week Nobara, and sooo many others. The fight scenes are very well choreographed and well animated, especially in the last episode. The story is also intricate and well made. I was kind of unsure about the show, but I really loved it. This show is a must watch. Also, Nobara is best waifu!

                Story
Nothing remarkable about the story. The world building is nothing to write home about either. Basically does not do much to make it stand out with other shounen series. The pacing can be very off many times as well. It is crazy to think that so little of note can happen throughout the course of several episodes, things could have defintiely been better paced. Also found flashbacks in the middle of battles to detract from the overall viewing experience. The characters explaining their techniques were also tiresome at times. The comedy falls flat most of the time since many gags are repeated. 
Art
The art style
                  and animation is definitely good. MAPPA is really flexing their budget through out the battles especially. 
Sound
Excellent ending theme song ""Lost in Paradise"". First opening is pretty decent as well. The second opening and ending are definitely not as memorable. The music that plays throughout the battles is also good. 
Character
Definitely a weak point for the series. If the story couldn't hold up, perhaps the characters can make up for it. Not the case for this series. The main character is bland for a main character, the same can be said for the other main characters other than Gojo. They seem more like side characters from other series than main characters due to their lack of personality. Gojo does not get nearly as much screen time but makes more of an impression. Supporting characters also do not add much to the overall story either. 
Enjoyment
I had high hopes for this series. The story started off well enough, but as it goes on, the story starts to drag. Some episodes go nowhere very quickly and I was not overly invested in what was going on. The tournmanet battle arc took way too long to resolve. I did not find the battles very entertaining either. Characters did not hold my interest for too long either. 
Overall
I found myself dissapointed with this series. I was expecting much more, but  got a fairly average anime at best. The ending song was the most memorable part of watching this series, but I would not go out of my way to recommend this series. I think I might be too old and jaded to enjoy shounen anime anymore",5,Awoo4U

                Quote-  I don't know how I'll feel when I'm dead, But I don't want to regret the way I lived.
TL;DR-  High schooler Itadori Yuuji is roped into fighting powerful cursed spirits after a bad encounter during his occult club duties. The club accidentally encounters a powerful curse which itadori resorts to eating and finding out that it was sukunaas fingers, sukuna being the most op curse to every have existed and who cannot be destroyed. Yuuji’s luck contains to worsen as his life is now on the line as the jujutsu board wants to kill him to retrieve sukunas finger, but itadori chooses
                  to find the rest of sukunas fingers before he is killed.
 Similar- Bleach supernatural good fights, strong mc, blue exorcist, both mcs were normal but now have demon inside, forced to transfer to another school, shonen
Art- Mappa outdid themselves with the animation and set a new standard for shounen/ fight focused animes, The impacts, subtle animation ques, abstract camera angles and flow of each scene stitch beautifully together to make a very enjoyable watch experience . Although there is gore, this darker animation style is showed in an all-expense paid beauty without any censorship. Truly captivating to watch as its smooth and blends well with the story.
Music- One of the best of fall 2020, slick opening song and ending song and are certified bangers. OP is extremely catchy with ed having a contrasting yet similar catchy style to it. The animations for both op and ed are on point
VA-  Superb with some famous VAs included. VA for gojou was perfectly chosen as his other roles include being the va for tatsuya in irregular at magic high school. Sukunas va does an excellent job at sending chills down your spine whilst exerting the most swagger known to man. Noburas VA doesn’t sound wimpy like you'd expect out of a shounen anime, she sounds determined and fierce which just shows how you can get a female lead correct rather than her just being waifu fodder.
Themes 
From the Mahito arc, that is from ep 9 to 13 covering chapters 19 to 31 of the manga, the central theme is betrayal. Special grade cursed spirit Mahito is seemingly a relatively young cursed spirit as shown by his curiosity and lack of self-control. He describes himself as being born from human sins and so considers himself as a manifestation of human hatred. He shows no sympathy for human lives and believes like the other special grade cursed spirits that humans should be replaced with cursed spirits. Nanami also went as far as to describe mahito as being similar to gojo in the sense that both are extremely immature and have a superficial nature. Now mahito befriends junpie because he's interested in how far he could take this new toy. He coerces junpie into becoming a curse user by using his hatred for others and when junpie outlives his worth, he uses him as leverage against yuuji showing the utter disrespect to humans that mahito has. You can only be easily persuaded by someone if you have a predisposition to that thought. What im trying to say is that you cant persuade me to buy a boat if i live in the middle of a city like toronto for example but you may be able to persuade me to buy a new phone if the one i have is slowly dying. Say I own an iphone 8 that has battery problems and touch id has stopped working, and you have an iphone 11 to sell. I may actually buy that iphone 11 just because i'm already thinking of getting a replacement in the first place so i'm predisposed to that idea. Furthermore, research done by dr robert cialdini and steve martin showed that there are six main principles of persuasion- reciprocity, scarcity, authority, consistency, liking and consensus. Reciprocity is the idea that people feel more obliged to give back to others if they have received something. In 1971, a researcher by the name of Dennis Regan tested the strength of  two aspects of reciprocity in a study where participants believed they were in an art appreciation experiment with a partner, Joe, who was really Regan's assistant. During the experiment, Joe would disappear and bring back a soft drink for the participant. After this phase of the experiment was over, Joe would ask the participant to buy raffle tickets from him. The more the participants liked Joe, the more likely they were to buy raffle tickets from him. However, when Joe had given them a soda and thus indebted them to reciprocate, it made no difference whether the participants liked Joe or not, the rule of reciprocity overpowered liking. Another study found out that giving diners a mint of all things increases the chance of getting a higher tip by 3%. If two mints are given however, the tip increases by 14%. This goes further as saying “For you nice people, here’s an extra mint,” makes tips go up by 23%. This is the power of reciprocity. Mahito is also an authoritative figure for junpei. There are many examples of people being blinded by authority, for example Eichmenn, the man behind the planning of efficient collection transportation and extermination of the jewish in 1940s was surprised that the jewish hated him. In an extract quoted from Eichmann’s jail diary he said that 'The orders were, for me, the highest thing in my life and I had to obey them without question'  In his eyes he had merely obeyed orders so thought he was doing the correct thing. In another study done by Milgram found out that authority has a major part to play in a persons willingness to do something against their own subconscious. The experiment goes as follows. Participants were led to believe that they were assisting an unrelated experiment, in which they had to administer electric shocks to a ""learner."" These fake electric shocks gradually increased to levels that would have been fatal had they been real. 65% of those in the experiment administered the 450 volt person killing shock. This again goes to show that authority can blind us from what we want to do. For Junpei, mahito gave him hope. Junpie was an apathetic nihilistic teen who was at the butt end of being bullied and Mahito gave him a mysterious power that could allow him to even the playing field. This causes Junpei to trust him even more and so become even more willing to follow what mahito says as he's been the light at the end of the tunnel for junpei ever since he gave him the powers. He’s given junpei the massive gift of using cursed spirits so he tries to repay him by being more willing and accepting of mahito, even going as far as to telling yuuji that mahito is not a bad person before being disfigured by the same person he just showed respect to. This is probably the ultimate betrayal and causes Yuuji to go on a rampage set on killing mahito.

Thoughts
Overall, I enjoyed this anime as it tied in the gruesome aspects of being part of a world where people have to be willing and able to throw their lives away without any praise and die alone. The entire anime is a crisp package of the frailty of life and the mangaka did an excellent job writing this story even if it seems like it has a lot of stylistic cues from other anime cough naruto cough. All in all, this anime showed how easily we could be persuaded if the necessary conditions are met. Take a moment to realise that we shouldn’t be easily persuaded into doing things that go against what we believe as we live with the decisions that we make, not those who try to persuade us.",9,LeviathanHWD

                Mid-Air Review! I will attempt to keep this concise, just stating this here but I do have the bias of liking this anime so I may fudge some stuff. I will attempt to give it a decent overview.
To begin I would like to state that I didn't really expect much from this show the first couple of episodes. I kept with it because of its visual themes of body horror and jokes that landed for me. Though as the show went on I began to see some themes show through that can be enjoyable for those who are looking for deeper media as well. 
Pros
                  of Jujutsu Kaisen:
- Comedy (the jokes were pretty good in my opinion however humor is highly subjective)
- smooth animation
- smooth animation that stays smooth and gorgeous throughout fight scenes
- interesting ability mechanics
- Genuine Themes
- Thought provoking dialogue (if you let it be)
Cons:
- Body horror (if you do not enjoy this then the show isn't for you, if you do then enjoy)
- comedy (if you don't enjoy it)
- Sporadic story telling (not to the point of not understanding but more so when
- Characters feel empty until given attention
Story (7):
Okay, so I gave this a 7 starting off simply because even though it is easy to follow and not necessarily bad it doesn't break the mold. It is a fairly simple structure of cause and effect. The characters are consistently reacting to the environment around them and this can lead to story telling that feels sporadic and handed to the main cast at times. It also at times can feel quite fast and problems can be solved extremely soon after being presented. The narratives can feel very episodic until a certain point in the series. I personally felt this was off putting but not enough to refrain from watching.
Art (10):
I gave art a 10 because the art style emulates the manga well and the animation is so smooth when it needs to be and dialed back when it doesn't. The direction at first for this show felt a bit odd but from the beginning this show was good at balancing its animation. The animation was on point when it felt best and was low effort but still visually appealing when comedy sketches were occurring. The art style for the show doesn't stand out too much but it does tend to have characteristics that make it unique and worth watching. These characteristics can be found through the abilities. Outside of that it is fairly standard but not ugly. 
Sound (7):
First off the soundtrack is good. Not really bad and not something extremely memorable, it does a good job of making scenes land and doesn't distract me like some have. 
The voice acting however is very good (for sub I have not watched dub). All of the performances feel good and natural for these characters. The main character Yuuji's voice actor does a particularly well job in my opinion conveying angsty moments without having them feel cliché. 
Character (7):
I love them all they are my children. Though I will warn that they are pretty textbook examples of multi dimensional characters. In this I mean all of them so far have been shown to be an archetype but have individually had those archetypes refuted by background information. This isn't necessarily bad it just has felt very forthright for me. I will say however that the cast minus the main character, the main characters tutor, and a certain villain are fairly forgettable. Certain big characters don't necessarily have the impact I feel they should. However this is a mid way review and there is still time for these characters to be fleshed out and made feel different. 
Enjoyment (9):
Overall however the story is fairly pleasurable to follow and I've had impactful moments with it. It has reminded me of some personal philosophies and lead me to fleshing out other points in my thinking. It also is a show that I feel is capable of being savored when watching. I find myself eagerly waiting for each episode as it releases and not missing releases by any more than a day. This is a show that you can easily get into cheering for the characters and wishing them luck or wishing for them to get beat up.
Overall (9):
Overall I think that the genuine vibes that I get from this anime make me really enjoy it and its characters even if technically speaking it isn't the next best thing or innovative. Not everything really needs to be and this show is an example of something that you can watch and enjoy without it being something new or over the top amazing. It feels down to earth with realistic and enjoyable characters and decent comedy.",9,sleebyprince

                I'm not really good at reviewing, since I rate everything too high. I personally don't really give anything lower than a 7, so I don't think my review will be much help.
Jujutsu Kaisen, the anime everyone has been raving about since the first trailer back in June/July. 
This anime has been hyped up and will continue to be hyped up, so I am going to try to be as realistic as possible..
Watch this. This anime is truly one of the few that lives up to its hype. Lately, I have been feeling drained, and can't even bring myself to finish a 12 episode anime, however,
                  the moment I watched this, I was hooked. I binged all 13 episodes in 4-5 hours. 
The power system is unique. It isn't your typical ""magic"". It has it's whole different rating system and it's own power source that is something that I have never seen before.
~~~~
Story: 10/10. I love the storyline. It doesn't include your typical MC who is weak and can't really do anything until they meet someone. Yuuji was already excelling in combat and his reflexes were top notch. It was just added on to. Also, the episodes aren't too boring it's like a filler, but it's not packed with too much information your brain is going to explode. It balances them out well, and it also adds some comedy to give your head a break from processing so much information.
Art: 9.5/10. I love the way the magic looks. It's so pretty it reminds me of Mononoke in a way. With the paper/canvas type visual. I also love how pretty everyone's eyes are, especially Gojo's. But they're not Kyoani amazing, but they're actually really nice. 
Sound: 9/10. The opening and the ending are definitely something you'll listen to if you're jogging, going to the gym or even gaming. They're both good.
Character: 9.8/10. The characters are pretty cliche, your nice caring MC who can't kill anyone, your quiet black haired deuteragonist, and your tsundere female lead. But, this anime took your basic cliche characters and made them into enjoyable ones. Especially the females. Most females in shounen anime are made to rely on the MC, or to become possible love interests, but that's not the case. All the females here are reliable and can do things themselves.
Now, I want to talk about this one character that will appear in episode 9 and a little bit in the op. Junpei. Junpei's character is relatable due to his backstory. And his character overall was used for development of the MC, but it really showed how people will rely on someone horrible, when they're in pain or need some light in their life. And it also showed that there will be times people important to you, or someone you idolize will backstab you.
Junpei's line, ""if there was a button I could press that would kill everyone I hate, I wouldn't press it. But, if there was a button I could press that would kill everyone who hates me, I'd press it."" really stuck with me, and is something I will remember forever.
Enjoyment: 10/10. As I said previously, I was able to binge this in 4-5 hours, regardless of me going through a phase where I could barely watch a 12 episode anime.
Overall: 9/10. The only reason I haven't given this a 10 is because it's only been 13 episodes, and I want to see how MAPPA will display the tournament arc, because tournament arcs are my favorite. But if MAPPA does make this arc a truly good one, I will rate it a 10/10.",9,Svephiroth

                JJK is definetely the shonen trend, this year. Though many people may compare the charecters of JJK and previous shonens, some of my own friends once compared it, which brought sadness. As I have read the manga and respect the author's work.
Story: The story normally starts of cliche, but as it keeps progressing it never got boring and with certainty I can tell that the story has entertained all types of audiences. 
Charecters: The charecters are also a strong point of JJK, one of my friends compared Satoro Gojo to Kakashi which was depressing remembering, Yuji Itadori may seem cliche but his charecter is written

                Jujutsu Kaisen just ended so here you get a review. Jujutsu Kaisen has been one of the most hyped shows this season and it is pretty good.
Story: I think the story of Jujutsu Kaisen is very good and it is a very uniqe plot for a shounen and if you conpare it to other new age shounen (demon slayer and black clover mainly) and it is super refreshing (especially when you think of all the isekai that we get tons of every year) i love the setting and i had a realy hard time waiting every week and i realy got engaged by it. Minus
                  is that i’m not the biggest fan of the power system but i can develop.
Art: I think the art is amazing i mean it’s MAPPA so it’s obvioulsy realy good i think the character desingn is realy good. And overall it’s a beatuy for your eyes.
Sound: The two op’s are amazing and the two ed’s are even better (especially the first). The voice acting is realy good especially Yuuichi Nakamura’s voice acting of Gojou is amazing and Asami Seto’s voice acting of Kugisaki Nobara is fantastic. However Junya Enoki isn’t the best voice actor to voice Itadori he is an amazing voice actor (he did Pannacota in JoJo) p.5) but overall the sound is realy good.
Characters: The characters of Jujutsu Kaisen is good but definetly overrated in my opinion i don’t hate any of them i think Gojou and Megumi are realy good characters but Kugisaki and Itadori are pretty ’meh’ but i think all of the characters have potential to develop. I think the supporting characters are pretty good but i think all of them have potential.
Enjoyment: I think it was overrated so that is a minus but i enjoyed it every week but i still think it was overrated.
Overall: I think it was very good it is a uniqe shounen and i realy like so i think it was realy good and i will definetly read the manga and i’m hyped for season two.",8,Polkaboy157

                The anime might was overrated but not overrated mean they're bad. This anime deserve the hype more than Demon Slayer in my opinion.
The animation was movie level, the story was great and the character designs are badass (especially Gojou). Even the opening/ending are so good.
The anime isnt masterpiece level yet but so far, there seems to be no downside or lackluster found from the anime. So no complain can be found. Even if there is, it might depend on each individual preferences. 
Looking forward for the announced movie. Hope it didnt get delayed as long as Demon Slayer...

                This show is another case of top tier shonen action. Cool story, interesting characters, and an awesome power system that makes me want to look up how it works more. The soundtrack for this show hits every time and the animation is quality. The fight choreography is so cool too. The way the characters fight, move, and strategize to out smart their opponent is amazing. 
Now that I have finished gushing about this show for a paragraph I highly recommend it. I had a really good time with this show. I watched it as it aired and the show continued to impress me. A lot
                  of my friends that do not usually keep up with newer shows tuned into this show and could not stop talking about how great it is. This is a must watch if you are a shonen action fan.",10,stevieB1618

                Just a reminder my English is very bad and this review will be spoiler-free.
It was really difficult to find some quality anime last year. It was full of romcom and some isekai anime. Jujutsu Kaisen really enlightens my last year in the field of anime. If you like supernatural shounen anime with some epic fights and dark content then it's perfect for you.
Story:
This series's concept or plot is very simple as far as I saw in this season yet quite amazing. It is also mature shounen anime for its dark content. It's not any cheerful shounen there are many tragic, violent, mythical and grueling plot.
                  although besides the mythical fact the world-building is pretty similar to the modern world. There are 6 arcs in this season. MAPPA adapted them perfectly and I enjoyed all of them. The storyline of this series is developing consecutively. Interested in the 2nd season also the movie which will premiere next winter.
Art:
I think this best animation is done so far. The fight scenes and the character design are animated perfectly. There are some top-notch fights and the character designs are well detailed.
Sound:
there are 2 opening and ending themes. These theme songs are the best have seen so far and they also are hit.
Character:
Each of them had a great influence. The personality, impact, presence, contribution, power of every character are well detailed.
Enjoyment:
If you are a shounen or action anime fan then you will definitely enjoy this series. It has great fight scenes, power scenes, epic moments, amazing character and a superb plot.
It will be no surprise it will become one of the next top-tier shounen genre anime like one piece, naruto, Hunter X Hunter 2011 etc.",10,rein4444

                Man I love shounen. Nine times out of ten, the trick to making a good one is implementing just enough new “pizzazz” to differentiate it from everything else. Jujutsu Kaisen is the rare case where a show doesn’t really do anything different, but still sees a ton of success. You’ve got super powers, monsters, and an organization/school training kids to fight those monsters with those super powers. The only new thing JK does is put the villain inside the MC’s body, but even then, the villain only makes a handful of appearances. So why is JK so popular?
In my opinion, it’s the production value and
                  the characters. As I’m sure most others will mention, the animation quality is pretty high throughout the series. The art is consistently very pretty, and while some movements can look a little choppy, there are several high-quality fights throughout the show. One fight in particular took HALF the episode’s run time, and it was amazing. The OP’s and ED’s are incredible too, though the first half’s set is much better than the second half’s imo. 
Now you can polish a turd super nice, but at the end of the day, it’s still gonna be a turd. Production values are great, but they’re only one piece of the puzzle. The other, arguably larger piece, is the characters. The side characters, in particular, are a treat. Gojo is a pretty boy troll that usually steals the spotlight when he’s on-screen. Nanami had a touching backstory I really appreciated, and I LOVE Maki. Probably because she’s got some Rock Lee vibes going on (no powers but still strong), and he’s one of my favorite characters of all time. Toudou is really fucking funny, as well entertaining to watch. And Miwa is best girl. Most of them don’t have super complicated backstories, they’re just really fun to watch. They do cool shit or they’re being goofballs. I like seeing characters being goofballs, it makes them feel so much more real. Perhaps that’s just a preference thing. Odds are, you’ll find someone to latch onto in this show. 
Last thing I want to mention are the “Jutsu Strolls,” short stories played at the end of an episode. Some of these shorts are forgettable, but the good ones are either hilarious or heartwarming. My favorites involve Gojo trolling Nanami, and Mechamaru, a character I wasn’t expecting to care about AT ALL. These remind me of the “commercial break shorts” of Haikyuu S1-3, which I also adore, one of those extra cherries on top of something already really good. Some may be annoyed that they subtract from the run time of the episode, but I’m of the mind that small things like these shorts add to the show in the long run. 
As far as complaints go, I don’t have many. The power system is very loose, by which I mean the author can sort of do whatever he wants with it any given moment. I prefer power systems to have set in stone rules. The overall story isn’t super compelling and the other villains aside from Sukuna aren’t very interesting, and I worry that once we know Sukuna’s end game goals, he won’t be interesting anymore either. Jujutsu Kaisen is not the greatest thing since sliced bread, but I had a LOT of fun watching it, and that’s kinda of what I’m here for.",8,Ex_Fenrir

                IAmAPest Reviews: Jujutsu Kaisen, animated by MAPPA Studios
Man, what was up with this first season of the year? We got so many bangers that it is legitimately hard to keep up with them. In these waters that are filled with great anime that is currently airing, it might be hard to keep your head above it. However, Jujutsu Kaisen proved to be a standout hit even with that considered. It even won Anime of the Year for 2020. Right off the bat, I am here to tell you that it deserves the praise that it gets, because this is a shounen that has done everything
                  right, so much so that it may lead the genre in a couple of years.
Story: 7/10   There isn't that much that is going on with the story at the time of writing. This is where I feel is the only big low point of Jujutsu Kaisen so far. The plot overall is pretty within the standards of a shounen, albeit with a couple of minor twists here and there. For example, without spoiling much, the main character, Itadori, isn't working towards a goal of being ""the best/strongest  _______"". Instead, he's achieving a goal that no one besides him can achieve, and it is heightened by the fact that he knows that once he achieves it, he'll get killed. It's pretty refreshing and helps make the story feel different from older shounens. Something I also enjoyed about the story Is the foreshadowing, because the story isn't too dark right now, but you KNOW that things will get grimy later on into the story. Granted, I'm an anime only, so I have no idea what happens in the manga, but I can see this story growing a lot more as it progresses, as it does start to pick up pace in the latter arcs of this first season.
Art 10/10   Simply put, this has turned into MAPPA's love child. They've shown us what they're capable of in terms of animation before, but it's just on an entirely different level here. Every frame of this anime could be a wallpaper for your laptop. Since this is a shounen, the most important aspect of Jujutsu Kaisen is the fight scenes, and, holy hell, they're damn good. Some scenes reach UFOtable-levels of crispness and vibrancy, creating fights that are just an absolute honor to watch. Also, every time that Satoru Gojo, Itadori's mentor, is on-screen, MAPPA just cranks it to 11. You'll know what I mean when you watch the anime. Overall, though, this is top-tier animation that is on the level of Demon Slayer, in terms of shounens.
Sound 9/10   The soundtrack of Jujutsu Kaisen compliments the art of it very well, as it adds to the personality of the show, in general. There are a lot of memorable tracks, like the first opening, which is something I still listen to regularly. It's just such a banger. Despite that one being my favorite, though, all of the openings and endings are creative as hell and memorable, in some way. It just adds to the overall jazzy feel that the show sometimes conveys. 
Character 10/10  I'm just going to get straight to the point here: every single character in this show is enjoyable. They're also rememberable, too, because all of them are connected to each other somehow, besides a couple of very minor villains. Itadori, as a character, seems like a generic shounen MC, at first, but his views on death and shaky ideals turn that notion on its head. Without spoiling, there's a moment that happens where Itadori almost immediately abandons the ideals he described only a couple of episodes before. It makes him out to be a hypocrite, of sorts, or just a person that doesn't fully believe in what he's telling himself. It's very interesting to see, and I hope that gets more development when the show picks back up. The supporting cast is extremely well-done, as they're all very likable, even if they don't seem to be, at first glance. The main trio, Megumi, Itadori, and Nobara, have really excellent dynamics, and something I enjoy A LOT is that there is no forced romance between the three. They're all just really good friends. For me, a show can be weighed down a lot by forced romances, so I'm glad there isn't any so far in Jujutsu Kaisen. Besides those three, Gojo is quite obviously a highlight, since everything he does is so cool, to the point where he gives off a god complex. That don't matter, though, because that man can crush my heart anyday. I could go on and on about the other characters, like the second-year jujutsu sorcerers and the other faculty at Jujutsu High, but it would boil down to me just praising the hell out of this show, even though I already am. One last point I'd like to make, however, is that all of the female characters in this show are badass and useful, in their own right. Jujutsu Kaisen doesn't follow the very off-putting shounen trope, which pretty makes it to where female characters are either reduced to damsels in distress or just static characters with no importance and development. I appreciate this so much, because it's irritating to me when that happens. Nobara, in particular, has some very badass moments that make her just as significant as Itadori and Megumi. Okay, I'll stop gushing about the characters now. TL;DR: this is the best cast of characters I've seen in a shounen in a long time.
Enjoyment 10/10: I wanted more and more and more of this show every single time I watched it on Friday. If it isn't anything, it's definitely entertaining, like shounens are supposed to be. Even though we got a very strong season with 24 episodes, I still wanted like 100 episodes already. This show will keep you invested during its entire run time.
Overall 9/10: I had to resist a lot to not give this a 10/10. If you look at my anime list, you'd see that I'm very lenient when it comes to ratings, but I'm going to wait until the second season of Jujutsu Kaisen to decide whether or not to make this a 10/10. Regardless, if you're a shounen fan, I HIGHLY recommend watching this show. Even if you're not one, you still need to watch it, because I feel like Jujutsu Kaisen will be at the top of discussion in the anime community for many years to come.",9,IAmAPest

                Hi , this is my Honest review of JJK.
So this is my first review on this site and I'll try to be unbiased, so I was worn out of anime for about a few years but JJK renewed my childhood love of anime .
This series is a Shonen Masterpiece , it takes cliche tropes and does it better .
You can clearly see the inspiration from Bleach and HxH , but JJK does its own things, every characters feel human with flaws and qualities, even the female characters are top class they feel like real girls with goals and ambitions.
The action scenes are spectacular , the
                  music fit the tone of the series perfectly.
JJK is one of those modern mature shonen like Chainsaw man and Hell's Paradise .
It speaks about themes like what's living a good life , moving forward from the past .
In conclusion I think JJK is a great series that can appeal to a lot of people from any age and that if u think about it u should at least watch episode 1  and see if u like it.",10,Marlyy

                Let me start off by saying, JuJutsu Kaisen isn't doing anything ground breaking or extremely different in the shonen genre,its not the most fleshed out or explained world, but man is it fun. If I had to choose one word to describe JuJutsu Kaisen, its fun. Fun characters, fun music, fun powers. Its not your super stereotypical shonen (though its definitely shonen) and I enjoy it A LOT. Its no masterpiece but so far I'm loving this series. Not to mention it has arguably the best opening AND ending of this anime season. I find nearly ever character to be likeable including the protagonist Itadori
                  (a lot of shonen protagonists can be a copy and paste so pure it's annoying type character) and the powers are interesting and exciting. I would definitely recommend this series. Though it could have been done better, I really enjoy the main premise of the show as well, Itadori forced into being the vessel for Sukuna and having to track down and eat each of his fingers is extremely creative.",8,Luv__Scarred

                Honestly, I've honestly gotten a little tired of Shounen lately. The flashy battles, formulaic storytelling, and one note characters get very tired very quickly. As such I was very skeptical about Jujutsu Kaisen at first, but after much wheedling from my friend, I finally gave in and watched it. I have to say, I'm very grateful I did. Although I can't say I've never seen JJK's characters before, or that it's plot is totally revolutionary, it is just different enough to feel fresh and exciting. The voice acting is spot on, and the art is really, really incredible. It's not quite as shockingly amazing as
                  something like Demon Slayer, but JJK's artwork always looks aesthetically pleasing and is often downright beautiful. 
JJK has a very solid cast of characters. They're simple, sure, but they're all a pleasure to have onscreen. I would be excited to see an episode focused on any one of them, because they're all interesting enough to carry their own story. The main trio, Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara, have good chemistry and I love every scene that they're in together. On the topic of characters, this show has some absolutely phenomenal women. Shounen is notorious for all of it's annoying, useless main girls, and I am happy to say that Nobara crushes this stereotype and then some. I know, I know, people say that about the female lead every time one of these shows comes out. But this time it's true. I promise. 
JJK's story beats are very similar to many anime of its kind: go on quest for monster, fight monster, tap into the power of friendship, defeat monster. If you wanted to be super critical of the show's writing, then yes, this is a con. The story structure is basic. Even though I was aware of this while watching, it never really hindered my enjoyment. Good characters can carry a bad plot, and JJK's plot is by no means bad. On the contrary, it's a total joy that leaves you constantly excited to see what's coming next. When the emotional beats hit, they hit hard. In summary, the plot is very solid, just not totally unique. 
Overall, this is a very good show. Entertaining from top to bottom, it boasts lovable characters, an enjoyable plot, and pretty girls (very important). If I were to sum it up, that's probably the word I would use: entertaining. It's not a masterpiece and doesn't dig terribly deep, but it is fun and flashy and everything it promises to be. So thanks to my friend that annoyed me into watching Jujutsu Kaisen, because it definitely brought my interest in Shounen back to life.",9,rabbitbear89

This is one of the best animes that I have watched in a long time, this anime came in and got massive hype so I decided to watch it, and believe me I did not regret it at all, if anything I'm extremely happy that I decided to start watching this anime.
Jujutsu Kaisen reminds me a lot of demon slayer, it came into the anime world with massive hype and fortunately, it was well deserved the hype, the animations were beyond excellent, after all, Mappa is the studio that animated this series.
The characters in this anime were very interesting, unlike other big animes this
                  one does not have useless female characters where they just run around the main character hoping to get in a romantic relationship with him.
The story is well written, it can definitely attract many watchers into it, now I'm not going to say any spoilers so I can't really talk about the story side of the anime, but I can say that I can give it an 8.5/10.
If you are looking to start watching the anime and not sure about it then let me tell you this, the anime is only 24 episodes, it is not that long, and it has earned every right for the hype that it got.",9,Ataba
40748,"
This will probably be a different review respect to the others. I watched this anime a couple of months ago and I was expecting more since everyone had praised it so much. 
A friend of mine had told me many things about Jujutsu Kaisen and she had explained to me the plot and everything ironically by making fun of it a lot since she did not like it much. On that occasion, I was curious to understand who was right: her, or those who thought it was a masterpiece. Well, now I can say without a doubt that, the one who was right, was my
                  friend. 
Let’s start talking about the reasons why I’m saying this: 
Story: 6/10
The plot is very banal and there’s nothing I haven’t seen over and over again before. About this, all the epic speeches that the characters make gave me the annoying impression of being copied and pasted by a thousand other shounen anime. Again, nothing new.
Another problem is that time passes very quickly; this leads to not understand how many days, weeks, or months pass between episodes. Moreover, I did not find it easy to understand what was happening in the series for two main reasons: firstly, several things are not fully explained and must be accepted for what they are without asking further questions. Secondly, there are often very long explanations that last for whole minutes and they only confuse ideas even more. Of course, the fact that the banality of the plot was boring me to death didn’t help.  
In Jujutsu Kaisen happen so many things, but at the same time, it looks like nothing happens. I mean, nothing useful. 
To conclude I would like to talk about two minor “problems” I found: the first one is that the exchange event between the Tokyo and Kyoto jujutsu schools is completely useless. It is needed only because students are going to have to repel an invasion of the school. The second thing is the size of the school. There are very few people, but the school is enormous. Why?? 
Art, animation, graphic: 9/10
Animation is beautiful and exceptionally well made, as expected from MAPPA studios. The choreography of the fights is just perfect, and the graphics are amazing. I think this is the main reason why this anime had so much success and was so much appreciated since the rest is nothing more than discreet.  
Sound: 7.5/10
I loved the openings (the first one in particular); even now that I finished watching this anime, I enjoy listening to them sometimes. The endings are okay and so it is the OST. 7.5/10 deserved. 
Characters, final score: 6/10
Main characters:
The main trio is composed of Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura. Ehm, I mean: Yuji, Megumi and Nobara.  
•	Yuji is the protagonist of Jujutsu Kaisen. He is randomly overpowered (when he was still a human, he was able to do impossible things (and this is explained by saying that “he is good at sports”), is energetic and dumb. When his grandfather passes away, he gets over his death after something like five minutes; I’m not joking or exaggerating, trust me. Moreover, when Yuji eats Sakuna’s first finger as if it is a normal thing, without hesitation and without being too much disgusted, he becomes even more powerful. - (3.5/10) 
•	Megumi is the classical cool and stoic guy, but he is kind and he wishes to protect everyone. He doesn’t like to talk about himself and his past, and his backstory is not bad. I liked him and I think he is the most interesting character in the trio. – (7/10)
•	Nobara is a proud and arrogant girl and she uses a hammer to fight. At first, when I heard about this character and her weapon, I thought it was a big, powerful, and magic hammer (Thor style). Well, it is not. 
Anyway, her backstory is so banal that I haven’t been able to empathize with her at all. I think this is one of the biggest problems of this character. – (4/10)
•	Gojo is one of the most appreciated characters of Jujutsu Kaisen and I understand why, but I don’t completely agree in saying that he is the best. He is cool and I found him funny more than once, but he is also overpowered and sometimes a bit annoying. I don’t think he is as special as other people think. Despite this, I liked him more than the other characters of the series. – (7/10)  
Side characters: 
The other students at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School probably are more interesting than the main characters. Their backstories are good, and even if they haven’t got incredible and original personalities, I liked them. One of my favorites is Inumaki Toge because I think he is the most peculiar one. – (7/10) 
Most useless characters:
-The protagonist’s grandfather is nothing more than a plot pretext. He dies with a magnificent and epic speech: “you are strong, you have to help others, it does not matter if you’ll lose your path because the most important thing is saving just one more person, die surrounded by many people…”. This is what Yuji will repeat to himself over and over again to gain braveness and strength. Personally, during that speech, all I thought about was: “why the heck is this person telling these things to his grandson? He knows that he is going to face curses and villains in his future? Why is he randomly telling him to save a lot of people?”. 
-Iguchi and Sasaki are two other plot pretexts. They appear in the first few episodes, and we’ll never see them again. 
I won’t give a score to these characters since they don’t do anything important or useful.  
Enjoyment: 7/10 
In the end, even if the banality of speeches and plot was annoying, I enjoyed watching it while making fun of no-sense events and laughing at characters with my friends. 
Besides the jokes, it’s not too bad if you look at it with the simple intent of spending time and having a laugh. If you do not take it too seriously, it is an enjoyable anime.

Now I'm also someone that prioritises enjoyment above all else. I'm willing to forgive a good bit if I connect with characters and that connects exists here, in this show for me. I'm not saying there's a lot to forgive .. I'm only saying I'd be willing to.
The characters and the action are the DEFINITE SELLING POINT of this show. This show also does follow some shounen tropes but I dont see
                  that as a negative because of how well Jujutsu kaisen manages to execute them. 
This is show is great and really good for me and if you like the shounen genre I'd definitely recommend that you check it out !",9,WeebKid447

                I have been waiting for this anime to release and I would say that it hit every expectations I had for it. 
Story: 7/10
It follows a pretty generic plot where our protagonist is forced into a whole different realm because of certain events that led up to it. However, I did enjoy the fact that it was an active participation on the part of the protagonist and it was his direct actions and intentions that led him to his current situation rather than an influence that was imposed on him (Yuji eating the finger was part of his intention to save his friends). Apart from
                  that, we follow his journey similar to other shonen series. However, it would be interesting to see the character dynamics between Yuji and Sukuna (and Megumi) and see how it plays out though I have my own predictions ;)
Characters: 8 or 9/ 10
I do enjoy the characters very much. While again it is a generic trio type of situation, they are memorable characters that leave viewers wanting more. It does reminiscence the whole situation in Naruto where Kakashi is somewhat a fan favorite (and my personal favorite) where in this case, we see Gojo taking that role. Nonetheless, I personally do see it as a plus
Overall: 8/10
At the moment where the anime is at and where I am personally at with the manga, I give it an 8, a pretty interesting character with somewhat a generic plotline. With that being said, it does not mean it's a bad anime or lame. I do believe it is a plus and there is no harm in trying it out even if you are not a big fan of shonen. I do see it being the next big thing considering the manga still has room to expand its plot and character development so time will tell if it ends up being better than an 8 or not.
Give it a shot and if you like it, cool. If not, oh well. 
Can't wait to see how the story continues!",8,BrokeBiish

                Disclaimer: I have not read any of the manga, so this is an anime-only review.
Every season there is that one shounen series that just completely dominates in popularity. Sometimes these titles live up to the hype, sometimes they don’t. However, It speaks volumes that jjk was airing during the same time as TPN 2 and AOT and still managed to not only compete, but also come out on top of viewership ratings. 
The good:
First, I’d like to start off by saying that production wise studio MAPPA blew my mind. 
The animation is gorgeous with well choreographed fight scenes that lean on realistic martial arts while
                  still maintaining some fantastical elements. The sound design as well, and don’t even get me started on the insane soundtrack. The ops are both amazing and I think we can all agree jjk deserves a prize simply based of that stylish first ending. (I have that song in my shower playlist and god is it a fucking bop.)
Despite following the shonen formula to a T, there’s something uniquely charming about jjk. You can tell that there was a lot of thought put into the magic system and rules of the sorcerer world. I also love that they depict the fights as bloody and tragic at times. I genuinely felt disgusted by some of the demons and it feels like every battle carries a certain weight. 
The bad:
However, every show has its share of problems and jjk biggest one (and the reason as to why I’m giving it a 7) is its terrible tendency to switch up the mood way. too. quickly. 
They try to balance out sad scenes by adding comedic effects to it, but the jokes just end up feeling misplaced and the scenes less immersive. One second I’m on the verge of tears and the next completely out of it, because jjk decided that the best way to deal with drama is having the characters... not care about it?
Also, this might be an anime only Problem, but jjk strongly relies on the friendship of the core characters but then ends up not actually developing them. 
It’s so frustrating to see the characters talk about becoming friends and being told that they spend quite a bit of time together but it never getting shown on camera. How can I believe these people genuinely care about each other when we’re only told that but never get the build up?
I hope in the upcoming seasons they’ll further develop the friendship between the main three because I think jjk has great potential to be an amazing shonen title. It actually IS an amazing show already, still, these little things deeply bothered me and kept it from being an 8 or 9 on my list.
TLDR; Good shounen with cool fights, despite the underdeveloped friendships between characters and a bit of a rushed plot at times, a really emotionally hard hitting anime at its best.",7,Lettucelife

                Jujutsu Kaisen, or Sorcerer Fight, fully lives up to its name.
not only does it fully embody its title's straightforward nomenclature, it also fully embodies the nature of its anime subgenre: battle shonen.
it's a show that's brimming with energy. from its high octane animation quality to the one-two punch one liner comedy to its brisk nonstop pacing to the varied score with new tracks for every new fight, Jujutsu Kaisen is a pure delight to watch.
but it's clear to me that Jujutsu Kaisen is more than just a fast paced seasonal thrill ride. to me, Jujutsu Kaisen is a watershed moment for shonen, a pivotal show
                  that will forever shift not only the battle shonen subgenre but the anime medium from this point onwards.
airing directly after the close of a decade that had equal amounts of wild experimentation/the preservation of hand-drawn animation in more niche circles (Mob Psycho 100 and the works of Masaaki Yuasa come to mind) and lucrative derivative creative bankruptcy/the rising over reliance of shoddy CGI in the mainstream (name any of the dime a dozen isekai), Jujutsu Kaisen serves as a perfect middle ground, appealing to the largest audience possible whilst upholding a standard of quality that's heretofore unprecedented in a mainline battle shonen.
reminiscent to 2019's Demon Slayer (which was a watershed moment for the medium in of itself), Jujutsu Kaisen rises above every single one of its contemporaries as a showcase not for the best writing, the best original premise, nor even the best characters (which is not a slight against the characters at all; they're all wonderfully rounded-out, even the sentient Panda).
no, Jujutsu Kaisen serves almost purely as a showcase for the handdrawn animation that explodes across the screen, bringing in its viewers for more doses of animated phantasmagoria every week.
i found myself dumbfounded at the amount of hard work the animators over at MAPPA poured into this, with week after week of sakuga goodness flowing without any seeming end. even small character moments and simple conversations possess detail that most shonen don't even bother with; characters actually emote even in mundane scenes, their hair animated to react to walk cycles or gusts of wind.
but what elevates the animation as well as the show at large is how the writing, pacing, and plot all serve to highlight the animation and the battles themselves.
to understand what makes Jujutsu Kaiden's structure so special, we have to also understand that it's not original; this isn't the first anime to use this formula of prioritizing battles over everything.
the formula of a nonstop battle shonen is something that's been around for a while, most prominently featured in classic manga/anime like Yu Yu Hakusho and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Vento Aureo. 
it's a formula that forgoes the hallmarks of typical battle shonen that turn so many people off the subgenre as well as the medium at large; it's lean, cutting off any unnecessary ""filler"" episodes, excising any episode that is fully dedicated to exposition and/or character development.
instead, the formula these battle shonen utilize is one that purely revolves around the aspect of battle itself:
-""training"" arcs are relegated to a one or two episodes at most, with the breakthrough required from this narrative device achieved purely through fight scenes
-comedy isn't just relegated to a few side characters or an episode or two, it's organically weaved between battles and sometimes, within battles themselves
-battles/fights themselves don't just serve as climax to machinations of ongoing plotlines, but also as a form of therapy for our characters, doubly advancing the plot while also rounding out our characters' backstory and development
Demon Slayer is the most recent example of this formula, but even that show falls to some of the pitfalls of the genre, its pacing taking a break from the action for comedic bits, exposition, or world building.
what Jujutsu Kaisen does differently is that it fully commit to that formula to the fullest. 
it's no wonder that the show is so delightful in wearing its influence on its sleeve when everything it accomplishes is built off everything that came before. in acknowledging rubbing shoulders with battle shonen giants like Naruto and Bleach (which has a very profound influence on Jujutsu Kaisen in more ways than other predecessors, but that's another topic for another time), it also acknowledges how it makes up for their shortcomings, learning from their mistakes and advancing the medium-dominating genre of battle shonen as a whole.
at the end of the day, Jujutsu Kaisen may not be wholly original but it isn't trying to be. in perfecting what makes the battle shonen subgenre works so well, and fixing the shortcomings of its biggest influences, Jujutsu Kaisen becomes something wholly different altogether.
it's forward-thinking in every way possible, working in tandem with respect for the influences that came before as well as upholding and revitalizing the lifeblood of traditional handdrawn animation.
only time will tell if this show is truly a microcosm of what popular anime will look like in the future (the upcoming adaptation of Chainsaw Man on the horizon is a great sign).
regardless, it's very plain that Jujutsu Kaisen is an instant classic. here's to the future!",10,brandotendie

                I was so surprised by this anime considering it is basically an amalgamation of every Shounen anime ever. I really didn't think anything of substance would come out of Jujutsu Kaisen; I figured it'd be a quick, in-and-out anime that didn't develop its plot or its characters. And now I'm a huge fan.
One thing I want to pick out about Jujutsu Kaisen, in terms of its uniqueness, is its pacing. I've seen Shounen that are paced extremely well--like Gintama--and Shounen that kind of suck at it--like Kimetsu no Yaiba. For all intents and purposes, Jujutsu Kaisen should've felt just like watching Kimetsu no Yaiba did--speedy
                  plot developments with little weight behind them and characters that were only developed within the context of the battles. However, I think the lack of training sessions that most Shounen have, plus the minimized use of ability names (like ""Rasengan,"" for instance) really helped the anime seem like it was paced well while still moving the story along. I think that's because you didn't see these characters developing super slowly only to explode in power during a fight; that type of thing makes the plot seem irrelevant because jumps in development are used over proper, believable development--I'm looking at you, Boku no Hero.
Basically, I walked out of this anime being really satisfied with the various plot points that lent themselves to the main story without feeling like I jumped from point A to point D in an episode. Also, these characters also started off relatively strong, so they could just go into battle and develop realistically, like in Gintama, for example. I do also get the sense, though, that a lot of care has gone into the crafting of this plot because, while a lot of things happened, it feels like the major plot points are being revealed at the proper pace so the story doesn't go too fast. Plus, the few side missions we saw during the course of this season actually mattered to the main plotline instead of being true side pieces--again, Boku no Hero, I'm looking at you. I thought the composition of the story was really well done.
The characters and the premise are absolutely electric, which is another thing that differentiates Jujutsu Kaisen from other Shounen. Not that Naruto or Boku no Hero or Kimetsu no Yaiba don't have colorful characters, but Jujutsu Kaisen's characters jumped off the screen in a way I haven't experienced before. I can't explain why, but each character comes off as extremely strong and interesting, and there isn't really a weak point in the cast we've gotten to know so far.
All in all, I think this anime could surpass the hype of Kimetsu no Yaiba and Boku no Hero--two of its contemporaries at the moment--and be a really nicely crafted anime that raises the bar for the Shounen category. I hope to see all of the manga animated because it looks absolutely stunning--probably the best animation I've seen in an anime that's come out in the past few years--and the story deserves it. I'm excited to see more.",10,BabyGirl06301

                Finally met a masterpiece type anime after a long period of time. Special thanks to MAPPA studio for the outstanding work. Well done. It was not too dark, not too light either. It was perfectly balanced. The fighting scenes were brilliant as well. 
The story by far was very good. But it is only a fraction of the manga. For a mere fraction it was really great. 
The characters were vivid. Not like unrealistic. They were great. Some anime make characters too edgy to be realistic. Nonsense psychology, unrealistic madness just to make anime more intense. But this one provides us with realistic natural characters.
                  Not too flat not too unrealistic. A great work done developing those characters. 
The animation is just too much awesome, marvelous. It was outstanding. All scenes were great animated with great details. MAPPA has outdone itself this time. 
The sound was very good. The songs were very good. And the recording of sounds of different things were greatly noticeable if you wear a good earbud. The OP and ED were good. The voice actors were very good as well. 
Enjoyment 100%. It wasn't boring at all not even for a single moment. Filled with excitements. There are sadness, happiness, tragedy all sorts of emotions. 
It is really 10/10. Because they balanced everything so well in the show so that majority of the audience can enjoy it fully.",10,Alsayer
40748,"
                After watching all of Jujutsu Kaisen, I can say that I was pleasantly surprised by some of its elements, but I would not call it a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination--at least not yet. 
I feel like the problem with people's expectations with this series is that it would achieve the explosion of popularity and love a series like Demon Slayer did with just 24 episodes. Demon Slayer, however, is very much not the norm when it comes to how the first 20-ish episodes of a shounen series usually pan out, and I think part of that is that the series is shorter
                  than most long-running Shounen Jump titles. Usually, the first 20 or so episodes are by far the worst part of any long-running shounen series, including One Piece. I dropped One Piece after 20 episodes because I was bored to tears, with Gintama also only getting 20 episodes out of me before I dropped it. It was only after going back and giving them another shot, did these two series became some of my favorite anime of all time. 
My point is, long-running shounen are slow burners a lot of the time. Jujutsu Kaisen is still clearly trying to find its footing, giving us long scenes filled with info dumps, and philosophical exposition that feels rather heavy-handed. It's clumsy in some of its execution, but to make up for that there is a lot of heart. I've gotten attached to characters that were on screen for barely 5 minutes total, because the character writing is strong and the banter is witty. For the first time in a long while, I honestly could not tell you if the female lead is a romantic interest at all, and I appreciate that not once has any reference been made to how pretty she is or anything else physical. The animation is also stellar and I will be thanking Mappa for gifting us with Gojo Satoru's everything for a long time to come. 
So, should you give the series a chance? I would, and I will. Some of the more modern Shounen Jump titles have left me disappointed. Series like Demon Slayer, Black Clover, and Dr. Stone feel disingenuine, and I can't shake the feeling that something is missing. It's hurt my love for the shounen genre, and I wondered if I'd just grown out of it. Jujutsu Kaisen doesn't feel like its missing anything for me, and it has single-handedly renewed my faith in the genre. I want to give it a chance to become the series I know it has the potential to be, and as long as you can handle body horror, I think you should too. At the very least, I'm willing to bet it's first 24 episodes will be better than One Piece.",8,Harmonywind5

Story 8/10:
It's fairly predictable, but fairly unique in it's own way. The closest i can think of is proabably mob psycho, but even then it's definitely enjoyable and really well written. There are some things that could do with a lot more explanation, but other than that, it's fun to watch.
Art 10/10:
Mappa smashing it as always, the art is near perfect. showing humourous faces and changing to a chibi style at the right moments, even during mid fights.
But the fight scenes, WOW. Honestly it's insanely good the detail that are in them, the animation is so smooth and flows really
                  well.
Sound 10/10: 
Easily the best ED this season, and the op is up there as well. Not much to say, other than solid.
Character 10/10:
They're characters you fall in love with. I can already see cosplays coming out for Gojou. Minor characters and side characters such as nanami are also extremely cool. The balance between the characters is also very well done. Itadori may be the protagonist, but every character gets so much screentime and isn't ignored. I love it.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Fantastic, at first i was hesitant to watch it, but now every week i'm looking forward to it. I was genuinely surprised at how good it was, and especially how much it made me laugh.
Overall: 9/10
It's just the story that lets it down slightly, i can't pinpoint what exactly, but something is missing that stops it from being one of the greats in the genre, like boku no hero & mob psycho.But it is definitely up there!

                jujutsu kaisen. what a shounen. despite having occasional issues in terms of character motivations, comedy that misses and plot inconsistencies, its arguably the perfect shounen. everything that people look out for in a shounen, jujutsu kaisen does and goddamn does it do it well. 
action scenes look nothing short of spectacular. dynamic, colorful and oh so exciting, every fight scene has weight and never shortchanges the viewer in terms of showcasing just how crazy fights in the world of JJK are like.
the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. fitting the mood at all times and constantly elevating whats shown on screen, the music used never fails bring
                  the viewer further into the universe of jujutsu kaisen. be it an emotional piano for a touching scene, or an absolute banger of an electro/rock/hip-hop track for the show's iconic fights, the soundtrack essentially doesn't fail.
and now the characters. each and every character presents the viewer with some something cool and unique, main characters to side characters to villains alike. all characters get development that doesn't feel forced or stereotypical and instead relatable and organic. not to mention, their powers are pretty fucking badass. 
all in all, jujutsu kaisen is fantastic. sure, it may not be the best anime of all time and it doesn't propose the deepest philosophical questions or the most clever plot points, but at the end of the day, its a shounen. a show is not considered ""good"" when it absolutely excels in every possible metric you can judge it by. instead, a show is considered ""good"" when it achieves the exact intended outcome it set out to achieve, exactly the way they wanted it to achieve. i believe the writers of jujutsu kaisen wanted to create something action-packed, beautiful and above all, endlessly entertaining. they have most definitely achieved that.",9,blaringsonex

                In the first episode, this anime made me read the manga. I always read the manga alongside the anime story, comparing both types of media, when I like too much of the anime. The incredible part of this, is the fact that I did on the first episode. 
Jujutsu Kaisen is for me, one of the greatest shounens of this decade, alongside BNHA, proving that a good story with action, adventure and premise, is still something that captivate the attention of many, and MAPPA Studios did it well, proving that, you can be loyal to the original work, but knowing how to adapt to a
                  different type of media. Being honest, Jujutsu is perfect to me, and now, I feel comfortable to continue the story on manga (since I was reading along the tv show story), and this is only because everything was perfect for me.
The anime has a great and simple story for this season 1, convincing the audience of what they want and how this universe can grow, from both good or bad side. MAPPA was responsible to maintain the art at high level from the first to last episode, showing that the differences that we had from manga, is only relatable to the animation itself. Also, the sound design with the proper music at the right time, give to us a great example of what to do with great action scenes. For the last, all the characters are charismatic enough for you to like them and give proper reasons to the fanbase, reaching all types of taste, passing through good guys from bad guys, and even the secondary characters that appeared for a few episodes or scenes.

                Even though the themes are actually quite predictable, being the typical Shonen it is, I still find this entertaining. Some parts were a little different than the typical Shonen genre as I've noticed. So far, this is the first time where I actually kind of liked the protagonist more than the OG character like Gojo, which everyone is hyping on about. Itadori Yuuji is so passive but has hero-complex that I really don't mind 'cause for some reason, he was a likable character in my list. I mean I always have specific bias and admiration to some Shonen protagonist like Naruto or Luffy, but I
                  guess he has the potential (for me, that is) to top my list. I liked the part that his background was still a mystery and his relationship with Gojo-sensei is so fluffy and wholesome. Also, Sukuna. Yes, is it weird I always await for him to appear on every episode? Lmao.

I’ll keep it concise. In my opinion Jujutsu Kaisen deserves ALL the hype it is getting. Unlike a lot of new gen shonen, it analyzed and took into account its predecessors’ mistakes and changes that people desired.
It’s a well balanced show that is fitting for modern times and was not afraid to break a lot of shonen stereotypes/cliches. Something that most new gens (even the big ones) are still struggling with. This show was definitely a step in the right direction and I hope became a model example of positive change.

Jujutsu Kaisen had a lot of hype when it was introduced and I can see why as it was really amazing. This anime was great to watch from start to finish
Story 9/10- The story is about named a boy named Itadori who's eaten a cursed object which was part of one of the dangerous curses Sukuna which would have killed Itdori but he survived and has the curse within in him now but Jujutsu sorcerers who are people who kill curses wants Itadori dead because of it but Gojo one of the strongest sorcerers allows him to enroll into the academy where sorcerers learn how
                  to kill curses which we begin to see other characters like in his year like Megumi and Nobara. The story is very interesting as some people say it kinda like Naruto but still different in many which I like about it, it a good plot which interesting theme to it.
Art 9/10- The art was beautifully drawn out like how when they showed the aura or energy of their cursed energy as is dark blue with black around like flames and is amazing to see and character designed was great as each of them suited to there style and how they act so they were drawn good.
Sound 8/10- Opening and ending were ok, I liked the first opening from the rest, and the character voices for both sub and dub were great and most fights had good ost with them.
Character 9/10- I have to admit that Jujutsu Kaisen has different interesting characters and none of them were boring to me as each other were great character ideas as they would build that story in the anime even better or just make me smile or laugh like the main protagonist Itadori who I don't hate as he is a funny, kind guy and he just goes with the flow like when he ate the finger and Sukuna in within him know, he just calm or just doesn't that much as for him he wants to protect others from danger. Other characters like Megumi or Nobara who are in the first year with Itadori are also good characters in the anime.
Enjoyment 9/10- I love how this anime would make me laugh in most scenes or smile though out an episode since how good it was showing how funny this anime is but when it came to fight scenes those were amazing to watch like Aoi and Itadori team up with the curse with was pretty cool or how most epic moments are amazing in this anime like Gojo attacks are on whole another level as I was just amazing to see.

                Gojo is a blessing to this earth. Everything about this is amazing, and Jujutsu Kaisen deserves a perfect 10. I like how the animators put so much effort into drawing Gojo when he takes his mask off. That scene was twice as detailed as any other scene.
All of the characters are amazing, the main character could be better though. The other characters make up for it though.
The power system is very hard to understand, but once you do, it's really cool. It doesn't start making sense until halfway through the season, though.
I feel like Jujutsu Kaisen is going to have a good ending. What it
                  feels like it's setting up for is so unexpected for a Shonen, and I really don't know what to expect. 
I do have to say, Jujutsu Kaisen has a lot of violence, so if you can't handle blood and gore, don't watch it.",10,SatoruGojostan

                - It´s a very pretty-looking anime
- the 2nd ending song (and especially the video) made me cry so god damn much
- the fighting scenes are amazing no doubt bout that
- i hated every single of the Kyoto students and every single episode / scene that was about them. It just felt like filler episodes to me.
- Nanami is god-tier, i mean, have you seen this man?? 10/10 for Nanami
- The ""evil"" dudes were boring, their plan was bland and uninteresting and they didn´t have that much of a personality and most of the time they didn´t do shit,  especially geto, he was just watching
                  from the side of the road the whole time. I just wish there was more about geto to make him slightly more intersting ´cuz he has the potential right? He was just ... there.. and that´s it. Just to have a bad guy I guess
- dislike Mahito with my whole heart
- Nobara is the most useless character i´ve ever seen. She didn´t win a single time, went to the hospital after one fight, lost coincisness after another, got her clothing ripped by that kyoto girl and whatelse not.... EDIT: dammmnnn her last fight was amazing, probs to her. THAT was the best episode so far. Her being a bad bitch, thats cool
- I love that Nobara has a hammer. It´s really nice to see some other type of weapon rather than a sword / knife like in any other anime! Really appreciated that
- could not watch it in 1 go, it took me several days to finish this anime even tho I binge-watch everything usually, which is a minus point for me
- Toge needs more love from the fandom, he´s amazing
- love that there was no unnecessary fan service like panty shots and stuff like that. All these girls were wearing PANTS!
- the friendship between the tokyo students is super cute, i really really liked watching their interactions
- Gojo´s fights were the best. This man´s powers are out of this world, super cool
- I really liked that one of their enemies was using wood/flower/nature powers. Not many characters use this in animes, it´s always fire or smth, so seeing someone with nature powers was a very welcome change
- Megumi´s last fight was my favorite one out of the whole show
- I couldn´t stop laughing at the fact that they said almost everyone should be in rank 1... like...  u sure about that? Mei Mei in 1 ? HAhahahaaha no fucking way she´s a 1 phhhfff",7,NeBygKo

                Well that was quite a good enough shounen show to go along with the journey of Yuji and friends. Although I will say personally that it’s not the best nor the original show I would gloss over but it was pretty watchable. The only characters I found interesting of course on the show was Gojou sensei (yes I admit I simp him), Toudou, Maki, Mei ( I also simp her) and Sukuna because I just find the main characters are just your typical three musketeers that you normally see in other generic stories. I mean to be fair, I found Nobara and Yuuji to be
                  pretty boring and annoying. Megumi on the other hand, I will give a benefit of the doubt that he was alright but like I wanted more out of his stotic personality yknow.
Aside from my pickiness regarding the characters on the show, I friggin liked the music especially “lost in paradise” and “vivid vice” like omg man, I’m gonna be listening to those songs for good, they are just ultimate bangers!! As well the art is just amazing like well done to MAPPA with those great fighting scenes, it’s just too bad some of the character development and plot just seems a bit bland. I suppose that goes with saying that the series isn’t finished so that makes sense that it just seemed rushed to me!
Anyways again it’s a good enough show, I wouldn’t call it anime of the year like what Crunchyroll said but if you like the demon genre, check this series out!",7,Curiouswanderer
40748,"
                I feel like I should mention that the reason I decided to watch this show was first seeing a piece of fanart that referenced the first ED and then I saw the ED and loved it so much that I knew I had to give this show a try. And even with the fun, smooth energy of the ED, I wasn't drawn away at all when the show is more a traditional shonen anime. The animation and art style is gorgeous in my opinion, and makes everything from the incredible fights to dialogue scenes always have a nice visual appeal. Not like I know enough
                  to make a good claim here, but the lighting is definitely a strong suit. And I am getting a bit ahead of myself, but this show has some of my favorite characters I've seen in anime, among the many good ones that round out the main cast and side characters. Nobara Kugisaki is always very expressive and plays well off of Yuji, balancing her confidence and aggressiveness with a girly demeanor at times. Also her hammer and nails attack is always cool. And then there's Kento Nanami, the jaded salaryman who's a jujutsu sorcerer because he's good at it. His blunt monologue about what it means to be an adult is one of the funniest moments of quite a funny show. The comedy mainly involves either Gojo or Todo with Gojo's trolling and Todo's intense criteria for determining friendship. It's a good time.
And I was wondering where this show was going as it didn't have some strong arcs that take up most of the season as opposed to a show like My Hero Academia. which is fine, but I wasn't sure what it would build to by the end, a wonderful baseball episode notwithstanding. But I liked how the last three episodes really built up the power of the main three. It's not that they all get a power boost by the end, but a more definitive look at how well they are as sorcerers with a look towards the future. If you could call this a big introduction to the series, then there's a lot to look forward too.",10,thestarsailor

                i have no idea where to start with this. I fucking love demon slayer and that was my favourite battle shonen for quite a while. then i came across jujutsu kaisen (yes im very late to the anime band wagon). 
The only problems i have are the fact that each arc kind of just... ended. idk how to explain it but it seemed a bit rushed in that after an arc, there was a new one immediately. there was no break or anything like that. another problem i had was the fact that (in the anime so far at least) every character seemed a bit
                  too overpowered. there were next to no difficult fights or any hardships. it was just ""ooh new cursed spirit to fight"" *throw in a few attacks and explosions* ""ooh now they're dead"". repeat that through the whole season.
Now lets go over the good things. despite the characters being overpowered, the character design is fucking awesome. every character is completely different, with their own set of moves and their own quirks. its great. even their personalities were completely different. i couldnt find a character i didnt like. even some of the cursed spirits were cool characters for christs sake!
THE MUSIC... you can tell if a soundtrack is good if u actually notice the music in an anime. i think jujutsu kaisen's soundtrack has got to be one of the best soundtracks in all of anime (that i've seen so far).
The art was beautiful. idk how to explain it but the art style just has a modern ""tinge"" to it which just makes it look really clean. the animation is also awesome. especially when someone is using cursed energy. that shit flows smoother than my speech with girls.
this anime had me on the edge of my seat so many times due to how exhilarating the fight scenes were. the combination of music, sound design, animation and the characters' awesome moveset made them some of the best fight scenes i've ever seen in anime.
all i can say is for me, this anime was bloody amazing and i'd recommend it to anyone.",9,FinnyBoi789
40748,"
                The production quality of Jujutsu Kaisen stands out immediately. Say what you will about Studio Mappa, but the animation of this show is fantastic. Fight scenes have a lot of motion, without sacrificing the quality of the stills. Occasionally, you might see some shortcuts taken in the less important scenes, but this is a fine sacrifice to take if it means making the fight scenes more impressive.
I think the story is good too. The entire story centers around Yuuji. While he has his own internal struggle against Sukuna, many other things are focused on him since he's possibly the only person capable of being Sukuna's
                  vessel. The higher ups of Jujutsu Academy wanting Yuuji dead since they don't want to take any risks, Gojou wanting to raise a powerful group of students to overthrow the old leaders, and the curses wanting to get Sukuna on their side. This creates a lot of conflict within the organizations surrounding Yuuji.
Most of the characters are very good too. The main 3 first-years all have well-defined motivations. Gojou is my favorite character, since I think his plan to overthrow the established leaders by raising a new group of powerful sorcerers is admirable. Toudou is another highlight. He's so strong that nobody can boss him around, so he just does whatever he wants. Toudou's chemistry with Yuuji in the fight against Hanami was a joy to watch. Nobara's ability is my favorite out of all of them. She was really cool in the fight against the half-curse brothers when she stabbed herself with her nails. I thought all the curses were cool, too. I feel like the curses themselves don't need any greater motivation given how they are created, but they did have an overall goal anyways.
However, some of the characters left a lot to be desired. Panda was the most mediocre to me. It's kind of interesting that he is the school president's greatest creation, but Panda himself didn't really have much in terms of motivation. Mechamaru is similarly mundane. Mai came off as a really pitiful character. She only became a sorcerer because her sister did, but would have preferred to have stayed as a servant to her family. This made the witch girl's admiration of her really annoying to me.
Overall, though, this was a very enjoyable show. I definitely recommend it.",9,DeathlyPi9

                Is jujutsu kaisen the best anime of the year? well idk, it's too early to say that, but with the episodes that I've seen so far, it does have the potential to be the best anime of the year. (not including sequels).

                I am not usually someone that write reviews but when an anime deserves it I do it. JJK honestly was one of those anime that make me want friday to come sooner, every week I was impatiently waiting for friday to come and watch the anime with my brother, anyhow  in terms of
story
9.5/10 while the story is like most anime it is still different in its own way,as you continue to watch more episodes you will see why jjk is different from the rest. I could continue and continue but will not spoil anything so you can go with an open mind once you
                  watch it. 
Art
I give a 10/10, Mappa really did flex its muscles with this one. every scene was insane, I love the visuals and the fights look so real, honestly it was delightful to watch. I need to add that episode after episode the art and visuals were consistent, there was not a single episode which the arts were not on top tier. 
Sound 
I give it a 9.5/10. The openings and endings were top tier no doubt, especially the first ones, but in terms of soundtracks at least on my taste some of them did not make me feel like soundtracks  from dbz or other anime, not saying they are bad just not my taste. Some of them are pretty good like the one of Todou.
Characters
10/10 At least imo this is what gives jjk a strong lead. The characters are so interesting and not just the main ones but also the supporting cast. The trio are so different but likeable in its own way. Each of them have an interesting background and the three of them are strong, not a single one of them is weak, men and women are treat the same in terms of power I may say as we saw Megumi´s and Nobara´s power in the last two episodes.
enjoyment 
10/10. This was a really beautiful anime to watch, I love everything with it as it make my have different emotions while watching it from  goofy to sad, to anger and happiness. I assure you will not be disappoint with this anime.",10,allancalderini12
40748,"
                Jujutsu Kaisen is an anime I came into on the back of it being hyped a lot, so I was deliberately tempering my expectations. And on balance I was right to, it's a good anime but for me not a classic.
Let's start with the good points. It has good action scene (mostly - sometimes the movement of characters seems a bit implausible but still they're exciting), the soundtrack is decent, some of the lines are deep and the villains motivation makes some sense. In fact for me the villains are one of the stronger elements in the series having some variety and interesting personalities. 
For
                  me though what weakened this series is the world building and story progression. 
For a true classic you need to feel immersed in the world (HunterxHunter is a good example of doing this well). It needs to feel authentic and have a realistic base.  
Jujutsu Kaisen fails to do this, especially in the opening 7/8 episodes. There's an uncomfortable relationship between it painting a desperate situation with a desperate lack of people to dispense curses and a lack of urgency/seriousness from many characters. A lot of time I found myself feeling like the blase atmosphere (often done for humor which could be pretty hit/miss) felt really off with the dark and serious picture they were trying to paint. 
By way of another example, was I the only one who felt placing a tournament arc in this series strange? Although it plays a role in the main story, again the infighting between the two relatively small seeming jujutsu clans and the fact they have time to beat the crap out of each other despite being short on jujutsu users felt odd. A lot isn't explained about the world either leaving a rather piecemeal impression. 
The main characters, although somewhat generic, are decently done. But being unable to fully immerse oneself in the setting detracts a lot from caring about them. Bottom line, this anime has impressive moments, and is a decent watch, but don't go into it believing it's the next classic.",8,DJSharp
40748,"
                What a wonderful show, I really love when surprises like this show up.
This anime goes on with such an awesome pace, not too fast nor too slow and there's everything one could possibly ask for in an anime. Character development with superb personalities, great story and plot, amazingly incredible soundtrack and animation and all of this combined with this whole cool universe is the formula for success in my opinion.
Team Yuuji is great to watch as well as Gojou sensei. I just think they should explore more the families of jujutsu sorcerers and the systems involved in selection/progressing. Special mention to Kugisaki as she is
                  an incredibly badass character and extremely fun to watch.
The story is really amazing and I'll definitely watch it all over again in the near future. It progresses in a really satisfying manner and never lets the viewer bored.
Animation and character design are also amazing. Fight scenes look extremely good. The opening/ending themes are really good as well. I've enjoyed most aspects of this series and I think the only thing preventing one to like this masterpiece is the genre. Maybe some get too annoyed by shōnen, but this is one of the best I've watched.",10,hakuryuu-
40748,"
                Epic in every way.
After the first few episodes my impression was ""Ok, this is different; seems like it'll be entertaining.""  But towards the end of Season 1, moments of ""Whoa, cool!"" started piling up.  And by about 2 episodes into Season 2 it was more like ""Holy SH!T this is good.""
Every aspect of this show screams quality.  The story has a perfectly balanced progression: every few episodes move us to the next, more intense act.  The conflict is suitably complex: both the good guys and the bad have diverse personas and alignments.  The animation is great.  The music is
                  next-generation, using multiple different genres that sound like real music lovers were involved, and a couple tracks trippy enough to even listen to on their own.  The characters are real, i.e. the unpleasant female lead really IS unpleasant (yet relatable), and characters' idiosyncrasies really are idiosyncratic (but believable).  Even the intro and end credits are well done.  The fight scenes are some of the most awesome ever.  The dialogue has some snippets of legitimately provocative ideas.  There are thematic nods to multiple different inspirations.  I think it would be impossible to not be impressed with the work that went into this.
Finally, re the mind-blowing Season 2: it's a sprawling, lightning-fast battle, like a more ecstatic blend of Basilisk and the Attack on Titan forest fights.  IMO it's up there with the greatest battles in anime.",10,korzzz
40748,"
                Genuinely just a fun show to watch. I find myself to be a serious person and disconnected when watching TV shows, but watching this show I often find myself holding back a large grin or a wave of tears. It's seriously an amazing show and a great watch if you have the time. You'll be surprised how much you like it.
Another thing: as a girl who watches anime, I was pleasantly surprised by the women in the show. None of them are reduced to lazy stereotypes, and none are shoved into tight clothes and sexual situations for fanservice. They have complex backstories just like their
                  male friends, and none of them are even forced into romances! That's one of my biggest pet peeves when watching shounen animes. However, as a bisexual enjoyer of some good waifus here and there, the girls are still so easy to fall in love with.
Overall, 9/10 in most aspects. Art is a 10/10, because I just love the art style so much, and enjoyment is 10/10 because there's no better show to embroider to.",9,jonatganofficial

STORY (9/10) : 
The concept of demons is quite generic, but the fact that it revolves around a certain individual even in that vast faction is what makes it unique. Having watched numerous Anime based on demons, the story still is hard to anticipate which is a plus point. In this case, the story revolves primarily around the demon named RYOUMEN SUKUNA. The main protagonist is ITADORI YUUJI. It's not something more exceptional, but the adaptation is done really well. 
ART (10/10) : 
Action scenes were great, & I want nothing more than that. They didn't hold
                  back in animation. 
SOUND (9/10) : 
I liked the OP & ED songs, especially ED which I didn't miss to watch every week. 
CHARACTERS (10/10) : 
My most favorite character in this show is ITADORI YUUJI for his personality. He is capable of saving others given the strength he has, is simple and honest, and doesn't blame others if something were to go wrong ; In this aspect I find him closer to my ideal protagonist. 
I am only interested in the personality of the main protagonist. If he's the best, I would readily give 10 ratings to the anime as a whole. That being said, I enjoyed the 'side characters' as well. I especially liked the character AOI TOUDOU for being a friend of YUUJI ; the conversations they had ""Which woman is your type?"" were most enjoyable.  haha~ 
ENJOYMENT (9/10) : 
I had a great time watching this show. I enjoyed especially the moments of ITADORI YUUJI & TOUDOU AOI. Their friendship is the highlight of this show (in my eyes). Plus, there's more... 
OVERALL (10/10) : 
I am giving it 10 (instead of 9) because of the protagonist ITADORI YUUJI. That doesn't mean that this show lacks in other aspects ; It's just that his character matters much more to me. 
I appreciate the dedicated work of everyone involved in making this show. 
Thank You!",10,Doutei-kun

                Jujutsu Kaisen does deserve the attention and acclaim its getting. That's as much as I can say for the beginning of this review. I think that it definitely is stellar in some parts that really sells to a lot of audiences and i can see the hype well and fully.
first of all, music is so important to me and this was just great. the openings and endings were great, the eery music in some darker scenes contrasting to the rock music in fighting scenes. it was all really spectacular and added a lot of depth to what we were watching.
next, the hand to hand combat
                  and fighting choreographies were so spot on, beautiful and satisfying to watch. it makes for a fun viewing that is really enjoyable. I think that it pays attention to small details in the way that it can be extra dark and then very happy and funny and its so obvious that the creators love the characters so much. a lot of characters are incredibly well written and flashbacks to the past didn't feel forced... especially for the Kyoto kids imo.
It's a fun world and fun concept and it feels very modern in the way the jokes are and i see why its so appealing to a lot of new anime watchers. definitely a good starting shonen and a good demon anime overall.
but then there are the things that i didn't favor and let me just say ... theres quite a bit of it. first of all, itadori as a character baffles me. his motivations and his reasons to live or to die are questionable at its finest. perhaps he's kind of inhuman in that sense bc i don't see any realness in his character like i seriously see an empty shell that cracks jokes from time to time. i don't see the motivations in him the way other MCs do and that is a glaring ! issue !
more on that, this first season is not divided up nicely. like the story is messy and inconsistent. i swear like it just feels very disjointed and just not great and doesn't work towards a clear goal which is quite confusing to me. i mean the ending arc really just shows this problem as it is arguably the weakest and most random arc with new characters we don't care about. we could have gotten more of mahito and geto or something but we didn't and it just left the season with a really bland note.
also,, i want training scenes! i know gojo is not the typical teacher and doesn't really train his students in conventional methods or something but I want to see itadori struggle, i want to see him fail in front of his master, i want to see his progress and his failures, i want to see Something but we didn't get anything ! the only real training scene was the scenes with todo and that was so late in the game that it felt odd to have it then. I don't know but i'm old fashioned okay, i want to watch some training scenes ! and better explanations for powers and techniques please.
*SPOILERS GOING FORWARD*
the last thing that really bothered me has to be the yoshino + nanami arc because Hey what the fuck was that. i loved the yoshino arc so much, i think how they wrote this morally grey character was so perfect. i loved the way they built his really dark 90s anime style world and characters, i loved how his character is so innocent and confused and sad and human... I just loved yoshino so much. and then to kill him in such a way that disrespected his character and then turning his story into an anti-bullying campaign. WOW.
that was the moment i felt like i had it. i was done.
why would you create a character that had so much potential to become an antagonist or a supporting character, only to kill him when he had the form of a dinosaur and then reduce his story to something that didn't even impact the story as a whole. if we didn't get this yoshino + nanami arc then nothing would have changed anyway so WHY.
i mention nanami bc he has to be one of my favorite characters in the anime but then if he wasn't in this, not much wouldve changed and that's bad writing to me ! i swear like jjk is so good like its good but it suffers from these basic problems like story writing and inconsistencies that kill its potential.
anyway that's all, to summarize,, well its good and fun but didn't quite meet the expectations i have in mind when watching anime.",7,amandont

                Story: 6/10 
This is honestly the only area where I felt Jujutsu Kaisen had serious room for improvement. The first arc captivated many of us, including myself. However, once we got to Junpei's arc the story got very choppy. It seemed very rushed, and I personally found him underdeveloped for me to really care about what happens. Following this, there was a tournament arc in order to introduce new characters. The backstories of each character is good, but when it came to the battles there was no weight to who won the battles. You don't have to win to get promoted at the end of
                  the day. But once we got back into the bread and butter, the big three squad, Jujutsu Kaisen was able to shine again. Each arc had good points, but it was not cohesive in the slightest. 
Art: 10/10 
It's pretty evident that the animation budget and animators were top tier throughout this entire series. While other series like Dororo (another MAPPA project) had a couple episodes with very cheap production, MAPPA did not take their foot off the gas. The last episode specifically left me with my jaw dropped. I hope we see the same incredible mix of CGI and hand-drawn animation in future installments. 
Sound: 10/10 
My motto on sound is that if you're paying a lot of attention to it, then the anime is probably lacking in some other department. The OPs and EDs are great, and I didn't feel anything was out of place when it came to music during the fights. So good stuff!
Characters: 10/10 
This is where Jujutsu Kaisen shines. While Junpei was underdeveloped, the rest of the cast were all incredible. Having this standard team of three with two guys (or one guy and a panda) along with one girl allows the potential of a love triangle to be lazily written in. But it's thankfully not done here. Kugisaki still displays her femininity and strength while Itadori and Fushiguro make an insanely entertaining trio. Kugisaki is not Sakura, and she really challenges Itadori's viewpoints on this new world he just entered. I love how unique the characters look, their personalities, and the wonderful interactions between one another. Big props to the author. 
Enjoyment: 8/10
Jujustsu Kaisen started strong and finished strong. I lost some interest in the middle, which is a problem in several 24-episode anime. But when it was strong, it captivated me. It was standing on the top of the anime hill and I was merely a witness. 
Overall: 8/10
Jujutsu Kaisen is a great show, but far from a masterpiece. I look forward to the rest of the manga to get adapted. This won't be a decade-long type of anime like Naruto, but it has earned its place near the top to shine for a couple years.",8,Jaws491
40748,"
                A straight up to the business anime, with no shounen bs and some clever ways to deal with stereotypes. 
 This is not a revolutionary anime, the animation is very good, the soundtrack has some good moments, the characters are interesting. But what makes everything more tasteful, is how the narrative is so down to Earth and very satisfying. 
Don't you hate when a MC start to be friend with a villain because he thinks they're equal everytime? 
Well that's not jujutsu, if you're a villain in jujutsu you'll get JUMPED. 
The villains in this anime literally get ERASED by the good guys in this
                  anime.
And it's so satisfying, it's soo very well animated, and simple that you'll think, why don't this happens in every anime? 
Of course, all this direct to the point thing has downsides, like the MC that is very low key in the show, or the antagonits that lacks originality and a more interest personality, but the presence of Gojou sensei and Sukuna (the most powerfoul beings in this anime) sometimes give a good twist in the plot.

                I've slept on Jujutsu Kaisen for five episodes, but when I heard how good it was, I gave it a try, and boy, I'm glad that I made that choice. The story was starting to spice up with each episode. The dark theme for the series itself is intriguing and a good combination for the bits of comedy it has from time to time. 
The characters themselves were delightful. The diversity between them is fascinating, not to mention that the female characters are very badass, instead of making them the cliche damsel-in-distress act.
The power system of Cursed energy is very balanced, from the various types
                  of methods the characters use that energy while making sure that the protagonist isn't too overpowered, making him grow along with the others.
The music brought along the hype since the first opening. As much as I like the first ending, its usage in some of the darker episodes felt off, but it was still catchy, but I still liked it. R.I.P Lost in Paradise on Spotify.
Overall, Jujutsu Kaisen has the potential IMO to be one of the new big three, along with the top-tier animation from MAPPA, I enjoyed it, and once again, I'm glad that I got to watch it.

                Jujutsu Kaisen is that kind of anime that didn´t live up to the high expactations I had, before watching it I expected a solid storyline, good characters and epic fights (basically everything a good shounen does)... Instead, I´ve received an extremely fast paced story with a bad introduction of the same and with a weak use of it´s characters in general. Besides characters like Gojo and Megumi, I don´t have a good look towards the majority of the cast, each character had their moments but their writing always seemed pour and randomly planned, Maki was an interesting character when it came to backstory wise, but
                  the leck of focus on her character, made me not appreciate her like I thought I would, Megumi in the other hand, didn´t start great but in the final arc had his moment, and his devolpment togheter with his quick backstory made him an enjoyable character. I also appreciated Gojo and Todo, Gojo is that funny and overpowered sensei, he´s something like Urahara from Bleach but with better moments, he brought what I consider the greatest moments in the show, and Todo was just funny as hell which made me appreciate him aswell. About the main character, I didn´t like him, his moments and his writing was just not for me, tho I didn´t enjoy his character I wouldn´t say he´s a bad character either, he´s funny and brings up some nice moments to the anime, but nothing more. Even with all this bad review about the anime, there are some sort of things that stand out in this series: The comedy, the incredible deliver of a good production (animation) and the power system. From all those good catagories I´ve just mentioned, the one I fuck with the most is certainly the power system, the way they introduced the curse magic and the way they explained how it works was absolutely well done and easy to understand, the use of the curse magic troughout the series was also quite interesting and good looking. Overall, I think Jujutsu Kaisen is a decent anime, not the one I expected when I decided to watch, but it´s decent even with all the weakness behind the plot and it´s characters. Would I recomend? Maybe for new watchers, tho this wouldn´t be my first recomendation to a new anime watcher. In general I rate it a 6, it has some cool arcs and moments, and the production is outstanding. Tho this first season was weak, future seasons can make this anime a better one than it is. Feel free to disagree with my review, after all this is a matter of opinions and I stand by a healthy acceptance of each.",6,Ghosttfy

                Jujutsu Kaisen to me would be somewhat close to My Hero Academia in how they tell their story.
They told the story throughout this season similar to how My Hero does, but only in 24 episodes instead of across many seasons, which I kind of prefer.
Keeping the main characters down to a small handful really helped the story move at a good pace, which makes me excited for the Second season.
I only really give this a 6 because I thought it was going to be a bigger anime, so my expectations were up high. I think the second season will be what I thought this anime
                  would bring it, as understandably you need to have your world's system and introductions explained and to show off how your world works in a story.
I would totally recommend giving this a watch all the way through.",6,AngelChrome

This anime is outstanding. Story, art, sound and everything else. The thing i most enjoy in this anime has to be the comedy and the fights. I really like that Toudou, Aoi decides his best friend over how a person likes a girl. And this might only be for me but i love how Inumaki, Toge can only speak about what he eats (dont really know how to explain it but if you have seen the show you should understand) like when he says Frosted Flakes and Salmon, its just really funny for me.

Naruto eats some special fingers and gains a Yami-Yugi inside his body. Then he makes friends with Sasuke.

                Does Jujutsu Kaisen present a completely original story populated by never-seen-or-done-before  characters?
Does Jujutsu Kaisen display deep plot nuance steeped in deeper meaning?
Does Jujutsu exhibit any restraint employing cliche shounen tropes?
Well, the answer to all these questions is a resounding nope and if someone is coming along to Jujusu Kaisen looking for all the above, then they would most likely be severely disappointed. Yet, all the shounen genre cliches and tropes from the relentless talking exposition to the off-the-shelf stock characterization are assembled here and executed with so much relentless energy and a sense of fun. I liked and cared about the core characters because
                  I found them likable and easy to root for. The supporting cast were sufficiently quirky and off-the-wall without straying into stupid territory. 
It also looks and sounds very good with off-the-charts fight sequences taking center stage with superb animation and great choreography paired with nicely paced soundtrack. Those seeking great action will find plenty here.
The story is not anything new but it is told clearly and well enough. The narrative always has forward momentum, constantly progressing with the slightest moments of introspection.
It is hard to not compare Jujutsu Kaisen with Demon Slayer where likable cast wades through pretty well-worn narrative path while serving up a kinetic visual and aural treat but fans of the genre will find plenty to like here. In short, did I have a blast with Jujutsu Kaisen. Well the answer is resounding yup.",9,dasgood

                Jujutsu Kaisen is the latest modern shonen to gain instant popularity the moment of its debut. Not hearing the endless praise it received for its animation quality was near impossible. It was a familiar atmosphere reminiscent of when Demon Slayer aired. And similarly to Demon Slayer, there was little discussion about anything else beyond the animation. A signal that communicated this might be an average shonen of style over substance. Demon Slayer was able to prove itself as an excellent battle shonen above its genericness. Therefore, Jujutsu Kaisen deserved to be given a chance. Well the chance has been given and it's unfortunate to say
                  those first impressions can now be confirmed.
This series provides an experience all too familiar in the genre. Curses are the physical manifestations of negative emotions that unknowingly plague humanity in this world. Jujutsu sorcerers are tasked with protecting mankind by exorcising these monsters. A familiar setup such as this summoned the standard shonen structure. We are treated to yet another fictional universe where monsters terrorize humans and a heroic organization takes responsibility for combating them. Naturally, this includes superpowered high schoolers fighting supernatural villains and everyone fighting in unique ways with their special powers. Sometimes it avoids being too predictable by taking unexpected turns. Otherwise, the series is missing something to make it stand out because it feels like a show you’ve seen before.
Jujutsu Kaisen could have evolved into something special if the execution of its narrative was better. The journey commences when Yuji Itadori is brought into jujutsu sorcery after absorbing a fragment of the “King of Curses”, Ryomen Sukuna. Accepting his new responsibility as a vessel motivates Yuji to find and absorb the rest of Sukuna’s soul. This established goal quickly became an afterthought moments after its introduction. Either the fragments appear randomly or the characters get lucky enough to come across one. Instead, the narrative is focused on being a monster-of-the-week adventure filled with information overload. The action continuously moves from one moment to the next thanks to how well paced everything is to give the series some credit. But a majority of time is spent on either curse fighting missions or jujutsu students fighting amongst themselves. During this time is when they explain the structure behind curses or how abilities work with lengthy exposition. New terms are sporadically introduced to an overwhelming degree to a point where a dictionary is almost required to keep up. And all the terms either sounded like something made up or like they slapped the word “cursed” in front of any word. These aspects are what hold the story back from growing beyond being a typical shonen tale. 
Yuji is accompanied by his fellow jujutsu sorcerers, Nobara Kugisaki and Megumi Fushiguro, in these curse hunting escapades. This trio is clearly inspired by Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno from the Naruto series. Yuji is a somewhat simple-minded kid with superhuman physical ability who values friendship. His motivation is that he wants people to have a “proper death”, meaning dying peacefully after having a good life. Therefore, he tries to help and save as many people as he can like any hero would. Being a jujutsu sorcerer puts him in uncomfortable situations where he learns the harsh reality that it's impossible to save everyone. Megumi is his polar opposite, being stoic, less expressive, and level headed. He escapes the “rival character” trope by instead having a genuine friendship with Yuji. Megumi is also capable of showing that he does care underneath his toughness. Which is shown in his belief that the only people worth saving are good people. Nobara is prideful and confident in her self-image. Being proud of who she was as a woman and a sorcerer allowed her to not be afraid to be herself. Always refreshing to see another female shonen protagonist escape being the token girl in the group. The best part about the three of them was their comradery. Comedic moments worked because of their chemistry with each other. However, the trio makes it hard to form a connection with them because they lack depth. They remain stagnant throughout the season with only little instances of growth in their characters. Megumi and Nobara also get significantly less screen time compared to Yuji. Overall, the three of them are good enough as protagonists.
The instructor of these young and upcoming jujutsu sorcerers is Gojo Satoru. The Naruto influence continues because he is comparable to Kakashi Hatake. He’s the nonchalant teacher with a mysterious vibe to him that is an expert at what they do. Unlike Kakashi however, Gojo is an empty character. He gained instant popularity because he has everything he needs to make him aesthetically cool. He is an unbeatable force with a solid character design. The only aspect about him that is interesting is his distrust in the Jujutsu High School system. Gojo is nothing but a walking brick wall with a name attached besides that. 
There are other students in the Jujutsu High School system that make up the side characters. They all have their established personality and a backstory. Similar to the main trio, the issue is that they lack substance. Especially someone like the cursed speech user, a character who doesn’t speak and has no expression. Someone like him makes you question what purpose they serve. Some of the characters are better than others, such as Maki. But regardless, they are a serviceable side cast. 
The villains are worse in comparison. A group of intelligent curses believing curses are the superior beings are being led by a human for unknown reasons. Besides Mahito, their names do not stick because they are forgettable. Their goals boil down to being evil for the sake of it and wanting to take over the world. They also show up whenever just to cause trouble. Jujutsu Kaisen’s villains are one of the weaker aspects of the show. 
Being an excellent battle shonen is even a far-fetched idea because the battle system is the worst part about the series. Jujutsu sorcerers and curses have access to cursed energy, energy created from negative emotions. Controlling your cursed energy is what allows you to perform cursed techniques, also called jujutsu. When you go past the fundamentals is when this system falls apart. The concept of cursed energy falls somewhere between being overly complicated and not being fleshed out enough. Without a solid understanding, battles make no sense to a point where everything seems to be fueled by randomness. Eliminating space and time, remotely controlling androids, and literally creating matter were all possible feats that you were supposed to believe came from cursed energy. Randomness also opened the door for both nonexistent power scaling and characters consistently pulling out “secret techniques”. It's impossible to tell where jujutsu sorcerers and curses stack against each other in terms of power. Then you have someone like Yuji being able to perform a special ability perfectly after just learning about it. Sometimes cursed energy isn’t even necessary because people are born superhuman in this world without an explanation. Yuji and other characters are able to pull off superhuman feats like catching bullets or jumping two stories high for no reason. Cursed energy is more of an excuse to allow the author to explore his imagination instead of being a legitimate system.
You’ll enjoy yourself more if you dismiss the details of the battle system and approach the fights as visual showcases. There are some genuinely awesome action sequences you’ll see throughout the season once you do. This is because of the high quality animation reminiscent of an animated movie. While the soundtrack shared this same level of quality with its amazing selection. The music synced up with scenes perfectly and the first opening theme is on its way to becoming a classic. Conversely, the art direction was average. It looked like how a modern anime should look and nothing more. The animation and soundtrack alone were enough to show that the production values were worthy of their praise. Mappa did an excellent job with the presentation because the battles are a spectacle.
Jujutsu Kaisen is another shonen that is only a satisfactory endeavor. Checking off the right boxes is what leads to it being popular. People are drawn into what is on the surface: solid animation, cool fights, and likable enough characters. Look further and you’ll find it doesn’t do anything else exceptionally well. The story is paper thin with both passable protagonists and terrible antagonists. With the battle system being one of the worst you could find in the genre. You are watching this strictly because it is an entertaining battle marathon that is pleasant to look at.

                Jujutsu Kaisen is honestly very close to a masterpiece in my eyes. I enjoyed it nearly as much as I enjoyed Demon Slayer, so if you also enjoyed Demon Slayer, I'd recommend giving this a quick read.
It's got an intriguing plot, to start. The premise is perfect for setting up a complex and interesting story, but not in such a way that it would eventually become convoluted. It was easy to follow (more towards the beginning) and drew me in. However, the reason I gave the story a 8/10 is because of the way it sort of veers off of the base plotline later on
                  in the series. Obviously, we can't have the storyline stick to one plot the entire way through. But I feel as though at least a rough faithfulness to the original concept is needed to really drive a story home and make it 10/10. Demon Slayer's concept is that Tanjiro sets out to save his sister, which is the main point, although the storyline sometimes veers. Soul Eater's concept is that Maka and Soul must collect Kishin souls to turn Soul into a death scythe, which is the main point, although the storyline sometimes veers.
Jujutsu Kaisen does a relatively okay job at sticking to the concept of Yuuji collecting and consuming Sukuna's fingers, at least, in the start. But later on, it starts to shift the focus further and further away from that base idea, until it's possible that you may forget about it entirely for a few episodes due to the lack of Sukuna's presence or the mention of the fingers. The end redeems this a bit, but it feels sudden to me. Regardless, I look forward to where the anime takes it in the future, and hope to see the base concept more faithfully stuck to. (Unless, of course, I read the manga, in which case I hope to find that the manga returns to this concept).
As with any anime made by MAPPA, it's needless and redundant to say that the art and animation are all positively gorgeous. A ten in every sense of the rating, I'd dare say MAPPA has even outdone themselves with this particular series. Never a single moment in this show that I wasn't admiring the outstanding quality of animation.
Character wise, once again, a ten in every sense of the rating. All of the main and main-side cast are intriguing characters, and make me either love (or hate) them unconditionally. They're all given amazing depth. The women in this show aren't fanserviced beyond belief nor is there a semblance of fanservice in the series to begin with. The women are interesting, just as interesting as the men, they have character and personality and I love them all so much. They're strong, they don't need to be ""saved"" at any point, even as Yuuji carries Nobara away from danger, she immediately gets back into action as he's carrying her and covers his back!
And finally, enjoyment. I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed this series. Even if the storyline in particular has flaws in my eyes, even if I don't believe the other aspects can necessarily ""make up"" for that portion of criticism, I was hooked on every episode. I highly recommend this show for anyone who has an appreciation of shonen.",9,Lunachuu

                Story: 5/10
The story isn't anything special. If anything, it felt like a collage of other popular shonen mangas' plots. I couldn't bring myself to really care about the main plotline, i found the villains in particular to be quite uninteresting (i'll go further into it later on). Honestly, it's as generic as it gets in this aspect and there isn't anything wrong with it, there is a HUGE market for generic shounen and every once in a while, I feel like watching things of that sort which is why I managed to finish it without much complaint.
Art: 9/10
If there's anything this anime did right it's
                  the art. The animation is smooth and appealing and, in general, it reminded me a bit of kyoani's work. Then why is it a 9 and not a 10? because of the source material, mostly. I thought the character design tried too hard to make them seem ""different"" without losing the bishounen design that drives horny girls into opening their wallets to buy the merch. I mean, it's fine, but all three main guys have essentially the same design (pointy, slim features with spiky hair) and it kinda bothered me.
Sound: 10/10
I thought the soundtrack was solid (though not as memorable as other shonen titans like snk, bnha and kny), I liked the voice acting of all the characters, in particular Nobara's, the VA is a genius.
Characters: 7/10
Like I said previously, the character design for the main characters is really lacking, they essentially just changed the direction of their hair, changed their hair color and gave 2/3 a little ""something"" to make their eyes look different (covering them or a separate pair that basically just looks like eyelids) and called it a day. The character design for the female characters is even blander but I can forgive that just because of how much I loved Nobara as a character. I absolutely love how she's just here to kick ass and annoy everyone else (except for her beloved Maki). I don't know, I just liked her, and I liked her weird attack style using a hammer and nails, that's pretty cool. Overall, it would've been a 5 but i gave it +2 points exclusively for Nobara. Hope they don't ruin her character later on.
Enjoyment: 8/10
I found it very enjoyable. JJK is just dumb violence and I liked that, it was fun. I definitely didn't have to force myself to finish it like with other shows and I really enjoyed myself while watching it (especially the filler episodes)
Overall: 7/10
It was just good. It wasn't amazing but it wasn't as bad as some people are making it out to be.

                Months ago, when I had first heard of Jujutsu Kaisen and its ""similarities"" with Bleach, which is one of my all-time favorite anime shows, I was very curious and the subsequently growing hype just added to the excitement. And as I finished it in merely two days, I was left very impressed and entertained to the core. Jujutsu Kaisen is MAPPA's striking new achievement which has set the bar for action anime shows, very high and hard to top.
At first, the concept revolving around the talisman sounded very original, unique and seemed like something the whole thing would revolve around. That's where I was slightly
                  surprised, since the show didn't follow it entirely and instead also focused on different characters, meaning the protagonist Yuji Itadori was not allowed to completely dominate the show, which is rare. Rather, his teacher and an absolute fan-favorite Satoru Gojo stole the show with his cool heroic moments, many of which can send a shiver down your spine! For a secondary character, he truly gets to shine a lot, and other characters one can actually expect to great primary treatment, mainly Itadori's friends Nobara and Megumi, too shine when the right time comes.
The plot initially moves at a very fast pace, leaving little to no room for characters to grow on you easily. However, that is achieved later on as we get introduced to them again and again through the skillfully drawn, beautifully colored and overall masterfully crafted action scenes. Every fight sequence is executed with intensity and the right usage of music and colors just adds to the brilliance. I was very impressed with the usage of red, blue, white and black, in the last few episodes. MAPPA surely knows how to adapt a manga faithfully and breathe life into the story by using colors adequately and artistically.
Plus, while it's also a lot gorier than I imagined, given this is still a shounen, even moments of gore seemed more like abstract art instead of mindless violence, which is a rare feat to achieve. Jujutsu Kaisen has strong characters, both male and female, and are used effectively throughout the 24 episodes. There's some humor too, as expected from any shounen, and it doesn't disappoint. But it's mostly the fight sequences that stand out as the show's biggest highlight. This is a pure action anime, so while some of you might have issues getting into the plot initially given the fast pace and nonstop action, it will slowly cast its spell on you and the effects will be visible in no time. Just make sure to grab some popcorn and beverages (something I unfortunately couldn't) before you sit down to binge this supernatural action thriller. You're in for one wild ride!",10,PrashastSingh

                Overall, this anime wasnt a total wow factor, but as I kept watching the more I enjoyed it. The fight scenes were really what made this up, and the comedic effects were well-timed and not overdone. However, many interactions felt rushed or out of place, and there were a few episodes where I was struggling to want to watch this anime. It started off great with Itadori eating his first Sukuna finger, but quickly turned pretty boring.
Quick breakdown of each ranking category:
Story - I pretty much covered this in my overall review, the fight scenes, and Itadori's massive growth with Toudou as well as the
                  end part of the anime were the best and most enjoyable parts for me. I didnt like that much of the show was focused on the battle between schools, it didnt feel like it belonged and the only thing interesting to get out of that was the abilities of the Kyoto school members.
Art- Animation was amazing, particularly during the battle scenes and especially with Itadori's abilities and Nobara's most iconic moment at the end where she evolves her straw doll techniques. I also LOVED both openings to the anime.
Sound - Not very good. Although yes I did mention that I loved both openings to the anime, including the music choice, the second ending was so boring and I skipped it every time after the first. The musical selection during the show as well was very odd and unfitting, especially with the old man and his rock guitar was annoying (and felt irrelevant) and the interaction between Maki and Miwa.
Character - I loved the overall development between the 3 main characters, and it is very easy to like Gojo Satoru. None of the other characters had any real flaws, although I wouldve liked it to be clear on who is the rat between Jujutsu High and the special grades.
Enjoyment- Mentioned in overall, but it was hard to force myself to watch episodes really up until Toudou and Itadori fight that special grade together.",8,notawaffle
40748,"
                I enjoyed this way more then I thought I would. So much so I dare say this is THE strongest first season any shonen anime had ever got so far. 
The animation is god like, like seriouslly, someone eating a sandwich in this show is better animated then some whole shows. 
The characters are, for me, REALLY charismatic. And their banter is funny to watch. Some take more time to warm up then others, but eventually they click and you're laughing or hyping them just every other character you knew for longer in the cast. 
The plot did not take off yet, but I read
                  the manga since the end of season 1 and OH BOY, some of the best stuff Weekly shonen Jump ever published is in it's way. 
Overall, I trully reccomend it. It starts fun and Hype, but huh, fair warning, stuff gets dark, and I mean REALLY dark as it goes on. The author was influenced by Togashi after all, and it shows in the tone.",9,tlbchunchunmaru
40748,"
                BEWARE: POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS - I see a lot of people comparing Jujutsu Kaisen to Naruto in how it's similar to it, and whilst I do agree, the way I see Jujutsu Kaisen is basically Bleach without swords.
A lot of the story beats near the beginning are pretty similar- the first episode for instance: he's a normal high school kid who has 2 people close to him attacked by a weird monster, where he decides to go fight it despite being told to go by someone who knows about how to fight these monsters. In Bleach, Ichigo's a normal high school kid who has 2
                  people close to him (in this case his two sisters) attacked by a weird monster, where he decides to fight it despite being told to go by someone who knows how to fight these monsters.
But even with the protagonist and the world we're given, it's very similar. In Bleach, Ichigo doesn't really know what to do with his life, much like a real life teenager, and he doesn't have some giant goal like Hokage or Wizard King. Yuji is the same, he is just kind of doing it because of something his 5-seconds-of-screentime grandfather told him to do before he died.
Characters are probably the weakest point in Kaisen. Kugisaki is great, but Fushiguro is just another edgy 'I don't save people' sort of guy. Gojo is just Kisuke Urahara with the looks of Kakashi. He's actually one of my least favourite characters, not only because he's the most blatant clone of a pre-existing popular Shonen character but also just because he seems built to be the fan favourite, and that comes across as inauthentic.
Spirit energy is here, only now it's called Curse energy, complete with the same exercise like in Bleach, where you have to focus said energy into some sort of object and messing up can occur in something bad happening (explosion in Bleach, attack in JJK). Sukuna's fingers are in similar veign to the rings of the dead from Zombiepowder (Kubo's debut manga). Yuji vs Sukuna in the same body is much akin to Ichigo's hollow self especially in soul society, in my opinion though it is handled better as Sukuna is a selfish individual who only does things for his own gain (like trying to take over Itadori's body).
The soundtrack... isn't great. There's a lot of songs that sound nice in the ears when they're played but in the end none of them really stick out or become memorable. 
The story itself is ok, I'm only 7 episodes in. It's nothing mindblowing but it's a good Shounen story.
Visually it's brilliant, animation when nothing's happening can be a bit choppy, but there's amazing lighting, shots, fight animation, character designs and settings - it looks amazing.
But what really stands out to me is how enjoyable this show is. The characters may be nothing new, but they go together really well. The story may not be anything special, but it's extremely entertaining. The show's humour is similar to that of most other Shounen (I feel copying off of Bleach's humour could have actually been a plus in this scenario), but there's a ton of stuff to laugh at. 
I think however a big downside is that the character's aren't really people to get invested in. I'm yet to see an Ichigo vs Grandfisher moment, or anything like that, partly because our characters aren't enough to be invested in emotionally. Sure they're funny and they work well together, but if one of them were to just up and die I wouldn't feel anything.
It's not original, it could be much better, but for what it is it's an enjoyable watch that you'll find often thrilling and often funny, but never very emotionally compelling.",7,Jay-Stevenson

                As always a foreword before I begin. This review is based only on the anime and is subjective as all reviews are, but lend me some of your time and I'll try to convince you why or why not this is an anime for you! All this while trying to avoid spoilers at all costs (Most of the presented information other than one or two things can be read on the MAL summary and characters and story description are kept vague to not ruin the readers interest).
To be quite honest this one was quite a pickle for me. On one side Shounen anime are a
                  dime a dozen and they all follow the same familiar tropes. So why would this one be worth your time then? I was not convinced myself, but decided to try on a whim and something seemed familiar about this one. 
So if you're like me something will ring a bell. The begining had strong Bleach vibes to it. This comparison will be quite frequent throught the anime to be quite honest(I had the urge to go Bankai! at some moves which are called domain extensions ). After watching some episodes I stumbled upon a intreview with the author. He said that Tite Kubo and Bleach are his main reasons for going into manga. So It got me curious. How much work will be ""inspired by"" and how much will be original? Safe to say that although you can feel some similarity Jujutsu Kaisen stands well on its own but not enough to make it the next big thing.
Story
Well as far as story goes we have the quite popular supernatural stuff happening all around and our heroes must find a way to deal with them. Adding to that we have an organisation called Jujutsu Technical High School other than raising future sorcerers its in charge of cursed item overlooking and dealing with curses and other phenomena which of course has its own agenda and motives. 
This is not an overall complex story which (what I actually frequently say) is not a bad thing depending on the genre. If there are things that make up for it. For some viewers this will be a con especially if they are not action fans.
Jujustsu Kaisen actually has an OK worldbuilding done. Shame that its not expanded more heavily but maybe this will change in future seasons(if we get those). 
Art
The art is great. No more no less. Characters are well detailed and the way they move around in the environment is done superb. We have a lot of fluid and fast action sequences which tend to get botched in shounen productions. Not here. The movement incorporates various sliding, jumping, using the enviroment to a characters advantage with no loss in animation quality. 
One thing that I really like here is the way the powers where animated. This one is done like traditional ink paintings and its marvelous. Definetly a great and fitting choice.
Same for the environments which are all around pleasantly done. So no gripe here and I think that even the more demanding art fans will have some ""oh thats cool"" moments.
Sound
Dynamic sequences require an equally dynamic soundtrack and thats what jujutsu chooses. We have a range of fast and heavy music well fitting the ongoing action sequences. Furthermore sound effects themselves are good. They give a nice feel of heaviness to the blows that each character deals and recieves. I gave 8 here because no opening or ending caught my ear. Not to say that they are bad but sometimes they just have to ring the right bells to stay in your head for a longer time and those did not. Overall solid work here as far as shounen style goes.
Character
Jujutsu's main cast is quite solid and all of them have a reason for fighting and becoming sorcerers. Quite a lot of characters are present here so I will focus on the main ones. Our hero Itadori Yuuji is more of a traditional shounen protagonist. Not very bright but with a heart of gold and uncanny fighting and physical prowess. Thrown into the world of curses and sorcerers only because he wanted to save some people. In time there are other problems and things Yuuji deals with and some moments have a nice character development to them (such a shame that its to the end of this season).
Fushiguro Megumi the first sorceres our protagonist meets and also one of the more interesting ones. Brooding and silent Megumi emanates an air of mystery. In time we get more information on his background and abilities but the more he reveals the more questions we have. Nobara Kugisaki a gril from the countryside joining the Jujutsu College for what seems like shallow reasons like money. But that is far from the truth and under what seems to be a self absorbed individual we have a girl with no hesitation to jump in to save her friends.
Last but not least Gojou Satoru known as the most powerful sorcerer. He works as a teacher in Jujutsu College Tokyo branch and acts as a mentor to our characters. But in his own goofy and eccentric kind off way. He comes off as a very happy go lucky character in most situations but actually his are one of the strongest and most interesting motives in Jujutsu world.
The support cast also has a strong plethora of characters which Toudou Aoi would be my favourite. An excellent blend of senpai and comedy relief. Toudou is a man to watch out for. Sadly saying something about the rest of the cast would make this review even longer(and I'm not sure that everyone would like that ^_^).   
Enjoyment
It was quite enjoyable I have to say. The fear I had of it being another copy paste shounen with the ol ""My power is more powerful than your power!"" or ""So now I will tell you my evil plan and exactly how my technique works"" was premature. This one actually knows about those tropes and uses them to some degree as and advantage. Like one enemy going with the how this exactly works, but doing it to trigger panic and make the technique work faster. It was quite a nice touch. 
One other thing that Jujutsu has which is a plus is the world building. We are presented with some organisations, motives and people and the exact right amount of information to both have us interested(and presenting some questions and mysteries) and to keep us informed(like a characters background that has a direct effect on his motivation or style of sorcery). 
Jujutsu Kaisen shuffles between a serious and comedy tone. So if you don't like silly jokes and baka moments this will be a minus for you and they are actually quite frequent. As for me this was neither a bad nor a good thing because from the get go we have signals that this tone will be common throughthout. 
I'm afraid that all those things are not quite enough to elevate it to the cream of the crop. 
There are shortcomings and not all of the basic shounen traps have been avoided, but that does not take away from this being and ejoyable watch. 
Overall
To sum up this is a good watch. No spectacular over complex story telling but a lot of fast packed action sequences with the right amount of lore and information. If you're a fan of that you will be at home here. Definetly not for everyone and people that are not fans of flashy action sequences will lose intrest. The right amount of mystery and lore should be sufficient for most but we are left with a sense of lacking in some departments. This is not something a future season can not fix! And that is a plus because with momentum and experience Jujutsu Kaisen can be even more enjoyable.
If you are a fan of shounen anime give this one a try I think you will be pleased as for the other people if your watch list is heavy on waiting to air why not give this one a try. You could be in for an OK watch and nice time spender.

                Do you like Naruto? If so you shouldn't watch Boruto, watch this series instead. We have Naruto who not alone (also his new Kurama), Sasuke that do not have a lot of hatred, the useful Sakura and easy going Kakashi. Maybe the author got inspired from Naruto series but the difference about JJK and Naruto is JJK is more compact.
JJK is not kind anime that put filler ball in the story. They have plenty and necessary supporting cast, unique battle system and fast pace story. In this 24 episode we all ready see Itadori eat 5 of Sukuna fingers out of 20 almost 25% of
                  part of the story. So it won't go as long running anime like Naruto, Bleach, One piece, BNHA, Fairy Tail, etc. 
The animation visual is very good, the development of character of Fushiguro is essential to the story, they also have good amount of comedic relief to put story in the story. The enemy is not something grand like Akatsuki or Kaguya but they are very dangerous.
In conclusion this series is upgraded version of usual shonen battle anime that won't have hundred of episode. if you invest your time you probably get the good amount of return. They also have movie that aired in January 2022.",9,Inaco

The chills that this series gives you its like urghhh what's gonna happen next!!!!
And the best part of this anime? THE POST CREDITS AAAAAAAA (Jujutsu Strolling). Please I beg you to always wait after the credits. That's the best! So hilarious and memorable for me. I
                  just wish that they make a separate series of Jujutsu Kaisen Strolling HAHHAHAHA.

                jujutsu kaisen is a very good anime to watch the story revolves around the jujutsu tech exorcism the supernatural monsters and curses 
       The characters are probably the second greatest part of the anime. Yuuji is such a good shounen protagonist, he isn't annoying and doesn't scream all the time, is quite care free. On the other hand, the other members of the MC trio are just so fun to watch, Fushigoro and Nobara both. I'd be lying if I said that it didn't remind me of Naruto a little bit. The fun little rivalry between Yuuji and Fushigoro,
                  just like Naruto and Sasuke, except better. And isn't it a breath of fresh air, finally having a female MC that isn't annoying and absolutely useless. In episode 23, when Nobara was suddenly getting sucked into a gate, instead of screaming and crying for help, she just showed Fushigoro a thumbs up, saying that she'll be fine, like the badass she is! God I love the characters.
The character goals are really interesting, which also makes the characters, interesting. Yuuji isn't like other shounen nice guys who refuse to kill people like Deku, he has an actual reason to do that. He highly commends ""the value of life"". He also does good deeds because he wants to die peacefully and be remembered as a good person, quite a simple but respectable goal. Fushigoro is probably my second favourite character in JJK. He is very secretive and stoic, all while caring for his friends. In episode 23, we got to see a different side of him, and honestly he has so much depth to him. I normally hate female delinquent characters so much, I can't stand them as much as I can't stand Tsunderes. I hate how they go ""Kimochi warui"" after everything. But Nobara is different. She is very talkative during battles, verbally destroying the shit outta the opponent, all while being badass as fuck during all times. She also deeply cares about his friends, she is a great character. Not only this, but side characters like Panda, Maki, Inumaki. Every- again LITERALLY EVERY CHARACTER in this anime is so fucking good and interesting, even the antagonists like Sukuna and Mahito have a considerable amount of depth to them which everyone can comprehend, which makes them so good.
Let me tell you this, an entire paragraph isn't enough to explain how amazing and interesting the characters are.
The only part JJK is a bit lacking in is story. Since it's only season 1 and the story hasn't expanded much, but even still, the story is a bit generic. It feels like a typical monster of the week kind of story. Even the story is a bit average now, all other aspects carry this anime. And yes, the story switches tones really quick, it goes from a dark and gritty tone to a light hearted tone pretty fast. And the best part is that they perfectly execute it.
No one said that an anime must excel at all aspects. There was no boring moment in the entire anime, despite the story being typical, I always thoroughly enjoyed it.
The Juju Strolls are a perfect addition after the end of every episode, no matter how tense an episode is, the Juju Strolls are entertaining to watch.
Now about sound, it's amazing. The 2 opening sequences and ending sequences are all so amazing. Especially the amazing opening from Eve and the great ending from ALI. After that, there's the voice acting. Most people can't differentiate between good voice acting and bad voice acting, but I have noticed that a good amount of anime often fail at properly delivering dialogues. JJK's voice acting feels genuine and natural, so big props to the talented voice actors. Soundtrack is also quite lacking. It's not the best there is, but it works. Of course, I don't expect all anime to have Sawano level soundtracks.
Another thing that I need to separately mention are the eye catchers. If you don't know what eye catchers are, they are those intro type of clips that are often in the middle of an episode. JJK's eye catchers are so captivating, they have this horror-y feeling to it.
Now to sum it all up in one sentence: Jujutsu Kaisen is great.
JJK has to be one of the greatest new gen shounens. As for whether you should watch it or not- YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD. I don't always tell people so confidently to watch an anime. It is the start of a new era through Jujutsu Kaisen, and I'm damn interested to see where it's gonna go from here. See you all in the next season!",9,omiii_

                Ok both the op and ed and every ost and sound was absolute bangers what a fine ass soundtrack man and the animation was really cool and jujutsu kaisen is your typical shounen anime there isn't anything interesting in the story but that doesn't mean it's bad i actually sort of enjoyed it was pretty good my favorite characters so far are Panda and mechamaru and yaga and toudou although the anime wasn't really great in terms of story because it sort of reminded me of demon slayer for some reason but at least it has a great cast of characters shame that's they only
                  played a big role for one arc and i also liked yuji's fear of death like it's something groundbreaking but it justs shows his human fear of dying that i think most people such as me can relate to and each character was quite good but sadly they were underused and the curse power system looked pretty interesting i was really invested in it but what i didn't liked is that they didn't really focused on it which made fight scenes characters can pull a power out of nowhere and all that shit but at least we knew a part of afew powers these guys have and this anime has potential for both power systems and world building it was a decent watch overall 6/10 it's not the most original thing but a decent watch

Now, people might be quick to say that this anime is 'overhyped' or 'overrated' since its already getting so much recognition, but it really deserves it. The fight scenes are amazingly drawn and well put together. It really gets my adrenaline going, tbh. The plot is really straight-forward in my opinion. It's nothing you have to analyze to really get the whole story. This anime is perfect if you're just looking for amazing fight scenes and nothing more. 
To be frank, the MC might not be everyone's cup of tea. He does have the same generic backstory of a family member dying and now he
                  wants to work hard for them. He's not that profound or anything, but the show would not be the same without him. He acts as the comedic relief while simultaneously being the serious bad-ass protagonist. If you're not one to be picky about the depth the main character has, then you'll probably love him. 
Okay, but don't even get me started about the outro. I love it so much, truly. After ending the show on a serious cliffhanger, you get shitty drawn characters breakdancing. If that doesn't get you to watch the show then I don't know what will. 
Also Megumi and Yuuji are hot asf",8,erenapologist
40748,"
Alrighty….Jujutsu Kaisen is a show I have mixed feelings about, it's a very well polished show and has objectively good things to it as well,but because of some underwhelming things here and there, its hard for it to be an anime that sticks out to me.
The Story
Its very basic,the first arc is the gang fighting curses and evil people, and the second arc is basically just MHA plot(as in the students fight one another but suddenly their plan is ruined by a super evil villain).Its pretty cut and paste,which isnt baaad necessarily its just the other things about the show I find just meh.It has
                  that same problem that Bleach has, where the worldbuilding and power dynamics are so creative and well thought out,but the characters behind them are kinda one dimensional.Also I dont feel a grand sense of scale with whats happening,which is expected for an anime with only one season,but by the end,it just felt like the only thing that did change in the show was the power levels and thats it.Sure the group encounter newer and stronger villains but the villains that truly matter just pop in, rustle for a bit,and then fuck right off to let the henchmen do their work.Even Sukuna, the biggest baddie the show teases about only shows up in the show like 4 or 5 times.
The Animation/Art
I don't even know if I should even talk about it.We all know its great,that's nothing new,the choreography is stunning and the animation goes to film levels at times,but to be honest I don't even want to talk about it anymore because im not a huge fan of judging how good a show is based on how well its animated.Sadly with JJK the only thing I can say that represents its style IS its animation.It's just the other things i'm kinda meh on, the character designs are kinda half baked compared to other shounens and unlike other shounens I can't really distinguish JJK’s art style, every time i try, i just think of the color brown.
The Sound
Music is fine,the songs are catchy, VA’s did a good job.That's all I can say.
The Characters
This is where I feel like my enjoyment takes a bit of a hit.Don’t get me wrong, the characters have good chemistry and are enjoyable to watch,but outside of that, I just really didn't care about anyone.The only thing that defines characters in JJK are the powers they have, they are super vivid and wild, but stripping those elements out, the characters are just kinda hollow.Their personalities are so similar to each other they might as well be interchangeable, and the most i can say about them is “woah,they are cool and have cool powers.” The only special character I remember is Toudou, I think its clever having his subconscious basically just be a highschool scene, but his abrasive personality of liking idols and judging people based on what taste they have in women is just a bit overkill for me.Other characters like Fushiguro and Kento stick out as well,but they brood so much,I just don't really have any feelings towards them at all. But excluding those people, most of the character development comes from backstories, and the backstories are so weak sauce.They’re mostly like “oh no, my friend died” or “oh no, my...sister moved away” or “oh no, I punched a guy and met a girl”.
Even then in some cases, the backstories dont really go anywhere or develop a character,because the only thing that does develop about the character is the powers they have.I liked that element about it,until I realized that the fucking power system in JJK is broken as hell. Some of the sorcerers are described as some of the weakest but are still OP as hell, and even by the final episode Itadori and the others might as well have graduated the damn school,because they basically have these super strong powers that they unlock so quickly that they beat more enemies than even the teachers at Tokyo Jujutsu High School do.
Though I will admit, the overpoweredness in this anime was handled a lot better than GOH, and I also love how final battle actually developed the characters a part of them,not through necessarily making them suffer and pull through with willpower,but just by letting go of their fear and letting their primal instinct basically turn them into absolutely savage beasts by the end.Those moments were one of the few bits of brilliance but still,they were only bits compared to the whole pie.
Enjoyment-
And for now I feel like this pie is just a sample size, I know I shouldn't expect a lot for a show with only one season,but JJK compared to other shounens after their season 1’s(like aot,mob psycho etc) didn't really leave too much of an impression on me, I feel a lot of the elements about this show leaving my mind, and when i wake up tomorrow, the only thing I will remember is the powers and cool fight scenes.I know it looks like im shitting on this anime,but it's far from being bad.Its just that the good things about it are things that literally everyone has praised at this point, and the other things im just kinda meh on.

                To be frankly honest, I think Jujutsu Kaisen is overrated. 
From the get go it seemed like a poor copy from Naruto. The protagonist even says identical stuff like ""I am going to take all that hatred on me"". The team surrounding the protagonist resemble Naruto's team as well. The sensei is a tall, super strong, white haired hero. The other guy is the cool character with the blue color elements and the girl is a tough, loud screaming one, who teases the protagonist. In the further course of the show, they meet senpais in a tournament, which is disrupted by the evil antagonists. And
                  of course the main character has something evil inside himself. The only thing missing would be that he tames that evil towards the end of show... just like Naruto did. At least that doesn't seem plausible, judging from the story so far.
This didn't bother me too much, as long as the series is in overall a great show, which I thought it would be due to the hype. 
Unfortunately, the Naruto parallels end with the quality of the fights. There are a lot of fights against supposedly way stronger opponents, which end real quick in the favor of the good side. So the fights don't really put you on the edge of the chair, because before you even getting warmed up, they already end. The fight scenes themselves are not too appealing either. The fight choreography is mediocre. I wish they were as good as Naruto fights.
The animation, at least, is really well made. In my opinion, it is the new standard of more modern animes to have good animation. So regarding this aspect, it doesn't stand out neither.
I usually don't write reviews. Also I am not a native English speaker, so please excuse any linguistic mistakes. And don't get me wrong. I liked Jujutsu Kaisen. I just didn't understand the hype over it and people claiming it to be a ""masterpiece"", which build up high expectations that lead to equal high disappointment.",7,AskeladdJaeger

                Here's a show that definitely took me a while to like, but upon completion has really completely changed my perspective on what a shonen can be. Truly a perfect balance in Comedy, Action and Drama all at once exemplified by gorgeous animation provided by MAPPA with a unique modern soundtrack choice that you wouldn't usually see in many shonen anime.
The story took me a while to get invested in, at some point you'd even think the story is just repetitive (Find a curse, exorcise it, rinse and repeat) but later on the story really begins to escalate, with unexpected and shocking moments that will really
                  lead you to expect tension and drama in every arc and thus stakes are very high from the get go and is sure to get you intrigued and wanting for more. However, I would go as far as to say that the story is the weakest element of the show. The single biggest contributor to why the story feels slow and sluggish is due to the poor exposition, or in simpler terms, the overcomplication of the power scaling. I must admit that I had to rewatch an episode more times than not in order to understand the concepts of cursed energy, cursed technique, reversal cursed technique, , domain expansion etc and even then certain abilities such as Gojo's Infinity or Incomplete Domains are still not explained very well (The former required a bit of research for me to grasp the concept). While I enjoy the variety in abilities and cursed techniques that each character possesses, the manner in which these abilities are explained is really poor, especially compared to other shonen in which the abilities are explained very simply (Quirks in MHA, Devil Fruits in One Piece, Ki in Dragon Ball, Breathing in early JoJo and Demon Slayer etc). Unfortunately after catching up with the manga, this issue only becomes worse in later arcs
The animation and visuals are absolutely gorgeous, MAPPA have really outdone themselves to bring Gege's vision to life. I read the manga after completing the anime and I must admit that, although Gege's art is outstanding, MAPPA have really brought out the beauty of scenes, from its fluid fight scenes to its beautiful setting, they manage to really outdo the original art of the manga. It is really a sight to behold. 
The soundtrack choice, as I mentioned earlier, is certainly unique in comparison to the orchestral style soundtrack choices of most other shonen anime, especially more recent ones. It really gives off a modern, rock vibe rather than an epic instrumental sci fi vibe that you'd get with most shonen. A massive hats off to the VAs too for the impressive vocal work (both sub and dub) which really brough out the emotional and comedic scenes of the series to life.
The characters in the series are the best elements of the series, in my opinion. With most shonen protagonists, you really dont get a sense of them being about their age, for instance 16 year old protagonists act very mature for their age and does not give off vibes of being young. Itadori is certainly relatable in the sense that he acts like a real teenager yet has the heroic and moral sense of justice that you'd come to expect from a protagonist, yet despite having such noble ideals, he has been shown to stray from these ideals when pushed to the edge, such as through the death of a friend or murder of civilians. Another aspect that is commonly applauded is the writing of female characters, with Nobara Kugisaki being a prime example, a strong personality yet, similarly to Itadori, really gives a realistic and relatable teenager vibe. The stereotypical damsels in distress that many anime, and even western shows, portray is non existent here. While, I personally like the absence of forced romantic relations in the show as it really helps the characters be fleshed out for who they are rather than simply being a love interest. Satoru Gojo and Megumi Fushiguro are quite likeable characters too but as of this season, haven't been fleshed out enough. While the main antagonists, although not the best out there are interesting enough for you to love to hate them. Even more minor antagonists such as the death paintings in the season finale really give you a subtle sense of humanity within these villains, despite most of them being curses.
In conclusion, The funny at times comedy, fluid and gorgeous visuals and very emotional and dramatic moments is sure to make this show a must watch for any anime fan. Although, as someone who was on the verge of dropping the show due to the slow start and terrible exposition, I admit that the show might not be for everyone. However, I suggest to give the show some patience and I promise that the build up of the story will reap its rewards and may just leave you with a unique sense of enjoyment that you just can't get in other shows",9,Potatobanana

                The thing I love about JJK is that it does all the trope of shounen anime with it's own twist. The characters are what you can find in any average anime but in JJK, the author has worked really well with their personalities. All characters are utilized properly and no one feels out of place or unnecessary. Also, they got the drip. Earlier, I thought that the humor was forced and couldn't really get attached to the characters but the second half was mind-blowing from every aspect. Rather than introducing 100 new characters, they gave some time for everyone to grow on us and maybe
                  one or two characters were not explored much but I'm sure this will be done in the next season. The animation left me speechless at times and it's also sad that this is what AoT could have looked like if Mappa were given enough time. I love AoT but when a show by the same studio is ongoing with such amazing animation, people are gonna compare. About the sound design, both the openings were freaking bangers and really hype you up for the episode. The first ending was visually one of the best I've seen and it will be remembered for a long time. The second ending was really soulful and visually beautiful.

                Finally watched the show after soo many recommendation and not to mention all the hype this show created. I usually dont write many reviews, but i just had to get this one of my chest.
Minor SPOILER warning if you have not seen the series! 
I must say this show didnt attract or impress me the way i hoping for. Maybe i set my expectations too high? 
My main problem with the show is the storlyline! though it is consistent, it does not provide enough of information for the outsider about the jujutsu wolrd.. maybe the subs were too badly done? I couldnt really get the
                  hold on all the curses and cursed energy or curse users :S
The next thing is mentioning or introducing new characters that you never get to know further in the series.. like Okkatsu or the previous winner of the students exchange event.. they keep mentioning these ppl without any more information and that confused me very much.. 
Moving on to the characters. I wish MC had used more of the Sukuna power.. instead he is shown like a superhuman being wiht immense power and energy without any explanation.. Same is the case with Gojo sensei (even though i LOVE him).. 
Nanami was my favorite character, wish they showed more of him!
The onlys reason I am giving this an overall 7 is because of the cast. Finally a woman character who is not useless or helpless! Nobara you ROCK!!!
This is my personal experience with the show. I fully understand if ppl disagree with it and finds the show more amusing than me. If i were to compare it with with an anime, i felt more connected and attracted to Demon Slayer than JJK.

Story: That's basically shounen in vacuum. If you've seen Hunter x Hunter, Naruto, Boku no Hero Academia, The God of High School and some other shounen animes than there is nothing new here in terms of story. The same concept of 3-men team with two guys and one girl. The same chunin exam that has been disrupted by the team of bad guys. Sounds familiar, right? But if you can let yourself forget about all the similarities and just enjoy the anime - it may still work.

                  just basic. Meanwhile animations during fights look pretty good.
Sound: Both pairs of OPs and EDs are good. Some of the fights themes are really awesome (the best one can be heard during the last fight of the anime).
Character: You can find many things you've seen already in shounen animes.
Few examples:
- team consist of redhead light-headed MC who has very angry something trapped in his body, serious black-haired guy and very strong girl;
- their teacher is a cool grey-haired guy with a mask covering part of his face;
- this strange red boots same as you might've seen on The God of High School's MC;
- main antagonist looks exactly like one of the antagonists from Boku no Hero Academia and has almost the same ability.
However some of the supporting characters seem unique and interesting to me in terms of both personalities and character design. Worth mentioning that ability/combat concept here is a combination of the ones from Naruto and Hunter x Hunter.
Enjoyment: While I was spotting sooo many similarities with the animes I've seen already I still enoyned this anime. Probably because it combines all this things the right way and adds darker atmosphere than some of the shounen animes.
Overall: decent 7 to light 8.",8,GG_Allin

                Jujutsu Kaisen - Season 1 (Review):
Introduction:
I gotta admit, I'm a bit of a simp for Jujutsu Kaisen at this point. The drop dead gorgeous animation mixed with the impeccable soundtrack, pretty decent story and great character development just all adds up to make an incredibly enjoyable experience from beginning to end and to be honest, it made my Friday night every week; I'm going to miss this show and I can't wait for more content from it.
Animation:
I can't write a JJK review without gushing a fuck ton about one of the key aspects of what makes it so great - its animation. At its most
                  simple, Jujutsu Kaisen looks super damn colourful and vivid. At its absolute best, the animation is some of the most fluid I've ever seen, genuinely. The fight scenes are for sure where it shines the most and MAPPA make the most out of each and every frame, making every millisecond of this show look insanely good, they really do flex hard on us whenever a fight happens. It makes me jealous that Attack on Titan didn't have the same amount of time given to it as this show did, because it still looks great but it doesn't even match up to half of what Jujutsu Kaisen's animation does - that's how damn good it is, I'm like drooling at show gorgeous this show is. JJK and Demon Slayer are really carrying new-gen shonen in terms of animation. But seriously, I think JJK now takes my top spot as the nicest looking anime I've seen - the nicest looking shonen at the very least. So I'm definitely obligated to give it high praise in at least this department, I'd be dead wrong it I didn't. I can probably pull any single frame from this show and I could find a few reasons why it looks gorgeous, MAPPA really took a lot of time and care with this show, I'm hoping they do the same in all their future projects because in terms of animation, them and Ufotable are leading the industry by a very, very long leash.
Story & Character:
While not as perfect as its animation, Jujutsu Kaisen's story and characters definitely aren't bad by any means. In fact, I've grown quite attached to everyone in this show (and it definitely does improve on both of these aspects as it goes along.) The plot is relatively simple: Jujutsu sorcerers protect the world from curses (which means cursed spirits and evil curse users) using their individual cursed energy as a weapon whether it be in the form of a technique or a cursed object. 
""Itadori Yuuji is a boy with tremendous physical strength, though he lives a completely ordinary high school life. One day, to save a classmate who has been attacked by curses, he eats the finger of Ryomen Sukuna, taking the curse into his own soul. From then on, he shares one body with Ryomen Sukuna. Guided by the most powerful of sorcerers, Gojou Satoru, Itadori is admitted to Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, an organization that fights the curses... and thus begins the heroic tale of a boy who became a curse to exorcise a curse, a life from which he could never turn back.""
That last paragraph was taken from Crunchyroll's description of the show, I felt it'd be easier than me half assing my own summary. It's very similar to Parasyte and Devilman in the way that it's essentially about someone losing control of their own body to a creature of some kind, (Parasyte=Parasites, Devilman=Amon) and in Jujutsu Kaisen's case, its Ryomen Sukuna, a legendary curse user/cursed spirit known as ""The King of Curses"" who died ages ago and his fingers had been spread around and had become cursed objects. Curses who eat these fingers gain immense power to destroy as they are now possessed by Sukuna himself who is essentially trying to revive himself through a single vessel, who ends up being Yuuji. Yuuji has a natural talent at supressing Sukuna inside himself so Gojou decides to make him Sukuna's vessel, in hopes that he can eat all of his fingers, manage to supress Sukuna enough for him to be killed, destroying the King of Curses once and for all. It's a relatively simple concept that sprawls off with great side characters that all get their own time to shine throughout the story in the different arcs and incredible conflict and fight scenes, which I've already mentioned look drop dead gorgeous.
I'm not going to really talk about individual developments here since I did little mini reviews for a lot of the episodes where I've already said it, but Jujutsu Kaisen does a great job and introducing and getting us attached to a vast cast of characters to the point where it's impressive that a 24 episode show can introduce so many people and still have each of them be somewhat more that just bland 2D slates, mostly thanks to some episodes being dedicated to single side characters, mostly during the Exchange Event Arc. I just think it does a great job at juggling this much and it still being incredibly cohesive and somehow not messy at all. And the main three as well as Gojou all get ample time to be developed and have character moments to establish who they are. The villains all fit into this category too, mostly Mahito and Sukuna who seem to be the top dogs in terms of antagonists. But side villains such as Jogo, Hanami and Death Paintings, Eso and Kechizu all get some time on screen to fight, but usually at the mercy of Gojou Satoru or Yuuji Itadori. Jujutsu Kaisen is mostly pretty simple but what makes it so good is that it takes its time with every single character and makes an effort to create some kind of emotional connection with each of them. It doesn't rush and is definitely saving more of this good shit for later seasons. It's not the best anime story I've ever seen but the attention to detail is something to admire at the very least. But I can definitely see its potential in the future too and I have the feeling it'll get really good one day. And all of this on top of how Godamn nice the show looks, it just comes out like a really damn tasty piece of cake.
Overall:
To conclude, Jujutsu Kaisen is leading the front of new-gen shonen anime at the moment, especially in terms of animation. And much like its main character Itadori, JJK shows a hell of a lot of potential for the future. With an upcoming movie to adapt the 4-chapter Volume 0 and definitely future seasons to come, I'm very eager to see what else this show has in store for us. It's extremely enjoyable and I don't think it really has a single *bad* episode. It's just a fuck ton of fun all throughout to be honest and I can see it packing some kind of emotion punch by the time it gets to its ending. The only complaints I can really come up with is that I didn't really feel much else other than ecstasy throughout the show and Sukuna kind of just dipped for a chunk of the show and I wish we could've seen just a little more of him. Other than that, it's a phenomenal show with tons of potential to be one of the best shonen ever. It's worth checking out just for Gojou's fights, they're for sure a highlight in the show, although I think my favourite one in the show is the fight against Hanami, the multiple Black Flashes being thrown just shows how much Yuuji actually has in terms of potential and also develops his character too. I could gush about Jujutsu Kaisen for hours, it's just really damn good and I hope it keeps this quality up for suture instalments, I have faith in MAPPA to do a great job. I don't even care if I'm overrating it a little, I loved JJK and I think it deserves the praise it's gotten.

                (IMO)
I have a problem with jjk anime and is that 2 of the things that are essential for an anime to be good are very mediocre.
Itadori has nothing special as a protagonist. He just is the funny and athletic guy that wants to protect others. He had a couple interesting or deep moments in where he questions his ideologies, but the come to nothing. Also, the relationships he makes feel forced and unreal.
The other point are the antagonist. In this first 24 episodes they were sooo irrelevant. 
There are a lot of 24 episodes anime in where there is plenty of time to develop antagonists
                  and make them memorable. But in JJk this doesn't happends. Mahito is the only one i found interesthing and only had a good peak.
For the rest of aspects, JJK i'ts ok. The cast is fun and interesthing. Animation and fights are really cool; and the power system has potential.
My final rating for JJk is 8,6/10. I'll be reading the manga and probably i will change my mind of the series.

                Uh-oh..! ^^;
The good: the music do be bangin', and the animation is generally good, and sometimes amazing. Some fight scenes in particular stand out quite a lot. They've got this cool epic-factor that was present in Bleach as well, where logic comes secondary to style - and boy do they have style!! I also love the dynamic camera movement!
Now for the not-so-good-stuff.. :D
I don't like the characters! ^^;
Grandpa is introduced & killed in episode 1. He's made out to be a big deal, but he really isn't. His one line is repeated over and over again, like it's meant to resonate, but it's not even
                  a good line! His death was glossed over sooo badly!
The main character is ridiculously happy-go-lucky at times to a silly degree. Then, at other times, they want to make him appear more serious, but it doesn't work for me. That said, there are some comedic moments, and they generally are funny.
His initial friends get forgotten after 1 or 2 episodes, and replaced by an edgy guy and a typical anime girl who achieves absolutely nothing (except for a random cool fight at the end). The guy is a bit of an edgelord, although when his story gets revealed at the end, it is kinda cool.
The teacher is a bit aloof, ridiculously OP with undefined powers, and conveniently absent so the other characters can do stuff. And then, a whole bunch of other forgettable tournament-necessary characters that achieve very little, one of which is a panda. Some of them worked, but most of them really didn't, no matter how cool the fights were, the stakes and characterisation were absent.
Especially the main three - they're made out to be great friends, but they never hang out or seem to clique well together or anything! Also, as usual, there isn't really any tension to speak of.
The story, it feels very haphazard. At first, it seems like it's going somewhere - but then, the main plot quickly gets forgotten, and nothing comes of it. Then, a random side story that does nothing. Then, a random tournament arc that does nothing, and so on. It feels all over the place, and yet going nowhere at the same time.
And, unfortunately, for me, I find story and characters to be very very important, which is why, anime of the year 2020 didn't do it for me. :x But maybe it will for you-?",7,CrusaderElly

                As somebody that’s been an anime fan since my early tween years, I feel like I’ve become rather bitter with age. Concepts that once excited me from shows I will now often find myself drawing comparisons to better executions of these ideas to the point where I find myself very often being a contrarian for what seems like no reason. Case in point, I tried watching Demon Slayer when the first episode aired, before any hype for the show had been built at all and was rather unimpressed by what the anime community now assures me is the second coming of anime Christ, birthed from
                  the womb of Haruhi Suzumiya after she was impregnated by the entire Osamu Tezuka. I personally find that while I will occasionally go back to shows that I had previously dropped due to the hype, I’m often disappointed by franchises that the hordes of weebs ultimately forget the moment that the next season begins, leading me to more often than not dig my head into the sand and double down on any potentially spicy takes, even for the popular shows that I do actually like.
Jujutsu Kaisen is not one of those shows. The moment I watched episode 1, back when it aired, I could tell that I was going to watch a really fun piece of shounen and put the series aside so that I could marathon it all in one sitting on a rainy day once all of the episodes had aired, and as somebody that recently finished marathoning the show, thank God I did, because Jujutsu Kaisen is one of the most consistently fun action anime that I’ve had the pleasure of watching, thanks in large part due to the insanely high quality animation that is surprisingly consistent throughout the show.
Action is one of the most popular genres when it comes to works getting adapted to animated medium’s, which is unfortunate because it’s also the one that requires the most amount of work to get right. If you want to watch cute anime girl’s doing nothing then you don’t really have to actually animate much. Just use a popular manga with some attractive character designs as the storyboard for your show, provide the characters with the appropriate lip flaps, and there you go, a perfectly serviceable “animated” show. Now, obviously this low bar for entry doesn’t mean that you can’t have insanely attractive shows where supposedly “nothing happens”, just look at most of what Kyoto Animation has made as an example, but action, unlike scenes where characters just talk shite, has a high focus on movement. A lot of fights in TV anime, even the best TV anime, sacrifice the movement in a fight or two, in order to provide really high levels of animation to the parts of the show that really deserve it. Jujutsu Kaisen, on the other hand, decided fuck it let’s make every fight look amazing because apparently Mappa realised that all the Yaoi money from Yuri on Ice and Attack on Titan wasn’t going to spend itself so they might as well put it to use here. Consistency is key when it comes to Jujutsu Kaisen’s aesthetic appeal, and this is really what impressed me the most from a visual perspective in this show.
Now, that being said, pretty visuals mean nothing if you don’t like the story that they’re being used to tell – TRUST ME, but fortunately for Jujutsu Kaisen, this also wasn’t a place where I had an issue. While the story itself wasn’t exactly anything special or new, for instance, if you replaced the word jujutsu sorcery with something generic like jutsu, or nen, or chi, or even something as blunt as magic than the synopsis suddenly starts to sound a lot more generic, this narrative was used an excuse for the show to thrust as many, insanely likable characters on the screen as possible. Every single character in this show is as likeable as they need to be, and that’s because they’re all full of personality, helped in no small part by the fact that Jujutsu Kaisen seemed to learn from My Hero Academia’s mistake of introducing way too many characters way too quickly, and rightly limited the class of the Jujutsu school to around 3 per year. This means that a closer look at characters with a cool character design will lead to viewers finding an equally cool character underneath that fits well into the show’s overall personality. This is perhaps best demonstrated by the series of shorts after each episode which helped give the side characters with little screen time in the show itself a moment to express their personality to the viewer, to the point where even a throwaway witch character that doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things still has a bunch of random knowledge revealed to the viewer by the end of the series 24 episode run time. Things like this are unnecessary and underappreciated, but add an immense amount of joy to the act of simply watching the characters on screen interact with each other in the main show.
Having characters with this much personality led to one of my personal favourite fights I’ve seen from a Shonen in recent years, where Yuji and Todo ended up fighting Hanami. This fight has one clear purpose within the narrative, and that’s to establish a friendship with Yuji and Todo. Yuji’s generically shounen, happy go lucky nature and Todo’s brutish, simple personality are a match that are clearly meant to either be used for a friendship or a rivalry, best demonstrated in how prior to the two taking on the special grade cursed spirit, they were fighting each other. While talking in this fight, the show was able to establish one simple fact, that Todo views Yuji as a friend, and wants to help mentor him so that he can get stronger. So obviously, when the two are fighting Hanami, that is what they do. And then the show does that.
As simple as that explanation sounds, having this major shift in how the characters interact with each other take place while the two are engaged in a serious battle, helped provide weight to a new character dynamic that was established instantly, instead of developed over the course of an arc or two, as these events often are. Hearing the pair referring to each other by ‘My Besto Friendo’ provided genuine hype to the fight, but more than that, the fight provided genuine weight to their friendship. This fight is a perfect showcase of how action can be used to develop a story, instead of a story being used to provide action, and I for one, view this as a great sign for things to come.
Unfortunately, I don’t think that the show is perfect, and while my main criticism for the show is something that I personally only consider as a nit-pick for this season, it is not a good sign for things to come, and it is something that I am genuinely worried about with regards to any potential future instalments in this franchise. And that’s the fact that the villains never die. Every time they’re about to be defeated once and for all, the show provides a bullshit asspull as to why they were able to get away, which is fine for establishing them as villains, who maybe weren’t revealing everything that they had up their sleave, but by the end of the last episode it really got on my nerves. There’s a different between a character that can’t die and one that won’t die. A character that can’t die, no matter how much the heroes throw at them is a genuine threat to be wary of. A character that won’t die, because the writer doesn’t want to kill them off yet is annoying because it halts any potential progress in the show’s story, in a cheap and annoying way, especially if the hero had already beaten them in the fight.
Whether this is just a nit-pick or a sign of things to come is something that I’ll have to wait and see about as a beta male anime-only viewer, but as somebody that rarely has an opinion that coincides with popular consensus in the anime community let me just say believe the hype.

This show got me hooked up and I just love it, its animation, thanks to Mappa, is god tier. The soundtrack is also good in this anime. The concept of cursed energy is insane and hats off to the imagination and creativity. 
Finally, we have a villain like Sukuna who doesn't want to cooperate with his vessel or the body which he has occupied and is true evil. The voice acting of Sukuna is amazing and one of a kind.
This series has a great mix of thrill with comedy which is a treat to watch. The opening and closing of this anime

                Ah so you heard about a new Shounen genre anime, and everyone on TikTok is talking about Demon Slayer and AOT. You might as well take a seat for 24 episodes of something you are VERY familiar with (thanks BLEACH) and enjoy yourself. 
I will start right off by saying the cool fights are what carries this show. It is refreshing to see LESS fan service and women just being damn cool. Fights aren't blocky, and not every character is drawn ""pretty"". (I'm looking right at you AOT)
This show can go one of two ways depending on a lot of things. It COULD very well
                  drag on like BLEACH did for 16 seasons. Personally, I am hoping it does, but it does without ANY filler arcs.

                JJK does what Shonens are supposed to do. They give you that enticing action with a nice story as a chaser.
*light spoilers (episodes 1-3)
 I'm glad that they strayed away from a Naruto clone and opted for a more realistic main character. Yuji can't and wont be able to save everyone and instead of getting a friendship boost he accepts that truth and learns to live with it. They also avoided defining his life by his grandfather's words by devoting half of a episode to breaking away from those thoughts. He doesn't feel over powered and avoids letting Sukuna at all cost. I thoroughly enjoyed
                  the walking pace that the show had regarding the back story of characters. They didn't rush to tell you everyone's history rather they let it come up naturally and didn't let flashbacks overstay their welcome. Overall there isn't much to hate about this show. I could sit here and nit pick but what's the point in doing that.

                This review is from someone who has never read the manga. I feel like the anime expected the viewers to already know and understand about the Jujutsu world. I rewinded the anime quite a few times cause I don’t really understand the plotline and the terms (cursed techniques, cursed energy, domain expansion, etc) are so confusing and badly explained.
I actually had to stop my watching and googled these ‘cursed’ terms so I can have a better understanding. I also think the characters’ build up are subpar but I don’t really mind on this cause it’s still just the first season. So yeah, might actually read

                For the record there is nothing wrong with jiu-jitsu Kaizen, it's actually a fine Shonen battle series. I definitely see the appeal, and it deserves all the praise it gets, especially compared to its contemporaries. This review is to quantify the reasons I felt the show was not great. So if I don't mention it from this point onwards it is safe to assume I thought those aspects of this show were good and of  quality with its peers.
My first issue with this show is I cannot relate to any of the characters. I'm a 42 year old alpha male. High School's a long
                  time ago and I hated it there. I find none of these characters remotely interesting or relatable until Kento Nanami is introduced.
My second issue with this show is despite all the supernatural powers on display, there's far too much emphasis on just hand to hand combat, punches and kicks being thrown. That's why after nanami was introduced my interest in the show increased because there were characters who had powers that differed from nearly punching and kicking stronger and faster.
This next issue stems from the previous one. The fact that our primary Heroes rely mostly on their fists, palms and kicks to win through the day, despite the fact that the villains have supernatural abilities which seems lopsided. Like I can project poisonous feathers that attack from the sky yet I can't defeat a kid who can only run and punch me in the face?
And there is no world-building to explain any of this. You were given some vague descriptions about how cursed energy works, how there are those who can use it, those who can't and that there are cursed objects with magical powers in them but literally that is it. There is no explanation to any Rhyme or Reason behind any of the random differences in powers, limitations and abilities.
Not to go too much into it, but I also feel this show has bad comedic timing
Like I said in the beginning I like the action sequences, I liked the character design, I like the overall story that the anime is trying to tell. I like everything about this anime except what I critiqued above. It is entertaining to watch. But it didn't secure a place in my heart.

Jujutsu Kaisen has the potential to be a modern classic. In all ways, this show exceeded expectations and tackled topics that many animes are afraid to approach. It has amazing fight scenes and an incredible art style accompanied by an enjoyable soundtrack.
What made this show wonderful above all, though, were the characters. I often found myself deeply surprised and touched by the words they said. The main 3 (Nobara, Megumi, and Itadori) all had profound things to say about their places in life. Nobara, with feminism and her role as a female sorcerer. Megumi, with his wayward familial history and hidden potential. Itadori, with
                  his focus on the value of human life and how actions affect others. All of them were so lovable.

The overall plot is very simple, but it's the story arcs that focus on specific characters that add flavor to this show. I like almost all of the characters, tho they are not flawlessly written. Some of the characters are so OP that they have to make excuses about their absence in a fight. The fighting animation is great, a good blend of both 2d and 3d animations. It is also faithful to the art style of
                  the manga. The soundtrack did not work for me. It was mediocre at best with only one great song.

                My friends have been bugging me none stop to watch this and I'm happy to say it didn't disappoint! Halfway through the first episode I knew I was going to like this show a lot and now that I've finished it, I can safely say I was right. It's now one of my favorite shounen anime out there. Here's why: 
1. I love the female characters. I was afraid when I saw the two boys one girl dynamic that Nobara was going to get the Sakura treatment but she didn't. She was crazy and silly just like the main character which isn't something I see
                  often in anime. More often than not, the female characters in media are serious to counterbalance the wild male protagonist. But she was just as dorky and silly as Yuji and I liked that. I also liked the other female characters in the show. They had their own motivations and ideals. They could hold their own in a fight. They never had to be saved. In fact, they did a lot of the saving in more than one fight. Are they perfect? No. But they're pretty dope none the less. 
2. The show is a lot sillier than I thought it would be. From the screenshots and gifs I've seen, I thought it would be a serious shounen but the slapstick comedy and pop culture references (I watched it dubbed) weren't something I was expecting. The show is good for a laugh in a way that reminds me of FMA:B. I really like the sudden funny moments that offset the tension. 
3. I also love the use of weapons in the show. Maki's glasses allow her to see cursed spirits. Nobara's hammer and nails. The blood arrows. The way the world's magic system works (the cursed objects, spirits, etc) is really engaging and I think that it's a fun newer way of showing the world off through the character's everyday tools. Everyone has their own weapon and fighting styles. 
I could keep going but I think this is enough to show how much I liked the anime. If I had any critique it would be that the ending fell a little flat. It was just suddenly over. But I'm sure that it'll be fine once season 2 comes out! I recommend this anime to everyone who's read this far into this review!",9,OtakuInku

                Jujutsu Kaisen is the newest shounen from this season and how good is it truly you may ask? Its good, but overhyped way to much for what this anime has to offer. Most shounen shows in general are pretty well, not that good but at least I am happy that this show is one of the better shounen. In a nutshell this anime is Demon Slayer but better. No poor writing or worldbuilding tough it does suffer a few problems just like my English.

Story-
The story of jujutsu kaisen is kinda fast paced but maybe not to fast. The story has
                  alot to offer but the idea isnt the most original but the way they exucute it is done very well. The power system in the world is dark energy, thats an unique idea and that is always welcome. This show does include filler-episodes and comendy and that kinda makes the show a bit worse but not by a lot. The first 10 episodes of Jjk are mostly refreshing and are slow paced in my opinion. This is good because then the anime could establish the characters, the world and the story. But later episodes are a bit faster paced and I dont know how to feel about those. The worldbuilding in this anime is promising and isnt all to bad but one thing what is in my opinion holding back this anime is the comendy. This anime suffers the same problems as demon slayer because first some one getts brutally murderd and the next scene the mc and sidechracters make funny faces and stupid jokes that dont fit the tone well of the anime. And the jokes in general arent good or funny in any kind of sense. I think that I like smiled once when they talked about a woman with a big butt, it was unexpecting but it was pretty good. But later the comendy isnt really that funny. The backstories in this show were pretty good but nothing like mindblowing, I do think that the last episodes kinda went downhill but hey thats my opinion. The explenation they gave us in the anime is good and makes everything verry clear, I also like anime that are dark just like this one and thats the reason why I just dont like the comendy, to be honest. I think the story of jjk is exucuted well tough It does have few mistakes but that doesnt really mean that it is bad.
Characters-
I think this part is prolly the worst part of the show, not because I hate it but all the other parts of this show are really good and I will tell you why....
Itadori-
He is fun mc tough I wont really call him special or refreshing. If were mostly looking at his point of view and that cool so we can be suprised as him if something unexpected happend. But as I said. He isnt really the best protaganist because I dont truly care what happens to him or anything. I do like him demon side a bit more but thats all I have to say.
Megumi-
He is an okay side character tough I just dont have a lot to say about him. He isnt really well written in the story and thats kinda a shame because he belongs in the main trio of the anime.
Kugisaki-
I am happy that she isnt fan service but she does suffer the same problem as Megumi, she doesnt have a lot of development and that kind makes her an okay character. It isnt that I like her its just that I dont she is well written.
Satoru-
He is one of the best characters in the show and there is a reason why. First he is hot and second, every time he is on screen its always fun to watch and cool. I think that he has one of the coolest abilities in the anime and he is also verry stylish. I just like him, thats all.
Todo-
He is the man we all want as a friend, he is the only comic relief character in this hshow that is done right. I like him because of personality and design and becuase we have the same taste in women. He is pretty much the most fun character in the show.
Panda-
Pretty cool character, doesnt add alot to the story but he isnt the worst character in the show. He does look like some one.......
Jogo-
He didnt have a big impression on me but that doesnt mean I didnt like his power.
Mahito-
He is probally the meansest character in the show and maybe also the one who forms the biggest thread beside sakuna, he did leave some sort of impression but I have to see more of him to call him a well or poorly written villain.
These were all characters that had some impact in the story and how I tought about them. I do think they need more development but this anime has 24 episodes so I dont blame them for a cast this big. But hey I do like most characters dont worry.
Sound-
The first Op and Ed were bangers, lets be real. The second Op was intresseting but wasnt as impactfull and the second ending made me feel sad so I think that Manga readers know something, please dont spoil.
Art/Animation-
Wow, MAPPA has done it again, it looks amazing and the animation is so fluid. No wonder why Aot fans are so Salty. Kinda sad. But dont blame Mappa, blame the shitty comitte.
Enjoyment-
I really liked this show a lot, even tough it had flaws I do think what it had to iffer was amazing, I hope season 2 will be as good or maybe even better idk. I liked it a lot. But, this isnt my favorite anime of the season. That goes to a other anime. Still 3rd favorite anime of this season. This is all bye...

                Obsessed! I love jujutsu kaisen so much! The story follows the typical shone style of short missions in between big battles against monsters that just seem to get stronger and stronger. While sometimes this is a hit or miss, JJK also has the overarching plot of Itadori and the growth of Sukuna within him. This slowly develops throughout the show while he also improves alongside his classmates. The possibilities to what can happen are almost unpredictable so you are always on edge and push ahead. The story tied to the incredible animation makes JJK addicting to watch. Definitely one of the most well-done shows in
                  a while and I hope the quality only continues to improve over time.",10,kurapikamisa

                A surprisingly good shounen show.
I was very late to the hype to this anime as I like for a show to finish before I attempt to see it. I heard a friend talk about how this is kind of like a parody of the shounen trope, I whole heartedly disagree with that statement after binge watching it. Instead of a parody of shounen, I would say this takes the most intresting aspects of shounen from other shows and combines it into (IMO) one of the most perfect SHOUNEN anime out there. 
Pros: 
Interesting character design and backstory.
Takes many good aspects from other shounen anime like
                  HxH, Bleach, Yu Yu Hakusho.
Amazing animation
Good comedy relief
Finally a good strong female lead (unlike a certain pink hair shinobi).
Cons:
Itadori's terrible hero complex(though I see growth in that).
Cringy dialogue kinda.......
Lack of any uniqueness but does everything that makes a shounen really well(Personal complaint not really a con).",8,Mosu69
40748,"
                It is very entertaining to watch but not the best thing out there. The characters are amazing and the animation is very top tier which is why I gave it a rating of 8. When I just started the anime, it was kinda confusing how fast the first episode was going to get to the story but it worked itself out. If you enjoyed Demon Slayer, I think this will work best for you. Can't wait to see the final episode of the season! I am only on ep 10 while writing this so it might be a way earlier review, but I think it's
                  good enough to talk about. Also, just in case I drop it which is a possibility if nothing happens more in the story.",8,Voxuid
40748,"
                Shonen anime are always a double-edged sword: they can be awesome and keep you hyped and interested in the story, or end up falling for the same cliché tropes and stories. 
I'm glad to say that Jujutsu Kaisen is a fresh take on shonen, much different from the other mainstream ones. It takes on after Yuuji eats a special-grade cursed object to save the sorcerer fighting for it. After that, Yuuji takes in a powerful curse, Sukuna, and learns to control it. 
I really like the characters, and I think they're all very unique and creative. I mean, we got a huge talking ""panda"", a
                  guy that only says salmon roll ingredients, two super strong and developed (!!) female characters, a likable main character who's strong, but not cocky about it. I loved every single one of them and I'm expecting to see more, especially from Inumaki and Maki. 
Besides the characters, I think that what made this anime interesting was the continuous hype about it. Even in the simpler episodes, Jujutsu Kaisen kept being interesting by adding great and funny dialogue and amazing fight scenes. Most of the show relies on its characters, which was a great idea, since all of them are great. 
Also, help, I can't stop listening to lost in paradise.",9,acidycat
40748,"
                     Starting off with what I love about it. This animes unique plot and premise told me it was gonna be the one. The concept that peoples negative emotions will manifest monsters reflecting those negative thoughts is a cool premise that i absolutely love. The magic system established also synchronizes really well with said premise. Right now the story seems a little one dimensional, and streamlined, but it seems like it is expanding, and becoming more and more intrinsic as it goes along, and the pacing is nice and consistent. Can't wait to see how the story, and itadori progresses throughout
                  it. 
     Now for the art: The art, especially in the OP, is borderline orgasmic to look at, the bright, and vibrant colors really causes every little inch of the screen to pop out in its own unique way, amazing direction in both of the OP's, not to mention the fight scenes are really well choreographed, and you can consistently tell what's happening throughout the entire fight
     Next is the sound: The music in both of the OP's, especially the newest one."" makes me want to watch the op OVER AND OVER again. it does such a good job at encapsulating you into the show, and getting hyped for the start. the background music is pretty unnoticeable to me besides for the hype parts. So its ok
     The characters: I have not fallen in love with a main character like this in a while, he reminds me of a younger, more mature version of Naruto when that show comes out. Its interesting to see his type of character, that's kind of carefree, yet serious at the same time, play out in these sometimes comedic, sometimes intense situations. Not to mention, the supporting cast, like gojou, are characters I've actually come to care about, and I'm so invested in all of their backstories, and motivations for becoming a sorcerer
     My enjoyment: It's safe to say that my enjoyment is immense with a show like this, even if you aren't that interested in the story, the fight scenes are well animated enough to keep you hooked based off that alone, my enjoyment here couldn't be topped
     Overall: Its a solid anime, with little flaws to notice. and its rewatchability is there for anyone who loves its amazing animations, endearing characters, and explicit fight scenes. A solid 9/10 anime",9,mr_anythang
40748,"
                Let's get the obvious out of the way: this is a battle shonen.  So we're not going to expect a broader plot a la FMA or AOT or anything like that.  The show is going to develop a stable of characters with unique powers and quirks and throw them against villains and each other like an 8 year old with action figures.
Within those confines, Jujutsu far and away outstrips anything I've seen recently.  I've handily found more enjoyment in the first 19 episodes than in an equivalent amount of Demon Slayer eps as well as the entirety of My Hero Academia. 
                  What does Jujutsu do so much better than others?
Animation: Simple enough- Mappa kills it here.  The OPs are beautiful and the action scenes are all well-animated.  Probably ties with Demon Slayer here, but that's the last tie we're going to see.
Characters/Comedy: This is subjective, but Jujutsu makes me laugh more than any other shonen I've seen.  Itadori is the goofy kind of character that naturally allows for a lot of good gags, but on top of that, the end-of-episode ""Juju Strolls"" can be sublimely weird.  The whole cast is interesting and likable, though, with no cringe and plenty of well-drawn backstory.  The mangaka just has a random, screwball sense of humor that I quite enjoy.
Plotting/Subversion of expectation:  This is a big one.  Plotting in shonen battle animes can feel very cookie-cutter.  You generally know where the story is going, with well-established stakes signposting upcoming plot points + the experience of previous shonen shows doing the same darn thing.  Jujutsu legitimately feels different.  To call out specific examples would spoil them, but the show has legit left my jaw on the floor multiple times with the way it has trodden over established tropes and betrayed this viewer's expectations.  On the surface, it's a standard shonen, but moment to moment, this is a very clever show.
So yeah, legit excited for a season 2.  And since it sounds like the manga has a little more lore, I look forward to reading through it as a refresher before S2 (and I'm usually a dirty anime-only watcher...this is good enough to make an exception.)",10,chrysalis83
40748,"
                Honestly, Jujutsu Kaisen is your pretty basic shonen. The actual story itself doesn't do anything spectacular - we follow a bunch of Jujutsu sorcerers as they run around defeating cursed spirits, with a larger group of cursed spirits lurking in the background and generally wreaking havoc. Itadori is your pretty basic protagonist as well - he eats Sukuna's finger and becomes his vessel, hated by everyone and stupidly powerful at times (remind you of Naruto anyone? You even have the basic three-man team with a teacher set-up). 
The whole thing feels like an amalgamation of a lot of different, popular shonen only slightly shaken up
                  and with some pretty cool animated fight scenes, and honestly sometimes you just need that. I still had a lot of fun with this and there were some pretty great one-liners in the show as well even if some lines/comedic elements could get a little cringy at times. 
Also, my dreams are strange and I had a weird one about Megumi/Sukuna, so now I guess I'm suckered into watching this because that is forever scarred into my brain. Add in what I've heard about the Shibuya arc, and I definitely can't wait for what the next season will bring. Not everything has to be a masterpiece - and whilst Jujutsu Kaisen definitely wasn't in my eyes, it was still a ton of fun and I'm glad I finally dived into watching this.",8,meg_lowde

                Jujutsu Kaisen is truly shounen at it's peak, it takes inflluence from it's predecesors and refines the formula perfectly. After rewatching this season, i have to say this might be one of, if not the best anime adaptation we've had in a while. MAPPA knocked it out the park with this one and as a manga reader I couldn't be happier with how they portrayed everything.
I've seen many say the story of JJK is it's weakest aspect and while that may be somewhat true for now, trust me when i say it gets real in future arcs. There's a lot of subtle foreshadowing throughout this
                  entire season which will play a huge role in future arcs and not to mention with most shounen the story isn't always the most engaging part at first but through more seasons it gets fleshed out as it should and this is the same case with JJK.
Now my favourite part of JJK the characters, JJK has such an engaging and unique set of characters who are always interesting to watch. The interactions between characters, especially the main trio is one of the my favourite dymamics of the series. Of course I can't go without mentioning the one and only Gojo Satoru, the strongest sorcerer in the show. His laid back yet chilling personaility is such contrast and is so interesting to see. The side characters are all amazing and fleshed out with their own idealogoies which never feel overbearning and are always fresh to see. 
Sound and Art were literally perfect, the animation was so fluid and crisp. MAPPA did not have to go that hard with the animation, seriously my jaw was wide open so many times with how gorgeous the scenes were. The OST for Jujutsu Kaisen was so amazing literally one of the best soundtracks i've heard in a while. Props to the composers because this OST is gonna be on repeat when it gets released.
Overall, Jujutsu Kaisen was some of the most fun i've had watching anime it was one of my highlights of every week. I'm gonna miss JJK Fridays so much but we do have a movie announced for Volume 0 which i'm so hyped for, YUTA best boy let's goo. But i'm so grateful to MAPPA for giving us this amazing adaptation. I couldn't have asked for more and I hope they continue working on JJK for season 2. If MAPPA can give us the same quality or possibly one up themselves the shibuya incident arc will actually break the internet and i couldn't be more exicted for the future of the series.",10,saltyanpan

FOR THOSE WHO LOVE DEMON-THEMED ANIME, OP CHARACTERS, STRONG AND INDEPENDENT WOMEN CHARACTERS, I RECOMMEND YOU WATCH THIS.
Review point:
↠ The story is great and had a great plot but it was too hyped so I expect too much to the story and got a little disappointed. There are episodes that make me want to drop the anime.↠ The animation is 10/10. It is a masterpiece. MAPPA did great, especially for the fighting scenes. It has a satisfying and pleasing animation.
↠ I love the characters. The female characters are strong and independent characters. I love how they all have different beliefs. The antagonists are good, too.
↠ The VAs are great. I think they are very accurate. The music tracks are the best. All of the music used is a masterpiece.

                This is one of those times I did not understand the hype behind this anime. Yeah, there is a lot I enjoy and during the first 11 or so episodes I would have considered giving this an 8. But to me, this show is just ok. The characters are honestly unlikeable, except for my man Satoru Gojō. The story feels a little too monster of the week and then all of a sudden in turns into a tournament arc. Sorry it just was not for me. 
The most redeeming part of this anime is the Art and Music. Both of which are amazing. As everyone
                  knows the OP is a bop and Mappa did an amazing job animating the fights of this show. Maybe I will re-watch this show in a few years and change my mind, but as for right now, I think Jujutsu Kaisen is just ok.",7,ZacPatz

                A great anime with a very good plot and amazing characters... Honestly, I gave this anime a 10 just because of the intense fights that happened.

I had enjoyed watching this anime and continuing watching weekly for more masterpiece content.

                I feel like I have more negative to say about this than positive but I'll start with the positives first. The character's were really likeable, in my opinion, and I thought the fight scenes were great. However, I don't think that it's very original. The premise is that he has apart of him that came from the enemy and they have to work together sometimes as it is strong at fighting its own kind (Parasyte). Then they give him a trial at which he will help them as long as he helps defeat the enemy (which is part of what he is too) but He'll
                  be under direct protection of the best/strongest person they have (Attack on Titan) and then there's an arc where all the students go into a forest to prove themselves by fighting and they end up running into a powerful enemy that they have to try and defeat (Demon Slayer). As I said, I did enjoy it, it just didn't seem too original to me.",8,Scary-Milky
40748,"
                Jujutsu Kaisen doesnt have the best story of all anime but its pretty ok thats because i gave it a 7.
But the Artstyle, the animation, sound and most important the characters made this anime one of the best.
I mean I didnt even skipped the first OP of JJK in any episode because of the mixture they made with the songs and the animation.
I think the reason why so many people love jujutsu Kaisen is because of Satoru Gojo and Sukuna. Everyone who watched the series know that when one of them appears at the screnn its the absolute Prime Time of the episode.
One other reason
                  might be that its really just like Naruto but I'm sorry Guys I didnt watch Naruto as a Kid i started the series a year ago so it got a more worse rate than JJK. I mean i was in the Perfect age to see it as a kid but for some reason i didnt. 
Anyway its remembering me of Naruto too and thats another reason this anime is higher ranked. 
Its a 9/10 overall because the story is not the most original one. btw sorry for the bad english im from Germany :3",9,Xenovilla

                JJK season 1 only (Unpopular Opinion)
It's a good anime, but it's definitely overrated and overhyped. It is this year's Kimetsu.
I think it's generic Shounen anime (which doesn't mean bad). You know for one punch man and Kimetsu I could understand what the fuss was about, but I couldn't with JJK. It was just another anime for me, not something special (not bad though)
For the characters, I liked Gojou, he was interesting.
The art and the animation were goodIn the beginning I think the pace was very quick which is very good. The anime doesn't want to waste time.
I don't know, I'm not gonna lie, it's enjoyable, and I can see it has a lot of potential and I can see it gets a lot better (and I hear the manga has a lot more and better arcs to offer). I think if they ended the anime with the arc when the villains are trying to neutralize or seal Gojou it would be a lot better... I kept waiting 31st of October but it just wouldn't come 😂
I think the final episodes were anticlimactic (Unpopular opinion)
I mean don't get me wrong there were amazing episodes
The the power balance/system was messy in my opinion
But I think it's just another anime carried by it's good adaptation

I give it 7 - 7.5/10",7,Asura_Pendragon

                I usually don't bother writing reviews, but after watching the last episode of the first Jujutsu Kaisen season, I'm still so pumped with adrenaline that I have to get rid of some energy.
I really thought a lot about every aspect that is being rated but I cannot change the fact that everything is a 10 for me. 
The story is extremely catchy - it's not too complex, but still unique which in my opinion is perfect for a shounen anime. I really like the curse topic and Itadori's conflict, it's appealing af. Additionally, I love how the relationship between the main roles and their sensei
                  goes. It feels realistic and relatable and I get the feeling that a lot of thought was put in there.
The art is marvellous. Not only does the anime keep the already lit artstyle from the manga, but it mixes this with stunning animations which make every single fight straight eye candy. Combined with a bombastic, arrousing soundtrack that connects genres like rock/metal with pumped up electro beats it simply blows you away. The episode that imo displays this the most is the 24th. Also noteworthy are the awesomely cut openings, which push my adrenaline level to 200% each time before the episode even starts. :p

                Uh, my first review. great. But here today, i wanted to talk about an anime that had me on the edge of my seat, which you already know is JUJUTSU KAISEN.  This work of art is outstanding to see, and it's really becoming peak shonen (at least for new gens.)
I personally take enjoyment over writing. I'm all for plot and fights. And Jujutsu Kaisen mixes both of them in an amazing way. But first off..
THE PLOT:
I feel like it has amazing potential (let's wait for second season to come) and it really has to go to the characters (specifically villains). They encompass so much
                  of what's happening and could happen, that it's genuinely more intriguing than usual. It looks like it's going to go slow and when everything happens (again, in the second season), it'll burst as much energy as it can. That was just an assumption, anything can happen.
THE CHARACTERS (main characters/protagonist's side)
The MCs and supporting charactes are honestly going great to be honest. Itadori is just brimming with potential yet to be used. We've already seen glimpses (what he said in episode 1) and it's just starting. Fushiguro, I feel like he had already developed a lot in the past, but if his character goes beyond, he'll be an OUTSTANDING side character, maybe top 5 new gen. And I don't have much to say about Nobara, so tell me if I'm missing anything.Justice to the supporting characters was already done during the exams.
THE FIGHTS:
Immaculate. Some of the best choreography I've seen in anime. MAPPA has done a great job in this field.
and thats it. Thanks for seeing it, this is my first review so not perfect, hell I wont be surpised if its called bad. I might not do as much reviews, as i said its enjoyment over writing for me. hope you liked it.",10,theanimearchon

                Jujutsu Kaisen Review
Story (9/10) Great 
The story in Jujutsu Kaisen I think is great. I can after some time tell that a lot of foreshadowing and thought from the mangaka had been placed within the plot and story moving forward. Majority of it that will fly over most and even my own head because we aren't aware as to what exactly it's foreshadowing to or hinting at but the presence of it all definitely exist, is appreciated and is well done in regards to the quality of the setup portion of it all. The world of Jujutsu kaisen is also a very intricate one as
                  a lot it's supernatural lore you can tell is well thought out of ahead of time and is placed in many situations that the story uses in a very compelling and unique way. I don't necessarily want to dive into examples but if you've watched the anime, I'd say it's hard to deny the quality of all especially in comparison to it's competitor shonen battle orientated anime. Although it is very unique and different nothing within it currently right now I think was anything inherently exceptionally mindblowing to me. But it doesn't change the fact that it was was all just very great setup for it is to come in on all fronts.  
Art and Animation (10/10) Masterpiece
The art style in particular I felt it was something that was very unique and how the animation at times to flowed like water in certain scenes is something I can say in it's own right was outstanding from start to finish. 
Sound (10/10) Outstanding 
It didn't matter if it was the openings, endings, info dumps, laid back or fight scenes the music was always something in this show that complimented and even enhanced every scene. I started off watching in sub and moved over to the dub and on both fronts the voice actors for all of the characters sounded fitting and spot on. The sound effects on all of the blows, unique techniques and explosions were all outstanding.
Characters (9/10) Great
The characters in Jujust Kaisen I thought were for the most part great. At first, the first few episodes I honestly didn't and couldn't care less for any of the main characters especially Nobara who I for one at first just genuinely just didn't like. But all that showcased after watching the entire thing is the potential and area of growth they can have on all fronts in regards to character development. Itadori Yuuji for example I didn't care for his reasons for doing the things he did at the start but the anime via other characters quickly gave him a reality check and it hardened his resolved and reasoning behind his actions far more than just doing it for his passing relative. Megumi Fushiguro was one character at first who was in my opinion hard to get a read on, he was always some who was showcased as the ""indifferent one"", majority of everything he said during the first quart of this season or so just came off with as a nonchalant type of attitude, fake deep and something I didn't really care for. But when the battles started and you watch him struggle and push forward, this was when I truly started to see the character behind it all, showcasing resolve hard as rock regardless if he was winning or losing the particular fight. His backstory also at the end of the season was also great characterization that made me further appreciate him more and he probably became my favorite in the anime. Nobara Kugisaki like I stated earlier out of the main three was someone at the start and honestly for the majority of the season I just did not like the least bit. She always gave off a bitchy and cocky attitude and when it came time to back it up it never felt satisfying to me personally with how it was handled or even how she dealt with the situation, even when it came to the resolve and growth within the character it felt like she was one that I didn't really feel grew a satisfying amount enough for me to care or be impressed with anything she did. A lot of her training was quickly shown on the side as a joke or not fully dived into. I didn't care for anything she did until the last fight of the season to be honest which was great but that was at the very end. Hopefully she has more growth, better moments, deeper characterization and/or character development moving forward because out of the three main character she just felt like she was just not on the level in those categories as the other two, for me it was almost never an enjoyable time when she was one screen obnoxiously bitching and not being able to back it up, maybe I'm just not a fan of this character architype and there's nothing wrong with her and showing off the difference in the main three and how they all handle is different is the variety that should be complemented on. If that is the case then it is what it is and I'm willing to admit it and I'll leave it at that and fall back. Satoru Gojou is the epitome of heat and that's all there is needed to be said about him. Moving on to the side characters, standout ones for me Aoi Toudou, Panda and Sukuna Ryoumen. I wouldn't go into detail as this section is already quite long but the anime did a great job with majority of the characters in the anime and I'll leave it at there.  
Enjoyment (8/10) Very Good
More Specifically (8.25/10) Very Good
My enjoyment fluctuated around the start and I think it had to do more so with the depth the series goes into quite earlier on. I stated watching in sub and I'll admit I'm a slow reader so when these info dump sections would start and the amount of dialogue that would take place and quickly be on the subtitle section and be removed wasn't something that was an enjoyable way to consume. It did force me more so often than I'd like to admit to have to pause it to not only read the subtitles that were up there very quickly but also the visual representation that the info dump section would be referring to as well all were required to be consumed at a pace I felt for me personally was far to quick not to have to pause it and digest everything that was being presented to me before moving on. In manga format I feel this is perfectly fine but I personally didn't think is translated perfectly well in anime format. This is initially made the anime for me more so a bit more taxing than enjoyable to consume. Intriguing and unique nonetheless but not an enjoyable method from a presentation standpoint at the current pace I felt it was at with the combination of the very face pace and lengthy subtitle dialogue to go hand and hand with it. This is when I decided to switch over to the dub which I felt a decent amount of this issue was alleviated for me. At that point I could use my ears to consume what was being vocally said while paying attention to the visual presentation of the lore, the super natural rules of it all and most importantly the beautiful artstyle and animation.  
I felt Jujustu Kaisen for me had a somewhat of a rough start. And I did take far longer than normal to complete it. I only watched it when I felt completely and mentally up for it and didn't want to force myself to watch it if I wasn't 100% in that mental state because then I felt I wouldn't have been able to enjoy it as much as I wanted to because of any personal vibe I was mentally in. That meant anytime I was ready to sit down and consume a episode or 2 there was an abundance to it as well, no rush and I do felt for me and this series it only helped that I did take my time instead of consuming it day one for the sake of ""being caught up with the cool cats"".
Overall (9/10) Great
More Specifically (9.25/10) Great
Jujustu Kaisen is a great anime. That one saying that state's ""Easy to play hard to master"" and I think Jujustu Kaisen is that in manga/anime format. The art style, animation and music all together make for an easy to get into type of anime for all. But the understanding all the plots, setup and supernatural power system that this series has going on in full detail (especially if you're an anime only like myself) is something I can't say is easy to grasp all entirely in one go and that's not a bad thing. All that means is the series does require more from it's audience which isn't really something that is seen that much in the shonen anime these days since in my opinion nen from Hunter X Hunter which was something that was praise for the exact same thing but most people who still can't fully explain it to you. Jujustu Kaisen is definitely one of the best shonen anime to have aired in a very long time and I recommend it on all front.",9,Rikuson1

I will try keep this review short because by now we know what happens main character gets superpowers because his brave or stupid and that power needs to be controlled and he needs to control it...time skip etc.
now that is out of the way for the new fans this will be an amazing watch for people who have been watching anime for a long time same old, but it is enjoyable it is well written. The comedy is done well some moments I did burst out laughing.
The story is okay and decent, but the one thing MAPPA went beyond was
                  the Art it was really incredible. the best parts are the battles you will be left wanting more.

                This Anime shined in its character interactions, and comedy surprisingly. The fight scenes were also pretty decent with a few gems sprinkled here or there. The major problem I have with this anime is its lost potential. Itadori punches his way through enemies with help from Sukuna rarely. It leaves the viewer craving for Sukuna to come out and kick some... Well you know what I mean. But he only shows himself on quite literally a few occasions. It left me majorly disappointed. Some of the characters were dull and one sided. The fact that Itadori pretty much only punches and kicks his enemies gets
                  pretty boring after a while. The last episode of the season was also a boring letdown with antagonists the average viewer couldn't care less about. Overall, I expected more from Jujutsu Kaisen. Who knows, maybe next season they could hammer out a few of these issues.",7,LEGOmyEGGOdude
40748,"
                I didn't expect to like Jujutsu Kaisen as much as I did.  I saw the hype it was getting, and expected it to be like My Hero Academia or Demon Slayer.  I enjoy those shows, but I can see their flaws and wouldn't rate them as masterpieces.  I wouldn't say everything about Jujutsu Kaisen is a masterpiece, but heck it was just so exciting and fun, and that has to be taken into account when rating a show.  
Story 9
The story moves fast and it's kind of amazing how much was packed into this season.  A fast pace isn't always
                  a good thing for a show, but it definitely worked for Jujutsu Kaisen.  I won't outline the plot or give a synopsis, since other reviewers have done a good job of that.  I will say that I love how the worldbuilding of curses and sorcerers is based on Japanese mythology and superstitions.  The family structures of the main sorcery clans and rank system reminded me of hierarchies in Japanese cultural institutions.  I'm a big fan of anime that pay homage to Japanese culture, so I loved this aspect.  
Art 10
The art was absolutely stunning.  Fight scenes were so crisp and fast-paced, and the character designs were so detailed and gorgeous.  
Sound 10
Both Kaikai Kitan and Vivid Vice are legendary openings that foreshadow events in the show in all the right places, and are just amazing songs on their own.  Lost in Paradise is one of the best endings I've ever seen.  For a show that's full of darkness, having a fun dance break with modern Tokyo vibes was a great move.  The second ending wasn't bad, but it also wasn't very memorable. 
The OST was amazing, and after months of listening to covers, I can't wait for the official release.  The soundtracks built so much hype for fight scenes and showdowns.  
Character 9
Every character in Jujutsu Kaisen is a badass and it's a ton of fun.  Itadori Yuuji, while having some classic shounen optimism and compassion for his opponents, is a good protagonist who's adapting to his new situation.  Fushiguro Megumi is a cool character with an awesome technique and plays several important roles in the series.  But let's talk about the third member of our trio: Kugisaki Nobara.  She's the female of the group and a strong female character who is combative and aggressive while being unapologetically girly with a fondness for shopping.  Her expressions are fierce and she is beautiful without being a subject of fanservice.  Her fighting style is forceful, using a hammer and nails, and isn't something you would usually see for a female character.  In short, I love Nobara and the different type of girl she represents.  
Jujutsu Kaisen is building a large cast of characters with different agendas and backgrounds, and I can see these leading to subplots within the show that all tie into the overall story, much like Fullmetal Alchemist.  Characters like Gojo, Maki, and Noritoshi have their own goals in mind as they work with or clash with the main cast, and I think it will be very interesting to watch their stories unfold.  
Enjoyment 10
This is where Jujutsu Kaisen hits the hardest.  It's an exciting show to watch!  The characters are strong, and I root for them wholeheartedly when they're fighting their battles, external or internal.  I get sucked into this dark fantasy world of curses and sorcery when I'm watching, and I don't want to leave when the episode is over.  
Overall 10
This is only the first season of what will surely be a major series for years to come.  I haven't read the manga so I don't know what the future will hold, but the first season has me hyped up.  If you like shounen, you will like Jujutsu Kaisen, and chances are you've already seen it.  If don't like shounen, I would still recommend it, because I think Jujutsu Kaisen avoids some of the pitfalls other shounen fall into, by avoiding filler, repetition, and fan service.",10,aislinnhanako27

                It's the new popular shounen! It's highly rated! By the studio that adapted Shingeki no Kyojin! It's pretty generic.
Jujutsu Kaisen as a whole is an entertaining watch. It starts off rather weak with bland characters lacking in design, a bit too straightforward of a plot lacking depth in its storytelling. However it eventually picks up and becomes a fairly good watch.
The overall plot improves, characters gain more depth and dynamics. Battles become more intense with great animations, choreographies and cleverly thought out skill setups. It's a fun watch. However the series peaks around the late second to early third quarter and has another height near
                  the end, and feels rather bland otherwise.
This anime is worth giving a chance for the elements that make it good, but do not expect anything out of the ordinary if you have watched a lot of shounen anime and are accustomed to darker stories.",7,ryu2k2

                What a brilliant send-off the 24th episode of Jujutsu Kaisen was, so great.
Having watched the series since it started airing I was ecstatic, pogging, glued to my screen throughout pretty much the high majority of the season.
This show restores a great deal of the charm that brought me into the medium since I was a kid and at times I'd say that's how I felt.
It becomes immediately ingrained in your head that Jujutsu Kaisen does not venture out of the ordinary shounen anime standards you're used to seeing but instead it enhances what it already has tremendously and a lot it is a testament to
                  the fact that shounen anime in present time can be just as great or even better than some of its predecessors.
If you're reading this and episode 19 of Demon Slayer hit different for you too then you're in luck because that's basically this anime but stretched into an entire season, with a beautiful finisher to complete it.
Huge props to MAPPA for making the show so fucking jacked while also having worked on Attack on Titan simultaneously, to say impressive would be an understatement. Stay tuned for Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and watch this if you already haven't",9,distortiondear

                One of the animes to quickly make it to the top, I watched it very late. As I am patient enough to want to binge anime .. usually .. but after watching I plan to watch this as soon as S2 releases. 
Shonen anime tend to either do really well or somewhat skim the line of doing ok. This is one of those fantastic cases it does very well. The action was well drawn and put together. The characters are interesting, with some random comedic injections that could do without but never the less are still good. a decent story to follow. And another crazy
                  power scale that doesn't make much sense. (gotta love it)
The MCs drive to get stronger and help others seems weak at first, though as he grows and learns he finds a way to really make it his own and somewhat mature from it. 
Actions scenes always get me excited, especially when he meets his random BFF, great laughs as he learns to fight. Also, the realization of how weak he is compared to the ""King of Curses"" the resides inside of the MC shows how far he must go to ever be the best. It can be comical.
Great anime, with a good story and characters. I am excited for more and hope they fix some of the comedy to fit with their darker themes. The seriousness really makes the anime interesting, but some of the comedy can be a bit much or not good at times.",8,GameFreak1489

                La tuve que ver dos veces, porque la primera la vi de mala gana, y lógicamente, me pareció un shonen genérico mas del montón.

Los personajes femeninos 10/10 (Nobara supremacy), tenemos al equipo 7 bien hecho, Gojou es un arma de doble filo que se esta administrando genial, por dios todos los personajes tiene carisma (menos el imbécil de Mahito, que personaje de mierda), lo audio visual es hermoso, simplemente un disfrute.

                I took a very loose approach to this series. I had watched and read the first couple of episodes when it was airing and couldn't get into it. There were a few too many issues I had with the inconsistent tone, the characterization and just general presentation of a lot of its ideas at the start. I thought this was going to be another Demon Slayer where it looks good but the actual substance is nonexistent or infuriating to get to. 
I dove back into JJK now because I wanted to be able to see the movie in theaters, and honestly? I'm glad I did.
                  This full watchthrough finally made me understand the hype behind the series a bit, even if I didn't love it as much as everyone else did.
Jujutsu Kaisen, while still carrying the baggage of some of the tropes found within the Shonen demographic (characters being too young for the situations they're put in and being drawn way older as a result, tonal inconsistencies, lack of commitment to its themes in order to play it safe), manages to carve out its own identity by being a story about the uncertainty of growing up and the realization of how complex and scary the world can be. While this isn't necessarily unique to JJK (Bleach vibes anyone?), the series rapid pacing, presentation and focus on the human element within the horror that laces the series allows for a mature take on this sort of story.
The core characters involved are all incredibly likable. I didn't hate anyone, but I also didn't LOVE anyone either. I think there's a collection of people here that can become more fleshed out and lovable over time given more development. Season 1 as a whole suffers from it being Season 1, where the author is very clearly still trying to find their footing. I think Gege does by around Episode 8 or 9 and continues to build from there. A voice slowly begins to form and you get an understanding of how characters interact and how exposition is delivered to you to get an understanding of the world around you. The humor at times can be stale or annoying as a result, but once Gege begins to commit to a very dry sense of humor the series starts having charm and being funny in it's own way.
The biggest highlight of this adaptation is of course the animation and art. This series is stunning, never delivering an episode where I once felt as if the crew was holding back. The character animation is constantly vibrant, telling you everything you need to know about a person just by the way they fight or the way they walk. The choreography is fluid and impactful, dropping you right into the moment and allowing you to get sucked into these fights in a way that a lot of other series I think fail to grasp. There's a solid balance of rule of cool and actual emotional weight, though I personally am not a huge fan of how Gege consistently delivers that emotional weight AFTER the fight is over. It's an issue I've found a lot of modern Shonen series (especially Demon Slayer) have.
JJK is a series that I think scratches a great itch of wanting a stylized action series with some substance that keeps you invested. I really came around to enjoying this series over time and I'm glad I gave it a chance. I'm definitely going to catch up on the manga next. I really hope that the next season and the manga continue to build off this foundation. I'm giving the series an 8, but it's a soft one. It probably leans more on a 7 in terms of the content itself but the presentation of it was phenomenal and deserves credit for that. MAPPA definitely deserves to go to jail for how good this animation was btw.

OVERALL I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THE ANIME AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 2
let me end this review with my favorite word by the one and only Inamuki 
"" TUNA MAYO""",9,Nora_hikari
40748,"
                I'll start off with: Yes, it's good. It's getting mainstream attention because it deserves it, it's not just an empty hype train. Jujutsu Kaisen is fast paced action, heart-driven storytelling and power fantasy wish-fulfillment. In other words: Shounen at it's finest. If you want to say it's like such and such show that came before it, it's only because whatever show you're talking about was just as good at embodying the same concepts. Comparisons to Naruto seem to be the most common, likely stemming from people who've only ever seen 2 other anime so they don't have a lot of references to draw from. This
                  is a wildly different show with a few superficial similarities, and a protagonist far more like Goku or the Monkey King he's loosely based on.
The show has great action, though a somewhat generic power system. There were a few stand out powers that were unique, just the overall way they work with a generic inner energy source fueling the wide array of abilities we see. The protagonist gets to be strong without seeming too overpowered right out the gate, so there's obviously room for him to grow. Having the teacher be as strong as he is feels sort of like a cheat, a cheap way to write your way out of a corner if your heroes get into too much of a pinch but thankfully his personality and the fact that the adventurers guild is spread so thin go a long way to convince the audience he isn't always going to be around to save the day.
The villains are done excellently. Right from the introduction of the main baddies we're treated to the very real threat they pose, and the purely evil nature they exhibit. There's no campy mustache twirling bad guys, and they do an excellent job of making you hate them right away. One critique is how they keep getting away and surviving, takes a bit away from any sense of accomplishment on the heroes part if you just let the villains live anyway, but it does add to the threat because you know exactly what they're capable of and what's at stake now when they meet the hero again.
Overall I had a great time and binged the whole thing in a couple sittings. Any show that can do that, especially with all the fatigue I've felt lately watching some shows, must be a good one in my book. 9/10",9,lamaraptor
40748,"
                I wanted to enjoy this. But I just can't. I just end up laboring myself to even finish an episode when that movie enthusiast schoolmate got introduced.
I'll make it short by saying I really couldn't vibe with any of the characters, both protagonists and antagonists. Yuuji, our main protagonist, his main goal is essentially saving people in which he got from his Gramps which we've only known for half an episode then proceeded to yeet himself in order to actually be useful. Hopefully the story wasn't aiming to make me feel sorry for him because I really couldn't for such a basic, no development character.
                  Yuuji's two squadmates too, Nobara/Fushiguro, they're actually much more enjoyable than him but it's not saying much. 
To the antagonists too, they say their goal was to make the curses superior to humans but that isn't really a good excuse for them to be such bad villains, are they? They're evil for the sake of evil kind of villains. They scheme because they're evil, they kill because they're evil. In that restaurant scene where they got introduced, I was actually kinda hyped about them but it all died down real quick when the show couldn't contain its lust to make them kill the customers just to show how 'evil' they are.
To end the review, I'll say that the godly animation is doing the hard work for this series and Nanami is the most, if not the only, relatable character in the show.",7,Hereditus
40748,"
                truly i have been put into a tight spot, on ne hand i could give this anime a 9 or 8, but have decided to give it a 10, besides being itself an amazing adaptation defenitely on par with the manga written by Gege Akutami, the animation and sound would please even the harshest of critics, but besides the production value, does it offer any substantial message or story? 
by my scoe you can probably guess what i think.
so lets break why this is a great story, it is first of all very direct, and its fast pace makes it feel like time isnt being
                  wasted, big plus if youre a shounen fan who is a bit tired of authors streching what could be waaay shorter; also death is a not only a theme of the story but something the charcters must overcome aswell, death doesnt have a build up sometimes, i see any people say how stupid or pointless the death of the gramps was at the beginning, but to me it sets the tone perfectly, showing how just like real life, death just comes with no warning.
besides that the character have this sense of humanity and nuance i just cant overlook, each one of them have flaws that seem very personal to me, from segregation, self-loathing and loneliness.
its also extremely impressive the amount of dread shown while also not being a downer, its funny, at least when it tries.
its wonderfull how much care was put into this adaptation, and its apparently the worst part of the manga for many, so the adaptation is a blessing if that was though to get through, the plot might not be amazing, but its creating something building it and  I can assure you, that the later part do NOT dissapoint.",10,bandwagon
40748,"
                        Shonen in general tends to be a genre that either hits a certain mark or it doesnt. There is no real criteria as to what shows you will enjoy or hate. I really loved this show. 
        Being familiar with the manga before starting to watch it, I had high hopes for the anime, and boy did my expectations get blown away
you can see that the team at MAPPA really did their best to deliver an incredibly well-made show. It hits all the expected shonen boxes, yet I cant help
                  but feel like it succeeds where many others fail, either by overexplaining the world aorund them, or by ignoring too much of said world, focusing solely in the protagonist and how the story revolves around him. For me, JJK hits the balance between the overpowered protagonist and a bland one (Yuji regularly fails and has to deal with said failures, many times growing him as a character in these moments, making him stronger. Most times, he is a player in a bigger game, and he pretty much never ends up being the magical solution for the problems the story presents). Tone-wise, it is a bit ""darker"" than other shonens (specially down the line, in the manga), tho it doesn´t cross any extra edgy limits, refraining from trying too hard.
        The cast is interesting, although it is up to the spectator to form connections with the characters, I indeed felt the cast and the world really mingled in a beautiful way, with all the deeper moments being complemented with an outstanding animation and soundtrack.
Overall, I highly recomend this show. I havent enjoyed many shonens in the last couple of years, but somehow this one did captivate me in an unexpected way. With a prequel movie coming (Vol 0) and an innevitable new season maybe next year, we have much to expect for JJK's future, be it in the TV or in the manga (which I, once again, surely recommend if you enjoyed this season).
        For my experience, making me fall in love with the genre warrants it a 10/10, even with its flaws. I hope people enjoy the show as much as I did, and continue to support GeGe's work!",10,Gabud873

                This is my first review so and sorry in advance for my English, it´s not my native lenguage.
Personally I think it´s an alright first season, nothing special but not bad either, let´s see if the movie and a second season changes my perspective.
The thing that carried on this season was the excellent animation on the fights scenes (not a surprise) and the artsyle, that in my opnion is better than the source material.
But the animation and artsyle are not everything in an anime, the story matters too and this is one of the flaws on this season, the story isn´t attractive or interesting, something that
                  affected  my enjoymet of the show, but I´m gonna give it a pass because it´s just the first season and it´s the begginig of a shonen.
Another flaw I see are the characters, none of them were deep or anything, just cool teens doing cool things, Nobara and Megumi have some backstories but I needed more to emphatize with them because in all the season I could care lees about what happened with them, also some of the caracther design, specially the villains are bad .
The Soundtrack was good but none of them stuck in my head , I woud say it was very generic.

This is a theme that is merely a shadow underlying the overall series. While this series starts off a bit more on the typical side of your fantasy action Shounen stories, it oozes with its unique theme revolving around curses as you get deeper into it. The action is quite top notch with great choreography and splashes of over-the-top anime goodness, and the soundtrack is often gritty and energetic matching with the theme of the series. The characters are quite the delight with their own quirks, where some will stand out more than others. You will especially see the main
                  character, Itadori Yuuji, grow more as the story progresses as he learns not only how to use his own unique curse powers but also cope with loss as he finds out that saving everyone can be quite the momumental task.

If you're looking for an intriguing plot and characters you may be a little disappointed, but that's not to say their isn't some great characters in here. Also, the concept of having the ultimate bad-guy sharing

I haven't enjoyed a Shonen this much in a very long time (yes including demon slayer and bnh). so its a very solid 8/10.

                  wanna have fun.",8,or0126

                It's a fun and fun shounen to watch, the characters are good and interesting, the powers are very creative and even the anime universe itself is well created, although it has a clear inspiration from Bleach, the characters are very charismatic and easy to get around. like, besides the very simple plot and cliché of shounen, but that is far from bad. About the production of the anime, it is simply fantastic, the animation and direction in the fight moments are great, fluid movement in all of them and very well synchronized with the scenarios that are mostly in CGI, the only thing I was
                  left with it was the lack of explanation of some powers like Gojo, the anime gives a lot of impression that he's awesome because he is and period, I hope that in Season 2 they explain the things that were open in relation to this.",8,Joaomar007

                When I was watching the first 13 episodes, I was getting a solid 9/10 vibe out of this anime. A lovable set of characters, each have their own stories and overcomings, a really good power system, and still being able to break some shonen molds. But for me, those first 13 episodes still feel like, something is missing, and I can't put my finger on it.
But then, the second cour happened, and BAH GAWD IT'S THE BEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN.
The goodwill event is all I ever wanted from a tournament arc. It has all the great battles to keep you pumped up throughout the
                  arc, great character developments to keep us invested in all the new characters introduced in the arc, all of that are encapsulated with a WHOPPER of a final boss fight. May have mirrored a bit from the Naruto tournament arc, but this tournament arc, might just be the end-all-be-all of tournament arcs.
And the excitement didn't just stop there. The baseball episode may be my most favorite filler episode yet (right up there with Kill la Kill episode 4 and SK8 beach episode). Not only did it serve as relief after a belter of an arc, it still managed to be entertaining by incorporating all the characters' developments till that point. Then, the Yasohachi Bridge arc is just the cherry on top on this beautiful cake. Seeing Megumi, Nobara, and Yuji being in a trio action once again, made a really satisfying end to the trios' current development.
I haven't spoken much about the first cour (mainly because of one certain heart-wrenching arc that I don't want to remember; still quite good tho), but I'm not taking anything away from it. It is still a really good watching experience. The trio of Yuji, Nobara, and Megumi, along with Gojo, really just kept me entertained with all of their interactions (Yuji and Nobara one brain cell moments are the sugar that daddy likes).
All that being said, this is truly peak shounen.",10,FlipFire95

                Just like the Tokyo Revengers, Jujutsu Kaisen was really popular when it was first aired last year. And seeing that it is supernatural, I knew I had to watch it too, unfortunately I wasn’t able to watch it sooner, hahaha.
I only watched the trailer this year, but seeing all those posts about this anime on my facebook feed, I have a feeling that I will really enjoy this one. And I sure did!
Opening & Closing Theme + Song: 8/10
That first opening theme is definitely one of my favorites. I can already feel the hype just watching it plus the song fits it perfectly. I am
                  also loving the animation so far, well, I usually love anything from MAPPA anyway, *wink.
The first ending theme on the other hand is very cute. And that song!!!!!!
The second opening also looks captivating, but I think it lacks excitement when compared to the first opening. The second closing on the other hand exudes emotion, not just because of the scenes but also because of the song. I love it!
Story: 6/10
Jujutsu Kaisen has a very simple story: monsters (curses) exist, people eliminate these curses (sorcerers). In terms of originality, there isn’t that much, but Jujutsu Kaisen has a really strong power system, which is the cursed energy. Cursed energy is kind of like Chakra from Naruto. Both need a good amount of focus and training to achieve them. The only difference is that in Naruto, chakra exists in all beings, however in Jujutsu Kaisen, not everyone has cursed energy. Those who can’t use cursed energy use cursed tools instead which is a really interesting concept.
Jujutsu Kaisen’s story as a whole may be typical and generic, but I think they were able to deliver just enough message through its story and characters which gives it that tiny edge over other successful shounen series. There are only 24 episodes for the first season, so I understand the time constraints but I really like how they were able to make use of the time and gave us not just action packed scenes but also interesting backstory of not just the main characters but also the other characters involved. I believe all of those scenes are a healthy amount of seasoning where it doesn’t feel forced at all, and quite natural within the scope of each character and their personalities.
However, the first episode may be a bit of a downer since we literally jumped right into the world of curses without much exploration of the relationship between Itadori and his deceased grandfather. But I think for me, it wasn’t a total downer since I always love my series to start with action hahaha, but it will eventually brought up on the next episodes, *wink.
Another thing I like about this series is how it was able to switch tones from dark and gritty into a light hearted one perfectly. There was definitely no boring moment in the entire time I was watching it, despite the story being simple and typical, I really enjoyed this series.
Sometimes simplicity isn’t always the killer, and Jujutsu Kaisen definitely proved that to me, *wink.
Characters: 9/10
Itadori, Yuuji
At the start of this series, you can already see that he’s a very likeable character so he gets along well with basically anyone. He’s also physically gifted so it was no wonder how easily he got stronger even though most of his training is just binge watching a movie lol (but there’s an explanation to that, hahaha).
Just like most shounen main characters, Itadori may look and act like an idiot but he sticks to his principle which is actually very admirable. It’s just a very short watch, but I really like watching his growth in this series.
Fushiguro, Megumi
Just looking at him, you can already tell that he’s probably the most sensible in the trio. So I was really surprised that he used to be such a delinquent before, hahaha. He cares for his friends and you can really see his potential to be a great sorcerer.
Kugisaki, Nobara
The only girl in the trio, but don’t let that fool you. Kugisaki is both girly and strong, the same qualities that I want to have for my female leads. She’s confident of her beauty and doesn’t flinch to get dirty when fighting, which is really badass. She also cares for her friends and is such a really interesting character.
Gojou, Satoru
The ever popular Gojou sensei. You can’t talk about Jujutsu Kaisen without mentioning Gojou. He’s the most powerful jujutsu sorcerer, like very OP! It was actually hard to imagine at first since he’s very playful and carefree...unless he gets really serious. You’ve got to see him without his blindfolds on, I’m sure you’ll get jealous how beautiful his eyes and EYELASHES are. I swear he and Fushiguro have the most beautiful eyelashes in this series, lol.
Aside from those I’ve individually mentioned above, Jujutsu Kaisen has some really cool side characters like Panda, Maki, Inumaki, Toudou. Every character in this series is freaking good and interesting, even the antagonists Sukuna and Mahito have a considerable amount of depth to them which makes this series even better.
Art: 10/10
I don’t usually fuss on this aspect just as long as it looks beautiful to me and I love the story. There were some few anime out there that looked beautiful but failed in the fighting scenes, but Jujutsu Kaisen delivered perfectly on both. I’m not sure about you, but I love everything.
I haven’t read the manga yet so I can’t differentiate or make a comparison whether they closely follow the manga or not, but I really liked the character design.
Also another thing that is worth mentioning is Jujutsu Kaisen’s eye catchers. They are those intro type clips that are often in the middle of an episode. Jujutsu Kaisen’s eye catcher is captivating, and I love this horror-y feel to it.
***
To sum it all up, Jujutsu Kaisen is definitely a very good series. New anime don’t always work for me, but I have to say that this series is definitely one of the good ones. YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WATCH THIS!",8,blushinggeek

                Jujutsu Kaisen is a very good start to something really cool. I have many issues with it, but seeing as it will continue to get seasons and what I've heard from those who have read the manga, I can easily see my issues getting resolved later on.
The biggest strength Jujutsu Kaisen has is its animation. Mappa did a fantastic job making this show feel so dynamic and beautiful. One thing I can really commend them on is their attention to detail when converting the manga to anime. There are several times in which they almost directly rip the manga panels and make them into scenes.
                  It's extremely impressive and I would recommend a watch just for that alone. 
while the animation is a huge part of a show's appeal, the characters and story are what drives it, and this is where I start to have a few issues. my issues all stem from the story structure of Jujutsu Kaisen. I don't believe Megumi, Nobara, Gojo, or any of the characters besides Itadori are near as fleshed out as I would like and when they are, I think it is a little too late in the narrative so the actions of the characters beforehand are harder to relate to. The fight scenes with Megumi and Nobara are cool and look impressive, but the show doesn't let me know why I should really care about the well-being of these characters.
That being said the characters are fun and on a surface level, they are entertaining to watch, Panda and Toge being prime examples. Although they are fun to watch I can't help but feel that they should be a bit more fleshed out. 
The story is certainly interesting and JJK does a great job of building up cool moments such as the fight with Hanami and the fight with Mahito. However, there are times in which I think the build-up is a little too quickly such as the last 2 episodes against the brothers. We see them for one episode and that's it. 
I also think the first half of the season is spent too long on Itadori exclusively. On one hand. I understand the need for him to train but I think focusing on solely him leaves very little time to flesh out everyone else. 
I know this review sounds horribly negative but there is a lot of great things here. Itadori is a very good protagonist and the lore is thick. The performances especially those of Yuichi Nakamura (Gojo), Asami Seto (Nobara), and Yoshitaka Yamaya (Junpei) are three I believe stick out as great performances. The action scenes are definitely something to watch this show for alone. They are unbelievably impactful and a sight to behold. 
Overall, the show oozes cool and has some great moments with a lot of memorable characters, if a bit too shallow for my liking. 
Currently, JJK stands at an 8.3/10 in my opinion. I can see its potential to be much higher and even to the point of being a modern masterpiece. But, as it stands, JJK season 1 is a solid start to something really cool and not much more.",8,imajellydonut0

                Finally, a good shounen after a long time from 2019 mob psycho 100 season 2 was the last good shounen i watched, Jujutsu Kaisen is one of the best modern shounen after the let down of Demon Slayer i finally have faith again.

Story: yeah not that complicated but still enjoyable the best thing that i liked is the cursed techniques and power system thank god they explained what's going on not just a superpower that came from nowhere like Demon Slayer .. it's no complicated like the Nen system in Hunter x Hunter but i'm really
                  like the idea

Character: nothing to say more I liked almost every character in the show they are unique and interesting yeah Gojo of course my favorite character also Fushiguro remind me of V from Devil May Cry 5 i liked his style in fighting a lot
BUT what i didn't like is the antagonists they are leaking of the charisma of good villains like HxH ( I'm sorry that i always comparing with HxH but i love this show a lot) also the designs of them are very boring except for Hanami the earth monster 
i didn't care about them and i even can't remember most of their names 
-SPOILER skip this part if you want-
about Junpei Yoshino he just appeared for three episodes and when he dead Itadori almost lost it and their relationship was not that big even they didn't say they are friends as i remember so it was a little lit down

Enjoyment:  i watched the show in just five days after the show finished, i can't say anything more one of the best shounen ever made

                Starts of quite slow and honestly uninteresting  at least to me but as the story got darker it became extremely interesting to watch and near the end of the season I was so surprised with the amount of character development the mcs got. Especially megumi. It felt like the characters were actually affected by the things around them and not to mention how outstanding the music is?? The final fight of the season was the best one imo. Can't wait for the movie! It really doesn't feel like any other mainstream anime. I honestly was surprised by how original it was even though it
                  takes the old formula of a solid shonen. The themes aren't something new or never seen before but it was handled in a unique and refreshing way. You actually start caring for the characters and so far i do like that there is not a lot of plot armor which is my biggest ick usually. The dynamic between the main three is so fun to watch and it's actually not forced. Also to add that i enjoy no fan service and forced romance between the mcs so thank u for that.",8,deukaee

I don't write many reviews but I felt like I needed to for this one. I'm not one to watch stuff like this too much but I ended up going through this because of an anime watch group i'm part of, and man am I glad I did. This was one hell of a fun ride.
Story: 10
This show just absolutely sucks you in. There were a few times where the show would start and when the OP hit all I could think was ""Damn, the episode is already over?"". Nope. It just started. Any time the OP was delayed this was my reaction.
                  It just grabs you and keeps giving.
Art: 9
This is a beautiful show. The fight scenes are really fun to watch and are pretty creative most of the time.
Sound: 9
The only time I really didn't like the music was the first ED. It felt really jarring compared to some of the scenes we end up leaving off on. To me it just didn't match too well. Everything else was damn near amazing though. I still listen to OP 1 from time to time. The in show music also fits well and sounds great.
Character: 10
This one one of my favorite aspects of the show. All the characters, main and side, were super fun and interesting. The female side of the cast especially was really captivating. No damsel in distress bullshit or anything, and they mostly all had some damn good moments.
The villain side of the cast was also well done. When they get hit all you can do is f**kin cheer. You'd basically give anything to see them destroyed.
I can't think of a single character that I really didn't like here.

as you can see, i really love everything about jujutsu kaisen. i have to be honest, i didn't really expect to love it this much before watching it just because i saw a lot of people hyping it up and stuff like other well known anime like aot and demon slayer (both good anime imo but not the best for me) so i expected it to be good but not as good as it really is, if that makes sense.

                 Jujutsu Kaisen it one of those shows which doesn't come very often but when it does it breaks the internet, because of how good it is.
 It is as good as shounen gets. The art is absolutely fantastic the only complain I have is the video of the second opening has some ugly CGI in my opinion but it doesn't. Mappa really outdid themselves this time every frame is beautifully animated and they don't compromise with CGI we haven't had such beautifully animated battles since probably Fate.
 The story starts very interesting with a very likable main protagonist and his grandpa. I think the
                  way it started was genius and very unique. We have a battle every episode all of the arcs are interesting but again I only have one complain and it is that in the middle they spent a couple of episodes telling us the backstory of characters which we couldn't give less shit about, they were introduced and in the next episode we are already learning about their backstories.
 I don't think I have a single complain about the sounds/music. The music was fantastic, the openings slapped and the voice actors were very talented.
 As I already said we had to learn the backstories of some characters that we couldn't care less about but those were just a couple the others were very likable and Todo was really cool.

                On a technical level, JJK is about as good as shounen anime has gotten. The music is great, the animation is great, the voice acting is great, the openings are great. There are almost no flaws with the presentation.
JJK also has an incredibly likable cast of characters. They are not the most complex or dynamic, but they are enjoyable which is arguably the most important quality characters in a long running series can have. The villains can't quite match up to their hero counterparts in this regard but the series is young. The character interactions are also gold, with many hilarious side gags and insults
                  being shared in a consistently endearing way.
The biggest issues with JJK are plot and consistency. There is a plot, things are introduced and characters take action, but it never has a sense of direction or momentum. Even in other shounen series that like to take their time, the beginning usually establishes some long term goal. We have the same here, but it is so weak in comparison to becoming the Pirate King or Hokage that it doesn't register. This flaw effects the characters tool. It seems like most of the cast is sitting around waiting for story beats to happen so their arcs can begin. 
Consistency here is most relevant to the magic system, which just is what you think it would be knowing this is a paranormal shounen. Elements are introduced when the plot needs them and you things will be described as incredibly difficult or rare without any proper set up. The designation of 'special grade' goes out the window almost immediately. Domain Expansion is probably the well defined concept, but even then the characters weirdly do not discuss it out of combat.
With a strong, definitive adaptation JJK will establish itself as one of the most popular shounen, and THE gateway shounen, of this generation. It does not yet have the quality to back that status although I am surprisingly optimistic given reports from manga readers and the fact that its issues can all be fixed with better writing. The character foundation is so strong that if the plot and magic are handled better, all will be forgiven.
Score: decent 7",7,Daniel_Pezzi
40748,"
                It is not that JJK is the best anime out there - it is more about what it doesn't do wrong and it's overall quality. The source material in itself is amazing so studio Mappa had the best opportunity to deliver great action sequences and plot twists.
However, the show has a serious problem with pacing. The retrospective explanations of fight elements might work in a medium like Manga but the extensive use (I mean you have a flashback on how a certain technique was learned/a certain important dialogue was shared BEFORE the current fight scene) in every single episode. Then, things become very slow for
                  1/2 - 1 eps and suddenly extremely fast. This pacing problem is not present in the Manga and shows that sometimes you have to adapt the source material to a different medium.",9,yoloswagger95
40748,"
                It's good for what it is. I just don't connect with the premise, the characters, or the action. 
Story
Student is super strong for some reason. Eats a cursed artifact and, contrary to most other people, is able to contain it. Demon slaying corp enacts a plan to have him eat the rest of the cursed pieces and then kill him to destroy the pieces. It's a decent set up for an anime so far. 
Then we get into demon slaying school. There are other characters who have their quirks. Pretty cool. 
The next part of the story was an arc involving a high school guy
                  getting bullied. The guy has demon powers and gets his justified revenge. There is a super bad demon involved - the guy who giggles and with the stitches on his face. He is a bad baddie. 
The situation with him got resolved and that's where I dropped this show. I felt like I got a taste of it and didn't want to watch another 10+ episodes to see how the rest of it played out. 
Altogether, the story I experienced wasn't bad at all. It hits good notes and is interesting enough. It's nothing above average though. There weren't any story moments that made me stop in shock. 
Characters
The characters were okay. I don't like overpowered characters and we got a couple of them here. OP characters make victories feel cheap. If our good guys are just chilling, throwing punches, narrating their attacks, and not breaking a sweat, it takes the piss out of the entire thing. That's what I was feeling here. With an exception of the salaryman and the giggly stitch face, none of the fights had real tension for me because the characters weren't sweating. 
The main man, Itadori, is your high school student who is a little nerdy, a shade goofy, but mostly good natured and cool guy. He's a good MC. Then you get the black haired mentor guy. He's the calm introvert of the group. The girl is studious but spunky. And then there's the white haired guy who is OP. 
It's a decent group of characters. I enjoyed their non-action, hanging out moments. 
The bad guys. . . I'm not sure. There was the owner of the fingers. He was evil and obviously scheming something. I'm not going to stick around to see how it plays out. 
Then there was the stitch-faced giggler. He was kind of lame. For starters, I didn't find him scary. He was a little unpredictable but his vibe didn't strike well with me. 
The good guys were above average characters. They were fun. The bad guys were below average. Average characters overall. 
Art
The art was good. High-quality modern art work. Nothing bad stuck out. It was good to look at the entire way through. 
The character design was decent. The men had the same spikey hair. I guess it's a thing but maybe the black-haired introvert could have used another style. 
Sound
The opening theme was just okay. It's rock and that's cool but it wasn't a high-impact hitter. I loved the ending theme. I loved the vibe and the art that went with it. It sounded like bboy music. When it came on, I wanted to stand up and groove with the characters. 
I loved the art of the ED too. The marker work splashed and had so much energy. Even the girl swining her shopping bags around was amazing to watch. I have been watching darker animes recently and to see our characters having a good time dancing and eating was a real palate cleanser. I wish that I could be a fraction as cool as those characters in my life. What a damn good ED. 
The voices and stuff seemed to fit. I don't speak Japanese so I can't really tell about the wordplay and the jokes. But the voices and emotions matched. 
Direction, Action, Symbols, and HS English Class Stuff
I didn't like the action of the show. It involved the characters simply being super strong, jumping really high, and punching and kicking hard. I hate plotless punching contests. 
The girl with the hammer and nails had an interesting fighting style. It matched the demon slaying theme, was visually interesting, and I had never seen the hammer and nail being used as an exorcism weapon. That was cool. The black haired guy had his animal minions. Pretty cool too. 
But the Itadori and Gojo fought by punching and kicking and that was not cool. I hate it when characters just get mad, power-up, and continue to do what they were doing to win a fight. There has to be some innovation, some learning, some adjustments. I love the AoT fights because the someone figures something out during each encounter. They have an insight, make the adjustment, and use it. And all of it is intensely internally consistent. For those two characters, it's all about their innate ability. They just know how to fight. They're determined by their birthed power level. There was supposed to be some training but it all fell backseat to their level. Hated it. It's too video-gamey. 
The action is kinetic, no doubt. But it didn't involve anything more than ""my level is higher than your level so I'm going to punch you harder"". It's too much like Power Ranger & Dragonball. I never dug the action in those. 
Enjoyment
Watching 12 episodes of this was a chore. I wasn't having a good time with it. I'm not a demon enthusiast. I always have trouble with the basic demon questions: Who made them? What do they want? Do they simply enjoy haunting people? Do they just want to survive? Are they just an animal that eats humans? Also, I was looking forward to the action but was disappointed. 
So out of story, characters, and action, I only found the good guy characters to be above average. 
Overall
I see why people like this show but it didn't hit for me. 
The story was average. The characters were average. The action/presentation was below average. The ED had me grooving so +1 there. 
I'm just not having a good time with demon fighting stuff.",5,barsoapguy219

The only negative thing I've seen people write is that the story is nothing new...like seriously every story is not new, get over it, it's all based on storylines that have existed before. As far as the whole exorcist/cursed sprit scene goes, this story is quite enjoyable. Not a lot of lore but that's fine. 
The characters are all likeable, badass, understandable. No sakura-like useless characters, no
                  dumb gags ( the gags are actually really funny), and MAPPA killed it with the animations.
Considering what's been coming out the last few years, this has been refreshing to watch, gave me those vibes of when I first started watching anime.",10,yakshaa

                Well Jujutsu Kaisen is the archetype of the cliche shounen that tries to deepen every cliche to make them better.
And, at least for me, it worked.
A classic story of demons like bleach and a bunch of other manga, a ""naruto"" shounen OP (understand by that, a kind and idiot MC that wants to protect everyone and who possesses a hidden power because of a demon). But that's all.
Like I said everything is a cliche but a nicely done cliche. 
Yes MC is an idiot but not a low IQ like naruto, yes he's kind but not a delusional unable to harm an opponent like naruto
                  or Natsu (fairy tale). He discovers the world in which he lives in and understands that some demons are just rotten and unable to become human again. He's able to anger himself without being possessed by the demon unlike naruto, he's ablse to say by himself ""i'm going to kill you"" with a straight face. And god it's pleasant to see in a world where all shounens seem to be made for 10 years old kids...
For the story it's the same situation, understand that those 24 episodes are an introduction to the world, the anime is just showing of what he's made. Beautiful animations, nice fights, very good characters, badass characters, even the story seems to be interesting, I think of a particular arc (no spoil) that features great emotions, death, character dev and more !
this shounen has got a big potential and I hope the second season  confirms my words.",9,Proto57

                I've been hearing about this anime for a while now so I finally decided to give it a watch. Turns out, there is validity to the hype. It's a blast to watch. Jujutsu Kaisen is a Shonen anime in a world where negative or cursed energy from Humans can manifest into beings or curses which then terrorize. Most people can't control it but those who can are known as Jujutsu Sorcerers. The story follows an unnaturally fit High School student who gets wrapped up in this world after a fateful encounter. 
The world presented here is intriguing. I was hooked from the start and was
                  on board to know more about the world and the characters that inhabit it. It's a Shonen anime so you definitely get the usual tropes but it's the execution of them where it sets itself apart to a degree where you get this layer of freshness that you might not have gotten if it just did everything by the book through and through. 
There are plenty of characters in the 24 episodes that are available at the time of writing and most of them are likeable and interesting. My favourite character so far is Gojo, his charisma and powers alongside his view of the world and being a teacher made me love him. The protagonist, and his trio as well as other students all have something going for them where you get attached to them. Even those who might come off as one dimensional and unlikeable have more than what meets the eye and as the episodes go on, you start enjoying them and the best example of that is Aoi Todo. I didn't like him when he initially appeared but boy did the anime turn that around when you get to know more of him.  
The anime is extremely well-paced with pretty much every episode having something interesting going on with many being jam-packed. There is a TON of action and what makes it great is that the variety of action sequences and the powers displayed by the characters are plentiful keeping things from going stale throughout. Of course, it wouldn't be nearly as entertaining if it weren't for MAPPA and them putting in the hard work to animate it all beautifully. The action sequences can be sublime and because of the sheer number of them, I have to tip my hat off to the animators. It sounds good too with some great OST tracks that hype things up well. 
I was not expecting Jujutsu Kaisen to be this hilarious, though. It has serious stuff in it but it also has a ton of comedy mixed in with the entire structure and a lot of it is pretty good. Some of it had me in tears.  
Overall, I had a great time watching the 24 episodes that are out now and am looking forward to watching the movie and more seasons. It's highly entertaining and if you like Shonen type animes and want to watch a recent one that is a complete package while also feeling fresh, I'd highly recommend this. Give it a try even if you don't like the genre but the premise intrigues you. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it an 8.5/10.",8,Spartan_1_1_7
40748,"
                I want to preface with the fact that I rate this a 10/10 Solely because of enjoyment and not because of some objective measurements.
Jujutsu Kaisen is essentially, a Naruto Reboot. I watched Naruto for like 20 episodes at the beginning and 20 episodes at the end and skipped the rest and more or less got the gist of things. It was slow, bland, boring, old. Jujutsu Kaisen takes all of the Naruto features and bundles them in to a more digestible and entertaining show.
Firstly J.K. gives us something to look forward to. Although it has the typical group of protagonists vs antagonists shounen-ing their way
                  to greatness, it has a bigger overarching plot line. This alleviates a lot of the weight that the animation and character design has to carry. A lot of the time, shounen's lean heavily on the quirks and features of their characters and making everything as hype as possible. Here, that hype is well supported by a ""potential future"" that we will all be building up to.
Secondly, the cast of characters combined with the animation style, sound, colors, etc, is perfect for the high dopamine addiction's of today. More hype, more energy, more everything. It pays off! Everything oozes with personality, even though it may not be the most unique show ever. I mean, Gojo is just Kakashi, but younger and s*xier. That is just one example.
Thirdly, Nobara is hot.
That's all I got.",10,Singular9

                Unbelievable. Did not expect it to be this good. Constant action. Every single episode feels like a movie, the animation is just that good. The story and characters are unique and the show has some good bit of humor going for it as well. 
Storyline:
The general progression of the story is well paced and like I said they constantly keep introducing new characters that make the story interesting and helps keep the storyline fresh. 
Animation:
Some of the fight scenes are beyond amazing and the amount of work poured into it is phenomenal. Especially ones involving prominent characters.
Soundtracks:
The opening is really good. The first one in
                  particular, captures your interest from the first time you hear it. Other than that the ones during the anime itself feel natural.",9,Optiarou68

                Jujutsu Kaisen, a fairly recent anime that exploded in social media and gained a huge amount of fame. Is it worth all the comotion it gets? Probably not, but that's the curse (PUN INTENDED) this social media fame animes have to go through, apart from this it was good.
It's clear that this anime will have a 2nd season and when it does, I hope it complements some huge plot-holes in this 1st season. Never the less, it was enjoyable to watch.
As a huge sy-fi action anime fan, when I saw this anime literally everywhere I just had to give it a try, and even tho
                  I found it underwhelming, from what I was expecting anyway, I enjoyed it and I'm actually very excited for the upcoming seasons. Another thing I must point out since it caught me by surprise was the amount of humour in this, by no means am I complaining, I actually found it refreshing, usually this kind of animes have a very strong dark theme, but Jujutsu Kaisen actually made me laugh in almost every episode, and I appreciate that.
Taking things apart it will go something likes this:
-Story: 7- I found the overall story a little slow paced, I understand that they kinda focused on the characters development and just generally intruducing us to this world of Jujutsu Kaisen, nevertheless I was expecting more. But has I said before I really enjoyed the humour in this and it actually countered the lack of dept in the plot. Without giving out spoilers I can't really say much more. With this all said, it's clear that this season alone it's not worth much.
-Art 10- One thing I absolutly loved in this was the art, not only its style but the animations themself, they were all amazing, I really appreciate MAPPA for being able to do such work of beauty. I consider myself a very visual person, so good animations and art have a very strong toll on me, and this anime had exactly that.
-Sound 8- Since I'm more of a visual person, sounds and music don't interest me as much, but I do like to see a good opening/ending and good background music. The op/end didn't gave me that wow factor but the background music was well done and it gave scenes, such as fighting ones, a good ambience.
-Character 7- Tho the story itself was lacking, I think the time they spent building some characters were actually a good strategy. Nevertheless it wasn't enough to make me attach to them (and I do that a lot). Obviously I'm very interested in the future development of the Main Characters, specially the relation between Itadori e Sukuna, and some Support ones too, but I only started to really care to know them in the last few episodes, I guess this one will stay opened until future updates. 
-Enjoyment & Overall 8- Based on all this, the weak, explainable begining, plot, yet amazing art, and kinda interesting characters to good sound ambience it was enjoyable and I definetly want to see a season 2 in the future.

                Jujutsu Kaisen is fantastic. With the rise of shounen anime taking over the recent years and the Gen Z market, it's hard to compete. Fire Force, Demon Slayer, and shows like MHA have taken over the scene as the new norm. So for a show to come out swinging and make an impact this big, it's a big deal. 
Jujutsu Kaisen does it all right. It's a classic action anime about how a boy gets his life turned upside down after learning about a power that he has. But it branches out with unique characters that make you laugh every time they are on screen,
                  a unique take that does world building write by borrowing and twisting aspects of other shows to make it their own. Each and every character feels unique to one another, and while there are tropes here and there, i wouldn't question anyone for any character in this show being their favorite. I can't think of a character I didn't like. 
The fight scenes are also fan-fucking-tastic. They are done so well, and I've heard from manga readers that the studio really tried their best to do the manga justice. There wasn't a single scene that I wasn't glued to the screen watching what was going to happen next. The antagonists are well written, not perfect but enough to not fall asleep, and even some of the minor villains had me feeling bad for them. That's always good writing when in the back of your mind, you want the MC to stop his punch right before it hits the villain. 
Overall, super reliable watch. Very entertaining with some of the best animated fight scenes out there, likable characters, great plot that sets up later seasons without making you dread cliffhangers, and it managed to break me out of my boredom of anime. I can't wait to see how it progresses. ~",8,Muphsi

                with the season comes to the end I was very happy of what MAPPA had given. JJK is definitely have been one of the best adaptation that I have seen. MAPPA definitely setting the bar for JJK in this season, I have high expectation too for the next season to come.
from a story point of view it is a typical shounen that you would see often, but somehow the way the it tells feels like something new and familiar at the same time. I would say to for the character it's something that is done very right, all the good thing that you find in
                  typical shounen genre merge into this great complex dimensional character. I enjoy every single bits of it, from character, dynamic, too relationship between each of the character. 
the art and the soundtrack in this series just made everything better. I love the work that put into JJK animation, especially the fight scene. it was a great time to watch from the dynamic to the choreography in the fight scene. amazing adaptation, thank you MAPPA :)",9,Kee_Nq

                SPOILERS
This anime flows really well, I never get bored while watching and wanna continue watching. I thought it was about wizard fights with lots of spells so was a bit disappointed at all the close range martial arts but it does have really cool fight scenes and lots of interesting interactions near the end. 
I quite like Itadori, Yuuji and Kugisaki, Nobara's character desgins. They are like brave, bold, open, no sappy bullcrap types that's quite refreshing. The side characters are also interesting. Every character in the school has a struggle. Different characters might be fighting each other but they all have some not evil
                  reason they're fighting like earning money for their brothers or raising social status of their mother or proving their worth.",7,meccc
40748,"
                Jujutsu Kaisen story goes more or less like this, Yuji Itadori a cool high schooler who knows how to have a good fight gets involved in a spirit/ghost incident with another mysterious high schooler named Megumi Fushigoro where Itadori accidentally eats a cursed finger that belonged to a powerful demon called Sukuna, soon enough Sukuna possess the body of Itadori but it is revealed that Itadori has what it takes to not be fully possessed and control if only by little Sukuna's powers. Now because of reasons Itadori has joined this magical high school where he needs to cooperate with the higher-ups to get the
                  rest of the fingers and to be killed after that.
The story has a nice balance of battles and dramas that keeps you engaged for the full run. In the vein of anime like Kimetsu no Yaiba or My Hero Academia it has a similar formula where our protagonist has serious power but also is handicapped by some device and also they have a superior mentor/companion that is like the safe card for the hardest moments. Jujutsu handles this mentor device not in the most elegant way as Goujo (the mentor) is always delegated to be far away from the action because of convenient reasons, and have the stakes at a healthy level, however, this falls as formulaic as it’s pretty notorious and that might be the worst enemy of the show. That’s not to say that you won’t have thrills, in more instances than I was expecting the story took me off guard and in the next moment I was rooting for a character or clenching my teeth because there was danger and maybe imminent death.
Getting aside the mentor formula, there is a lot to like and love from the Jujutsu, every character has a lot of charm both in design and personality, some of them might feel one-dimensional but there is always something extra to them that make them more complex and relatable. There is also a lot of comedy, great comedy that is, here and there so expect a good laugh or at very least a fun moment. Animation and the character design are great, the action scenes have a lot of weight and synergy so it is easy to feel many of the punches that are thrown, definitely one of this anime’s highlights.
Even when Jujutsu Kaisen has some of the tropes that I think would be the demise of this generation of Battle Shonen anime, it manages to stand out from the crowd, it has a unique appeal in design and themes that is hard to miss and I’m already pretty engaged of what will come next.",8,Uneducated_Revs

                This is the most 8-8.5 show I have seen
It's good, easy to follow, and overall very entertaining 
Characters are all quite unique and easily memorable, while the villains are quite average and not so deep
Animation and fight scenes are among the best out there, no complaints there
The main character is written nicely, he isn't a goody toushu or an arrogant prick, not blunt either, this makes him quite enjoyable and not irritable compare to many cliche shounen/seinen protagonists 
The story is simple, it has some good points and drive but all in all nothing too special
Soundtrack is fine, op and ed are ok 
But,
                  I will say that the show is way over hipped and I was quite disappointed in it as a whole, I binged it in 3 days as it didn't leave so much impression on me to do it faster (usually I binge shows of 24 ep in a couple of hours)

                Its only flaw is the lack of environmental/territorial relevance like in most Shonens (i.e. Bleach's Soul Society, Naruto's nations and villages,  One Piece's oceans, DBZ's planets/universes, etc.). We see the characters live their experiences in their ""city"", and nothing is particularly relevant about it. Be it a forest, a cave, a building, a street, a lake, a sewer, whatever it is, it was just a ""default"" setting; they're in the ""city"". The story never made any substantial use of the environment.
Other than that,
Action: It's denser in fights than any other Shonen I can think of. Practically every episode has fight(s). Its only direct competitor
                  is probably Baki. Only 5 episodes on 24 don't have any relevant fights (80% of the show basically).
Story: Classic humans vs bad spirits shonen. Spirit possession. A need to stop ""the evil at work"". A fear of the inevitable ""ultimate evil coming back to life"" and ruling the earth.
Art: The ""bad spirits"" have a different art-style, which gives it an accurate feel that they're different and to be feared. Incredibly well done animations. Satisfying attention to detail in every episode, be it a head tilt, a finger pointing someone, facial expressions.
Characters: Very typical Shonen. Nothing particularly note-worthy. Every cliché is present.
The best way to describe this anime is: Bleach + Naruto + Blue Exorcist

The first part of the anime feels like an almost undeniable hommage to Bleach, which is a plus.",10,WallahSous

But honest to god thats as far as I can give this show praise for. This show bored me so much the first few episodes were paced as if they were written for the flash, moving between things so quickly i had to rewind several times just to catch what the hell was going on. This show is carried by its visuals and gojou as
                  a character but the story, the other characters i just found annoying itadori is the most boring protagonist and his entire personality changes every other second, he makes no sense half the time and im not even gonna talk about proper deaths. fujigoro is your standard cold character that has no reaction to anything, and the other girl is stuck up but the only one in the show in my opinion that has interesting cursed techniques. the final episode with her and itadori fighting those brothers and she uses her technique it was genuinely a moment i liked everyone else techniques just feel like recycled powers from other shows. barely anything creative coming from jjk the plot is so boring i found myself dozing off or just not caring in the slightest. The enemys motivations make no sense the curses make no sense, idk dude mediocre anime, mediocre plot, bad characters, bad villians, good visuals.",6,notscottty

                When it comes to the new hit shows, Jujutsu Kaisen is an inevitable topic to come up. As one of the biggest running manga picked up by a huge studio like MAPPA, perhaps its quality was always ensured, yet the ensuing explosion of popularity in the show’s 24 episode run is unprecedented on a level not seen since Demon Slayer. Much like any show of the sort, the inevitable question always arises upon such a work’s rise in mainstream popularity; does it really live up to the hype as an actual good product? Long question short, I’d say yes, very much so.
Idly indulging in baseless
                  paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his days at either the clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this leisurely lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item. Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the ""King of Curses."" Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own newfound powers. Introduced to the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, he begins to walk down a path from which he cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer.
To begin with the most surface-level and obvious part of what makes Jujutsu Kaisen so great, the show is animated by Studio MAPPA. Anyone that has any experience in the anime scene, should immediately provide expectations for the sort of quality to be expected from the show. Jujutsu Kaisen sports some of the cleanest fights and most fluid animation I’ve seen in all my time watching anime, rivaled only by the likes of other giants like Demon Slayer or Attack on Titan. 
Beyond the simple quality of animation, the choreography is on a completely different level than most shows. Every movement and blow feel equal parts exhilarating and satisfying, accompanied by the banging soundtrack. Fights in this show are absolutely magical experiences that left me desperately watching them over and over and wanting more. 
A large part of what makes the show’s combat so gripping and entertaining is its excellent power system; cursed energy. Naruto has chakra, Hunter x Hunter Nen, Bleach spirit powers: Jujutsu Kaisen, as a modern shounen, is very much a product of these classic systems, taking the greatest parts of each to shape its own identity. What results is an intriguing and fascinating power system that defines its capabilities and limits, while also providing unique abilities in combat and room for further development and growth on the part of the cast.
On that subject, any good shounen thrives on its cast of characters that do all the punching and fighting, and Jujutsu Kaisen does not fail in that department. From the offset, Yuuji Itadori is an entertaining and fun main character that quickly shows himself to be a different sort of Shounen protagonist than the norm. Other main characters Megumi Fushigoro and Nobara Kugisaki contrast and compliment Yuuji in both interesting and entertaining manners through their personalities and stories, and Satoru Gojou is just an absolute legend. The entire cast of the show is just filled to the brim with personality, making every scene equal parts hilarious and gripping.
There’s a lot more than what I’ve discussed, but if the hype hasn’t sold you on Jujutsu Kaisen, maybe this review will help you make that decision. Overall, the show is just a very solid Shounen story with great characters and an intriguing power system, aided by the incredible fight choreography and animation provided by MAPPA. If that at all seems up your alley, I urge you to give the show a try. You won’t be disappointed!

                PROS:
-Extremely dynamic and well animated. The cream in terms of drawing.
-Nice soundtrack.
-Really cool and interresting characters. Even the enemies got a weird sympathetic charms.
-Just enough fans service.
-Feel fresh without reinventing the wheel
CONS:
-Without being particularly generic, some deja-vu vibes comes popping here and there.
-Really typical shonen, sometime a little too much. Don't take too much risk if any.
PERSONNAL NOTE:
When it started, i was scared it would turn out to be a Naruto clone (particularly because of the striking ressemblance between the two main teams). 
But the dynamic between the characters is completely different and at the end i'm not afraid to say than i'm rooting more for Itadori's teamates than those of Naruto.
Everyone is cocky, funny and most character don't take themself too seriously, making the whole watch more smooth and casual than most shonen.

                JJK was easily one of the most watched anime shows last year, helping it win Anime of The Year at the 2021 CR Anime Awards. But what were my thoughts on the show after watching the entire thing? Guess we'll figure out in this review.
So we are introduced to a world where curses are actually living things that can kill people if they are cursed, or just because. But the smart thing in this story is, that the only way to kill a curse is with a curse. Therefore we have the sorcerers that use jujutsu which is cursed energy and techniques to exorcise these
                  living curses that are born from peoples thoughts and feelings.
The story follows our main boy Itadori Yuji after he's devoured a cursed object which actually turns out to be the finger of the LORD OF THE CURSES, Sukuna, and his journey into becoming a sorcerer himself to help push back his own execution - yikes. 
Since this will be my first ever anime review, I want this one to set the tone for all the other reviews that are yet to come. Therefore I will now establish a few points I will discuss and go through in my reviews.
- Music (openings, endings + some thoughts on background music/fight music)
- Animation
- Overall plot/story
- Arcs
- Special or important scenes
- Characters (MC(s), antagonist(s), side characters)
- Power system
I will probably put more emphasis on characters, arcs, powers, scenes and plot since animation and music probably won’t have enough for me to talk about, but I still believe those are very crucial points to the overall enjoyment of an anime. 
So lets start with the basics: music. The first opening and ending are absolute bangers. The opening offers us some J-pop mixed with rock and it absolutely hypes you up to watch these characters from the opening, in the actual anime. The intro builds up to a great finale for the song, and it sets the right action mood.
And don't even get me started on the ending now. An ending with jazz-rap?? It's no shock that the ending won best ending during the 2021 awards either. It's very rare that any anime has such a strong lineup of an opening and ending that makes me want to listen to it all the way to the end, and even add it to my playlist. They added another opening and ending but to be honest, nothing is beating the original ones.
As far as the animation goes, I wasn't necessarily blown away like so many others were. I already knew of some of Mappa's animation because of AOT final season, but I wasn't blown away by that animation either. I don't think it has that many layers to it, I mean we see some shots of beautiful landscapes and the fight choreography is solid, but there is not a lot of super high-end 3D-like animation or angles that really blew me away, but then again - it doesn't need to, because that is not the portrayal they are going for here. But let me say this, the animation we got was super crisp and clean, and the way they can animate jujutsu domains with ease is awesome. 
A good anime and especially a Shonen needs some good characters, and JJK delivers just that. Starting off with our MC, Itadori Yuji is a guy with his heart in the right place. He is not too obnoxious or loud, and he is just the perfect amount of goofy but with strong morals. Add that on top of him possessing the king of the curses inside of him along with his raw natural strength, and you have a very very good MC with endless potential. 
Now the entire anime along with its characters have drawn a lot of parallels with Naruto. Nobara apparently reminds people of Sakura, Megumi reminds people of Sasuke and Gojo reminds people of Kakashi.
With that being said, what if I told you that the JJK characters are slightly better? Gojo is very clearly a much cooler character than Kakashi. He has major drip, a very well drawn character design and handsome looks + he is just a very likable dude with his incredibly funny goofy personality and his totally OP powers. He's the type of guy to kill villains but with class and style and a cute smile on his face - like how he was about to kill Jogo, just the entire build-up to their fight was classy.
You think Nobara reminds you of Sakura? Well be prepared to find out that Nobara actually can hold her own in several situations, and doesn't drool over somebody the entire time. She can actually do stuff. Her cursed techniques are very useful, her personality is proud, somewhat goofy a couple of times and just badass in general. She can get real angry and when she gets angry, please watch out. The last episode of the show just showed us all how crazy and merciless she can get. 
And now Megumi. He's the so-called Sasuke clone right? But he doesn't really have the same villainous personality that Sasuke starts growing. He might come off as a cold individual without a lot of feelings and a bit of reserved, but inside of him, he deeply cares for his peers. That is shown when he saves Yuji at the beginning of the show, and how he always makes sure to check if his comrades are okay. He's a complicated character that holds a lot of unrecognized potential he needs to tap into, but when he finally does, world better watch out. 
And not only the main characters are interesting, but the side characters are as well. Maki is a powerful cursed tool user, Todo is a loud and proud brute with a hilarious side when he decides Yuji is his now best friend, Panda is just a big ""panda"" that can fight and is incredibly mature and a smart individual, and then there's Toge that has his very own unique charm and powers. This show truly has a great variety of characters that are very likable. 
The overall story we got in the 1st season was okay. We have curses, people that exorcise curses and then we have *special* curses that want something bigger, how adoring. They made sure that there is a lot to still go through in the story, as it leaves a lot of questions to be asked. What's with the higher-ups that want to kill Yuji, among other things? What's with Gojo's incredible power level? What's up with the family clans? Will Yuji ever find all the fingers and die or will Sukuna take full control? Does Geto, Mahito etc. have any better motives to kill all humans and let curses live?
I am sure that most of our questions will be answered in due time, but I felt like I needed something more out of it, which is why I didn't think the first season was a masterpiece. It got repetitive and generic after a while with Yuji going out, teaming up with others, taking down curses and rinse and repeat. We didn't even get to see the full power of all the ""villains"", but that's maybe on purpose. They only decided to animate this portion of the manga because they want us to come back for more, which is smart. The action we got was fine, we had 1 or maybe 2 heart-wrenching moments, but overall I didn't think the story we got was that amazing. It's obviously always nice to follow the MC's and the side characters development, but I needed a bit more. There's a lot of room for more fully fledged out storylines, motives and important moments, but that doesn't mean that what we got was bad, at all.
Like I've already mentioned, the fighting was great. The back and forth between the characters and them on their own was nice to follow. 
So where does this rank our JJK in the new generation of Shonen? While it's probably better than MHA, I would still have Demon Slayer above it as for right now. There's just something about DS that makes it more intriguing to watch and follow than JJK. But remember, JJK is still on its first ever animated season, it has so much room to grow. It definitely has potential to be a top tier new-gen Shonen. 
As for the power system, I really liked it. Whenever a power system actually has some realistic thoughts and elements put into it, it always resonates with me. Turning your own feelings and thoughts into energy that can create immense power, weapons, techniques and several other things? Hell yeah! That's easily something I've always wanted to exercise in real life, turning my anger into something destructive when I need it - as much as it sounds like a perfect villain power to have, it's also a great hero power. The angrier you get, the more you can channel that into jujutsu and attack, but be careful! It takes great body and mind control to perfectly master this power, so there has to be some thought and logic put into how you use the cursed energy, so you don't end up letting your feelings get the best of you.
There is also the fact that with jujutsu you can pretty much imbue that into everything. Dolls, weapons, corpses. You can pretty much do everything and even create some incredible techniques. You can summon shikigami and use them for fighting, you can cast a veil to protect outsiders from damage and the knowledge of a jujutsu fight, you can manipulate the environment and your opponent with it and you can make these crazy domains in a fight where a hit is guaranteed. The entire power is amazing to watch, the opportunities are endless!
As I've also mentioned before, the story can get a bit repetitive and therefore most of the arcs fall under that category. The ones that mainly stick out to me are the Vs. Mahito arc and the Kyoto Goodwill Event arc. These two arcs is also where we witness the best scenes from the anime, at least in my opinion.
Vs. Mahito arc shows a face-off between one of the biggest villains we are introduced to in the story, against our MC. This arc ultimately makes them enemies for life, and it serves as the build-up to what we can expect is going to be one of the biggest fights one day. 
It also gives us the most heart-breaking scene of the show. Junpei, a boy that has been teased in the opening to be somewhat close to Yuji, gets a very very sad ending.
 He's introduced as a poor soul that is being bullied on the regular, eventually making him fill up his heart with hate as he becomes friends with an unlikely character - Mahito. One of the villains. Mahito uses Junpei's anger to manipulate him into being his jujutsu sorcerer pawn. Yuji meets Junpei and they kick it off immediately, but it is already too late. As Mahito along with Geto - another villain, secretly curse Junpei's mother and has her killed. This ends up becoming too much for sweet Junpei as he succumbs to Mahito's manipulation and goes over to the dark side, forcing him to fight against his new friend, Yuji.
Yuji tries to do whatever he can to help Junpei snap out of his hatred, and he almost succeeds. That is until Mahito eventually betrays Junpei and turns him into a cursed spirit, killing him in the process. This forces our MC to kill Junpei's cursed spirit, making a very very sad scene where we all were left with a ""Junpei deserves better"". But without this event, Yuji wouldn't have the same huge determination to kill Mahito and make him his mortal enemy, setting up a great rivalry. 
The Kyoto Goodwill Event arc is my favorite though. What is set up as a simple and awesome school vs school competition, turns into an all-out battle royal because the Kyoto students are tasked with killing Yuji, but the Tokyo students want to save Yuji. Therefore it becomes a huge battle between both schools students where they all showcase their great and interesting powers. 
But their fighting ends quickly because a special grade curse named Hanami breaks into the school grounds, looking for trouble as a part of a bigger plot by the villains. Most of the students try to fight it, only to be left injured as they were unable to defeat it. Only 2 guys can come close enough, Kyoto's top grade 1 sorcerer student Todo with his huge abs and brute personality, and his new ""BESTO FRIENDO"" Itadori Yuji! They started off as a battle pairing in the ""battle royal"" event, but eventually Todo is so intrigued by Yuji (and his taste in women) that in the heat of the battle, decides to become his teacher and teach him how to fully control his cursed energy while they fight each other and then team up against the villain, Hanami.
Their 2 vs 1 fight had arguably the best fighting choreography in the show and it leaves you in awe with how tough and ice cold Yuji and Todo were together, almost defeating Hanami, but sadly Hanami gets away in time before he is blasted away by one of Gojo-Sensei's special attacks. 
Taking everything into consideration, I understand why this anime was so hyped in 2021. Having the right mix of characters, animation, music, fight-scenes and power system makes for a great anime. Thats also why I gave this a 8/10. I genuinely enjoyed following my boy Yuji along with his friends and the drippy Gojo-Sensei in their quest to save humanity from curses. I was intrigued enough to want more and I am excited to see how Mappa are going to animate the next arcs.
 Since I haven't come around to read the manga yet, my hopes for the next arcs would be more of a fully fledged out story where we dive deeper into some individual characters and their backstories, also I'm hoping for some more big fights where not only Yuji, Megumi and Nobara are fighting, but way more people!
Sorry for the huge length of my review, I tend to not stop once I have unlimited characters to type and when I am passionate about something!",8,AndyVintage

                I binged it in 3 days. That's about all you need to know. I was really reticent to try this because of all the fanboyism. I shouldn't have been worried. This is like a grown up Naruto without all the fluff. And while there are some tropey flashbacks to previous episodes or even things in the same episode, it is kept to a minimum. There is a baseball episode, as does all modern world shonen anime, and it is actually fantastic. Highly recommend. It's on par with Demon Slayer in animation quality with truly beautiful fluid fight scenes. The music is supportive but not overly
                  outstanding with some memorable themes throughout. The voice actors do a great job here.",9,gunslingefry

                I already wrote a review for the manga so I'll focus on the stuff I didn't talk about in my prior review. 
Honestly, it's a huge bummer that Jujutsu Kaisen's anime ended right when the garbage part of the story ended. Seriously, if I didn't know that it got any better, I'd be sure to rank this along with Demon Slayer for most generic shounen plot ever.
Let's be honest though, alongside the similarities with Demon Slayer for its shounen trope filled plot also comes the similarity of good animation and fights. Is it better than Demon slayer? Perhaps not, but there are a ton of
                  fights in this show, all of which have quite good choreography and animation. Just the sheer amount of fights and good quality ones warrants me to already rate this quite high. I really was surprised at the production value. Definitely better than Attack on Titan Final season despite being produced by the same studio. No garbage CGI for major fights and they aren't short 5 second scenes, either. Absolutely nothing to complain about for the animation and art quality. Sure, I can nitpick about how the backgrounds in some of the fights are CGI'd but they're quite decent and high quality.
As for the story? Yeah, it sucks. We all know it sucks. The story is garbage. Collect all the 20 fingers! Collect the 7 dragon balls. Yeah, that's funny.   The story doesn't really get any better either, but at least individual arcs become interesting because of how the focus of the story goes off of the boring main cast of characters and into interesting side characters that aren't generic as all hell. I can't stress how badly the anime ended since this anime perfectly adapts the worst parts of the story.
What about characters? Yeah, something tells me a generic vanilla OP MC protagonist with a nearly immortal body and a demon sealed within him while also possessing and super strength while also possessing quick learning ability isn't very special in my eyes. Seriously, his motivation for fighting is to ""have proper deaths"" and it's not even his own wish but rather, his grandfather's? So weak. Fushigoro isn't much better. His goals are flimsily and his backstory is a weak, generic supplement to his character in order to infuse any sort of personality into the anime without any actual characterization or investment into his character. Weak. Kugisaki on the other hand, is definitely the most interesting character. There's no dumb tragic backstory for her motivation, but it's a more realistic and just kind of a depressing story of why she wants to go to Tokyo. Overall, the best, but also, not a lot of time is spent on her at all. As a result, she's pretty weak anyway, not much better than the other two characters.  7:3 sorcerer is also good.  Why? For the same reason as Kugisaki's. It's not some generic boiler plate sob story, but it's a more realistic backstory with some somber tones to it. Overall, I sure as hell like these more than those generic sob stories. Less  tragedy, more realization and perspective on life without the plot device crutch of a super tragic event. What about Maki and Mai's backstory? It doesn't even make a lot of sense, and their character dynamics and relationship could have been handled with a lot more finesse and complexity, but you're just introduced to them quickly and you understand where they stand nearly instantly. That is precisely what's wrong with all of these characters. You're laid bare to a boring exposition revealing their motivations and you're expecting to care about the character as a result? Seems kind of counterintuitive, don't you think? 
Jujutsu Kaisen also kind of falls into the ""edgy"" theme trap a bit. Not that much that it's unbearable, but the show tries to analyze morality while also barely scratching the surface, making the theme extremely shallow and childish. Curses = bad. Human = good. Well, this is fine. Good vs bad, it happens all the time, and it's well done a lot of the time. The problem is after. Why would Jujutsu Kaisen try to incorporate more moral themes when it's never touched upon ever again and it's rushed as all hell? Just don't touch upon it at all. It introduces a rushed arc about a guy who got bullied and him taking revenge on his bullies, essentially, but you're never given a true response about Yuuji dealing with ""bad humans."" What, so if a curse murders a human, that's a death sentence because remember, curse = bad. But, if a human murders a human, then you still have to spare them since they still have good in them! Look, the school implemented anti-bullying policies. People can reform!!!! After all, Yuji's response to not having any guilty conscience is that ""well, they're curses, they're bad."" Ok, I don't really care that curses are inherently evil, but you already established that fact. Why did you have to drag me on a random arc about it? Sure, I understand that it was just a joke of an arc meant to ""make Yuuji's convictions"" strong. Cringe.
I was thinking that there was no way that I was actually going to like this season of Jujutsu Kaisen. The beginning was that bad! In fact, I had to sit through the garbage plots and subplots that I skimmed or quickly read over in the manga that were oh so terrible. This revitalized and reinvigorated my hatred for the lack of any substantial characters and story that Jujutsu Kaisen has. It forced me to watch how terribly the beginning turned out. Just the fact that I managed to still enjoy myself just proves how good the animation quality is. The good animation managed to keep me hooked on the garbage plot. I even got goosebumps in one of the fights. I would have rated this much lower if not for the anticipation of the future seasons to come. It'll probably never be an all time great because of the horrific beginning and terrible MC, but the story arcs do significantly rise in quality literally right after.",7,PixelB

                WOOOO I love this Shonen! It's rare to see an anime actually give women respect and power, and part of me saying there is respect is that I saw no sexualization of the characters. Sure, some of the guys talk about preferences but it's extremely tame and doesn't take away from the female cast. Though just because a show gives equal footing to it's ladies that doesn't mean it's a good show- 
This still is. The main cast is very like-able with just a few running gags that you can call as soon as they start, the characters have great chemistry and you don't just
                  see them fighting each other, or fawning over another, in fact, as far as I've seen there is no romance in the show, and having women in the show that is just so rare. I can't stress enough just how tired I am of seeing certain tropes and this show just doesn't give them a platform, BLESS. *ahem* I digress. The fight scenes are AMAZING with Mappa at the helm, who I believe is a sister company to Madhouse, they have done nothing but wow me with every show I've seen of there. There are moments where things are sketchy but it reminds me of yuri on ice where they try to show as much movement as they can, and these are moments. Most of the fight scenes are AMAZING and jaw dropping. Unique areas where there is so much detail and movement it's not a show you can have on and listen to, you need to watch it!
Some of the shonen moments are you know, talking during fights, internal monologues that don't need to be as long as they are, and over explaining abilities *however* there is a lot of set up and if feels like the next season they aren't going to be explaining as much. 
They have the tried and true school competition that is required in most shonens. I will say, that though I'm not a huge fan of those, it really show cases a lot of the different characters abilities and back stories, pros and cons to this, I didn't need everyone's back stories from the get go, I think they could have held out on showing some of them, but it really feels like all of these stories tie together, there's running themes in the show and I like that everyone has something they can relate to, which I'm sure will play a huge part in the story later. 
All in all, worth your time! Also the original intro outro SLAPS.",9,Banisoup

                Story 7:
It is a great story but nothing out of the ordinary. 
We have the main character, Itadori, who is trying to save people and thus lead people to a propper death and much like Itadory, every character has their own reasons why they are saving/murdering people. 
The power-system is similar to HunterxHunter where Jujutsu Kaisen uses cursed energy, and HunterxHunter uses nen. In both power-systems, it is possible to counter others based on their cursed energy and nen which I think is fine.
Art 9:
The art style is amazing and it almost looks like every frame, is a keyframe. It almost looks like Kyoto studios
                  made this anime. In jujutsu kaisen they do not have a specific scene or moment where the art was memorable or ""over the top"".
Sound 7:
Cannot remember the soundtracks which are not negative or positive. 
Their openings and endings are memorable and thus I give it a 7.
Character 9:
Almost every character is unique which helps every character to have a personality. Every character has their own unique backgrounds, abilities, skills, humor, and different ideology. Especially Gojo since he is one of the most powerful characters, but is also the most chill. It is funny to see the strongest character be on the good side and not the evil side.  
Enjoyment 9:
Every episode is unique and entertaining. When they fight or when they explore/learn it is always exciting. 
Overall 8:
Overall this is still a typical shonen anime where the story has been seen before in many different ways whereas a story like Death Note is very unique. With that being said it still contains great characters, some great animation, and gives you a great time when you watch it.
It is not minded blowing or revelationary but it is a good try and a very respectable try. 
Storys like Death Note and Psycho-Pass have the greatest stories. They are unique, revolutionary, and mind-blowing. Storys like Attack on Titans are not unique nor revolutionary but are really well made with no plot holes where it all makes sense, which I believe, should be Jujutsu Kaisens goal.",8,Duhn
40748,"
                Jujutsu deserved to have won anime of the year, definitely not, deserved to have won better villain, not definitely, but this anime has many things to appreciate.
Jujutsu was in fact an anime that generated a lot of hype, especially with the release of Kimetsu that made the audience pay more attention to fighting shonens with beautiful animation and cool characters. Yes, Jujutsu has it all, breathtaking animation (so good it doesn't even make sense, Kimetsu made the ufotable investigated for deflecting tax to have a slightly better animation), and extremely good openings and ending; I personally think the second ending is better because it is
                  more touching, but in the context of Jujutsu in fact the first is better, but as for the openings I prefer the first since I love E ve.
As for the animation in particular I have nothing to complain about, excellent in ""slice of life"" moments, as well as in fights, but there is something that makes me a little nervous with Jujutsu that is not even from the anime, but from the manga, the scenarios. These scenarios are very bland and half empty, yes I know it is a forest, but it is kind of strange that there is no tree and it seems to have a stage in the middle of the forest (I didn’t get a point, so I did because the 3D of the scenery was bothering, but nothing big, it's just my bad opinion).
As for the characters I’ll share, because it’s easier for me:
Itadori, Yuuji: Tíco protagonist of shonen, with nothing that makes him different from others, has giant potential, ease in making friends, likes to punch and that's all. Yes, he has some funny scenes and his interactions with Todou are excellent. I feel that they will develop more, but as for this season, nothing much. His potential irritates me, being a beginner and being so good is a mistake of many shonens, I imagine. His episodes with Junpei are excellent, in fact, Junpei best boy.
Ryoumen, Sukuna: I think he's my favorite character, but I definitely don't think he deserved a better villain, after all he isn't even a villain. He is just an enemy of the future that serves to generate funny scenes or force development in the characters, that is, I believe that this season at least, he is not even a villain. It's just my favorite because I love any kind of ""Venon and Eddie"" interaction.
Fushiguro, Megumi: The typical ""big brother"", fun character, has my favorite power. Although the last episodes delve a little deeper into him, I still think that he is not a big deal, yes he is funny, I loved him, but there is nothing that makes him stand out as a character (like most Jujutsu). I believe that future seasons will develop it better.
Kugisaki, Nobara: Undoubtedly one of the best women in anime, super strong and incredible, capable of generating funny scenes regardless of who she is interacting with. There is a vibe of ""little sister, but if you want I will blow you up"". I believe that future seasons will develop it a lot.
Gojou, Satoru- Pfft, I don't know why they like him, he's just a pretty face with one of my favorite VAs. Typical super strong character with a sexy voice, capable of exploding and stealing hearts. Only it has the same character depth as a children's pool.
Toudou, Aoi- I will ignore their colleagues, but I make it clear that everyone has very good backstoryes, especially Mechamaru. Todou undoubtedly prevented me from dropping Jujutsu, with his super intense charisma and very good interactions with Yuuji. Simply MY BESTO FRIENDO (in fact my taste for women is the same as for Fushiguro, it can even be a man, as long as you have a good heart, it's great.
Supporting and Inumaki + Mai- All supporting characters are excellent, some of them having details that I find more interesting than many details of the main trio. As an example, Mai and Inumaki, since I really want to hear about her family and Inumaki's voice.
Mahito's gang- Honestly, I found everyone uninteresting without being Mahito. His gang has something that reminds me of the HxH Phantom troupe, only with 2 interesting characters. This thing would be the fact that they do things because they are practical, as an example: Because we have meetings with villains in a perched and dark place like a warehouse, we can do it on the beach; or so that we can discuss plans in our free time, we can play Monopoly (I associated due to the fact that the Phantom Troupe rides on a train). But for the rest I love Mahito's personality, very good for a ""villain"" since the other 3, I am not honestly interested.
Miwa, Kasumi- Best girl, you are not useless.
Finally, Jujutsu is really fun, it is worth watching, as he knows how to use concepts from other shonens very well.

                To start of, I fucking loved it. Its fucking awesome. I first watched it when it was half-way done, but temporarily dropped it due to the fact that I don’t want to wait a week for the next episode. My initial thoughts were, “oh cool art and setting, nothing really new and the humor is sometimes a little forced, but it do be cool”. I later found out that I was just not in the mood to watch anything, hence ultimately failed to see the critical points and genuinely funny jokes. I recently binged it from episode one, and I saw it in a different
                  light. 
What I most loved about this anime was its ability to fully immerse me into the setting. The plot itself was immersive and the setting was an altered reality of modern japan, with occasional traditional aspects. I was brought to a very different, yet morally relatable universe, each time I watch a new episode. I fully forget my responsibilities when watching (don’t please) and feel like a first year student at Jujutsu Tech High interacting with the other characters. So if you’re looking for a universe to get sucked in, I recommend this. 
Speaking of characters, another thing I liked about jjk was the interesting characters and their individual philosophies in life, which ultimately encompasses the idea of working with each other despite their differences. The traditional hierarchy of power amongst the top clans, the unrealistic standards given to women, the lack of fuck given by Maki and Kugisaki (which i fucking love), the choice of gojo to utilize education instead of outright agression, Megumi’s decision to selectively save people, and Junpei’s damaged disposition due to trauma (there are a lot more but it will take too long to enumerate and explain each on so yeah, no), are all exaggerated reflections of human nature. The point of the philosophy was delivered in such a way that it doesn’t seem regurgitated. 
The third thing I liked about this was the unique powers. Like damn, not only were they visually pleasing and overall interesting, they were also based on theories of quantum physics, particularly the concepts of space and infinity—which is sick as fuck for someone like me who studies physics and like anime. Gege Akutami must have been a nerd and i live for it <33 Moreover, there’s also the mystery of the connection between the brain and cursed energy itself, as mentioned by ieri—which is reflects how mysterious the human brain actually is, even in the context of reality (not sure if explained in the manga; yet to read). So if you're into that, again I recommend this. 
Other factors I really appreciated were the music and art. I mean fantastic job MAPPA. The art was gorgeous and intricate, and the varying point of views during fight scenes were just breathtaking. Especially the last two episodes, man, the alternating frames between Yuuji and Kugisaki plus the metal music is just pure rapture. Not to mention Megumi’s incomplete domain expansion scene. The animation perfectly executed his temporarily triggered insanity. Oh and lets not forget Gojo’s insanely well animated nonstandard episode. For the music, the entire soundtrack of jjk just all together slaps.
After binging the series, i can say that it’s probably the best anime of 2020.  It was a really fun experience. However, if you’re expecting something non-generic and psychologically stimulating, don’t. I mean there are certainly psychological factors, but it doesn’t really lean much on that genre. It’s definitely a typical shounen, but it has so much to offer. So if you’re someone like me who enjoys shounen cliches and dry humour, Jujutsu Kaisen is definitely for you. 
PS. the end credits were also a a huge factor, though not all of them are funny, some were stupidly hilarious.",9,hokageyamz

                Jujutsu Kaisen is an amazing action and psychological anime. To be honest, I don't generally like all action shows, however the animation in this is so captivating that it has me very interested. Not to mention the character designs are so well made. The storyline is interesting and had me intrigued from the first episode I watched it. Also, watching the mixture of different characters come together is super enjoyable. With action in almost every episode, if you enjoy action you will most definitely enjoy Jujutsu Kaisen. 
There hasn't been a ton of character development as of yet because there is only one season out,
                  but I intend to watch any more seasons that come out to see what happens. It is not a groundbreaking anime in the sense of complexity, but it is groundbreaking in the sense of animation, characters, and overall interest.",9,jamaycanmecrazy

Jujutsu Kaisen was one of the most hyped animes of 2020. I had expected a lot from it but sadly, I'm disappointed. 
------------------ THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONWARDS --------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Firstly, the story is a typical shounen and the MC is a high schooler. As we've always known there's at least one goofy guy in shounen animes and in this anime, our MC Itadori Yujii players the role and he plays it well ngl. But that's about all for him which is going in the right direction. He ends to swallowing a first-grade cursed
                  item to save a jujutsu sorcerer from getting killed! WHAT?! 
In the anime, Itadori is rarely seen training and in a fight with Toudou, he gets a first-grade attack down on the first try. WHAT AGAIN? IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT? WITHOUT TRAINING? As if that was not enough, he goes around knocking down first-grade curses like they're nothing and in the last episode, he's seen being recommended to be promoted to a first-grade jujutsu sorcerer. Talk about being overpowered seeesh! 
The plot is no good either. There are massive plot holes because of which I didn't quite enjoy watching the show as much as I thought I would. Many things were left unexplained. There's no explanation behind Itadori's super strength and speed. But let's just say he was born that way.
It was mentioned that being a vessel of a curse such as Sukuna is extremely rare but it has not been explained why Itadori is compatible with Sukuna. Because it is a rare occurrence, all the more reasons it should be backed up by explanations.
Episode 13:
How did Mihito end up in Sukuna's ""mind"" or whatever that's called after Itadori broke into Mihito's domain expansion when Itadori himself did not use domain expansion nor did he swap with Sukuna?
Without this, Nanami would be dead. Plot armor? 
These are just a few of many problems with the plot. 
The characters are all well crafted and individualistic. They all have a story to tell. It's refreshing how they all, in the same situation, take things differently and handle them differently. 
The animation is top-notch. I'm all for Satoru Gojo's sexy eyes uwu.

                Contains a bit of spoiler. 
I'm someone who was spoiled about this whole show, I'd be lying if I said that, that didn't decrease the enjoyment but to be honest, it was lesser than I expected to be. I knew of the skills of the more famous characters and a vague idea of how the story was going to flow but my enjoyment was still very high. 
Let's start with the plot. So Gege (the mangaka) has mentioned before that he was inspired by older anime and among those was Naruto. I know, I know, you're all maybe gonna attack me for this but this
                  anime reminds me so much of Naruto...not in a bad way. Cause let's be honest, there was a lot of element that really does resemble Naruto...
(e.g., Sukuna is to Yuuji as Kurama is to Naruto, cursed energy works similarly to chakra, literally Yuuji, Megumi and Nobara is Team 7 in Naruto, Sasuke is literally one of the biggest models for Megumi - describe the two of them without mentioning cursed techniques or chakra/ninja and you can easily mistake one for the other: dark haired, teenager, has daddy issues, has sibling issues, a tsundere for the MC, desires to grow stronger and catch to the MC) 
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with these similarities because Naruto is indeed an inspiration to this show and other shows as well. Also, JJK was able to grow out of that inspiration and despite the similarities, the two shows are distinct from each other. I also heard the manga would establish that distinction more. 
Anyway onto the next point...
This is a shounen anime and the plot gives you exactly that, hence why I gave it a 7 (could even go up to an 8 tbh). The story is typical, you can predict what's going to happen, it's a standard shounen that gives you what you expect from a shounen anime and that's the reason why it's good. A shounen anime is about the action, the protagonist's journey, the annoying antagonists, the interesting supporting characters, the power scaling, etc., and JJK gives you all of that interestingly. It's an anime that gets you hooked to it. 
I do have to appreciate though that with the enjoyable plot, the characters give so much support to it. I have to give extra appreciation to the female characters created by Gege. It's not a secret that female characters in shounen somehow gets depicted as those 'weak' ones or at least they're only strong in the beginning then gets trashy in the end. If Sakura was only introduced in the same way Nobara or Maki was introduced, she wouldn't have a ton of haters as she does now even after more than a decade has passed since the anime's debut. 
Also the power scaling also makes more sense in this anime. There's a clear distinction of who are the weak and who are the strong characters in this show and that's better in my opinion. Instead of introducing 'strong' characters that only gets sht on as the story progresses to make the main characters look better, it's better if there's already clear differences between their powers and capabilities. It gives more diversity to the world that is being built. 
There are a lot of questions that are still not answered but I wouldn't mind those right now with this season because this is the FIRST FCKING SEASON. It's literally an introduction, the problem with those unanswered questions will be serious if the following seasons won't be able to clear them out. An example of those questions I expect to be answered would be: ""Why tf is Yuuji able to be a vessel for Sukuna?"" 
To those reviewing that JJK is sht because there's so many confusing stuff, this situation is literally similar to AOT, remember in S1 when people said it was boring and just about Titans? Well here we now in the Final Season, where all those questions about the fcking basement was answered. 
I could write so much more but I'm typing this at night and my brain just couldn't. With the last episode though I am kinda inclined to proceed with the manga given that it's going to be a while for Season 2. 
To end, JJK is a good shounen anime. 
Is it overhyped? No, cause it actually is a good show. 
Is it the best shounen anime? No. If someone says that then that's the time JJK is what we can call 'overrated'. 
It's a good shounen but it's not the best. However, it does deserve the praise it's getting because IT IS  a good watch.",7,_blxnk

                Jujutsu Kaisen is blowing up in popularity to the point where people are comparing it to the other supernatural shonen hit Demon Slayer. Honestly I think the show's gorgeous animation and sound design are winning people over so much that they can ignore the kind of mediocre writing. Personally I enjoyed the show a lot but less than others on here. If Demon Slayer was 9.5/10 then I think Jujutsu Kaisen deserves more like an 8/10 overall. 
The story in JJK is bare bones basic shonen. The main character is a Good Boy who agrees to trap a demon inside of him so he can
                  save his friends. He uses his magic to fight demons and he goes to a school for other demon hunting teens with magic weapons, all while learning to control the demonic split personality inside him. Hmm, this is all sounding awfully familiar isn't it? I only noticed this over time, but I also have to complain about the fact that no one really ever dies on this show? Like Gojo beats the hell out of that volcano-head curse, reduces him to just a head, and then he's saved at the last minute. After that there were two more instances where Yuji and an ally teamed up to beat the big bad 99.9% but then he just slithers away at the last second. It's like come on, man! Don't any of the villains ever die? Hell, the main character even ""dies"" and comes back pretty quick! 5/10
Studio Mappa have truly outdone themselves in the art/animation department. Fight sequences are so well choreographed that my jaw almost dropped. The visuals are so gorgeous, especially certain shots in the OP. I especially loved the look of the various demons in the show and how they had this ""chalky"" outline to them that other character designs did not have. Really the only other shonen whose visuals can compete is the aforementioned Demon Slayer. 10/10
Sound design in JJK is similarly stellar. Rock music plays at key moments during fights to really pump you up. Oh and that 1st OP is such a banger. I listen to it all the time even when I'm not watching the show! 10/10
I have to complain about the subpar characters. There is, for example, absolutely nothing striking or memorable about Yuji as a main character. He is every shonen protagonist ever. I'd say the show does a much better job with making its side characters likable and memorable. My favorite was the blue haired samurai girl (Useless Miwa). Many have pointed this out so I need to mention that I agree that the main trio here is like an improved version of Naruto's team. Yuji is a less annoying Naruto (even has a demon inside him), Gojo is Kakashi 2.0 (gray haired fun sensei but HE COVER BOTH EYES), Fushiguro is a more friendly Sasuke, and Nobara is like if Sakura actually pulled her own weight on the team. Nobara is a bitchy tomboy like Sakura, sure, but she does more in 24 episodes of JJK than Sakura did in 200+ episodes of Naruto (zero hyperbole here)! Seriously I loved her. I also liked how Nobara was a bit stockier than your average female main character, who tends to have a ""Barbie doll"" shape. 6/10
Yes, I complained about subpar writing, story and characters in this show. So you'll be shocked when I say my personal enjoyment bumped this series up to a surprising 8/10 overall. Enjoyment is hard to quantify but I just got so wrapped up in the creepy designs of the demons and the god-tier fight scenes that my enjoyment was at a strong 8/10 because I could ignore the flaws in those moments.",8,WhiteWolfKiba

                So I'm writing this review now but it has been awhile since I watched the show (like 5 months) but I do remember most of it.
How much you're going to enjoy this show depends on your taste, obviously, and I personally didn't enjoy Jujutsu Kaisen at all.
The characters are basic and probably the least innovative character personalities ever.
The story is also pretty much the same as the characters, basic. Now, the show does look like it has a high budget so you're going to enjoy some good art and animations, but that's it. 
The thing is, I didn't know I watched 20/24 episodes, I actually
                  came back to rewatch the whole thing so I can watch the movie at the cinema, and I dropped the show in the first place because it was kinda boring but I was sure I was going to rewatch it and it was going to get better, but it turns out I watched 20/24 episodes which makes me think its INSANE that this show got over 8/10 here.",5,EvilEye69

                I finally decided to make a review on this anime. I dont remember exactly everything about the anime but im going to review what i remember. Disclaimer im biased
So the story of the anime is pretty decent even tho its a bit creepy at some point. Id like to point out that the story is not yet finished so i can't exactly rate it because the end of the story may destroy the whole anime. The concept of the anime is similar to bleach, another anime that I like ( The sorcerers destroy curses the same as soul reapers destroy hollows)
The music was very good
                  (I personally enjoyed gojo's theme the most) but every song in the anime is great.
The characters in the show were pretty nice with cool personalities. I dont really judge an anime by the character developing so i can't really discuss about it. All I can say is that i enjoyed gojo's personality because its very similar to urahara's personality from Bleach. 
I enjoy Bleach alot so this anime is very good for me.
Overall Id like to say that this anime might be considered a masterpiece by some people (including me) or a trash and overhyped anime by other people. I respect your opinion and I hope you find this review helpful.",10,GOJOFAN01

                TLDR: There is a lot of build up, character, plot, and worldbuilding wise, and when those come together and it explodes, the high moments are definitely worth it with strong characters to make the journey feel ever the more satisfying. Please give us a season two and not just a prequel movie. 
STORY: I feel like I've seen a lot of ""teenage badasses fights evil-manifestations"" to struggle to be fully engaged by Jujutsu's basic plot. I like how there's an overarching plot brewing, but it feels a little too far in the background for me to feel immediate urgency. What really made Jujutsu's plot interesting
                  for me was the idea that the main protagonist was also the ultimate villain. Sukuna being part of Yuji and the associated morally ambiguous conflicts that brews is definitely my favorite part of the story. 
CHARACTERS: What really makes Jujutsu's characters, especially its main cast, stand out is the sheer level of character development. Yuji faces ideological questions and must confront them to move forward. Megumi's growing fighting prowess is absolutely incredible (and very satisfying) to behold. Nobara didn't get as much of an arc yet to me, but she has been built as a strong and very capable character and I'm very excited to see how it goes. Gojo is amazing, and everyone knows that. The show also spends a lot of time establishing the other students, and while I do like several of them (Maki, Miwa, Inumaki), I have yet to see the character building pay off. Here's hopes for a season 2. 
PRESENTATION: MAPPA went *out* animating this show. I can't believe part of it aired the same season as Attack on Titan because the detail, flow, and choreography is just top notch without a dip in quality. Every single fight scene is an absolute delight, even more so if Gojo is part of it. The soundtrack does its job very well, though perhaps only a few tracks really stand out on their own. Openings wise, Kaitai Kitan I think has smoother visuals and symbols, but VIVID VICE builds atmosphere and hype better. 
ENJOYMENT: Maybe the hype surrounding the show set my expectations up too high, but for most of the show I felt like I was missing something. I feel like I'm not getting the ""oopmh"" people were saying it has. I think part of it could be the pacing, especially with the group fight in the second half of the show. I felt that the group battle between the schools was on the slower side of pacing, even if I did appreciate the character building. I didn't find this show absolutely amazing until the last three episodes with a tight plot, character growth, and amazing action sequences. Still, I had a great time throughout the show. Also do not skip on out the funny post credit scenes. They're worth it.",9,PanJean17

                Jujutsu Kaisen (TV) for me this anime was like a trip to the top of Everest and put the flag successfully, really this is a ten and I amito that has a 70% cliché but everything is well taken care of that you forget about those drawbacks examples the animation a 10 the implementation of 2d a success plus the CGI moments that left it to animate the powers and certain parts of the brutal fights and I also recommend seeing it when the version dubbed into Spanish comes out that is very close to being released.
Characters: all the original designs are interesting, personal stories
                  and surprising motivations the villains are the best of the season the most generic was the story of the twins and that many can complain is the 100% cliché protagonist but their motivations and rhythm improve to each chapter you can sympathize with the characters.
Music: the successful OP 1 and 2 immerse you in the anime and leave you asking for more, I recommend the full version and ED 1 and 2 represented the characters very well, eating more of the 1 but I would have put a pop rock or a pop with a stronger beat for the end.",10,Elias21

                I remembering seeing the trailers for this anime when it first came out... Man, was I impressed and did it ever get my hyped! BEST OF ALL, that hype was never let down once (not even during the baseball episode!). Let's get right into the anime basics.
***SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS***
Story; Itadori Yuuji, a regular high-schooler (with abnormal strength) liked to hang out at the occult club at his school or by his grandfathers side at the hospital. One thing after the other, Itadori is thrown into situations where he has to think fast (which he isn't to bad at... but sometimes is a little careless). Dead
                  grandpa, friends in danger, curses and cursed objects and how much they can harm the every day life of humans. Itadori walks into this world with no knowledge, but with the will of wanting to protect, help and make sure ordinary people can live their lives in peace. You'll get introduced to curse users, called Jujutsu Sorcerers, a crazy high-school that teaches them how to control/wield their powers and a whole bunch of live Curses you wouldn't even expect! Art; whether it was the fighting, eating, hilarious Jujutsu scroll or sappy scene's they all looked GORGEOUS!!! Sound; If you didn't enjoy the OST from this series then I believe their might be something wrong with you... very strong opinion on my end, but GOD DAMN did I love it. Characters; So many twists and turns with the relationships in the anime. Bonds that weren't able to come together, friendships like no other, losing people the closest to... ahhh, my god damn heart *wipes tear from eye*.
OVERALL, the first season of Jujutsu was god damn FANTASTIC!!! Worth the hype, 24 episodes and a wait for a second season AFTER we get to have a brilliant movie (learning about the Yuuta Okkotsu and possibly why he's so god damn strong).
Adding this manga to my reading list... I have a feeling I won't ever be able to get to them all, haha!",9,giraffenanime

                This was the best Shounen anime i've watched so far. the character build-up is very smooth and is linear. No where I felt like that 'this was a bit too much'. the storyline is excellent and fights are just top-notch. Each character has their own unique set of abilities and uniqueness even though the main character is the most powerful. all the characters look good lookwise, the artwork is just awesome too!. It's not that long and I never got bored watching any episode, it never failed to keep me at the edge. Overall it's a 9/10.
This anime also portrays the power of friendship which
                  is a good message. another good message which I took was that it says to fight till you die, i.e., never give up in your life. fight for your own good and be a little greedy and use your full power if you want to win, which is in my opinion a great message to people who lack motivation.",9,SenpaiAmoghus

                Jujutsu Kaisen was very entertaining but I do have some gripes. The animation was nothing short of spectacular. The dynamic action scenes were extremely entertaining and had a lot of good shots. The dark colors fit well with the nature of the curses. A lot of the character designs were simple but streamlined. The soundtrack was amazing and always pumped me for the fights. Especially the first OP by Eve. I'm glad a lot more people have taken notice of him now, he deserves it. The characters themselves are pretty good. Some of them don't get enough screentime for me to really form an opinion
                  but I have a feeling that they could become beloved given more time. I really like how the main three play off of each other. They can be genuinely hilarious. I'm glad that they're just pals and that there isn't some stupid love triangle between them, they just hang out and do teen stuff and sometimes beat the crap out of ghosts. It's refreshing compared to a lot of shounen. Gojo is the absolute best little shit and I love him. I want him to take his blindfold off and just stare at me for a while. The villains were kinda interesting, I wasn't super into them but the main guy's power was pretty cool. I really wish Sukuna had some more time or something. He's a big plot point but he hardly ever comes out or talks really. I wish he could have at least been more of a commentator. I do like his relationship with Yuuji. Yuuji just doesn't really care and the nonchalant way he deals with him is pretty funny. My main beef is just with the plot. It's VERY standard. This doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, but when you've seen so many similar shows it's hard to get genuinely intrigued or excited. It's just predictable from start to finish. I think this anime will be a much bigger hit with new fans or casual fans than with hardcore anime fanatics. Overall, it is completely worth watching and I would recommend it to anyone looking for good shounen.",8,LeachieGekuu

                Since I've start watching One Piece I was convinced there would be no better anime but I've found this (by accident) and I've watched this in one day, I still think that OP is the best anime I have ever watched but jujutsu kaisen impressed me.  It reminds me a lot of TG and Bleach vibes because of this all monsters and some kind of brutality, I don't know why but sometimes I have feeling like I'm watching better version of bnha. Fights are spectacular what I really appreciate, there is one thing I don't like so much and it is soundtrack I mean

                Mannnnn, this is Norigami done right lol. while I don't like that explaining abilities and stuff being convoluted, that's just my preference and I think people would still enjoy regardless. Tbh, I don't really like a a majority of the characters cuz they are a bit one dimensional and backstories so far just feel contrived, you can set all that aside and just let the crazy action scenes carry.
I want to make this a short review but myanimelist won't let me, so I'll just keep talking about minutia I enjoyed and disliked about Jujutsu. The story was just okay to me. Like, there is no
                  goal or objective other than getting the fingers, but it just feels like a video game retrieval task which is pretty shite. A little disappointed by the Sister school battle arc. I think the only real good character was Gotou just cuz he's good goofy and OP. Idk, everything else was just pretty good or okay, but obviously where this anime shines is the fight scenes and the associated animation.",8,longdhonghong

                I've decided a long time ago that I should read the manga instead of watching the anime because it's far more convenient and fast. Recently I've decided to go back into anime since there's so much time at hand and my goodness I'm glad that I've picked Jujutsu Kaisen. I apologise if my opinion sounds a lot like those who don't watch much anime therefore carry no weight (which is true) but I'll try my best to describe why I like about it!
The characters are all well written and likeable, actually the creator did too much of a good job because I can't ever recall
                  any characters I hate (in terms of bad writing), and yes, that also includes the curse users, interesting bunch.
The animation is absolutely gorgeous, especially the choreography of the fights, especially one consisting of Yuji, a slab of lean meat, and a patch of grass, my eyes were pretty much glued wide open for the majority of the fight. And the music, the music just hits right and suits each fight very well. (though regretfully I had to lower the volume since I had a family :/   )
They got aesthetic down nicely too, especially in the 2nd ED, it's one of the best reminder that the protagonists are teenagers.
Best of all, the humour and comedy always hits (or gone over my head), never felt out of place.
Overall I give it 9/10, it's obviously an opinion and not a fact. The reason why I've decided to not give it a ten is because I know that things will go up from here. actually now that I think about it 9-10 is not much breathing room.

                Story (10): I love the world building, 
Art (10): This one is self explanatory. Mappa does an amazing job and JJK has some of the best animation you will ever see. Take a look at the maki bullet scene or the Gojou battle in the barrier, you can clearly tell Mappa is swimming in dough and not afraid to spend it.
Sound (10): You would be hard pressed to find any better openings or endings than those in JJK. 
Character (10): I like how distinct the characters are from one another.
Enjoyment (10): Each and every episode left me feeling so much suspense that I could no
                  longer watch these episodes later at night as I would struggle to sleep afterwards.
Overall (10): The anime starts off by introducing us to Itadori Yuuji and his two teammates Nobara and Fujisaki. Yuuji gains the abilities of a certain cursed spirit and from there on out you get to see alongside him his journey as he becomes a talented cursed spirit slayer or ""jujutsu sorcerer"".",10,iTzKloudy

                Eh, JJK(Jujutsu Kaisen) is quite good. I'm going to go ahead and get everything out of the way that is horrible about the anime(No Spoilers). First of all, if you don't like anime with complex and confusing power scaling, then JJK isn't for you. The anime starts with a kind of normal power scale and then we head into about 30 different power scales and different ways each character is OP. Not to mention each Ability branches off into like 72 other random points of power. It's like the writers were like ""Lets make this as Shonen as can be!"" And then changed everything about
                  that ability that a character had because they didn't want it to be like another anime. Also the way things are organized makes me curious on whether the writers were trying to make everything nice and sequential but failed horribly. I mean its like were watching these two characters fight and one says ""Your cool and I like your shoes"" or ""Your not as strong as me"" And the other character switches the entire episode about a backstory just out of the fucking blue. I mean when you watch an anime and you see a character ask ""Why do you battle me knowing I have no chance against you, Why do you kill my people, Why do you do this to me"" and then the person that character is talking to says ""Because i have to, Because its what I was taught to do"". And we get a backstory, It makes sense and everyone walks away happy, But JJK just throws the backstory in the midst of a fight scene or just a normal group talk scene out of fucking nowhere and it blows my mind every time. Now the final thing I think is borderline NUTS is the power scaling. I mentioned other things about it before but one thing about the characters is that their power levels are crazy its like one character has this crazy ability but like every other power in the anime somehow compares to it and its like what the hell is going on?! Like random plot boosts out of nowhere just to make the story seem interesting. Makes it weird and kind of makes me wonder when we will see where this balances out moving forward with the anime. Some things for me to take into consideration of is that not only are they making an anime during a global pandemic but they are trying their hardest to keep us entertained while we wait for anime on the same level of it to come out and even though it does take a lot of elements from other anime its truly an original concept that works amazingly with the overall style of the anime, The visuals of this anime make me fall in love with MAPPA. They are like an iron knight in a dark cave shining through letting me know who's fuckin daddy of the animation studios. That's my take on this.",7,Maluwo

                Jujutsu kaisen
Easily my favorite anime at the moment. In this review, I will be covering my thoughts on every aspect of show and the main characters. 
The music: 
I absolutely revered each and every one of the soundtracks with my whole heart. Every single track was distinctive on its own, matching the rhythm of the current situation. The eerie soundtracks were successful in arousing sensations of fear in me and hyping me up for the upcoming fights. The most conspicuous soundtrack, ‘The self-embodiment of perfection’, had elements of both mystery and terror, highlighting the lingering threat-almost tangible-the Special-grade curse Manito posed. This one was my
                  personal favorite out of all as it had my heart racing from the sheer intensity of each beat at points. Similarly, the other soundtracks were, if not equally, somewhat just as awesome as this one as they made every punch, every revelation of a new curse technique and every confrontation with a curse spirit memorable. Although, the opening was a bit underwhelming and forgetful, in my perspective. I often felt like skipping it, even when I rarely ever skip an anime opening. Fairly enough, the ending, on the other hand, was just as catchy. To my disappointment, the outro changes midway through the anime and I was robbed of the pleasure of seeing all my cherished characters hop along the groovy beat of lost in paradise. I assume the second ending was supposed to seek out an emotional response from the viewers because of the transitioning of wholesome moments, but, unfortunately, it had no such effect on me. 
The plot: 
Jujutsu Kaisen uses familiar trappings of the horror genre and it encompasses subtle dark themes that keeps your toes curled the entire time. Overall, I found the plot immensely captivating. Honestly speaking, I’m not a huge fan of shounen and most action scenes usually bore me out. Hence the fact that I strangely reveled in the moment of every fight scene surprises me as well. Only an anime like Jujutsu can pull this off. Also, this is probably the only piece of fiction I am prepared to re-watch and I think that summarizes my feelings for it. I did desire for the story to be more capricious and full of unexpected turns as it already was, but I was still content with the direction it went in. I think the pace is adequately fluent and keeps the viewers intrigued. Not surprisingly, the vicious encounters with special grade curses, the mysterious missions our main trio was sent on, the occasional flashbacks of the character’s lucid past and the fluffy moments between our characters made it ever the more entertaining to watch. 
 Moving on, I think, Nobara, Megumi and Itadori make a marvelous trio. The bond they share with each other is nothing exceptional, but profoundly heart-warming and their interactions were nothing of short of whimsy. It did not take too long for me to get emotionally attached to each of them. One extraordinary aspect of this anime is that every character is precisely perfect and has a well-crafted background story that motivates and explains their future actions and beliefs. Speaking of beliefs, I personally liked how the underlying reasons behind the jujutsu student’s vehemence for excelling as a sorcerer and battle the curses varied from one character to another, vigorously influenced by their personal stories. Personally, I liked how Itadori’s beliefs stayed the same but his motives progressed as he realized letting some curses live was not an option and killing could not be avoided. Unwillingly, I got attached to some characters, like Junpei, right after they were introduced, because of how astoundingly their arc was portrayed. The way the looming horror unraveled as the story progressed invited my full attention and I couldn’t help but admire some of the atrocious characters like Mahito as well. Don’t get me wrong, I loathed him but his character was remarkably structured and the daunting aura enveloping him made me quiver. 
Another thing that makes this stand out from other archetypical shounen animes is that it involves powerful female characters. From the animes I have seen so far, most of them portray women as weak beings who require protection and need to live up to society’s stereotypes of how a girl should be. But this one is quirky as it has a handful of simp-worthy female characters that I would sell my soul for. Additionally, it does not sexualize female characters like some other animes either. This one quote from Nobara, I think, perfectly depicts how well-written these female characters are: 
‘’I don’t give a damn about ‘men’ this ‘women’ that. You can keep that shit to yourself. I love myself when I’m all pretty and dressed up. And I love myself when I’m being strong.’’
Furthermore, the prettily visuals that lies within this anime was compelling and kept me seduced.",10,sniper-mask22
40748,"
                It's a fantastic adaption so far (season 1) with superb animation, voice acting and music across the board (that is consistent from ep1 to ep24), a near perfect fusion of so many great aspects from previous Shonen shows, has a cast of well written, fun and memorable characters (almost none of them are unlikable even the ones who seem annoying at first).
[Story] 9/10
The story opens really strong putting a twist on a known Shonen trope and it never lets up, it keeps consistently introducing new concepts and characters with very good pacing and a very good balance of fights and character development/worldbuilding all the way
                  to the final episode, more importantly it is really great at subverting bad tropes of Shonen genre in clever ways (like characters revealing their powers to enemies), another great thing about this series is that it creates a strong connection between character growth and power growth, the characters grow more powerful as they gain deeper insights about their motivations and worldview, the horror/psychological aspects are the cherry on top, there is a decent amount of disturbing or straight up Cronenberg-esque body horror moments (specially scenes involving a certain villain), overall the story is solid and has very few weak points although it leaves some important questions unanswered which is expected since the series is still ongoing, hence the 9/10.
[Art] 10/10
There isn't much to say here other that it's quite amazing, the character designs are taken from the manga and updated in a very faithful and aesthetically pleasing way, the animation is crisp and the fight scenes are animated beautifully from the first fight all the way to the last, finally the two OP and ED sequences we got are very well made and never get boring to watch, hence 10/10

The music, sound effects and voice-acting are all very good, there are few memorable soundtracks but overall it's a very solid OST, nothing groundbreaking or out of this world that would warrant a 10/10, hence 9/10
[Character] 10/10
All the characters in the show are fantastic, whether it's the villains or our main characters or the sizable supporting cast, like I said before, they are all likable in their own way and they all get their moments to shine, and the tie between character growth and power growth makes those moments so memorable and impactful, though characters also do receive character developments through short concise flashbacks (usually animated in a different style for emphasis) and by the end of the series I frankly had at least +6 characters as my absolute favorites, I won't go into which characters or why to not spoil anything, but know that the characters in this show are some of the best in the Shonen genre (specially the female characters).
[Enjoyment] 10/10
All of the above makes this show an absolute delight to watch, highly recommended if you like well written Shonen shows that are willing to subvert common anime tropes intelligently, have great memorable characters and wonderfully animated fights, and don't mind a bit of horror mixed in, personally I can't wait for more.",10,Hunter-Wolf

                I LOVE JUJUTSU KAISEN. But do I think it’s as good as many make it out to be, or one of the “best new-generation anime”? Not that much. On the whole, I have to say that even though it seemed like a very promising new anime that I was extremely excited for, it didn’t quite live up to all my expectations — in this sense, I can understand why some people think it’s overrated. STILL, I like Jujutsu Kaisen (A LOT) cos it somehow knows how to make its way into one's heart, and things can only get better in future seasons (fingers crossed!). All
                  this sounds confusing but hopefully by breaking down my overall experience with Jujutsu Kaisen in this review, I can try to explain how I feel about the show.
First off, Gojo Satoru. Nah I’m kidding—actually no, not really.
Ok but in all seriousness, the characters were the best part of JJK. From their personalities and backstories to their cursed techniques and their character design, honestly the JJK characters are one of the most interesting and endearing bunch of people out there. Even the side characters never fail to pique my interest. I honestly can’t say more good stuff about the characters and I apologise for the lack of examples but really, every one of them is so memorable AND lovable. AND BADASS. Yes, all at the same time… there is probably no tastier 3-in-1 than this.
Next up is the story’s concept. The use of sorcery and cursed spirits in a shounen is nothing new but the range of cursed techniques are extremely creative. Not to mention that they add lots to be excited for in a fight scene, because there’s always some cool new thing to learn about the techniques… AND you get to watch all that happen in TOP-NOTCH animation. The whole world of curses, cursed energy & sorcery grades is also very well-fleshed out too. The details are usually explained through the characters’ thoughts or narration but the focus on technicalities can also bog down the fast-paced scenes. I sometimes found myself pausing the show to read the subtitles or to fully understand some details as a result but if you don’t read as slowly as me it’d be less of an issue :D
I’m writing this after watching the last three episodes which were SO GOOD action-wise and somehow got me sniggering to myself too. Overall, though, the writing and plot are probably where this series is lacking. Can’t quite describe how but the build-ups to the big confrontations weren’t quite the kind to keep me at the edge of my seat and so it felt hard to weigh in on the hype and adrenaline even when the plot started to pick up pace, and even the great animation couldn’t quite make up for that. However, I anticipate that future arcs (when animated) have the potential to go through the roof and just thinking about it excites me lots >>>><<<<. 
Humour is incorporated quite a lot into the show itself, as well as in Juju Stroll (the extras that play after the episode, which btw are usually pretty funny or cute or both). It’s the kind that makes you stupidly rewind the scene to watch it a couple more times but you just can’t help it yknow. In some parts the humour was a bit of a miss though... it kinda felt out of place/forced onto a totally serious scene which reminded me of Demon Slayer but it happens sometimes I guess. It’s mainly in these couple of points on writing and plot that I felt the show didn’t live up to expectations.
But ah, the music. HOW COULD I FORGET HOW GOOD OP 1 WAS. I am not ashamed to say that I really started watching JJK because I couldn’t’ get over how good the opening  was and it’s truly one that you probably wouldn’t ever wanna skip (OP 1 is Kaikai Kitan by Eve, and OP 2 is not bad too but the intro credits are next-level works of art). In general, the soundtracks are diverse & cool, they go well with the scenes, and the energy is reflected amazingly in the animation.
All in all, this show is a good watch — if not for the strong characters, then for the intricate world it has built. Of course as in all things, it’ll boil down to what your taste in shows is like. But even if Jujutsu Kaisen isn’t mindblowingly great, I’d say it is pretty likeable. And I can only see myself liking it more if it continues to be animated!!",8,Bon-E

Usually, I do a more serious review, analyzing the parts I liked and didn't like, but with JJK, there is too much I like and nothing I don't. So:
JUJUTSU KAISEN IS AMAZING. GO WATCH IT. WONDERING IF YOU SHOULD? WATCH IT. NOT SURE IF YOU'LL LIKE IT? WATCH IT. I HAVE NEVER FELT SO PASSIONATELY FOR A SHOW BEFORE. KISS KISS KISS KISS. DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT. WATCH IT!!!!!!
Anyway... if you couldn't already tell, JJK is a masterpiece of shounen. It is constantly breaking barriers and stereotypes in the genre, plus, has some of the best art I've seen in
                  anime. I would go as far as to say, as of now, JJK is THE best shounen (tied with Attack on Titan) on the market right now. Can't wait for the new movie and the second season!!!!!!! <33333333",10,oikawa_the_door

                This anime is overrated. The fact that the characters from the anime (not manga) are solely directed to being shounen heartthrobs or fanservice makes the show worse. I wish the show just stuck to the seinen theme throughout its entirety.
Aside from that, the ops and eds are top notch, and the art is impeccable. Would recommend this show to anyone.
The voice acting and dialogue was also very enjoyable, and the fight scenes are not boring to look at.
I like the protagonist also, first time I've seen a protagonist with small pupils.
Lastly, Gojo-sensei and Mai-senpai are heart <3
Thank you MAPPA for delivering this masterpiece. Objectively 8,
                  but 10 in my heart, soul, and balls.",8,kou-senpai
