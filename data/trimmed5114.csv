                First of all, I have seen the original FMA and although it was very popular and original, the pacing and conclusion did not sit too well with me. Brotherhood is meant to be a remake of the original, this time sticking to the manga all the way through, but there were people who thought it would spoil the franchise. That myth should be dispelled, as there's only one word to describe this series - EPIC.
I admit that as I've seen the original and read the manga, the pacing of Brotherhood seems to start off being VERY fast (I finally got used to the pacing after
                  watching the first fifteen eps or so). Events that took up half a volume of the manga and had spread though a few episodes of the original anime were now shown in just a single episode. However, after trying to look at it from the perspective of someone who's new to FMA (not comparing it to the manga nor the original), I believe that the pacing works and it manages to tell an intriguing story effectively with little confusion. The plot is full of clever ideas and unpredictable twists that link various parts of the story together. By the final episode, all loose ends are neatly tied up and what's left is a hugely satisfying epilogue.
The animation in FMA Brotherhood is crisp and very well done (although it does sometimes dip a bit in quality). Compared to the original FMA it's a bit simpler but that's just because the original set a very high standard to follow. The facial emotions of the characters are also perfectly presented. The action scenes are brilliant and VERY well animated, with a variety of alchemy techniques and other talents being displayed nearly every episode. The various battles are consistently exciting to watch, but somehow get even better towards the end of the series.
The voice acting is of an excellent and consistent quality, and I think that pretty much all the characters have voice actors which suit their personalities. The majority of the openings/endings are a pleasure to watch due to fantastic animated sequences and theme songs. The background music which play during the episodes usually fit very well with the situation, although some tracks seem to be overused a little at first. This becomes less of a problem as the series progresses, with plenty of new music being introduced to support the story as it reaches the finale.
Moving on to the characters (best thing about this series), the original FMA focussed mainly on Ed and Al and on their struggles to regain their bodies, whereas Brotherhood also explores other characters to great detail at the same time. The majority of the spotlight is still on the two brothers, but it highlights their interactions with new characters which were not present in the original anime. New characters include a group of people from Xing (a neighbouring country), another person from the Armstrong family (who I think has become one of the coolest members of the supporting cast), and a new main antagonist. For me, the Xingese characters in particular (Ling Yao and Mei Chang among others) provide a new dimension to the FMA world, by showing us a different culture to the militaristic one we're familiar with. I think the new antagonist is an improvement on the original FMA, as this person has a much stronger and clever link to the Elric brothers' father. Returning characters from the original FMA, such as Mustang and Scar, are much more awesome and developed due to the fact that Brotherhood is 100% faithful to the manga. Plus, Winry Rockbell now has a much more active role in the story. I can say for sure that this anime has one of the best main/supporting casts I've ever seen, and you'd probably find it difficult to label any of the recurring characters (whether they are good or evil) as being either boring or unnecessary in terms of the storyline.
One of the many good things about this series is that there has been absolutely no filler at all (yes, I'm thinking of Naruto, Inuyasha, etc), which prevents the story from losing momentum. All the episodes are concise and every scene is important as part of the huge plot. The dialogue fully explains everything and is straight to the point. As multiple characters are explored there are lots of side stories, but these are all perfectly intertwined with the main story of the Elric brothers and more often than not directly influence their journey too. Like most anime series, there are things from the manga which have been left out, but these are usually just restricted to comedy moments. There has been one episode which shows a lot of flashbacks of events so far, but that's forgiven as it shows the most epic moments of the series, and also provided us with some history on the father of the Elric brothers. 
FMA Brotherhood will be sorely missed now that it's finished. It is excellent in every aspect and has very little, if anything, that can be called a flaw (maybe rushed character development at first due to the fast pacing, but this quickly subsides). Each episode feels like it's too short, a testimony to how much it draws you in to the story and characters. There are moments which leave you smiling, laughing, sad and simply amazed. Try this anime, it's recommended for absolutely everyone, to newcomers and to those familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist.",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets an immense amount of praise in the MAL community.  Now this is just the opinion of one guy. I'm certainly not the law of the land or anything. However, I personally feel as though calling FMA:B a masterpiece and the champion of all shows is a bit of a stretch. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it or that it isn't a very solid addition to the ranks of notable shows; I really would like to preface this review by saying that I believe that FMA:B is a very good show and I wouldn't be nearly as harsh
                  on it if it weren't for the God status the show has attained in America. I would happily remand ""greatest show ever made"" to ""greatest long-running shonen ever made if you haven't seen the 2011 Hunter X Hunter""
I'm not a huge fan of the MAL categorical rating system, as I've mentioned in some of my previous reviews. I oftentimes outright ignore it. However, looking at the categories right now, I feel as though this is one instance where I can use it to talk about everything I want to so I'm going to use it.
STORY: 8
The FMA:B plot and world-building are some of its strongest aspects. The world that it creates is an immersive, full-feeling thing with many animate pieces that move even when you aren't looking at them. It's an extremely creative world as well, adopting its own set of universal laws including alchemy through equivalent exchange, mind-body duality and its own interpretation of a higher power, and it sticks by these laws. Never once does the story contradict its own rules, instead using them in creative ways to build off of each other. The plot is also one of the most engaging parts of the show, unveiling itself at just the right pace to keep you interested whilst still keeping a few major cards to play at the very end. The pieces fall into place in a way that is satisfying because it simultaneously mind-blowing and obvious, and that's one of the marks of strong storytelling.
While the FMA:B story is certainly one of the best I've seen, I find that I have to withhold my 10 score here on the grounds that its incredible direction and creativity are marred by some detrimental weaknesses. First of all, the exposition is handled extremely poorly. The first and third episodes feel like they're from some shitty cartoon network show, the show blatantly ignores the show-don't-tell rule in the entirety of its first chunk (with characters spelling out exactly what is happening and why it's happening) and its tendency to repeat important plot points over and over again quite frankly feels insulting to me as the audience as though the show is assuming I'm not able to pay attention or figure things out for myself and need to have the fact that Ed and Al committed the sin of human transmutation and lost their bodies told to me at least twenty-five times in the first two hours of show. Secondly, there's a period of time which I would probably refer to as the third fourth of the show (episodes 40-53ish) in which the show drags incredibly, adopting a typical battle-shonen approach of having characters engage in multiple-episode long one-on-one or two-on-one battles, giving them plenty of time to pose and stand off and monologue at each other. This isn't how fighting or war works, and these contrived battles really take away a lot of the climactic atmosphere. Finally, the show's ending is not nearly as satisfying as I wish it had been. The final few episodes are for the most part brilliant, but once the show plays all its cards and it's resolution time, it wraps itself up with cliches and in-your-face themes. 
ART: 8
The art is absolutely astounding 80% of the time and absolutely horrid 20% of the time. Thus the 8 score. The action is all stunning, the openings gorgeous, the backgrounds consistent and unique, building a sense of a real lived-in world. The character designs are sometimes a little bland, but for the most part they are memorable and the homunculi look brilliant so I don't have any real complaints there.
What I have a problem with is the obnoxious number of times that the show goes ""anime"" - reducing its characters to shittily-drawn caricatures and its animation to blocky, looped motion. Usually this is used during the shows attempts at humor, which I'll talk about later, but most of the time it was just extremely cringe-inducing and distracting, ruining the sense of continuity and immersion in this world. The show obviously wants you to take it seriously (it sure loves its drama) and when Al is portrayed as a big grey mound with a squiggle for a mouth it makes this difficult. There's a difference between having your character goof around and having the show itself goof around. It almost feels like a laugh-track, telling the audience ""this is the funny part!""
For the most part, however, the art is gorgeous. When it counts, it shines, and that's really what matters. 
SOUND: 10
Undeniably the strongest aspect of the show. I have no complaints whatsoever. The soundtrack is never distracting but always effective, the voice-actors (especially for Bradley and Al) absolutely nailed it and the openings and endings... dear lord. It's been said before, but the openings and endings to FMA:B are some of the very best ever made, both in sound and visuals. They tell small stories of their own. They set the tone for the episode and for their section of the show as a whole. I especially loved 'Golden Time Lover' and 'Chemistry', but I have to give special mention to SID's 'Rain'. As far as I'm concerned, that opening could have been the end of the show. It single-handedly established a sense of finality, a long-endured struggle of these characters and their causes. Everyone is portrayed as exhausted, weak and full of both despair and determination: protagonist and antagonist alike, fighting under the rain. Not for glory, not for honor, but just for the one thing they care most for. Personally, it made me extremely hyped for the final stretch of the show. It wasn't quite what we got, but at least we got some of it.
I believe that there is an intense connection between a show's opening and the audience's willingness to appreciate it. It is very likely that the intensity of many fanbases is in part due to the ability that openings such as these have to maintain feelings in regards to the show, oftentimes perhaps even distorting or altering memories of the show itself into what the opening would have you believe the show was like rather than what it was actually like. Obvious examples that jump to mind are Sword Art Online's ""Courage"" and Guilty Crown's ""My Dearest"". Remember how those shows were absolutely nothing like that? No?? IT'S TOO LATE FOR YOU
But I digress.
CHARACTER: 6
I would definitely call out the show's characters on being the weakest link and the most undeserving of the praise that the show receives. For starters, the writing is often clunky and awkward, but that's not the main issue. It's because most of them are not really characters: they're plot devices with one or two distinguishing traits tacked on. They're entirely predictable, not because they feel like real people but because they do the same things over and over again. Al talks about what he'll do when he gets his body back. Ed talks about how they'll find a way and how they will atone for their mistakes and etc. It's not that it's melodrama: it's the fact that it's the SAME melodrama over and over again. It wasn't until sometime past episode 30 that Ed stopped sounding perpetually like a broken record and started to feel as though he were actually developing, but even then he was really just defined by his arc and not by any amount of complexity.
And that's the pitfall that so many of these characters fall into. If your character's only real traits beyond their development for the sake of the show are ""hates being called short"" and ""hates milk"" they're really more of a tool with some googly eyes stuck on to them. Other characters are even worse: Armstrong is manly. His sister is more manly. Mustang wants to be Fuhrer and avenge Hughes (he's even got this great relationship with Hawkeye that could have been seriously compelling if they ever had any real conversations about anything besides ""we must overthrow the government"" and ""Hughes!"" over and over again). Winry likes Ed and automail. Ling wants to be emperor. Now, FMA:B is a complex, busy show. I could understand if it didn't have the time to make these characters anything more than chess pieces for its grand and elaborate plot, giving them a few distinguishing traits because that's really all it can manage without dragging itself out immensely. But it DOES have the time: it has all the time it spends having Ed yell about being called short. It has all the time it spends having Armstrong pull of his shirt and yell about being manly. It has all the time it spends having Ed and Al talk about getting their goddamn bodies back over and fucking over again as though I would somehow manage to forget it. Ling passing out from lack of food. May fawning comically over Ed. Mustang is antisocial LOL. The same gags, over and over again, barely even rehashed in any original way. Not only do they become painful to watch, they devour all of the development that this shallow cast of characters could have had to make me actually invested in them. They're far too static, with most of them having a single change or revelation over the course of the show's 64 episodes in order to indicate that they have grown as a person. But a good character has so much more than that: what kind of music do these people listen to? Why? Who are their role models? Why? What books do they like? What are their favorite places to eat? What do they appreciate in the people they're close to?? What are their personal histories...
Oh wait, sorry! I didn't mean to ask that last one! Please, I take it back! NOOOOOOO...
Yeah so I forgot to mention something. Screw all that stuff about making these characters possess complex personalities, FMA:B has a better way to define them.
TRAUMA
Everyone who's remotely relevant has a traumatic backstory. It's a harsh world, sure. I get that. Here's the issue: people are introduced and then defined through their trauma. Now this isn't Angel Beats bad, where horrible things happen to perfectly innocent people for no reason. Most of the tragedy is partially a result of the decisions of the characters involved, and their resulting struggle is a combination of having to cope with the consequences and with themselves and their mistakes. However, this cannot be used as a SUBSTITUTE for character development. A supplement, sure, but I still remember in episode four when Ed and Al meet a state alchemist who literally introduces himself with something along the lines of ""my wife left me because we were too poor"" before he even tells them his goddamn NAME. Here, come on in! Take a seat! Would you like some sorrow pie or tragic backstory cake? We have plenty! Ed and Al's dad left, then their mom died, then they f*cking ripped their bodies apart. Winry's parents were murdered in cold blood. Mustang had to kill lots of people. Armstrong had to kill lots of people. Everyone had to kill lots of people. Scar watched everyone he loved get killed, and then had to kill lots of people. These are always the first things we find out about people, and then for the rest of the show they are defined almost exclusively by them. If anyone is overly happy and wholesome, it means something horrid is going to happen to them. It's basic emotional manipulation. Look at this adorable little girl and her dog! Dead. Look at this smiling, picturesque family! Husband dead. Dead. Everyone innocuously happy has to die or lose someone close to them. The more broken and internally conflicted you are, the safer you are. There's no need to pile more grief on Scar, so he's relatively safe.
Yes, the characters suffer from repeatable and preventable problems. They exist mainly to function as morals-in-a-bottle with gags tacked on to them. They're difficult to relate to, because all we know about them is whatever themes they embody and one or two dumb jokes. Ikuhara writes characters more personable than this, and his stories don't make sense on PURPOSE. I did give the characters a 6 though, and there are reasons for that.
First off, despite their lack of humanization the characters complete their tasks of being walking themes with relative effectiveness. This isn't anywhere near Log Horizon S1 bad. These characters are here for a reason, they represent something, and they represent those things well. Sure, they could have easily been better, but they fulfill their purpose and for that alone they are not failures. I will also give special mention to Scar, who, while still actively defined by his trauma was executed far more impressively than the other characters. This is probably in part because the show actually viewed him as morally ambiguous as opposed to just making the character FEEL morally ambiguous when there was really no doubt that the show wanted you to think this was a 'good guy' (*cough* Mustang)
Second off, there are some exceptions to the rule. Most of my complaints thusfar have been leveled at the shows protagonists. They are the ones that suffer from dismal repetition and blatant violation of show-don't-tell. Where the show does excel is with its antagonists. There are seven homunculi in the show, incarnations of the seven deadly sins, and they so utterly clobber their ""good-guy"" counterparts in terms of being engaging, personable subtle characters that it isn't even funny. Their intensive backstories are never shoved in your face, their apparent contradictions are given plenty of time to be uncovered by the viewer, and the deliciously ironic conclusions to their arcs are done tactfully. Many times I found myself actively routing for them because they were just so much more interesting and well-executed. I would happily watch an ""Adventures of the Homunculus"" spinoff cataloging the several hundred years most of them lived before the start of the series.
ENJOYMENT: 7
I was constantly gripped by the plot. I actively looked forward to the openings and endings. The art was oftentimes orgasmic. The homunculi made me want to start looking for ingredients to make a philosopher's stone with. However, I was constantly frustrated by the show's apparent lack of respect for its viewers and by its absolutely abysmal humor. I've already said it, but I don't know if I've driven home just how infuriating it is to have exposition repeated to you over and f*cking over again and how cringe-inducing it is when somebody violates the show-don't-tell rule at extremely tense and crucial moments. It actively snapped me out of the experience whenever Ed and Al had a conversation about getting their bodies back after the 5th time it happened, and when God literally spelled out for Ed that he had discovered the meaning of life I facepalmed hard. That's not how you do themes, man. That just comes off as preachy. That's something the show suffered constantly from: it felt incredibly preachy. It's character's speeches about the answers they had found to their struggles felt much more pointed at the audience than at anyone in the show they were talking to, and that bothered the ever-loving crap out of me. And have I mentioned the humor? For every joke the show has that lands, it tries about five others that fall on their face. As I've already mentioned, they're repetitive and used as a substitute for meaningful character interactions and development. It seems as thought the show is trying to use them as a counterbalance for its immense amount of melodrama, but instead they end up just ripping apart the tone and stagnating the story. Despite these gripes, I did overall enjoy the experience and felt that the positives did inevitably outweigh the negatives so I will happily give it a 7 for enjoyment.
OVERALL: 7
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is not a masterpiece. It's a very respectable, unique, inspired and creative show and it's definitely a classic. I would happily recommend this to most people. However, don't go in with irrational expectations. It's enjoyable, it's engaging, it will definitely give you plenty to think about, but in my personal opinion it gets a little too much praise and a little too much hype. I probably would have enjoyed it more myself if I hadn't heard nothing but angelic worship for it before going into it. I formally apologize to any huge fans of the show that I may have offended: it's not by any means a bad show! I don't give out 7s all that lightly, believe me. This is merely an argument against FMA:B being the be-all-end-all of anime. Thanks for reading if you made it through that wall of text, and have a nice day!",7
"
                Adaptations have long been a thorn in the side of anime viewers, but not because they are inherently bad. No, the main problem has been that many studios have regarded the original work almost as an afterthought, and there are a number of shows that could have been wonderful if the writers had simply stuck to the original story.
One of the issues at hand seems to be ownership as producers, writers and directors all seem to want the work to be reflective of their style and perception, and in order to stamp their mark on a show they will makes numerous unnecessary changes or additions.
                  Admittedly there are times when the adaptation supersedes the original work, but more often than not the result is at best a decent anime, and at worst utter twaddle.
And then there's the other side of the coin, where the anime adaptation sticks to the storyline set out in the original work. Normally one would expect these to be superior works, but in a strange irony this is not always the case. The problem with these types of adaptations is that the original work may not have been very good, or even have a suitable narrative, to begin with, and turning them into anime only seems to exacerbate their inherent flaws.
Fortunately, the Full Metal Alchemist franchise manages to steer clear  almost all of these pitfalls. The problem is, there are no other anime that have so evenly split the viewing public's opinion between the two versions of the series. Unlike the 2003 adaptation, Brotherhood is a faithful representation of Arakawa Hiromu's hit manga, and while many fans of the franchise laud it as the best thing since sliced bread, there are a number who consider the original anime version to be the superior tale.
But we'll get to that in a bit.
Many people will already be familiar with the particulars of the story, and in a very real sense the common perception is well formed. Unfortunately, one of the problems with liking something too much is that one becomes blinded to its flaws, and while Brotherhood has very few noticeable ones where the narrative is concerned, this also serves to make them stand out.
The story is told in a very straight forward, no nonsense manner that is kind of refreshing given the penchant for filler episodes. The issue though, is that the content of the tale is much lighter in tone, much more typically ""shounen"" in its essence, than that of the first adaptation. One of the reasons for this is because the undercurrent of obsession amongst the main characters peters out towards the end of the story - a stark contrast to the ending in the first adaptation. Instead, these obsessive behaviours are effectively ""de-humanised"" by pushing them on to the non human characters.
There is a very clear sense that the plot is geared towards a more typical shounen standpoint and mentality, and while the whole still works very well as a story, one does have to wonder if the writers for the first adaptation didn't steal a march on Arakawa. It's possible that she had to change her idea of how the tale should develop because the first anime version took a much darker path than most other shounen franchises.
That said, the ending allows for a degree of catharsis that was missing from the first adaptation, and although there are some broad similarities between the two versions at times, in truth they are as different as chalk and cheese. As an added bonus this series is far less dependent on random comedic moments, and the difference this makes to the flow of the plot is palpable when the two versions are directly compared.
One big advantage that Brotherhood has is that the seven year gap has allowed for improvements in various aspects of production, and it shows in a number of areas. The animation is more fluid than before, although admittedly the difference isn't really obvious at first and only really appears during large scale action set pieces. The character designs will be very familiar to any fan, but are subtly sharper and more defined than in the previous series.
Interestingly enough, one of the biggest plus points for Brotherhood is actually its wealth of interesting characters.
As one would expect, a number of the characters from the first adaptation appear in Brotherhood, but there are also several who are notable for their absence as they do no appear in the manga. Instead, a horde of new characters appear throughout the course of the series, many of whom have their own goals, ideals and personalities. Indeed the biggest difference between the two versions is the sheer number of people who all seem to have some impact on the story.
For much of the series Edward and Alphonse Elric behave in a manner that many who have watched the first adaptation will find familiar, and one of the nice things about this is that familiarity is used to very subtly develop the pair into very different characters. The change in their personas happens very gradually, but by the end of Brotherhood one can see just how much growth the pair has undergone.
Strangely enough, the most interesting additions to the series are actually Yao Ling and Olivier Mira Armstrong (Alex Louis Armstrong's older sister - but without all the muscle flexing), two of the supporting roles. Yao Ling presents a strange dichotomy for the series to tackle, and while he doesn't develop as much as he possibly could have, this is offset by the moral and ethical dilemmas inherent in his situation towards the end of the series. On the other Olivier Armstrong possesses some of the strongest characterisation in the whole story, and while she is without doubt a major player at certain points of the show, what makes her interesting is the fact that the viewer is never quite sure of her goals.
There are a number of very strong characterisations in the series, but one of the things that is a little strange is the difference between the two versions where the homunculi are concerned. Unlike the first adaptation the homunculi in Brotherhood have very different origins, even though they still deal with similar obsessions. This raises an interesting perspective on the series as a whole, and is one of the reasons why Brotherhood is far more of a shounen tale than the original adaptation. The plot takes on a subtly lighter tone, even though it may not seem that way, once their origins are understood, and the main reason for this is the ""de-humanisation"" I mentioned earlier. The viewer is aware that these characters, though human-like in form, are not linked to humans in any way, and this awareness acts as a buffer so the viewer is less likely to question the actions and behaviour of the homunculi. In essence one is subjected to the ethos that monsters are evil and do bad things, which raises some interesting issues where Kimblee, Greed and the military's generals are concerned.
The quality of the acting is possibly the main reason why Brotherhood is able to pull off its feat of developing not only the familiar characters, but also the new additions. Paku Romi and Kugimiya Rie reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonse Elric, but with the exception of a few roles, the remaining cast are very different from the first outing. Now normally one might consider this a recipe for disaster, but it's a testament to the quality of not only the actor's abilities, but also the scriptwriters, that this series easily stands shoulder to shoulder with the original.
The music is very well composed and produced, and the series has a surprisingly large number of opening and ending themes, especially for 64 episode series. That said, fans of Brotherhood may find themselves in a bit of a quandary, especially if they prefer the OPs and EDs from the first series. As for the sound effects, they are handled in a decidedly competent manner that makes one wonder why other shounen anime seem to have trouble in this department. Granted there are occasions when there's a bit of a cacophony, but in general the effects are clear, bold, and well choreographed.
Now unlike most viewers, I actually consider Brotherhood to be equal to the first series, and I don't really fall on one side or another. Like a number of fans my preference is for the much darker tone of the first series, however the cathartic ending of Brotherhood, as well as the improvements in production and animation, go some way to balancing the scales. Some people prefer the somewhat darker nature to Ed's character from the first adaptation, but in all honesty the rationale behind the two versions is very different, and while they're broadly the same character, that perception is only really valid until the last few episodes of either show. The same principle applies to Alphonse, Roy Mustang, in fact to most of the characters.
That said, Brotherhood is just as entertaining and involving as its predecessor, and it's a testament to Arakawa's skill as a mangaka that she has been able to produce a tale that, at the very least, rivals the original anime adaptation.Yes, Brotherhood is more typically shounen than the other version, but the nice thing about this is that fans are given two very good versions of the same story, and that is something rare in anime.
Now if only all remakes, revisions or reboots could be this good.",9

                Overview:
FMA Brotherhood is an anime that needs no introduction. In the following paragraphs, I will be reviewing this legendary series and discussing whether or not it truly deserves this title.
SPOILERS for both Brotherhood and 2003 FMA!!!!
Plot: 
The plot takes place in the country of Armestris, which is basically like an alternate WW2 Germany. It is constantly at war for reasons that are less than just and is ruled by a rather nefarious government. What makes this world special is that alchemy is the primary science instead of the much less fun and flashy science of our own reality. Alchemy allows practitioners to transmute material into
                  other useful material, and basically do all kinds of awesome stuff! Our heroes are the Elric brothers, who wish to find the legendary Philosopher's Stone and gain back their original bodies that they lost in a forbidden alchemy ritual gone horribly wrong. In order to search for the stone, they join the military. Unfortunately this means they have to serve under a rather evil government and face strong moral dilemmas. The Elric brothers don't wish to take part in the government's genocidal campaigns, but they need the military in order to accomplish their own personal goals. Of course, things are a bit more complicated by the fact that many in the military are actually good people and are either unaware of just how bad the government is, or feel remorse for their crimes and  wish to change the government. This is refreshing for a shonen series in which ""good and evil"" is too often clear cut. We have all seen Hollywood movies where the German Army is filled with nothing but pure evil monsters with zero humanity. As a side note, eventually Hollywood got MUCH better with treating the Germans this way... thanks to us ethnic Germans making up 40% of the US population, but Hollywood STILL treats the Russians and certain other groups this way! 
Eventually, the Elric brothers uncover the frightening truth that the real leader behind the government is an ancient evil being called ""Father"" who uses his homunculus minions to due his bidding and wishes for ultimate knowledge and power! The Elric brothers also make many allies on their adventures including Scar, the Xingese, and Hohenheim, who all contribute in the fight against Father. The plot ultimately concludes with a very happy ending, which pleased fans far more than the bittersweet ending of the 2003 anime. It should also be noted that unlike the plot of the 2003 anime, FMA Brotherhood mostly stays faithful the Hiromu Arakawa's original manga.
Differences between 2003 FMA and Brotherhood:
Although there are many differences in the plot which I will get to, the most immediately obvious difference is in the tone of the series' narrative. The 2003 FMA has a VERY dark and somber tone throughout the series, which makes it really stand out as the oddball of the shonen world. FMA Brotherhood has tragic moments, but they are balanced out with zany comedy, more happy endings, and less emotional suffering in general. The tone in Brotherhood actually feels like you are watching a shonen anime like Naruto or One Piece. You know going in that there will be sad parts, but all will turn out well in the end. FMA 2003 feels closer to watching Berserk than it does to watching Naruto or One Piece! Whether a viewer prefers lighthearted shonen or brooding seinen is a matter of taste, but let us take a look at the subject matter being dealt with in this series. In both the 2003 FMA and Brotherhood, this is a series about German soldiers serving a genocidal regime and ultimately having to rebel against the government and try atone for their crimes. Does that sound like something that should be a fun, zany comedy? ""It is almost certain that we will fail. But how will future history judge the German people if not even a handful of men had the courage to put an end to that criminal?"" - Henning Von Tresckow. I can ASSURE you he didn't tell a stupid joke 20 seconds afterwards so that his listeners wouldn't feel sad about the deaths of 17 million civilians murdered by the Nazis as ""untermenschen"". Was the movie Das Boot a fun comedy? NO! Have you ever wondered why that is? The reason is that making a movie or series about German soldiers reflecting on mass genocide into a delightful romp is fucking stupid as hell! To think that people on MAL accuse Elfen Lied of having bad tone whiplash. FMA Brotherhood thematically achieves a mood whiplash other anime can only dream of.
Now we get to characters and plot differences. Firstly, lets talk about everyone's favorite FMA character, Roy Mustang. In FMA 2003, Roy is the one who murdered Winry's parents instead of Scar. Roy is also MUCH more affected by his guilt for having murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in the name of an evil government. In 2003 FMA, Roy actually tries to kill himself in a state of deep depression, but Hughes stops him and instead inspires him to live, so that one day he can overthrow and lead the government. Roy actually manages to kill Fuhrer Bradley and do what he had dreamed of for so long. However, he is too overwhelmed by the emotional stress to simply stay in the military and take a role of leadership like he does in Brotherhood. Roy retires to a simple life with Hawkeye instead and only uses his alchemy again in the movie Conquerors of Shamballa to save the people of Central. Roy is a MUCH more empathetic and truly human character in the original 2003 series. He is actually, truly effected by guilt and stress the way a real person that isn't a total sociopath would be. He doesn't just feel kind of bad for about 5 minutes, then move on. ""I killed those people under orders, I don't have to REALLY feel too bad about it."" If the point is to make Roy a true military hero that reveals the full horrors of war and shows how even good men will commit evil deeds under orders, then the 2003 anime accomplishes this a LOT better than Brotherhood did!
Now let's look at the Arab anti-hero Scar. In both series, Scar is a survivor of the Ishvalan genocide who is consumed with the desire for vengeance against the State Alchemists that slaughtered his people. In both series, Scar has an elder brother who violated Scar's Ishvalan religion and practiced alchemy, ultimately saving his life and giving him his special arm. However, in the 2003 anime we learn that Scar's brother violated a FAR more sacred law and tried to resurrect his dead lover with alchemy. This was of course a miserable failure that drove his brother mad with grief and furthered Scar's hatred of alchemy. This works better in terms of narrative, because it gives Scar even more reason to hate alchemy as violently as he does and view it as ""false"". It also better explains why Scar sympathized with Edward Elric, because he could tell he had lost his limbs in a human transmutation and was reminded of his own brother. In terms of objective ""writing 101"" and constructing a narrative, this extra back story from the 2003 anime was brilliant and felt far more complete than Brotherhood. Scar's end is also WAY better in the original 2003 anime. In Brotherhood, Scar fights his ultimate battle against Wrath, who was only the 3rd strongest homunculi, not the real mastermind behind the Ishvalan genocide, and had no real connection to Scar since they had never met. In the 2003 series, Scar fights his ultimate battle against the pure evil State Alchemist Zolf Kimblee, who murdered his brother and gave him his namesake scar. Which of these makes sense in terms of basic storytelling? Having a character's big fight be against a personal opponent where the struggle actually MEANS something, or have the fight be against a barely connected random character? It is sad that Scar has to die in the 2003 series, but his death is a heroic one and ultimately a much better written conclusion to his story. In Brotherhood, Scar somehow survives in order for a happier ending and we get a quick cameo of him working to rebuild Ishval. Scar is a flawed anti-hero consumed with a desire for revenge. In the original series, his tragic and heroic death makes the audience care a LOT more about him than Brotherhood does. Would it have been good storytelling in Lord of the Rings if Boromir for some reason survived, then we get a quick 2 sentences about how he is living happily in Gondor after the war? No. That would be really stupid and Tolkien being a good writer, realized that and gave Boromir a heroic death of penance that better closed his story.
There are WAY too many examples, so we will make our final one a comparison between Dante and Father. How can I even compare them? You are probably thinking right now. ""Dante is just a forgettable Filler Villain and Father is one of the greatest villains in anime history!"" The truth is that Father...isn't actually a very good villain. Remember that this is a story about an alternate WW2 Germany and a group of soldiers fighting against an evil government following a massive genocide. Adolf Hitler was not a nice man, but he WAS a human being. Dante is powerful, but ultimately just an ordinary human sociopath who wishes to sacrifice countless people she views as inferior to guarantee her own Godhood and immortality. I think that sounds a LOT closer to Hitler than a fucking ink blot genie from Ancient Persia looking for ultimate knowledge. If you are going to tell a story with OBVIOUS real world parallels, then STAY CONSISTENT! Government atrocities and genocides happen due to ordinary human leaders with extremely selfish desires, NOT evil genies! The Holocaust, Cambodian Genocide, Rwandan Genocide, and Armenian Genocide were not caused by Mr. Popo!!!
Animation:
FMA Brotherhood is a very well animated series and admittedly does look better in most places than the 2003 original. Is the animation enough to give it the title of greatest of all time? No. 
Soundtrack:
The soundtrack for FMA Brotherhood is once again quite solid, but isn't even as good as the 2003 FMA OST, let alone worthy of the greatest of all time title! Just compare the main theme from the Brotherhood OST to the main theme Bratja from 2003 FMA. The main theme for Brotherhood is a fairly bland orchestral piece with some ominous chanting that sounds like a throw away extra from the Hellsing Ultimate soundtrack. The main theme from the 2003 FMA is a heartbreaking, beautiful song about an elder brother asking forgiveness from his younger brother. Bratja is WAY better than anything in Brotherhood without question! Compare the first opening theme of Brotherhood to the 1st opening of the 2003 series. The 2003 series has Ready Steady Go, one of the greatest openings in the history of anime. Brotherhood has an extremely forgettable opening that wouldn't rank in the top 500 anime openings.
Overall:
FMA Brotherhood is a good anime overall, but it is ONLY a good anime. It isn't anywhere NEAR the greatest anime ever made! It is actually vastly inferior to the original 2003 FMA and even that wasn't the single greatest anime of all time, although a MUCH better candidate than Brotherhood. Of course the title of G.O.A.T. is a highly subjective and debatable matter, but there isn't a single category where Brotherhood REALLY outshines its competitors. Some people say Legend of the Galactic Heroes is the greatest of all time. I'm not going to say that LOTGH is an absolutely flawless work, because it isn't. However, it actually stays consistent in its tone with the heavy ideas and themes it presents. Brotherhood does not. Brotherhood is WAY closer to Elfen Lied than LOTGH in terms of keeping a consistent tone  to respect very dark and serious subject matters. LOTGH has an absolutely EPIC scope with hundreds of well written characters, maybe the most intricate politics in all of anime, and gets viewers to really think about real world problems and issues in terms of government, better than any other anime ever made. In other words, LOTGH actually DOES have areas where it clearly outshines its peers and therefore has a far more legitimate claim to the throne. Cowboy Bebop has almost without question the greatest original OST in anime history, is more accessible to non-anime fans than any other anime, and is an absolute blast from beginning to end. Once again, it has areas where it is clearly the best, so a more legitimate claim. Name just ONE thing that Brotherhood is the best at? Most tearjerking? nope. Best written? not even close. Most philosophical and complex? Hell no. Best art? nope. Best soundtrack? nope. It is solid around the board, but it isn't actually truly great at anything! I would therefore argue that Brotherhood is NOT the greatest of all time, is INSANELY overrated, and you are honestly much better off watching the 2003 FMA. I'm sorry if this review hurt any feelings. My job as a critic is to say what needs to be said.",7
"
                Since I couldn't find any legitimate objective analysis in any of these fanboy reviews, I decided put my own review: 
Here's why FMA:B and it's Manga counterpart don't work:
It's just a disjointed piece of art. The initial premise of the narrative: two young siblings that horrifically lose their mother and parts of themselves is incredibly dark and powerfully poignant. Their journey to find the philosophers stone is one that's objectively adventurous but the endpoint is still inherently adult and sophisticatedly gritty; especially as it delves into the implications of bringing a dead person back to life early on in the series.
So why is it disjointed?
                  Because there's a mistranslation of tonal nuance throughout the entire series. Now I don't mean stylistic aspects such as art style choices e.g. Chibi segments (because those are minuscule details in the grand scheme of storytelling devices), but rather the way they're implemented in the story. For example, one second we're dealing with the introspective reconciliation of human birth and how beautiful it is and the very next we drop it for side-gags just to transition into the next topic/character development. It just doesn't fit. It's formulaic. It's predictable storytelling at it's finest and it absolutely ruins the pacing.
It's a huge shame because the character development and dialogue in the series is exquisitely written (some of the best in any story I've ever seen); e.g. Edward's speech about his existential crisis provided a deep psychoanalytical view into his personality and character. This is amazing character development! However it actually lessens the impact of the narrative and my personal enjoyment of the series because it contrasts heavily with the tone of the series. Right down to the very commercial transitions with the quirky voice-over of the title; every little stylistic choice is presented as a complete antithesis to the themes of the series.
Fullmetal Alchemist should NOT be sugarcoated with a light-hearted aesthetic. This is something I'd hate to say in any other series because pretentiously ""dark and gritty"" series (*cough* Tokyo Ghoul *cough*) are the bane of my existence but this is the one exception. If the themes of the series are of complex adult issues, why is the tone appealing to childish humour and zany adventurous antics?
With all that being said, I totally understand why Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is considered one of the greatest Animes of all time because it is substantially provocative and extremely complex behind the aesthetics much like many other great Animes like One Piece, Hunter X Hunger, Cowboy Bebop and Dragon Ball.
Personally, it just doesn't work from a narrative perspective because it feels disjointed and unfocused in the way it clashes with stylistic ambiguity. Through this loss of tone, the series becomes a chain of loose threads that are vaguely commentating on the overall themes of the narrative which is why I rated Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and the Manga: 5/10.",5

                *Spoiler Warning
Aside from the usual everyday anime Art and Sound standard(of which most animes pass anyways), there are essentially three main factors that I see as important in Anime:
1. Complexity(detail) (which adds Depth)
a. Characters
b. Plot
c. Setting
2. Progress (which adds Depth)a. Character Development
b. Plot Development
c. Shifts of Setting
3. Novelty (which, again, adds Depth)
a. Characters
I. Personality
b. Setting
c. Plot
--------
1. Complexity(detail)
It's understandable that because FMA: Brotherhood paid attention to its simple-minded viewers(readers), the resulting complexity of the entirety of the anime would turn out bland. The characters were too simple, particular the main characters. The plot was horrendously predictable after 3-4 episodes and then there was the lack of focus in the setting. We see an icy place, dessert place, and then there's the ordinary regions where the main characters dwell.
a. Character
Edward Elric, supposed talented alchemist(or close), with a terrible past. He is strong-willed but at the same time childish. He gets very attached to acquainted ""war"" victims and is always affected by the past. He uses automail(right arm and left leg) and alchemy to fight his way through almost everything. *At first, He hates his father*. He wants to bring back his and his brother's bodies. That's it. No deep personal philosophy. No internal struggle. No moral ambiguity. No split ""demonic"" personality. No subconscious complications. No crazy stuff. No bullshit. He just does what he feels is right. True, Ed experiences things such as guilt and sorrow because of the things he feels as mistakes. He consistently feels regretful for trying to transmute her own mother, and his own dad accused him for actually just being a coward. Nevertheless, said reaction and thoughts are way too simple. In the end, the show just forces the viewer and Edward to just swallow everything and move on. 
Alphonse Elric. I actually preferred this guy over his brother. I mean think about the psychology of a character stuck on an empty armor? Think about its implications. I also liked the idea that Alphonse is naive yet inhumanely able. He doesn't have to eat or sleep and is almost immortal. (though arguable since it was mentioned that there is a possibility that the armor would reject his soul eventually.) Link ""naive"" to his actual physicality. His main vulnerability is still an internal idea---the seal transcribed within his metal body. The only problem with the character is the lack of focus on his own thoughts and so on. The lack of exploration in his psychology. There was one episode that showed Al's doubt of his own existence, but this wasn't clearly detailed enough.
B. Plot***
Not much to say here. Mother dies. They become state alchemist. Look for philosopher's stone. (How are they even allowed the time?) *They meet homunculus. They save everyone from homunculus at the same time they get their bodies back. That's it. They should've at least included Lin's ""chinese struggle"" and absorbed the surrounding nations within the plot.*
C. Setting 
Automails? Interesting idea. Problem: Detail, no elaboration.
How many nations were there? I only remember desert, snow, and the rest of the dullness. Where is the economy?
Alchemy. The main idea of the show. Quite elaborate in terms of ""the gate"", ""immortality"", and other plot-devices. Problem: How much variety of alchemy did Ed and Al actually use? Move rocks and move more rocks. Mustang did fire tricks. Where are the complicated algorithms? The ""super moves""? The classification of alchemy? There were mentions of ""eastern alchemy"", ""western alchemy""; ""comprehension, deconstruction, reconstruction""; ""equal exchange"" but these things weren't sufficiently fused and utilized as a basis for a unique battle system. sigh.
2. Progress***
***Ok. What happened again? They walk everywhere and found out that what they were looking for was right beneath their city and that it's sourced out of human souls? How did they change physically and mentally? ***
A. Character Development
How much did Ed grow? How much did his personality go from A to B? How much did his height go from A to B? Ask yourself.
How much did Al grow? After experiencing all those moments, you'd think they'd have a more bad-ass versions of themselves...
I mean at least change the character's appearances. Transmute Al's armor into some flexible form or cut Ed's hair. 
B. Plot Development
When I said I already knew the outcome after 3-4 episodes, I wasn't kidding. Maybe that's exactly why I felt there wasn't much change. These ""homunculus"" just won't die. They keep coming back and it's like a show of power-puff girls where the girls continuously fight their arch-nemesis's. And don't even get me started on the shallowness of the homunculus'. (though I particularly liked Envy and his end.) Almost nothing, aside from what was already known, was happening. They found out about city's secret and they go back to their traveling and meeting new friends and then they go back traveling and finally they decided to finish the job.
C. Shift of Setting
I guess I shouldn't have expected One Piece. There were some interesting places such as the destroyed kingdom or the northern camp but almost everything happened in the same region.
3. Novelty
Alchemy and Automail(Shounen) is an interesting combination. If I hadn't watched the first anime, It wouldn't better. Not really. They give you interesting general ideas and they stop there. More details would have produced more novelty. Character-wise, the two had too normal personalities. Interestingly enough, the flashbacks had a more novel point of view than the original. 
A. Characters
What would have really gotten well was if their circumstances actually shaped a plenty of their personalities. The loss body parts didn't serve much meaning in terms of their character build up. What I saw was stubborn kid and naive brother. How swell...
B. Setting
Good General Idea - Not detailed = meaningless.
C. Plot
Novel in general but the lack of detail lessens the entire novelty.

Clearly not for CPN(character, progress, novelty)-oriented individuals.",3

                I can't even watch the original FMA anime now that I'm currently watching Brotherhood! This is a NO FILLER anime it gets straight to the point with it's beautiful animation and amazing portrayal of the manga, everything is so different! Emotions are strong and there's more of a connection between characters then in the original anime, you immediately get dragged into this show within the first 5 minuets, this is honestly one of the most spectacular anime's i've ever laid my eyes on, it's definitely one of the best new shows of the last couple years. Its a definite watch, don't miss out!

                Now, this is a prime example of how to adapt an manga into an anime the RIGHT way.  The original Fullmetal Alchemist, though well made and very popular, went into a downward spiral as soon as it diverted from the manga storyline and never seemed to recover.  This however, shows that instead of trying to add their own story elements when adapting manga/visual novels etc., sometimes anime producers should just sit back and retell the great story that has already been written in the original.
This anime starts off at a breakneck pace.  It shoots entire volumes of the manga in a couple
                  of episodes.  It was to be expected though, as Bones is trying to fit 100+ chapters of manga into a 1-year long series.  However, once you get used to it the pacing seems very appropriate for the series and only seems to increase the suspense.  While small elements have been omitted from the manga, these are mainly non-essential and have no impact on the story.  Yet while many of these omitted elements are comedic in nature, Brotherhood still manages to switch between seriousness and comedy so fast you'll get whiplash.  I quite enjoyed this particularly as a sort of trademark of the series.  The actual plot-line twists and turns in unexpected ways and keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the climax grips you like no other.  Many disregard the plot as being generically shonen, but it is these twists and its exploration into the psyche and motivation of the characters that propel it past this ""generic shonen"" label.
The art is of a different style to the original FMA.  It is a little simpler, and comedic scenes sometimes even stray into an outright chibi style, but this is by no means a bad thing.  If anything it is closer to the the style that Hiromu Arakawa draws with in the manga.  What its lacking in detail, it makes up for with first-class fight sequences (as to be expected of Bones).  The animation overall is quite polished and character movements are very fluid and natural.
The characters on both sides really caught my attention as one of this series' strengths.  It boasts a diverse range of characters, all of which have considerable substance and a distinct purpose in the storyline.  The Homunculi especially turn out to be completely different from the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime, and more awesome in my opinion.  Edward and Alphonse are still the main focus of the story as they quest to find the Philosophers' Stone and restore their bodies, but now Winry also takes a more central role along with Ed and Al's father, Hohenheim.  There is also a host of new characters which didn't feature in the first anime adaptation, including a few from the mysterious country Xing and a new main villain.  Being completely faithful to the manga, all the characters' separate journeys and origins are told in much greater detail.  Each character's values and beliefs are tested almost to breaking point as the story reaches its later stages, providing a somewhat surprising and refreshing depth to the cast.
The one thing I initially disliked about this series was the soundtrack, which lacked substance and was very repetitive.  The first opening was brilliant, one of the best I have seen, but the background music was lacklustre.  However, as the series went on more music was added and the soundtrack began to add a great atmosphere to fight scenes and dialogue alike.  The voice actors also really show their ability throughout the series and seem very well suited to their roles.  With such an all-star cast of voice-actors you wouldn't expect any less.
Overall Bones has done an awesome job surpassing its previous effort and faithfully retelling the Fullmetal Alchemist manga.  Enjoyment wise, you'd be hard pressed to find a shonen anime that will entertain you as much as FMA Brotherhood.  Truly a great anime, there's no other way to describe it.  A must-see for people new to anime and hardened otakus alike.  Overall score: 9.4/10 (rounded to 9).",9

                ""We're not gods, we're only human. We can't even save a little girl, so what good are we?""-Edward Elric
Now let's talk about the best rated show on this website. Ever since its release, fans and critics alike have a mixed reaction to the show. Some of them say that the original show is better while others say this is better. I can't see why we can't like both. They each have things that really work about them. I think they are both masterpieces on a entertainment and artistic level. Some moments in the show will make you laugh, then the next question life, and then
                  cry your eyes out. Some moments in the show are just plain beautiful from the characters, animation, and the really touching moments. There are moments were some of the characters you get attached to die. (Not going to tell what characters because of spoilers, obviously.) A character will get super depressed, and one even almost goes insane. All of these characters express real human emotions unlike some other anime which they express one key emotion. The emotional scenes aren't forced, they have a really big impact on you as a person. You'll start to relate to every character and even question life. Some examples being ""What is the truth?"" or ""Could humans play the role of god?"" That's why I love this show so much. You'll start to look at the world in a different perspective after you watch this and the original show. Now shall we get to the review?
Story 10/10 Standout(s) The fantastic end to the series
If you want to know my original thoughts of the story, read my review of the original show. Anyway the end to this anime is one of the best endings I've ever seen in an anime. It was very beautiful and touching. This review is suppose to be spoiler free (In most cases.) So I can't tell you my thoughts of the ending. If you want more in detail of the ending, just ask me. Anyway, I can't talk about much about the story without repeating myself, so let's go to the art and animation.
Art and Animation 10/10 Standout(s) The animation
You can tell that they had a huge budget just by looking at a character. It was very solid and very easy on the eyes. This really shines in the well animated action scenes. They were just plain epic! What I didn't explain in full detail in my review of the original was the character designs. I didn't give enough praise for them, I just said they were creative and expressive, that was it. You can tell which character is who at first glance. That's a really hard thing to do for a 64 episode anime, but this show pulls it off very well. The character's have there own unique features that stand out among the rest. Now let's go to the sound.
Sound 10/10 Standout(s) The dub
The soundtrack really fit in with the anime. I mostly loved the music they played in the action scenes or when there was something bad going on. I found it very unique and weirdly fit with the tension of a scene. For the dub, most people consider it one of the best dubs out there and I don't blame them. The only difference between the dub for the original and the dub for this was Al's actor. Al's original actor, Aaron Dismuke, had too deep of a voice to play Al anymore. So they got Maxey Whitehead to play him. So was Maxey good as Al? She did a fantastic job in my eyes. When I saw the first episode, I thought that was the original actor. That's how good her performance was. If you want me to go in depth about the dub, read my review of the original. Now the one you've all been waiting for, the characters.
Characters 10/10 Standout(s) Every single one of them
This is my favorite character cast in any anime. They were all very entertaining in their own little way. If you want to hear me talk about Ed and Al, read my review of the original show. Let's just talk about Roy Mustang and Maes Hughes.
Roy Mustang:
On the outside, Roy seems like the calm, collected, and cool guy. On the inside he values the lives of his comrades like Riza Hawkeye and Maes Hughes. If one of them were to die, he would just be sad for the rest of his life. He also has a temper that sometimes gets the best of him. This is a guy you don't want to mess with. He'll burn you to death with his flame alchemy. What makes Roy such a good character is that he'll protect those he values with all his heart. He does have a few weaknesses too, you can't have a good character without his or her faults. Like I said, his temper and the fact that if you were to kill one of his friends, he would vow to kill you no matter what and won't forgive you. He doesn't forgive his enemies that easily. Overall, Roy is defiantly one of the best characters in this anime.
Maes Hughes:
Hughes may seem like the comic relief when you first meet him, but he has more of a personality then that. He is kind, outgoing, and an overall funny person! It's kind of weird how him and Roy get along so well. Hughes is more fun and loud while Roy is more calm and collected. He loves so many people and almost doesn't hate anyone. He loves his daughter and his wife. There's even a few jokes about them in some of the episodes. It feels like his family is the military, his real family, and the Elric brothers. He made a huge impact on the audience for reasons I won't spoil. Overall, a fun guy and a great character!
Enjoyment 10/10
People who will love this show: Everyone, especially fans of the manga.
People who won't like this show: I don't know who wouldn't like this.
Overall 10/10
Positives: Everything
Negatives: None
This is defiantly one of the best animated shows of all time. It's amazing how many things you'll learn in this anime. It taught me all sorts of things about life. I am in love with this series. Great anime and deserves a 10 from everyone. So watch it if you haven't.",10

                This review is only meant for those who haven't seen the original anime version of Fullmetal Alchemist. 
What can I say about this show? I never even tried to follow the original anime.. I knew it was a big success and has a lot of followers everywhere. But it just didn't catch onto me like it did with so many others. With this renewed version, which follows the manga storyline a lot more precise than the first version, the team behind FMA: Brotherhood did a fantastic job. 
The characters are instantly attractive.. what I mean with that is they are very well portrayed as people,
                  unlike so many other anime shows. The story is also instantly compelling.. it drops you right into the world of FMA and does a thorough job of explaining to you how things work. And as far as I've seen, the story never gets repetitive or old. As soon as you finish one episode.. you'll force yourself to watch the next. 
The voice actors are another major plus. The sheer talent of many of them is just unbelievable. I especially liked the fact that the voice actor who did (among others) Kira/Yagami Light's voice in Death Note, Mamoru Miyano. Does the voice for Ling Yao, which makes his character even more intriguing. 
If FMA Brotherhood keeps up this kind of pace, quality and plot development, then I'm definitely going to add it to my 'All-time-favourite-anime' list. 
A must see!",10
"
                If one wishes to obtain something, something of equal value must be given, that is the law of equivalent exchange, the basis of all alchemy, the law that governs the world of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.
Brotherhood follows the adventures of brothers Edward and Alphonse elric , who have commited taboo and tried to transmutate their mother back from the dead. As a result alphonse is left without his body and stuck to a metal armor and ed with a metal arm and a leg  thus the nickname fullmetal. Thus the two brothers embark on a quest to find the famous philosopher's Stone that is said
                  to allow alchemists to ignore the law of equivalent exchange and help them get their bodies back. I will not go into more details because it will spoil the wonderfull story of the anime. Anyway let's get started. 
As opposed to it's 2003 counterpart  Brotherhood does not have filler episodes or sidestories, the manga being almost finished at the time the anime started. There were a few ovas and specials that came out towards the animes end or after it had finished but I am not counting those.But I have to say they managed to strike a perfect balance. Since it had all the source material it needed the anime does not feel stale,I think it goes on  at a great pace  and it manages to strike a perfect balance between fights, serious moments, light hearted ones . But if you are a big fan of the 2003 anime you might find this a bit too fast as some of the characters lack the development they had in the first series and you might not feel as attached to them as you were back then. Though personally I loved the pacing, as I never got bored and I got entangled in a wonderfull story that just kept dragging me in.
The art has greatly improved over its predecessor and even now it's way above your usual animes. The facial expressions are great and the battles, oh man they are going to give you a boner, even if you're a girl. Trust me. Though some people might be set off a bit by the fact that the animation style seems to change from battle to battle, but I think that increases it's quality as very rarely you will have the same two characters battling each-other thus each battle seems unique and fresh. I especially enjoy the ones that involve Wrath as man he is a beast.
The sound is great. I have watched the anime in jappanese thus that is the sound version I shall review.Romi Park and Rie Kugimiya reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonnes and deliver a top quallity performance yet again, but the rest of the cast is not going to let you down either as you can feel they actually enjoy voice acting these characters and that they give their all in their performance. Also I swear to god all the openings and endings are epic. I have all those songs on my playlist at the moment since god they are awesome and fit the show perfectly. 
I also like the fact they Brotherhood doesn't do something a lot of anime do and by that I mean they do not spoil what will happen in the anime with the intro or outro because they are all custom made and not just scenes picked up from the anime to show off.
Now the greatest strength of the anime are its characters. The original series mostly explored just the two protagonists Edward and Al, but brotherhood manages to show off almost any character they introduce, their motives and their dreams. For example Roy Mustang and his dream to become the next Fuhrer to protect all his comrades or scar's dream first of revenge and later of change. As I said earlier some might characters might feel a bit rushed because of the fast pace of the anime (I'm looking at you hughes and nina) but I assure you it does not draw back from the story one bit as they still somehow fullfill their role.
The anime lacks a bit in the replay value, as you wil already know all the big reveals which will probably detract a little from the overall enjoyment  for some, but I watched it multiple times (around once every one and a half years) and I found it refreshing most of the time.
Also if you want to watch the 2003 series you should do it before you watch Brotherhood for one simple reason. The 2003 anime is also a very solid addition to one's library but Brotherhood is the superior version in all areas and you might not enjoy the 2003 version as much if you watch it after brotherhood. Though if you watch the new series after the 2003 one you will definetly still enjoy it as much, if not even more,  as opposed to watching it first.
Overall this will always be one of the most enjoyable animes I have ever watched, excelling in all areas with a very compelling story line, complex characters, astonishing art and epic soundtracks. I wholeheartedly recommend you go watch it right now, it is a classic and a must see for any anime enthusiast out there.",10

                One of my favorite anime of all time!
I was one of those people who thought that FMA: Brotherhood is the second season of Fullmetal Alchemist (2003). FMA Brotherhood has been popping up in Best Anime Lists on Youtube so it piqued my interest.
It follows, or rather it is more parallel with the story in the manga. The art and animation is magnificent, it stayed true to the characters' design but there was a more polished look. The fluidity of the movements during fight scenes are also a feast for the eyes.
I could not find a single flaw in this series (except I that I wanted
                  more episodes). The characters were all wonderfully written. It's hard to create secondary characters that are as strong as the main ones when it comes to viewers' attachments. 
I found myself falling in love with these amazing characters while I was watching FMAB. It didn't matter if the characters were only shown for one episode, I'm looking at you Nina and Alexander. What mattered was the impact those characters gave. (Like a sledge hammer to the heart)
And the story, it's hard to find words to describe FMAB's story. The only thing I can think of is that it's magnificent. It's funny, action packed, mysterious heart wrenching and beautiful. 
This is one of those anime that will leave you feeling empty after you finish it. And I mean that in a good way. I've invested so much emotions in this story, in these characters that when it's finally over it left me feeling lost. That is how amazing this is and I'm not just saying that. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is quite a masterpiece in my opinion.",10
"
                I'll start this by saying that despite being an adamant fan of Fullmetal Alchemist for a couple of years now, I've never managed to finish the first anime series. I've remained caught up with the manga as much as possible, however, and I'm very excited at where this series is going to go.
Fullmetal Alchemist, as I'm sure you know, is the story of the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse. Their story begins a number of years before the actual start of the series, with the tragic death of the boys' mother. Edward and Alphonse, child prodigy alchemists at the time, form a pact to resurrect
                  her. Extensive alchemical training finally culminates in the most important experiment of their lives; the forbidden practice of Necromancy. But something goes wrong.
Edward is forced to stare in horror as his brother is decomposed before his eyes. He is then whisked away to a mysterious location, where a strange entity reveals to him what the experiment lacked; the Philosopher's Stone. Edward is then returned to his home, where he discovers his brother still missing and his own leg gone. In an act of desperation, he sacrifices his own arm in order to preserve his brother's soul into a suit of armor. Events thereafter eventually culminate in a new mission for the Elrics; to procure the Philosopher's Stone and use it to recreate their own bodies.
Sounds like heavy stuff, right?
One of the best things about this series is that it manages to provide some great humor that actually fits quite nicely into its overall dark premise. There are some definite lighthearted moments, but never at the cost of plot, and they never take away from the genuinely touching or tragic scenes. The story itself is very enjoyable, and tends to explore some very deep themes, such as the ethics of resurrecting the dead and the effects of war on individuals and societies.
Storyline aside, this series is visually stunning. Every cell of animation is detailed enough to almost seem like live action, and the characters themselves, based closely on manga author Hiromu Arakawa's original designs, are positively beautiful in motion. Some may be slightly bothered by the atypical face structures, but I find that they range between unnoticeable and and an improvement over the original series'. The movement is fluid and natural to the point that the opening alone should be enough for any animation enthusiast to be satisfied.
Characters are very entertaining. The very best, as I can assure you from following the manga, are a bit down the road, but the cast as of two episodes in are more than enough to tide anyone over. Roy Mustang is the perfect blend of snarky and serious, with a bit of eccentricity thrown in that any fans of the original anime series should be well familiar with (Tiny Miniskirts will almost assuredly make an appearance in this series once more,) and Edward Elric's familiar short temper, large ego, comedic frustration and occasional moments of genuine caring blend together in what is shaping up to be even better than last time.
One interesting thing about this series is the very first episode. It chronicles the events of an incident in central involving Isaac McDougal, a State Alchemist turned rebel after the Ishbal War, also known as Isaac the Freezer for his water-based alchemy specialty. This was never a part of the original Manga, and indeed only invented to keep audiences from experiencing Deja Vu from the first series. However, it is of such high quality and entertainment value that calling it filler would be downright unfair. It sets the stage for the rest of the series wonderfully and lets you know right away that you're in for a wild ride.
In short, this is a series to stick with. It's already fantastic, and I can assure those of you who have never read the manga that it only goes up from here. A definite 10/10.",10
"
                I have followed both the anime and manga of FMA for years, simultaneously. The first anime adaptation was satisfactory, but left a bad aftertaste.
Enter FMA: Brotherhood. Now this is a spectacular adaptation worthy of the manga; this is the epitome of a masterpiece anime. The series is just the right length; the storyline never drags, or falters. Although FMA:BH is strung together with an incredible strong plot, the characters are the real highlights of the series; the majority of the cast is thoroughly fully fleshed out with dilemmas worthy of our attention. And while author places nearly all major characters in perilous decisions, and they
                  oftentimes follow through with these heinous choices, one cannot help but offer up sympathy to these fictional characters. There were many times where I frowned upon some of their judgement, but I often found myself contemplating: Could I have made a better decision if I were in their shoes?
The Elric brothers are amazing protagonists to follow in this splendid coming-of-age story. In the end, many of my values in regards to adults, decisions, and moral choices were uprooted, and I find myself realizing that more and more, life is less black and white, but moreso filled with shades of grey.
Definitely watch this series. Might I add, some of the soundtrack borrows from classical pieces such as Chopin's Etude Op.10 No.3, which only made the emotional scenes hit me *that* much harder.",10

                Ah, Fullmetal Alchemist, what an amazing ride through the world of alchemy, I'm not surprised at all it is #1 on MAL, since it also is, and probably will be, at least for a long time, #1 on my list.
 If you're reading you probably came here looking to see if you should watch this anime or if my opinion is the same as yours, and please do not forget what this is, MY review.
Let us start with the best: The story - 10/10
Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood's plot is the most incredible thing I have seen in an anime, seriously, If i could, I would go and
                  meet Hiromu Arakawa and thank her for having an amazing imagination and ability to create and draw this masterpiece. You may be thinking ""Another fanboy, better find a real review"", and well, maybe you're right, but I have to praise what deserves to be praised, and this certaninly does.
 Sure you can say the first episodes were a bit rushed, but wouldn't people still complain if they had slowed it down instead? For me the pacing of the story felt natural and that they did not need to waste the beginning of the series explaining the story since it is slowly explained as the anime progresses.
The Art - 10/10
Sometimes an anime can feel a little off when the art style does not please our eyes, even though the story is actually good, but this is definitely not the case. The art style is really enjoyable and I just loved those round faces!
The fight scene, don't even get me started! The animation is gorgeous and Bones sure knows how to deliver well-animated fights with amazing angles and details that really make the watcher enjoy what the're watching.
The Sound - 10/10
I can tell you this: I have every opening on my cellphone and I regularly listen to the ending songs and background music when I feel like listening to those serene and beautiful soundtracks or the epic songs from the  several fight scenes. The voice actors did an amazing job with every single character, and even though I did not watch the dubbed version, I did watch a couple of bits on youtube, and it sounded pretty well too. I don't think there's much else to say here, top notch as always.
The characters - 10/10
The second best thing about Fullmetal Alchemist is it's characters. Every single character has a completely different personality and exceptional development, each one having their different reasons to act the way they do.
Even the villains are awesome, with their dark stories and troubled personalities that make our heros' journey be long and troublesome. It also has the best main villain of all time from any anime I've seen so far, that's a +1 right there.
Enjoyment - In case it's not obvious by now, 10/10
I enjoyed every single episode from this amazing series which left me sitting on the edge of my seat with all the plot-twists and cliffhangers that followed the previous one, that with the awesome animation quality by Bones, beautiful soundtracks and lots of relatable characters with funny, troubled, brave and heartwarming personalities.
Overall - 10/10
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience that managed to surpass it's other version's ""awesomness"" and show us what anime truly is about, and that's how it managed to reach my #1 spot, truly a masterpiece that won't be forgotten anytime soon, at least by me it won't. :)",10
"
                I'm going to be completely honest here... this is my favorite anime I have ever seen. Why you ask? Simple: (besides a few irritations) there is nothing wrong with this show.
The story follows two brothers who live in a corrupted country in a world where alchemy is possible. After their mother dies, they try to perform the ultimate taboo of alchemy: human transmutation. The transmutation backfires and the younger brother (Al) loses his entire body and the older brother (Ed) loses his left leg. In order to bring Al back, Ed sacrifices his right arm to bond Al's spirit to a suit of armor. Now,
                  with Ed having a mechanical arm and leg, and Al having a suit of armor for a body, they are willing to join the corrupted military in order to find a way to bring each others bodies back to their original form. Now tell me that story doesn't seem awesome to you? Story: 10/10
The animation is simply fantastic. Since FMA:B is considered to be on the more ""shounen"" side of anime, animation is key to it's success. And, boy did they hit the nail on the head with the beautiful animation. Art: 10/10
The dub is absolutely amazing! FMA:B has arguably the best dubs ever made. It is one of the rare instances where the dub is just as good as the sub, so watch it either way! As for the sound track? Oh my gawd... you haven't experienced true awesomeness until you've heard FMA:B's main theme! Not to mention that every single opening is absolutely breathtaking. Sound: 10/10
One of the things that makes FMA:B so awesome is that everyone has a purpose behind their actions, and there is no such thing as a ""dull"" character in this anime. Even the biggest antagonist have a goal they are trying to accomplish, making even the biggest villains lovable. Characters: 10/10
There is never a dull moment in FMA:B where they just sit around doing nothing. There are rarely ever any filler episodes (if any at all), leaving the show to become full of wonderful twists and turns that will drag you in right away. Enjoyment: 10/10
Does FMA:B have some flaws? Yeah, I guess. However, most of these flaws don't exactly work against the show as a whole. One of FMA:B's biggest flaw is the first ten or so episodes. It's not that they aren't interesting (trust me, they are) but rather they often can't tell when to be serious. However, even this flaw is something that anyone can look past, since the show itself is so enjoyable. 
To recap, FMA:B is nothing short of a masterpiece. The story is touching and sends a meaningful message. The art is breathtaking, and makes the action scenes that much more awesome. The soundtrack is a masterpiece in itself, and the dub is critically acclaimed as one of the best dubs ever. All the characters have so much depth that it's impossible to hate a single character of this anime. Finally, the anime was just flat out enjoyable from start to finish, grabbing the viewers attention from episode 1 and becoming more and more interesting as the show progresses. Overall: 10/10",10
"
                There isn't much more I could say with all the praise it already has, but I truly believe that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood deserves every bit of it.
The pacing is phenomenal; filler is minimal to nonexistent and every episode serves as another step forward. I know a few people who thought that the first few episodes were not explanatory enough, but one of the great things about it is its lack of unnecessarily long narratives; it gives you just enough background information without petulantly walking you through it.
FMAB is also one of the only anime that I prefer the dubbed version over the subbed. The voice
                  actors are fit fantastically in their roles, and the openings and endings were, for the most part, great. The animation was gorgeous as well, especially in action shots.
But I think the most important thing to be taken into account is the plot and characters. At its center, FMAB is about two brothers who have just enough flaws for you to emotionally connect with them, but not so many that it crosses the boundary into overly annoying. The length (64 episodes) allows for steady character development, whether it be for the better or worse. Even the villains have some sort of depth without making it seem like a rushed pity backstory. It can sometimes have crass humor (which serves surprisingly well as comic relief), but it is also harshly realistic; good people die and there isn't always a good reason for it.
So go watch it! I hope you'll love it as much as I do.",10

                ""You have to believe in yourself. Because if you don't believe in yourself, you will not only bring down yourself, but also many others that believe you and depend on you.""
It may not be a quote directly cited from the series, but it is one of the things this series has taught me. This show was great from start to end, and despite knowing some spoilers beforehand, it still delivered to a 10 out of 10 rating - something that's not usually happening for a shonen anime because they tend to overuse a certain trope.
To kick off, I have been fairly reluctant to watch Fullmetal
                  Alchemist: Brotherhood, because I have already seen the first series before the remake happened, and I was afraid that half of the anime would be the same as season 1, but since I heard it had rave reviews, I have put it in the corner of my plan to watch list anyway. Some long time after that, I heard the threat that many anime sites are going to be shut down, and I panicked by mass-watching anime and reading manga. Fullmetal Alchemist was one of the anime I started to watch during that period.
The story was admittedly a little predictable. But that might have been because I saw the first season, and a few spoilers on what happens ahead, or it might have not been. Despite the fair predictability, the anime has still delivered a great dose of tension, drama, fun, light-hearted moments to not make me burst out in tears from the heavy dramatic ones, and also action - thus I believe majority of the viewers would enjoy. If anyone is discouraged by the 64 episodes, just start slowly, you'll notice it will consume you in no time, because this anime is one of the few that are neither rushed or way too slow-paced.
Some people say D.Gray-man sneaks around seinen territory, but not nearly as much as this anime. The plot gets into a fairly dark theme at times, sometimes even gets slightly into political matters...  and the art matches it well. The colors are not very vibrant, which might have taken a toll on the character designs - then again, this toll has made the characters even more believable and gave distinctive features to them and their descendants.
The soundtrack matches the mood of the anime in all possible moments. Violin is used for several melodies of the soundtrack, which make a perfect match for the dark theme of the anime. As for the openings and endings, they consist of catchy songs, which serve as a great introduction/outro of the episodes. I also have no remarks to the seiyuus, as they did a fairly well job to match the characters' profile.
With matching art and matching voice actors, it is possible to admit the fact that the profile of the characters is constructed to be fairly believable - they have their ups and downs, and it is possible to tell where the characters ""got that attitude from"". Their reactions are also believable; they do not overreact as much as it happens on other anime of this genre. I would cite a few examples, but I'd prefer to avoid any spoilers so you see that for yourself.
With all that overall, Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood was a very captivating and enjoyable show, captivating me enough to take much breaks than most anime I have watched. I believe the masterpiece rating is indeed deserved for this one, although I wouldn't quite recommend it for starting audiences, as it would make their expectations of other anime series too high... then again I'm just kidding! You probably won't regret watching this one whatever audience you are from, but I can't tell you that for sure - you'll have to see for yourself.",10
"
                This anime is going in the All Time Favourites List along with the other classics, you know like one piece, naruto, bleach, dbz and all that stuff.
I'm not comparing with them though. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) is not exactly like them. It is not the usual 'go on an adventure' type with dozens of episodes and fight scenes that all look the same. FMAB is more story-oriented and tactical.
First, the story is very well wtitten and everything is properly planned out and coincides with each other bringing out every element in the right manner at the right time. The concept is really good with the
                  right blend of fantasy and reality.
Although the brothers are the focus of the show, each and every character has a role to play and help develop the story accordingly and develop themselves as well. This keeps the viewers alive to every character.
The soundtracks are soo cool. You would love atleast 4 of 'em.
I am not bothered by animation/art, but it is really good though.
I also liked the fact that there were some great statements and quotes about life, you know.
Not to mention, FMAB is one hilarious anime!! Then a little bit of drama and a little bit of a romance here and there gives it a proper outfit. I could recommend any type of person to watch this anime. For me it has become one of the classics
I saw this show when I was small and liked it instantly. Because I didn't see it properly I saw it again, and boy, was I glad I did! I loved every bit of it. Now I wouldn't say it doesn't have flaws, but why be a nit-picker when it is so enjoyable. No anime is perfect to everyone's mark afterall, eh",10

                Story: Well this story is nothing short of amazing. It is so entertaining, and just interesting to watch. The comedy, and action are outstanding. It all blends in perfectly. Some moments are more breath taking than others, and I mean that in two ways. 1. The comedy often had me in tears, and breathless because of how hard I was laughing, and 2. Heart filled moments just hit you like a damn bus. 10
Art: Oh my god the art is great. I am sure there were some flaws, because there are flaws in everything, but honestly if there were flaws I never caught them. The
                  character design is great, but even just the scenery is fantastic. 10
Sound: The ost for this show is perfect. The voice acting for it is also perfect. I don't think I have watched another anime where I love the Japanese voices and the English. Fantastic job from everyone. 10
Character: Oh my god again perfection. The characters are all great. You basically grow up with Ed, and Al. There physical, and mental transitions are so subtle that you really feel like you are watching them grow. Some anime have time skips where they just skip like seven years and then just throw you in, but not This anime you watch them grow it is amazing. 10
Enjoyment and overall: My enjoyment is through the roof. FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a masterpiece that I think is going to stand the fates of time well. I was never bored like I am with some anime. I was always hooked. My enjoyment and overall score are both 10.
If you haven't watched this series I really really really recommend you dive in, and just let it hit you all at once.",10
"
                I was dreading having to make my way through Brotherhood at some point considering my high regard for the first series and not really liking the manga adaptation's more conventional plot developments. But considering enough people were praising the daylights out of Brotherhood and some even boasting that the first series was no longer relevant, I decided to check things out for myself and see what got people giddy over this adaptation of the series. And after venturing my way through Brotherhood, I would have to say that those calling the first series irrelevant are ridiculous considering both titles have completely different takes on their
                  source material and the handling of them that whichever series you prefer would depend on what you are looking for in an anime.
In Brotherhood's case, it takes the Fullmetal Alchemist manga and makes a more closer adaptation of the source material which is quite focused on world building and creating a grand scale plot coming out of the Elrics finding out details about the Philosopher's Stone and eventually finding out about a national conspiracy and heinous plot connected to the Homunculus and powerful figures in the Amestris military. This take on FMA does follow a more conventional plot than the first TV series as much of the complex characterization found with prominent characters in the original series is greatly toned down with Brotherhood creating a more plot-focused series and morality with many characters being more black and white as the series has more purely ""good"" and ""bad"" characters with the former being always right in their convictions within the series and the latter having no redeemable traits and being wrong in their actions. With me believing that good characters in an anime should be morally grey with flawed heroes and villains with redeemable traits, I wasn't digging Brotherhood's conventional take on characters.
Brotherhood did have some elements that I did get some enjoyment out of. With Brotherhood being more focused on world building and plot advancement, the series expands more on the world of the series than what the first series did by introducing more branches of the military and some other countries neighboring Amestris, particularly Xerxes and Xing. This also allows the introduction of some new characters in the series with several characters from Xing and within the military that Ed and Al befriend and ally with when dealing with the Homunculus and the conspiracy they uncover. In addition, some characters from the original series who were underdeveloped and not having much screen time (Hohenheim, Alex Armstrong and Roy Mustang's men being prominent examples) are given more focus in this series, get some moments of fleshing out and are given bigger roles to play.
Still though, there are enough issues I have with Brotherhood that outweigh the praises I give it above. The show's first 12-13 episodes run at a fast pace providing little time to connect with characters introduced and with the events of those episodes having been portrayed in the first series, Bones appeared to have intentionally sped through the events to get going with what wasn't covered by the first series. With Bones more closely following the manga's storyline for Brotherhood, these earlier episodes had featured a major flaw to FMA manga-ka Hiromu Arakawa's earlier chapters in that her fast advancement of events gave little time for emotional investment from readers in regards to how characters reacted to major events that shook their resolves as the lack of time and depth on plotting in earlier chapters did kill their quality to a great extent. With the slower pacing and greater character focus found in FMA's first series, Arakawa had adopted these elements to a degree with her storytelling in later chapters which helped improve the quality of her writing.
I also found myself getting quite irritated with the show's comedy getting in the way of more serious moments. This was quite prominent in Brotherhood's earlier episodes where moments of slapstick and characters going super-deformed killed the suspense of serious moments. While the series does tone down on these moments in later episodes as the plot gets darker and more serious, they still pop up on occasion and when they do, I still found them to be a mood killer during most scenes.
Despite the praises I gave for new characters and expanded depth on underdeveloped characters who appeared in the original series, I couldn't give the same thing for a majority of other characters who appeared in the first series. Brotherhood's portrayal of these characters are more conventional and less complex as heroic characters aren't confronted with any possible flaws to their actions and personal beliefs; as well as all the villains being so shallowly evil that they're laughable and I could care less if they get beaten up and killed off.
The final episodes to a good extent also felt quite contrived with how things progress just to allow all the surviving characters to have a good ending. A number of moments were deus ex machina thrown in for villains to be defeated through means which the series never explored and they kind of cheapen how I felt about the hardships faced by the Elrics and other prominent characters to get what they desire.
In terms of presentation, visual details with Brotherhood are a bit simpler than the first series with color tones being more subdued. This is especially prominent with background designs in many shots as their quality looks quite washed out compared to scenery found in the foreground. Still, character designs of those from the original series still look the same as they were from over five years ago. While animation shortcuts are apparent in a good number of shots in Brotherhood, the series does have its animation highlights with the occasional fluid fight sequence and some good fight scenes involving Envy's true form.
For music, much of Brotherhood's insert music consists of stringed and piano pieces that do well at complementing the peaceful and intense moments seen throughout the series. On the other hand, many of the OP and ED musical choices chosen for the series consisted of some generic J-Pop and J-Rock that hardly grabbed my interest, though the first OP, Yui's again, did well at fitting with Brotherhood's mood.
Overall, I found my perceptions of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood to be no different from when I read the manga. It goes for a more conventional style of storytelling compared to the first FMA series and while it does have its moments of good quality involving character focus and world building, its more plot heavy and conventional focus drives it to lose much of the complexity given to prominent characters of the first series and the poor quality to its plotting in its beginning and ending episodes does kill quite a bit of the plot buildup that I would be expected to care about. While a worthwhile watch to those craving an epic-style action-adventure series or wanting a more faithful adaptation of the FMA manga, those wanting better characterization and solid drama with the series (in my case) would be better off seeing the 2003 anime adaptation of FMA.",6
"
                To this day my writing is influenced by Fullmetal Alchemist. I read the manga about ten years ago, but I still remember most of the characters by name. The author's vision and its execution were not without flaws, but the overall end result was sheer brilliance. The themes of loss, sacrifice and transformation are seamlessly integrated into the plot and character backstories.
What makes this story exceptional is how universal its subject matters are. Everybody goes through growing pains, but in the case of the Elric brothers Edward and Alphonse, their transition into adulthood is nothing short of hardcore. The boys lost their mother, who they
                  literally tried resurrecting, but in addition to failing miserably with the alchemical ritual, Edward lost two limbs and Alphonse his entire body. Turns out, despite the sheer magical potential of alchemy, it can't be used to bring people back to life.
There's a good reason why Fullmetal Alchemist has few peers. A story like this is impossible to create unless you've survived fucked up shit, possess the social support and intelligence to make sense of it and have the skills as a storyteller to convey those experiences. The author clearly thinks ill of shortcuts to personal growth (miracle cures, religion, etc.), evidenced by the first episode alone.
It seems obvious to point out the inspiration to this series is human darkness - even ethnic genocide makes it into the plot. It's astonishing how deep Fullmetal Alchemist goes with its harrowing concepts, yet rarely feels depressing. The characters talk about their emotions, then keep pushing forward, make new allies and grow as people. To be fair though, they don't actually get many chances to lament their misery, because the intense plot constantly whips them forward.
The main mysteries involving the plot are discovered shortly into the series, but the bad guys quickly clean house and cover everything up. This killing creates an incredible tension that sets the pace for the entire rest of the series. Not only that, but on many occasions the episode's cliffhanger is just brutal, reminiscent of Attack on Titan. Friendly advice: DON'T watch this series before bed, make the time to binge it!
The cast of characters is varied in genders, ages and body types. Their designs are focused and simplistic, though not without depth. Unlike how females are often drawn in anime, in Fullmetal Alchemist they look nice, but not overtly sexualized. There's also just about no fanservice. Even some of the evil characters are surprisingly humane, which indicates the author's ability for deep empathy. That's a real feat, considering the eyes she has for true darkness.",10

                Why do people give this such a high rating!
I saw FMAB because of the high rating and amount of praising. I was skeptical to see why it was rated highly. So, I watched it out of curiosity assumed that I would enjoy it because everyone else did. But, It’s so basic in writing that I feel bad for saying that. Also, I feel bad for saying this but FMAB fans just do anything to keep this anime #1 and they only say it’s good because everyone else says it’s good. when others animes with the same aspects of FMAB have way better storylines, characters etc.
                  So anyways, I came in with no initial thoughts didn’t look at reviews ignored the rating even though the score was quite high and look at what it was offering. Now for what it truly offers and it’s not a memorable experience. Not to say fmab is bad but it wasn’t as great as I expected it to be. After I finished I looked at the score and baffled at why the score was even this high.
Pros: Great ending.
Pros: Some characters are very well written.
Pros: Simple animation and art style.
Pros: English dub VA’S match characters voice. 
Pros: Great hand-to-hand fighting choreography, When there is hand-to-hand combat.
Cons: Basic story without strong story aspects as other shounen.
Cons: Underwhelming suspense/ Breaking point.
Cons: Comedy moments in serious moments.
Cons: Lots of caricature’s with 1 personality instead of multiple.
Cons: Pretty repetitive, Boring and predictable.
Cons: Underwhelming story for a long length shonen.
Cons: A lot of Uninteresting anticlimactic fights.

Story: 5 
 Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood’s story feels disguised as complex but it’s really simple. Now don’t get me wrong the premise is very interesting, “It is impossible to create something out of nothing. If one wishes to obtain something, something of equal value must be given. This is the law of equivalent exchange; the basis of all alchemy.”
Now the story is about 2 brother’s that lose there mom (Alphonse and Edward) So they use a alchemy technique called human transmutation a forbidden alchemy technique to bring there mom back from the dead without knowing the consequences. Alphonse loses his whole body while Edward loses a leg. Since Alphonse’s whole body is gone. Edward tries to bring his brother back by sacrificing his arm and placing a transmutation on a suit of armor. They are traumatized by what happened. They’ve lost their bodies and are in search of the legendary philosopher’s stone to get there bodies back. Now as bad as there poor suffering sounds. 
The story becomes so predictable because of Edward he is literally a beta male (too kind person) can’t blame Alphonse for following him. Besides he’s the younger brother anyways. They’re too kind to take risks for what they truly want. Since they don’t want anyone to suffer. Really hypocritical for them to continuously say that how they’d do anything to get there bodies back. Then someone sacrificed there life and they were still the same characters throughout the series WHY?? There were so many instances where they’ve could’ve got there bodies back. If i’m correct the brothers had contact with a philosopher’s stone over 5 times. But, Since the philosopher’s stone is made out of basically already dead souls and humans wanting to die the brothers just denied it because they don’t want suffering souls to suffer. That brings me to another point the story changes midway because of there betamale act. They give up on finding or trying to use  the philosophers stone.  They now want to go find another way to get there bodies back so then Alphonse gets memories of being dead and in “the gate truth” this randomly got brought up midway and they want to perform a stupid complicated way to get there bodies back. Also there was lots dumb tropes to keep the MC alive for instance. MC was on the verge of death because he was in a fight and the fucking villains said “Aye I think the kid is badly hurt let’s save him”. What an lazy way to add a trash filler character.
The climax is handled so poorly that it’s like eating rice and bread this one villain reveals himself and the person he revealed himself to (without getting to much into spoilers) was like “Oh yeah so you were the villain?” Then the person goes tells others about the villain they have the most predictable boring reaction. Now a Anime becoming predictable is not a bad thing. But, the way FMAB predictable aspect is handled makes The story becomes bland and uninteresting as shit because tension, suspense, Turning points are poorly handled that it just isn’t at all emotional it’s bland and once you think there is emotional moment it just lands a anticlimactic feeling after that. This just makes the story uninteresting. because there is no connection with how the characters are reacting.
Also, for the fairly long length of the anime it could’ve focused on Ling’s and all the other clans struggle deeper and made him more interesting. But, They barely explored his struggle which is unfortunate because it was interesting.
Sound: 7
The english voice actors match really well with the characters my compliant but the voice acting feels monotonous which I normally don’t notice in dub but I noticed here, Great Ost and soundtrack are played alot but I don’t really notice anything at all some ost’s are great I guess. But emotionally wise they ruin it with dumb comedy during dark moments or beautiful ones making it lose suspense while the series is playing and the jokes consist of the MC being short. Charming at first and quickly got repetitive. Some examples were a baby was getting born this is a beautiful moment. Yeah let’s throw a fucking side gag. 
Characters: 6
The characters are done so poorly they are basically like caricatures
They represent litterally one personality except Homheim and homucolus they are actually very great characters but they got bad character treatment. Still very amazing characters. For the sheer length of this anime they could’ve explored many characters. My compliant about Edward Elric has something very traumatic happened to him yet he doesn’t have a realistic side to him he just stays a betamale no development or change. That’s really unfortunate could’ve made a great MC because of what he went through. Also there were some characters used for Roy mustang’s development. But it was used in a lazy way that didn’t build character tension. Also Winry is probably one of the most poorly written characters. Anyways i’ll list off some caricatures:
Maes Hughes: “LOOK ISN’T MY DAUGHTER SO BEAUTIFUL”
Izumi Curtis: “I’M NOTHING BUT YOUR EVERYDAY HOUSE WIFE”
Alex Armstrong: Says Armstrong generation in every line.
Edward Elric: Beta male.
Barry the Chopper: A “I’m a evil villain” that’s goofy and can’t be taken seriously.
Art/Animation: 7.5
The art style is simple which i admire. As for the animation i didn’t notice anything wrong or bad. It was consistent but not flashy kinda of underwhelming because bones always has very amazing animation. for other series like MHA, Noragami and Mob psycho 100 Coloring looks neat. not much to say except it’s overall good
8/10 for art style and coloring 
7/10 for animation.
Enjoyment: 6
Now I was bored of this series 6 episodes in it’s just so predictable. suspense and tension couldn’t even covered  this because it was handled so boringly. it’s not fun to watch or gets you on the edge of your seat it’s a dreadful experience. Some parts are fun to watch sometimes the comedy can be funny. Animes and manga rated under 9.22 are way more entertaining to watch then this and have way better story aspects then FMAB. I kept I watched this anime just alone no other anime to distract my watching experience and took me about 3-5 months to finished. I found it mediocre and over scored. 
Overall: 6
This had some potential if it wasn’t a shonen a seinen more like it. Throw the side gags away, Expand more on the concept of alchemy make Edward a character that would truly do anything to get his body since that’s already a realistic goal. Make more interesting characters. They’ve could’ve did already interesting characters and their triats much better. Like Armstrong family history, Ling’s struggle, Make Izumi more realistic, Edward.",6

                “Mesmerizing, fun, funny, beautiful all encompassed in the –probably- most epic anime show of all history… in other words THE masterpiece.”
REVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!
FMA: Brotherhood THE highest ranked show on this site. But for me is something more important than that, so let me try this again…
FMA: Brotherhood THE FIRST anime show I ever watched.
Let me be honest with all of you, I started watching anime 3 years ago –and manga a few months ago-, so in all honesty I am a newbie, but since the start –my start- I’ve been able to watch some of the most fantastic histories/shows of my life, leaving aside
                  “real” –and by real I mean with actors in flesh and blood- shows like: Twin Peaks, 24, Lost and others.
I am lucky to have friends that have immersed themselves since children’s in the anime world, an those friends showed me an amazing way to start watching anime, and amazingly, now I’m doing this  review for a friend of mine –and of course all those- that want’s to start watching anime.
Since the first time I started watching FMA: Brotherhood I heard very mixed reviews. Some call this one a masterpiece, some others call it a shameful thing in comparison with 2003-2004 FMA version.  But for me both versions are amazing, but I hold dear this version a little bit more for being my first anime show.
FMA: Brotherhood is one of those “weird” anime that has everything and still their foundation holds perfectly because all the plots, all the drama, all the fights and scenes are “one for all and all for one” or in the words of the joker “They complete each other”.
So let us begin –finally- this review.
-STORY: 10-
To put it bluntly the story is neither great nor good. It’s fantastic, original –word that I don’t use very often- amazingly developed, in other words an EPIC MATERPIECE.
FMA: Brotherhood attempts –very closely- to follow the line designed in the original manga as opposed in the original Show. 
It’s a story of friendship, of brotherhood, of moments filled with happiness and saddens, of regrets and treasured memories it has EVERYTHING.
And it has one of the most –or probably- the most AMAZING ending of them all.
-ART: 10- 
In all honesty “huge pockets” will always save everything, whether a movie, a TV SHOWS or an anime.
It’s easy to see that the team that made “FMA: Brotherhood” a reality had a very good budget just by looking at the art. But let’s not “mess” with the amazing work made by the ART Designers of this show, for it doesn’t matter what we are talking about –in the art department- it is easy on the eyes. So beautiful and inspiring.
The characters are probably my favorite part/design in an anime that was made perfectly.
 -SOUND: 10-
Let me tell you this, FMA: Brotherhood soundtrack is the first soundtrack I downloaded -from an anime- it’s mesmerizing, it’s perfect.
If I remember correctly no other anime has made me sing their main theme: “Again” by “YUI” or a song like “Lapis Philosophorum”.
And most importantly it doesn’t matter if you watch the anime subbed or dubbed, it’s amazing.
It’s a soundtrack that is memorable, a soundtrack that can change the mood of the moment by itself without the need of words nor actions.
-CHARACTER: 10-
To call anything in this show “the jewel of the crown” is honestly a waste of time after all, the wholeness of the show IS THE “jewel of the crown”. But I WILL waste my time by naming the CHARACTERS of this show THE “jewels of the crown”.
Every single character is memorable and distinguishable. All of them are entertaining and most importantly everyone shines on their own way. Ed in all honesty is one of my favorite characters of all time, Roy Mustang is a character filled with life… wait EVERY SINGLE one is filled with life, something that isn’t easy to make, they shine whether individually or in a group. Enough said.
-ENJOYMENT & OVERALL: 10-
This is one of those shows that everything is perfect.
It’s a masterpiece, an anime worthy of your attention and love.
As I stated before “most epic anime show of all history… in other words THE masterpiece.”
That line is enough to describe this show.
 Thank you for reading.",10

                It's been one month since I had finished FMA:Brotherhood and planning to re-watch important fight in the weekend.
story(10/10):
Story is great, there are many emotional scenes and  strong brotherhood.
FMA: Brotherhood more closely follows the story line of the original manga, rather than the original television series which featured an original story line. Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric are raised by their mother Trisha in the remote village of Risembool. Their father Hohenheim, a noted and very gifted alchemist, abandoned his family while the boys were still young, and while in Trisha's care they began to show an affinity for alchemy. However, when Trisha died of
                  a lingering illness, they were cared for by their best friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako. The boys traveled the world to advance their alchemic training under Izumi Curtis. Upon returning home, the two decide to try to bring their mother back to life with alchemy. However, human transmutation is a taboo, as it is impossible to do so properly. In the failed transmutation that results, Al's body is completely obliterated and Ed loses his left leg. In a last ditch attempt to keep his brother alive, Ed sacrifices his right arm to bring Al's soul back and houses it in a nearby suit of armor. After Edward receives automail prosthetics from Winry and Pinako, the brothers decide to burn their childhood home down (symbolizing their determination and decision of ""no turning back"") and head to the capital city to become government sanctioned State Alchemists. After passing the exam, Edward is dubbed the ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" by the State Military, and the brothers begin their quest to discover the nature of the fabled Philosopher's Stone, under the direction of Colonel Roy Mustang. Along the way, they discover a deep government conspiracy to hide the true nature of the Philosopher's Stone that involves the homonculi, the alkahestrists of the neighboring nation of Xing, the scarred man from the war-torn nation of Ishbal, and their own father's past.
sound(10/10)
the sound before fight is so great.The ending and opening theme songs were also great.The respective opening and ending themes for the first 14 episodes are ""Again"" by Yui, and ""Uso"" (嘘?, lit. ""Lie"") by Sid. From episode 15-26, the respective opening and ending themes are ""Hologram"" by Nico Touches the Walls, and ""Let It Out"" by Miho Fukuhara. From episode 27-38, the respective opening and ending themes are ""Golden Time Lover"" by Sukima Switch, and ""Tsunaida Te"" (つないだ手?, lit. ""Tied Hands"") by Lil'B. From episode 39-50, the respective opening and ending themes are ""Period"" by Chemistry, and ""Shunkan Sentimental"" (瞬間センチメンタル Shunkan Senchimentaru?, lit. ""Sentimental Moment"") by Scandal. From episodes 51-62, the respective opening and ending themes are ""Rain"" (レイン Rein?) by Sid, and ""Ray of Light"" by Shoko Nakagawa. While episodes 63 and 64 do not use opening themes, they use ""Rain"" and ""Hologram"", respectively, for the endings.[6]
Animation(9/10)
animation is very good, every character is unique and not overlapping, many animes have similar face characters which is very difficult to distinguish on watching 1 or 2 episodes but in FMA:Brotherhood characters are so peculiar and great in art.
character(9/10)
character are neither too many nor too less, Elric, Edward and Elric, Alphonse are the main characters and present throughout the series.There are many other supporting characters.
Enjoyment(10/10)
There are many funny scenes when people  thinks Elric, Alphonse as Edward and Edward gets angry when he is called Shorty...Too funny
overall(10/10)
It's a great masterpiece anime.",10

                Full metal alchemist brotherhood the anime that has been called a masterpiece for so many years well to day I'm here to tell you my thoughts on that.Many people feel this way because it strictly follows the manga but just because an anime follows the manga doesn't necessarily mean its good.
Full metal alchemist brotherhood is about 2 brothers Edward and alphanse Eric. After attempting to bring their mother back from the dead using  human transmutation Edward lost his arm and leg while al lost his entire body and had his soul sealed inside a suit of armor the two brothers set out to find
                  the philosopher stone hoping to get their bodies back to normal.
Story- Now I will spoil some of the story in this review. FMAB started off pretty good then I realized a lot of stuff was not being explained the pacing was getting more and more shitty. Now many people say FMAB has a amazing story and its a masterpiece well It might've started off like that but it slowly evolved into a save the world from the big bad villain with a god complex kind of story. Now some parts in the story were very suspenseful and had my full attention. Then some parts of the story were really boring and I found myself zoning out continuously. The story had some really grasping scenes like when Hughes was murdered and when the guy with the blonde hair who loves to smoke(forgot his name lol) was stabbed in the back and was paralyzed for the waist down for the rest of his life and when Roy mustang flipped his shit and roasted Envy alive, those scenes were timed really well and caught me off guard. One thing FMAB did was focus on the drama to much which resulted in a shit ton of over dramatic scenes. Some of the dialogue was cliche and I couldn't stop fucking laughing because they were trying to be serious but I just couldn't take it serious, and I even started predicting some of the events in the story would happen. Anyway the story starts to go down hill and now the elric brothers new objective is to stop the bad guy who wants to obtain the power of god with them finding their bodies being their side quest. Then they have this cliche shounen ending where a seventeen year old kid beats the shit out of god. I mean this is just beyond cliche, the fight was good but i wasn't suprised because in the end i knew he would win. And the fairy tale happily ever after ending was disappointing to.   They never explained the origins of alchemy clearly nor do they explain anything else clearly so I was left with a shit ton of questions but no fucking answers. The story just didn't pull me in and It felt like I was just watching your typical action anime the story wasn't shit it just wasn't a masterpiece like everyone said it was.
Animation / Sound : The Animation was pretty good the character models and the back grounds were well done and so was the animation and art for the alchemy. The fight scenes where pretty neat but nothing too flashy. The voice acting was A1 I thought the sound effects for the fights and explosions were done well to. The intros and ending were just mind blowing sometimes I would just go on YouTube and just watch and listen to the intros. 
Characters: This is the weakest part of the anime.
Our 2 MCs Edward and Al do not change through out the whole series they remain the same naive little boys they were at the beginning hell the only thing that changed about Edward was his height he became taller as the series continued. Most the characters in FMAB get no development at all and some are just useless as fuck cough...cough... winry, now I don't dislike winry but sometimes she just annoyed the hell out of me and got in the way. The only characters in this show who got good development was Roy Mustang, Envy, crippled cigarette guy(forgot his name), hoenhime (I think I spelled it wrong), and Ling/Greed. Half of the villains on here are evil just for the hell of it and oh yeah the main villain with the god complex is called father he basically created the rest of the villains. Each of them are named after the 7 deadly sins and called homunculus. Apparently each villain represents a fragment of his soul you have
The homonculus were extremely shallow and were evil to be evil. I mean out of all seven only three shine and those three are Wrath, Greed, Envy. The rest are extremely uninteresting including father. If i had to compare him to a villain it would be Aizen from bleach. 
Now out of all of these villains the most memorable was Envy because of his hatred of humans and his twisted personality he was very exciting to watch and his death was put together really well. Now back to the other characters  Scar was very interesting at first but as the series continued he started to bore the hell out of me until I finally wasn't interested in him any more. Like I said before Roy Mustang got a lot of development he went from the cool and calm guy we know and love to a bloodthirsty animal obsessed over finding out who killed Hughes. Now full metal alchemist brotherhood has some interesting characters but failed to give them any development to the point where I didn't give a fuck if they died.
In the end by no means was FMAB a bad show no it was a good show that had a lot of potential but it failed to amaze me the unique story was ruined after a couple of episodes. I personally think this anime is overrated as fuck it wasn't bad its just overrated and it just didn't prove to be a masterpiece like everyone claimed it was  , but in the end this is just my opinion . The funny thing is I watched this before  the FMA 2003 version because everyone kept telling FMA 2003 was trash and the funny thing is I ended up liking 2003 more.   Do i recommend this show No you might find your experience different than mine after all we are two completely different people but i don't recommend it bruh. Well I'm done i hoped you enjoyed this review Peace!!!",4
"
                   Before I go into this review, I'm just going to say that I actually like FMAB. It is a good anime, and definitely a must watch. That said, there are just a few things about it that just rub me the wrong way.
   First of all, the story. It starts out dark, atmospheric, and complicated, just like the first anime, but unfortunately the story loses most of that atmosphere about a quarter of its way into the story, where as FMA was able to maintain that feeling of brooding tension from beginning to end. The pacing is terrible as well,
                  and the reason of this is also the main reason as to why the story loses its feel: the first act.  Arkawa wrote the manga in a fairly clean three part story;
-the first act (which concludes with Greed's spoiler)
-the second act (Briggs)
-the third act (Promise Day)
The problem with the first act isn't in its composition, indeed, in terms of composition I'd say that that the first act is the best of the three. Its all in the manner in which the story is told. The entire first act is blasted through in about 15 episodes, followed by a choppy, confusing transition into the second part. The rest of the story suffers as a result, as the second act is entirely plot driven with little space for development with the main characters, which in turn leads to the feeling that you're not actually watching a story as much as you are just watching people you don't care about do things for hours on end. The third act is admittedly outstanding, but there is still a slight feeling of indifference radiated by several characters and certain events take an absurd amount of time to come to pass. There is a reason for this pacing problem, that problem being that the show seemingly expects people to have watched the first series and tries not to bore them with the first act. Which is completely and utterly idiotic given the unbreakable golden rule of adaptations: never assume that the audience has seen the original or read the book. The ending is a mixed bag as well. Its undeniably satisfying, but it is also far too simple and happy for such a complex series.
   The cast of Brotherhood is a mixed bag, some characters (Ed, Alphonse, Scar, Izumi, Major Armstrong) are solid, but not as good they were in the original. Others (pretty much just Mustang and Winry) are better than they were in the original due to a higher level of focus and more interesting subplots. A few characters, unfortunately, are either boring archetypes or just plain useless. May Chang and Yoki have practically no purpose in the story other than to be love interests or comedy relief. There is no depth to their characters and no real purpose (May Chang does introduce a new kind of Alchemy to the main characters, but that could have also been done just as easily by Ling giving Ed a book or something), so when they get in danger or die, the audience has no reason to give a damn other than ""Well, I thought she was kind of cute."".  The worst character, however, is easily Olivier Mira Armstrong, and believe me (or hate me, which is probable) when I say that this character is the literal epitome of almost everything wrong with modern media. So many people these days fall in love with characters just because they subvert gender/racial stereotypes, which isn't even remotely close to being a reason to like a character (unless if you in turn are racist or sexist). Olivier Mira Armstrong isn't well rounded, has no character development other than a cliche growing of fondness towards her ""weak"" brother, and does absolutely nothing other than order others around and act like a badass (and by badass I mean backstabbing old guys and getting her ass handed to her by the dumbest character in the series). We never see Olivier laugh, cry, get scared, or do anything other. Good character my ass. As for the villains, there is some good and some bad. Pride and Kimblee are awesome, though I still prefer the orginal Kimblee. Envy is a decent one as far as generic psychopaths are concerned, and the Azula moment that he pulls against Mustang towards the end is spectacularly handled. Wrath on the other hand is a badass but forgettable, and his moment of goodness in the end felt horribly contrived. The big bad lead villain works, but is basically a less subtle Voldemort with a vendetta against God. Once again, badass, but forgettable.
  As far as art goes, FMAB is okay. Some things look a bit too round (Mustang literally looks like a five year old) and Edward's hair takes even longer to get used to. The action, animation, soundtrack, and voice acting are all brilliant and help ease you through the story where the pacing and the tension fails.
  Overall, Brotherhood is a pretty good series, as long as you don't think too much about the ending or tha pacing or the characters. Just enjoy the ride and don't expect the masterpiece that the MAL community might pressure you into believing it is.",7
"
                Okay, so this is only my third review at this point, meaning that my reviewing pants are still a little tight and don't cup the goods just right yet, but I'm a firm advocate of sink or swim and, this being a review of one of the most popular [and currently highest rated] shows on MAL, I figure that I'll either be met with wild success or consigned to the murky depths of obscurity.
Right, so I'd like to go into this saying that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shining beacon of hope amongst the fetid mire of what counts for shounen today. My own personal
                  biases aside, I have never seen an anime that so completely earned its rating of 10 by being so consistently competent in just about every category. The merits of its predecessor, Fullmetal Alchemist, may be widely disputed, but there is no doubt that Brotherhood is one of the best anime that I've had the pleasure of watching and arguably the most well rounded shounen out there. Now, being the pleb that I am, I've never actually read the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, and therefore cannot attest to how closely the show follows it, but those of you who watched the original will find that, up to a certain point, it treads pretty much the same ground as its predecessor; beyond that point, the two stories diverge wildly with the introduction of the neighboring country of Xing [China, basically] and the squinty-eyed badasses that hail from it. On an off note, I always thought it odd that, in most anime, the Japanese characters look for all the world like young white teenagers, but when you introduce a Chinese guy, it's all ""harrows"" and squinty-eyes from there.  At any rate, the Xingese characters really put the militaristic regime of Amestris [the setting of most of the story] into perspective, but I'll get to them later.
The story itself is excellently paced, chronicling the Elric Brothers' journey to get their bodies back and their subsequent discoveries about the nature of alchemy itself. This sets the perfect premise for an exciting story that explores the consequences of human transmutation and the myriad of other complex moral issues presented by something such as alchemy. It also [frequently] touches on the physical and emotional repercussions of war, and the use of alchemists as a military asset, but my favorite part of the story is perhaps that it finally elucidates on Houenheim, the boys' father, who was an enigmatic figure throughout the entirety of the original, and his curious relation to the show's behind-the-scenes antagonist [of whom, by the way, is far more interesting than the original's]. I would elaborate more on the story itself, but I'll abstain from it for fear of spoiling any plot twists or revelations, of which there are many. The only real complaints that I have are that FMA:B suffered once or twice from your typical stilted anime dialogue and odd anime morality. This isn't to say that the characters weren't all consistent and believable in their decision making, they really were,  but there was one point where a character, in an incredibly justified fit of rage, was about to kill someone who clearly deserved to die [that he'd been looking for throughout the whole show in fact], but was stopped. Why? Because afterwards he ""wouldn't be the same."" I imagine not; he'd probably have quite a load off his chest and walk with a little more skip in his step in my opinion, but everyone else may as well have been quoting Star Wars, what with their ""if you strike him down in anger, then you’ll give in to it yourself,” as though avenging countless lives is paramount to joining the Dark Side. I'd say that scene was absolutely confusing, but it actually contributed to an interesting bit of characterization for one of the bad guys; and besides, only a Sith deals in absolutes. 
Another [in fact, the only other] gripe that I had was with how they treated the beginning, which, as I mentioned before, is roughly the same as the original's [which was quite dark], except for some reason they thought it’d be a good idea to throw more Cartoon Faces in there. I mean, I understand throwing in a little humor for the sake of levity when things are getting too grim, but when a girl is contemplating murder after being coerced with promises of reuniting with her deceased boyfriend, having her aim at the wrong person just to throw in another ""haha, Ed is short"" joke doesn't quite cut it. Not to mention that one of the times Al went into ""cartoon"" mode during a funny scene it struck me that he looked an awful lot like a big grey condom, a thought which I just couldn't shake off for the rest of the show. Aside from that, the story is pretty much flawless.
Interestingly enough, while Ed and Al are obviously the main duo, what with them being featured prominently on the box art, they can't really be said to be the only main characters. Brotherhood also follows a fairly sizable cast of interesting characters, showing no particular favor to any one of them, instead opting to diligently flesh out each and every one of their individual journeys; including among them an ambitious military officer's campaign to root out dangerous enemies on the inside and rise among the ranks of his fellow soldiers to the esteemed title of Fuhrer [which I understand sounds suspicious to anyone post 1945, but despite obvious comparisons, Amestris isn't Nazi Germany], to the survivor of a domestic genocide [okay... maybe it is] and his quest for vengeance, with a whole array of compelling characters in between. 
While I'm on the topic of characters: if you were to ask me which of those  were my favorite, I'd be a genuine loss; every one of them is consistent and interesting, and they compose what is certainly one of my favorite casts in anime or media in general. I must, however, award special merit to a few: King Bradley, for perfectly encapsulating all that is man; fearless, pertinacious, and unrepentant. Riza Hawkeye and Roy Mustang, for being the most well-rounded female character and the most relatable badass respectively. Houenheim, for having a beard worthy of Rider himself, and...
Actually, you know what? Never mind, all of them were amazing. Not to mention that FMA:B sports the biggest cast of female badasses that I've seen since Black Lagoon. A few characters are necessary to mention however, such as the new Xingese characters, Ling Yao [and his guards Lan Fan and Fuu], and Shao May [possibly one of the most refreshingly competent kids I've seen in anime], who are introduced around the time that Brotherhood starts coming into its own, and add a lot of supplementary lore about the world surrounding Amestris; also the Homunculi, because I really enjoyed how most of their deaths seemed to be accompanied by some underlying theme that corresponded to their respective traits. While there is so much to love, the thing that I find most impressive about the characters is that seemingly all of them are relevant. Honestly. I can't tell you how many characters were introduced that I immediately pegged as throwaways, but come the end of the show there they are, doing things. Important things. No single character can be considered the product of bad writing and they all experience growth and development in their respective arcs, oftentimes as a result of their novel interactions with the rest of the cast. By the way, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the battles, this being a shounen and all. The animation is top notch for the fights this time around and you can tell that the development team went all out on each and every one; this show sports some of the most well animated fighting that I've seen. Not to mention that the action is pretty clever, and revolves around the use of tactics as opposed to power levels, meaning that the winner of any one confrontation was entirely circumstantial and therefore appropriately suspenseful. Every encounter is fast paced and exhilarating, and thankfully so, because there are plenty of them.
Lastly, the music and voice acting are superb. I personally watched Brotherhood dubbed, and would highly recommend it myself, because how often do you get to enjoy a genuinely outstanding dub? I tried the sub as well and found the voice acting similarly inspired; I really only chose the dub for the sheer novelty of actually getting to listen to a competent English cast. Each voice actor did an amazing job and matched their character perfectly. Ed and Al were voiced splendidly, easily conveying an entire range of emotions, Bradley was a warm family man and a menacing leader in the same breath, you could hear Roy's pain at his past molded into fuel for his ambition for the future, and of course, I could listen to Alex Louis Armstrong FOR GENERATIONS! The music was likewise impressive; this was actually one of few anime where I listened to every single opening song, every time. The OST as a whole was grand and, though some were perhaps initially overused, I never once found the BGM to be jarring or unfitting to the scene. Brotherhood also knows when to use silence; a valuable skill that many shows haven't quite gotten the hang of. Absolutely no qualms in the audio department.
All in all, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant pool of trite shounen anime; the story is captivating, the fights are thrilling, and the characterization is exemplary. Sure it may have its flaws, like that stupid “no confirmation of [romantic] feelings [to each other] until the very end” thing that anime does, but that’s a minor thing when compared to the tour de force of competency that is Brotherhood. There’s a reason that it’s resting comfortably at #1 after all.",10

                I, personally, love everything about Fullmetal, for not only is it an amazing anime, full of an incredible amount of heart and soul,  but it was also the first anime that really introduced me to the beautiful world of manga, anime and Japanese culture. Whilst not being the first anime i ever watched, (dragon ball z being the first, followed by Nartuo (which i personally never really liked), it was the first anime that i completed fully. So, to my surprise, in 2010, after about a 3 year break from anime, when i came across the title Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, i was surprised that
                  the story wasn't over yet, (i never had access to the internet until the age of 13, this being in 2010, and the library where i got my manga didn't have the complete volumes of Fullmetal), yet i decided to ignore it, only until recently i decided to watch it, due to my passion for anime coming back in 2013, and i gotta say, every moment, every minute was absolutely astonishing and to this day Fullmetal Alchemist will always have a special place in my heart and will always be my favorite anime. :3
Story: The story of FMA:B is basically the tale of 2 brothers, Ed and Al, who after performing a forbidding type of Alchemy called  Human Transportation to bring their dead mother back to life end-up not only failing to bring their mother back to life but also sacrificing their bodies, Ed losing his arm and leg, whilst his brother AL is locked to a suit of armor. The story of Fullmetal Alchemist is rich, full of brilliant themes and ideas that at times can be absolute tear-jerkers, to dark undertones, such as genocide, corruption, lust, greed, envy and wrath. The whole story is essentially a journey to reclaim what has been lost and a chance at redemption (for example ED AND AL trying to re-gain their lost limbs). Everything about the plot to full-metal is almost flawless, the ending is absolutely spectacular leaving absolutely no plot holes. 
Art: the art is simplistic, yet captivating. I absolutely loved the art style, i found it very re-refreshing and the character designs where amazing, all handled by my personal favorite animation company BONES.
Sound: The music in Fullmetal is absolutely brilliant, especially the opening and closing songs. All music does a fantastic job at showing the themes and the underlining feel of the show, a chance of redemption and to find what has been lost. Over the Dub and the Sub, for fullmetal, i would have to go with the DUB, every performance is top-notch, not one bad bit of dialog, yet you can never go wrong for the 2, sub and dub, both are top-notch. 
Characters: i refuse to explain how incredible they are, watch it, for the love of god, watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
Enjoyment: I gave the anime a goddamn 10/10, i love almost everything about it.
Overall: WATCH IT, READ IT, BUY IT, worth all of your money.
(compared to the original i believe they are both amazing peaces f work that must be seen)",10

                While FMA brotherhood offers an overall neatly wrapped full experience in anime and is a very easy anime to watch and be entertained by, it seems like many of the series'huge flaws which hurts its overall artistic quality are either being glossed over or are just not being talked about enough. In this review, I'd like to mainly address these issues and hopefully bring forth discussion. Is the anime good? Arguably, yes, it has a lot of great crowd pleasing aspects. Is it perfect and deserving of a 10/10? Sadly, far from it.  If this review sounds in anyway cynical and pessimistic, I apologize,
                  for I only think the pages of praise this anime gets needs to be balanced out with a bit of honest criticism. I also felt that I couldn't give an adequate critique without using points in the plot as examples, so I'm sorry in advance for there are some spoilers included. 
Firstly, I found that brotherhood was ridden with far too many lazy convenient plot devices and shonen cliches for it to be enjoyable. What do I mean by this concretely? (spoilers ahead) If you look at episode 34 isn't it too much of a coincidence that sloth showed up right when the Elric brothers did in the exact same room? Consider the area sloth has to cover and how many times he actually emerges, isn't it too much of a coincidence that he showed up at Briggs right when the brothers was at the basement? Rather than having a story which melds encounters together naturally and smoothly, we get a cheap device made purely to advance the plot on very questionable grounds. There are other examples as well where we can see characters coincidentally being brought together if you watch the anime again. This is a terrible example of bad story writing and plot advancement. 
What about shonen cliches? Just count the number of times in a fight where at the last crucial moment another character shows up to hit the enemy/ally to save someone. I realize that's a really badass shonen cliche, and when used sparingly, it can be somewhat epic, but in this one, it felt too tired and predictable.
The anime is also just far too naive and the actions and consequences of its characters are far too oversimplified. Brotherhood's predecessor might have its weaknesses, but it shines in it's realistic gritty overtones, and character growth in the Elrics as they journey through a bittersweet coming of age tale. In Brotherhood, there is only the illusion of character growth as they all have their respective emotional private dialogues, but these don't wallow past melodrama and towards episode 60, the elrics, mainly ed, are still the self righteous naive kids as they were when they started their journey. They don't murder under any circumstance for one but that morality is never explored because that's too much thinking and moral ambiguity confuses the audience I guess. In the original FMA, Ed had to resort to murder because of the situation and as dark as it was, the maturity was visible and there was a lot to be taken from that experience. 
Often times moral themes in this anime don't get explored beyond ""X is wrong so don't do it!"" just like that annoying scene towards the end (spoiler)where everyone tells Mustang he'll become a different person if he takes his satisfying revenge on the homunculus who's committed multiple unforgivable crimes against humanity, but never goes into depth about the nature of revenge or why Roy will become evil if he takes vengeance in this instance. The nature of Roy's revenge wasn't even an explored theme until this moment, and all of a sudden everyone gets on envy's side and turns their teeth on Roy for no other reason but to tell kids on the other side that acts like this is bad because it turns you into a fiend for some reason. Was I not the only one shouting for them to end envy's life already? This was after the blunder of them not ending one of the world's most dangerous beings before by ""putting him in a jar and giving it to a girl to be taken on a far journey"" without assessing all the risks properly. The homunculi were dehumanized in contrast to the original FMA and made completely unsympathetic (save wrath and old greed) , and we are suppose to sympathize for them at the end for some reason when they were made to barely unlikable? It seems like everyone protects envy throughout the plot. There is ""explaining morality through well written actions and subtext"" and there is ""preachy"" Brotherhood is definitely on the side of preachy.
Mustang as well as everyone else's involvement in the Ishballan war was also not exposed enough I felt. There was not enough psychological explorations on that dark. evil event in history. In the original, there were enough time dedicated to show us the gravity of what happens during war, specifically the massacre of innocents and the guilt state alchemists have to bear, but all that was glossed over in brotherhood, and I felt the weight of war in general was not conveyed well at all when the anime had multiple opportunities to do so. (not just the ishballan war, but the civil battle at the end as well) and instead, we get shallow melodrama, plenty of light comedic relief, and not much food for the mind for us to ponder on. It feels like at times, the anime is almost afraid to be depressing. Compare Hughe's death sequence in both versions and tell me the one in brotherhood has more of an emotional impact. 
Speaking of comedic relief, the chibi comedy moments in this anime really ruined a lot of potential serious moments. Often times, there was too much light relieving, there was nothing left to relieve but we get comedic relief'ed anyways. The atmospheric tones was much too inconsistent at key times where the director doesn't grip you in any major emotion for a significant amount of time.  For an anime which uses so much comedy, FMAB suffers from the curse of just not being funny. I get it, Edward doesn't like to be called short, ok, I had a chuckle the first couple of times it was mentioned, but for the gag to be in almost every other episode was just straight overkill. I found laughter more in the subtler gags such as ed's terrible design sense. 
Another naive and convenient moment was when all of kimblee's men happened to be good guys. They needed someone to rescue ed and be dependable, so hey, the two chimeras who were just trying to kill him a minute ago turns out to be genuinely good people because we'd have a dead main character otherwise. They couldn't kill the two chimeras in the room with scar who were tied up because the anime isn't dark enough to do that, so hey, Al trusted them at their word and they happened to be good people incapable of betrayal because everyone has good in their heart and just need to be trusted and the world is a great and simple place just like that! and just like that two allies were added to the roster out of nowhere because Arakawa couldn't write herself out of that predicament any other way.. changes of hearts are not gradual and realistic, but are rather handed out like Jesus pamphlets. Scar didn't have a second thought when the elders in his tribe whom he trusts questioned his actions, but switches sides just like that when he meets an ishballan soldier for the first time? I'm just suppose to buy that and go along? 
The author also ignores too many possibilities regarding the use of alchemy while writing this. In an anime about alchemy, you'd think it'd be used more. When Al and Marco's car got a flat tire at the end, where was alchemy? when ed and gang was fighting hoards of zombie homunculi, where was the alchemy to simply bind them to the ground or wall? when the gold toothed doctor was taking his sweet time to draw a transmutation circle, where was the simple attempt to clap the ground to disrupt it? These were all techniques shown to be utilized in earlier episodes but not used so the plot could unravel at a contrived pace which makes questionable sense. 
What the anime excels in is the fluidity of fight scenes, and the masterful animation with fine attention to detail all throughout, to the point where we can see the scar on Roy's hand healing scene by scene, episode by episode. I found characters in general to be paper thin and ill characterized because the episodes were more plot concentrated (but then again so was geass, but it dedicated enough time to character exposition at the same time) .I really wanted to like brotherhood...but really walked out feeling I just watched an above mediocre shonen which doesn't break the chains of its genre down to the last cheesy, sappy line uttered by its protagonist at the end.",6

                Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood is one of those anime that can be called ”unique"". FAB is an action,adventure,psychological,thriller,drama,comedy anime also having a slight touch of romance. The anime has done an exceptional work in combining all the geners and has balanced it perfectly.
FAB tells the story of two brothers who lost their bodies while trying to bring their dead mother back to life. So they go in search of a stone which amplifies the power of an alchemist called the philosepher's stone.
FAB has got an amazing story which makes you wanna keep on watching it and each episode has got its own twist. Every single episode is
                  crucial and even skipping one could make you totally clueless. Also, its got an unusual attraction and watching each episode will make you wanna see more. 
Then comes the characters. Every single characters are likable and respectable. As the story progresses there is a very good character development. The feelings, emotions, friendship, love and resolve of the characters leave a deep scar in your heart.
The anime has got a good Art. Also the detailing and the way the characters are potrait are all magnificent. The characters are potrait in a way which goes well with their personality.
The anime seems to be a perfection in whatever way you look at it. Especially, in sound. The voice given to most of the MCs are top notch and it matches the characters. Also, I think the English Dubbers did a good job, mainly Edward Elric's voice actor.
FAB is an anime which delivers a promise to the people that just reads its name. The anime is sure to give you a taste of some fine exitement and suspense. Unlike others, this one can be a treat for your whole family.
Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood is an anime having its own class. A mind blowing piece of work that can make everyone satisfied of their life. Personally I think FAB is a hundred times better than FMA. So those who haven't watched it till now can go ahead and watch it and I garuntee you that at the end of the series you'll definetly say 'AWESOME'..",10

                Have you ever gotten that feeling of overwhelming sadness once you finish an anime/manga because you know there will never be another one like it in its genre? That was the feeling I got when I finished Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
After the controversy of the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime deviating greatly from the manga, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was created as a completely faithful adaptation of the manga. Despite being a shounen series, Brotherhood adopts a unique, more mature approach to action shounen anime while still retaining the basic qualities of the genre.
The series takes place in a small, but powerful country called Amestris that mirrors Nazi
                  Germany. Amestris is a militaristic totalitarian country in which its most powerful figure (well, sorta) is the head of the military, addressed as Führer. There are many other historical references, including imperialistic desires, trench warfare, and an event similar to the Holocaust, and they help us to understand the situation Amestris is in at the start of the series.
The story follows the journey of teenage alchemists Edward and Alphonse Elric, brothers determined to get back their original bodies after a deadly accident following a failed Human Transmutation. As they try to find the legendary Philosopher’s Stone, an all-powerful item that can purportedly return them to their bodies, it becomes apparent that this mysterious object is tied in to every single conflict Amestris has been in. Unlike other shounens’ plots, which are tailored to maximize fighting, FMA’s plot is intriguing and full of genuine suspense. At its core though, the series is an endearing story about the resilient bond between two brothers who’ll never give up until they achieve their goal, despite seemingly impossible odds and obstructing obstacles.
In the series, alchemy is a blend of supernaturalism and chemistry that essentially takes an object and changes or transmutes it into a different object. A highly practical ability, alchemy can be used for medical purposes, fighting, building, etc. As an aspiring science major, this is one part of the series that really impressed me. For instance, there is a scene where Ed is forced to fight a character that can shield his body with diamond, one of the hardest substances on earth. After realizing the makeup of the shield, Ed transmutes the diamond into graphite (both are allotropes of carbon), a much more brittle substance. All the carbon atoms were still present, but now they were rearranged to weaken the shield. The incorporation of chemistry gives the fights so many possibilities. The Law of Conservation of Mass is somewhat applied to alchemy in the concept called Equivalent Exchange. Whatever the amount you use is the amount you receive. Of course, one of the powers of the Philosopher’s Stone is the ability to defy this rule of Equivalent Exchange, a reason why it is so coveted.
Much of the fighting in this series is relegated to close combat (until the final battle). Usually, the combatants are armed with some type of weapon, or if they’re alchemists, they can also transmute projectiles. But sometimes, the fights are as simple as hand to hand combat. Few people have truly unique abilities, especially since most fighting alchemists have similar abilities and the normal people can’t use any supernatural abilities anyway, so you won’t see crazy destructive powers like those of Naruto or Bleach. However, don’t misconstrue the fights to be any less exciting. The action is just as exhilarating, and with the inclusion of alchemy, we often see incredible environmental manipulation. Strategy is important, so the alchemic principle of understanding is sometimes crucial in fights. However, as a shounen that is more plot-driven than most, some of the fights are rather one-sided. After all, fights are supposed to be decided quickly, not take up several episodes and waste our times. Many of the fights serve to advance the plot, so more than anything, we see character development and learn more about the events preceding the series during these fights.
The characters are easily the best part of the series. There are many of them, and they all serve specific roles in the series. The most important ones are given fleshed-out backstories, and through these, we learn about their unique personalities, values, and internal conflicts, as well as get a sense of what exactly happened to lead up to the actual events of the series. Each character has some sort of goal that they hope to achieve, be it a return to a previous life, revenge, becoming the next Führer, or achieving immortality. The main antagonists of the series are the Homunculus, an immortal group of near-invincible creatures with human exteriors. There are seven of them, each one representing one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and much of their personalities and goals are based upon their respective sins. Their mysterious “Father” is the one who created them. These characters are far from one-dimensional. Their psychological conflicts and emotional backgrounds really help you empathize with them. In fact, Fullmetal Alchemist has spawned a number of my favorite characters.
Now, despite all the praise I’ve given to Brotherhood, it does have a few setbacks, although whether these can be called setbacks depends on the viewer. The show often likes to resort to light-hearted slapstick comedy typical of a shounen series. Accompanying this is the occasional use of the chibi style of art. Some people may find this aggravating, although I personally have no problem with it. Also, the pacing of the series is somewhat inconsistent. Initially, the series moves rather quickly, resolving conflicts in only one or two episodes. At times, this gave the series an episodic feel. However, the pacing becomes much more streamlined towards the middle. Towards the latter part of the series, the pacing slows down considerably, and the final arc pretty much occurs within the span of a few hours. Again though, I found no problem with this personally, and the way the show was paced at different parts worked well with the occurrences in the plot.
The music is very suitable for the atmosphere of the show, giving an eerie, serious, ethereal, heartwarming, tragic, or lively feel depending on the scene. It’s not exactly memorable though, but it works. All the OPs and EDs are fairly good as well. On the other hand, the voice acting is perfect for the characters, especially Ed’s voice. Emotions are flawlessly conveyed through the voice actors. The animation is also fantastic. The fight scenes are exciting and flow well. No choppy movements. Occasionally, the faces do look somewhat disfigured and disproportionate (often times Mustang’s), but other than that, the artwork is detailed and generally solid.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience. Its world is so intricate, but gradually, everything is explained in full detail, and it truly is beautifully crafted.  This isn’t just another shounen anime. Its incorporation of political, religious, psychological, and philosophical elements and its focus on plot over fighting definitely make it a much more mature series than your typical shounen. At the same time, its slapstick comedy and grand fights are the reason for its shounen tag, but that’s not a bad thing. Also, this is the only action series that has invoked any serious emotion in me, showing that I actually cared about these characters. It is unfortunate to see it end, but all good things must eventually come to an end. This is a shounen that’s done right.",10

                I have seen both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood) and both are good to watch. In the first version (Fullmetal Alchemist), the first half of the series is really good. The fight between Edward Elric and Roy Mustang & the State Alchemist test taken by Edward Elric are notable ones. In second half, the story takes lots of twists and turns and I find it is not as impressive as the first half.
Anywayz, Fullmetal Alchemist is, in a way, unique. It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairly
                  straight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance. These are all common staples of long running anime series that lean towards a more commercial and public appeal. And yet, for a mainstream series, it manages to continually surprise with a very mature and serious tone. There is a great deal of tragedy and some moments are even frightening and memorable. Few series achieve such a perfect balance of mainstream entertainment and gut wrenching drama and tragedy. 
And I will finish by saying that if you are going to watch one anime in the entirety of your life time, Choose FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood",10

                People tell me that I am too old for Japanese cartoons (those people are specifically idiots that prefer to say cartoons rather than anime). Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood aired 5 years ago so it classifies as an old anime but get this, I am never going to be too old and too late to watch FMA: B. 
For some reason, otaku members in MAL may or may not be tired of seeing reviews that has a score of ten in FMAB. To those who are sick of seeing reviews like this saying how awesome Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is, well you guys better get used
                  to it. After all, this show is by far the most epic thing I have ever seen in my entire life and I’m not just saying that because I am a fandom of it. The moment I first watched it, I was completely addicted and it became my instant favorite. (You may want to skip the third paragraph because I went through a long way before watching FMA: B but if you are interested on the story, fine with me.)
Okay, this anime was never my decision to watch and it comes with a whole journey of doubt. Last 2010, I was amazed after seeing Soul Eater and I became a huge fan of it. I used to go to this website called animecrazy.net (You guys may never heard of this website but it was removed some year ago or years ago) and it has this section called “Most Popular Anime of all time” and every time I view it I see Soul Eater at number 9 which makes me happy; however, as months pass, it goes to spot #13 and I was completely mad and to think the anime that beat Soul Eater was Fairy Tail and Full Metal Alchemist/Brotherhood. I had a huge grudge on those two shows so I promised that I will never betray Soul Eater (hardcore fan girl right?) but that assurance was broken until now. I watched shows that were really crappy before seeing Full Metal. For example, 12 anime shows that completely tell nothing but friendship and getting a boyfriend and some shows with potential but with plot holes and open endings. I never really felt so bored. Not even a single anime left me with an incredible impression for the reason that most of them never gave me a superb feeling like what SE handed me years ago. Until one day, I was watching Baccano! And saw a recommendation about Full Metal so I did it and broke my pledge. I deceived SE but I never thought that it was going to be my best decision EVER!
Full Metal Alchemist has a great story because each arc has a connection with one another. The first arc is the goal of getting Al and Ed their bodies back. The second arc is the villain’s plan which I will not tell you because I am not going to be a spoiler. The third arc is a clan’s mission in finding immortality in order to save their culture. The fourth arc is the anti-hero’s plan of seeking revenge on the military. If you think that’s all, think again. There are more back stories, more characters to invade, more unexpected happenings and more development on every character’s relationship. What makes it unique is that it uses Alchemy which is an ancient part of Chemistry (which is being taught to students of our era). Alchemy for some people claims to be magic of some sort but believe it or not it helped produced Chemistry that we know of today. This show is mainly talking about alchemy and it made it look so damn good. Some people will think that it’s going to be a boring show because it talks about a philosophical science but it is more than that. There will be a unexplainably awesome adventure for you guys with comedy, drama (lots of it), action, and surprisingly, a little subtle romance. I give the plot an outstanding 10 because face it, Arakawa-sensei made a story like no other. It is unique, incomparable and marvelous in a million levels. Sure, people will think that I am exaggerating a bit and yes there are flaws in this anime like there are some cliché ticks; nevertheless, it is quite different because there are no fillers and Brotherhood is straight to the point, a little fast paced and of course, the episode that capped everything is undoubtedly superior and satisfactorily complied with my expectations and even surpassed it. 
Aniplex and Funimation had become popular in every anime show. Both organizations never fails to amaze me with their techniques when it comes to graphics but I won’t lie, the art is just very good and it did its best for a 2009 show by depicting very iconic styles and motifs. The background can be a little simple like its lacking details and animation. The colors were just nicely done. They know when to make a vibrant scene and a when to put a shadowy effect. Everything was just balanced and pleasing. People may observe it as mediocre but it did a splendid job for the graphics. Considering how it has a more modern impact unlike the original 2003 FMA, it also has great animation schemes.
One of the best points in FMA: B is their OST or original soundtrack. Every anime that has Bones as their producer really has excellent music that you won’t absolutely ignore (take OHSHC, CB and SE for example). For the opening songs, my biggest recommendation and the song that I really liked is Yui’s Again. It has a rather lavishing drama and courage mixed into it. It has a dramatic entry at first but it has a catchy tone in the latter part of it. The third opening, Golden Time Lover is also convincing and fun to listen to because it has rock music and it is also upbeat and likable. The fourth opening is great too, Period by Chemistry has a slow and not too quick rhythm but it uses electric guitar as its main tune. The second opening is full hope and has more happiness into it. Rain is just too all over the place but the video that comes along with the song helps. It is good but it just wasn’t notable for me. The endings were just as grand as the OPs. The best among the rest is Miho Fukuhara’s Let it Out (which is better than Frozen’s Let it Go) because it is the song that never gets out of my head. It is very iconic and very dramatic. It made me cry so hard every time it plays with a very sad moment in FMA: B. I loved it so much and is willing to make it as my favorite Otaku song. Uso, Shunkan Sentimental, and Ray of Light were all good and aspiring to hear. The blend of RnB and Alternative Rock was splendid (am I right). For Tsunaida Te, I disliked it because of the rap that goes along with the piano it didn’t blend with the slow and steady melody. For the sound effects, some were quite repetitive but hey, that’s what makes it iconic and memorable. When it plays somewhere you’ll know that it is Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood’s soundtrack. The voice actors were flawless. They placed all the great emotions at the right time and the right place. Whether they need to be funny, sad, and emotionally fine they did it at the greatest quality as possible. Although, I am not fond of the English dub in many anime shows, FMA: B’s English dub was distinct. The Japanese dub is great too but the English dub was more hilarious. I was just a little concerned with Ed’s voice in the Japanese dub because Paku Romi is good at Edward’s younger voice but when Ed became a little older, she should’ve made her voice a little deeper but no sweat, she is a girl after all. In the English dub Vic Minogna’s voice was flexible at all costs. Kugimiya Rie and the English dub actors of Alphonse did an exceptional job (they were too many I can’t distinguish who was who). The others were awesome too making this anime lively and entertaining. 
Characters are also one of the strongest potential of Brotherhood. Of course, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric were a great main character duo. Both were entertaining and somehow have various personalities. Individually, they are different but both are awesome protagonists. The supporting casts were explicit from Roy Mustang to the villains. I didn’t hate any character in this anime. Each and every one of them was lovable and funny. Yeah, so some of them have the common personality like the pervert, the overly protective main character and the defenseless girl but somehow they are all fantastic when seen together and they also have unique characteristics. (Take Note: I mistook Edward as a girl and Al as a robot, I am so stupid, am I the only one though?)
If giving enjoyment an infinity I would've done it by now but sadly it’s only a ten. This anime has outstanding puns, dramatic parts, a little romance, overwhelming action scenes and an ending that no words could describe my feelings because it was the best one. (Thank you Arakawa!) FMA: B was the first shounen anime that made me cry. There were episodes that were just too intense that I never expected to shed a tear. The jokes were funny and were not corny. Yeah sure some of it was always shown but they place the jokes at the right time without confusing the person and making the viewers say “what the hell am I watching?” There weren’t too many ecchi scenes in Brotherhood because like I said it is pretty straightforward. Action scenes were not too dull. They preserved the specialness in every character’s strengths and weaknesses in order to give out their true power in the end. Romance? Well, I can't believe that it has one but don’t worry, the show doesn't focus much on the love story.  
With a great story line, lovable characters that you won’t forget, unmistakably exquisite music and sound effects, a different art and amusing parts there is no denying that you should really NOT miss FMA: B. I am not saying this because I am a fan, I am saying this because I am a victim of watching an extraordinary anime that never left my mind. I was thinking about this anime for like weeks now and there isn't a second or a minute that I never wait for the next episode. I will always admire this anime because of its strong capability to make a person learn about sacrifices and pain. Life is cruel but in the end, you’ll know that everyone needs to lose something to gain what you really want. Just like what Edward said, “A lesson without pain is meaningless” so you have to stand and endure it. You shouldn't miss Fullmetal but instead have the time to watch it and you will be captivated. It wasn't ranked as number one in MAL for no reason. Because of FMA: B, I finally learned to move on and keep moving forward. If you haven't watched it yet, you will lose half of your life and your limbs.",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist, a story about 2 brothers going on a journey in a magical fantasy world, which brings us as the audience closer to the interesting idea of equal trade. “Giving something in order to get something” A very realistic idea but in this universe much more effective. To make a material out of another, a dream of the ancient alchemist to create gold and probably an idea that will occur to us in a distant unknown future. Fullmetal Alechemist is an anime I only can look kindly upon. 
7 years after the original anime fascinated many of viewer studio “Bones” decided to make Fullmetal
                  Alchemist again, with slightly better graphics and more accurately to the manga and it seems like that Brotherhood is even better than the original, at least the majority of people on this website think so. 
I think it is quite understandable why the Brotherhood series is more popular and more liked than the original, at least on this website. It is also my biggest problem about it. On the one hand Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood had more action scenes and on the other it had a more complex but better explained storyline. That seems quite good doesn’t it? Well the problem is Brotherhood explains every detail of the story, as if the storywriters think the audience can’t think for themselves. The character constantly reminds you of several things so you absolutely can’t forget them. Half way through an episode it also has to remind you of the anime you are currently watching, with shouting its name out loud, just to make sure. This penetrating need to explain everything goes way beyond normal story explanations. Even though in some cases explaining the story by SHOWING you the story is more enjoyable in many cases it need to be TOLD, especially in anime that are character based and have a lot of conversations involved. Sometimes a story gives you the clue “A” and the clue “B” and you have to come to the conclusion “C”, sometimes it gives you a clue “A” and the conclusion “C” and you can, if you want come to the result “B”.  “Brotherhoods” doesn’t do that, it gives you everything and the character just screams the conclusion out as if they can’t wait until you know their secret plan. I mean what is the secret behind something you tell everyone? 
It just bothers me when villain out of no reason start telling you their whole plan, or what evil stuff they already did, especially when they don’t need to. Why would they do that? And when they tell you everything about their plan why do they stop there? Why not telling the audience WHY they did that, WHAT motivations they had? Maybe going a little bit into the depth of characters? Sadly we dont get any of that in this anime.
But let’s go to the analysis: 
The story had a more immature writing style. It’s not only the already mentioned dragging you in only one direction and don’t allow any open mind believe that make this anime immature there are more than just that point. The representation for example was very childish. You can’t take a show seriously that constantly includes comedy parts, with a funny artstyle, which doesn’t even spare villains. From the story part, compared to the original there isn’t any uniqueness anymore. The anime really tries to be in the shounen genre since it lacks of consequences, motivations and logic in many cases. Even though this anime explains everything there are still many open question to it, which are very important once, maybe even plotholes or contradictions and not some simple questions like in the original, which are a matter of your own creativity.  
The pacing for the show changes a bit. First it starts of very fast, as if it wants to go through the story that the original had as fast as possible, and then it comes to a normal pacing. Besides the fast start the pacing was quite enjoyable. The start was a pretty important and emotional part in the original. But Brotherhoods because of the rushed pacing doesn’t manage to create the same effect as the original at the start. 
Like I said before the animes main thematic is equal trade. It was everywhere in the original.  So many little details were made, from the beginning to the ending to bring this realistic idea which was presented in a fictive style closer to its viewers. The “Brotherhoods”-series lacks so many of these points. At the start you can see it, but the more the story progresses the more it goes lost until it’s completely forgotten in the end. It is unbelievable that the writer of the manga doesn’t even get the point of his own manga, why else would he make such a consequence free story.
The anime is also very popular because of its action scenes. But they are way too uncreative. Think about it, in this world they could make every material out of everything (at least they make steal out of stone, so silicon into iron + carbon(you also have to consider the high temperatures that have to be created), which is already hell of a transformation) It is idiotic to fight just with your “sword” when you have such an ability. You could create a vacuum or make the bottom liquid and then trap them. There are sure even far more greater ideas than that. 
But Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood not only wants to be shounen it also tries as hard as it can to be accepted for mature audience as well. The unfitting and forced inclusion of dark gore themes and making some appearances especially bloody, but sadly they didn’t manage to do that in terms of characters and basic of story. It’s a childish story wrapped up with mature themes, explained to the audience as if they were kids. 
A very big shounen inclusion and a very annoying story-part is the love story they written into it. In the original the fact that the blond mechanic chick is so unimportant to Ed is a very nice thing. It’s a story about 2 brothers going on a journey not a typical love story. Therefore the inclusion of such a thing only makes it feel like the storywriters tried as hard as they could to make it appealing to as many viewers as they can. And dont get me even started on how bad the consequence free, deus ex machina ending was... but it was pretty fitting for a  shounen anime.
The character are written more to appeal to a younger audience as well. You can clearly see that. Ed and Alfonse act only a little bit differently than in the original but its significant change made there. In the original they had childish attitude and believes, but unlike in shounen anime the show doesn’t give them the opportunity to change the world. The thing that bothers me about shounen anime is the fact that the storywriters take a childish main protagonist who thinks that he alone could change the world and the storywriters give him the ability to do that. The drama in such shounen anime is reduced to pathetic written melodrama and the invention of motivations hasn’t been done in any kind of way. 
But let’s go back to the protagonist and his brother. The thing is, in the original they followed a goal which they wanted to accomplish with everything they did. The grow over the duration of the show and get more mature. In brotherhood they rather help everyone out, what makes them common “hero-typed, being nice to everyone, expect for the bad guys”- characters. They never grow and never learn anything or change their behaviour.
All the other characters in Brotherhood are either annoying or unfocused or badly written. You have for example arrogant, very little knowing characters as the “good” guys, whom the storywriters use to explain the plot to the audience and we got emotionless, unmotivated and idiotic enemies who have not the slightest abilities to come up with a working plan and therefore aren’t able to create any threat to the audience.
Just look at Van Hohenheim. In the original a serious guy with a goal, for which he even could make sacrifices to achieve it. And a caring father for his children, while keeping his distance. He has his secrets which makes him interesting. In Brotherhood: A typical whiny guy, who cant see anyone dying and who wants to save everyone, without goal and with a past that is completely idiotic.
I also have to mention the homunculi, which are a very important group of character. For those who doesn’t know the original: The homunculi are the anti-heroes or the enemies if you like. The original gave them background story and motivations. Normally I don’t think it is important for an action based anime to go into the depth of characters especially villains, but besides the fact that Fullmetal Alchemist has a lot of character conversations it’s also every time a nice thing to do. In this case it feels also very special, since the homunculi represent the 7 deadly sins. Everyone acts like the deadly sin he represented which makes everything quite accurate and detailed.
The homunculi are now in brotherhoods not only rather unimportant but completely forgotten in terms of personifications, depth, motivations and everything else that made them likeable in the original. They have no background story or any kind of focus. 
The homunculi don’t act like the deadly sin they represented anymore. Envy acts arrogant all the time only saying he is envy, but there is no explanation why. Greed also has to tell the audience that he is greedy else you wouldn’t know. The characters have to tell you what they are, they can’t SHOW you.  The whole story has to be told to you to explain it and can’t be shown to you. And Wrath said something like: I’m proud of being a homunculus. Sloth is the worst of all because he is working overtime. In fact Brotherhood doesnt have any vilains that are interesting, or that could create any sort of threads. 
Artstlye and soundtrack of ""Brotherhood"" were very good.The animations looked clean and the backgrounds and characterdesign was very well and detailed drawn. 
Soundtrack was better in the original but ""Brotherhood"" had a lot of nice tracks as well. 
In conclusion Fullmetal Brotherhood was an enjoyable anime and maybe it would have been even a decent one, if there wasn’t already an anime that is the same thing, only superior in every important aspect. Brotherhood only shines in the shounen aspect with illogical inclusion, annoying overused character, lack of motivation or any kind of uniqueness and plotholes unable to count.",3

                You've probably heard of Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood, as it is widely known through the anime community as a fantastic and incredible anime. The main rule of this anime is of Equivalent Exchange; To gain, something of equal value must be lost.
So, what's the Story?
The story follows brothers Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric in a journey to find a mythical gem known as the Philosophers Stone in order to bend the laws of alchemy and receive the bodies they lost trying to bring back their mother after her death at the hands on an illness. That is the basics, though the second half of the anime is
                  very different and the story becomes a lot more serious and the entire tone goes from a selfish journey for their own benefit and turns into a massive story that is absolutely fantastic. 
The story of the anime, as a whole, was clear and enjoyable, and kept the overall feeling of the anime constant, always adding suspense, comedy, sadness, and any emotion possible.
The characters are amazing. From main characters like Edward, to background characters, each is given a motive, story and enough time to actually create a connection. Every character was understandable and somewhat likable or relatable.
The sub and the dub are both amazing, and the dub is one of the best ever for any anime, every character's voice is great, well used and memorable. Not a single voice sounds wrong. Every character sounds exactly like you'd expect them to and it makes the entire anime a lot easier to watch as well as a lot more enjoyable, creating a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. 
The animation style is incredible, fluent and beautiful. It works perfectly, and somehow they use the same animation style effectively no matter what emotion they are attempting to convey. Comedy. seriousness and sorrow are all presented fantastically
This anime is easily one of my all time favourite anime, and I have yet to meet someone who genuinely dislikes it. It's worth a shot, and I know you'll fall in love with it, just like I did. Watch it all and there will definitely be a least one character you love and at least one part of the story you will always remember.",10

                The original Fullmetal Alchemist was a fantastic anime back in 2004. It had a fantastic story, and amazing characters, but unfortunately, the pacing was slow, and the ending was somewhat bittersweet. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, it's remake, on the other hand manages to fix just about every problem the original had, and even manages to improve all the good points from the original.
The story of the Fullmetal is one not to forget. The story revolves Edward Elric, and his brother, Alphonse Elric, who are searching for a way to return back to their original lives after committing a dangerous taboo, human transmutation. The story revolves around
                  the idea that in order to receive something, you must sacrifice something of equal value. The brothers live in a fantasy-like militaristic nation that has a great focus on the use of alchemy called Amestris. This is an incredible story that uses it's time wisely, with just about every moment having a importance in the grander scheme of things. Not everything is as it seems, as they are some really clever plot twist you won’t forget. Despite the fact the the story is massive, it never seems to complicated. It explains everything in a way that it doesn't talk down to you, but you never feel like you've been given to much info to keep track of either.
The best part of the anime by far, are the characters. The show has a huge cast of likable characters, each with own interesting personalities. None of the characters feel like stereotypes, and they are all given enough depth to make them feel alive. There’s the main dou, Edward and Alphonse Elric, two brothers who are searching for a way to get their original bodies back, and their childhood friend, Winry, who is always making sure the two brothers are safe. There’s also the members of the military, Roy Mustang, a man who wishes to become the fuhrer of Amestris, with his devoted team, and a loving father and husband, Hughes. And, of course, the antagonists of the show, the mysterious homunculi whose motives see, unclear at first, and a man looking for revenge, Scar. I haven’t even mentioned the side characters. Ninjas, Alchemy teachers, engineers, and a runaway father. Hell, I don’t even know if I can call these side characters. They're all so important, with their own different goals and character development, they could be considered all to be part of the main cast. They are all so varied, you’re bound to have your own favorites.
The animation for the show is great too, although some might prefer the originals art style over this one. It looks a bit more simpler compared to the originals, but that’s mainly because the original had some fantastic artwork. I will say this, though. The animation is great and has some incredible action scenes, and nice facial expressions. The art style is beautiful as well, creating fantastic environments, with a great use of distinct colors. The animation does fall once in a while, but it’s so rare, you’ll hardly notice it.
And finally, the sound. This show has a fantastic orchestrated soundtrack, with solid voice acting. The anime has five opening and ending songs, and they’re all a joy to listen to. The music complements the show greatly. Every scene is backed up by a great track, giving them all it’s intended atmosphere. It can make scenes intense or relaxing, exiting or melancholic, and most importantly, meaningful. The only complaint I would have is that some of these tracks are played too often, but it never really bothered me. The voice actors for this show are great as well. There’s not really a weak voice actor in the bunch, and some of them really do help push the characters to seem more believable. You can’t go wrong with either subbed or dubbed.
I can’t stop praising this show enough. The show is incredible, with practically no flaws(I tried my best to even find the few nitpicks that I did find). You’ll end up finding these episodes passing by too fast, with these 64 episodes will all hold something memorable. This is not a show you want to miss.",10

                FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood was released in 2009 and it is a remake of the FullMetal Alchemist, where the story takes another path and twist from the original. Brotherhood is considered to be better than the original from most of its viewers.The whole animation has deep meanings as its designed based on facts and different cultures, Its not just a random put-together. It has a good way of transmitting the anime's emotions such as comedy style and drama, and will definitely make you laugh sometimes , and other times feel sad or even cry.
The anime consist of 64 episodes which by my opinion is a very
                  good amount that doesnt tire you and its not too short either. There are also some stand-alone side stories: Blind Alchemist, Simple People and Tales of the Master.
Graphics: The graphics on this animation are much improved than its predecessor. The graphics engine changed and if you watch this animation on more than 720 p you are gonna love it! The movement is smooth and the physic in the anime are as realistic as they can considering its a fantasy world with super extra special effects! It has Naturalistic colors which will not make your eyes hurt and the design of things around is pretty interesting as well. For an anime released in 2009 it has awesome details. Characters are well designed and give you the exact face expressions depending on the situation.
Art: The openings and the ending of the series are awesome as they have great music and awesome design. As every anime openings of course they are kinda spoily as they show things from the series that have not happened yet. The anime has awesome soundtracks in general where they fit perfectly on the situation.
Plot: We are in a world where in contrary with ours the people can apply Alchemy! Alchemy is the science where you can take matter , Understand it , dissolve it and then put it back together in something different. All people there can do it pretty much , at least people that are practising the art. Out protagonist tried to follow a forbidden alchemy type when their mother passed away. Wanting to bring their mother back they applied what can be said as human alchemy. The process backfired and Edward lost his leg while his little brother lost his whole body. Edward not knowing what to do he sacrificed his arm to tie his brother soul on an iron armor. After they survived Edward had surgery to apply prosthetic parts and his brother remained as an armor. Now Edward applies to work for the military thinking that he has a chance to find a way to discover the Philosophers Stone, a legendary ingredient which will help him and his brother recover their bodies. The questions are so many that they dont know where to start looking. What are the creatures called homunculus that have the name of the seven sins? What is their connection with the Stone and the way to immortality? Will the two brother stay together until the end or will the guilt consume them?
In General: The plot is very well made and i can tell you that it is so complete that it doesn't let you any holes or blanks when the anime ends. It is deeply mysterious and very moving in such ways that it will definitely make you cry! The plot doesn't only move around the protagonists as all characters in the series are interesting and have an awesome story. 
In Depth Details: The whole world in the animation seems to be Germanized as for starters there is a Fuhrer in the anime. The state alchemists are called dogs of the military and in general the story is very militarized. There is this extermination of the Ishval where i can connect it with gypsies due to their lifestyle , cultural similarities and the fact that Germany killed about 1 million Romans(gypsies) during the war and also the war on multiple fronts. There is also an obsession with the occult in the high ranking members. If you have watched the original FullMetal Alchemist you will see that at the end of the series and the movie, it takes place in Germany 1923 on hitler's age  where the German Nazis are looking for power to invade other countries.
According to the writer: Arakawa has stated she didn't use any specific countries or cultures to create Amestris, but rather a combination of several European countries from several different periods between the 17th and 19th centuries and, more specifically, the changes that occurred in the Western Europe during the Industrial Revolution (with a greater inspiration in England). According to her, however, there's no implied relation or comparison to any specific country, time, or government.",10

                Before watching Brotherhood, I've watched the original series few years back. FMA 1 was good and awesome too, but the thing I hated about it is that the ending is not tragic and is not satisfying. So, knowing that there was an another adaptation of the series made me all curious about it.
Since I enjoyed watching Brotherhood, I never realized I finised watching the whole thing in just one week.
""Why?"", you may ask? Well, at the first few episodes, the pacing of the plot was pretty fast, for someone who have watched the original FMA before. But, if you were not aware of the original
                  series, maybe the pacing would be okay for you. It was not as detailed as the first series, but since there are new additions to the plot, new friends and enemies, and fuller character development, especially with Winry [who was just a minor supporting character in the original series] and of course, with the Elric Brothers, you won't bother about the pacing and embrace these awesome changes instead.
The story plot was different from the original FMA; the first 6 episodes were adapted from FMA1, and the next episodes were all different. Since this plot was faithful to the manga, you'll be surprised... and happy, that there are new things to discover in Brotherhood, as I've mentioned above. The addition of the east country of Xing and the northern Briggs, and their corresponding characters, was like a breath of fresh air to the series, as we can see and expect more stories and more types of alchemy and auto-mail. Also, the origins, forms, and the battles against the homunculi were totally different too. The fight scenes were all amazing. Yes, there are bloodbaths here and there, but that's the part I love the most while watching them fight, whether by weapons, alchemy, or simply a fist-to-fist battle.
Maybe the part I love the most in watching FMA is on the last few episodes. The ending was simply touching, since  Edward still sacrificed something for his younger brother, but in Brotherhood, he sacrificed something different... and less tragic. I also loved the part where Ed, Al, and Hohenheim worked together when they fought with Father, and I simply cried when Hohenheim said to Trisha's grave that he's happy that at last, Edward called him ""Dad"". The ending of FMA 1 was disturbing and not really satisfying, whereas in the ending of Brotherhood, you will love it so much you will wish for a sequel... or an afterstory perhaps.
The art and animation in Brotherhood was clearer, more crisp, and lot more contemporary than the original, as expected from a recently-produced series. I'm not really that particular about how the anime was drawn or animated, but Brotherhood was one of the exemptions to it. The battles were not crappy, and I really got creeped out when the ""immortal army"" was released [the white doll-like humans] from the Central underground.
The seiyuus have done a good job in portraying their roles in Brotherhood, especially Ed and Al's. I also love the OPs and EDs used in Brotherhood, especially ""Hologram"", which was the second OP and surprisingly the last ED of the series. The background music used were perfectly synched with the scenes in a particular episode. After watching the series, you will definitely want to listen to the whole OST.
All of the kinds of characters in Brotherhood-- from the heroes, supporting characters, new characters, and to the villains-- it wasn't possible NOT to love at least one of these kinds. I even loved the character of Greed, who was a bad-turned-good character, and in the end, found satisfaction from his comrades. Also, the guys from Xing were also amazing, especially May, which inspired Al to study eastern alchemy in the latter parts of the story. Also, the addition of Alex Armstrong's older sister was also awesome, and also one of my favorite new characters.
And most especially, I love how Winry was turned into a REALLY important character in the series, and how Ed masked his OBVIOUS liking to her.
I loved the series. I laughed with it. I cried like a baby, especially whenever Ed shows his selfless nii-san love for Al. I was intrigued with every ending of the episode, which was one of the reasons I finished the whole thing in a week. The series was not a disappointment in my part, and it made me wish that all of the other remakes would be AS GOOD as this. This is a quick recommend to my friends who love to watch shounen and for those who were familiar with the original FMA, because Brotherhood was told in the manga's point of view, and the story came in full circle in the end.
Right now, I am suffering from a post-anime series depression, which I think will last a few weeks or more. It's not because the series was bad, rather, Brotherhood was too good for me to finish quickly. All my friends who've watched Brotherhood had the same feeling: the feeling of not watching any anime series for a few weeks before moving on, since when you finished watching Brotherhood, it would feel that a part of you ended with it. After watching the series, I was stunned for a few minutes, and told myself ""This is it; I finished FMA Brotherhood. What will happen next?""
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a good addition to the anime series you should watch before you die [LOL, but seriously]. If you like more action, NO filler episodes, and a satisfying ending, this one's for you.",10
"
                Full Metal Alchemist is the work of mangaka Arakawa Hiromu, and is undoubtedly her most famous work. While an anime series under the name of Full Metal Alchemist did air in 2003-2004, the actual manga itself had not finished at that point and, as a result, the ending differs significantly from the actual manga’s ending. Airing in 2009-2010, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood (henceforth referred to just as FMA) rectified this. Finally viewers were able to experience the joy of the entire Full Metal Alchemist story adapted to anime format – and what a joy it is.
FMA is very quick in establishing an action-packed storyline, soon
                  evolving from the small-scale tale of two boys trying to find a way to recover their bodies into an epic quest to save the people of the nation of Amestris from being literally devoured, as a family of homunculi seek to gain the power of God (perhaps the Japanese ‘Kami’ is more appropriate here, as this God is more of a divine lifeforce than a fully-fledged supreme being). One of the coolest parts about FMA’s storyline, and this came as quite a surprise to me, was how dramatically the pacing slows down in the last quarter. These last 16 episodes represent only about 2 days’ worth of the story, and from this point on everything really is switched up to 11. The action definitely is amped up from this point on, but so too are the personal stories of our characters. It’s hugely rewarding to follow all the mini-storylines as they comes together for the story’s suitably epic conclusion. Without going into any spoilers, the ending to FMA was as close to perfection as I think anime will ever get.
FMA succeeds on multiple levels, being an accomplished mixture of the more enjoyable and light-hearted fights and comedy that a good shounen needs, with a very mature and intelligent approach to the personalities of the characters. It straddles the line between a more adult philosophical anime and a shounen anime placing action first and foremost, dedicating equal time to both these approaches. This is possible largely thanks to the concept of alchemy – the superhuman powers alchemy grants its user is almost absolute. The theme of humans playing god is heavily prevalent in the show, as is the concept of religion in general (Never is the maxim ‘advanced science is indistinguishable from miracles’ more applicable than in the case of alchemy in FMA). It’s a very compelling topic of discussion, and one happily that FMA doesn’t fail to address. The first mini-story of the show, set in the religious town of Leto, is designed to introduce you to our main characters, is focused exactly on this idea, with a healthy dose of action and drama for good measure.
Without further ado though, let’s look at the characters of FMA and why it is this aspect of FMA that is truly what sets the show apart. These characters are what drive the show’s considerable runtime to be a constantly entertaining and, thankfully, filler free experience. I counted about 30 characters who received decent development in the story, an astonishing figure when you consider that’s a character being fully developed every 2 episodes!
It probably won’t come as a shock to you, but it soon becomes apparent when watching FMA that the characters were its biggest strength. This is not only due to the fact that none of them stick to the archetypes loved by many (myself included), but because of how many of the leading characters are both physically and emotionally scarred. Our main characters, Edward and Alphonse, strive to save the world, but not because it is a simple driving principle that they live by, but because they need a solution to atone for their sins. This is not an uncommon driving force in FMA: the Ishbalan war soldiers, Lieutenant Hawkeye, Major Armstrong and Colonel Mustang, are also examples of characters living with regret, as is Scar, an Ishabalan hunted by the country and determined to exact revenge on the soliders of Amestris for killing his entire race! These characters are spending the bulk of their lives having to deal with the consequences for their actions. 
This is why the primary villains of the series, the homunculi, are so much more important than just punching bags. Each homunculus is named after one of the seven deadly sins, and overcoming and defeating the sins that our cast bears is brilliantly exemplified by the action-packed battles with the antagonists. These details add fantastic depth to what could easily have been a very plain ‘stopping bad-guys trying to take over the world’ situation. In a normal shounen anime, I would normally say overcoming enemy after enemy is not the same as character development, but in the case of FMA, it very much is. 
Fullmetal Alchemist makes full (hehe) use of the wonderful opportunities the writer has set up to allow the characters to flourish as humans, not just ideals with bodies or walking plot devices. As a result, the tragedies that befall these characters are not only obstacles for them to overcome. No, they are genuine disasters that scar these characters in longer-lasting and character defining ways. It is the way that the characters are shaped by the actions that surround them that gives them such relatable and loveable traits. 
I won’t spend too long on the animation and music section of FMA, because this review is getting long enough as it is! The sound and music of FMA is something I regularly look back on fondly, because there’s not a moment where it slips up. Voice acting is perfectly cast, and Edward’s squeal when someone calls him short never gets old. The theme songs for FMA are also consistently on point, starting strong with Yui’s fantastic ‘Again’ and never looking back, especially impressive due to the fact that FMA switches up its OP and ED a total of 5 times in its 65 episode running time. 
By contrast, if there’s one thing that Full Metal Alchemist doesn’t excel in, it’s the animation. It does the job and is pleasing to look at, but isn’t anything that you would write home about: character movements are smooth and some of the alchemical constructions are pretty impressive, but that’s pretty much that. 
To wrap-up, FMA is that rare breed of shounen anime where the difficulties the characters face are solved by brains sometimes just as much as they are by brawn, but FMA doesn’t stop there. The characters are all likeable, well-rounded and intensely well-written people. Such is the complete quality of Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood that, over the course of writing this review, my analysis of the characters and their situations has led me to respect them even more than I did having just finished the series for a second time.",10
"
                So in honor of FMA Day 2014 (I know I'm a bit late), I've decided to write a review for my #1 all-time favorite anime (and manga), Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
Honestly, I don't know what I could say about this show that hasn't already been said, but I'll give it a shot anyway.
I'm not going to do what I typically do for a review which is listing the categories and what score I gave them; just know that everything is 10/10. 
I'm also going to address some critique that I've seen of the show and why I agree/disagree with it.
Also I'm avoiding talking about the 03
                  anime because as far as I'm concerned it doesn't exist.
I apologize in advance for this wall of text.
The story of this show is absolutely phenomenal. Not only does it manage to tell the story of the main two characters, Ed and Al, it also gives ample time to all the other characters to show where they come from and how they think. And the show does this all without losing steam or taking long breaks from the action, and also without having characters monologuing in the middle of fights. There's also plenty of comedy, but it never once ruins the mood of the show (cough cough Pandora Hearts).
People like to bash on the rushed beginning of the show, but the reason for the rushed beginning is called Fullmetal Alchemist 2003. Brotherhood quickly sped through the episodes that the 2003 anime had already covered because the good stuff was yet to come. If the pacing at the beginning isn't appealing to you, I'd suggest also watching the corresponding episodes of the original anime. That pacing is more true to the manga's. Plus, after the first 13 or so episodes of Brotherhood, the pacing slows down but, once again, without losing steam. Once the show hits episode 15, new characters that weren't in the 2003 adaptation appear and immediately take part in the story. But the new characters don't stop there. They keep appearing for a long while after that.
Everything in the story is so flawlessly executed that even this type of anime isn't your thing, you can't help but admire how perfectly everything fits together and how many pains the author took in planning every step of the story. Then when you go back and watch the show again, you realize all the subtle foreshadowing that was carefully placed and not obvious enough that you pick up on it before it happens.
This show is technically classified as a shounen anime, though I tend to cringe at that because FMAB isn't really a shounen. If you compare it to a more typical shounen such as Soul Eater, you begin to realize just how different it is. In Brotherhood, there's no yelling out the names of attacks, no long breaks in fights to monologue about plans, and the alchemy used isn't seen as an unquestionable staple of the world. Alchemy itself constantly called into question and many times the characters are forced to ask themselves if it's morally right to use alchemy to change the course of the world (whereas in Soul Eater they don't really debate the morality of the souls they collect). 
Overall, even people that don't like anime like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I've gotten several of my friends (as well as my dad) into anime using this show as a beginning step. If you watch the dub and ignore the obvious fact that it's animated, it doesn't seem like what people typically perceive as an anime at all. It's on a whole other level from everything else I've seen.
In addition, Brotherhood sticks to the manga nearly perfectly (the only things cut out were some minor character development and comedy scenes). Considering Studio Bones has a tendency to deviate from the source material (see: Ouran, Soul Eater, Noragami, FMA 03, etc.), with this show they did an admirable job with delivering an adaptation so accurate that you can read/watch one and not have to watch/read the other, even though I'd recommend doing both because of the anime's gorgeous art and music and the manga's few forgotten moments and the slightly different chapter divides.
Because Brotherhood was put into production when the manga was wrapping up, the show avoids filler episodes (possible exceptions include episodes 1 and 27, in which 1 simply introduces the characters and some foreshadowing and 27 is basically a recap episode that also provides some hints at foreshadowing). If you miss an episode of the show, chances are you'll be very confused as to what is happening. Each episode smoothly leads into the next and they're pretty much unskippable. If it's your first or even second time watching the show, I wouldn't recommend skipping even the fillers because of the foreshadowing they provide. I've seen firsthand how confused the ""fillers"" can make people while I laugh and say that it'll be explained later. And it will. Everything gets explained so clearly, yet all the subtle ways in which the plot points connect amazes me every time I watch the show.
As far as worldbuilding, I give triple thumbs-up to Hiromu Arakawa. She created multiple countries and while we don't get to see too much of life back home (I still want a Xing spinoff), the ideology of the foreigners and how it conflicts with the Amestrian characters' clearly shows. On top of that, Arakawa designed a government system which plays a crucial role in the story (then again, everything plays a crucial role in the story), as well as all of the laws and finer points of how the country is run. I've seen several other animes in which the government is used a plot point, but none of them use government quite as effectively as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood does. So many side stories and spinoffs could potentially grow out of the complex world Arakawa created.
Sorry for writing so much about the story, but there's a lot to write about.
The art and animation are amazing. Not as sharp as Attack on Titan, maybe, but it definitely fulfills all expectations. The battle animation is fluid and well executed, there's subtle use of CGI at certain points, the alchemy lightning is pleasing to watch, and the backgrounds are nicely detailed and do well to set the mood. Some people have said that it's simpler than the 03 anime's style, but I honestly can't see it. If anything, I find it more detailed. There's a few moments in which the same shot is used for more than a few seconds, as well as moments where the characters don't move around very much, but this is a minor detail and excusable considering the top-notch fight animation. There are no dips in quality throughout the show, and everything is handled as one would expect a high-budget anime to be handled.
One of the things I especially love about the art in FMAB is the subtle aging of the characters. They age gradually, like real people, and you don't even notice the process happening until you look back on their appearances at the beginning and realize how much they've changed.
In addition, the women of FMAB are completely unsexualized as well as totally kickass. After watching other animes with copious amounts of fanservice, only now can I appreciate this anomaly and not take it for granted
I really loved the music in this show. While I felt that some tracks were overplayed in the beginning, this becomes less of a problem toward the end of the show because tunes you haven't heard before are suddenly revealed. The opening and ending songs are also very pretty and catchy (though I'm not too big a fan of the third ED), with my personal favorite opening being the last one. However, the first and fourth openings are awesome as well, and I think the first one in particular captures the mood of the show. I also loved the synchronization of some of the sequences to the songs, which I think is a very nice touch.
As far as voice acting, I've seen this anime both dubbed and subbed, and while I like the dub more, both versions are really good. The actors are spot-on as their characters, and I love how they managed to get most of the voice actors from the 2003 anime back for Brotherhood. Even Alphonse's '03 dub actor, Aaron Dismuke, came back, though not as Al because he was too old at that point; instead he voices a minor but important character. Overall, the voice acting in both English and Japanese was really good, and it's safe to go with whichever one you're more comfortable with (though personally I'd say go with the dub because that way you can concentrate on the pretty art and animation).
The characters are simply outstanding. Not only do they all get their backstories thoroughly explored, they all develop and change throughout the show. I've seen a lot of people griping about the fact that the show pretty much completely changes themes from the beginning, but the theme change is BECAUSE the characters changed. Wow, characters can change? Like real people?! I had no idea!
Whenever I'm getting people into this show, I tell them, ""If you see a character that you kind of like, don't worry, because their backstory will be explained."" And they always seem kind of doubtful, but in the end they realize that it's true.
Another reason why I hold this show in the highest regards is that there are many different races, cultures, and religions being portrayed; and while some characters make racist comments, the cultures themselves are treated with the highest respect. The episode detailing the events in Ishval is one of the most grim of the show; the Ishvalans being handled by the story as carefully as if they were a real race.
The romance in this show develops subtly and beautifully and never once hijacks the plot. In addition, while it's amusing to watch Ed and Winry struggling with their feelings for each other, Ed does something pretty atypical for a protagonist: He blames himself for making Winry upset, and not because she got mad at him, but because he knows he should have been there for her. It's not all that often you see the male protagonist apologizing for causing the female protagonist grief.
On top of how well-rounded and three-dimensional all of the characters are, they're all very well designed. Each one of them looks and moves differently according to their personality, and a lot of the characters change outfits regularly (which doesn't seem like much, but it's the little things that count, especially considering most animes don't do this and a lot of them have some kind of uniform, school or otherwise, to avoid having to have the characters changing outfits).
All in all, every one of the characters in FMAB leave a lasting impression on the viewer, whether they were in the show for one episode or all of them. It's so hard to pick a favorite.
Even though this show, at 64 episodes, is the longest anime I've seen yet, it's such a fast watch that it honestly doesn't feel like it. While I personally haven't set any records with the speed of my watching, friends of mine have finished the show in time periods from 2-4 days, because of the sheer addictiveness of it. And the show IS addictive. Every few months I get a strong urge to rewatch it and cry all over again. And while I'll never completely forget every detail, every time I rewatch it I'm still blown away. 
This show draws you in with the seriousness of the story, the depth of the characters, the gorgeous art and sound, and pretty much every other detail you can think of. To sum it up, if you want a viewing experience on a whole other level from anything you've seen, if you want an ending that will make you break down and rethink your life, if you've seen the original FMA and enjoyed it, watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. It's not the #1 rated anime on MAL by accident, and it'll definitely always be my #1.",10

                	One thing I distinctly remember about the 12 year old me was a fear of becoming a mega nerd who watched anime. I enjoyed video games but didn’t want to plunge headlong into the void I saw before me. Well, times changed and I found myself watching my first anime at a college friend’s behest. In 2011 I found myself entranced with the deep and exciting world of Fullmetal Alchemist and the story of the two Elric brothers as they journeyed to redeem themselves. The ending to that first series, however, was a letdown that shook my good impressions of the strong opening. That opinion
                  remains to this day.
	A few months later I recounted my experiences to my friend and, to my surprise, he replied that a retelling of the series had recently finished which remained faithful to the source material. After a few months, I sat down on Netflix and watched Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The whole time I wondered: can the series be better than the original? Could the already great relationship I encountered between the two brothers be deepened? 
Story:	
First, I’d like to explain the story. Two brothers, Edward and his younger brother Alphonse Elric, live in the mysterious land of Amestris where Alchemy is a science practiced by those gifted with this strange ability. The Elric brothers grow up in their hometown with their childhood friend Winry and their mother until a plague comes through the area. Tragically, their mother passes away in the epidemic but Edward and Alphonse resolve to see their mother’s smile once more. They study from books their absent father left behind and attempt to do the forbidden: bring the dead to life. Needless to say the attempt turns horribly wrong and the series then focuses on the siblings trying to return themselves back to normal. 
What separates Brotherhood from its original 2003 counterpart is not really apparent at first. The brothers commit the same horrible act and what immediately follows is eerily similar. When the story reaches Dublith, however, Brotherhood begins to tell a new story. The result, I am delighted to say, is an exciting epic that twists and turns throughout the whole of the mythical world Hiromu Arakawa has laid out for us. The purpose for which the two brothers fight becomes deeper and deeper without ever losing sight of what originally drove the two to join the fight in the first place; and the resolve of the Elric brothers is pushed to the limit in ways you would never think possible. The ending is especially epic as the underlying philosophy of the show comes to light. It’s amazing to see a show that does this well in the end and Brotherhood deserves every ounce of praise it gets for its story
Sadly, it would be a lie to claim this story is perfectly told. Both the very beginning and middle section of the series suffer from pacing issues. To be frank, the beginning is often criticized for the choice to gloss over material covered in the 2003 counterpart.  While all the material is there, you might be wishing for just a little more explanation before the show continues at full speed. The middle section of the anime also suffers from a pacing issue, but this time it’s too slow. While it was nice to take a breather from the action immediately preceding this section, Brotherhood falters as it introduces the final set of characters that will join in the epic climax. 
24/25
Characters:
Probably the most remarkable aspect of the original Fullmetal Alchemist series back in 2003 was the goofy and touching bond between the two brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric. The rapid back and forth between the two served as an ideal backdrop to explore the two brothers’ personalities. Fortunately this bond was not only kept with the new series, but taken to even higher heights. Seeing the two in action was truly a delight. 
One of the exciting things about Brotherhood was a truly diverse cast with characters that fairly consistently avoided the cardboard character models that are so easy to fall into. Minor characters that stand out include Yoki, Maes Hughes, and of course Lust. But what makes the series memorable is the diverse cast of characters with their own motivations. Roy Mustang and Riza Hawkeye are trying to atone for the crimes of the Ishvallan war of extermination and build a better world no matter what the cost. General Armstrong seeks to make Amestris as strong as it can possibly be and fights to make it so. And even the enemies have motivations that sum up to more than a simple “we must stop the main protagonists at all costs.” Brotherhood massively succeeds in making the story engaging through its exciting cast, and I feel as if the story is as wonderful as it is because of the well-developed characters in this series.       
24/25
Animation:
Of course no animated series can exist without the medium of animation to carry facial expressions and convey action. To this respect, Brotherhood improves upon the solid foundations left by the 2003 series and the manga.  I particularly enjoy the character designs, but animation experts have raved about the fantastic fight scenes the series boasts. One animator, Yoshimichi Kameda, has received extensive praise for his touches and innovations in the Sakuga of several major fight scenes. Aside from that there are a few instances where the animation gets a little derpy and the chibi animation can sometimes interfere with the overall gravity of the plot; but I find it refreshing that a series so epic takes a small breather every now and then.
16/17.5
Sound:
With regards to the overall sound of the show, I felt as if there was some solid work put in on the part of Akira Senju. Unfortunately, the music of the series does begin to grind on you as the show reaches the climatic final scenes. This is alleviated somewhat by the execution of the music in the show as it never overpowers the quietest moments and never is lost even in the thick of combat. One major plus in my book is the work done by Funimation in their Dub of the show. Vic Mignogna delivers again in his reprise of Edward Elric and the rest of the English cast is, for the most part, quite solid. As I am not a native speaker of Japanese I generally prefer watching the Dub when I can so I am able to more effectively judge the quality of the voice acting; and the English cast is phenomenal. If I had to comment on the original voice acting performed in Japanese I would remark that the Voice actor for Edward sounds much younger than an American 15 year old would sound… Haters gonna hate.		
14/17.5
Accessibility:
Finally, I would be negligent to recommend or condemn this series without mentioning the appropriateness of the series to all ages. While I do feel as if the series is a masterfully told story, there are elements that prohibit me from recommending this adventure to all. Most notably the dark one and violence make this series a no go for anyone under the age of 15. If you doubt me watch episode 4 and tell me it isn’t dark. Also it seems like every shonen series has an uncontrollable urge to throw in a tub scene with the main love interest. Obviously this isn’t family friendly. While complete nudity is not an issue, this series is not guitless when it comes to the regrettable trend of fanservice and innuendo. 	
4/5
Enjoyment factor:
I loved Brotherhood… Enough said, and seeing as it tells a complete story that examines and plays out different philosophies as part of its intricate design, it seems as if Brotherhood will continue to be my most enjoyable TV experience for a long time.
10/10
Many people have lauded Brotherhood since its completion and I am happy to include myself in their number. The sheer glory of the ending is a masterpiece that needs to be seen to believe, though the barrier of entry regrettably limits the audience of the series. For these reasons I rate Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood with a score of 92 out of 100 and grade the series as a Diamond rated show. Brotherhood is a monument to anime done well, and is a testament to a story told superbly. The combination of quality animation and well developed characters provide the perfect backdrop to a tale of two brothers. A tale where redemption is just beyond their reach.",10

                When the original Fullmetal Alchemist came out in 2003, it was apparent that it followed the manga at first, but them went on it's path. Which didn't make it bad, but it annoyed many people, including me (Even though I didn't watch it until about 9 or 10 years after it came out.) 
But! Our fandom had been blessed with a reboot of the series that follows the manga, and is pretty damn good. I have been intimidated to write about this series because well, it's too awesome to tackle with reviews. 
But here we go! 
Story 9/10 
This story is unique! I've never seen,
                  or read, a story such as this one. What I think I liked most about it, was the fact that it HAD so many episodes. A story like this one can't be just put out there and finish up in 26 episodes or less. They did an amazing job wrapping everything up at the end of 64 episodes. 
What especially loved was the fact that the story flowed so nicely, even though when I first watched it I was confused during the first 13 episodes because I had watched FMA '03 before hand. You should probably wait a little bit before diving into this series after finished the original. It may seem the same, but it's a whole different ball park. However, no questions are left unanswered, and there are a lot of feels involved. 
Art: 9/10 
I am personally a fan of BONES, they do great animation work with a unique style of their own. It works nicely for this show, it has it's dark moments and the animation fits with that. 
There's also the standard; 'Anime serious face' and the 'anime goofing off face'. EX: Ouran High school host club. I think BONES did really well, with character detail. But not so much with background animation, things seemed a bit off there. You'll see what I mean if you watch it. 
Sound 10/10 
Expect 10s from here on out, and I don't usually hand out 10s. 
Ahhhhh this series has the most beautiful sound track, each scene that has music accompaniment has a set of emotion. The sound track can make you laugh and cry, there even have been some scenes really helped with anger or hatred towards a character. 
They re-use songs a lot, but still have a large amount of songs. My favorite is 'Brothers'. You will hear that a few times, it's a sound track that I could listen to all the time if I could. 
Character 10/10 
The story of this series effects the characters in a certain way (I can't say too much on that with out giving spoilers).  And what I really, really, love about these characters is that they react REALISTICALLY. I /adore/ characters who have negative backgrounds and react according to them. 
Even Maes Hughes who acts as a comic relief, is serious when he needs to be. There aren't any annoying characters, and there are a crap ton of strong female characters.  
You will grow to love all these characters, and feel for them! 
Enjoyment 10/10 
This anime, is hilarious, then sad, then action packed. I loved it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. 
Over all: 10/10
This is an anime that will live in my heart for years. I've re-watched it 5 times, and never get tired of it. I HIGHLY recommend you watch this series, you will not regret it. 
Now, about the dub. I'm a person who prefers dub over subbed. But I can watch subbed and I know when I hear a bad dub. This is NOT a bad dub. In fact, it's the best I've seen in all the anime I have seen. I also highly recommend watching this anime dubbed if you like it that way. You will not be disappointed. 
That's all, happy watching ^^",10
"
                This show is a shounen anime. Or, at least, it is supposed to be. It is the topped ranked anime on MAL right now for a reason. You come to care for the Elric brothers, the Rockbells, for the whole cast.
For a show that ultimately is about the bonds we form here on earth, FMA:B does a phenomenal job of portraying these bonds in a fictional world with exceptional character development all around.
One thing is also to be noted. This series never forgets. Never. Ed's inscription holds true, but not just for the 3rd-- those who are lost are never forgotten, not once. This show
                  consistently and and meaningfully calls back to early moments in the show the Elric brothers said they'd never forget, making those moments relevant again as new challenges are faced.
I think it was about six episodes in that I had to stop my first binge run. It was because I was absolutely horrified and disgusted. Normally shows can't shake me. But some of the themes this touches on feel so real the characters that they affect seem so human that you can't help be mortified at the tragedies, just as elation comes when it is due.
That's another big thing. The humor in this show is mild but it balances out the sorrow. It builds the relationships in tandem with the drama to show us something that isn't perfect, but is so clearly superior to Sakura's friendship speeches and although the dialogue at times felt subpar, it never felt completely pointless.
The action scenes, too, were rarely drawn out unnecessarily and were all beautifully crafted. I'm crossing my fingers that more shows will get their brotherhood, because although this series is longer than the original it felt more focused, and certainly it ended up feeling more meaningful. I may have given few hours to this show, but I feel equivalent exchange was not at play here because it has given me a lot more than I was expecting.",10
"
                This is one of the greatest anime of all time.  I know that's kind of bold statement to make but in my opinion it is one of the greats and my personal favorite.  The story is great and is paced so well especially in comparison to FMA 03 the original adaption.  This anime's greatest strength is its story and characters because its characters are just that characters not cardboard cutout archetypes.  For example Winry Rockbell starts the show as this stereotypical childhood friend who is always keeping the main heroes in line but while she continues that she expands with a
                  back story and emotion that shows she cares for her friends and the people around her.  The two main protagonist are Edward and Alphonse Elric who are excellently written as the short-tempered leader who just wants to protect who he loves in Edward and Alphonse as such a  softy who just wants do what's right in his quest for his body.  The story as I said before has excellent pacing moving from gripping drama to bits of humor to intense action seemlessly.  I'm not going to say this is perfect because it isn't some of fights lack speed and weight in the animation.  Speaking of which the animation isn't anything to write home about in my opinion keep in mind I watch this in 2014 so for its time its above average.  The sound overall is quite good the theme was carried from FMA which isn't a problem and the openings are much improved with the first standing out.  Overall its at least worth watching to get your own idea of it",10
"
                Pros: Brilliant plot, excellent opening/endings, perfect flawed characters 
Cons: Rushed Beginning, art style is a little cartoon-y 
 Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is undoubtedly one of the most popular animes out there, and for a good reason. It follows two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric who attempted to bring their mother back to life with the most forbidden alchemy: Human Transmutation.  Their attempt failed, costing Alphonse his entire body, and Edward his left leg. In a desperate attempt to keep his brother with him, Edward willingly sacrificed his right arm in exchange for Alphonse's soul. Edward bound Al's soul to a suit of armor he
                  found in his basement.
 This plot is perfectly explained in the original anime ""Fullmetal Alchemist"". It's like they created this with the thought that everyone watched the original first. I would highly recommend watching the first one if you want more insight on the transmutation, or reading the manga version. 
 I also criticized the art style to be a little cartoony for my taste, but gave it a  8. The style itself is clean and fresh but feels very simplistic. However, overtime when you watch this anime- one of my favorite parts is that the characters do not stay the same age. The characters grow in the story as you watch, and you don't realize it until you see the teenage protagonist actually looks like a young adult in comparison to the 12 year old you once got introduced to. 
 The soundtrack is wonderful, it's a great listen. The openings also make the characters grow/change like in the anime. When you see them separately, and look at them side-by-side, you'll see the growth. One of the most uniquest things I have ever seen in an Anime. 
 The characters in FMAB, are all lovely. They each have there own story/quest. In the end, you really enjoy watching them grow with the protagonists and see them help Edward and Alphonse reach there goal including there own. 
 Overall, this anime is wonderful and heartbreaking, and will make you laugh and cry. Even though this anime has flaws, I gave a 10 because of the wonderful journey it gave me. Its truly a treat.  It's a beautiful story you will honestly never forget.",10
"
                Yes, I may praise this anime to the skies but I think that a lot of people would agree with me.
I, like many others have watched Fullmetal Alchemist from 2003 and while that also was a very good anime I felt like it kind of went off track at the end, that is probably why I was overjoyed when Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was announced.
I really feel like Brotherhood patched up all that went wrong with FMA-2003 and at the end it felt like the story was completed.
The characters and the story in this anime is outstanding, there are so many different characters and all of
                  them have their own personalities. It's very interesting to follow them and see how they evolve through the serie.
For me it's very important that it does not only have strong male characters but also very strong female characters. I personally love animes (and mangas) that have very strong females and that doesn't go for the more typical type of female that we often see in animes and mangas. 
This anime is truly epic and if you haven't watched it you should seriously reconsider. But be warned that you will probably become very emotional during the time you watch it.",10
"
                Best show I've ever seen.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is probably the best series I've ever seen. There are several reasons for this: 
1) The story is truly compelling! It really grows on you, since the viewer wants the Elric brothers to reach their goal of getting their bodies back, because of their hard childhood, where their dad left home and their mother died. You grow a sympathy towards these two boys. The plot is amazing, though I don't want to spoil anything. The idea of Alchemy is great in my opinion. So I'll give the story: 10/10
2) The art is top notch, the fighting scenes are
                  amazing and the backgrounds are beautiful. The characters are well-made and they actually seem really human, though they are animated. (Wrath's fighting scenes are awesome!) - Art: 9/10 (almost 10/10l)
3) The sounds in FMA Brotherhood is good, but still the show's weakest aspect. Sometimes the background music doesn't really fit, but it doesn't bring down the show. The opening and closing songs are really good, the second opening is one of my favourite Japanese songs. The genereal sounds and talking are good as well. - Sounds deserve a 9/10 (Close to 8/10, due to the background music being out of place at times). 
4) What really made me love FMA: Brotherhood is the characters in the show. They are truly geniously put together. I am a twin brother myself, so I was really touched by Edward's and Alphonse's brotherhood, since I feel that I would go through the same shit as they do, only to help my brother. 
Roy Mustang is a great character, who has quite some shadows of his yesterdays hanging on his shoulders. He has killed many men during some civil wars, which happened in the country. 
Scar is also an important character, who was filled with hatred and seeks revenge on the State Alchemists, who destroyed the Ishbalans, who was Scar's people. 
Louis Armstrong is a fun character, who brings a nice humourous aspect to the show with his Gai Sensei-like emotional and masculine behaviour. 
There are tons of other great characters, I could go on forever, but these were the highlights to me. 
5) All the reasons mentioned above made me enjoy this show more than I've enjoyed any other show. The plot is amazingly well-written and the characters are really believable and sometimes this show just bring the chills, since you really symphatize with the characters. The ending is just perfect, so I'll give FMA: Brotherhood the biggest 10/10 I've ever given to any show.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was the first anime I ever watched, and probably one of the best. The story is pretty simple, it's on MAL so I'm not explaining it. However, I will say this, this anime is sad. You wouldn't expect it from seeing the title or a picture. But this anime is as sad as Clannad: After Story or any other anime that tries to be emotional. I recently rewatched this anime, and I experienced the train ride I had. This anime has so many unexpected moments, especially towards the end. SPOILERS AHEAD: I think that Hughes should have had a bit more screen
                  time, don't get me wrong I want to say that I cried. But the thing that made me sad were the reactions of the other characters with hughes dying. They made the aftermath perfect, but before that,9/10. A bit more and it would be perfect. You learn a lot of things in this anime, They apply to real world situations. Let's face it, when we wish for something big, we always sacrifice something. Like ""I wish for Hoenn to be remade"" Your wish comes true but you lose hope halfway. The characters were very enjoyable, the villains were great as well, Animation and Sound, perfect. Overall, my rating would be 9.9/10 which I would say is near perfect. This anime is incredible, and everyone should watch it. I may be a bit too much of a fanboy, but trust me, you'll love it.",10
"
                *Spoiler Alert*
To me... Brotherhood is a huge disappointment.
After seeing the original series and reading all the manga that has been released, I was looking forward to a series that was closer to the manga.
That's not what I got.
What I got was very pretty and very fast moving anime with no emotional or personal relationships between the characters, other then that of Ed and Al.
There are parts in original series where i admit i cried, hard.
Like the death of Hughes. 
I was surprised when his death in this series, didn't bring up a tear and wasn't more then side note. And in this series other then
                  the apple pie made by Gracia, Edward had no personal or emotional relationship to Hughes.
How can he be devastated by his death, when all he did was meet him a couple times? He barely knew the guy.
And where is Roy?
Its 12 eps into the series and i've seen what.. 2 eps with Roy in them. He was pretty important in the first series and in the manga. 
What's happening with Scar and what's going on back in Central?
This series is leaving a lot of blanks and questions. 
And far as being more connected to manga, not really. Where are Ranfan, Olivier Milla Armstrong and Ling? 
By this point they should have at least made some kind of appearance. 
And I'm sure for all the first time watchers of FMA this a great series, but if you go read the manga and loved the original series like I did... your just flabbergasted by how horrible this series right now, because you had more faith that it would be awesome.",6
"
                Brotherhood boasts that it follows the mangas story more closely than the previous anime adaptation, and it does.  However the actual quality of the anime itself is far poorer.  What realy made FMA's previous anime adaptation so successfull was the overall direction of the anime.  The quality of shots used in this anime and the art itself is inferior to the original anime.  Obviously it is still highly enjoyable due to the story behind it, but the anime seems overhyped.  People feel pressured to believe thats its better due to the story being more accuratly followed.  This is not
                  the way to think.  The anime suffered hugely at first as well, as it attempted to catch up to the manga, thus rushing through over half of the story.  The sound was not bad, but then again it was not that good.
FMA fanatics should enjoy this as it follows the manga more closely, however if you have not read the manga then I would reccomend the original series, as in all honesty it is of much better quality.",5
"
                It is rushed. Completely and utterly rushed.
I fully enjoyed the original FMA since episode 1. It was well thought out. However, Brotherhood is the completely opposite. Since the storyline completely rushed, it does not allow for explanation. The characters are introduced so quickly, making Brotherhood just like any other anime out there.
I was really looking forward to watching this new version (despite wishing for a continuation of the original series) since it followed the manga more accurately.
Brotherhood is a disappointment for me, but I will continue to watch it since I love the original FMA so much.

Everyone in this anime has their own story and the way each of their stories is told neatly ties them all together and creates a relationship, not just between you and the character but between the characters themselves, giving you the whole story in a way unique to Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. The great way the story is told combined with the amazing plot and fantastic ending (yes this anime has an actual ending, not just that but its the one everyone was hoping for!) I give the story aswell as the anime a 10!

                This is hands down the anime which is for sure in my top five anime. this anime had all of the things fully packed in it. First the story, it is amazingly written with none to zero plot hole. The story is in my opinion a masterpiece and can be said as a complete series. This anime doesn't strechs out to another season and give us a full compelet story in one series. It doesn't matter if you have seen the first installment of the series ( full metal alchemist) because this anime shows all the information to us, viewer, in full complete story. The
                  character in this anime is well blanced. Even though it has two main characters in it, The characters gets enough development to get viewer feel about them as the story progresses.
In the end, I would say the whole anime series of full metal alchemist brotherhood is a straight up masterpiece and every person in the anime community should give it a try. It deserves to be number one in the mal top anime list.",10

                If there's one programme out there which a tad frustrating for me, it's Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I don't know about you, but I'm absolutely sick of seeing reviews giving this show a 10/10. Don't get me wrong though, I absolutely adore Fullmetal Alchemist as a whole and I do believe that the adventures of Edward and Alphonse should be viewed by all at some point. But it's really the fans' reaction to this show that drive me up a wall. At its core, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a great show that does a lot of things right (and I do mean a LOT of shit
                  right) but ends up getting some shit wrong along the way as well.
Of course, it's important to understand why this show was made before I get started with the actual review itself. Before Brotherhood ever existed, there was the first Fullmetal Alchemist TV series: a loose adaptation of the manga which eventually broke away from the source material in order to tell its own story. Now, this was important for two reasons. The first is because at the time of the first series' creation, there weren't that many chapters there to adapt so either Bones had to wing it or Arakawa had to sacrifice her creative integrity and succumb to both publisher deadlines AND studio pressure as well.
The second reason is the most important: because the first series branched off and became its own entity, that gave Hiromu Arakawa much more time to flesh out the manga's universe and go in the direction she so chooses without having to worry about things like deadlines as much. Talk shit all you want about the first TV series, but just keep in mind that without the first TV series, the manga as we know it right now would be vastly different and Brotherhood would in all likelihood not exist. Of course, the fact that the circumstances behind this show's creation rely so heavily on what went down in the first show does come back to bite Brotherhood in the ass. How so?
Well for one thing, the first 15 episodes of Brotherhood are rather... ""rushed,"" I guess? Now, this was actually a stylistic choice on the part of Bones since the logic at the time of creation was that the vast majority of people who are watching this show would have already watched the 2003 series first so they didn't want to bore returning viewers by showing them the same stuff they saw before. While that certainly is a respectable goal, there's only one little problem with that logic: this is supposed to be a REBOOT of the anime series. If you're going to reboot something, any prior entries in the franchise shouldn't even be factored into the equation.
Now granted, I did complete Brotherhood first before going on to complete the 2003 series and nothing really seemed out-of-place, but upon re-watching after completing the 2003 series... it just didn't really feel the same. For instance, there's the whole ordeal with Nina Tucker. If you've spent ANY amount of time around the FMA fandom, you should have *some* idea that what happens to this 4-year-old girl is NOT pretty. In the 2003 series however, the Tucker family's role was expanded and we got to see more of Nina before ""it"" happened (and let me just say that the entire thing was fucking depressing after ""it"" happened).
In Brotherhood... Nina is just around for one episode and after tragedy befalls her, she's apparently one of the driving forces behind Edward and Alphonse's goals of becoming better alchemists. Let me get this straight: a little girl that you didn't even know for more than a week is going to be one of the driving forces behind our lead protagonists' goals for the entire series' run? Yeah... I'm not buying it. Yes, what happened to her is sad but I find it incredibly hard to believe that an incident like that to someone that Ed and Al barely knew would have THAT much of an impact on them. There are WAY more examples like that than I let on, by the way. I just don't feel like covering them all since that's far too much work on my end.
Another aspect about Brotherhood I take umbrage with is the comedy. To put it short, I don't really care much for Hiromu Arakawa's chibi-style humour since it just takes me out of the seriousness of the moment and just kills the mood altogether in a vein similar to Kuroshitsuji. Of course, that's not really a fair comparison since Bones is a far more competent studio than A-1 Pictures but it's still something to be mentioned. You can only imagine my frustration whenever I saw Ed go into chibi mode right after some intense action or a relatively serious moment goes down. I mean, yeah it gets a quiet chuckle out of me but do you really have to resort to THAT style of humour to elicit a laugh or two out of the viewers? Come on...
The last thing that I don't really have a lot of praise for is the fact that despite the fact that it's definitely a cut above its competition in the battle shonen genre, it still FEELS like a battle shonen series in all the wrong ways from time to time. Don't get me wrong, Hiromu Arakawa really put in a lot of thought and effort into writing up the story and the characters but you can just tell where she got lazy and resorted to using some of the same clichés that plague other battle shonen anime/manga series. They're few and far between, but when they pop up, chances are that you'll instinctively face-palm (especially if there's some bullshit monologue about friendship; I'm looking at you, final fight between Envy and Roy Mustang >_>).
Now with all that ugliness out of the way, let's talk positives because hot DAMN is there a lot of praise to give this show. When it comes down to world-building, Hiromu Arakawa is all but unmatched. The world that Brotherhood is set in is masterfully crafted, with a lot of detail put into the locations that each part of the story takes place in. It's quite evident that the biggest reason why the manga took so long to complete would be that Hiromu Arakawa spent a great deal of time fleshing out the finer details of the locations that she brings up. In fact, the only works that I can think of that would be on equal or better footing than Brotherhood would be the likes of Harry Potter, Hunter x Hunter, One Piece, and Legend of the Galactic Heroes.
Another thing that Brotherhood has going for it is the adventure. I don't know about you, but I always found myself enamoured with the new locations and such that Ed and Al would come across on their journeys. From Lior to Fort Briggs and even the ruins of Xerxes, I never cease to find myself captivated by what's going on. What's more is that the adventure from start to finish (with the exception of the first 15 episodes) is incredibly well-paced. No segment of the adventure feels drawn out to the point of being tedious or rushed to the point where nothing of substance actually happens and that segment could've easily been cut out. Each part of the narrative feels necessary to the plot and is given just enough time to make its impact before we move on to the next part of the story.
Speaking of which, one of the biggest complaints I see people lodging against the 2003 series is its supposed lack of action. Well Brotherhood makes up for that supposed weakness in full force. At its core, the Fullmetal Alchemist manga is a battle shonen manga and what battle shonen adaptation would be complete without epic fights? All the fights in Brotherhood are perfectly timed, so they're not hideously drawn nor are they dissatisfyingly short. What's more is that battles are only present in episodes where a fight NEEDS to go down for the sake of plot, so there are no pointless fights thrown in for the hell of it so the fights themselves don't detract from the story in the slightest.
Battles, adventures, and a masterfully crafted setting aren't the only thing that Brotherhood has going for it. Surprising though it may be, battle shonen series are actually able to have some damn good drama thrown into the mix which is more than capable of having you emotionally involved with what's going on and that's one of the hallmarks surrounding Fullmetal Alchemist as a whole. Whilst the focus of Brotherhood is more on the adventure than it is the drama, that doesn't stop the show from being able to have more than its fair share of compelling and emotionally involving moments. 
The last thing that I want to talk about story-wise before I move on to the characters is the ending. The biggest reason why the 2003 series is so divisive amongst FMA fans as a whole is how the series itself actually concluded. The 2003 series' original conclusion was nothing short of bitter-sweet, with a MUCH heavier emphasis on the bitter than the sweet, even in the sequel movie Conqueror of Shamballah. Brotherhood's ending is the exact opposite. It is a happy ending in every sense of the word which fans found INFINITELY more satisfying than what was there previously. As the great Nobuhiro Watsuki said, shonen series are ultimately comics meant for boys and they should have happy endings. Why? Well... boys are young. Save the depressing shit for when they're older and develop a nasty drinking problem.
If there's one area where Fullmetal Alchemist will always succeed (regardless of incarnation), it would definitely have to be with the characters. Of course with that said, Brotherhood is a more event-driven programme rather than character-driven so character development isn't really a priority. For example, Ed and Al more or less remain the same throughout their entire ordeal. They don't degenerate as individuals, yet they also don't improve or even change in any notable way throughout the entire show's run. Regardless, Ed's characterisation is absolutely spectacular.
What I really love about Ed's characterisation is the fact that despite going through a great deal of strife in his life, he knows how to laugh and have fun. He rebels against authority from time to time, he and Al fight like brothers do, he has childish outbursts from time to time, etc. What I'm getting at is that despite all of the crap he's gone through, he still behaves like a teenager would. In many ways, Ed reminds me of Peter Parker from the Ultmate Spider-Man comics and that resemblance really does boost him up several notches on my likeability meter. His dynamic with Alphonse is also something that I enjoy quite a bit because it feels a bit like Terry McGinnis/Maxine Gibson's relationship from Batman Beyond.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Alphonse. Throughout the course of Fullmetal Alchemist (this applies to the manga and both TV series), Alphonse more or less remains static throughout the entire show's run and doesn't get any characterisation beyond functioning as the Maxine Gibson to Edward's Terry MicGinnis and being the gentle giant/naive younger sibling. Any sort of subplot that seemed like it would add more to his character don't really play out as such so we're basically back to where we started. Take the part where Al doubts his own humanity for instance. You'd think that would be like a REALLY huge thing, but no... it gets resolved within 1-2 episodes and Al is back to re-transmuting Ed's soul once Winry knocks it out of Ed's body with her wrench... oh well, such is life.
The secondary characters in Fullmetal Alchemist have always been of variable quality, and the same remains true in Brotherhood (perhaps even more so because Brotherhood has a MUCH larger supporting cast). Some characters like Roy Mustang, Greed, Scar, Father, and Fuhrer Bradley are REALLY well-written with their own degrees of complexity while others like Lust, Sloth, and Gluttony didn't really have much to their personality aside from being antagonists. I know that this shit is to be expected, but Hiromu Arakawa REALLY outdid herself when it came down to all this other stuff, and when I don't see that level of quality maintained throughout the work, it just leaves me feeling empty inside. 
On the technical side of things, Brotherhood is definitely among the best-looking shows that Bones has ever produced, but this is obviously to be expected. Bones is no slouch when it comes down to visual quality. Hell, even shows that they created more than a decade ago like RahXephon and Wolf's Rain hold up pretty damn well in 2014. If I had to sum up my thoughts on the visuals, I'd have to say that Brotherhood's aesthetics are more or less identical to the 2003 show's, but refined. Character designs are more in-line with the manga's, improvements in animation technology allow for less still frames/talking heads present, and what's more is that there's a good deal more background animation present. Speaking of which, Brotherhood's action is bar none some of the most enthralling that I've ever seen in ANY shonen anime.
Another area where Brotherhood excels are in the OPs/EDs. It's rare for me to find an anime that I enjoy have multiple openings, all of which that I actually do like. Personally, I'm biased toward the 5th OP, as it's the opening that really just sets the stage perfectly for the final few episodes of Brotherhood. It has this atmosphere about it where everyone's weary and yet they're so close to their goal that they can't just give up now and that what I'm about to watch really is the home stretch. ED-wise, I'm biased toward the 1st ED because of the animation style as it's all-chibi artwork animated as if it were drawn in pencil with a great track playing over it. That actually brings me over to the audio side of the spectrum.
Audio-wise, Brotherhood doesn't disappoint... asterisk. Now there is one complaint that I have with the OST but that's mostly because the 2003 show's OST is among my all-time favourite anime OSTs and yet Brotherhood just didn't live up to my expectations upon re-watch. This is a similar problem that I had with Hellsing Ultimate in the sense that its predecessor's OST is superior to my ears than the OST that we have for the reboot despite the fact that the one present is REALLY good stuff. There wasn't much in the way of background music that stood out, although it did serve as a complement to whatever was going on and there wasn't anything that I personally found inappropriate for the moment at hand. My favourite OP/ED themes are ""Rain"" and ""Uso"" by SID respectively, just so I can get that out of the way.
Dub-wise, Funimation steps up to the plate and delivers in full force. The cast is almost identical to the 2003 series' dub (which is one of my all-time favourite Funimation dubs, by the way), save for certain characters because let's face it: there's no way you can get the same people to work on a project they had a hand in 5-6 years ago all in one place. The most noticeable changes to the cast are Maxey Whitehead replacing Aaron Dismuke as Alphonse, Troy Baker replacing Chris Patton as Greed, J. Michael Tatum replacing Dameon Clark as Scar, and John Swasey aka Gendo Ikari replacing Scott McNeil as Hohenheim.
I can safely say that Whitehead, Baker, Tatum, and Swasey all do an excellent job with the roles they were given and are on-par if not better than their predecessors... although I'm biased toward Chris Patton's version of Greed for... reasons. The rest of the dub is spot-on. Vic Mignonga, Travis Willingham, Caitlin Glass, Colleen Clinkenbeard, Laura Bailey, and everyone else who had a hand to play in this dub did an absolutely spectacular job. I'd like to hear dub haters try and talk shit about this dub, because I can't find anything wrong with it.
Final thoughts? Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shining example of what an adaptation SHOULD do, and yet it baffles me as to how people can consider this to be the best anime ever and something that is infinitely superior to the 2003 series. Despite my preference of the 2003 series, I'd say that they're equals. It's not often we get TWO adaptations which have VERY well-written plots and if you really are a manga purist, you can view the 2003 series as an alternate universe interpretation. Regardless, I absolutely enjoyed watching Brotherhood and I look forward to the day where I can own a DVD/Blu-ray combo pack of the entire show. Both the 2003 series and Brotherhood should be watched by all and both deserve a special place on your shelf of interesting items.
With that said, I'm out. Feedback is always welcome, as are monetary contributions and offerings of food, drinks, chromosomes and fancy clothes to the Dark Lord Chin-Chin.",8

                After watching Fullmetal Alchemist, I was left with an unsatisfied feeling. Everything felt rushed, and the twists and turns lacked gravitas. So it was with great scepticism that I continued on to watch Brotherhood. Quickly, my fears about this remake were dispelled and I was hooked. Four days and 64 episodes later, I'm at the end and I'm blown away.
I do strongly suggest you watch FMA before moving onto Brotherhood. FMA was good, had a lot of entertainment value, but half the things I wanted to see didn't happen - and I haven't even read the manga yet. But in Brotherhood you get everything you
                  expected to see and more.
The relationship between Edward and Alphonse feels so much more real in FMA Brotherhood. I can actually see their bond and believe that they'd do anything to get their bodies back. In FMA, I wanted to see more brotherly moments, and I just didn't get that until Brotherhood. 
Winry had a much bigger role to play in Brotherhood than she did in FMA. Her interactions with Ed and Al we hilarious and touching, and the three of them really drive this story all the way. You never stop rooting for them and you never stop hoping that they can right their wrongs and get their bodies back.
Another favourite duo was Mustang and Hawkeye. I loved seeing the two of them together, because they just played off each other really well. They were there for each other through thick and thin and every scene they had together was a delight to watch.
FMA Brotherhood left me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't stop watching, and when I had to because I needed sleep, I swear that all I could think about was FMA Brotherhood, the characters, and where I thought this anime would go. 
I strongly recommend this!",10
"
                I really enjoyed this anime purely for the fact it always had me on the edge of my seat.
The character development through the whole thing was absolutely amazing! seeing Al and Ed go through god only knows what all the while learning from their past experience was just mind blowing and partly one of the reasons why I really love this show. Side characters were even developed and honestly it was beautiful to see all the hard work of everyone in the FMA:B team just all fall into place mainly because of character development and an extremely gripping story line (with added side plots too
                  keep the story going)
The animation at first was not really my cup of *insert drink here* but slowly grew on me as I couldn't imagine the show being drawn in any other way.     
The soundtrack for the show was also one of the reasons I really enjoyed it as I'm normally one to skip intro's and outro's but the songs were just beautiful and fitting to be skipped, even after I'd heard them countless times, I still search for them on Youtube and listen to them now! 
I would highly recommend anyone to watch this anime even though it is lengthy but still so amazingly good!",10
"
                Anyone who does not like Deus Ex Machina and plot points that seem to be hastily shoved into place should not watch this Anime. And any fans of the original FMA Anime should tread carefully. While this is still a fairly good show there are many things that just don't work.
It's always a shame to see good characters go to waste. Ed and Al are two interesting kids who will do no growing or learning over the course of 64 episodes, they began and end their journey the same as they started it albeit with a varying degree of limbs. 
Our story centers around a
                  generic good vs evil plot, where those that fall under the banner of evil show no real reasons or proper motivations for their actions aside from the authors needing a villain. Why do the homonculi want to help Father? Because a villain needs henchmen. Why does the Dwarf in the Flask want power? Because why not.  It's a shame the story is such lackluster since the world it's built in feels so vivid and inviting. 
But even a greater shame then the villains would have to be the supporting cast of the good guys. Ed and Al don't develop or change but they are still interesting, the same can not be said for their companions. An odd medley of alchemists, soldiers, and chimera all fighting for the greater good and barely an interesting one among them. If you want to watch this series and find some good characterization, pay attention to Ling and Greed. They are the only characters that actually seem to grow, change, and have real conflict within this story.
As a final point I would like to say that while both FMA and FMA:B use death as a major driving force for characters FMA:B can almost be laughed at for even attempting this. Characters with no actual characterization are killed off and we are expected to see this as a shame and a reasonable excuse for a major characters actions. If your flashback scene for a character can only consist of ""Hello, I'm [Name]."" and two other boring statements with no real barring, then this character should never be used to develop major plot points.",7

                Alright, first review.... Please bare with me here.
Story-10
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMAB) has an fantastic story. Its pacing at first is faster then I'd expect, since the '03 FMA's first few episodes were some of its most developing, but it quickly makes up for any lack of development later on in the show. It's also has the perfect length at 64 episodes, as if it were any shorter, I'd personally think it was a bit too short, and if it were any longer, too long. Everything is great, from the emotional beginning to the truly epic ending.
Art-9
FMA:B is animated gorgeously. Anything from its talking scenes, to
                  drama scenes, to action scenes, all look great.
Sound-9
I'm going to get this out of the way right now: I loved every single one of these openings/endings. They were all great songs that fit the point of the show they were at. As for the OST, its still great, but I really sense that they used the same tracks over more times than I'd like.
I watched FMA:B both subbed and dubbed, and I actually have to say that I like the dub more than the sub. Vic Mignogna  does a perfect job as Edward, and everyone else does great returning to their older Characters from FMA '03.
Characters-10 
The characters is definitely one of FMA:B's strong suits in my opinion. You feel for every character, main or side, villain or hero. All characters are fleshed out and feel real. In two different episodes, you can see Edward actually grow taller, and that's TRUE character development.
Enjoyment-10
I truly love this anime. It made me laugh, smile, tear up, made me full adrenaline, and all at once sometimes. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite anime, and probably always will be. It truly deserves everyone's enjoyment.
Overall: 9.5/10",9

                Look, I can see why this anime is really loved, but I just don't think it's that good. 
No, this is not a troll, and I think it's silly that people might think I'm trolling simply because I don't like a show, but when it's the highest rated anime on the sight I can probably come to expect some hate. But Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is just not that good. 
For one, the pacing is really messed up. In the first season (12 episodes) we jump from past to present and zoom through something I can tell was probably a really important part of the story,
                  and it left me with no way of attaching myself to any of the characters. Several characters die and impact the story and the mains but it's so rushed that as a part of the audience I can't find it in myself to care, really. It seemed like they were plot devices. 
Another thing I think is bad is the way things are revealed. Without getting too much into spoilers, we're kept in the dark of a character's past until some part of the story like 40 episodes in, and then all of a sudden it's dropped on us and we're expected to get it. The anime also has a lot of ""philosophical"" undertones, I guess, but the philosophies are really weak and surface level. Such as Edward in the first few episodes when he's in that town and talks to the Rose character, telling her that humans can be made with ingredients found in the town market and that alchemists are atheistic because they know these things--but Edward has SEEN god. This, also, is conveyed after the fact, which just makes it even more confusing. 
And really my biggest issue with the anime is that there seems to be an inconsequential bit of tension. IT's so repetitive. Ed and Al fall apart and we all know they'll just get put back together again The whole reason Ed has automail is so that it can get wrecked in the story so he seems to be in danger. Nothing ever comes of it! By the end all the characters are pretty much the same, no development has been done, but the show has a Disney ending anyway because, for some reason, a show with philosophical undertones needs to end happily. 
The animation was really good, and I enjoyed fight scenes well enough, even if a power like alchemy is poorly explained. It looked good all the way through, and there's no character designs I dislike either, but they use the same music tracks over and over in the show and I started to get tired of the music overall. I will say this, though, the openings and endings are pretty top notch. 
So overall I didn't really like this show at all. My biggest thing is that I think this show has a high score because it came at a time that anime was booming, and it successfully adapted the source material in a way that the original failed to do. You know everyone says ""the book is better than the movie"" even when the movie was good? That's because, for some reason, people just think the thing that came first is better. So when a bad show is made from a bad manga, people think it's good because it stays faithful, but I don't like it. If you did, that's fine, but you have to remember that the philosophy is weak, the characters don't develop, and the ending is predictable.",4
"
                Let me start by saying this: This review is only helpful if you haven't seen the first FMA. Shocking, I know, but people like this do exist.
Alright, I've seen 12 episodes of FMA Brotherhood.
1) The animation is stellar, the action is gorgeous, and scene arrangement ensure a smooth, liquid pacing that ensures you're never bored.
2) The music, the voice actors, everything is great. I can't review sound - go watch and listen!
3) The characters are fantastic.  The only character I hate is Ed, shockingly enough.  I know, how can you enjoy a series and hate the main character? As far as I can
                  tell, Ed is the male equivalent of a Tsundere, meaning as they develop how he actually thinks and feels, I'll grow to love him.  I hope.
The other characters, and there are a lot of them, carry the show.  Someone is constantly looking to have something done or has some agenda, and characters with conflicting agendas manifest naturally.  This makes for a gorgeous multi-linked plot that is getting both hectic but staying steady and clear.
4) Story: FMA Brotherhood is a show about two brothers making a mistake and then trying to fix it.  At least, on the surface.  It becomes rapidly clear a whole lot of other things are going on, and these things will doubtless lead our intrepid heroes down down down the rabbit hole until we find ourselves at the heart of some crazy hair brained world reaching plot.  Or at least, that is my anticipation.
The brotherhood dynamic, as cited in the title, actually doesn't seem like the critical plot focus to me thus far.  It plays an integral role, and parts along the way are definitely fleshing it out, but the real enjoyment from the series lies in the varied assortment of individuals you are meeting along the way.  I've read some of the other reviews, and they state these characters aren't being fleshed out enough.  Given the fact that the series hasn't ended yet, I'm desperately hoping this is true!  Good story telling is done by slowly shaving down to the core of what characters are.  Imagine my surprise in Ep. 11 to discover Roy Mustang isn't secretly a bad guy, in spite of how he is originally portrayed, and how I originally perceived him to be.  At this critical moment for him, my feelings about him completely toggled over to one where, hey, I know exactly who this guy is, and I like him a lot more for it.
5) Enjoyment: The show makes me lose sleep waiting for it to come out to view.  That should indicate just how much I love it so far.  I will say this: As long as they keep the quick pace up and keep chipping away at the truth, Brotherhood will become a stellar classic, making people wonder why there was any doubt as to where it was going.
I compare its pacing, and plot advancement solely to Code Geass for how quick and consistent it runs.
***I've just now obtained FMA (the original) and started to watch it, struggled through about 12 episodes, and threw in the towel. It was boring, Brotherhood has spoiled me.  I hope this doesn't offend original viewers, but all that other stuff in there is fluff to what Brotherhood is portraying as plot critical, and since my mind is full of Brotherhood thoughts, well...",9

                When the original Fullmetal Alchemist series released, it was praised as one of the greatest anime ever. This series wasn't created to replace that position, but as more people read the continuing manga version of the story, more people likely wished for an animated series featuring that original plot. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood seems to be that original story, yet I couldn't confirm it myself as I haven't read the manga and only watched the original series. Many people claim it a strong point that this is the original author's intended direction of the plot, and that may be true, but I would say this specific
                  adaptation of the manga is likely not a good representation of the manga's fame.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is now praised ahead of the original series and is treated as one of the best anime ever created. I would personally disagree with that point, but not to the extent of calling it bad. This version of Fullmetal Alchemist stands out as one of the most complex shounen tales I have ever witnessed, while still carrying many of the shounen cliches. It has a big budget behind it, despite holding a smaller viewer base on its televised premiere than the original, and that budget shows.
From mentioning budget, I'd first like to cover the audio and visuals of Brotherhood. The visuals are some of the best I've seen and you can really tell it was made by Bones. The show is overflowing with visual attentions to detail that stick between scene transitions, and you will very rarely notice something missing. There are a variety of locations with great levels of detail in their backgrounds, and the animation is always there to serve motion. Despite some of the animation being a bit wonky, the show holds a good amount of great action.
The soundtrack leaves a bit more to be desired. While the tracks that do exist are very unique, there isn't enough variety in the tracks available to correctly display every emotion a story like Fullmetal Alchemist needs to convey. The original series had plenty of action-oriented tunes to play, but this version seems to only have about three available and you'll hear them in just about every fight. In a shounen, action-adventure you'd expect more of a priority in that type of soundtrack instead of quieter, less-memorable ones. The soundtrack isn't as orchestrated as the original, and the music sounds very electronic at times, but the soundtrack isn't bad in its own right.
On a final note towards budget: The openings/endings of this show are generally above-average, but none really express a feeling of excitement or anticipation and are usually softer, not really catching the feeling of the series. The last ending song was the most memorable by the simple notion that it fit better with what was actually going on in the series at the time. Mentioning timing, it should also be noted that there is quite a lot of odd placements and cut-offs of music in Brotherhood, and there are close to a dozen times when it will even conflict with the emotions you should be having in the story.
Beyond budget, the ""true"" story of Fullmetal Alchemist is a long and imaginative one. With the length of the manga, I could safely assume that Brotherhood doesn't cover a large percentage of the manga's details. This is where things start to stumble from the potential this series had. In the original series of Fullmetal Alchemist, there was a variety of unconnected problems and issues to deal with that kept things interesting. In Brotherhood, however, the show puts all of its focus onto one, single plot-goal, barely ever straying from that goal. Making a series of over sixty episodes needs some variety or twists to keep things interesting, but Brotherhood severely lacks in that aspect.
The first dozen episodes start with an almost episodic nature, speeding through content that correlates with the original series. That could be justified by this being a supplement to the original series, but that only makes Brotherhood less sturdy on its own feet in the process. The show strikes a point shortly where an interesting plot begins. Even at that point the entire outcome of that plot is very predictable, but it serves some intrigue through the encounters it creates. However, it soon begins to drag as characters begin to do less and plan more of how to get from point A to point B in order to head to their predictable destination. There are no twists in this time to bring another rise in interest and the show assumes that one plot is enough. What the original series did to combat that is take what is treated as a secondary plot in Brotherhood (the regaining of Ed and Al's bodies, which is learned at the beginning) and put more focus on it, bringing out more detail and development. Brotherhood even pushes that to the side and fuels itself off of character interaction between a growing list of non-developed characters.
Brotherhood had two chances to fix this problem with the direction they chose to go. One solution could have been to make the series longer and make more side-plots and more development in other characters to make the viewers care more for them. That would also fix the huge pacing issue that can be seen in the beginning, and throughout most of the show. The second route they could've taken, still focusing on this one plot, is shortening the entire show to about half its length and cutting out unnecessary details.
Instead, Brotherhood focuses on the technicalities of fixing a large, yet predictable, situation. Choosing that path could still bring some interest if the dialogue was top-notch, but it just isn't at that level in Brotherhood. The planning the characters do to solve obstacles in their path is generally interesting and somewhat smart with the fantasy elements it has in place, but the terminology most of the characters use (in the english dub at least) is generally simple and very particular. You'll be hearing a lot of simple and repeated phrases for describing situations, and that is a large amount of the dialogue. Character interactions don't delve too much within the pasts and minds of each character, and development is barely made. Even the main characters, Ed and Al, almost feel like side characters after the first dozen of rushed episodes.
So we have a problem with pacing, a lack of focus towards variety in story and plot, a lack of soundtrack elements to correctly display moods, and I may even say a lack of style. The presentation of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood feels more in tune to getting to the point and rushing the way there. It never takes the time to introduce the viewer to the story and practically acts like a slideshow of what happens here and thereafter. There's barely any clever camera angles or attentions to detail in a consistent and unique style like the original, but there are plenty of details in the technicalities of the leading plot.
I have a great feeling that the story of the manga had great potential of creating one of the best animated series around, but this attempt just falls short on direction. While the technical aspects of the manga's main plot are likely in place, it seems the director and screenwriter forgot to take into account that they are translating the story to film, not treating the film as the manga. A manga and a show are two different things that have different opportunities to be unique. Although the director of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was involved in the creation of the acclaimed movie ""Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door"", there's a reason that he worked solely on the storyboards.",8
"
                Regardless of what's going on this time around, after episode one I am convinced that this FMA is definitely worth the watch. The story seems to take place sometime before the first FMA, but it's really hard to tell.
From what I've gathered it's sticking really closely to the manga this time around. As for the overall awesomeness of the animation, its seriously a 10. The action and the fighting are great and the animation is smooth and amazing. 
It's interesting to see the voice of Urahara as Roy Mustang (one of my fav Bleach characters is ROY?! lol) and Ed and Alphonse are the same
                  as last time. 
So yeah, based on only seeing the first episode its definitely a must watch in my opinion, but this is coming from a hardcore fan of the first Fullmetal Alchemist. ENJOY!",9
"
                I know that writing a review after only seeing 10 episodes isn't really fair. But I just thought I'd share my opinion on it. 
After watching and entirely loving Fullmetal Alchemist I decided to watch Brotherhood. The very first scene was entirely different, and this continued throughout the rest of the episodes that I watched. After coming from FMA, the change in character behaviour and attitude was a complete shock. I couldn't bring myself to watch the rest of the series out of fear of ruining FMA completely.

                Fascinating. When Bones announced Brotherhood, I was like ‘You want to sell us the same story again, huh? That’s really greedy, you bastards!’ Well, I still think that Bones did it for money. Of course they did, because that is how industry works. But after spending about half a year of my life on watching Brotherhood, I have to admit that this show is worth every single yen it will earn.
Brotherhood is a ridiculous phenomenon to me. It subverted all my criteria for choosing anime to watch. I always preferred ranobe-based shows to manga-based, and I never liked long-runners. Y’see, my ideal was some 13-episode
                  bittersweet anime based on a sci-fi novel with some cute girls or something. That doesn’t resemble Brotherhood at all, right? But I cannot find a single clue to not liking the new Fullmetal Alchemist series.
Brotherhood’s plot is nearly flawless. (I still have some questions, but I always have them, so screw me.) The first anime was good, but it played out somewhere in the middle, when its plot overran the manga. There is no such problem in the second anime. Even more, its plot goes epic near the end. Well, the word ‘epic’ is not even enough here. If English had a single word for ‘oh god, so epically epic’, that would be a better choice. And plus the skilful character development… Elric brothers actually grew up throughout the series. And there are a lot more characters with their own individualities, y’know. Arakawa Hiromu-shi is damn genius in this field, no kidding. Call me a sexist, but I never thought that female mangaka can create a plot so twisted, exciting and based on pure logic. Like, remember that episode when… Oh, I can’t bring examples without spoiling something. Bad, but let’s better proceed to next aspect.
Only objective issue I can bring here is that the beginning was a bit fast, but that’s okay since Bones already covered that part of the story in the first show. However, if you didn’t watch that, you’ll find that first episodes of Brotherhood are somewhat rushed.
Another amazing thing here is that Bones managed to keep animation quality on a high level for the whole duration of Brotherhood. They really approached this show with all responsibility. That’s praiseworthy, right?
And the last aspect is music. The first anime was notable for its catchy opening and ending themes, and Brotherhood continued its tradition. Alchemist has one of the best soundtracks in anime, I think.
Oh god, I already ran out of themes to discuss. Without anything to criticize, I always have a vocabulary shortage. So, the summary: Brotherhood is a great anime. It easily overwhelms the first one in terms of enjoyment. Hell, it may be the best shōnen show about the guys with superpowers that was ever made. Some people can dislike Brotherhood for its popularity or annoying fans, but every good series receive this kind of treatment. Y’know, fandom is fandom and anime is anime. It’s a bad thing to mix those up.
Well, giving Brotherhood 10 points will make me sound like a fanboy, but jeez, I already sound like one and I’m okay with that. I can recommend it as an example of awesome shōnen series to all anime fans, from narutards to those carriers of eternal wisdom, who think that every show which has more than 100 fans is a hyped-up kuso for brainless masses. 10 points, that’s it.",10

                Before I get started, I should say that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite anime series and favorite television show in general. I prefer it over the first anime, but I did watch Brotherhood first which may bias that, though the ending of Brotherhood is definitely better and I really enjoy many of the characters that the first anime excluded.
The story of Brotherhood is one of the best ever created, following the storylineof he manga (Fullmetal Alchemist). It is the longest showI have ever watched which has practically no filler at all with just about every event in the story contributing to the overall plot
                  in some way, even if you don't know it will at first. The story follows the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse, on their journey to find a philosopher's stone so that they can get back Al's body and Ed's arm and leg which they lost several year ago when they tried to bring their deceased moher back to life with alchemy but failed. Ed becomes a state alchemist with title Fullmetal Alchemist which he uses to help his research as he and Alphonse travel around the country searching for leads. Along the way, they meet Homunculi (seeingly immortal beings named after the 7 deadly sins who are te main antagonists of the series), Scar (a man who seeks revenge on state alchemists for starting a war against his people and killing them), and friends like Ling (a prince from another country seeking imortality), and other state alchemists and officials who help him like Roy Mustang and Maes Hughes.
The art in FMAB is exceptional and just as good in the beginning as it is in he end. The fight scenes are well designed and show an amazing amount of detail. The one thing to note is that this show has a large amount of blood (especially in the fights with the homunculi who can survive even if their bodies are cut in half many times). The sound goes along very well with tracks that fit the mood perfectly (my personal favorie being ""Pride's Theme,"" a very creepy song that fits Pride [a homunculus] very well).
The characters in FMAB are some of the best. Edward Elric is my favorite anime character. Ed is a short, blonde boy who los his right arm and left leg which are now replaced with automail. He is the youngest state alchemist ever due to his abilit to transmute (the act of doing alchemy) without a transmuation circle (which he gained at the same timehe lost his arm an leg). Alphonse is Ed's younger brother whose soul resides in a large suit of armor which was the result of Ed's last-ditch effort to save his brother after failing t bring their mother back to life. Al is often mistaken for the Fullmetal Alchemist due to this which annoys Ed (plus Al's now taller than his shorter, older, brother). Winry Rockbell is Ed and Al's childhood friend and Ed's automail mechanic who created his leg and arm.
Some of my other favorite characters are Envy (one of the homunculi who can shapeshift and disguise himself [his gender is never actually determined] which basially makes him the troll of this show), Roy Mustang (the Flame Alchemist who wants to become the military leader of the country in place of King Bradley one day and works with Ed and Al at times though Ed doesn't really like him much at first), Riz Hawkeye (the kin of woman who obliterates any stereoptypes about women, she is Mustang's most trustworthy soldier and helps protect him her badass-ness), Ling Yao (the prince from another country who seeks immortality, though saying much abou him would be a spoiler; accompanying Ling are Lan Fan and Fu who are his personal bodyguards and will lay their lives down to protect him [Lan Fan follows in Riza's badass, stereotype-destroying footsteps]), and Maes Hughes (a militaryman who loves his family, his friends, his family, being cheerful, and of course his faily [want to see a picture of his daughter?]).
I enjoyed every second of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The ending is one of the best ever, the characters are some of the best ever, the story has many plot twists but none that seem forced and the lack of filler keeps the story moving at all times making you want more and bringing you back for each episode. I really can't any fault with show.
I highly recommend this show for every anime fan. It is my personal favorite show frm any medium (anime or not).",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is 44 episodes of pure enjoyable character development, all leading up to a truly epic 20 episode climax. 
The art in FMA is very pleasing to the eyes and the animations are beautiful.
All of the openings and ending are awesome and really get you in the mood for what you are about to watch, personally my favorite opening was the 2nd one while my favorite ending was the 4th.
As I said before FMA has tons of character development, so much in fact that I found myself even getting attached to support characters.
While the series might not hook you right away it will
                  DEFINITELY all be worth it at the end :) Trust me Everything gets wrapped up at the end as well which doesn't happen a whole lot now a days. Animes as great as FMA don't come around very often making this is a must watch for anyone who watches anime!",10
"
                Oh, where do I start?
FMA: Brotherhood it's one of those series that gets you addicted very easily and  watching just one episode doesn't feel right.
The art is great, with good transitions between a more comic or more serious scene. The alchemy animations are very well done and the fighting sequences doesn't feel dull or forced.
The voices are perfect. Every character has a voice that really suits their personality which makes it more enjoyable and credible. The openings are very very good, with the music really complementing on the sequences.
The characters are simply amazing. Well thought, each one well developed, and not just focused on
                  2 or 3 main characters, but on all of them with care. 
Like I said before, when you are watching this series, one or two episodes aren't enough to satisfy your hunger to know more and more, and each one is very important for the big plot.
It truly is a Masterpiece.",10
"
                This is a very easy review.  This show does not hold up on its own in anyway shape or form. It literally requires you to have read the manga or seen the previous anime.  The original series diverged from the manga and became something truly special because of it.  Brotherhood, while being very true to the manga moves at such absurd speeds as to literally ruin it.  It leaves absolutely no room for characters to establish themselves or breathe.  The show assumes you're either a fan of the previous anime or the manga and does nothing but pander endlessly to
                  people who claim ""BEST EVER"" because they get to see their favorite character in their favorite scene.  It's a real shame, because there was a lot of potential here ruined by Bones pandering towards the established fans.  The series slows down to an acceptable pace at around the twentieth episode, but by then the damage is already done. 
Other than its problems with pacing, story and characterization, the art and animation are fantastic.   The voice acting in both languages is superb.  The soundtrack really works well with it as well.",3

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
FMA: Brotherhood is an anime that i enjoyed a lot, i wish i watched this before, after friends telling me to watch it, i wasn't sure because i thought it was too long, now i even feel it was short and left me wanting a little more but at the same time glad for the conclusion.
Story
It starts almost predictable for me, talking about the plot, it appears a guy, an ex statal alchemist killing statal alchemists because he found out about a secret that the militia is doing something and he wants to stop them and at that part i was making my
                  bets about what he was talking and if he was really a ''bad'' guy, (turns out i was right about it, and not just that one but a lot more) then i thought the story wasn't going to surprise me, but it was the opposite, it did surprised me a lot of times; I got to point out that the story is well made and told with little noticeable flaws, the story is not just about the adventure of Ed and Al to retrieve their bodies back but is about finding out the truth behind what they're looking and how it connects to the people, the country and the fate of all, meeting new people that will help them and some old friends too, finding about their stories. The story will make you shed some tears for unexpected people and humanoids, feel sorry for murderous guys, even if you hated them, you will feel empathy for their reasons of being like that, the ending was good, with a final scene of a photo that i liked and that's why i think the story is outstanding.
Art & Animation
The art style was not amazing but it sure was very good and the animation too, with great fight scenes but sometimes those fight scenes and art style were dropping quality at certain scenes the character design is not my favorite but it was good, i think the FMA from early 2000 had a better animation and i only saw some eps. when it was aired in CN but in general it was very good.
Sound
The background music is really good the same can be said about the first OP that has beautiful vocals and reminded me of Maoyuu's OP, the first ED was good too, the rest were meh, too many OPs and EDs, for me that amount was unnecessary and they give spoilers, the VA was great, if it wasn't for that amount of OPs and EDs the sound could have been outstanding but for that it's just great.
Character
The amount of great and outstanding characters is high, everyone is interesting and great villains that are despicable but somehow the creator made you care for them.
-Edward Elric is the big brother of Alphonse, who may not look strong but he is despite his inmature personality and his anger at everyone who calls him little; He's good hearted and always wants to save people.
-Alphonse Elric is the little brother, more mature but at the same time could be more naive than Ed, he's even more kind hearted than Ed.
-Winry is like the little or at times big ''sister'' of the Elric brothers kicking their asses when they get in trouble or creating trouble for them.
-Izumi Curtis is the sensei that teached alchemy to Ed and Al and she beat the life out of them, she is a great character.
-Roy Mustang is the one who started the brothers to be statal alchemists and a great one of the most powerful characters but at the same time useless under water, he is a great leader aiming to be the new Fuhrer so he can help and protect people.
-Scar is an Ishvalith who is seeking revenge against every statal alchemist that was or wasn't involved in the Ishvalith war, a powerful character.
-Yao Ling is great full of ambition and at the same time determination of reaching his goal of becoming the Emperor of Xing no matter what, friendly and deadly, he will be a real friend to Ed, and a bother to him.
-May Chang is a little girl that is seeking for the same thing that Ling, to become the Ruler of Xing.
-Kimblee was a little disappointing because i thought he was going to be more dangerous than what he looked or what he did, he was the only let down of a character.
-Van Hohenheim is the father of the Elric's and someone with a though past and that past leads him to abandon his family, he's one great character.
And a big amount of great characters, like the Armstrong family, Hugh Maes, the various Chimeras, Greed, Hawkeye, Prof. Marcoh, Envy, Father, King Bradley, Bucaneer, Miles and the list goes and goes, is a big great cast of memorable outstanding characters.
Enjoyment
This is for me a flawed masterpiece, i recognize like any other the flaws but i have to follow the enjoyment i had, it was superb, it was outstanding, i was never bored and kept watching the next eps. when i could, the ending was good but i wanted more even with a good conclusion.",10

                Alright. Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. Everything about this anime was amazing and simply brilliant. The story was always keeping the 'watcher' wanting to keep watching no matter what.( I found myself staying up way later than I planned to keep watching this series) Every concept in this anime (Alchemy and Alkahestry) was simply fantastic learning about and watching it be used from creating giant flipping fists punching people in battle to saving peoples lives. Anyone who has watched this anime(or read the manga) probably agrees with me that they would give anything for our world to have Alchemy. And also,THERE ARE NO FILLERS, *laughs like
                  a madman*
The Art in FMA Brotherhood was simply fantastic. Watching the magnificent view of the Resembool country side to every small detail of the tediously created alchemy circles to every fight scene; the breathtaking and epic animations were clearly shown in every episode. All the fights had more... oomph, than those in FMA. There was more fight and felt like you were actually there. They were more dramatic and more gruesome(gruesome being a good thing)
The sound in FMA Brotherhood was fantastic as well. All the ending and beginning songs were spectacular.(as well as their animations) Much effort was put into every sound. The sound of a transmutation circle going off, the clapping of hands for Ed's alchemy, agonizing screams of people who loose limbs or are mortally wounded, well thought out speech for every character; they were all fantastic.
The Characters were spectacular as well as everything else. Every Character was fabulous and played an important role for the overall story. The only problem I had involving characters was that the main antagonist's personality was boring. He didn't seem interesting enough. Another minor problem with one of the characters, I would have given anything for Sloth to say, ""What a drag."" instead of, ""What a pain"" (if anyone got that reference)(hm, that may be considered copyright, I don't know)
Enjoyment, damn right I enjoyed this anime. Without hesitation, I put it as my top and most favorite anime. Two other things I would like to point out that I also enjoyed about this anime. The great amount of suspension and action leading up to the Promise Day and how burly men.(in Brotherhood it's Major Armstrong and Sig Curtis, forgot who it is in FMA) There was I was literally crying from how funny it was, how they compete against each other with muscles and gain each others respect. Then see them handshake. One of my most favorite things about this anime. 
The first time I watched through FMA and FMA Brotherhood, I hated everything about Brotherhood but loved FMA. I don't know why. Rewatching both of them, I've found that I love Brotherhood a 100, no, a thousand times better than FMA. I hated the FMA ending but loved everything about Brotherhood. I don't know what I was thinking.
Overall, I would recommend this to anyone, it's long enough where it's not as short as those 12 or 24 episode anime and then ends abruptly. FMA brotherhood has a pretty damn good ending(better than most), well I mean sure it could have gone on for another episode or two to explain some things *cough* *cough* Winry and that stuff. Anyways, if you watched FMA and wondering if you should watch Brotherhood, WATCH IT. If you've already watched both of them, I hope you agree with me that Brotherhood is superior, watch it again because it never gets old.",10
"
                 This is one of the greatest anime's I have ever seen in my life. After watching this show more then three times it is truly perfect. Characters and character development is amazing. The story line has you thinking is one of the most original stories I have ever seen. The sound and openings are great. The art style fits the anime perfectly and it brings out the personality of the characters. Overall this is truly the greatest anime.
              ",10
"
                I prefer the first one. I'm here to say that if you don't get all the hype about Brotherhood its okay.
That said I think the ending of Brotherhood was all around put together 5x as well. In all the anime was pretty good and was pretty interesting, but I don't get why it averages such high ratings. I prefer the sad ending of the first one, but the story had already fallen apart by that point. Brotherhood on the other hand knew exactly where it was going and attempted to get there at 10x the speed of the first one and with 1/3rd the character
                  development.
Believability: I would prefer Brotherhood's composition with the first one's story. I just didn't find it that believable. What can make a break a story's believability is the action scenes. Every single antagonist that they fought in Brotherhood should have won. The only fights that could conceivably end in a win were ones with Scar and the only reason I think that is because Scar is a bamf. The biggest hit to the believability of the story was everything to do with the main antagonist. Everything about him including how he lost is hard for me to believe and made it impossible for me to immerse myself in the story. If you care less about how believable the means are and care more about the results, then Brotherhood is great for you.
*****Spoiler Section*******
- For people who want specific examples of what i mean when i talk about the            fight scenes I have provided a few examples below:
-Fight with  Pride: This is the fight I look back to when I try to recall an example. It is simply ridiculous. Why didn't Pride just stab them where they weren't blocking? There is no reason except the plot. They had to beat him therefore they did. Every time Ed blocked all of Pride's spikes with his one arm I did a facepalm. 
-Fight with Lust: She can just spear you with her ""Ultimate Spear.""  She is unbeatable except when she needs to be beaten for the plot to progress.
-Fight with Greed: There was actually no problem with this fight technically, but Greed supposedly had the ""Ultimate Armor"" and yet he has fairly obvious weak points all over his body? There are no huge weaknesses to the other homunculi abilities and yet his is made inferior just by that fact of him being a homunculus? When I think about him I remember how Ed beat him in the first one. His armor had no real weakness, Ed just used his brain and made the armor not armor.
-For those who have seen the anime and wonder what I found unbelievable about Father I have provided a few things below:
Alchemy: How did Father not know about the foreign versions of Alchemy. He was made of the stuff in the first place. That simply makes no sense.
His Death: Talk about cliche... Ed fit into every single male protagonist cliche when he fought Father. Somehow a guy who can do above average Alchemy can beat a being made from the stuff, who can use alchemy with a thought? What!? One might make the argument that Father was out of energy during their fight. Well... isn't that convenient. He could have squashed them at any other time, but didn't because he correctly assumed they were nowhere close to his strength. It is the classic villain loses because of his own arrogance instead of any real actions taken by the heroes. It just seemed like the story could have simply been about Father and how he tried to become God and failed because it wasn't possible and have no mention of any of the main characters except to have them kick start his ritual.",7
"
                This anime is about two brothers fighting to regain their bodies after a alchemy experiment gone wrong. Along the way they uncover an evil plot and pick up many companions. 
Plot: Think of a very linear anime like Fist of the North Star, where Kenshiro travels from village to village, challenge to challenge, always moving forward, always exploding heads and never revisiting any of the places he’s conquered. FMA is the opposite. It actually reminded me of an RPG videogame the way the characters would travel back and forth between cities and how these locations would change between visits. For example, Edward goes from the
                  Central city to the East, back to central to deal with new shit, visits Winry in his village, goes to central again to deal with new shit before heading to another city in the far East to deal with even more shit etc… I love this because it makes understanding the geography of Amestris important and allows the viewer to explore the country with Ed/Al.
Pacing: The series starts out doing a great job showing how characters get from point A to point B but then they get lazy. About halfway through the series characters start jumping between cities without proper explanation of how they got there. For some people it’s irrelevant but to me, it gives the impression that the characters simply teleported. I mean how does a little girl magically get from the frozen tundra of the north of the country’s eastern desert in between episodes? I’d like to know. Now do I want them to devote ½ of the series’ screen time to train rides? No. But it could have used smoother transitions.
Also, By season 3 the cast gets large enough to where the episodes switch between 4-5 different character groups in different parts of the country. In theory this is good because it adds intricacy to the plot. The problem I have with FMA is that they will leave one storyline on a cliffhanger to switch to a relatively uneventful storyline. For example, they’ll leave Edward bleeding and half dead in a frozen wasteland just to switch to Al and Winry helping villagers build houses. It’s one thing if you follow Game of Throne’s style of switching from cliffhanger to cliffhanger but in this case I thought they could have cut out some of the fluff to make the story arc pacing a little smoother.
Action: I always like it when anime introduces a new fighting style. FMA does this with the addition of alchemy. The fight scenes are cool, creative and diverse. I also liked how even though Ed was a badass his friends didn't become useless or obsolete (aka like Goku's friends).
Comedy: This deserves its own section. Basically it’s pretty simple, if you like anime-style, slapstick, comedic moments you’re going to jizz yourself every almost episode if you don’t, you won’t stop rolling your eyes. There’s probably a Japanese term for it but it’s the comedy that involves fainting/nose bleeds after embarrassing moments, extreme facial distortions when angry, sleeping snot bubbles, huge skull blisters appearing after a friendly wrench beating. I found it a little much to be honest and it gave the anime a much lighter tone. Some people will love it though.
Sound: I really liked the English dubs. Great voice acting cast. I didn’t care for the intros/outros, but the music sound track was solid.
Art: Good 
Characters: Great memorable characters with very vibrant personalities. I thought the concept of the homunculi was brilliant and their personalities, despite embodying single sins, were very complex and interesting—especially Greed, Wrath and Envy. Oh and Scar is one of the most badass antiheroes in anime. My only complaint is that they spent a LOT of time developing smaller side characters and not a lot of time killing them off. I mean yeah it’s good to develop support characters but by the end of the series the cast felt a little clunky. I mentioned this earlier but even in a 64 episode series you only have so much screen time. Instead of devoting time to exploring the thoughts, struggles and emotions of minor henchmen and tagalongs, why not spend it on the mains who are so much more interesting? Using the law of equivalent exchange, I would have liked FMA to transmute some side characters into more screen time for underdeveloped plots like Winry-Ed, backstories of Homunculi, Scar’s story, Father, etc. 
Overall: I am 90% satisfied. I think I would have been at 100% if this series could have been a little shorter or a lot longer. Basically if they had trimmed it down or spent the extra time to make everything complete. Everyone always raves about the ending but to be honest I still wanted more.
Blood/Gore: It’s surprisingly bloody for a MA14+ anime. Severed limbs, bullet wounds, human sacrifice…mixed in with slapstick comedy.
Love/Romance: Yes, there is a romantic subplot that develops very, very slowly over the series but it’s not the main focus. The “Action/Romance” genre is often attempted but seldom done well. It usually turns out to be an action anime w/ a clumsy love-interest side-plot or a sappy romance story with 2nd rate action. Either way the non-dominant side just becomes a plot device for the other one. Personally, I’m not really into sappy romance animes but I like it when a romantic subplot is done right and can make me care about a couple’s mutual survival in the context of a larger struggle (Mirai Nikki, Gosick). Anyway FMA does that well but I thought it could have been done better. 
Sex/Nudity: Laura Bailey’s voice is pure sex. 
Look out for:
Episode 42, 15:00 “Now that he’s taken a monster like you into his flesh”
Episode 54, 10:50 an unfathomably homoerotic scene.",9

                Let me start off by saying that this is my first review so go easy o.O
I saw the first FullMetall Alchemist series and loved it. I was hooked from episode one when they aired it on Cartoon Network. Being the somewhat impatient person I am, I went online searching for the next episode one night after the tenth or eleventh episode had finished. I found what I was looking for and found that there were 52 episodes waiting to be downloaded! Yes, you can assume this anime is what made me discover fan subbing -_^. Anyway, the anime was great, I couldn't get enough when
                  the series ended on that metal fist grabbing at the sun. Not too much later I discovered that a movie was coming out and it was the completion of the anime series that had finished. Needless to say, I was excited, I enjoyed the FINAL conclusion of the story. Now that I've said all this, I wanted to say that I always felt like there were ""holes"" in the story. Like, information that was there but not being told. Well...
Not too long ago, I got bored one day, so I looked for some manga to read (FYI Manga/Anime isn't a huge hobby just a coincidence =P) and found the FMA manga. I decided to read it, to see if there was a huge difference between the manga and the anime. I cheated a little bit and started off a bit into the story and discovered that lots of stuff was there that was not in the anime. So, I had to treck back to a point where this information started. I finished the manga in a couple days and WOOOW. Not only was I correct about there being some information missing in the anime, but there was so so so so so much more that was supposed to happen.
So, it's my assumption that this new series is going to follow in the true story of the FMA and the two brother's journey in their alchemy filled fantasy world. So far the story that is being told in the ""Brotherhood"" series is sticking pretty true to the manga. If this is true, please, take my advice, stay tuned. Especially if you were a good fan of the first series or just love a good anime with great plot twists and a great story line. whatever your interest, if my assumption is correct, which I'm 99.9% sure it is, you're all in for a real treat! =)",9
"
                Let me get one thing out of the way before I start this review: “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood” blows its predecessor out of the water! Mind you, this is coming from a guy who found the original Fullmetal Alchemist a rather disappointing experience. That essentially means that I was skeptical when I first started watching this anime, only to be totally shocked by how good it was!
Whether you enjoyed the original, or hated it, this reincarnation of Fullmetal Alchemist has completely changed my opinion of the series as a whole!
Breakdown:
Story (10/10) – I cannot stress enough how much better the story of “Brotherhood” is than the
                  original. If you’re reading this review, you likely know that the original show deviated from the manga after a short while, and continued in a rather different direction. As manga tends so often to be, the story of the manga ends up being much stronger than what the creators of the original anime were able to come up with. “Brotherhood” follows the story of the manga quite closely, thus the anime never feels like filler, or just boring junk.
The first fifteen episodes or so are very similar to about the first half of the original “Fullmetal Alchemist”. “Brotherhood” covers more story in less time, and doesn’t drag nearly like the original did. This is especially apparent in the beginning, where some parts that were already told in the original series were more or less skipped over to save time. Purists might squawk about this, but it was probably a wise idea, in light of time constraints.
If you’ve seen the original Fullmetal Alchemist, then you’ll be familiar with the first major portions of the show. It may feel like a rehash for the first several episodes, but you’ll fairly quickly realize that the scale of what will eventually take place is much greater, and much more sinister than what the original Fullmetal Alchemist conveyed. The twists that Ed and Al are taken through are enough to leave you wanting more after each episode. 
But enough rambling. If you’d like a synopsis, just look one up.
(Art 10/10) – The art in this show is simply superb! Characters and scenery are drawn with careful detail, and they also achieve a sense of realism, which is somewhat necessary in a “Steam-Punk” world that could almost be America a century ago. The mix of realism, combined with the fantasy of Alchemy, creates for an interesting balance that not many animes can achieve. Additionally, the art is very smooth, with each movement flowing into the next seamlessly. There were a few instances where larger or more intricate drawings were done with computer animation. These scenes are slightly choppier than the rest of the anime, but you likely won’t notice unless you’re looking for it.
The only gripe I had with the animation was early on in the show, where characters would burst into silly caricatures  when they were especially emotional about something. Most notably is Ed transforming to look like a praying mantis when someone calls him short. This made it seem like the show didn’t take itself very seriously at first, but such incidents gradually declined as the show progressed, and became rather scarce during the more serious parts of the show. I simply think the show would have benefitted from less outbursts of this nature early on. 
(Sound 9/10) – The voice acting in this show is some of the best you’ll hear. I was pleasantly relieved to hear that there were no annoying, shrill voices that anime can be guilty of at times. There weren’t any standout performances that I can think of, but each actor voiced their role marvelously.
The only reason for a 9 instead of a 10 was that it sounded to me like some of the music had been recycled from the original Fullmetal Alchemist. The music fit the scenes very well, but I thought an update might have been helpful. Also, the music never really stuck out to me as being particularly awesome. It was good, but not quite deserving of a 10.
(Characters 10/10) – It will be quite a struggle to keep my comments succinct on this topic! “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood” shines brilliantly in this area! Never before have I grown so attached to such a diverse cast of characters. There were a number of characters that I wasn’t particularly attached to in the original series that I grew to love in “Brotherhood”.  The show does a brilliant job of making each character’s motivations easy to understand, yet complex enough that they aren’t totally flat.  It also has a way of forcing characters who were once enemies to work together when faced with a common enemy. 
I was especially impressed by how Ed and Al were so much easier to relate to in “Brotherhood”. I found myself much more emotionally attached to them, and had a much stronger desire to see them succeed. Al is much stronger and helps Ed fight much more often, which I also found to be a pleasant change of pace. I could name probably ten other characters who I grew attached to, yet wasn’t terribly fond of in the original series. “Brotherhood” also introduces a set of new characters that blend in perfectly with that cast that I was already familiar with. 
The long and short of it is this: the cast of “Brotherhood” will draw you in and leave you eagerly watching their every move until the conclusion of the series.
(Enjoyment 10/10) – I really don’t have much to say on this topic, except I loved it! I never had to force myself to keep going, and I enjoyed every bit of the show!
(Overall 10/10) – Definitely give this one a shot! It’s well worth your time. And in my opinion, it’s far superior to its  predecessor.",10

                This review will be rather short.
The story is not bad in general, it is just awfully directed. The main reason which caused that I didn't enjoy this anime was pathetic humour which is ruining EVERY episode. For example, there is a situation where main characters are talking about something interesting, and unexpectedly something ""funny"" happens and main thread of their conversation (or even whole episode) is cutted, because ""funny"" situation is most important of course. It is happening in EVERY episode, sometimes few times. Yeah, that 'humour' destroyed the whole story.
But this is not the only reason of course. The next thing: main characters. They
                  are boring. Typical battle shounen scheme. There were a lot episodically characters which were much better and interesting than Erlic brothers and no.1 badass - Bradley King.
I liked the whole idea of philosopher stones and homunculus thing (and their names taken from seven deadly sins)
The plot story is way too episodic too.
Art - I loved that backgrounds. Seriously, it was really well drawn. Animation was nice too. But in other side, almost all characters looked very bad and too simple.
Sound - voice actors were matched really good (as usual in anime). Of course I'm talking about original Japanese voices. Soundtrack is average, I don't like this type of soundtracks (symphonic ones, like from 'Murican blockbuster). It is boring as hell, I'm glad, that it is rather not usual in anime.
Summarizing,I felt like I was watching rather a generic USA movie (trust me, I've seen plenty of them in my life, I started watching anime, because I was bored as hell by hollywood crap) than actual anime.
FMA:B is yet another battle shounen, which are thousands. It is not bad anime, but in my opinin it doesn't deserve to be even in top 50. It would be much better, when it would be 50% shorter and without ALL that pathetic humour.
I watched it, and probably in next year I will totally forget about it.",6

                Well i know about half the world right now is about to curse at me for writing this, but I don't care. . Now for my Take on the so called ""greatest anime of all time"". IMO its pretty damn mediocre. I had watched the original, and thought it ok. Now i had to watch this. Due to my personal dislike of filler i thought id like FMABH. Yet i was sorely disappointed. I tried to go in open minded hoping to enjoy. Yet, found myself bored, I mean very bored. Like watching Bakemonogatari bored. Nothing to me stands out in this show. One it
                  has my least favorite character of all time in it(ok possible there are othr worse characters). Yet people treat Elric as if he was the greatest character. Hes a very very bad character for the number of episodes(more anger from everyone). Let me ask you, why is he fighting? Hes, fighting  to get him and his brother's body back. Its not as if their was some injustice, someone who stole their body. Oh no it was their own foolishness and i didn't feel sorry. Hell i didn't feel sorry during the entire series, Huges dies? who gives a !@#$. it wasn't sad. he went down swinging and he had a family, but rly? Its not like Clannad, (i hate harems but this is sad) and possibly even grave of the fireflies. Those are  sad. Now what ill say it does right sometimes is animation. even though at first i loved the alchemy mechanics,(so cool) it got very repetitive. The fights were smooth, but them, like most of the series became repetitive and i fast forwarded through to get to some plot. Let me now say though some things are great the first op was so good and it got my hopes up. the art was beautiful, and some characters were actually good. such as Hoenhiem or Rath.  Sound such as swords were amazing a true shinning point. Yet in the end what rly killed me was the predictable ending. I was expecting an epic final fight or epic final plot tiwst true Stiens;Gate or Madoka style, yet it was just final bad guy standing there, and guys saying ""FIRE EVERYTHING"". Then bad guy just takes it like a bauws. I did like that he was in it for Knowledge, at least he had a viable reason unlike elric who just lost and arm and a leg,but with automail why even give a !@#$? FMABH to me this is the greatest overrated anime of our time. The people who have this a favorite should rly try to expand out a little, and if it is your fav. well im sorry my opinion greatly differs. To me FMBA is just ""good"" no where does it excel to me, and im glad im over with it. (excuse me while i watch something good like Mushishi or Gintama)",7

                There is not much more to say about this other than that it is THE masterpiece. This anime is perfect in all ways. The variety of characters and personalities developed throughout the characters are what put this show on the top. The light-hearted humorous scenes were well balanced with dark, vicious scenes to create an anime that will keep you on your toes throughout the entire anime. The plot behind the anime is superb along with the detailed fight scenes and lessons that characters learned as a result. Not to mention this anime also has a killer soundtrack and animation to go along with it.
                  The only bad thing about the anime is that all other anime you watch after this will not even compare...",10
"
                I know what some people might be thinking. Why would they ruin an already renowned anime with what will be a likely mediocre continuation?
WRONG.
The new season itself (from the sole episode I've watched so far) can be completely separated from the much loved first season. The director basically clicked the restart button on the series and we are in for a new rollercoaster of madness. This season is rumored to be working closer to the mangas storyline so no confusing other world as we witnessed in the rather -interesting- FMA movie. 
The animation is very fluid and the art is also more true to Hiromu
                  Arakawa's style. Eye candy at it's best, if they are starting off this well FMA The Brotherhood is truly one anime to keep your eyes on.
I already know I won't be disappointed. :3",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist brotherhood is a straight up mediocre show. I came into this anime so excited. I would always hear people say ""its a masterpiece"" or ""its the best anime of all time."" Its even the highest rated anime on mal. I was hyped up and ready to see what the show had to offer. However, I was immensely disappointed. This show is so overrated it is unbelievable. It is so corny and ridiculous I am convinced only children enjoy this show. During ""serious"" fight scenes there are always bursts of unfunny comedy that is just straight up cringey. There is no sense of suspense
                  or nothing that keeps you engaged in the story. The characters are lame (especially that annoying crybaby talking robot boy), the music is meh, the animation is decent for its time. But I mean wow this show is so corny and is obviously targeted towards little kids. Corny does not mean bad tho. However this anime tries to be serious and corny at the same time which just completely ruins the shows atmosphere. This is by no means a masterpiece and should not even be in the top 50. Attack on titan is 10 times better I cannot believe the amount of people that overrate this kids show.",1

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the second adaptation of the full metal alchemist manga. The show presents two brothers embarking a journey with a simple goal of recovering their limbs/body. In the world of Fullmetal Alchemist, a practice called alchemy is used to obtain something in exchange for something of equal value. Alchemy is very versatile in this sense as it used healing, fixing and even fighting. 
Fullmetal alchemist presents a very interesting and enjoyable unique story with each episode building up on one another. It is well paced and consistent with its overall goal. No episodes felt irrelevant to the plot which made every episode
                  worth watching. Its build up with each episode created a very satisfying ending with great twists and turns. It was unpredictable at times and had great action with the use of alchemy.
The characters in Fullmetal Alchemist are very likeable with each character having an ulterior motive. The interactions with the cast provided great entertainment and depth. Character development of the cast was top notch with lots of memorable moments. There are many antagonists in the show with each being labelled as one of the deadly sins. Each one managed to live up to their name having different personalities and motives. 
Overall, I was completely satisfied after watching Fullmetal alchemist Brotherhood. It provided a great coherent story with characters that were very memorable. It receives a high re-watch value and recommendation.",9
"
                Full Metal Alchemist was the anime that started my addiction to anime.
I loved that it spanded over so many episodes and had its own unique little stories, even the fillers had a good reason to be there. It was like being a part of the FMA family. You knew about all the great main characters.
My only minor complaint would be that I wanted more back story about the humonculus, or the date in Ed's pocket watch. I sorta know what It means, but I dont want to go on assumptions. I wanted to know what it meant to Ed.
That being said, Full metal has a
                  place in my heart.
When I read that it was being remade, ofcourse i was in support of it! Full metal alchemist is always welcome again and again.
I have no real problems with the remake, to me it just adds to the whole experience. It isnt better or worse than the ""original"" it just kepes the love alive!
But one thing i was really disappointed with was the animation in brotherhood.
The colors looked so artificial. Like they did the whole thing on Paint or something. There were no natural shades.
To me, the original was beautiful. The tones and colors were perfect. 
Brotherhood kinda let me down in that respect.
On top of that, Im also bummed out about Alphonses voice actor change. The new voice is higher pitched and screechy.
The original was much more subtle in tone and really suited alphonse.
But those are my only complaints.
Had Brotherhood been made just like the original except with the change in story, It wouldve been fantastic to me.",7

                This review isn't going to be as detailed and in-depth as I feel it should be, and while I do address various things, I don't address every single thing I like or dislike about this series. Regarding that, there are some things that stood out to me within this series that definitely would leave it a 5, or maybe even a 4, out of 10 for me. I will also be trying to address things in an overall sense rather than picking out individual details and events to help explain them because if you've seen this show, you know what happens, basically, so you know
                  what I'm talking about without me needing to address every single little thing that happens. That being said, unfortunately, there are some spoilers in this review.
This series was very disappointing, but the fact that it's rated number one on this site honestly doesn't surprise me. First, though, I'll just go over the less significant of the flaws before addressing the deal-breakers. Keep in mind, I did watch the original 2003 anime. Immediately before having started this one. This review is not based on any amount of bias or nostalgia, because I never grew up with FMA, and I finished this last week. I try to draw as few comparisons as I can between the two different shows, as a result.
Pacing issues are a constant theme, apparently. The first season relied too heavily on you having had seen the original anime, or read the manga, which I think is a bad decision because regardless of whether or not similar things had happened, the events that did happen within the first fifth of the series are still fairly important. Season two was alright (I honestly consider it to have been the best season), and season three was good, as well, up until about halfway through, then it started getting a bit slow. Season four was bad, and oh, god, season five. I had no idea what went wrong with season five. It had all started out too fast, then it found the right speed to take things in season two. Season three started getting slow, and then four and five jumped back up to high speeds, even faster than how season one was going, it felt like. It really left out a lot of room for things to be explained, because important matters were discussed in one or two lines of dialogue, and as the series progresses, a lot of build up garners a minimal reward.
There is absolutely no atmosphere in this show. There is no mood at all. What is the mood? What is the tone this is trying to set? The soundtrack has literally ten songs, and the same three are used in every single episode at least once. The only moods set by the music are ""tense"" and ""action,"" and very rarely is it ""cool"". The song that plays during Hohenheim's backstory and during a majority of season five is actually really good, and one of two out of ten songs that I like, but the rest of them are severely overplayed. The present mood is predictable, as a result. The overall mood, however, feels completely nonexistent because there is no emotion in this show. Even people who praise this up and down, I've seen mention how there's no atmosphere and emotion behind anything. How are you supposed to get anything out of it, then? In addition to it having been a result of pacing issues, the backstories and reveals are just treated like nothing, because there's no emotion behind it at all. When they were at Central, I guess, and they were cheering because they thought the Fuhrer was gone but he popped up on the phone and said ""Surprise, I'm back,"" that could have been so cool! But it went immediately from an intense scene, to a slight pause, and then back to the same intensity as it had before. There was no rest at all, and as the series went on, there felt there wasn't any room for emotion because there was just too much going on, and like the emotion was a negligible feature, thus leaving the whole series rather soulless, even during the best parts of the show.
The plot is way too goddamn complex. After a certain point, there is just way too much going on to keep track of, even in the sense of the storyteller's perspective, as characters will appear for one scene and then not return until a whole season later. I honestly thought they forgot about Scar's and Riza's backstories, and characters with NO backstory end up being the most important, such as May Chang. There is so much filler with just nameless generals having gun fights, and it really feels like a completely different show once they get to Briggs. It goes from being a fascinating fantasy story with a unique set of physics taking place in a split timeline to being just a boring military show, preferring gunfights over alchemy and science which is meant to be a main theme of the series, and because of how much screen time the nameless grunts get just shooting each other and the Homunculi, it, again, leaves no time for things to actually be explained. Scar's backstory had been addressed in season two to a degree but there were still unanswered questions, and with Scar personally being a character I loved in this one and in the original anime, I was hoping his backstory would be more than two sentences given in the second to last episode that makes no real sense and removes all the magic from the series. It treats important issues like that, and like the Homunculi, the Philosopher's Stone, and like the Gate and Truth, and Father, especially, like it's just nothing, like they're not important, and after a certain point there's no mystery or any amount of credibility to any of these things because of the explanations they give that fail to really explain anything and because of how aware everyone in the world is to these things that are meant to hold an amount of mystery, thus making them interesting and having you want to get more out of the series.
If everyone knows about something that's supposed to be mysterious and taboo and mythical, then it's not mysterious and taboo and mythical.
There are too many characters to focus on and even in the last season they're adding more and more people it expects you to keep track of, and it's insane. One of the few comparisons I'll draw with the original 2003 anime is that while the story did have plot holes and was far from perfect, it was concise, consistent, and every character got development, rarely diverging from the central themes even in the filler episodes. Alphonse Elric, the protagonist's brother, feels like he isn't even a character. He is the protagonist's BROTHER. He has been there the /entire time/, his goddamn body was missing and he was a skilled alchemist like his brother, most of Edward's story has to DO with his brother, and he doesn't even feel like a character because he's barely in it and you only realize that he's not in it when you stop and ask where he is. There is a severe lack of character development in this series, treating major characters like they don't mean anything and treating minor characters like the world rests on their shoulders, like with May Chang, and another thing that worsens that is when there has been a massive amount of build up to something, it just doesn't even matter because, like I said, the payoff is nonexistent.
Father had such immense potential to be an amazing villain. You see him sitting there, around all these wires and tubes, looking like a figure from Biblical theology. His voice is strong, and commanding, and he's always sitting in that chair, and there's this intense feeling of mystery around him. He looks like Hohenheim, the protagonists' father, and you ask yourself, are they the same person? Did Hohenheim leave his kids to go create the Homunculi? Is it a split personality, or is it an illusion? Who could he be, and what? You then find out his backstory, along with Hohenheim's, in about eight minutes. You learn the history they share in eight minutes. Eight whole minutes to explain the backstory of the main antagonist and one of the primary characters in the show, who have both had massive build up to be these mysterious, powerful figures, and while the explanation they give is perhaps the best in the entire series, it all comes crashing down when, without giving major spoilers, everyone in Central knows who Father is, why he's there, what he's doing, and he ends up being a generic shounen villain who stops using alchemy and starts using magical powers. If everyone knows he's there, why he's there, and what he's doing, then he's not mysterious anymore, and it takes away all credibility the story has in that sense, and he was probably the most disappointing part of the entire series. He went from intriguing and mystifying and fearsome to Sephiroth and Anubis from the Yuugiou movie.
It stops being about alchemy. I mentioned that already, but I still can't get over that. If you wanted to make a show that focuses on corruption in the government and in the military, then just do that. Don't give it a unique fantasy setting only to not focus on that after a certain point, and especially don't have a fantasy setting that relies on scientific fact and the legitimate physics of that world, explained by science, end up being about magical powers and plaTE TECTONICS???????????? The military in the show is way too advanced for that time period, anyway, in terms of the techniques, strategies, and even the weapons they use, but that's minor and it doesn't even fucking matter after a certain point. Nothing matters after a certain point. The show is about alchemy, and that stops mattering after a certain point. It also has less to do with real-world alchemy than the original anime did, actually, and I find that interesting seeing as how the 2003 anime diverged relatively early on and made a vast amount of changes to the story and characters.
A homunculus, in terms of real-world alchemy, is a failed attempt at creating a human being. In the 2003 anime, a homunculus is a failed attempt at human transmutation. In Brotherhood, they don't tell you what it is. Ultimately, in the end, they don't tell you what a homunculus is. It mentions that the seven deadly sins are formed from Father's emotions, but that doesn't have any effect on anything and feels like it was just shoe-horned in, as does most things; and, like I said, if you've seen the series you know that those aren't the only Homunculi I mean. The deadly sins are also a Greek concept, as is alchemy, but in the original it feels that, universally, they have more to do with alchemy as a real science than they do in Brotherhood, which is supposed to be the ""real"" story. They even go more into the actual science behind alchemy in the original anime, and in Brotherhood their explanation is
plate tectonics. I guess.
There was the Gate, though, which was very loosely implied to have more to do with real alchemy, as each person who passes through the Gate has their own symbol on the door related to ideas presented by alchemists in the real world, which I actually had to look up on my own and I felt it would have definitely added to the story, but at that point I simply didn't care and at this point I just find it really cool. They never explain what the Gate is, or why it contains infinite alchemical knowledge, or why the Truth provides it for you. The Truth gets an explanation, though.
He's supposed to be God. Literal God, in a series where the main character is a vehement atheist and the theme of religion being a farce was made very clear in the first three goddamn episodes. Truth isn't Consciousness, or an idea of sorts. He's literally God, in a series where God isn't supposed to /exist/. Between you and me, I'd take Nazi Germany over that any day, because at least it's an explanation that makes more sense than ""it just exists, and it's controlled by God"".
There are things I liked more about this, though, than I did the original 2003 anime, to show that I don't think this whole thing is a complete crock of shit. Hohenheim, for example, is a much greater character. He's actually on my top list of favorite characters. It explores the world more, and Mustang and his entire crew are more likable in this one. Mustang and Riza are amazing together. I loved Wrath and Pride in this one a lot more than in the original. I liked the ideas of the Gate and of Truth, and I'm just going to pretend the last five episodes didn't happen. Scar was cooler in this one, and I loved Olivier.
What do I wish they would have done differently? Aside from the pacing, lack of focus and character development and reasonable explanations, as well as a lack of consistent themes, there were some things that I wish they would have changed to have more of an impact or to make it stand out more. I wish the Homunculi were more of a collective, because then it would have made more sense regarding their origin and Greed's defecting in both instances. I wish Father's base of operations were elsewhere, and I wish all of season five was just rewritten. It starts going into the plot again completely out of nowhere partway through an episode in the last season, and ugghhh I don't want to go into all of that. I wish the Gate and Truth were more explored, I wish the lands around Amestris were more explored, I wish that Pride and Wrath got even more development than they did. I wish Envy didn't turn into a giant six-legged green hair dog lizard thing with people on it. I wish May Chang wasn't even in it.
Overall, and in conclusion, I can best describe Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood as being a whole amalgamation of mystery and buildup only to have the writing in the story dismiss it with little explanation and by not addressing things that feel like they should matter. I still have a lot of unanswered questions, regarding Ishbal, Xerxes, and the dwarf in the flask. About Xing, about Drachma, about the fate of the Philosopher's Stone and about alchemy as a science. I have unanswered questions about the characters, and I'm never going to get any of those answers. Brotherhood was generic, disappointing, and while I'm aware this review isn't the best I could have written, I hope you found it useful.

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood surpasses the original series in almost every aspect imaginable. After I had finished watching the original FMA, I felt a endless sense of dissatisfaction, as the ending didn't sit right with me at all. 
I'll be honest, i put off watching Brotherhood for a very long time, as i didn't think that a lot of the series would have changed dramatically. I expected a bit of enhanced animation and the addition of a few characters. God. I couldn't be more wrong. The remake shines a new light onto the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, improving all of the imperfections and errors that were in
                  the original series.
The story line was healthy and straight to the point right from episode 1. No mucking about. As the plot goes on it gets hard to compare both series as the plot slowly drifts in difference directions from each other. What i was most enjoyed about was of-course, the ending. It was initiated perfectly, leaving no questions un-answered, which i feel was my main issue with Fullmetal Alchemist. It tied the entire show together neatly, the way it should have been.
The animation was beautiful. At times it was inconsistent, but even then it was great. Given that there is roughly a 6 year gap between the FMA and brotherhood, improved animation was a defiant. A lot more detail was provided though, which was a pleasant surprise.
Ah, now for the sound. Masafumi Mima deserves a medal, because he completely nailed this. I don't think there was a single OP or ED that i didn't enjoy. It matched the concept of Fullmetal Alchemist and scenes so well. There is nothing to say other than it was amazing.
The characters were developed a lot which was nice to see. It seemed there were at least a few episodes per main character to try to get to know them and deconstruct them as a character. This was a smart way to build the connection between viewer and character. Also bringing in a few new main characters that were not even mentioned in the original series was risky, but boy, it pull off. It gave a whole new feel to the show. With that being said, that squinty eyed guy sure knew how to annoy me at times.
Overall I am so glad i finally decided to watch Brotherhood. I ask for nothing else. I am more then content now hah. For everyone that has seen Fullmetal Alchemist and is thinking about watching Brotherhood but is worried it will be a waste of time because you think you already know what will happen. Go watch it, now. Stop reading this review and go watch it.",9
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a good show but to me it isn't as good as the original FMA.
The main reason for this statement is the 'changes' in the story. I know this series supposedly follows the manga but that's probably my problem. I've seen some shonen anime and the plot usually isn't the best thing about it, especially the ending. I liked the mysteries and the logic in the first FMA better.
I didn't watch all the episodes in one go because I thought the first 14 episodes were really bad. Up untill those episodes the story is the same as the original and they probably
                  rushed through it. Wasn't that part of the story 30 episodes long in FMA?
My third remark is the animation. I don't exactly know what's different ( I think they didn't use as many shadows) but the art seems worse, less dark which probably fits the shonen story better.
I can understand why a lot of people like this version of FMA better, it's probably because of the same reason why shonen anime are among the most popular, but I think some of the tragedy and consequences of equal trade that were present in the original FMA were lost in this series.",7
"
                Man, I was really late to the party on this one. Every time I saw polls on the best anime shows released, this would be usually top 5, maybe top 3. I remember hearing people talking about this when I was still in school, the type of people who didn't like anime telling me ""yeah, it's pretty good"". After about 6 years of hearing about it, and doubting it, I finally gave it a shot. Holy crap, why didn't I listen to everybody before?
I went into this knowing nothing about the premise, so the show itself had to tell me how everything worked and keep
                  me interested enough to last something like 64 episodes. 64?! My sweet spot is 26, anything beyond that are a commitment I'm not willing to make.
The first episode was one of the best pilots I think I've ever seen, it established so many world rules and characters and really showed off the budget and animation levels I was in store for. I remember thinking ""Woah, this really feels like Avatar: The Last Airbender"" and I grew up with that. As soon as I felt that, I knew I could last 64 episodes easy.
The show is relatively simple, there's a form of magic called alchemy that few possess, and there are large territories that are on very poor terms with one another. You're looking at great warriors and really detailed fight scenes. The real heart of this show is the strength of the characters, main and supporting, and the overall arcing story. It deals so well with escalation, never skipping too far ahead too fast as to lose you, but it keeps a quick pace with a lot of well explained mystery that you want to know more. Each section of the story adds foundations to the parts to come, previous pieces of intrigue combine to solve a larger piece of the puzzle. This feels so satisfying to watch, be it discovering the rules of alchemy to who the villain is and what his evil plan becomes.
This show can become beautifully dark, from familial deaths of main cast members, to examining how far someone will go for perfection, justice, or even life itself. The villains are wonderfully metaphorical, each being charismatic and deadly, while the heroes are very complex and quite human. Fullmetal really dissects human nature and shows you both the best and the worse of it. What pins this down is a really great soundtrack, the whole thing creates this sort of feeling that just flows into you. You name it, this show probably has it: political instability and invasions, insightful character development across the board, a good sense of humour to lighten the mood just enough that the shocking moments hurt so much worse, amazing fight choreography, a well written love story, mysterious secret societies, redemption arcs for desperate thugs...   It really has so much to offer, each piece well rounded and ready to be enjoyed. I don't know how they fit in so much without it feeling overly complicated or too stuffed, but they did!
I was an idiot for not checking out this show when people told me about it, because it really is a near perfect piece of entertainment across the board. By the end, I wanted more than 64 episodes, something I never imagined happening. I can't recommend this show more, it's unmissable.",10

                I love watching Anime since my Childhood and this one is my list of my TOP ANIME that i've ever watched. The Story is very unique that i can never expected the Scenes, What i love is their Sacrifices of the Characters not only the Protagonist but the Extra and even some of Antagonist here, The Enjoyment and Fun i experience here is unforgetable, I remember when i watch this Series ALONE while holding a Snacks. (This is what i'm doing everytime i watch Anime.)  I'm not expert in Animation but i think it is good. Thank you.

"
                Ehh...I loved the first Fullmetal Alchemist, but what I've seen so far of Brotherhood...sorry but I don't really like what they've done with the characters. The art style is...well, sort of like pokemon in my opinion and so not in a good way. I understand that some people might want the series to follow the manga a lot closer, but I thought it was fine the way it was in the original. I feel like they're doing more damage than good with this series.",5
"
                The art and action scenes are great. The writing is terrible and the ""expansion pack"" of characters (saying this having watched the 2003 anime) is annoying.
Some side characters are too dramatic and have more story than they need to, well other more important characters lack story and depth. With really got me with the comparison between a certain character's death scene. In the first anime he's happening slow motion and there are flashbacks, and another character sees them again, and it's powerful how this character effected the other characters. It's beautiful. It's art. I cry everytime. In the second anime that character just dies. The
                  others are affected by it, but it's not as meaningful.
I felt that way most of the events that went on. They were hardcore action, but they lacked emotion, and the lackluster writing really didn't help.",3
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a pretty beloved show on MAL and within the anime scene in general.  Personally, while I enjoyed it, I don't necessarily think it is the best thing since sliced bread.  It kept me entertained, and even at times made me feel an emotion or two, but the slow start and sometimes dragging plot didn't necessarily keep me thinking about watching the next episode when I was busy with other activities.  That being said, it is certainly worth a watch through at least once if you have the stomach for a 60+ episode series!  Let's get into the
                  breakdown.
Story (8/10) - I think the story was fairly well done.  It wasn't groundbreaking and it didn't necessarily have a lot of ""oh snap!"" moments, but it executed quite well.  Its exposition was usually laser focused on the characters and history that mattered, the plot was consistently moved forward to the inevitable conclusion, and you did get a sense of something grander going on.  It didn't waste your time with a ton of filler, and you could see this spiderweb of deception in every corner of the world.  The events were logical, believable, and often relateable despite being set in a fantastical world of magic, with problems often mirroring very real life scenarios.
It also handled flashbacks remarkably well I think.  Many shows just drag flashbacks on and on.  FMA:B kept them quick and relevant.  It actually made me enjoy them and made me curious about the backstory rather than beating me over the head with historical exposition to justify everything.  My only real complaint with the story was how it dragged at the beginning while it was setting up the spider-webbing for the over-arching grand scheme.  It took nearly 20 episodes to get going, but once it did get going, it took off at a brisk run.  It was a significant enough annoyance to me though that I can't give the story a 9 despite its pretty quality execution.
Art (7/10) - The art was certainly above average, but it didn't really stand out in any particular way to me.  It was consistently solid, with no mistakes, but not beautiful.  It served its purpose and allowed you to immerse yourself in the world, but was short of being truly captivating.  There were definitely brief moments where it came close to being stunning though, and I have to give credit for the very eye-catching design of Pride (hah, I made a funny!).
Sound (5/10) - I think the sound for this show was its weakest quality.  It felt to me like it was merely adequate.  It served its purpose, but nothing really was memorable to me from the soundtrack to the voicing.  My personal taste may be heavily colouring my opinion here, but I really just found the sound as action-average as any J-Pop intro to a RomCom or Ecchi.
Characters (8/10) - Along with the story, the characters were quite well handled.  They were all very standard stereotypes, but each had their own unique quirks and motivations to keep them interesting.  I wouldn't say any were particularly deep, but there were certainly moments where I would feel for a couple characters.  I enjoyed learning about all their backstories, and I enjoyed that they all walked their own paths, or at least tried to until they were often drawn back together by fate.  Their independence was actually relateable instead of the usual excessive aloofness of ""independent"" characters in many other shows.  They genuinely felt like individuals rather than cogs in a big machine.
Enjoyment (7/10) - At my first foray into this series, I honestly have to say I was pretty ""meh"" about it.  Up until about episode 18 for me, the story dragged along as it tried to set everything up and introduce all the main players.  It sagged under the weight of it and I often found myself thinking of other things I could be doing while watching.   It was still enjoyable... just not really compelling.  Starting out this was a 5/10 for me.  After episode 18 though, the show finally kicked it into gear and I found my enjoyment increased *measurably*.  Middle of the show it was a 6/10 and by the end it landed a 7.  It's worth watching if you can make it to the end, especially considering the pleasant and fulfilling ending that so many action anime lack these days.  If I was my younger self, I could see myself having enjoyed it even more.  I can't say I'll rewatch it, by I'm certainly glad I've seen it.
So overall I give ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" a 7/10.  It was almost an 8, but not quite.  Not because it did anything wrong, but more that it didn't try to push itself at all and stayed in its comfort-zone.  The story was interesting enough though and the characters did often elicit some compassion from me.  If you're reading this to figure out if you should watch this show, then sure, you'll probably find something in it worth your time (as long as you are good with 60+ episodes), but be careful not to go into it with too much hype in mind.",7

                this is a staple for anime, in one word, its original.
STORY - 10
unpredictable in a lot of important plot moments, a very smart but not complex narrative and an overall well thought story from beginning to end.
ART - 9
When a start watching this series ithougt it didnt look that great, i even think the original series looked better, but with time i just adapted to the look, animation wise is actually really cool, any scene with King Bradley fighting is a 10/10 scene fot sure.
Sound - 10
I love the expresion in the voices, the sounds and the music of the series, the openings of the
                  first series are more memorable, but FMA-B has quite good openings too, especially the first one.
Character - 10
For this time, the characters are kinda cliche, but that doesnt make them uniterestings, almost every character in this series is very memorable, maybe you could forget their names but you can remember the things they do for the plot, if a series is capable of giving a lot of characters and make them very unique from one to another, that series deserve a 10/10 for that.
There is a lot of comedy relief from all the characters, even in the most serious situation vbut that doesnt ruin the immersion
ENJOYMET - 10
its my favourite series of all anime, none of the episode is boring, and each one of them give something important, character development, clues for the plot, good exposition, moral values questioning and plot development
OVERALL - 10
Its a must watch fot everyone that like anime, and is a good watch for people that dont like anyme or havent tried.
Its just a masterpiece in all fronts, and nothing can compare to it",10

                Masterful story with amazing pacing. Deep characters done with wonderful voice acting that truly sets the emotion of every episode. Art is beautiful and very thematic, portraying the 1900s British/German setting perfectly. Music is lovely, with many epic soundtracks that make fights very truly epic, as well as tracks during emotional moments or important shifts in plot. Almost every episode leaves you hanging and begging for more, and if you truly pay attention, you will be very impressed at how wonderfully paced it is. The content is very powerful, portraying many ideas and problems about society. Every  scene is choreographed very well, using the
                  ideas and philosophies that were portrayed and twisting them and giving even more meaning then they already have. An example of this would be in episode 8:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9m5R2mhlBE
Skip to 16:00 and watch from there and it should be very clear how the idea of the two brothers being human is quickly twisted into something more malevolent. The ending is very satisfying as it gives complete restoration and closure. Overall I enjoyed every minute of this anime and am confident in the rating I have given it. A must watch for anime mature anime fan, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a powerful anime with wonderful story that will have you at the edge of your seat until the very end.
10/10 Perfect",10

                This is my all-time favourite anime, and most likely will forever stay that way. The protagonist Edward Elric is my all-time favourite anime character, he has such a deeply tragic backstory alongside his brother Alphonse, which got me really invested in him right away, he grows and and develops so much as a character throughout the course of the show, has such an entertaining and funny personality which doesn't make him look bland at any point, shares such incredibly strong character dynamics which several other important characters in the show the suffering and pain he endures throughout which makes his final happy and fulfilled ending
                  incredibly satisfactory narrative wise. The show as a whole has such an amazingly compact storytelling, such a grand cast consisting of a wide range of wonderfully written characters in terms of characterization, great world building which is evident by how plot thickens and thickens towards as the story reaches its end, resulting in an epic, memorable and satisfactory climax which gives a proper closure to the story and the characters. The show via the rule of ""Equivalent Exchange"" actually heavily explores the fundamentals of karmic justice, which makes everything that happens feel grounded in morality. No other show has made me so deeply feel and care for the characters even again, I can give this a 1000/10 if I could. :)",10

                I recently finished watching this after seeing it at the top of the charts and learning that it had been at the top for a while. I can't say I'm surprised at this. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, or FMA:B, exceeded the expectations that I had for it.
Story: 10/10
This is probably the thing that FMA:B does the best. The plot is engaging, and progresses at a reasonable pace. I have seen many people saying that this anime does not do a good job adapting the beginning of the manga with the first 14 or so episodes, but as a person who has not read the manga, I
                  think that the first 14 episodes are still very good. They are completely outshined by the remaining 50 episodes, but nonetheless still enjoyable. When it comes to the pacing, I also appreciate that this anime focuses more on the plot than on the fights, like how many other popular shounen like Naruto do. When the pace of the fights gets to Naruto levels, despite how good the story may be, it can feel unbearable to me at times to keep watching. The plot twists are reveals in Brotherhood are also executed quite impressively.
Art: 8/10
FMA:B's art/animation isn't bad, but it's not what brought it to the top of the charts either. In the first few episodes, it looked a little bit lackluster. I don't know if this is just because the technology in 2009 wasn't as good, they didn't work as hard here because they already did with the 2003 adaptation, or simply that I got used to it. Regardless, later on, the show's animation does look to generally improve, and when it tries to, it can look CLEAN, especially in some scenes when Roy Mustang goes ham. 
Sound: 7/10
I didn't pay conscious attention to FMA:B's sound effects, but I never thought anything sounded off while watching this. I watched and recommend the dub because it fits the setting better than Japanese speech. Seriously, these characters have the whitest names ever. Also, the Amestrian characters' writing is done in English. The cast of the dub voices do a fantastic job. The only minor complaint I have is that initially, Edward's English voice is a bit grating and can take a second to get used to. But in the comedic scenes, his voice is excellent. I love all of the OPs and EDs in this anime, But I do have to point out a flaw with the OST. First off, it's not outstanding like a Hiroyuki Sawano work. More importantly, some of the tracks just don't fit the setting. FMA:B takes place in what seems to be based on Europe in the early 20th century, but some of the soundtrack sounds like music from the medieval period. If I listened to some of this music without knowing what anime it's from, I'd assume it's from something like Seven Deadly Sins.
Character: 10/10
FMA:B has one of my favorite casts of characters, and in my opinion is only surpassed by one other anime that I have seen. There's not much for me to say here, but I liked every character and I had trouble picking a favorite. Edward is an amazing shounen protagonist, but my favorite character is Scar, who I think is criminally underrated. The Homunculi, especially Wrath, are fantastic villains.
Enjoyment: 9/10
The only issue I had that halted my enjoyment for a second was that in the middle of the story, all of the characters start going to and being in different places, and it can become difficult to remember who is where and why. But even without knowing the details at the moment, I still enjoy the hell out of FMA:B. These episodes could spend an opening minute or two on some recap, but the Internet and a quick Google search could take care of this problem anyway. Other than this, I have no gripes.
Overall: 9/10
Perfection doesn't exist, but FMA: Brotherhood does come pretty close. That doesn't mean it's the best anime, or even that it's my favorite. What I mean is that there is something in this that can be enjoyed by everyone. The plot is engaging, the characters are all likeable and/or relatable, there are fights but not enough to destroy the show's pacing, there is not too much violence or gore, there are cute ships and hints of romance, there are minimal amounts of fanservice if any, there is clean art/fluid animation, and there is good music. I strongly recommend watching Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood if you haven't already.
Thanks for reading my first ever MAL review!",10
"
                The adaptation of manga, intead of original work. Shame really. The second part fails to capture awesomness of first part opting to do everything as differently as possible from first part. Which is a shame - charecter development is just poor (and some charecters such as Mustang are just boring opposing the brilliant and loved Mustang from first part), the speed of story doesn't leave any time for good plot, idiotic deforming of animation, poor animation in general (despite huge budjet), good OST, that nevertheless fails to shine in comparison to first part and most importantly it fails to use brilliant findings of original anime
                  (such as comparison of Winry-Ed's mother with ligh shining through the hills). The originally very touching story of two brothers became just a humorous story. No drama, crying, cruelty of the world, no life-problem questions, no interesting and philosophical monologues, etc
Very many points where it could do better, but doesn't. Insted of formula ""excelent manga + ecelent anime prequel"" we only get so-so mainstream anime. 
Though with soon to depart original series story it could still be prooved to be good anime. However, after dissapointing Soul Eater and Xam'd faith into Bones is very weak.",6
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood ? Overrated ? Absolutely not. Watching this whole series, i was thirsty, thirsty for more enjoyment, humor and character development  each time i finish an episode. Definitely worth watching. The older series, Fullmetal Alchemist is a good anime, so i had high expectations for Brotherhood. The story line of these two series are slightly different but the plot remains the same. The shocking but amazing plot twists got me taken aback and sitting on the edge of my seat to see what else is coming. 
I laughed, I cried, I cheered. 
I also learned valuable lessons.
About loving someone unconditionally even
                  if you have to give up something that means the world to you, or even risking your life to the verge of death. Edward and Alphonse, the brothers, love each other to the moon and back, and even when their love reach the moon, it will come back to earth and keep itself alive. 
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood makes you question about the life they chose, about lust, wrath, sloth, pride, gluttony, greed and envy. 
How does it feels to lose someone ? To sacrifice everything ? To watch the one you love lives in the whirlpool of despair? The answers lie within their beating hearts.
Do i regret watching Brotherhood ? Yes because i ended up sleeping late every single night due to the undying excitement and no, simply because, it kills hours of my time watching this with love and enjoyment. 
If i have to choose which one of the Elric brothers that i love the most, i will have to ponder over it for a long time, and i even might not get to choose. 
Both of these characters equally contribute to the storyline. None takes the spotlight from the other. Both would sacrifice themselves, both would bear the pain for others' happiness, and both touched the hearts of people around them through their journey. 
It is possible to love so many characters in one anime at once, at least that's how i feel towards them.
Whether you like this anime or hate it, the choice is yours, but, this critically acclaimed series will slowly devour your heart and grows within you, and it feels good.",10
"
                I started Brotherhood after I  finished fma 2003, so not surprisingly I thought this version was... well, it was lighter, I guess? Yes, it was also shounen too. But that didnt bother me very much, after all I'm a sucker for action. But character development was different compared to the 2003 version, or so it seems to me. It is good that ed and al didnt even think about harming another soul till the very end, but after all they've been through, I thought they would at least put some thought in it, if it made sense. Like they did in 2003. I understand
                  people think brotherhood is canon and characters in the 2003 version is OOC, but I just thought 2003 was a little bit more realistic in some ways. Regardless I fell in love with both of them :)",9
"
                To start off, i should clarify that the original FMA is one of my favourite anime's, so to say that brotherhood 'tops it' is not a simple statement be me. 
At first i was actually reluctant to watch brotherhood simply because i felt they were down playing how good original was. So pure stubbiness kept this wonderful experience from me, but could you blame me? There was a lot of hype about brotherhood, and to me the selling point was that it was a different ending to the same story i loved, but i later released that is far too understated of what the differences
                  really are.
So i finally decided to watch it after a saw the first episode on t.v. and i agreed it was a much better looking anime than original and the fact that it was still the same characters i loved, so why not see the difference. So off i went and ask my older brother for his copy.
Once it started i noticed immediately this anime was created for the original fan base and not an alternative to original, which ups its appeal for me. All the beginning story lines are fast passed so u don't feel your just sitting through original again, plus there are surprising changes(which i shall not spoil); so if u haven't seen original it can be a bit full on and ""a lot of info in a short time"" (as my friend who i showed brotherhood too, who hadn't seen original said) but its not impossible. i still maintain to this day too see both!
Anyway, as the story progresses and you feel all secure knowing what's happening and (u think) you know where this is all going, until BANG! CURVE BALL, and suddenly your whisked away onto a totally amazing story completely different to original. These anime's stand alone! So it doesn't really matter which u start with or if u choose to just watch one (which is a same), but this said Brotherhood is better. And here's why:
Well for one big point : Winry.
HOLY CRAP that annoyed me in original, and my brothers can vogue that my first sentence once the movie that finishes original's story ends i seriously was like ""Ummmm wtf about Winry?! They seriously (spoiler)  just leave her!!"" and i think i cried but that doesn't matter.... 
In brotherhood not only do u see a lot more of Winry, you get a BACK STORY, AND DEVELOPMENT! HOLLY SHIT! And its very good. In original it was always left up to inturprritaion as too what Winry was to the Elric brothers, but now we get to see her story pan out and its supper well done.^_^. 
Another reason as to why Brotherhood is better than original is : The GATE/GOD/THINGY
This part of the anime makes so much more sense and doesn't make me want to brake open my skull and pull out my brain. That's not saying original did amazing with what they had, i just think brotherhood doesn't stretch belief as unbelievably. 
Also the previous fact leads to my last reason : THE MOTHER FUCKING BEST.ENDING.EVER!
When original ended there was no sense of happily ever after. It just left off (spoiler) with that sense of the unknown, a guaranty that the story wasn't in fact over and a great big SQUID! ALL THAT SUFFERING AND THAT GREAT BIG, LONG JOURNEY AND YOU DON'T GET ANY RESOLUTION! That always bugged me but i could forgive original cause the journey was in fact amazing and i really love the beginning. But with Brotherhood, there was none of that. You know exactly were the characters stand at the end and everything is tied up with a beautiful bow! (SPOILER, not to mention babies!!! So cutttteeeeee! XD )
So now that i've said all this before you watch brotherhood, i still suggest watching original first. I am one of though's people who saves the best parts of her food for last, or how i really think about it, end on the best flavour :) 
Original is longer too, so i feel you really can bound with the characters before starting Brotherhood, which makes the ending all the more satisfying! 
(You don't have to by any means, i just think its the best way to experience FMA)
So here's my rating for this anime:
Story: 10/10 a wonderful beginning, middle and end. Plus it flows organically, and you're never bored. 
Art: 9/10 Fluid, better defined colours and breath taking action. All the characters look better",9

                This is a short review of Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. I have seen many of the episodes, but not all of them in order and do not consider this a proper judgement of the series.
Story - 4: The story of Full Metal Alchemist is supposed to be about two tragic brothers going to search for the Philosopher's Stone that their father disappeared looking for. The laws of equivalent exchange are supposed to be really gruesome. Going out into the world and making discoveries is something really important to the Elric brothers. This impression was what made me love Full Metal Alchemist in the 2003 version.
                  In Brotherhood, you do not get a big sense of any of this happening with the main characters because the first episodes that deal with these issues are terrible. They did this to save time, but it does not make sense considering that the beginning of an adventure is always the most important part to immersing yourself in the world.
Oddly enough, the majority of Brotherhood is based in creating its world while it somehow feels like just adding China to the equation made it a lot bigger. The oriental theme always feels disconnected from world-building and this was the same with Brotherhood even though it was detailed greatly and central to our two Asian characters. Ling was almost a decent character. It is definitely easy to like him, but his rather flat and plain character was simply hidden behind emotional storytelling cliches.
War seems far too encompassing in the story. It seems too mundane compared to what we should expect with alchemy. There are so few alchemy users that it is ridiculous and they do not know how to use their alchemy in new ways most of the time.
Toward the final battles of the series, everyone seems shallow and it would have been fine for most of the characters to die.
Art - 5: The art is good mainly because it is grounded in proper details and good lighting and such. The colors are done almost true to reality, which they were going for. The characters usually do not take up as much of the screen as your average anime and I felt that it was both effective and alienating. At worst, the environments are a bunch of empty, hallway-like rooms and darkness in much of the later parts of the anime. Cannon firing is over-used to make things look exciting. Expositions and waiting scenes are very common to allow for more cheaper art.
There is also the stupid rectangle effect with things getting obliterated or disappearing. It is quite detailed, but also not effective to conveying anything. Another annoying effect is Edward's alchemy, which is always spraying electricity and gray pillars rising out of the ground.
With the openings, the art was always annoyingly cliche-looking and it did not vary between seasons. Not only were they animated in an annoying or stereotypical way, but they conceptually did not form any good themes. 
The first ending almost worked. The drawings were done nicely, but it thematically was pretty stupid to show as a children's drawing because no kid would think to draw these things except the Megaman-esque platform jumping part. The other endings were drawn very annoyingly, much more so than the openings.
Sound - 4: People love stupid orchestral music. A lot of this music was made to stay in the background and it sounds very dull and monochromatic. I honestly thought that there might have been only 6 songs. There actually are probably six songs they reuse in every episode because I remember getting really annoyed at hearing a few songs that were supposed to be sinister, but just sounded idiotically simple. The music department was just bare bones.
When it comes to the openings and endings, some of them could be considered the worst of all anime, but nobody would admit that. They all sound like Bleach or Naruto songs, but without half as many strong points. Anyway, 
As for the sound effects, they are rather comprehensive. I would have rated the sound a 2 if the sound effects were just average, but they are definitely a step above almost any anime out there.
Character - 4: The characters are not explored enough to give you a sense of attachment. It feels like the war is the entire story most of the time. However, the developed characters are amazing. The villains are pretty terrible. This new (or orignail) rendition of Scar was one of the few awful protagonists compared to the 2003 anime. There is also Alphonse, who supposed to made deeper just because he finds a love interest. And, Edward is just a hopeless character. He has the same personality almost the whole time despite any supposed developments. This is mainly because the comedy feels like the only time Al and Ed could have shown what their personalities are, but everyone knows how bad the comedy is here. They are simply mired in conflict after conflict without being able to loosen up in a genuine way.
All of the sins are pretty bad, even Greed and Envy who get the most development. They pretty much fight and do not represent themselves with their simple to write personality traits. All that defines them as characters is combat skills and maybe some grief over what they have been doing. The Father is without character except in his background. He is pretty much a stereotypical bad guy. The somewhat tragic past of Alphonse and Edward seems to be the only thing that is supposed to carry deep negative emotion in this show, and they blew that part of the story off.
The voice actors are mismatched, making characters sound too stereotypical or too gruff (the Colonel definitely sounds too gruff) or just stupid (Lang and Greed to name two). However, I am basing it on an English dub and it is hard to really judge on voice acting because the Japanese could be loads better.
Enjoyment - 7: Despite many, many faults, it is possible to get engaged in this show and love it to some extent. Unlike other shows where you might compromise your beliefs and see bad aspects as good, you are prone to gloss over the bad aspects of this show because it is very enjoyable at times. As mentioned earlier, the storytelling can beat out the bland characters, which is very much like a movie. Despite the anime openings being weak and extremely generic, they are action-packed enough that you will be bound to enjoy them.
However, there is still the terrible comedy which always falls flat (and would even without so much repetition of the same junk). There are still lengthy scenes that seem to be going over the same details again or showing seemingly the same scenes you saw in other flashbacks and expositions. 
Overall - 5: I wish it could be lower considering how annoyed I was by this show.",5

                Cartoon Network isn’t what it used to be. As a kid, I watched CN because it had shows that appealed to tons of people, shows that had meaning, and shows that deserved to be labeled classics. Those shows are gone. Teen Titans, Samurai Jack, The Batman, Chowder, Kids Next Door, and more have been dismissed for garbage cartoons like Teen Titans Go! , Adventure Time, Ninjago, and Uncle Grandpa (No comment on those new Pokémon incarnations). With the exception of Clarence and Steven Universe, Cartoon Network is a joke. CN’s lone redeeming factor is Toonami, a late-night segment form Saturday evening to Sunday morning where
                  various anime are featured, and one of them used to be Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
I never liked Brotherhood; I love it. An avid reader of the FMA manga, I stumbled upon Brotherhood on Toonami and, form there, I was hooked. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who lose possession of their bodies as a result of breaking the most important rule in alchemy, attempting to resurrect the dead, and they journey across the country of Amestria as they attempt to reclaim their former selves. Edward Elric is this anime’s protagonist, the famed “Fullmetal Alchemist” whose legendary reputation is rivaled by his alchemical skills, the wise cracking prodigy with an unpredictable personality and a strong distaste for milk, and the height-conscious adolescent with a constant inner conflict about morality, a massive amount of confidence, and an unwavering dedication to his loved ones. If I were to make a list of the greatest anime characters, Edward Elric would be in at least the top ten. Alphonse Elric is the younger of the two brothers, a gentle and likable young boy trapped in a suit of armor that serves as Edward’s mediator during Ed’s explosive episodes (Al is often assumed to be the older of the two due to his height). Brotherhood ventures into a variety of places throughout Amestria, from the bustling business environment in Central City to the fear-inducing tunnels underneath the city, from the wind-driven snowflakes covering the Drachma region to the primal adobes in dust-consumed Ishval, and, in all of them, this anime crafts the setting with a razor-sharp eye for detail and an amazingly artistic flair.
The majority of FMA Brotherhood doesn’t focus on the Elric brothers but instead on the people surrounding them. Colonel Roy Mustang is my favorite character, an easygoing alchemist with the coolest power ever (He can unleash fire by – get this! – snapping his fingers!), and an ambitious leader that alternates between cracking jokes and being dangerously serious. There’s Winry Rockbell, a childhood friend of the Elric brothers and a gifted mechanic. There’s Scar, a sunglasses-wearing Ishvalan with a reputation as a malicious murderer and a mission to destroy alchemists of the military via alchemy. Brotherhood also contains a great group of villains in the Homunculi, the seven nearly-unstoppable immortal-like beings each with their own unique personality, and their Father. The two Homunculi that stood out to me were Greed (The Homunculi are named after the seven deadly sins), a rebellious man with steel-like skin, and Pride. Born from Nightmare Fuel, Pride is this anime’s most important villain excluding the main antagonist Father who I will remember most for that frightening scene with Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye. Excluding the emotionless Father, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has characters with great acting, emotion, complexity, and (above all) likability (Is this even a word?)
There are five main themes in Brotherhood; the final opening is by far the most emotional, but my favorite is the first, a fast-paced theme song that slowly intensifies at a pace with the opening’s singer. Plotwise, there isn’t a big difference in Brotherhood from the Fullmetal manga (although Isaac the Freezer never graced the FMA pages nor did Father Cornello evolve into a hulking beast), but the anime is still just as good, with more twists than a Twizzler stick and more energy than a kid on a sugar rush.
Perhaps the greatest thing about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is its appeal to all genres. If you want tons of action, if you want a show with martial arts, if you want a military-themed anime, if you want some mystery to your show, if you want some sci-fi in your show, if you want a huge focus on adventure in your show, if you want some slice-of-life aspects to your anime, if you want to see buckets of blood, if you want to watch a show with fantasy elements in it, if you want to watch a dystopia-themed show, if you want to check out an anime with depth, then Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the series for you.",10
"
                Well, this is my first review so please tell me if you found this helpful or not so I can do a better one the next time :)
I heard about Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood from a friend of mine and I really postponed watching this show... At this moment I feel like an idiot. This show was a masterpiece in all the directions it could and after finishing it I was completely astonished !
Story (10/10) 
OK, at the first 2 or 3 episodes I was a bit confused and couldn't understand some things, but at the fourth episode I started to get what this amazing anime
                  was about.
As it is said on the synopsis, it is about the Elric brothers trying to get back their bodies, after commiting the taboo of alchemy, trying to revive the dead using it. After failing and paying a heavy bill for even trying, with the older brother, Edward, losing limbs and the younger one, Alphonse, losing all his body, only for Edward to affix his soul into an armor, the story begins as Edward Elric, the older brother, becomes a State Alchemist, one who uses his alchemy for the military, in order to have a better chance of recovering their bodies. In the 3rd episode it's revealed that they are searching for the legendary Philosopher's Stone, wich is used for ignoring the basic rule of alchemy, the equivalent exchange. 
Now let me tell you that this isn't the real story behind Fullmetal Alchemist. The recover of their bodies comes at the second place of this anime, cause there are some more important things to take care first... the safety of the world for example...
This was a more detailed synopsis and a better one I think. 
Now let's move on to what I liked about the story. It is really a mind-blowing one, as the events that happened before the story started are mixed with the actual story. That combination will completely shock everybody. There are a few very important characters, everyone with his own story, amazingly explained and included in only one amazing storyline. The Elric brothers story, the Ishbal's Civil War story and the very dark story behind some unthinkable things will amaze you, but not only these, as there are some other very positive things about the story:
- The plot and it's develop is uncomparable to any another anime I've seen;
- It is very unpredictable and will surprise you every now and then;
- It has some unforgettable funny moments, although being quite a dark anime
- It has some very dramatic moments that will stay in your mind for a good amount of time;
- The battles are fantastic, very strategic and enjoyable.
But there is also a negative side. Due to the rushed start, a death of somebody at the first 10 episodes that is a turning point in the story, didn't look that dramatic as it should have looked, but at the latter stages of the show, you'll understand the significance of that person's death.
At a certain point I thought that the end of this anime would ruin all, like Naruto's one, when that happy, unrealistic ending destroyed it. Luckily I was wrong, as the end not even was unfrogettable, but also at that point of the story nothing came for cheap.
Overrall, the story is really amazing and worth a big 10.
Art (10/10)
As a newly made anime, unlike the version of 2003, the art is breathtaking. There is a memorable animation quality, that we even now, in 2015, do not often see. The animation in the fight scenes is amazing and very fluid. 
The character's design is very good too, as they are completely different from each-other. 
I think 'Bones' has turned this anime into a piece of art. Even the details of every character, that I greatly observe, are just fascinating.
The colours are great too, as I enjoyed very much the contrast between the bright and dark colours.
Sound (9/10)
To start with, I watched the subbed version, as I enjoy very much the japanese language. I didn' regret my choice.
The character's voices and their intonation was really class. This was largely due to the elite actors they hired for doing this job. But even the ones that want a dubbed version won't have problems, cause I happened to watch one episode in the dubbed version and it was nearly as good as the subbed version.
The first three openings were very addictive and I quite liked them. The other 2 openings were good too. The endings were great too, especially the fourth one.
As for the OST, there were some really fantastic ones for the tense, anxious and fight moments. Even the quiter ones were good and were played at the right moments.
The only problem is that there is a lack of character's theme, even if there are some kind of instrumental music. That's the only reason that I'll give it a 9.
Character (10/10)
The characters of this anime are all very interesting and entertaining and they all have a bond with each-other in some way. They all have different powers as well as their own ambitions and to not forget, a dark past...
As we know the protagonists are the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric. Edward, also known as the Fullmetal Alchemist, or also as the youngest State Alchemist at only 15. He is stubborn, strong willed guy, leading the Führer President, the highest ranked person of the country, to code-name him Fullmetal. Alphonse Elric, the youngest brother, has a more calm and kind-hearted character than his brother. 
But this show wouldn't have been a masterpiece if there weren't some absolutely cool guys supporting them. I will write down some characters that are worth watching with details:
- Colonel Roy Mustang, Edward's superior at the military, is a cool,  a bit arrogant (like Fullmetal) and good-looking guy, whose ambition is to become the Führer President. He is presumably the strongest State Alchemist. In addition, he has some amazing, very reliable and funny subordinates, who make this show a damn comedy at times with the way they do things. Man, that's what I call teamwork! You should definitely take a good look at them. Roy also cares very much for his subordinates and protects them with everything he can. Have a good look at Maes Hughes, Riza Hawkeye and his other subordinates cause you're going to love them. 
- The Elric's brothers father, Van Hohenheim, abandoned his family when his kids were at a very young age. In the first episodes when he makes short appearances, he looks like a cold guy, but it turns out to be different, even though he has a very dark secret in his heart...
- Mey Chang and Ling Yao have comed from the East in order to obtain the secret of immortality for their Emperor with the sole purpose of gaining his trust and saving their clans. Mey Chang and Ling Yao are enemies and their battle for gaining the secret is worth a good watching.
- Solf J. Kimblee is a hero of the Ishbalan Extermination Civil War and on the first episodes frequently makes short appearences in a prison, with wood handcuffs and with two transmutation circles in his hands. Well, what can I say, he is a complete psychopath, but I really liked how the heck he acted during the show. Did I forget to tell you that he was prisoned cause he refused to give the army a Philosopher's Stone they gave him to exterminate the Ishbalans and that he ate it? Oh yes I forgot, sorry.
- The antagonists in this show are all really badass, all immortal, very strong and part of the same ""group"". In that ""group"" are also 2 characters that I was completely shocked . That's as far as I'm allowed to tell you without spoiling everything, but they also have a very dark story and a very strange and sometimes confusing past.
The character's development makes this anime even better than first thought. Again a big 10.
Enjoyment (10/10) 
I enjoyed this anime from the start till the end in the same manner. If you don't like it at the first few episodes don't drop it, just give it more time, cause I'm sure you'll love it.
It is very important to watch all the details carefully, cause it can confuse you sometimes if you don't watch it properly. Furthermore, it starts giving you clues of what's going on behind the scenes from the first episode !!
Well, what can I say, I love this anime, so the enjoyment is 10.
Overall (10/10)
As I said, I was a bit suspicious about this anime at the start, but I think I did the best thing when I started it. It's absolutely a fantastic anime that I'm sure everybody will enjoy !
Thank you for reading this review and I'm going to finish it with a quote from the protagonist, Edward Elric:
""A lesson without pain is meaningless. That's because no one can gain without sacrificing something. But by enduring that pain and overcoming it, one shall obtain a powerful, unmatched heart. A FULLMETAL HEART.""",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood took all the impressive qualities from the first series and simply polished them. In the process of doing so, it practically eliminated all weaknesses from the first series and created a true work of art. The misplaced comedy was removed. Nearly no scenes which are intended to be dramatic are accompanied by slapstick humor. Brotherhood‘s visuals are of a considerably higher caliber and so are its action scenes. What truly separates FMA: Brotherhood from its original counterpart however is the way in which it explores profound philosophical themes. The level of depth in Brotherhood‘s story is astounding. It avoids any form of
                  fillers, unlike the original, and uses every single one of its episodes effectively. Take any episode out of FMA: Brotherhood and it will be missing a vital organ in its body.",10
"
                What makes a show a masterpiece? How enjoyable it is? Lots of character development? A complex and interesting plot? Lots of symbolism and themes? Or maybe it's just based on the shows own hype and popularity? Well, it doesn't matter which it is because Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) has it all. As probably everyone knows, FMAB is a remake of the original Full Metal Alchemist (2003) series; A remake that does pretty much everything right and makes an already great series into one of the greatest series ever. For those of you who have not seen Brotherhood, it is not a ""sequel"" or copy
                  of the original, it's an alternate continuity that follows the manga more accurately than the original (original was created before manga was finished). This show is a must-watch to everyone, all ages and let me tell you why:
I don't want to get too much into the plot since it'd be useless reading since you're going to watch this masterpiece and find out about it's story anyways. The story follows 2 young brothers, Ed and Alphonse Elric, and their struggles in achieving their personal quest.  Edward and Al Elric attempted unsuccessfully to revive their mother using the power of alchemy. In the failure process, the elder brother, Ed, loses a leg, and the younger brother, Al, loses his entire body. Ed manages to attach his brother's soul to a nearby suit of armor, at the cost of his right arm. In the midst of their quest, there are political and military conflicts alongside the darkness of human nature (pandora's box stuff). Greed? Lust? Envy? Gluttony? Truth/Lies? All aspects of our reality that people have to overcome, and FMAB portrays it perfectly. 
The plot isn't complicated and symbolic at all yet it gives off the sense of an absolutely genius masterpiece. The show is ""mere"" 64 episodes (not enough for me). Because the show was so long, it had the opportunity to develop their plot to it's fullest potential, and oh boy do they deliver. 64 episodes, and there were absolutely no filler episodes where I was left bored. Skip parts of the show? Unthinkable. Brotherhood does a exceptional job of pacing itself into laying out the foundations of the story as a collection of pieces, and then connecting them all together throughout the series to create a cohesive, masterfully intertwined, and satisfying (tragic) ending. Starting with the very heritage of the main characters and the conspiracy behind the very formation of Amestris. Then the characters figuring out the ""truth"", having to deal with painful experiences, accepting reality/fate, and really growing as a human being. Then portraying the potential and corruption of human beings. With constant sensational battles both psychological and upfront confrontation to keep the viewers entertained... To the very ending where all the questions from the beginning/middle are answered, and the viewers are taught a valuable lesson about humanity-growing up and reality-not as dream-like as we'd like to believe as kids. Epic, Touching/Tragic, Funny, Magical, Simply Amazing. 
Greatest vast cast of characters in anime, period. There should be no debate. The main characters aren't given all the screen-time like other shows. FMAB shows the perspectives of so many characters (10+ maybe around 20? Yep--Amazing). What really touched me was that Ed and Al remained true to themselves until the very end. They don't change or learn anything that fundamentally changes them like most ""heroic characters"" They were originally innocent kids who made mistakes just like all human beings. Then they went on the journey to try and correct their mistakes, and through their journey, they learn that there are more things wrong with the world than their own follies; and to repent upon your sins in reality is something of an ambiguous thing... An interesting thing to look for is that although the Elric brothers are on their journey to find the philosopher stone and regain their body, they constantly give up on their quest for the sake of others, to help others, and that, is the true definition of heroism. The other characters aren't there to aid or prevent the Elric brothers achieve their goal, they're there with their own stories. Random characters meet together, and build friendship? Betray eachother/Fall in love? No. FMAB isn't childish like that. But of course, all of the character's pasts and stories all intertwine with one another as the show progresses in a ingeniously woven manner, which eventually leads up to an ideal conclusion that the viewers have no choice to be dazzled by. Every single character is memorable, relatable, and just so damn realistically portrayed with each to their own humanistic feelings. All of them are entertaining to watch as they development and everyone has a moment of truth, where they shine more brightly than the other characters; no one character is like ""the overpowered great heroic guy"" or ""the primary evil psychopathic villain"". To name a few characters that had their own story, had a ton of screen-time, and were highly enjoyable to watch: Roy Mustang (Such a heroic, respectable character, one of best characters ever), Riza Hawkeye, King Bradley, Maes Hughes, Alex Louis Armstrong, Olivier Mira Armstrong, Izumi Curtis, Solf J Kimblee, Winry Rockbell, Scar and the most important character of the entire series (more important than Elric brothers), Van Hohenheim. Furthermore as I've mentioned before, Truth, Envy, Greed, Lust, and Gluttony are all actual formed characters. Their presentations represent all the ominous presences of our reality and how we overcome them. Revenge? Defeating a villain? What does that truly mean? Killing/Getting revenge on your enemy isn't the end of anything. A purpose is never all consuming; and in fact it'll probably make you even more lonely and unfortunate. That they went out on their own again, trying to stick to a promise they made to themselves, to not be helpless, that something that is so simple and grand is the true aim of their life, a life that all of us lead, is inspiring. Beautiful~ And the most amazing aspect of the show is truly Von Hohenheim's character. The ending of the anime is one of the most satisfying and sad/happy at the same time endings to any show ever. The moment we realize that Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood wasn't about mere alchemy, and action, but themes far beyond the interpretation of many viewers that teach us a lesson about life/reality. The moment we realize, that the story was truly about Von Hohenheim and his humanity.
Everything about the art in this show is colorful, magical and fantastic. The art is designed by different people, so the animation in Brotherhood is different from the original; imo, Brotherhood's art is much much better. The superb quality for action/battles and alchemy portrayed: There's sword/hand-to-hand combat to guns/tanks to explosions/fire to shadow attacks to alchemy magic such as earth control. The characters were portrayed a little bit differently and uniquely as well, it's something you have to watch to notice (hard to explain). They especially did a wondrous job showing the various locales of Amestris, a country that absorbed many of its neighbors to reach its current state. The sound of the show? The Full Metal Alchemist series is known for it's great music, and FMAB doesn't disappoint; no, it impresses. The openings and endings of FMAB are the greatest I've ever heard. There are 5 openings to the show and they're all addicting and great. Opening 1- Again? Beautiful~ Opening 2 - Hologram? Great~ Opening 3 - Golden Time Lover? Catchy~ Opening 4 - Period? Epic~ Opening 5 - Rain? Sad/Satisfying end~ But the openings/endings aren't the only good thing, other great soundtracks that enhance the mood for specific scenes? Check (Listen to Brothers). Good voice cast? Check. 
Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is a literature masterpiece. Often in great literature pieces there are symbolic objects and characters (next paragraph), and the use of color symbolism. Black, Edward Elric wears a lot of it. Black usually represents death, and the dark aspect of one's nature--often one's own shadow. Ed wearing black represents his mourning for his dead mother, and his self-depression that is stemmed from dissolution and conflict/hardships. The darkness that precedes the spiritual light--reflection of death and destruction of old--rebirth into new/realization. Edward's hair color--yellow often represents the sun/divine light. In Islam it represents wisdom and happiness. But in some places such as Egypt, that color of yellow represents envy and disgrace. The color of yellow in FMAB often mixes together multiple cultures from the world--seen from the philosopher stone. The color green often is associated with life, hope, and happiness. However the portrayal of the color green is ironically used, for in FMAB people who are jealous and hateful towards others usually are associated with green. This may be far-fetched, but I believe that this symbolizes that in reality, with life, hope and happiness, follows death, jealousy, and hatred; one cannot exist without the other. And finally, the color of white: purity (obvious). The philosopher stone's shining of white towards the end marks the beginning of ascent from the abyss-darkness, purification of sins. 
Furthermore when I mentioned how FMAB has lots of symbolism and themes about life and reality, I truly meant it. The antagonist of FMAB's name is ""Father"" and he dresses entirely in white. He fulfills the role of an almighty and divine creator; he creates 7 homonculus' and names them: Wrath, Envy, Pride, Gluttony, Sloth, Greed, and Lust; the 7 deadly sins. He's supposed to represent Jesus/or a Godlike figure. Also, the marking held by each of the Homunculi are called ouroboros (picture of a circling serpent) that symbolize endless circle of life: birth, death, rebirth. Going back to the Jesus references, Von Hohenheim seeks ""Father"" at a church (duh...) and Hohenheim walks right over the water that's flooding the path (Jesus-Philosopher stone-Divine Being). But an even more symbolic scene representing the same concept was when ""Pride"" claims that ""God is only a figure created by humans; that's all there is to it. If you want to bring an iron hammer down on me, do it yourself without having to rely on God, human!"" Iron-hammer down? Ring any bells? Interestingly enough, King Bradley pins down Colonel Mustang, and he chooses to impale both of Mustang's palms (Jesus-crucification). And, my favorite: Flemel's Cross-- the one that Edward Elric has on his jacket and Al Elric has on his armor. Nicholas Flemel was the creator of this cross, and he was a devout christian that had spent his entire life studying the concept of ""alchemy"". The image of the Flemel's Cross is one where there's a serpent on the cross. There are multiple interpretations of this portrayal, but I think that it signifies the most obvious thing: crucification of a serpent (Satan). This most likely reflects the characters in FMAB overcoming the darkness of reality. All in all, probably the most important symbolism in FMAB was ""The Gate"" which was the connection between our reality, and the world of FMAB. The gate represents the phase of life, and the light illuminating from it represents spiritual growth (of all the characters). The gate closed when Elric lost his mother-- his loss of innocence. Then later once again the gate closed when ____ died in our own reality: a gateway that symbolizes problems with those that open it to see the other side, having no choice but to deal with whatever lies beyond it (temptation). Elric opening the gate to see the ""truth"". Elric's journey began because he opened that gate. 
Go watch the show now if you haven't already seen it. It is truly masterpiece that anybody, all ages, all genre preferences can enjoy. #1 rated in this site for a reason.",10

This review is mainly a criticism of FMA since I do not agree about most good things said about this series and any good things that I could say have already been said elsewhere. 
This series is the biggest disappointment ever. This is the only way I can effectively describe my feelings after completing this series. Originally I was impressed by this series high score and its extreme popularity in the anime community by both casual and elitist fans. Unfortunately I was disappointed after watching it. It ended up being  another typical uninteresting battle shonen.  
Story: 4/10
The story starts off
                  well as a mystery/sci-fi/action but after the main villain (Father) is revealed the story slowly worsens into a predictable, uninteresting and unintelligent work. This is exemplified through the series conflict, a typical battle of good vs evil which is the main conflict of just about every battle shonen out there. Additionally the unwavering view of good and evil presented by the story is unoriginal and boring. This is reflected throughout the characters that also have uninteresting and unwavering views of the world. This ends up stopping any possible interesting moral or philosophical debate that the story could present through its themes of war, sacrifice and death and is replaced by a typical killing-is-bad saving-people-is-good.
Despite this by far the worst part of the series is the ending. By the end of the series, stemming from the conflict with the homunculus, the characters barely lose anything: Al recovers his body, Ed recovers his body except for his left leg, Mustang recovers his eyesight, barely any characters die, and the whole country is saved.  This is completely unrealistic considering that they fought a war against a group of immortal super humans. This overly happy ending makes this series seem childish and unable to sacrifice the characters happiness and takes away seriousness from the mature story themes. Another issue that takes away from the seriousness of the story is the rampant use of comedy and the conflicts of death and war it tries to present (No entiendo pq?). There is also a small but existent amount of fanservice and filler which is also unenjoyable (which one?). Lastly the series is filled with ilogicall moments especially towards the end mostly in its battles (example). There is also a large amount of cheesy and forced dialogue that is only made to serve the plot and its happy ending. This dialogue often does not seem like what a person would really say.
Characters: 4/10
Every character in this series is either blatantly evil or blatantly good and mostly has no real motivation or backstory that could explain their actions. The exception to this is Scar who starts off as a vengeful anti-hero with a logical motive and eventually he just becomes another uninteresting good guy. 
A character that I specifically dislike is Edward Elric. Most people paint him as a unique main character but I really do not see it. One thing that is often said is that Edward is more intelligent than most shonen main characters yet throughout the series we never actually see that intelligence in play, we never see him come up with exceptional battle strategies nor do anything to support the fact that he is smart. One could imply that he is very smart from what he did when he was a child: he learned alchemy by himself, he tried to revive his mother with alchemy, and he sacrificed his arm to save his brother’s soul; but all this happened in the past. People also say that Ed matures throughout the series and is forced to mature young; however I do not see it. Even at the end of the series his view of the world is rather basic, never wanting to sacrifice anyone, being unconditionally trusting and not wanting to kill other people regardless of their actions. To me this just looks naive and unrealistic character development. Someone that went through what Ed went should be aggressive, non trusting, bitter and clever, not naive and innocent. 
Another problem is the huge amount of characters. Some anime series like Monster and Code Geass are able to make every character unique and likable. Unfortunately FMA: Brotherhood is unable to do this. Apart from Edward and Alphonse the  rest of the characters are very boring and don't get enough time to develop and to become memorable.
My last problem in the category of characters is Father. One of the worst characters that I have ever seen and one of the most uninteresting villains of any anime series. He mostly just sits around in central while his homunculus get killed off and only takes the situation seriously around the last 10 episodes. He never thinks of creating more homunculus or to try to assist his homunculus in battle. Additionally his motive is barely specified and is left as he is evil and wants to take over the world (which is needless to say not very innovative).
Art: 6/10
The art is mediocre (not very detailed or spectacular). But it is fine and not as bad as other shonen (Naruto, Dragon Ball, One Piece, etc). The animation is good most of the time but sometimes dips in quality in the end it is nothing extraordinary but enough to tell the story effectively. I also disliked when the characters lost all detail in the series attempt at comedy moments. Additionally it does this overly often and once again deteriorates seriousness.
Sound: 7/10
The sound track is fine. On one hand the soundtrack is memorable and helps the scenes convey the appropriate feeling or emotion. One the other hand it sometimes seems distracting and often does not fit the scenes properly. Certain tracks I like are “Trisha's Lullaby” and The main theme “Homage to Alchemy.” Still the sound track would be about a 6/10. 
The intros and the endings are for the most part just fine. Still there is one that I like:""again"" by YUI. At the same time I also hate ending theme #5: ""RAY OF LIGHT"" by Nakagawa Shouko which very honestly sounds like elevator music. The intros and endings are 6/10.
Lastly the voice acting is very good. This is especially true for Bradly and Alphonse. The voice acting is nice 8/10.
Enjoyment: 3/10
Enjoying this series was really hard for me. The bad and unrealistic dialogue and lack of any logic in battles were part of the reason but more so what made it hard for me to enjoy was how predictable the story was. Additionally by the end I did not really care for any character nor did the series make me care. It also felt really rushed leaving little time for philosophy, moral debates, character development and world building and instead focused on the battles: the boring and predictable good vs evil plot. 
Overall: 4/10
Lastly I would like to say that the series had potential and actually started off well exploring some philosophical concepts. Still it fails, staying too close to the battle shonen mold and being too short to explore its characters and philosophy.",4

                This is the last anime that needs another review, but I couldn’t resist. The Fullmetal Alchemist franchise’s significance to anime is rivaled only by shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop. The original version from 2003 stands as one of my favourite series of all time, as it is one of the most well rounded shows that I’ve seen in the anime medium, and I believe it’s a must watch for all anime fans. 
Fast forward to 2009, when Bones released Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, a faithful remake to the manga, which was still being written while the 2003 version was being released (which led
                  to the overall plot diverging from the manga). Brotherhood has been critically acclaimed, and has often been considered superior to its 2003 counterpart. While I believe that it’s a fantastic show (and believe me – if the million fanboys/girls squealing isn’t enough, let me tell you that Brotherhood is AMAZING), and it does indeed do a few things better than the 2003 version, it does fall short in a few areas.
(Note that comparisons to the 2003 version will be present, because hey, it’s inevitable.) 
Plot/Presentation
So Brotherhood follows the source material more faithfully. Does that automatically mean it’s better? Well, yes and no. One of the main criticisms against 2003 is that it diverged from the original plotline of the manga. While the original source material had some magnificent content, the mere fact that Brotherhood is more faithful doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s better. 
Let’s start with the flaws first. The first 10 or so episodes are extremely rushed, and, to be frank, shitty. Pivotal moments that build not only the foundation of the entire plot, but also key moments in the development for a few main characters, felt hurried, and I couldn’t feel the dramatic tension of the situations at all. 
I honestly hated Brotherhood at that point, but it eventually got better. The director eventually found a consistent pace that worked for the show. It was still fast paced and incredibly engaging, but it slowed down just enough for the show the flow naturally.
The main problem with the entirety of the show is the comedy. The manga had lots of comedy, and though I haven’t read all of the series, the comedy worked decently well to an extent. The show tries to copy the manga’s humour, and it just doesn’t work when brought to life on the screen. A lot of the tender and dramatic moments of the show are completely destroyed by characters suddenly jumping into chibi form for a quick laugh. The transitions between the drama and comedy in Brotherhood is horrendous and above all, inappropriate. Plus, the recurring jokes get way too old way too fast (e.g. people teasing Ed about his height is funny at first, but loses its effect). 
The world of FMA can be rather… dark, and it’s beyond me why such inappropriate comedy is placed in the most out of place situations. Luckily, like my issue with the pacing, the humour eventually became a bit tamer, but it still irked me at times.
Remember how I said that the mere fact that the show follows the manga more faithfully doesn’t mean that it’s better? 
The 2003 version saw this, and it did its best to tone down the humour just enough for the show to feel more genuine. It still had the wacky FMA slapstick that everyone loves, but unlike Brotherhood, it was saved for when it wouldn’t interrupt with pivotal dramatic/emotional moments. 
However, it’s not to say Brotherhood does a bad job with its tender bits either. When it’s done right, it’s done well. 
Now before you rage on me and rate my review ‘not helpful’, keep in mind that I still gave this show an 8/10. This show has much redeeming value, hell, plenty of it. 
The entirety of the story revolves around the theme of ‘Brotherhood’, like the title suggests. You see this with both the protagonists and the antagonists. You see this bond with the Elric brothers, the military, with Fort Briggs, and even with the homunculi. 
The plot itself, while having some issues with its presentation, has the word ‘epic’ written all over it. The world of FMA is a grand one, and so are the rules of alchemy, which is what makes this show special in the fantasy genre. Alchemy is not magic – to obtain, one must give something of equal value (The Law of Equivalent Exchange). There are many rules of alchemy, and as the show progresses, you learn more about alchemy itself and its effect on other people, both positively and negatively. 
This is one of the most daring shows I’ve seen in any medium ever, as it goes beyond what the fantasy genre is usually capable of. Brotherhood has a monster of a plot, and somehow it manages to handle its many plot threads with care without seeming convoluted. Each and every subplot receives closure (for the most part) and they all have their impact on the story at large. This is hands down the best part about and so this show deserves praise for that.
Overall, the plot has it all. It’s complex, fascinating, fun, and engaging. Unfortunately, the few but major flaws took a toll on my rating. 
Characters
For me, what I love most about the world of FMA is the characters. The story begins with the tragic tale of the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse, two of my favourite characters in anime.  
Edward is the daring brother, the taker of chances, and the intuitive genius of alchemy for his age. He’s strong, he’s flawed, and he is the famous Fullmetal Alchemist. Alphonse is the one who stops and thinks, and throughout the story, he wishes to prove his worth and be more useful to everyone. He can be considered as the moral compass in the entire cast. What I absolutely adore about their relationship is how much they want to save each other before themselves. Edward has lost an arm and a leg, and Alphonse has lost his entire body and is forced to live in a suit of armour, yet all they care about is each other. You can’t ask for better leads like these two. They develop and flesh out nicely as the story goes on. Few relationships can be so tragic, beautiful, and touching. 
Brotherhood has a huge cast of side characters, and somehow manages to give the majority of them enough screentime for each of them to leave an impact on me. All the characters have their own motives, relationships, and place in the story at large, and you get to see it all. 
Certain characters’ roles and relationships were enlarged in Brotherhood, making their presence far more significant then in the 2003 version. For example, Winry is not only bigger a character in Brotherhood, but her relationship with Edward in particular is far more fleshed out. Winry keeps him grounded. You see her take care of his injuries, scold him, tease him, and most importantly, fall in love with him. 
I could go on and on about the characters, but I’ll let you learn about them yourselves. Overall, Brotherhood has a memorable, fantastic, and well used cast
Art/Animation
Bones, you beast of a studio. It’s a wonder how consistent the animation is from Episode 1 to 64. Most long running anime tend to lose its steam when it comes to production values as the show goes on. 
Not Brotherhood. 
While the animation is not always perfect, it’s still crisp, clear, and consistent. Considering the show’s length, its consistency is an achievement in itself. Equal time and care is also put in the character designs. All of the characters are definable, vivid, and full of life. The background scenery can be absolutely stunning to boot. 
The fight scenes range from boring to extremely mind blowing (particularly fights involving Mustang and the final showdown). However, FMA was never about the action, so I can’t really complain, as I feel that it would’ve let the show down if it were more action-oriented. 
The only complaint I have, albeit a minor one, is the use of lighting. It can seem a bit flat at times, but overall, this show is very visually pleasing to the eye.
Music/Voice Acting
When it comes to the music, the openings and endings are where Brotherhood shines. I’ve yet to see OP’s and ED’s so memorable, gripping, and energetic. I loved each and every one of them except for the 3rd OP and ED. Even though I don’t usually listen to Japanese music, I loved the songs. Plus, when the songs are also used as inserts during any given episode, it brings the biggest smile to my face. Standouts go to OP 1 and 4 and ED 2, which is a touching pop ballad called ‘Let it Out’. Even though I couldn’t understand the lyrics without translation, it still brought a few tears to my eyes.
The soundtrack itself is very solid one. There is a wide range in this soundtrack, from upbeat to suspenseful, and the soundtrack is used well. I’ve no complaints. 
FMA has been considered to be among the shows that have superior dubs than most in anime, and honestly, I could see why. There isn’t a single miscast here, and every one of the VA’s played their role amazingly well. For example, I was a little hesitant to hear that Alphonse’s VA was replaced, but all that hesitation withered away after I heard Maxey Whitehead’s portrayal of him. Her performance came of just as genuine as Aaron Dismuke’s.
It’s hard to pick out standouts, mainly because every VA went beyond the call of duty with these characters. I loved this dub that much. 
Conclusion
After a rather disappointing start, Brotherhood more than makes up for it, as it becomes a huge rollercoaster ride until its epic finale and touching conclusion. With a plot that screams epic, fantastic characters, masterful production values, and an eargasmic dub, I wish I could rate this show higher. I really do. However, the few flaws were unfortunately major ones, and they took a huge toll on the show as a whole. Consistent pacing and tone are two important building blocks that form a solid story, and unfortunately Brotherhood lacks in both areas. Nevertheless, don’t let these flaws stop you from watching this show, as it more than makes up for it. If you haven’t watched anything from the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, I suggest watching the 2003 version first and then watching Brotherhood. 
Now before I close the longest review I’ve ever written, I’d like to address one commonly asked question in the anime community: is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood worthy enough to be ranked #1 on MAL? While I do not believe Brotherhood is THE BEST ANIME EVER, I will say it’s among the greats, and its universal appeal is undeniable. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood captures what anime is and the great heights of which this medium is capable of. I couldn’t think of another show that is more worthy than Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to be the face of anime.  
Now, me being a FMA fanboy, this gigantic review only scrapes the surface of all my thoughts and feelings. Am I being overly positive? Am I being unfair? If you want to take this discussion further, feel free to leave feedback/comments on my profile! This is StillSwingin007, and thanks for reading my review!",8

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the perfect example on how a shounen series must be.
First I have to say that I'm an avid animanga goer. I have seen quite some series with different genres, and I also have other favorite titles. But among all of those favorite titles of mine, FMA:B stands gallantly, as it was the only one with such intelligence and perfection I was completely at loss for words when finishing it.
Story - The best part that shines the brightest in the series as whole. FMA:B, just like the manga, focuses on the Elric brothers as they embark upon a journey to get their
                  original bodies back. Everything -- and by everything I mean from their backstories, the little arc, the wonderful climax and the satisfying conclusion -- is very well-thought, well-done. Everything about the alchemy thing and the (minor spoilers maybe) Homunculus thing, they completely blew my mind. The story was so brilliant and even though it started off with so many questions and so many confusions, the expanding story and the resolution answered them all for us. This story is what I would call, smart. It is complex, but not insane. The way we gradually understand the things happening inside the FMA:B universe is thanks to this anime's gratifying explanations. We are not too dumb to understand the story, and we aren't that smart to guess where the story is going either. All the ideas are very wonderful and magnificent. You don't usually find something this clever in an anime series...
As an additional note, I really loved the ending. It was totally 11 out of 10. No spoilers from me, though.
Art - The art is cool as well. They are the usual Hiromu Arakawa style, not too detailed but pleasant to the eyes. I especially liked the alchemy effects and the symbols, they are super cool.
Sound - WELL WELL. I have the entire opening & ending songs. From again until Rain. From Uso until Ray of Shine. I have the entire anime soundtracks, composed by the brilliant Senju Akira, the three discs of magnificence. I listen to them over and over again. I have to tell you the sound is very diverse and beautiful. The voice actors and actresses are also brilliant. Romi Paku, oh gosh, you guys know how well she voices people. Ed is no exception. The sound effects, voice acting, BGMs, and opening-ending themes are all beautiful, what else to say man?
Character - There are a lot of characters here. From our main characters to the enemies. The 'gray' characters as it was initially unclear where they belonged with. Suspicions and betrayals, enemies who turn allies. These characters are blessed with distinguishable characteristics and each one of them are unique. Even the characters who only appeared for little time can be very memorable to you (I'm talking about a certain character). There aren't any useless characters.
Enjoyment - I TOTALLY enjoyed this show. It was astounding. Breathtakingly awesome. This is not the series you could marathon in a day as you will go insane... though I doubt you can wait for the next episode til the next day. The series is very smart, and though there are some tragedies, it's still sweet, beautiful, and heartwarming. The ending doe.
Overall, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, as I had stated before and I will have to state it again now, is a perfect example on how a shounen series must be. Looking for a series with depth and complexity? The perfect series for you. Looking for some laughs? This series also have it, but don't blame me if you get caught up in this marvelous series, even though you didn't mean to.
You will get caught up anyway.",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist is an action, comedy, romance and drama. The anime is Kingdom Hearts 2, Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core and Bioshock Infinite put together, if you want to know why, I suggest you play or watch the games. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the anime that people can understand the story more and the plot; it is a better adaption to the manga. In this anime many support characters die, I mean a many. This anime is awesome; I enjoyed every minute of it, the sadness, the drama and the funny moments. I assure you to watch this anime; it is worth your time. If
                  you are interested into anime that have action in them, this is perfect for you.
Story
Story is awesome, the “Elric brothers” Al and Edward are on a quest to find their bodies because they lost it because they were trying to resurrect their mother, which was clearly impossible to do and they would punish for it. The story is set in 1914 even though people wear clothes that were in the modern day in 2000s. Edward lost his arm and his leg and Al lost his entire body and his soul was put into a metal armour. Later on the “Elric brothers” gets help from the military, their teacher, the emperor’s son and the lady mechanic Winry. So Edward and Al started to train for their journey because they will fight tough enemies, I mean tough. To be honest I like how they wrote this story into a well ordered fashion and you can feel the emotion and tremor in this anime, and the epic battles. To be honest I have never witness a weak character at all or terrible dialogues, thank god for that or this anime would have gotten a little lower rating. But the bad thing about it is how predictable the story was. You can tell that something was bad to happen to the characters, for example if you see a happy moment between somebody, something bad happens to them. Can you believe they made 64 episodes! OMG 64! I thought it was going to be those anime that had a maximum of 25 episodes, there are no fillers.
Sound/Art
In my opinion the character design sucks, the people in the anime look like characters from the 1990s, I mean look at the characters! To be honest, the characters look chibi and you comparing a three year old to a 35 year-old man there’s no fucking differences! But the art was nice and the animation was fluid, the environment look beautiful and the fights do not look like Naruto Shippuden that the animation sucks balls when they are fighting. Sound there are not much songs in the anime to be honest, I heard about ten which was depressing. Voice acting was great even in the English Dub, but think about this. Hellsing Ultimate’s voice acting of the English Dub was fucking terrible, we all know that, but when compared it to Fullmetal Alchemist, is like comparing the game Last of Us to the game Ride to Hell: Retribution.
Characters
There are no weak or terrible character roles in this anime but I knew that the characters that were going to die, it was very predictable. Edward is a short little guy that can be very hot tempered and he can be very funny at times, overall he is a very good older brother to Al and he tries his best to protect him. Al his not so as “cool” brother, deeply cares for Edward and he wants to get body back as much as Edward. Winry is a love interest to Edward, she was friends with him since they were little and cares for him as well. Roy Mustang is one of my favourite characters in the anime because he is badass. He has fire power which cannot work when it is raining, “physics.” He partners with his lover Hawkeye which has no ability but she an excellent marksman, even though she is so serious and yet her character design is so unserious. The bad guys in this anime are pretty cool because they are not those bad guys that are just bad for no explanation, they do very evil stuff. The main antagonist Father aka “The bearded bastard” he is like a Xemnas from Kingdom Hearts, he wants the power of God and he is required to sacrifice souls to do that. The bad guys you will hate them because how evil they are, well no shit there the bad guys. I thought the characters were great and the makers put a lot of effort on them. 
Enjoyment
The fight scenes are awesome, they have characters using strategies to find ways to beat their opponent and they have to go through a pretty bloody battle and crazy bloodshed. There was important conversation that made me understand the story more. The characters are pretty amazing. I enjoy almost every bit of the anime, but some points of it was shallow, a bit boring causing me to skip some episodes. I like the characters they keep the show going and make it less boring and dull. The funny moments are hilarious and they will make you laugh. Edward becomes depress and angry when people call him short, but he grows in many episodes later. I love the enjoyment in the anime.
Final Score
An 9 (Awesome)
The reason I put a 9 because it had bad things to it. I thought it was better than the original because it had a better adaptation. They weren't enough songs to the anime and I wish they made the characters look less chibi. Some points of the story were predictable but I did love it.  I give praise to the creators for making an awesome anime. I recommend you watch this anime, thank god that they made it. I can’t give 10 out of 10 because no anime is perfect; every anime has a bad point.",9

                Have you ever seen that show where everything clicked? 
Where it felt like that all of the puzzle pieces fit perfectly into place?
Where everything felt so elaborate and intelligently done that you can't help but shimmer in its shining glory?
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is that series, expanding on its original adaption with more action. more story, more characters and an ending that just gives off the feeling of a long journey coming to a close. Whether you agree with my opinion is up to you, but even though it currently sits as the best ranked anime, I feel the need to explain why I love this
                  series so much.
Story (10/10)
The story of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one that, like many journey stories, sounds simple. Two brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric are searching for a Philosopher's Stone in an attempt to take their bodies back following a failed experiment to revive their mother. 
This simple setup is all the story really needs to engage you, and from there, you watch as the show will continually introduce more characters, more world building, heavier plot elements, without ever deviating from that simple setup. 
As the show goes on it becomes more and more apparent in what everything is leading up to, and you're able to appreciate the show even more for themes of obsession, moving on, wondering if revenge is really worth it, human potential for creation or destruction, how science can benefit or harm the world and ultimately, working around the theme of Equivalent Exchange. 
I would go into more but to avoid spoilers, let's just say these themes are expertly woven into the narrative so that it still keeps its core focus. They don't make aspects up on the spot, it feels like the story was planned to be this way from the start
The main power system, Alchemy, is very well explained in how intricate it is, how there are different types, different methods to it, what it means for different people and how it affects what happens in front of the Elric brothers.
The show does a great job of building suspense, although this element is not as strong as in the 2003 series. Still, the villains are intimidating to really make their presence known, and what they have in store for our heroes never failed to surprise me. You'll see plenty of twists and turns, but the show doesn't solely rely on that.
There is also comedy thrown into the mix, which occasionally distracts from the overall tone, but is often put in, basically rest spots separated from drama. These jokes tend to hit bull-eyes most of the time, can be creative while also tying well to the established personality of its cast, and since you aren't always expecting a joke, it makes it more surprising when you're slammed with a punchline.
The show follows the full story of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, in which the narrative had a lot more of a Shonen feel to it. This isn't a bad thing at all, as while the original was a more suspense-filled psychological show, this one is a Shonen in style and appropriately epic action, but you'll never feel like the narrative doesn't know how to get smart. The show dabbles in its mythos enough for viewers to sink their teeth into, but not so much to lose the audience in technical terms. It's an expertly crafted story.
Art (9.5/10)
One aspect that definitely improved over the last series was the artwork and animation. The original series already had fantastic artwork for 2003, with the style trying to replicate the manga in basics but still looking appealing. Every character didn't feel like the same design, even background ones looked different in some way. The action scenes were usually more limited to reflect the more psychological tone but were still pretty good. Studio BONES took Brotherhood's animation to a whole other level.  The Action scenes are consistently fantastic, with loads of detail put into every power, whether it be earth alchemy, lightning alchemy, Bradley's sword fighting, the untapped power of a transmutation circle,  or my personal favorite, Roy Mustang's Flame Alchemy. All of these powers flow beautifully into the action, and with the edition of Xing and Briggs to the narrative, there are even more standout designs to incorporate.
Sound (9/10)
There was not a single opening or ending I disliked in this show. All of them perfectly replicated what was happening in the show at the time, and the background music is also solid. Not QUITE as good as 03 for some of the background OST, but the tracks very much pull their weight. The dub, seen by many as one of anime's best, is actually an overall improvement. Despite a few recastings, most of the original series cast returned for the reboot, and with the added energy and intensity offered from the source material, they get to showcase their talents better than ever before.
Character (10/10)
The best aspect of both Fullmetal Alchemist series was easily the characters. Despite their simple journey setup, both are incredibly character driven shows, introducing many characters and giving almost all of them an arc or relevance in the story at some point. Although some characters like Nina, Hughes, Lust and Izumi get less time here compared to the original 2003 series, most of the others either maintain their excellent characters such as the engaging and incredibly well resolved Elric brothers themselves, the dutiful/sisterly but with a tinge of vulnerability Riza Hawkeye, the incredibly buffed and pompous Alex Armstrong, the rough and energetic Winry Rockbell, and my obvious favorite Colonel Roy Mustang, for being both super awesome, and super professional, doing a lot of important maneuvering and achieving an excellent catharsis, yet still going higher. 
While it is true certain characters like Izumi, Lust and Hughes have less screentime to develop them than previously, many other characters get even better characterizations than before such as Scar, Kimblee, Greed, Bradley, Dr. Marcoh, and especially Hohenheim, who not only gets a full character arc in this series, but also ties directly into the scheme of the main villain, as opposed to being a non-character shown very briefly at the end of the previous series with little impact. The introduction of the country Xing and Fort Briggs adds even more characters to the mix. Ling Yao, despite not being the most lovable at first, became my eventual favorite among them for having a very fulfilling development arc. The villains too, despite being less personal than previously, still have interesting characterizations, intentions, and elaborate roles to play in this puzzle piece set up.
Almost every character has an important role to play, with proper setup on who they are, why they are, and how they are. So many get their own arcs in the narrative that it adds a lot to the overall impact. Unlike the previous series, where a lot of the side arcs felt too periphery from the intended personal conflict, here, they add to a cohesive whole, which I think is the stronger approach. Overall, a fantastically quirky and memorable cast with captivating character depth.
Enjyoyment (10/10)
This series did not have a dull moment. It continuously kept me engaged with a fantastic and brilliant story that never fails to disappoint, incredible animation, and many three dimensional characters. I highly recommend giving this series a watch, maybe even buying it as well. If for some reason you cannot watch 03, watch this one first but if you can, watch it second. Despite a rushed beginning, its more consistent style, scope, epicness and catharsis will hopefully satisfy.",10
"
                So long, and thanks for all the fish!
I put this one off for literally years because I couldn't replicate the experience of watching the first one with three very good friends. Our shared obsession and rituals of swapping theories and weeping and laughing made the original one of my favorite shows ever. I feared (especially after watching the abhorrent Conqueror of Shamballa movie) that watching this one would only cheapen that. 
But, to be honest, I had been through some sub par anime and was in the mood for something epic. So I toughed through the first half season or so that just seemed like
                  a lame imitation of my favorite show, and finally got to enjoy this new adventures. I did really like most of the characters this show added and I loved that it kept the same blend of lighthearted humor with intense action and some drama. 
The ending had a lot of stuff I felt like was a Deus ex Machina cheap shot so they could have the final boss be as OP as possible while still being defeatable. 
I really liked this one. It's obviously one of the best shows out there and it was fun to take the trip back down memory lane. God what a ridiculously great franchise.",8

                I held out on watching Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood for a long time, watching other series as I kept the show on my plan to watch list. Now as I finally recently embarked on to watch FMA:B and finished it, I regret not watching it earlier.
This is my first review and english is not my native language, so do forgive my rambling about..
- Story -
FMA:B's story is truly one of the most unique stories I have seen. Everything at first is so shrouded in mystery and the story is set into motion as the brothers set out on their journey to get their bodies back. You
                  are introduced to many events of the series early on, and all of these are explained as the show goes on. This is where FMA's pacing shines. The story is mostly a very continuous story with flashbacks to the past presented occasionally to further explain the underlying factors that make the show's world what it is in the present. Also character development is very well executed in FMA:B, and it's honestly fun to see Ed growing up as the show progresses. I was also very glad to find that for it's whole run time of 64 episodes, FMA has no filler episodes at all. 
         10/10
- Art - 
The art in FMA:B is very good, but it's not the best. The animation is certainly fluid in the action scenes, and even though I was not the biggest fan of the realistic (though well drawn) backgrounds and the at times grey color palette. But it does fit the show. I had a few issues with the very simplified chibi-art joke moments especially at the beginning of the show but, as the show goes on, you get used to them and they appear less often.
              9/10
- Sound - 
I have only watched the sub version of FMA:B, so I cannot judge the series from the dub. The voice actors did a great job at portraying the characters and their emotions, and I especially liked Mustang's performance. Edward can sound a little bit annoying at times, and I found it a bit disturbing that their voices had not matured nearly at all towards the end of the series, but that doesn't matter too much. I have to say that FMA:B excelled with its classical OST and outstanding openings. Two of the openings, Again and Period especially stood out for me, Period with it's catchy tune and appealing visuals, and Again with Yui's wonderful voice and maybe some of the best directing in openings to be seen. You will definitely find yourself remembering some of the music used in the show for a long time.
               9/10
- Character - 
The characters are perhaps the best part about FMA:B. Pretty much all the characters are so well written, with distinctive personalities and their own struggles and pasts. None of the main characters are too strong, and we will see them succeed and suffer as much. The main characters', Ed's and Al's arcs are so well rounded that it's just a pleasure to watch unveil. And the rest of the supporting cast was also portrayed in a spectacular fashion, they weren't there just to support the main characters. Also, I find it rare for shows to make such good villains as there are in FMA:B. I'm not sure if I've ever actually felt for a villain as they die, but it happened here. It was interesting to like the villains and hate them as much at the same time.
10/10
- Enjoyment - 
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a show even non-anime fans would like. It avoids the usual cliches some anime shows tend to use and it will keep you enthralled during its whole run time. FMA:B probably loses some of its enjoyment if one rewatches it, as learning about the world and its events as the show progresses is one of the most enjoyable things about it, but I still wouldn't mind rewatching it. It's a story hard to forget about, and you will find yourself feeling empty after watching it, because it is that fulfilling. 
             10/10
Overall the show is a 10/10 for me.",10
"
                Well, I finished this anime awhile ago, and I was looking through the reviews and I was actually surprised that some people rated it a 5 or below. (obviously not many people did, but still) So I decided to write a review for this(:
Let me start off saying, I did not read the manga except the very last vol after completing both series. With that said, I did watch the original made back in 2003. I was IN LOVE with it. I loved the ending and I just thought it had so much depth. But I was well aware that Brotherhood was the remake to
                  better fit the manga, so I decided to watch it afterwards.
Now, since I really loved the first one, I was very hesitant to watch the remake. And for those who watched the original, the first 12 or so episodes is pretty much the exact same beginning of FMA. And it was a little annoying just trying get past that, but I did watch it just in case there was a plot difference. I will say, the first episode of FMA:B is pretty much irrelevant to the entire plot. It's pretty much just a ""get the feel of the characters"" episode. But once I hit episode 13, that's where everything got very interesting. 
Story: 10- This anime had so much depth and emotion, that I found myself crying so hard in one episode & then laughing my butt off in the next episode. I will say, this is a dark tale of two brothers trying to restore their bodies. The plot twists that take place is just beautiful. The ending will leave you breathless. I think this anime is perfect for anyone. It has humor, action, suspense, tragedy, and a hint of romance(: Only real downfall was the beginning; I feel as if everything went a lil too fast. And in which one of the character dies (won't say which one) it's not as emotional because of the faster pace and the viewer couldn't get as attached. Only complaint about the plot! 
Art: 10- I will admit this anime doesn't have 100% outstanding animation compared some anime of their time or newer ones from today. FMA:B was done in 2009. With that being mentioned, it was fairly decent for when it came out and it's better than its original. Everything has a deep tone yet a delightful brightness. It's admirable. This is a somber toned anime and the animation reflect that~!
Sound: 10- Some of my favorite Openings & Endings come from this anime. They tell their own little story based on the storyline itself. Not to mention the animation for the EDs & OPs is head-on with the songs! The music they even play throughout the show is just flawless. You'll find yourself loving everything about the soundtracks that they play.
Characters: 10- The development is just perfect. If you're like me, you'll actually find yourself liking and even growing attached to some the deadly sins(: (They are the bad guys in the anime in case you're new to this anime) They don't over-analyze too much on a particular one, but just enough to make them either relate-able, hated, or lovable. If you've seen the original, you need to just have an open mind with a new take on the characters. Edward's dad would be one of them along  with Scar. I also really love how they introduced new characters that weren't in the original. Also, the females in this anime are strong and can hold their own, which as a young women like myself, I can really appreciate. Personally, my fav characters will always by Greed, Alphonse, Roy, & Winry. Who's yours? :3
Enjoyment: 10- This is my favorite anime of all time and nothing has change my mind about that. It's actually funny, my friend even gave me a list of anime to watch and said ""this will surely think differently."" And y'know? They didn't(: This is one of the few animes where it left me stunned. Brotherhood made me cry, laugh, cry some more, laugh even harder, and left me in suspense. This is an anime that will touch your heart & never leave! 
Overall: 10- I enjoyed it 100% Except maybe the beginning, but I promise all of you that it is worth it. The amount of episodes tends to put people off, but it IS WORTH ALL YOUR TIME. This anime is beautiful. And I want all of you to know that this anime isn't just ranked #1 on this site because it's well known. It is because over 100,000 people all over the world rated this anime a perfect 10. ^.^
I do recommend watching the original first just to compare the two! 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a masterpiece.",10
"
                Many have seen FMAb series and consider it one of the best anime. I watched it in having doubt of “Hmm... What could be so special about just some fight-kill shounen anime?” and at the end...I was at loss for words. Because it is VERY WELL DONE. There is some debate about “Which series is better? 2003 or 2009” But I will get to that later. 
Story 10/10
Overall: Slow buildup nonetheless very coherent and strong story
minus point: first 15 episodes’ pacing problem and its comedy. 
The story itself is VERY coherent and complete. It follows the original manga from start to end, so no fillers
                  and every episode has some meaning and connection to its end. Brotherhood series is comparable to jigsaw puzzle that you get pieces from here and there and at the end, everything comes together as a beautiful picture conveying one message. But. there are few irritations mainly based on pacing and comedy placement. This is what original fullmetal alchemist attack most on its brother and it is true. The first 15 episodes or so is very rushed and comedy is a bit uncontrolled. But after that, pacing problem gets settled and comedy.... you kind of get used to it. Also another problem is that although finale proportion more than makes up for the wait, you have to get through first tens of episodes to get to the most intense part which is the last 10-20 episodes. 
Art 10/10
Overall: Top notch quality. Unique character design and beautiful scenary. Rare deformed art. 
minus point: Those who have seen original might not like it. Not to standard “MOE” art too. Well.. I could sum it up as personal preference(Although I prefer brotherhood, I like original art style)
Another point that originals point out about brotherhood. Personally I prefer original style because it just has more slimmer, cuter character design. But, once again, not much of a problem- the art itself is very clear, scenary well described and overall well-done too. Although it does stand apart from the standard “MOE” art. Quality is once again very top-notch and character design.. need I say more?
Sound: 9/10
Overall: Well going along ops, eds and some memorable ones too. Great bgm.
......maybe not as memorable as original though...
 Once again in comparison to the original series. First op-YUI “Again”, First ed- Sid “Uso”/ Second op-NICO touches the wall “Hologram”, Second ed- “Let it out”/ Third op-Sukima Switch “Golden time lover”, Third ed Tsunaida – Lil'B/ Fourth op Chemistry “Period”, Fourth ed Scandal “Shunkan Sentimental/ Fifth op Sid ”Rain, Fifth ed “Ray of light”/ The op and ed are pretty well placed, especially second ending which had many episodes which literally needed some “letting out” and fourth op and ed. The most preferred op in brotherhood generally in western fandom is “Period”. I am from Asian country which also has many, MANY brotherhood fans and the best song of the whole series is considered to be Sid’s “Rain”. Not only good ops and eds, It has some amazing bgms too. The best example would be “Trisha’s lullaby” or “Main theme” from soundtracks. Especially, FANTASTIC JOB with placing “Main Theme”. If you watched it, you will know what I mean and if you haven’t why don’t you check it out yourself?
Though... there are lots of fans that in terms of soundtrack, original series did better.. and I kinda agree. Still top-notch though. 
Character 10/10(maybe even more)
Overall: Right kind of growth to each and every character. 3d character that is independent of the show’s main protagonist and has his or her own goals. 
I have seen many reviews that point out good character development, but usually they don’t point out “how” Because original series did a superb job on thinking about humanity and deep ptsds and mother complexes and such, the character development of brotherhood is considered to be shallow but if you really think that, you may have to rethink the meaning of “character development”
The main viewpoint is that how main protagonist “Edward Elric” who is child prodigy, goes on to learn what he believed to be the strongest merit of human being is actually not and learns what makes human really great. To further elaborate would be spoiler but after finishing the series, if you compare some of the attitudes he showed and some lines he blurted out from the start and the end of the series, you will see the distinct difference. And what protagonist gets to realize is actually the main point of the story. 
Not only the main protagonist, Scar, Ling, Roy are the main characters that get very coherent and well character development throughout the story. It is very easy to miss how they grew and developed but if you pay attention to it, you’ll see how author gave them the right kind of hardship and epiphany in order for them to move foreward. I am actually going to elaborate on that point down below, but its gonna contain some major spoilers so you’ll just have to watch it if you want to see it. 
Also, another main character gets highlighted but saying who it is may also be spoiler for you.....Let’s just say he just so strived to become human, and makes a nice contrast to another major antagonist. 
Not only that, many characters, down to one-episode character has a chance to shine its value. While many shows highlights main character too much that other character’s fight and struggle becomes appetizer for the main fight, there is none of that. 
Also, what I would like to point out is that many characters that plays major role to the story is not dependent on the main character’s main goal. All the major characters have different goals but in order to achieve there separate goals, they have to overcome something together, and that’s why although fullmetal alchemist brotherhood series is a series for Elric brothers, it could easily be another series seen from other character’s point of view... which is kind of realistic because well, all people are protagonist of their own life and has different individual goals right?
Enjoyment 10/10
Overall: Brotherhood is the series I preferred and many agree that plot-wise it is a bit more coherent and well constructed, but some of the elements are superior in original.. It all comes down to personal preferrences I suppose. Solely on its evaluation, it is great, in comparison to original, I believe it is superior too.  
Now, this is the part where I get to the core point of the review. Will you like it? The answer is, if you like shounen, well-told coherent plot, opitimistic, a bit idealistic views, you will like it. 
Now then, what is the difference between brotherhood and original series?
Brotherhood is a greater scale of story which focuses on not only the Elric brothers but other character’s development to convey a message about humanity as a whole. Its basically about seeking answers to “What makes human great” and it the process you will see many weaknesses of human itself and how each character overcomes it. Basically, much more oriented towards “what the anime tried to convey” I’ll get to that more specifically on spoiler zone. 
Original story is a smaller scale of story which focuses more on Elric brothers and drives to the core question of humanity “Is human great?” And by which means, the atmosphere is uncomparably darker, and because it focuses more on side story and each character’s tragedy, although its shounen, it closely goes in area or Seinen. 
Now what to watch?
If you like heartbreaking sorrowful story that focuses more on characters, I recommend original. If you like story that has greater scale and has fights and like hopeful atmosphere, I recommend brotherhood. While original has some fillers, it does has its own coherent storyline, so I have no intention of counting that down. Actually, it is one of the best original storyline animes ever had that deviates from the manga. But, despite the excellent job of original, I prefer brotherhood. Plot wise and the wrap-up of the brotherhood is more clean, and all wrapped up. Also, how the brotherhood places each and every elements and characters are poetic to the point you get to doubt “Is this really an anime?” 
And now.. the highlight of the review- 
Spoiler Zone- 
What is this show trying to say and how it was conveyed. 
 The main point of the show is, as I have said repeatedly “What makes human great?” This is actually shown by so many symbolism and character development. 
Character development
  First, let’s think about Edward Elric, the main protagonist of the series. His father left the house when he was very young and his mother died too. Combined that with brilliance in alchemy, he became a person who was fiercely independent as to not relying on anybody to the point he was arrogant. He thought alchemy was the key to everything, even to the point he thought he could bring his mother back with his alchemy skills. Some might disagree with me, but although it was out of desperation it was also an utter, undeniable arrogance. Who does he think he is that he could bring a human being back solely out of its ingredient? 
  He has seen atrocity of alchemy at the start point of the show, but still at that point, he thought alchemy was answer to all and still was fiercely independent. 
  He slowly realized alchemy could not be answer to all by realizing the atrocity of it. He seems homunculus, he finds out philosopher’s stone, hell, he sees a small girl turned into a chimera with no solution whatsoever to turn her back. Experiencing all this, he sees, “Alchemy cannot possibly be answer to everything.” 
  Also, not relying on others and trying to solve everything by himself could be seen in the act of going to Lab 5 alone which he gets scolded from Ross “Why don’t you trust adults more?” He refuses to listen to Greed just because he was angered which also he was reprimanded by greed “Succumbing to anger, will you lose valuable information and your brother?” This makes a nice contrast when he agrees to go under homunculus greed to fight against father saying ‘he can’t lost valuable information just because of his pride.“ Also, at Liore he just said to the priest ”I’ll teach you the difference between you and me“ to facing father which come the same line replacing ‘I’ to ‘we’. This also relates to the final confrontation to the Truth which Edward says ”I was from the beginning a mere human, who couldn’t even save a little girl.“ After that he says ”It is okay because there are everyone“ He has found his answer that what makes human great is not alchemy but interaction between the human beings which is one of the important message of the story. Note that Ed was the one who killed homunculus Pride-creepy symbolism there
Summed up: An arrogant child who thought alchemy was the answer to everything killed pride, and had to give up his source of pride(alchemy) to bring back what he lost from pride. 
  Moving on to other characters, Scar is also a notable character. Consumed by vengeance, he just becomes nothing but a serial killer. But while doing that, what made him doubt his path was Winry and his memory of his brother. Although there were many instances that led Scar to turn to protagonist’s side, the most shocking moment was the dejavuu which he was in the position of Kimblee and Ed and Winry was in the position of he and his brother. It could be seen that what caused Scar to get out of the never ending circle of vengeance to the rightful anger was job of both his deceased brother and Winry. This is what I mean by what human makes human great is interaction between humans. After overcoming the blind anger, he was truly able to revenge the true culprit of his tragedy-King Bradley
Summed up : A human consumed by blind vengeance has to learn to swallow and control his anger and cooperate whom he hated so much(Amestrians) to really kill the source of his wrath-King Bradley(homunculus wrath)
  Next is Ling. Ling although is portrayed almost constantly good character was one the verge of line which he could have been consumed by greed. At the first appearance, he demanded philosopher’s stone and questioned the secret to binding a soul. When he did receive homunculus greed, he was actually overwhelmed by it except when Ed mentioned Lan Fang and Fuu. He learned not to succumbed or consumed by greed, but rather work with it towards the end to achieve his goal- a rightful growth considering he had no experience of dealing with greed (unlike mustang who was controlling his greed on the path of careerist) and if he got to be a ruler of a country, a trait he must have. 
Summed up: A prince consumed by greed had to learn to work with it than rather being consumed by it lost Greed and got what he had greed for(throne).
  Next is Alex Armstrong. A big softy with no heart of steel to stay in the military to fight against it, nor rebel against it nor accept the duty ‘ran away’ from the cruel reality of Ishval war. Quite indolent compared to Roy, Riza or even his own sister. But after he chose not to be indolent, he stands together with his sister who reprimanded his indolency most to defeat Sloth and contributed to changing the military’s reality-something which made he indolent in the past. 
Summed up: A soldier caught with indolency faced with cruel reality, overcomes it and defeats Sloth with his sister and contributed to changing the reality. 
  Finally, Roy Mustang, who was also in the line of succumbing to blind wrath and vengeance which was prevented by Riza Hawkeye. 
Homunculus death
 Wrath is killed by human(Scar) wrath and god(sun) wrath combined
 Greed sacrifices himself to his greed(for companion)
 Lust is killed by womanizer’s(Roy's) care(perhaps love) for his subordinate(perhaps lover)(Riza)
 Envy is kills himself out of self loathe after his envy is exposed
 Sloth gets killed fighting too hard. 
 Pride is diminished by Edward’s pride
 Gluttony is eaten.
Main Theme
“We humans may be weak, but because we don’t give up and go forward, because we have other people to support us, because we know our weaknesses and struggle to overcome them, we are able to become great.”
  Humans may be weak- it is told throughout the story borrowing homunculi’s lines, and the atrocity of humans. A child(Edward) consumed by arrogance was let down by his failure. A soldier(Roy Mustang) who tried to serve country had to massacre hundreds of people. Another soldier(Armstrong) ran away from cruel reality. Brilliant mind(Dr. Marcoh) was forced to commit human experiments. A priest(Scar) upon seeing his brother and people’s death became blind with vengeance. Humans were caught is some experiment and became something they didn’t want(Ling, Hohenheim.)
  A weak human was just a mere human with no power to change anything. 
  But, amidst that, they couldn’t give up and went on. (Ed, Roy, Alex Armstrong, Ling, Hohenheim...etc.) In the process, they had many support. The child gained new arm and leg to walk with his own feet(Support from Winry). When succumbed by anger, there was someone to stop him from going rampant(Roy-Riza) The soldier caught with indolence had someone to reprimand him for it(Olivier Armstrong) The priest blinded by rage came to senses by his memory of his brother and a small girl(Scar-his brother and Winry) A man who became philosopher’s stone had the courage to go for journey to become human because he had support of his wife(Trisha) and power to go up against father by support by millions of souls(Xerxesians) The prince was able to keep himself being consumed because of his people(Yao clan and his people) 
  Final fight which Father is alone with no whatsoever back up and all humans go up against him and Edward’s statement toward god is a great confirmation to to message it was willing to deliver - Humans become great because despite many shortcomings, we do not give up and go on with people to support our backs. That is the core theme of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Simple but coherently delivered huh.
That’s why I love this anime.",10

                     If you're looking for a good action, shounen and adventure type of anime, then you have to watch FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Even if you're not a big shounen fan I guarantee that this will change your perspective about these types of anime. Overall it is an outstanding anime well worth watching all of the 64 episodes. 
     First of all, the story of this anime was amazing. The plot is developed in such a way that makes you more interested in it the more you watch it. It's absolutely incredible how much thought went into the
                  main story as well as how they made it in order to trigger the viewers interest and make him enjoy what he is watching. The fight scenes may not be the best but they're certaintly intense. Moreover, this anime has an epic plotline that bounds to keep the viewer attached to the screen their watching it in.
     Another reason why is this anime great is because of the art, sound and the characters. The art isn't really something special, its just typical animation you see in most anime but it was so carefully made and absolutely perfect that made it well worth mentioning in this review. The producers have done an amazing job with the soundtrack as well, from the opening and ending theme songs to the music playing while the story develops in each episode that just matches the situation completely. I am sure that you will love the music playing as much as I did. Moving on, the characters, generally the characters were very interesting due to the fact that each one of them had a different personality the good guys and the villains as well. There wasn't much of a character development but im sure you can overlook that flaw comparing it to the fact that everyone was different from each other.
     Concluding, I really liked this anime due to its amazing story and plot development, its animation, its soundtrack and its characters. There isn't really anything else to say about why I enjoyed watching this show, I mentioned everything above. If you're a shounen fan then you probably have already watched it and if not then I suggest 100% to go see by yourself, also if you're not a shounen fan give it a shot it might even change your opinion. For all the above reasons FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets a final score of 10/10",10

                Wow so this story was definitly written by a woman, there is so much that makes that true. It was downfall of Claymore, I mean it tries too much femenism agenda. Let me tell you about this girly show:
Story started way fast and then receives no real develop or shock moments that other great anime like Bleach have. The only mystery from this series is the back story because you will basically knows everything from episode 20 it just a huge manner of ending it. You can tell woman wrote it because they have stupid pregnancy episode where they worship woman all day.
Art now this
                  is crazy stuff, and it's crazy how crazy it is. It must have taken decades for the people to draw and animate this because there is so much details and motion. It worth watching just for the pictures.
Sound makes the same music over and over again and you'll get sick of it a lot. The japanese people also don't have as good as voices as American language speakers so we already know that Vick Mononogo is the better Edward.
Most characters you can tell which side their on before they even introduce themself and if the author care about them enough to die or not. There no real development here, nobody really changes or anything you just learn more and it takes forever to end. Strong women which never happens in real life, happens all the time in this show. 
Overall this show is okay, but you can just realize how author tries to pat the femininest agenda into the show. If you tolerate that, Full Metal Alchemist is a good substitute for Harry Potter.",7
"
                Brotherhood is practically nothing more than a show you see on Saturday mornings or overall just something you see in Marvel comics.
 It's filled with underdeveloped characters, Saturday morning cartoon villains, a huge cast made up of filler characters, random power- ups, characters defeating the villain with the power of friendship, teamwork, etc and everyone living happily ever after without making any sort of sacrifice. Basically, it's no different from typical anime shows like Naruto or Dragon Ball. The heart, soul and just all round effort put into the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime is clearly absent in the rebooted anime. The themes brought up were
                  way more explored and the Elric brothers' relationship and love for one another gave more time to shine and bright. The 2003 show is not an anime, it's poetry. Brotherhood came out at a time where Bones was getting desperate, so they just thought ""Hey, let's just milk one of our old successful series, except not put in half as much heart and effort as we did the first time around, but instead add in more mindless action and forced humor!"" And apparently it worked. It's just a mindless kids show and nothing more.
Brotherhood's one-note show-off pompous characters and excruciatingly loud, bombastic and optimistic atmosphere will make you drool with boredom. Ed and Al came off as more or less your typical Mary Sues. None of their actions ever had any consequences, and the narrative very rarely bothered to challenge and/or question their misguided idealism. And even when it did, their juvenile beliefs always triumphed. In the end, they were still very much the naive little children they were in the beginning of the story. Whereas in the 2003 series, the Elric brothers noticeably grew more jaded, broken and emotionally distant as the show went on, which is understandable if you witness all the stuff they go through. They came to realize the world ain't all sunshine and rainbows and that equivalent exchange is indeed complete dog crap. Very often in Brotherhood, the narrative options to bend the show's internal physics to comply circumstances to their favor. Ed and Al were just too much of fetishistic, moralistic and tone deaf idealists. Ed and Al had flaws in the beginning of the story. But as the show went on, they just became more and more Stuish. They started taking down their opponents with relative ease.
There's nothing wrong with winning. However, if your protagonists win all the time within a blink of an eye, it just takes away all sense of tension and investment. There was never a single moment in Brotherhood where the protagonists were in actual legitimate danger. Thinking you can protect everyone is in all honesty, quite infantile. People around you are gonna die, no matter what, and sometimes there's little you can do to save them. Even when the protagonists lost in a battle against the antagonists, you knew they would always find a way to worm out of the situation, either by other protagonists making a dramatic entrance at just the right moment or through flat out dues ex ma-china. Just watch the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime from start to finish and you'll see how much more realistic, secretive, and overall thrilling the villains really were throughout that series. Yet in Brotherhood, they were all rather shallow and bland villains who lost their capability of rational thought whenever the plot called for it. If you watch Brotherhood more and more carefully, you'll see how much each and every major protagonist were shielded by plot armor just because the plot said so. Hell you even got faced-heel turn villains, most notably Scar, whose race was destructed by the military in the war, who also was shielded by plot armor till the very end and never pays for any of his actions earlier in the story. The original manga author became too much of a wimp to kill off major protagonists in later chapters after the death of Maes Hughes, a friend of the Elric brothers and Roy Mustang. She obviously gotten numerous fan letters telling her never to kill another main protagonist ever again. She became too concern with pleasing the mainstream public instead of actually trying her best to make a good story in her original manga. And by the end, her work became fully mediocre and isn't really worth reading at all after only the first time.
The protagonists are noticeably more heroic and chivalrous in Brotherhood, as opposed to broken, depressed wrecks. Their actions very rarely stray into morally gray territory. This is a story about the military and the human beings are in it. It is suppose to be a drama and tragic series, along with it being somber and realistic. Not filled with cluster forced humor chi-bi faces every few minutes during a serious moment where the author wants you to be immersed in. Overall, her writing skills are sub-par at best and doesn't have any experience on the battlefield. No wonder why her work ended up being plain trash. Most of the background music featured in Brotherhood are not good either. In fact, some of them sounded pretty childish and were overall poorly used in most cases.
 It's okay to like Brotherhood, but it's in no way, shape or form better than the masterpiece that is the original anime. The original author added so much plot devices, plot armors and plot holes into her work. And don't even get me started on the ending. Words cannot describe how much I truly despise the ending to a greater degree. All I can say is that the author was just doing a rush job and never thought anything through at all. All Brotherhood has going for it is the new animation, the villain King Bradley aka Wrath, and some of the flashback scenes prior to the start of the show.",5

                I find it difficult to objectively review Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood because simply put, it is my favorite anime of all time. 
To put this statement in perspective, as of the writing of this review, I will have consumed over 1,723 individual episodes, OVAs, or movies of anime, a total sum reaching around 30 days in time spent watching anime. And despite my consumption of all this anime, I still have not watched an anime which I consider better than Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. 
In essence, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the golden standard by which I compare all other animes. And therefore I find it exceedingly difficult
                  to review it with as little bias as possible to convey the most accurate review for those considering watching it. 
This alone, I hope, serves as legitimate clause for watching Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.",10

                This show is a giant circle jerk and if you dislike the show then you will burn in Hell. I am ok with this. I did not enjoy FMAB. I forced myself to finish this show just so I could tell my friend I watched the show. The only real problem I have with this show is the story. I give art a mediocre score because it isn't anything special. The story is what I have a problem with. The very idea of the show/manga is great. I like the idea of alchemy. The story quickly became a predictable straight forward festival of nothingness. I
                  really like shows with plot twists. That is where I find the most excitement in anime and I didn't find it in FMAB. Maybe some twists were when it was revealed who was Wrath and who was Pride. I just did not care. I give points though for when FMAB made me cry at (spoiler) funeral. I thought it was easy to guess what a Philosophers' stone was made of. I don't think this show is worth your time and you don't have to watch this show to be considered a true anime fan. That would be Cowboy Bebop.",6

                Directed by Yasuhiro Irie and produced by studio BONES, ‘Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood‘ is a 64 episode adaptation of  Hiromu Arakawa‘s original manga and a tangential successor to 2003’s ‘Fullmetal Alchemist‘. Heralded by many to be one of the greatest anime of all time, ‘Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood‘ (hereupon referenced simply as ‘Brotherhood‘) could be considered a ‘rite of passage’ into the depths of anime fandom and/or the anime ‘sphere’ in general by many an anime fan. Thus, three years following my traipse into the world of anime, I approached this beast tenuously and left with my emotions and opinions varied. Did I like ‘Brotherhood‘? Yes,
                  quite a lot in fact. Is it the greatest anime of all time? Not by a long shot. The following review will take into account the factors of story, animation, sound and characters, each component ultimately attributing to a final score. Note that this review is entirely subjective (thought it attempts on the whole to be as objective as possible) and I welcome  open discussion in the comments below…
[Story – 8/10]
The initial story of 'Brotherhood' is by and large very simple: two brothers set out on a journey to fulfil their goal(s) and encounter many obstacles along the way. Indeed, everything that occurs during the course of the 64 episodes could be seen as 'yet another' obstacle preventing the Elric brothers from achieving their goals and I believe this is where 'Brotherhood's story shines: a typical shounen presents the viewer  with the main character and their goal(s), e.g. Naruto and his ambition to be Hokage, Luffy and his search for the One Piece, etc. A good or great  shounen presents the viewer with the latter whilst proffering a story that doesn't feel like a buffer and content that doesn't appear a preventative measure taken in order to elongate the shounen (an issue that to this day has prevented me from finishing 'Dragon Ball Z'). In this sense 'Brotherhood' is an astounding success: everything that occurs - every arc, every character introduction, every seemingly misplaced scene - contributes in some way to the shows larger, overarching story, blending into a whirlwind final set of episodes that leave the viewer in awe of the anime's scope and the writers vision. Coherence and a fulfilling culmination in a series longer than 50 episodes is a feat in and of itself, never mind the fact that said story is both gripping and enthralling. For 64 episodes, the viewer and the characters alike are left to follow a trail of breadcrumbs, minor story details that are just enough to keep the viewer satisfied till the next 'big' expository plot-point, leading to a conclusion that delivers on its promise of a full loaf (my apologies, time to stop with bread analogies...) and then some! Even the chemistry, physics and biology of the 'Brotherhood' world were interesting, alchemy being a well developed concept in its own right, bar a few 'it's an anime' misgivings...
All that taken into account, I suppose a question must then arise: why only an 8? 'Brotherhood' is 'deep', philosophical, waxes and wanes poetic and hell - it even resolves battle sequences in the 21 minutes within which they begin (I'm glaring at you, 'Dragon Ball Z'...)! But there are several issues - minor niggles - that mire an attempt at otherwise cohesive storytelling: the presentation of thematic issues, the inconsistent tone and a flat, uninspired ending. 'Show don't tell' is a literary technique employed to allow experience through subjective observation rather than objective exposition: one of the minor issues I had with 'Brotherhood' stemmed from it's presentation of it's thematic issues, it's almost dogmatic preaching of them and it's over reliance on a didactic formula, harbouring no trust in the audience to draw their own conclusions - an irksome 'flaw' that cropped up on occasion and left me rolling my eyes once too often. 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' was and is the epitome of 'show don't tell' done well and all too often 'Brotherhood', in spite of it's 17+ rating, falls into the rut of 'typical shounen' and speaks to its audience as though they are children, leaving an unsavoury taste once the initial digest in complete.
My second issue - and the most 'distasteful' - is that of the show's inconsistent tone. From the offset, 'Brotherhood' is dark and gritty and whilst humour on occasion is not at all unwelcome (and is often done well within the shows 64 episodes), the constant inundation of poorly timed 'jokes' and attempts at humour draws the audience out of any semblance of immersion they may once have had. For example - and a minor spoiler here for those of you who want to go in completely unspoiled - there is a female character in the show who, like the Elric brothers, has committed alchemical taboo. She loses her ability to have children and other organs as a result and during the course of the show - for comedic effect - constantly and consistently vomits blood, a running gag that is neither funny nor appropriate given that this happens only moments after her immersive 'back-story' is presented to the audience. This level of inconsistency is strange and spoils an otherwise totally immersive experience, again, leaving me only to roll my eyes as yet another serious moment is concluded with yet another cliché gag... That said, the constant mocking of Mustang's inability to use fire alchemy when it rained was never unwelcome, poor wet matchstick that he was.
My final gripe - and it is a minor one - is that of the ending which is at once fulfilling and yet leaves something to be desired. I can't obviously divulge too much without meandering into spoiler territory, however I can say that - on a positive note - all of the major and minor plot points are tied up: nothing is really left to the imagination (minor romantic interests aside). My problem however, was its simplicity - a level of happiness that did not entirely befit the shows thematic aspirations. I'll leave it at that and to you, the viewers discretion to decide whether or not the ending was entirely satisfactory, but I digress...
[Characters - 7.5/10]
The characters are another major selling point in 'Brotherhood' the quality and development of even some of the minor characters leaving me in amazement. Each character is more than a cliché or a trope; the dynamics between them leaves a lasting impression on the audiences that causes the latter to care for each individual far more than in most anime, leading to a roller-coaster of thrills and frights as each character edges closer to and overcomes various threats, both seen and unseen. I think it's also important to note that characters do die in 'Brotherhood', that 'Game of Thrones', 'Attack on Titan'-esk quality that makes them so popular and so addictive. Even the various antagonists are developed enough that, when/if they die, the viewer is left feeling emotionally conflicted, contrary to the expected feelings of overwhelming satisfaction. I do feel however - and this is my only gripe, major though it is - that some characters are more developed than others (one word away from an 'Animal Farm' reference there...): characters who are developed to a greater extent in 2003's rendition are often times less so in 2009's adaptation and this unbalanced approach to character development has multiplex effects on an anime that would have otherwise flawless characters.
Take the character Major General Olivier Mira Armstrong (a full title awarded here for emphasis): what purpose does she serve other than to be the 'bad-ass female'? She's angry, she's broody, she hates her wimpy brother...and that, dear viewers, is all the show has to offer from the good Major. Compare her to Mustang or even Winry and one begins to see that a character who is prevalent for at least most of the shows latter half pales in comparison to even the main characters love interest! Lust, whose character development truly pales in comparison to her 2003 counterpart, is relegated to the role of the mere and simple villain, a character development crime if I've ever seen one. The main villain(!) who is seen only fleetingly throughout the show till his back-story is fully divulged elicits no greater reaction than acknowledgement and at worst negligible sympathy, paling again in comparison to the shows other, 'minor', antagonists... It's a shame, really, one the deducted from my enjoyment of the show and one the forces me to give the shows characters a good, but borderline average rating... And don't even get me started of Alfonse and his good damn apple pie (which, might I add, we never see him eat!).
[Animation - 7/10]
In any anime over 24 episodes there are going to be animation issues. Don't misunderstand me, 'Brotherhood's animation is at almost all times 'good', edging towards at the very least 'very good', but I was never truly impressed. Colours are often flat and uninteresting and character designs somewhat strange (e.g. Edward's telly-tubby-esk strand of hair and Mustang's overly-round head...) and on occasion the background details leave something to be desired. That said, 'Brotherhood's animation is almost always crisp and battle sequences are vibrant, detailed and enthralling - fundamental necessities when one considers that we are dealing with alchemy (i.e. magic). As the show progresses and the scale of battles increases, not only does the animation remain as detailed above, it actually increases in quality, giving those final battles the extra umph required to making them that much more interesting and that much more intense. There's not much more to be said of the animation other than that its quality stand on par with the shows quality - and there's not much more you can ask for from a shounen now, is there?
[Sound - 7/10]
I'll be honest: a part from a few select tracks, I didn't entirely notice 'Brotherhood's soundtrack... It was satisfying and valuable, don't misunderstand what I'm saying, however, in moments without tension or on such an epic scale, 'Brotherhood's soundtrack becomes simply ambient noise. 'Sound' quality is of course one of the more difficult categories to rate as ones enjoyment of an anime's soundtrack is fundamentally and entirely subjective: my favourite opening was the first and my favourite ending was the fourth, however, that said, I've spoken with others who've watch this anime and whose opinions differed entirely from my own to both extremes. Ultimately, in my opinion, it was good, however I leave it for you, the reader, to decide whether or not you enjoy it. If at this point the story and characters alone are enough to interest you, then I suggest you go and watch 'Brotherhood' now; the soundtrack is complimentary and will only add to your enjoyment of the show. That said, it's not one that I would personally go out and buy...
[Conclusion]
‘Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood‘ is a great anime, one that anyone who calls themselves an anime ‘fan’ must watch at least once in their life and one that will be spoken about for years to come. A compelling and cohesive story, with excellent characters, impressive thematic breadth and crisp, clean animation that is pleasant to the eye, ‘Brotherhood‘ excels as one of the greatest shounen offerings to date and – best of all – it has no filler! A miracle if I ever did see one. In all honesty, I’d recommended – if you have the time/the patience – watching the original 2003 anime first, if only to see character development in characters who severely lacked it in this rendition. And to my overall enjoyment… Despite several flaws in the presentation of an otherwise wonderful story and lopsided character development… I loved almost every minute with this complicated and personable cast whose stories (bar a few…) ended beautifully and whose presence is still felt, long after having finished the show – and if that’s not the sign of a good anime, I don’t know what is…

                This is my review of FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Or rather, it's my opinion on why FMAB is the greatest anime ever made.
Note though that I have not seen the 2003 anime nor have I read the manga ; I bring this up because a lot of people who are fans of the 2003 anime bash on Brotherhood for either being a rehash of the mythos and not having as much 'impact' as the 2003 one. I don't exactly know what they are going on about as I'm not a fan of the 2003 version but I respectfully disagree with them. That aside, why do I
                  think FMAB is one of the greatest anime of all time? Because it gets literally everything that a good story should have right and more.
For one thing, it is an epic, epic story. A lot goes on in every episode and the scale of the journey is big, spanning a whole continent plus some of its neighbors. Its one of the few modern works of fiction that deserves to be called a saga (saga means heroic journey of great length) and its world is really unique, original and actually pretty believable. Sure, alchemy is unrealistic. Sure, it does not exist. No, that doesn't really make 'realistic' anime better than FMAB. Haven’t you guys heard of suspension of disbelief?! As long as a world sticks to its own rules and FMAB does just this, I devour a work and its world.
Whenever I search out any work of fiction, the first thing I look for are great and compelling characters and when it comes to character, FMAB hit it right out of the park; it has some of the most inspiring, unique, compelling and relatable characters ever, be they villains, heroes, allies or even minor characters. Edward Elric never gives up no matter how much crap he goes through (yeah, sound familiar? kenshinhimuragutskenzotenmagokuetc... hey, that’s not a bad thing, it's actually a very good thing). He is a bit whiny when it comes to his pride and height but not when he goes through actual bad stuff. No, when he does you can be sure he'll try to fix it by any means possible. Al is also a very great character; looking up to his brother and helping him out with his quest to gain their bodies back and honestly, can you imagine FullMetal Alchemist without Alphonse? The two complete each other with their brotherly love and companionship and this companionship helps them out a ton in their journey.
The rest of the Elric allies, I will not mention as there are too flipping many. However, they are all very fun, likable and when some of them do die, it's heartbreaking and haunting. Yes, even the death of THAT character that died in episode 20 or so of the 2003 FMA but died in episode 10 of FMAB was very tragic and haunting. I could not believe it and the rest of the series became really suspenseful because of that.
The villains are also great. Scar is mysterious and interesting, the Homunculi are for the most part fun and even scary and Father who turns out to be the big bad is a fascinating, horrifying and a really effective villain. One thing that did bother me though and the next sentence is a minor spoiler for a character death, was that the homunculus Lust was killed off too quickly whereas according to the stuff I read, she was a much more interesting character in the 2003 version. It did bother me a little but not by much because the Homunculi Wrath, Pride and of course, Greed more than made up for any loss of her character. I think my most favorite villain in Brotherhood ha to be Wrath. He's just really scary and a very real threat to our heroes and I won't spoil who he is but it's really surprising. And then there is Envy. Biggest. Bastard. Ever. Well, except for Griffith. And Johann. And Dan'Ichiro Sanka. And Hitler. What, only fictional characters count?
FMAB also has without a doubt the best depiction of women in all of fiction. Sure, there are the usual tsunderes in this anime like Winry and Izumi Curtis but they still come out as fully fledged characters and despite Winry being an engineering nerd and Izumi and Riza always moving and being utterly badass, THEY STILL COME OFF AS FEMININE. Finally, a work of fiction where a (relatively) well adjusted woman can actually be herself and acts all girly but at the same is still very competent instead of always needing to be rescued. No women pretending to be like men as if their femminity was a disease needing to be wiped out, nor are there any dumb blondes who get themselves captures or whine about being rescued!
And then there is the Father of the Elric Brothers. I won't spoil his character but trust me he's really compelling and great.
Does FMAB have flaws? Well yes, but some of these 'flaws' aren't really flaws. A criticism I often heard for Brotherhood was that it didn't pack as much punch as the 2003 version. I disagree so much with this reasoning because FMAB is one of those very rare anime that brought put all of my feelings: it made me cry (those war scenes, oh my gosh...), it made me think (war is bad but can it be used to do good?), it made me angry (Envy you bastarded son of a...), it even made me happy and elated. I, an 18 year old man at the time, found myself cheering for the characters out loud when they were doing something awesome as if I was watching my favorite football team scoring a goal. No other anime or manga, not even Berserk made me do such things. Then there were the times where I was really disturbed. I think Brotherhood is one of the most violent anime out there. It's not Berserk levels in its blood and gore but it's fairly graphic especially when the Homunculi themselves are getting beaten up. However, those scenes weren't really disturbing and to me, episode 4 of the anime was one of the saddest moments I've ever seen. I did not see that moment coming and when it did, I was speechless and felt really empty inside. So to me, the idea that Brotherhood didn't pack a big punch is a non-sensical argument as it really did get a lot of different feelings from me.
The comedy was also pretty nice. Edward despite being such a badass is hysterical when he's all angry about his own height (IF YOU PRAY, YOU'LL DEFINITELY BECOME TALLER!) and the funniest joke involved Winry actually KILLING Edward with her wrench. That scene came out of nowhere and the fact it was never mentioned again made it all the more hilarious. The comedy never takes away from the mood though and like the Higurashi anime, the comedy made the characters seem closer to us and friendly; comedy when done well can actually give characters a ton of depth. Edward may never give up and he's still really smart but he's still impulsive and stubborn.
Someone else told me that FMAB doesn't stand on its own, meaning you have to watch it from the beginning in order to understand the plot instead of picking it up 20 episodes or so in and starting from there. While I am someone who thinks that works of fiction like books or films in a series should stand on their own, to me it doesn't count for TV series animated or not. TV series have a huge advantage over films, animated or not, in that they have much more time and narrative devices to explain their story and in my opinion, this should be taken advantage of. Not every series has to have an episodic format (like Cowboy Bebop which I didn't like) especially if the story doesn't call for it and why would anyone watch any series with only 64 episodes 20 episodes or so in? While it's true that episodic anime are more mainstream and probably bring in a bigger audience, the fandom that you bring in with a non-episodic anime will still be big and it will be a dedicated fandom always analyzing and dissecting your work.
If I had to name a real flaw Brotherhood had, I do think the first 10 episodes were a bit rushed. Oh they were still deep, well written and compelling but compared to the rest of the anime I agree that they were rather rushed. Sometimes the animation does look a bit off model and a character in the last episode does look a much older than he really is due to off-model animation. However, none of these flaws took away from my enjoyment of the anime and I find the story to have very little flaws. There was really only one moment where I didn't quite buy that a character would do such a thing because I always thought that this character was way smarter than she really is. Also, what on earth happened to my dear Sheska?! I want to know more about her even though she is as minor as you can get with a character!
 Either way, the plot is as close to perfect as you can get. Hell, for such a complex system of fantastic science (alchemy is not magic. Even the Catholic Church studied alchemy in the middle ages, look it up), I understood and believed everything so that when the characters did search and discuss the different forms of alchemy, I understood what they were saying and was never confused.
My final verdict for FMAB is a 10/10 for masterpiece. It is a definite must watch and while fans who saw the 2003 version may dislike Brotherhood's early episodes, I've seen just as many fans love both equally so it's highly, highly recommended. It has something for everybody, is relatively free from fanservice and it's really fun and awesome in the end.
PS: About FMAB being the greatest anime ever. Lets be realistic now, while it certainly is one of the best, no anime or manga that is truly great is better than another. FMAB is part of the pantheon of great anime, those anime that have alot of  influence on the world and are also very well written.  I won't name them but FMAB is definitely one of the greatest ever.",10
"
                This really is an outstanding piece of anime and artwork in every regard, the music score is exceptional as well and very memorable.  So MANY things in Brotherhood are all memorable that you really will not be able to just select one thing first, nor will you be able to pick just one item either.  This is an anime that is hitting on all cylinders and scoring on all marks, there is little else they could've done to make this better other than expanding the story and length to increase the character depth; but, to be honest that may have been overboard. 
                  
Deeper characters are really the only area were they could've improved a bit, but not by much as all the main characters are hashed out very well.  It is in fact many of the evil characters that could've used some extra storytelling, but that is a hard thing to accomplish in almost any show for the bad guy(s).  Overall there is no real lack of background or dimensionality to these characters other than perhaps their personal or love relationships, which were always handled for the most part at an arm's length.  Winry and Ed's relationship out of all of them really could have used an extra bit of elbow grease, so that when the end finally arrives it really would've meant that much more to Ed, to THEM, and to US!  Adding in some fireworks for other characters would've been nice, but this WAS realistically a show based in a VERY heavily militaristic city and community.  So fraternization, much like army life in almost any country in the world, is basically forbidden until you are off-duty AND off base.  This is why Ed's relationship COULD'VE been helped as we follow them and they DO get off base and they DO go around Winry, specifically.  But, I'm complaining about nothing to be honest...the show is more than fine as it stands.
The animation is wonderful and rich.  The combat especially is always great and for some reason, with this anime specifically, it has left a very unique mark on the anime landscape.  When I think of how the animation runs together and the battles there is no other anime I can think of that is remotely like it.  So far it IS a unique and one-of-kind creation.  It is definitely a anime series worth a re-watch and a re-watch after that!  It is that good and evokes so many great memories of adventure, danger, wonder, intrigue, and with that comes the fun of cheering Ed and Al on (and many of their compatriots as well)!  Getting people that have never watched this together to give it a run through is more than worth it so that they can do exactly what I just said in the sentence before and with that you can relive that experience vicariously through them; it really does make it almost just as fun as seeing it the first time...  
Beyond the animation you have the wonderful music.  The music CANNOT be left out here...  It is just as important I truly believe as the characters, the story, the animation, and anything else that has gone into the production of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood.  This will be some of the most memorable music you will ever listen to in anime.  You may find yourself when done with the series seriously considering buying all of the music for the series.  The orchestral music for the main portion of the show is wonderful and while I may not like all of the ending or opening theme songs, you will more than likely find a few you do like as Brotherhood will have a lot for you to pick from when all is said and done.  The music had to be mentioned in it's own right as a separate issue, as it's so well done it deserves a lot of merit and needs to be mentioned as a reason to watch the series as well.  It IS that good!
Beyond everything I've mentioned, some small details that I should go ahead and say is that the English dubbed version of Brotherhood is more than worth your time.  Not only is all the voice acting done VERY well, but all of the miscellaneous noises have been changed as well as things that typically are not like small text on screen (though not having to do with dubbing, it does have to do with the overall ""English adaptation"" that has been created.  The English dubbing, plus the fact that they have gone to the trouble of replacing ALL of the text (everywhere!) to English as well shows the high level of commitment they had in making sure that not only did Japanese audiences get a great version, but so did English audiences!  I will be forever thankful for that as this is easily one of my most favorite anime--it just got so many things RIGHT!  The re-watchability of this anime is very high.  Not only because it's good, but to catch the small things you may have missed the first go around; especially, if you are not someone that grabs all of the more complicated details right off the bat as this show definitely has some, the farther into the show the more that will pop-up (and more for you to pay attention for IN THE PAST)...   
The story is epic, how else can I put it.  It is amazing how far you go from where you start and finally where you end at.  This IS an adventure; an adventure of two brothers that have suffered from a grievous wound, both mentally, emotionally, and physically...and to some extent it has even taken a toll on their souls...  We follow these brothers as they figure out how to repair this horrible damage they've inflicted upon themselves and in the process they make a lot of friends, they make a lot of enemies, they learn A LOT, and that simple promise they made to each other to heal each other and to free themselves of their self-made curse might be just enough to get them through anything.  They learn in the end what matters and what doesn't and they realize those that are evil simply just never learn that lesson.
Overall I give this a 10/10.  The weakest areas I think are characters at 9/10; but trust me this isn't a big decrease, it's more that I wish they would have added more onto characters that were already there or spent even more time on specific development areas on the main characters (I always want more character back-story...).  The next negative is the art area at 9/10.  Again this isn't a big decrease and in certain areas, like combat, it doesn't apply as they've done a spectacular job here.  Really all they could have done is added more team members and gotten a bigger budget with a bigger studio/editing crew.  Without that I'm not exactly sure how they would hit 10/10.  BUT, they have far more positives than they ever could have in the negative department.  While I don't really like all the opening or ending thematic music for Brotherhood, the actual music for the show is beautiful and basically puts a large amount of the anime produced in the garbage bin when comparing music score.  If you want an idea of what I'm talking about, just head over to Youtube and do a search for FMA: Brotherhood OST music score (CD track; I think the one you buy has 84 tracks, I could be wrong though).  Then you can listen to a LARGE chunk of Brotherhood's music--it's worth your time. 
If you enjoy anime, you can watch the first few episodes of Brotherhood easily around on the net; either on Youtube or many other places, but try to give Brotherhood atleast till episode ten if for some reason you don't like it off the bat.  Brotherhood is a ""little"" slow at the start; by ""slow"" I mean it hasn't gotten into the ""swing"" of it's main story arc.  Once THAT starts up, that is when Brotherhood turns into a roller-coaster and you are stuck in the seat until the ride comes to a complete stop!  This is easily a show I recommend to get on Blu-Ray as a blind buy!  WHAT A RIDE!
Just like a roller-coaster, you get right back in line, again, and again...",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is without any hesitation one of the most serious shounen series. Beside of the good fights it has a very good plot with lots of psychological aspects about life and power.
The story is about two brothers (Edward and Alphonse Elric) that know alchemy (to manipulate objects and transform one object into another. They are bounded by the basic law of alchemy: in order to gain something you have to sacrifice something of the same value). But they have made one horrible mistake in the past. They have done the taboo of alchemy, they have done alchemy with human lives. Trying to resurrect
                  someone who is very precious to them. Alphonse (the younger brother) lost his entire body while Edward only lost his leg. Edward was able to replace the soul of his brother to an armor in the neighbourhood. But needed to sacrifice one of his arms for that. Then the two brothers joined the army in order to get their bodies back. From here the real story begins. 
This anime is unbelievable if you think about what they all handle. The main question of the story is “what is the value of life?”. This is the question where the protagonist had problems with during the whole series. Actually the main reason why that I find this is a very serious shonen is because the way they let you see politics. It is unbelievable how good and detailed it is. You see things like corruption, racism, religion, terrorism, people with a god complex, … . The way you see everybodys thoughts and however you can completely disagree with them you understand what they think and why. The way everybody from different sectors thinks about the value of life is probably one of the most interesting things about the serie since it is combined with all the other thoughs of them. What does people do to get power/succes?, how do people change once they get it? are some other interesting questions that will be answered as well. You can really make endless compares to history. Par example the way the regime attacks a certain religion is comparable with hitler’s regime that attacked the jewish, the one from that religion that wanted revenge and became a terrorist is comparable with al qaida, ... . Thats why I think this serie explains politics even better than Code Geass.
Then I haven’t even talked about the homunculi yet. There even more interesting than politics. It are creatures that thinks they are the evolution of mankind since they are kinda superior to humans. But the most interesting part is that they all have one emotion. Such as lust, envy, greedy, pride, … .It basically shows what these are and what people do if they're obsessed with that emotion.
The openings/endings are very good however the rest of the OST isn’t that good or special. The art isn’t anything special either. The characters are very good not that they are such special themselve but there just plenty of original and interesting ones. The amusement was okay but I wasn’t that exciting while watching it in the first 40 episodes. The other 24 where good of excitement but again nothing special. The fights are very original with all that alchemy shit so these where very exciting to watch. In my opinion that serie had to do it with the story and didn’t had anything too special for the rest however the story makes up for everything and makes it a absolutely a need to watch anime for every shounen lover. So don’t think it is or I find this not worthful to watch just cause I gave it only a eight. Eight is considered as very good and I don’t like to give all good shows tens cause then my favorites won’t come out my list anymore.",8

                Note: This review is going to be more between both series.
This anime is one of the best series out there. I've seen a lot of other people's reviews and I'm constantly seeing the same pattern, which is that everyone is comparing Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to the first series, Fullmetal Alchemist. I'm here to break that pattern and say I love them both equally. I feel that one can't compare them, because both series are very different.
Story:
The frist series story was great. I liked how although it used the same characters and the bases of the storyline, they created something very different from the manga. Usually
                  I don't like when animes don't follow mangas, but the first series wasn't suppose to follow the manga and it took a totally different turn that was amazing in it's own way. For the brotherhood series (which went just like the manga), was also an amazing story. The brotherhood version focused more on the corruption in the world, while the first version still did as well, but more emotional. The first series made me cry more, because almost everything died in the series (while the second series I still cried, but got more pissed at all the corruption in their world). In other words, one isn't better than the other, because both series have their perks and fill in the gabs that each one had.
Art:
The art is great in both of them. Obviously the first version had an older art, and the brotherhood version's art was more crisp and vibrant (but that's just because one came out in 2003 while the other in 2009...big time leap).
Sound:
I like all the openings and endings in both series, because they all fit the arc that they are introduced in. All the sounds played during the episodes also fit the scenes.
Characters:
I remeber hearing on one form that Ed and Al's relationship was stronger in the first series, but that's not true...in both series there put to similar and different situations that test there brotherhood. And without fail, those two always stick together. There bond is just as strong in both series. For other characters, some didn't exists in the first series that existed in brotherhood. Some characters were more important/less important in brotherhood than they were in the first series, which didn't effect either stories. In both series, one either hates a character, loves them, or has no opinion on...but it's mostly love or hate.
Overall:
One series isn't better than the other, one was meant to go by the manga and one wasn't. Both stories were amazing, truthful, and brought tears to one's eyes. I love and appreciate both series, and I hope you do too. I suggest people to watch both  series (but to watch Fullmetal Alchemist then Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, because if you watch Brotherhood first you will just find yourself constantly critiquing how the first series doesn't follow the manga...so you won't enjoy the messages each series has to offer you.) I watched the first version when I was like seven years ago and I just finished Brotherhood, and not once did I compare.",10
"
                As a manga, Fullmetal Alchemist was met with resounding popularity right from the start, and after only two years of it’s ten year run, the demand for an anime adaptation was overwhelming. Studio Bones took up the production, but with the manga not even a quarter of the way finished, they were left with a pretty big lemon to deal with. Fortunately, they were able to make lemonade by writing an entirely new story using the material they were given. The resulting anime was an immediate success, among fans and critics alike, winding up on more than it’s fair share of top ten lists since
                  then. And yet, despite the fact that it was universally loved and critically acclaimed across the board, there was still heavy demand for a more faithful adaptation. Thus, in 2009, only one year away from the manga’s end, Brotherhood was born.
From an animation standpoint, this show was working with a relatively low budget. This is nothing new, of course... Japanese animation has always used a lower frame rate than American animation, and often look cheaper as a result. Low budgets are fairly common, but what really differentiates is how different shows manage their budgets. By using key frames, speed lines and other useful tricks, you can cut corners where it won’t be noticed, and save your money for the moments that need to move more fluidly. If you do this well, most audiences will never notice the difference. The original series was incredibly good at this, but unfortunately, Brotherhood is not. The key frames are a lot more blatant, as frozen heads can move their lips for several seconds at a time while people in the background just sort of freeze into bluish blobs.
I rarely ever complain about an anime‘s artwork, as it’s rarely ever a problem for me, but it has to be said... Brotherhood’s artwork is lazy. It is plagued by choppy, jagged outlines. You may not notice it in far shots, but whenever any character has a close-up, it can’t be avoided. The only exception, that I’ve seen, is with it’s openings.
While we’re on the subject of openings, me gusta.  They are all spectacular.
As for the English dub, let’s keep this brief. It is every bit as good as the original’s. There are a few changes made, but none of them are bad, and yes, Maxey Whitehead deserves to have a statue built in her honor.
So, with all that out of the way, let’s talk about what really matters... The story.
When I first decided to try out this series, a friend of mine warned me that the first few episodes were basically a rehash of the material from the first anime. What she failed to mention is that by a few episodes, she meant the first thirteen, and by rehash, she basically meant cliff notes. Brotherhood gets off to a horrible start, pushing out a pointless Ice-Alchemist episode purely for the sake of fan-service before moving onto the rest of the rushed material. 26 episodes are crammed into thirteen episodes, and by god it feels like it. The pacing is jarringly terrible, the stories are rushed, we get barely any background material devoted to the Elric brothers’ childhood, and key moments of their past are told to us rather than shown to us.
Example:  Remember how a certain piece of Winry’s backstory was revealed to us in FMA? We opened on Winry, as a child, crying her eyes out at the table while taking her anger out on the boys. Not only were her actions genuinely and believably child like, but it gave serious insight into Pinako’s distaste for the military, and foreshadowed the fate of Trisha Elric. How was this key plot point revealed in Brotherhood? Winry sat next to Hawkeye and told her about it. No emotional impact, just exposition. And that’s just one example. Show, don’t tell, people. This is basic stuff here.
One of the biggest problems with the anime is shown right off the bat during these episodes, and never really goes away. From a dramatic standpoint, Brotherhood suffers greatly at the hands of it’s own poorly timed gag humor. Some of the most deep, emotional moments of the series get their serious tone blown away by ugly, unfunny super-deformed moments. Even when the boys are lying on the ground in pieces after an encounter with Scar, they still can’t escape this.
In any case, once this little catch-up session is over, the story starts to get a lot better. The pacing finally becomes bearable, as bold new ideas... At least they’re new to those of us who haven’t read that far into the manga... Are introduced. Familiar characters like Kimblee, Scar and Dr. Marco wear out their welcome, but at the same time, a flurry of compelling characters are introduced. Ling Yao, Lan Fan, and May Chang are outstanding, and their arrival placed a stamp of individuality on the show that it frankly didn’t have until then. We’re introduced to the country of Xing and the practice of alkahestry, two concepts that never stop being interesting.
Certain characters sorely missed, but not so much that we can’t appreciate the presence of Olivier Armstrong, one of the most captivating characters in the entire franchise. A small selection of characters are actually handled and developed better than they were in the original show, with a few examples being Riza Hawkeye and Envy. Some interesting ideas are explored through Gluttony, but I still miss his puppy-dog loyalty to Lust.
It's a high point that goes on for a very long time.  To be honest, for a very long stretch of episodes in the middle, I was seriously considering giving this series a solid 8, but then there's the ending... An ending went so far over the top with it's sickeningly happy Disney resolutions that I had to knock it down a point.  I can't really talk about it without giving away spoilers, but this show goes so far to have all good guys win and all bad guys lose that some of the resolutions are just insultingly stupid.
All in all, this series was quite disappointing. The first thing anybody says to promote it is that it's faithful to the original manga, but that often feels like more of a restriction than an advantage. With fans world-wide clamoring about it being a masterpiece, I had high expectations for it. It’s not better... Not by a long shot. It never reaches the depth or complexity of the original, but as a stand-alone, it’s still a pretty decent show. It’s got some serious, jarring flaws, but it still brings to life an exciting fantasy adventure that fans of all ages can enjoy.
I give Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood a 7/10.",7
"
                The description of “Master piece “, this anime is perfect, almost flawless, I can´t  even remember a single time I doubt of anything of the action made by the MC, this anime has an excellent begging, an amazing plot and the most satisfactory ending ever. I always have problems with anime ending (well not all of them) but FMA is heart breaking in a good way. The correct amount of drama, the correct among of humor, just like life it’s not an emotion at a time, it’s a mix of emotions, fully entertainment piece of art.  This anime is one, if not the
                  greatest anime ever.   
Another thing to point out is that this adaptation is true to the manga in everything, so I was really pleased with that. 
Story: 10/10
At least the first 20 episodes of the anime made me cry, I mean you have to make a really heart breaking story full of emotions to make an adult cry so easily, I was trying to be strong but I couldn’t lol . Anyway the point is that the story is a solid, well made, well thing huge plot that start decades before the original story, which I love since now every anime has that formula where bad guys decide to control over the world and they do it like the next minute they decide it, in FMA it’s clear that every goal (from good guys or bad guys) take a lot of effort, hard work and elaborate thinking/planning. 
This story has everything, mysterious plan, military problems and corruption, amazing fight scenes… and all of this without feeling heavy.  An unpredictable Story full of plot-twists that link everything in the grand finale, leaving you a huge satisfaction!
Characters: 10/10 
(The strongest point of the series) 
 The whole FMA characters are really strong, full of emotions beings, here we talk about MC that their actions are based on the situation, sometimes they are sad, sometimes they are angry, sometimes they are really motivated, in other word Complex like human beings. 
Most important they are not almighty, not even the bad guys, they have the powerfull side and their weak side, the character development is exquisite in this series. I really like that female characters are so strong and independent, clever and fast thinking, so good at fighting (Riza is so badass), in other words, as interesting as the male ones. 
Art: 10/10
The animation is timeless, I re-watched FMA this year (2015) and found it better that a lot of animes of this year or last year, the fight sequences are fluid and remarkable, face expressions are one of the strong points of the anime.  Backgrounds are amazing and funny parts are cute also. 
Sound: 10/10
This anime has an outstanding soundtrack that make every episode better than it is, sad music, cool music and epic OP/ED that are impossible to forget. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
Without using cliffhangers, you will experience with this anime the need to watch next episode and the next one, and even is 64 episodes long, at the end will seem short. 
The re watch value in FMA Brotherhood is super high, you will find it as refreshing and interesting as the first time, but I recommend to al at least wait a whole year. 
Overall: 10/10
I recommend this anime to people who want to experience a deep emotional journey with characters that grow over time and unpredictable story that leave you a lesson at the end, I mean to everyone, no one should miss FMA ;) 
Cons: you will find hard to find another anime that fill the void that FMA left hahaha … really, I have heard of so many people, as well as me, that rise their standards of anime after watching FMA Brotherhood. 
English is not my native language so please ignore grammatical errors :3",10
"
                First couple episodes felt off of cartoon network with how many times they had to tell me things over and over again.
Then nothing happens for 60 episodes except some good side plots, the main characters walk, and get their asses kicked.
They get saved by the power of friendship.
I liked a lot of characters, but this show went nowhere and came back from nowhere.
This is a pretty good starter anime, and if you haven't seen any other animes then you will probably enjoy it somewhat.
Be okay that some side plots or characters will not have a fleshed out ending and will just basically disappear at some
                  point.",1

                REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS:
A tale about two brothers who live a happy life, in a world full of alchemy. Edward and Alphonse live together in a small house with their father and mother. Their dad decides to leave them, their mother gets sick and dies. Once they try to resurrect their mother, Edward loses his arm and leg, and Alphonse loses his entire body. Just in time Edward can transfer Alphonse's soul into a piece of armor. Here their journey starts trying to get their bodies back. Sounds like a very simple and easy to understand story but it goes way deeper than what the average
                  viewer would think.
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a piece of art, and what in my eyes would be considered “the perfect shounen” and “peak fiction”. Almost every element of this show is flawless, nothing is average or even above average. Everything in this show, from its pacing, to the OST’s, and to the underlying messages. Nearly every single thing executed in this show can be called simply amazing.
Edward Elric, the main protagonist in this story is simply put, a phenomenal character. When Ed’s mother died, the hatred for his father already started brewing. He despised his dad since the very moment he left his mother to die. Ed loves his brother more than anything else in the world and basically carries Al’s burden for him. His main goal is finding the philosopher's stone and that’s what he would like to do more than anything else in the world, just to give his brother his real body back. Edward began as an immature character, which developed him into a more understanding person as time went on and got a lot of reality checks on the way. At first, Edward made the mistake of thinking alchemy could solve everything, but as time passed that idea faded away and started crumbling, the idea got confirmed once he met Shou Tucker and saw Nina merged with their dog. Ed believed that alchemy could no longer cause good and could only be used as a tool and nothing more. 
Alphonse Elric, the little brother of Edward, the person that lost his complete body and got his soul affixed to this piece of armor. Alphonse is a character who fought hard alongside his brother. But the hardest battle he fought was against himself and his mind. Would he ever become normal again? Are his thoughts actually real? Are his memories fake? All of these thoughts are questions he constantly had on his mind wondering if he could ever revert to his old self. Be able to feel, eat and sleep again. 
Hohenheim, Edward and Alphonse’s dad. The person Edward despises most in this world. The person who is portrayed as the bad guy, who has no feelings, emotions or soul. He got portrayed like that because he gave Edward and Alphonse the idea that he left their mother to die. He didn’t show any emotion and got portrayed as a cold character who was the bad guy. But the more screen time he gets, the more detail we get to see of what Hohenheim actually feels and thinks. The more interesting he becomes. It becomes clear Hohenheim didn’t leave the family for fun. But had a clear goal in mind of what he wanted to do. He met the first homunculus and made the mistake to create something which he would later regret. He created the being named “Father”. His goal was to stop the plans of father and all the other homunculi and keep his family out of it. 	
Wrath AKA King Bradley was introduced early on in the series as the ruler, and king of the country. Little does everyone know he has a whole different personality to him. Instead of being the nice king who can be serious at times, Wrath is a person who is filled with hatred towards every living thing. Wrath was used in a test program to create a Füher to rule the country. He got forced to try and let the philosophers stone to take over his body. The people before him died and he was the only one to survive. This was when wrath was created. The way he was built up being an impostor while no one knew besides Edward and Alphonse. Being sneaky, supporting the other homunculi. Wrath was an amazingly built character with phenomenal powers, amazing dialog and a great character design. 
Envy, an outstanding antagonist with amazing character development. Envy was truly a masterfully created villain. The fourth and middle homunculus created by father, created only to make humans suffer, Envy resents and hates humans more than any other homunculus. Revealing himself as the person who started the Ishvalan war, ruining thousands of souls with only one single move. His only intention was to make them suffer. Secretly Envy is jealous of humans’ inner strength and later came to admit that he was jealous of humans, while he was getting burned by Roy Mustang, in pain and agony he realized that all along he was jealous of humans. 
Greed, a simple but astonishing character. Greed wanted all life had to offer, but never actually could figure out what he wanted. He got introduced as a simplistic character who wanted everything. But due to his first death and his rebirth, Greed changed into a well written character with a lot of development and personality. Taking over the body of Ling Yao, the prince of the eastern nation of Xing. With Ling being fine with it, he allowed Greed to take over his body, and greed thought he had finally found a new vessel to live in. But Ling didn’t completely let Greed take over his body and let him borrow it. Greed started to learn more about humans, and at times Ling took back his own body and tried searching for Ed and Al again. When they finally met, Greed was in control of Lings body. After talking a bit, Ed asked Greed if he wanted to become friends. Greed accepted and finally had his first couple of friends. He learned more about humans and helped them fight Father to stop his plans.
Pride, the son of King Bradley, or better known as Selim Bradley. Selim gets introduced as a simple kid as the son of the Führer who knows nothing of what his dad actually is. He shows that he is proud of his dad and shows admiration towards his father. He goes to school, gets treated as a normal kid. All, to hide the fact that Selim is secretly a homunculus. Until one time Riza sees something reeking in the shadows. It is Selim Bradley, or Pride. He gets shown as a scary character who hides in the shadows haunting people, chasing them everywhere they go, and they can't escape from him. Prude is the first homunculus created by Father and is called the big brother. Pride has the ability to manipulate shadows, no matter what the size is, he can manipulate them to do whatever he wants. Pride is one of the strongest and scariest homunculi. 
Father, the homunculus given a body because of Hohenheim. And the start of all the problems, the ishvalan war, the deaths happening around the cities. The wars going on. The creator of all of the other homunculi. They all worship him as if he is a type of god in a human form. Fathers’ original form was known as the Dwarf in the Flask. Carried around by Hohenheim. He was more human-like in the vessel than that he was in his later form. Father is for the most part a dark and menacing character. But during his first meeting with Ling he showed a lighter, happier and more human side to him. Father is selfish, narcissistic, egotistical, cruel, and thinks that everything around him is merely a tool used for his plan. Father thinks Truth is a personal god. Father thinks that he is the perfect being, so he thinks god is on his own side. Just before Father died he admitted that his only plan was to set himself free from the laws of the universe and even god himself. 
Scar, the first person to be pictured as the bad guy. Burned with rage by the people who destroyed his homeland, Ishval. Believing the state alchemists killed his family, his friends and his homeland. Scar goes around killing a lot of state alchemists. And even setting his eyes on Ed, who had nothing to do with the Ishvalan war. Eventually when meeting Envy, Scar suddenly realized it wasn't the state alchemists who destroyed his homeland. But all along, it was a homunculus. Realizing he was wrong, after meeting Winry whose q parents got killed while helping the Ishvalan people. Scar realized his mistakes, and decided to team up with Ed and Al to stop father. His character development is significant and he goes from a brutal murder machine, to someone who can see what he did wrong in his past. 
All of Fullmetal alchemist brotherhoods’ openings are simply outstanding. Again sung by YUI is a phenomenal opening, amazing story telling, amazing song, amazing visuals and all by all a fantastic opening. It starts out by showing the complete backstory of Ed and Al from Hohenheim's perspective in only just 10 seconds. After that it transitions to a heart bursting in flames which consumes the home of the Elric brothers as they are standing in front of it. In only a few shots you get to take a peek into Al’s head thinking if he will become human again. It has a shot of Maes Hughes and Roy Mustang covering each others’ backs but once Mustang turns around he looks horrified, indicating Hughes’ death.Its got great compositions, and even amazing action scenes. This opening truly is one of the best openings of all time.
Opening 2 “Hologram” sung by Nico touches the walls is a good opening with some solid shots. But it misses some consistency, jumping from one color pallet to another, switching scenes out of nowhere. But that doesn’t mean this opening is all round bad. It has some great individual shots of a lot of antagonists and homunculi, including Scar, Gluttony and Lust, Envy, Wrath showing off he is a homunculus for the first time, and Father, showing only his body to add a mysterious factor to the opening. 
Opening 3 Golden Time Lover by Sukima Switch is a great groovy song, with a lot of really good foreshadowing, transitions and visuals. Showing off Kimblee for the first time, showing him in flames, hinting that he has done something terrible. After that he gets shown with a philosopher's stone on his tongue, indicating that that was his goal all along. Getting the philosophers stone and gaining an immense amount of power. It shows Olivier Armstrong located in Amestris, at Fort Briggs. Showing she has an army and isn’t scared to fight back. It shows Edward seeing Alphonse’s body for the first time since it disappeared, and you see Ed getting pulled away by shadows into Envy’s mouth. 	Reaching out his hand, going back to him laying on a grass field realising he can’t do anything about it. 
Opening 4 Period by Chemistry is an amazing opening with a great hook, top tier shots and great meanings.The opening panels to a shot of Ed and Al standing back to back with long shadows going in the opposite direction, meaning that their individual actions have inspired a lot of people and having a great amount of influence. And in the middle of Ed and AL there is the eye of truth. A shot zooms out and Besides Ed and Al more and more people start showing, these people are the people Ed and Al inspired with their actions. 
Opening 5 Rain by SID is one of the most detailed and it’s just a beautiful opening. . Its got an endless amount of rain falling out of the sky. It doesn’t focus on certain characters, but it focuses on all of Amestris at the same time. The citizens to the Ishvalan people, and the military trying to fight back against the plans of Father and the other homunculi. Even though the rain is supposed to wash it away, all of the characters are still covered in dirt and blood. And the city is covered in flames. In the later parts of the opening it starts to brighten up, the sun breaks through the clouds and Ed sees his mother walking towards him. And then it switches to Edward laying in bed indicating that everything is totally fine and it was all just a bad dream.
All of the homunculi died in irony, Envy admitting he was jealous, greed died satisfied, Gluttony got eaten, Lust died being burned, Sloth died over exerting his philosophers stone, Wrath died happy and Pride got defeated by someone he thought was inferior to him. The show had some amazing animation, from smoothness to landscapes to character designs. From the beautiful art direction, to the breathtaking music to a beautiful story. All of these elements make Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood one of the best shows ever made.",10

                Through heartache and hope, two brothers set out to achieve the impossible and reverse an event that seems futile to take back. Through equivalent exchange, something of equal value must always be lost. That is the rule of alchemy. 
Words cannot describe what I just watched. I can see why it's still number one after all these years. I've seen some impressive plots, but this has to be the top of the line, the best of the best, it doesn't get better than this. It only took me around a week to complete both series, but I can't describe in words how inspiring and heartwarming
                  this story was. 
Plot:
 I know for a fact a manga plot lines are super long and can be as long as 600+ chapters, but this plot, from watching the anime, was the perfect length. The pace flowed perfectly throughout each episode, adding both drama, suspense, comedy, and even some hidden romance. The theme was clearly stated at the beginning as ""Brotherhood"", of course, but also love, family, friendship, acceptance, and even sacrifice. There were no fillers unlike the original, and everything connected perfectly like a puzzle piece. I found no cliche bits, and felt they established the ""normal"" very early on this time. I felt very satisfied with the ending, and agree it was a cherry on top of an ice cream sundae with milk on the side! 
Art: 
There are many different styles throughout the anime/manga world, and each artist has their own unique style, but this art work felt more original than any other anime I've seen. There were no giant anime eyes or rainbow hair. I got the feeling of realism with the simple look. And even throughout the anime, I found the character's appearances changed throughout the 64 episodes, then they would with another anime with over 300 episodes. Even Al changed with his little hair piece was enough.
What I also liked about the art was the background. I've only seen a few anime shows where the animator will put effort into a background instead of throwing in one that looks like a crappy painting. FMA Brotherhood had detail, composition, and realism. The world was created perfectly and beautifully. 
Sound: 
Let's start with music. Every scene, every event, was filled with the most beautiful music. It fit so well with every single thing that happened. The angst, the dramatic, the suspenseful, happy, sad, and every other moments created such a great emotion to each episode, and they had a tune for each unique one. I felt the tension flow through my veins every time some kind of music came on. 
The sound effects hit the ball right out of the park as well. The booming, the rain, the explosions, even the flickering of a small fire, it all tied in perfectly to set the mood. 
Now voice of each character. I'm a dubbed person, because one, I'm constantly multitask-er, so subbed doesn't work for me as much. I don't care if subbed is better, because I'm pretty sure I would've gotten the same experience. But it doesn't matter, because compared to the original dubbed, this one sounded the same. I do think Vic did a better job on this one then the last because he knew the character more the second time around. Maxey was perfect for Al, even though at time I could hear a girlish tone, but it did set the character very well. And the rest of them, each character had a distinct voice and attitude. 
Character: 
Two words: No stereotypes. One of my biggest pet peeves when I watch an anime series is stereotypical characters. And this series had none. The creator of this story did very well on making sure the characters were original as ever. The character development, as well, was so clearly made. All the characters grew up (for Ed, literally), and accepted what was happening, what had happened, and knew their goals and how they had to change to achieve them.  
Loved the humour added in each character as well...like Ed's hatred of milk and being called short. As well as the strong willed and toughness for Ed and Al. Anything is possible even if you have two auto mail limbs or become a soul in a large suit of armour. 
Enjoyment/Overall:
Like I said, words cannot describe the enjoyment I felt when I watched this. There was a reason why I finished both in little over a week. No anime can ever level up to the amount of happiness I am with this anime. I cried, laughed, got angry, and clapped at the very end. 
This story has led up to it's reputation and popularity years after the completion, and I doubt it'll be going down anytime soon.  I recommend it to anyone who...heck just watch it if you haven't seen it. You'll be crazy if you haven't.",9
"
                This is my first attempt to write a review and here i will try to explain why this is the best series ever made and why i feel worthy of judging that.
I start the fullmetal alchemist adventure watching the first one which was really great. Then after a few years came the fullmetal alchemist brotherhood and i was really looking forward to it but damn i had no idea what i was getting my self into.
This series made me laugh out loud, cry and bring up pretty much every part of human emotion possible. The characters and story are pretty much flawless and there is
                  little to none loose ends. There isn't a ""stormy"" story curve as many series suffer from - where the intro - mid part or ending is to short , to long or rushed. The pace through the entire anime is good. The series does not suffer either from things like to slow riddles-to-answers rate or to fast story. Every single one of the characters are developed in a brilliant way, you will feel sorry for some, you will cry for others, you will get mad at many, and you will laugh with a bunch of them, one thing is for sure there is no boring character in this anime. 
One thing that was a major concern early on was that this show would be to childish and silly. Don't be deceived, it is very mature and some elements are even horrifying. This is not some kids show since it contains lots of violence.
Story:
The strongest element of this anime i feel its the story. Like i stated previously the story is amazing and it progresses with the right passe in order to keep you entertained and to make you want to watch more more! I give it a 10 which i truly believe that it deserves it.
Art:
The art is also great. Not much i need to say, i give it a 9

The sound throughout the anime was simply amazing. I loved almost every single one of the openings and most of the endings, Plus the battle music was also good and it doesn't distract you from the actual battle. I give it a 10
Characters:
The second strongest element in FMA is the characters. I loved the all a 10+ here no question about it.
Enjoyment:
You will enjoy this anime there is no doubt about it. It doesnt matter if you are into this kind of anime or not, It simply is so amazing that you will like it nevertheless. 10
Overall: I find this anime to be exceptional and i will give it the 10 that it deserves.
Pure Perfection. If you haven't already you should definitely give it a try! It completely changed my view about it anime since it was my first. I hope you enjoy it as much as i did :D",10

                When I heard they were re-doing Fullmetal Alchemist I was cautious to say the least, having enjoyed the series and movie while savoring the different flavor the manga original offered.
I am pleased to say I got past my skepticism and tried this show out - at least for these first few episodes that have been released.  For the classic story parts that became the backbone of the manga the representation is more accurate than the first series was, offering a literal different flavor on the same thing -- in some cases leading to better dialogue.  There is also a CLEAR throughline that the
                  creators are taking it up a notch from previous installments - the antagonist fights thus far (3 eps out when this was written) have had a very good feel to them and allowed a vivid color representation of a fun tale.
If you enjoyed the other incarnations of this series, you can easily overlook any redundancies here and have a good time with this show.",9
"
                Look, FMAB is an epic tale. I really enjoy watching it, but there is just something that really disappoints me every time I watch another episode: The pacing is too damn fast!  The only thing they accomplished with this series is to tell the story of the manga as fast as they could...Like a heroine shot straight in the veins...
 I loved the first series: FMA. Even though the plot was different there were so many more moments that really captivated me emotionally! But I couldn't feel any of this in FMAB...They could easily have made 100 episodes without one single filler, but somehow
                  they chose to create a lite version of the manga... That's why I would rank FMA higher than FMAB...
 Although I can't wait to know how the story ends (I'm currently at 51), I know that the ""magic"" that really captivated me has long been gone in this anime....
Somehow I have a feeling that not a lot of people seem to have issues with the fast pacing, so it may be some little whinig of a veteran FMA fan :P",7
"
                Alright, this is my first review of an anime so hopefully you are going to bear with the mistakes :)
Story: 10/10, very original story, great development with little to no boring moments, it kept me entertained and watching it till the very end, it lasts for quite a good time up to 64 episodes with only one filler episode. I literally loved this anime, first time when I went to watch it I dropped it because I felt it isn't anything special, but trust me all the sad and happy heart fullfilling emotions make you want to marathon it. I finished it in 4 days
                  and I can officially say it's in my top 3 animes. I can't say too much because it will somewhat spoil the anime, but story is around Edward and Alphonse who are brothers, they go on through their adventure fighting many villians who are all creative and trust me I even liked some of the villians as they all had creative and beautiful back story and development. Story has sweet romance aswell, I would've literally killed for a kiss at the end atleast but oh well, still trust me you will love it, it will make you blush :3. It has tons of comedy moments aswell and heart breaking moments aswell, in the end I'm going to rate the story/plot of this anime as outsanding 10/10.
Art: Art is quite decent, it isn't anything outstanding and unique but is really nice, pretty well done effects and nicely made characters and surroundings. I will rate it 8/10, as it's very good but nothing that makes your mouth go WOW.
Sound: Characters all have lovable sounds that really go with their art and all the moments are very nicely acted, first opening scene soundtrack literally is Amazing for me, others are nice aswell too. Sounds of suroundings and effects are very nicely done aswell, in the end I'll rate it 9/10 because it isn't perfect as story is for me but is really well made.
Character: I loved all the characters, not even one was boring, all unique well acted,good art, nice character development and really nice back stories, making all main/supporting characters feel real and having their own persona in the whole story, making everyone of them like puzzle part of a puzzle. I gotta rate 10/10
Enjoyment: I can't say too much, but all the sad/happy/romantic/badass/rage moments all were entertaining, story never got repetative and it only evolved into a better and better show, I never even once got bored. 10/10.
After all that I have to say my score has to be 10/10, I suggest everyone to watch it, it isn't perfect, no anime is perfect but truly, it is one of the best and deserves it's spot on MAL for a reason. Longest show I ever watched that  I loved so much and never got bored. FMA:B is love, FMA:B is life. lel, hopefully this review will help some of you and you will find this anime as great as I did.
P.S sorry for spelling mistakes and such, I'm on phone :r see ya all",10

                Hiromu Arakawa's Fullmetal Alchemist is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. It is larger than life yet deeply personal. It touches on loss, the meaning of life, cultural diversity, the dangers of science, Nazism, the Iraq war, and the list goes on. Arakawa seamlessly weaves so coherent a story from such divergent threads that it mirrors the skill of a first-rate novelist. She is a brilliant world-builder and her characters are exceptional.
For instance, Arakawa's representation of women breaks with convention. There are strong, independent women like Izumi Curtis, Riza Hawkeyes, and Olivia Armstrong. These characters are complex and unique, as one can
                  notice from each character's distinct source of independence – confidence (Izumi), resolve (Hawkeyes), and leadership (Armstrong). There are tenderhearted mothers like Gracia Hughes and Trisha Elric; and those who cannot be captured by such umbrella terms like Winry Rockbell, Maria Ross, and May Chang. I suppose it's only natural for Japan's most successful female mangaka to embody such an ambitious project – to portray the totality of womanhood: thèse, antithèse, et synthèse. Furthermore, she gives plenty of time and space to include the backstory of every character. None of them has an uninteresting backstory and they all somehow play key roles in this mysterious world.
Despite the presence of alchemy, the world of Fullmetal Alchemist is very similar to ours. It is full of racism, hatred, war, greed, love, compassion, and courage. Alchemy is used as a metaphor for power, knowledge, and science. It seems magical at first, but one soon realizes that its rules cannot be bended much like the laws of nature. Even though they have such a powerful tool, we keep encountering those who wish to go beyond its limits. Alchemy is, arguably, a reflection of our weakness. As the philosopher Julian Savulescu noted, humans are much better at solving abstract problems than learning how to work together as a whole. Edward's final decision in the show alludes to Arakawa's message that we do not need to rely on knowledge and science to lead a meaningful life. Instead, we need to accept the human condition. Similar to Aristotle's notion of the Good Life, Ed and Al choose to pursue virtues like friendship, altruism, humility, and compassion. Humanity was not meant to know everything, and the human condition bids us to focus on the Good rather than the Truth. It appears that Arakawa is a pragmatist– knowledge is useful insofar as it is practical.
The animé-adaptation successfully captures the strengths of its illustrious source through fast-pace, quality animation, and stellar opening and ending themes. This animé is one of my favorites, and I absolutely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good work of art.",10
"
                This is my first review. I decided to write reviews to practice my English while sharing my thoughts on anime/mangas I dedicated my time to, so errors are inevitable. I apologize for that in advance.
Story: 9.5
Two brothers are left alone when their mother died. Trying to revive her with alchemy made things worse: the younger brother lost his whole body while the other lost his limbs. Now they're searching for a method to return their normal bodies. Doing their best to do that, they stumbled upon the planning of the worst disaster which is about to happen. Elric brothers along with their friends try to
                  stop that.
The story is unique, the phasing and theme (Alchemy and equivalent exchange) are great. But I didn't give it a perfect score because I find it clichè-ish for a story to begin because of a sad/tragic experience.
Art:8
The art meets the standard quality of the animes of that time. The fights are usually exciting. I love the characters' design but I didn't appreciate the mangaka's style. Maybe just my personal taste
Sound: 10
Voice acting is excellent. The voice actors fit their characters. Roy's and Ed's are just heh!
The music is amazing. To start it off, YUI-Again and Tsunaida te are some of my favorites. But every op and ed are really likeable even though some needs time. Even the most hated op (golden time lover I think). The themes are awesome. They will really leave an impact to you, most of the time I had goosebumps (more goosebumps, for some reason, now that I'm rewatching it). Lapis philosophorum, Trisha's and Resembool's lullaby, and the main theme are the best.
Character:9
Character development and hardships are shown and explained perfectly. For example, a mass murderer full of hatred is now trying his best to reform the country without a war or a revolution. The relationship between the brothers is so strong. Seeing for the first time, I thought the main female would be an annoying and weak girl; I was wrong. Okay, she cried and was weak a couple of times but because of that she stood up, became Ed, Al and many other people could rely on. Villains did a great job pissing me off except Lust, I loved her.
 Enjoyment:10
I really enjoyed this anime not only enjoyed but adored it. Good thing I watched it long after my cousin recommended it, because I was young and I'm sure i'm not gonna understand a thing (Having a sort of mystery genre). The negative thing is I watched the 1st series and it became a kind of spoiler at beginning. And I missed the Kyoudai soundtrack. 
---------- Spoilers-------
Best scenes I totally enjoyed: the way they passed the note for the promised day, hawkeye and Roy's communications, main protagonist's last transmutation and many others that if I were to list it, Boom. Ps. The death of those two q.q",10
"
                I don't even know how I watched the original anime series after watching this one. I knew the story seemed out of sorts in the first anime and was seriously considering reading the manga because I wanted the real story. Well, this anime goes back to the beginning and does it right.
I don't know how an anime can be this damn good. It boils my blood! I'm literally intoxicated by it. It's more amazing than anything else I have EVER seen and I have been watching anime for a LONG time.
I don't think that anything could top this. Ever.
              ",10
"
                Extremely overrated and it is beyond me how this anime has such good ratings. The highlight of this anime for me was when Ed encounters the chimera girl, it was a super dark and sad moment that made me think the rest of the series would be of this quality. But no, it then becomes an unfunny boring cliche mess with stupidly one-note characters.
This show has many attempts at humor but it just fails, it seems to be catered at kids and teenagers, with a somewhat ""dark"" tone. I felt like I was watching a marvel show at times. I mean seriously the villains character
                  design is so boring it is beyond me, so many other great anime deserve the spot this one has. ill never get how this is so popular, but maybe I just didnt get it. It was a slog to get through. The only reason im giving it one more point in the score is because of the Amazing music, as a musician I can tell a lot of effort was put into it, but apart fom that this anime is terrible. Avoid and watch Hunter X Hunter instead.",2
"
                ""You cannot gain anything without sacrificing something. In this world it's called Equivalent exchange.""
When I first learned that the Brotherhood is being prepared I felt chills. The first series was mostly great, with some weaker elements. The epicness spilled from it no matter which approach you took. However, what really got me into the topic of Elric brothers was not the anime, but the manga. The manga which, to some extend, changed the way I perceive things today. The manga which taught me a lot about life, friendship, priorities. The manga which showed that if you wish for something strong enough - you will receive
                  it, albeit after a long and harsh journey. After all, nothing in this world comes without a price. Equivalent exchange works there indefinitely. 
Ok, I may sound like a damn brat at the moment, corellating human's life to a fabricated reality. Whatever. I 
always believed that animes have this something that we lack in our everyday struggle - they name things, without second thought, no questions asked.
The story of Elric brothers is well known to about everyone who's interested in anime. The siblings lose their limbs and bodies due to a foolish act of human transmutation. From this moment, Ed with automail leg and arm and his younger brother Al, an armor with soul attached to it, go on a long and depriving journey to retrieve what they lost and are afraid will never grasp back. As simple as it sounds, it can be quite amusing.
STORY.
Although to some it may appear cliche, the story in FMA:B is in fact quite original. First and foremost it mixes many completely various characters in several settings. Those characters somehow resemble their homeplaces in terms of nature, feelings and appearance so when the things go hectic and the Elrics travel from one place to another it's not a hassle to distinguish who doesn't really fit the image. Thus we have Ishbalans, Northerners (Briggs), Southerners (Rush Valley), Westerners in Liore and people from Central. The power of the setting is what makes the place differ completely one from the other. People are different and so are their homes, beliefs, approaches to life. It's all there to entertain you, sure, but if you look deep enough all those people exist for the sole purpouse of making the story believable and the Elrics progress enough to overcome their childish beliefs, behaviors and trusts for something that lays far beyond - A Truth. ""A"" is used here for a reason. In FMA:B 'Truth' exists in everyone and it's individual for all people. There's no universal truth, you create your own with your blood, sweat and tears.
Beyond that is the approach to the siblings, the way  those two change and evolve into the people who will overthrow their own goal for a common one - the protection of Amestris. It is also frightening when you notice how much they had to sacrifice to reach to that final moment, the moment of glory, retribution, stepping back and unfolding their whole way to that very moment. Throughout the story they learn that All is the World, but the World consists of singularities, of humans; thus All is One, One is All. It's a masterpiece in its own kind to see how this universal idea reflects all the decisions that the brothers make during the show. Some will lead to further complications and some will become tragic in the end.
A great deal of epicness is ensured by splendid character development in the series. It is refreshing to see how much people progress in this show. Humans are cunning, symphatetic, intelligent and dumb. They're evil and good, direct and retracted, they tell lies and are truthful to their bones. They Envy, they are Greedy but also Sloth and driven by Lust. Their Gluttony for power gives birth to overthrowing Wrath if something goes wrong, but in the end it is their Pride that keeps them going. What about the others? Those perfect? Those who deprived themselves of these Seven Sins? Are they better, perfect? God a-like? Or maybe they are a puny little entities hidden within their own flasks longing for escape, freedom.
The creation of Elrics is perfect. They are like the two sides of the same coin: Ed is decisive, outgoing and operative, Al is his counterpart - depending, self-aware and perhaps to impressionable. Other characters shine too: Alex is as entertaining as always, Mustang as cunning as he could be and kindness flowing from Hawkeye or Winry is sometimes just too much. You will cry many times during the show, it's a given.
ART.
Art is nearly perfect. The animation is splendid, with very little flaws, very little recaps and no stupid mistakes. The way the world is potrayed stands out practically all the time. On one hand we have beatifully painted backgrounds, with delicate fresque and detailed texture which endulge one's mind to further concentration. Places are different, stunning, memorable. The very same idea sticks to the presentation of characters. There's no denying that women are somehow neglected in the show, but this is due to the manga artist and his style, not the anime itself. It simply follows the pattern as accurately as possible. On the other hand, hardly will you see a situation when recognising a particular character is impossible due to a bad drawing. In this show it does not happen. 
Period.
All the details of using alchemy, ground reformation, CGI effects are simply perfect and I cannot imagine what the show would be like without them. Rarely will you notice that something is wrong or our of ordinary and this becomes even more important by the end of the show, because the level of animation does not drop! Not one bit! It's constant throughout all 64 episodes. Even today it's astounding, escpecially for such long show.
MUSIC.
Music and audio is something I would write an entire book about if I had time and means to do so. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful Japanese creations in the history of the anime market. It can be depicted by: when it is time to cry, go cry, when you laugh, go laugh and when there's fighting, well, go kick ass! Nothing is out of place, nothing is missing. The background, most of the time, is very lyrical. There are moments when you would stop with Ed and Al for a second to contemplate, but the action will not let you. Music is such a strong reinforcement in FMA:B, that sometimes a scene when there's a deafening silence leaves no quarter and distinguishes among many other. Nothing bad will I say about opening and ending sequences - those are splendid. ""Let it out"", ""Period"", ""Rain"" - are only a few examples of how great the soundtrack is. I didn't like how the producers included major spoilers in those sequences though, but that's an entirely different thing altogether.
Seiyuu's work also requires a few words of praise - people voice acting Ed and Al are one of the best creations I have ever seen in anime. The same goes for General Armstrong and Roy Mustang. Greed/Lin has also had some great voice acting as well as all the Homonculi and 'Our Father'. All in all, one of the very best in the industry. Great job altogether. At this point it is worth mentioning that the moment when Ed shouts 'You idiot!' in final but one episode is the scene when not one 100% man will shed some tears.
ENJOYMENT.
Some may say that it's fraud because I do not mention alchemy in this review. Well, it is because most of know what alchemy in FMA series is, and besides that, alchemy plays only the second role in FMA:B. Sure, it is important (especially Alkahestry) plotwise, but as you will reach the end of the show you will learn how insignificant it was throughout the whole series from the characters' point of view.
But hey, this was supposed to be enjoyment section... Although, most of you have already noticed that I described how enjoyable the series is/was in the STORY segment. I watched the series three times so far and I'm sure that the fourth and fifth will come about in the nearest future. No matter how many times you watch the series you will enjoy it even more than before, and the comedy parts never get old!
FINAL THOUGHTS.
At first I did not really like the story in the original FMA. It was dumb, slow paced, sometimes much too self-centered. FMA:B is a greater alternative story. It uses the same characters in the same settings, adds something from itself, makes a great use of fabulous comedy elements to create a complete anime which will definitely transcend its time. The FMA, despite all flaws, did overthrow much of the industry. People lowed Ed and Al from the moment they learned their back story. It is no different with this title. Some reluctant will say, that sometimes manga does things in a better manner than the anime. OK, their right to complain. I, having watched so many titles in my life, have no words of complain in this one. FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is by far the best anime show that has been released and I assume nothing will change that in the upcoming months. In my personal list it overtook shows like NGE, RaXhephon or Rurouni Kenshin: Romantan.
A week out of your life well-spent.
""All is One. One is All!""",10
"
                Unpopular opinion: First FMA series is better than Brotherhood.
Sorry, everyone. It started off good, but then I became blatantly bored. It aimed towards younger audiences than the first series in my opinion.
News flash: Just because it follows the manga, doesn't mean it's better than the first anime series. And it's not. It had a lot of childish comedy, which is usually no big deal, but I was annoyed. Some of the characters that were in Brotherhood really bothered me. Guess I preferred the ""Seven Deadly"" Homunculi in the first series to this one as well.
While I will admit, this ending made my heart happy wayyyyyyyyyyyy
                  more than the first, it's still not my favorite. Honestly, if they had combined the first series storyline with Brotherhood's ending: MASTERPIECE. Anyway, not terrible. FMA will always be one of my favorite stories, just not the one I prefer. I would still recommend watching Brotherhood to anyone and I still give it a good score because it was a good series.",8
"
                I can understand the conflict between how Fullmetal Alchemist and FMA Brotherhood in which they differ. However, although there may be a different opinion among those who have taken the time to watch both of the series, but I personally believe that enrichment in the FMAB series of 64 episodes is superior to the older dramatized FMA series. In my full understanding I can say that my opinion won't change for the simple fact I have enjoyed watching Brotherhood twice over with subtitles and once again in dubbed version for a full story in mind. All in all, the basis of the show is in
                  my interest to place it in the highest respect towards rating. 
Indeed this series does have a repetition in its theoretical story and action, but the character life seems all too real. This show definitely is my favorite at this point, but even in that light, I still have just one issue. Characters take quick risks and life changing actions for emotions of past beloved people or wish it so, but never do they feel to me that they are attached until the rap up of the story. So if you are for swift feels, then you should realize that you need to complete the entirety of the story. 
And of course besides the fact, you should indefinitely take the time to watch this series just for an amazing series sake.",10
"
                After watching the original fma you are filled with dread with the thought have they managed to muck up a classic the answer NO. They have succeeded in fulling what fma is all about whether it is the closeness of the brothers the seriousness of the fighting or the light-hearted comedy that keeps it all together it is all here and living up to it's name.
              ",10
"
                I could only get up to the episode with them finally ""defeating"" a certain enemy. It was so insulting to my intelligence that I had to stop. You can tell why this anime is liked, because its basically ""baby's first 'serious' anime,"" and I don't want to take that away from people, but it is so tonally disjointed that any serious thing it is trying to say is undercut. From a technical standpoint it is good. Animation and sound are all very good. Unfortunately, that is about all the praise that I can sing it. Are there occasionally good scenes? Sure. But not enough to
                  make up for all the stuff you have to slog through. Scar was the only interesting character to me. Mustang was as well, before they neutered him. It plays into the ""killing villains makes you a villain,"" anime trope that I just can't stand. Fine, but it felt insulting to my intelligence so I just couldn't finish it. I'll eventually get to the 2003 anime adaptation which I heard does a better job addressing these problems, but I need to wash the bad taste out of my mouth first.",6
"
                Story: THe story of FMA is probably one of the most fleshed-out and fluid stories I've come across. The story of two brothers trying to regain their lost bodies in a world where alchemy is one of the greatest scientific methods is made both very creative and believable. 
Art: The original art of the manga is a style that is made very original from the first page, and that style is put into animation very well. The colors and designs all look great, and the action and motion is all a great complement to Bones. If there's one gripe I have, it's that the super-deformed
                  faces and poses the characters make in Brotherhood are inferior to the funny reactions they made in the first series, but that's all water under the bridge.
Sound: The music is good and all, but when asked about sound for this series, I think of the dub, and this dub has all of the trademark Funimation greatness. All of the actors give such good performances as their respective characters that if I were to run into these characters walking down the street, they would sound exactly like this.
Character: I love how the range of characters represent the highs and lows of humanity, and how they can actually represent real people. Also, I was much more satisfied with the way the characters ended up in Brotherhood than in the first series, since the first series didn't end on a particularly happy note.
Enjoyment: After completing a couple of episodes, I would wait and chew my nails to the bone for Funimation to release the next batch of episodes, and once I'd watch those, I'd do the same thing until the next batch was released.
Overall: This isn't a series to be missed by anyone. Great characters, fantastic setting, flawless art, a fantastic dub (in case you're a dub hater, disregard that part) and just enough for anyone to enjoy. For full enjoyment of this show, I'd recommend seeing the first series before this one, as it handles some parts better than Brotherhood, but in the end, both are stellar series.",9

                This anime will be my first review, it may be many who know both the manga and the anime is anime, anime Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a remake of Fullmetal Alchemist that aired in 2002, broadly summarized Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and aired in 64 episodes of the year 2009 to 2010 
This anime tells the story of Elric brothers in hopes of want to get their body back is where. Body Edward (brother) lost hands and legs, in Conducting human transmutation and Alphonse (younger brother) so Edward loses his sister Spirit Entering into armor, including the story of their struggle is not easy to Edward
                  who had the title of Alchemy Youngest Countries must work as a military dog under the rule President Fuhrer King Bradley, who wish to menumbalksan all his people to desire someone who is called father
1.Story / plot 
In the 64 episodes which is quite long for the anime today, given the story happens very clear and quite difficult to understand where the tone aka chemical elements here (according to the title), the plot is unique and made ​​very epic, with very fantastic ending, grooved mix so even though already in the middle of the plot aka tone flashback made ​​to clarify that the story was more dispersed there mystery began to be solved by carefully 
Score: 10/10 
2.Genre 
Wrapped in a genre of comedy that is fairly common, but the entire action genre there is shown the remarkable elements of comedy in every action that is displayed is really funny, and not damage other existing genres, action given panel is also fairly cool which makes the rendered image the action is much more alive, besides action and comedy, there is also a genre Drama, military, Super natural, perhaps somewhat rare to see the military genre in anime, but in the genre of military tactics given very supportive action genre, and if combined properly it will create action that hone not just attack-attack alone, given the drama genre is extraordinary, perhaps this is what makes this anime more slick, funny and action in addition to cool it can drain every audience terlbih mind again, an additional story that has a groove mix so that the drama will be supporting the plot, and genre super natural / additional power is common in the genre of action given based on the strength of science, so it must be clever to understand what is discussed in this anme 
Score 10/10 
3.OST OP / ED 
Well maybe builders skip-skip OST may rarely listen but for those who are willing to listen to the OST of this anime guaranteed addiction, Song settings and frame was fused, can even feel 1 cour anime in 1 OST alone, but I do not remember the title and singer but my favorite Nico toucher In The Wall - Hologram and Chesmitry - Period 
Score 10/10 
4.Backgroud and Music 
BGM took the 20th century where technological development in the past, music was made to follow events there, to be honest my years of background is very fitting combined with the story of alchemy where in the same year in the world is also in the development of science 
Score 9/10 
5. Character Design 
The design character of the manga beginning of the 21st century certainly is predictable, mediocre and lacking design accentuate knowing I was poor chara moe anime and panserpis, desainya somewhat different from the anime anime contemporaries so somewhat when compared remakannya not thrown I seem to Bones as the Main Art The Anime want a better impression 
Score 8/10",10
"
                A very solid show, nothing wrong with it. Its just very hard to  find anything truly amazing about it. The Story was good, not great Art was great, but not amazing, an sound is almost none existent. Character's are where the show shines if ever, and thus this  is the reason for the 8 out of ten. Its  because it doesn't do anything bad, but nothing IMO to stand out. Its just god in all Categories, but never Amazing. Personally i like shows to be lob sided, not so well rounded i could play billiards with it. Normally i want a show
                  to have something amazing, but with  flaws, that as whole don't effect the enjoyment, but latter you see them. But then you realize  how amazing the show was because you didn't notice the flaws. Full metal alchemist: Brotherhood does nothing like this.All it does is stay safe, never trying for Greatness, but just sticking with""good"". Thus Full metal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets an 8/10",8
"
                I thought that after watching the first Full Metal Alchemist series nothing could surpass it's greatness but then after watching Brotherhood there were very different thoughts buzzing about my mind!
~Animation~
I liked this anime because it follows the manga more closely than the first FMA series. The animation in this series far surpassed the previous series as well. The shading and deep colors added a rich feel to the environments.
~Sound~
While I personally am not a fan of dubbed anime, the dubbing on this was alright. I watched most of it in Japanese, and Paku Romi Sensei's performance as Edward was one of the most passionate that
                  I've heard. I don't want to give anything away but if you're near the end of the series I would encourage you to watch in Japanese ^.- !!
~Characters~
Lemme just address the elephant in the room: Greed. I LOVE Greed! There is not much I can give away about it but let's just say you'll be seeing a lot of him ^.^. The characters have a lot of added depth from the first FMA series and it is definitely quite the task keeping up with all of their back stories (though this is a welcome task ^.~ ). All of the favourites from the first series are back for this action! I know my youngest is partial to Gluttony and her sister is a Scar fangirl.
~Story~
This is where the series shines through. There were many points during the series where I had to pause the DVD to grab tissues. Those who have seen the first FMA series could guess how sad the loss of a beloved character can be. Besides the heartbreaking stuff the story delves deep in to the workings of alchemy in ways that the first series didn't come close to emulating. The series climax is action packed and emotionally charged (might I remind you to watch this in Japanese again? ^-^ ) like the first series but the end to this series is on a more epic scale.
Watching this series really did feel rewarding for me, as I watched the characters develop, I felt like I was becoming friends with them and was sharing in their triumphs and folleys. I felt like I had been on an adventure myself by the time I was through, and if you have yet to see this I wish you well on your adventure!",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMA:B) is a masterpiece, consistently voted as one of the best anime series and also as one of the best tv series of all time this amazing show definitely deserves those titles.
The story line of FMA:B is complex but understandable, it hits hard with some good old fashioned feels but it's also incredibly delicate and fine tuned which leaves you stunned for hours after the final credits roll.
The art of FMA:B is quite good for an older animation, beautiful backgrounds mixed with amazing fight scene animation and gorgeous detail make FMA:B some serious eye candy. The voice acting is fantastic and very
                  rarely falters.
But where I believe Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood really shines is in it's characters and the character development. Protagonist and antagonist alike are easy to fall in love with, each and every character feels unique and has there own strengths and weaknesses, no two characters are alike. The people in this show have there own original personalities and these all evolve beautifully over the span of the show, the like of which I have never seen before. The characters and the development of them cannot be understated in FMA:B
Overall Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is amazing and well rounded a fantastic story mixed with beautiful art and fantastic characters and development. I would highly recommend this anime.",10

                Definitely one of the best anime's out there, but I still put it just shy of THE best... Love just about everything in this anime and even the dubbed version is great to watch. It's extremely emotional and great action and I have no real complaints... 
In terms as to why I wouldn't give it a 10, I'd say mainly because there are area's it could have done better. The art quality could have been more distinct and original... the music could have been improved a bit to give it more presence... The fighting could have been more Hunter X Hunter style and focus more
                  on good tactics and detailed strategy rather than just a slice and dice until someone wins... 
But really, FMA:B didn't need any of these things, it would have just made it a little better...",9

                Ah Fullmetal Alchemist. The anime that officially got me started watching anime. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is it's sequel (or is it) and fixes every flaw that it's prequel had. 
There is a lot about FMA Brotherhood that makes me want to watch it. One if it is it's complex yet simple story. Two boys lose their bodies trying to bring back their mother so they try to get it back by studying alchemy. Easy, right. but there's so much more to FMA Brotherhood then just getting some bodies back. As this anime goes into more detail the viewer realizes everything in this anime works together
                  in some way. That's what makes the story so fascinating and watchable.  
Before I watched FMA I had no idea that there existed an anime company called Bones. Now I do and whatever they release I watch. Something special about Bones is their animation. The animation for FMA Brotherhood is meant to be the way it is. Bones did an amazing job in figuring out what works in this anime. 
There is a lot of different sounds in FMA Brotherhood. Some of them are repetitive, especially in fight scenes, but they never get old. There is also a lot of older types of music in this anime like 1930's jazz and waltz. 
Ed and Al are your main characters in this anime and if you watch this anime you will like either Ed or Al or both. I haven't met a person yet that hates both of them. Other character like Roy Mustang are also very amusing.
For me the enjoyment factor in this anime was great. I couldn't wait for the next episode to come out so I can watch it. I'm sure if your a person that loves shounen you will love this anime. And if your looking for an anime that is really in depth and is fast paced then you should definitely give this anime a go.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the anime that covers the events of the manga where as the previous anime branched off onto a different story line. What it definitely improves on is the pacing where the original anime felt rushed, this series seems to have paced out the events a lot better and it does not feel like they were trying to go through an entire story arc in the last couple of episodes. The events that occur help carry the story through. What ultimately harms it is that there are some things that are left unexplained and their answer is simply the power of the
                  human will or the power of the human soul.
One thing I really liked about this series was the art. At no point did it go through a strange art shift that made everything seem off and awkward. What I really liked though was the effects of objects created with alchemy. The characters often created objects with alchemy that had uneven patterns. At first I thought it was strange, then I figured out that it was a brilliant idea as it allowed you to distinguish the difference between some objects created with alchemy and objects that were created through other means.
The voices of the Japanese cast was very good. I never felt annoyed by their voices. One of the problems with this series is that the music was never something memorable for me. I remember the events and the characters of the story, but the music was always something that was in the background that I never took notice of. The sound matches nicely with the events and do not feel awkward at least.
The characters were great in this series and many of them were well developed. Nearly all of the major characters receive some sort of flashback that tells you more about them without killing them off. This helped a lot in the development of characters and establishing the atmosphere and motivations of characters in the series. It was done very well compared to some of the other series out there.
Overall, I felt that this series was pretty good for a Shounen series. Considering the amount of brainless overpowered main characters out there, this was one of the few that strayed a little from that formula in order to give us something different. Though the characters do suffer from a tragic past, the main characters rarely beat their opponents through brute force and willpower. We learn a lot about the primary villain and numerous characters receive a fair amount of screen time that helps develop the characters further.",9
"
                Jesus where do I begin,
First of all, the story is NOT the incredible masterpiece everybody claims it is. The characters are shallow and filled with tropes and gags that are repeated CONSTANTLY. The art is ok I guess but none of the fight scenes that are promised in the openings actually seem to happen in the show itself, and besides the occasional flashy 5 seconds at the end of a fight there isn't much happening in the fight scenes.
The story feels incredibly rushed at times, which is strange considering that this was studio Bones' second attempt at this show. The sound is the best part
                  of the show honestly as the sound effects are perfect, the voice acting is stellar, and the op and end themes are all bangers.
Overall I'm giving this show a 1 because not only is it seriously overrated; but it's also just not very good at all.",1

                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. The remake of Full metal Alchemist. If you have seen the first series you might be hesitant to start watching Brotherhood, mainly because you have already seen it. Which is not the point really.
I myself was hesitant about it. the first few episodes were almost the same as the original and i had almost dropped it but around episode 15 if i recall right. Brotherhood kicks it up and takes on a different story then the original. A much better one. If you watch one episode you'll keep watching.
I would also like to point out some things about the art, sound, characters
                  and overall again. 
Art: 
The details that are drawn especially of the faces are magnificent, they captivate those certain emotions, and it looks badass. 
Only seeing the art is already an enjoyment in itself. 
Sound:
Great really great, very realistic voice acting and some sad moments brought me to the brink of tears, also due to the sound being played. 
Characters: 
Very good, some awesome unique characters. i would almost say that all characters of this series could be a favorite. I like all characters in this series and everyone is different. there may be some that i dislike but it's none of the main characters/sub-main characters.
Overall:
It has a hint of romance, action, adventure AWESOME animation. oustanding art. And a mastermind writer. The story is a diamond amongst diamonds. 
The start was not that great for me due to already having watched the first series. But when it starts it won't stop and every episode is the very definition of f****** epic. 
One final thing, after watching brotherhood i gave the original an 8 instead of 10. and seeing brotherhood all the way through and comparing it with the original wants me to give the original a 6 or 7. of all the 100+ anime i've seen this takes the crown without breaking a sweat.",10
"
                This is one of the few shows that I can give a flat 10/10 in every category. I know that by including this anime and NOT the original FMA anime in my list, I am choosing a side in the ever raging battle of FMA vs Brotherhood. 
I haven't finished watching the original FMA (I dropped it) but from what little I experienced when I saw that compared to Brotherhood, I have to say that Brotherhood did a much better job at keeping me entertained. The flow of the story along with the character development feels organic as supposed to FMA where sometimes certain characters
                  felt as if they were forced into the scenario and their presence or absence did not make much of a difference to the overall plot. 
Brotherhood's pacing, along with its animation style, voice acting and soundtrack make it perhaps one of the best anime ever created. Also, to answer the Sub vs Dub question, the Dub is (in my opinion) BETTER. And again, Brotherhood is one of only two shows that I can attribute this to (The other one being DBZ).
If you love anime and haven't seen this then you're losing out on serious cred.",10
"
                Realizing he was a newly born infant in the world of weebs and therefore, a casual scrub, he sought help from his only friend that knew such a mystical world: MAL. He searched frantically though MAL to find what were the true gems in the cavern of anime. Not knowing any better, he used MAL's rating system of popularity and scores to choose what he thought were the best of the best. He struck gold several times with gems like Steins;Gate but also found stones with deceiving luster and zero value like Toradora. However, it was not until a year after he began his journey
                  that he decided to mine for the proclaimed crown of the MAL rating ladder: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. And oh boy. He, or rather I, wasn't that impressed.
As the highest rated series on MAL, I had some expectations for this show even though MAL scores don't mean that much. I have not seen the original FMA or read the manga, but after watching FMAB, I don't really plan to. FMAB is just a nice show to binge if you have nothing better to do.
Pros
There are really no glaring flaws with the show. The plot was engaging for the first third and decent for the the rest. All the major characters have interesting traits and backgrounds. The art style is unique, and the animation is solid for the most part. The OST is pretty good.
Cons
Even though the show has no low points, there are really no real high points ever. It's kinda of just a flatline for a majority of it. If someone were to ask me ""What's your favorite part of FMAB?"", I'd literally say nothing. Everything is serviceable. It checked off all the marks for the most crowd pleasing show. It is a longish shounen show, but I don't think that's really an excuse. HxH isn't my favorite show of all time or even a personal favorite, but at least I can say I really enjoyed some of the fights and a few characters. In FMAB, I can't say that. I would assume many people would respond, ""What do you mean? I loved everything about FMAB! Everything about that show is perfect!"" But after like ep 20 or something, I just wanted it to end. The main antagonist is kinda dull, the fight scenes are ok, the themes are fairly generic, the comedy is just there for the sake of comedic relief and not actually funny, and in general, everything is kinda just there.
To re-clarify, this show is definitely not bad. But does something with no flaws immediately make it a masterpiece? Definitely not. I'm sure if you're actually reading this and debating whether to watch FMAB, you'll might just watch it out of curiosity like I did. And if you love it to death, then great! But for me, it was just an ok and ultimately forgettable show.",6

                The original Fullmetal Alchemist anime was one of the first anime series I ever watched. I remember seeing glimpses of it when I was younger, but the story did not pull me in or appeal to me as much as Inuyasha did at the time. It was years later, when I was thirteen, that I finally did watch it and I fell in love. However, at the time, I didn't have much to compare it to, having never read the manga. When I heard that Brotherhood was coming out, I rushed off to read the manga and got up-to-date with it before Brotherhood started and
                  continued to stay up-to-date on both the manga and Brotherhood. 
Two years after these have both ended, I have re-watched the series several times, and every time I rewatch it, it never loses any appeal nor do I ever find any serious faults with it. It's a wonderful story of love and loss, pain and grief, family and friendship and put together, it makes for a very touching and compelling story about two brothers who attempt to make the best of a situation they brought on themselves by performing human transmutation as well as regain what they have lost as a result. Coupled with a wide variety of characters, all amazing in their own way, it makes for a truly amazing tale that can have you laughing one moment and crying the next. 
I've read many conflicting views on both series; some say there was little to no character development in Brotherhood as compared to the original, others say Brotherhood moved too fast and wasn't as a deep of a story. I personally prefer Brotherhood to the original and here is why:
Edward Elric seems a lot more grown up in Brotherhood. In the original (now that I've seen Brotherhood and can compare the two), he is a bit whiny and annoying. My personal favorite character is the homunculus Envy, as disliked of a character he is, I believe he is a much deeper and well-developed character than he is given credit for in both series. Brotherhood's storyline seems much more thought-out and in the end, it has a much deeper message than the original. 
The first few episodes of Brotherhood are covering what happened in the original up to the point where it diverged from the manga and while it is rushed, I was okay with it because I wouldn't want to sit through ~30 episodes of stuff I have already seen. I feel that even though it was rushed, it got the story across just as effectively, not to mention it left more room for the plot to unfold and progress at a more natural pace. I also think the animation is lot better and more appealing to look at. 
The story has a great ending whereas with the original, you had to watch the movie Conqueror of Shamballa to get some real closure. I do believe that some characters in Brotherhood were killed off too soon and could have received more character development - a particular homunculus being a prime example, if you've seen the anime already I'm pretty sure you'll know who but I'm trying not to be spoilery.
But in the end, I wholeheartedly believe Brotherhood far surpasses the original and the original hardly even compares. I recommend that everyone watches both, but don't be surprised if you end up preferring Brotherhood.",10
"
                This is probably an actual enjoyable anime in a way the story was pretty alright kind of mediocre compared to my expectations the only solution to which it may be able to reach the requirements of my expectations is if they added a little bit more unpredicatbility some plot twists and thickening and then it will probably reach atleast a 5. The animation was pretty poor only 1 good fight and the art as was not my cup of tea. The characters are not hot at all and sometimes kind of stupid. The sound design is basic and bland too and the overall anime was
                  below mid. Very overrated
Conclusion: Probably a good anime for normies but true anime enthusiasts wouldn't appreciate something like this. I would only recommend this to my 3 year old brother",1
"
                I absolutely adore this show. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a series that I'll never get tired of. The characters, the plot, the fights, all of it is timeless in my eyes.
The story is something I feel is very untouched, especially since the plot revolves around an actual type of science. The beginning three or four episodes may feel a bit rushed to some viewers but eventually it slows down to a pace where significant progress is made each episode with very well done pacing. Almost everything in this show foreshadows something else to come, weather it just be a quote or something a character observes.
                  There are so many twists and turns that it's near impossible to guess what's going to happen. They give you just the right amount of information to create a well written mystery.
Of course a well written story isn't much if the characters in it aren't also well written. Fortunately the characters in this show are all memorable and interesting, in many different aspects. Something at this show does especially well is villains. Each of the main villains are all so different and intimidating in their own ways. While one villain's size is terrifying, as a contrast another one is just as, if not more, intimidating by simply being in a room with the main protagonists. The overall antagonist in this series is one of my favorites in all of anime. The intelligence, the power, the mystery, this is an all around great main villain. The heroes in this series are also very well written. The development of some takes over half the show to be even close to be complete, and it all pays off to create amazing co-stars. Taking a look at the main protagonists, the Elric Brothers, these are easily two of the best siblings in anime as well as other genres of television. There is a very strong and believable family relationship between them in many more ways than one. One character that outdoes the two brothers in terms of being well written is none other than their own father, Hohenhiem. Just saying one thing about his past would soil his character arc. Overall each character is original and believable in their own way, staying away from repetitious arcs such as ""someone died, now I'm evil"" with one exception, which is developed and improved dramatically. Everyone has a drive, some simple, some complex, but all of them well done.
The art style is very beautiful, especially the locations such as Resembool and Fort Briggs. Color plays a key role in setting mood in this sometimes very dark and grotesque world. Lighting is very dynamic, showing very strong shadows for characters going through certain arcs and parts of life. The characters all have different looks and clothing making them easily distinguishable. There are however occasional quality drops but towards the end of the series these are very scarce. Music is also a very nice tone setting element with each song sounding like an orchestral piece. Some of these songs do get repeated quite a few times but if you're watching the show for your first time I can't see it being too noticeable or annoying. Many of the sound effects fit very well with situations and often give scenes that extra push, weather it be dramatic or silly. The official Funimation dub of this show is one of their best in my opinions. If you don't enjoy dubs, that's fine, but I suggest if you do try only one, try this one.
The flaws of this series often resolve themselves over time. The true momentum of this show, where I found myself not wanting the episodes to end, was about episode 25. That's not to say anything before that isn't as good, that's just the point where I began to watch until I could barely hold my eyes open. I would love to give this show a perfect ten, but I will say it has it's flaws, few they may be. This is my favorite anime of all and I strongly suggest it to anyone who likes mystery, strong characters, and great fight scenes.",9
"
                Before watching this anime i hadn't watched any other anime's, so I had nothing to compare it to. But after watching the first episode i was immediately hooked and couldn't get enough.
The story is fantastic leaving you wanting to see more. It also doesn't give too much away too quickly leaving the viewer excited to find out what will happen next. The characters are also easily liked and they all added to the experience. As for the art style it didn't look outdated and sound was used carefully.
From my experience i feel this is a great anime to start with for someone who has seen
                  little or no anime before. But even hardcore anime fans should give this a go.",10
"
                Excuse the long review, and keep in mind this is my first
-----------
A few years ago in my freshman year of college, I had a number of friends who were extremely into anime. Other than watching a little bit of Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Naruto as a kid, I had little familiarity with anime. I proceeded to watch a few Miyazaki classics, and then FMA:B as my first ""serious"" anime series with. So understand that this rave review is partially due to nostalgia from those days, and you may not think it is as good as I do for that reason. Nonetheless, I probably should've started with
                  a different anime, because after watching FMA:B it is extremely difficult to find anything that compares.
As you can tell from the synopsis, the plot is incredibly original. But the synopsis doesn't quite tell you how deep the plot runs as it deals with some heavy and dark themes. It is all delivered with brilliant execution that has you on the edge of your seat for the entirety of the series, especially after the first fifteen episodes or so. Though the pacing is a little fast at times  (especially at first, though this is mostly because it is assumed the viewer has seen the original first or has some familiarity with the manga), there is very little to complain about.
As it is a remake of another series, it is difficult to write a review without comparisons. First of all, I would recommend seeing the original first; I did not and I missed a few details in my first viewing of the series (I have since rewatched a few times after watching the original). It is not absolutely necessary to watch the original and Brotherhood certainly can stand on its own, but it does help a little to be at least familiar with the original. 
Brotherhood starts out largely the same as the original series (and the manga), though paced a little faster. For various reasons, largely because of the slower pace and better character development, I prefer the beginning of the original series. After episode ten or so, Brotherhood goes off in a very different direction from the original to better follow the manga. This is where I begin to significantly prefer brotherhood as it thematically covers far more ground and develops a number of the other characters in a superior way (most notably Scar, Envy, Edward, Mustang, and Wrath). Edward, especially, is far more dynamic in Brotherhood and has a better connection to the theme of the show. While the original dealt more exclusively with the ethical implications and nature of human equality, Brotherhood deals with those themes more subtlety as well as the fallibility of human knowledge, cultural and philosophic differences between the East and West, the brutal nature of war, the ethics of retributive justice, and the role of science and religion in the formation of ethics. All of these themes are dealt with in a common thread of deep humanism, and the ending is more complete and more satisfying than the original. I could go on for days about the numerous thought provoking themes this anime delivers, but I won't and it's really impossible to do justice to the plot in this review. I give it a 10/10 for plot.
When it comes to art, Brotherhood is slightly better animated than the original, mostly because of technological advances between 2003 and 2009. Though the animation isn't the best feature of this anime and is hardly the best Studio Bones has produced (that honor going to Sword of the Stranger), it is still substantially above average. What really artistically stands out about FMA:B is the directing style. Though it is action-heavy like most shounen anime, it avoids all of the pitfalls of the genre. There’s no campy battle cries, the battle scenes (if you can even call them that) are actually well directed and not action-for-the-sake of action, everything isn’t immediately explained to the viewer by the participants in the battle, and the points of interest are not the battle scenes in the first place or even the powers the characters have through alchemy--but the quiet scenes where the characters reflect on their situation. It is the only shounen (other than perhaps the original) I’ve seen that I could call cerebral and reflective. There are a number of fascinating camera shots and interesting directing decisions throughout the series. For example, the way the entire end scene of  the episode “Backs in the Distance” is directed is some of the best cinematography one can ask for (you’ll know what I mean when you see it). Though there are a couple moments, especially near the beginning, where the atmosphere of the anime is a little tainted by some childish humor and over-done jokes about Ed’s height (it’s easy to forget amongst all the genocide and references to classical epistemology that this was marketed to a younger audience), it is overall very well directed.  It gets a 9/10 for art.
When it comes to sound, there’s a bit of a dilemma here. It may be a controversial opinion, but this (and the original) is the absolute only case where I prefer the dub to the sub. Ed’s voice in the sub sounds like a stereotypical and--to be honest--a little annoying shounen protaganist that does not do justice to the depth of his character, and Alphonse just comes off as whiny in the sub, almost reminiscent of a uke in a bad yaoi. Other than that, the sub is decent and doesn’t really detract from the series overall; but the dub is where this anime really shines. Vic Mignogna does a brilliant job as Edward Elric, and the rest of the cast, with a few exceptions, act very well.
The soundtrack also bears worth mentioning. I actually paid $50 plus shipping from Japan to the US to buy this soundtrack, that is how good it is. I listen to it quite a bit and many of the tracks are beautiful and match the scenes they are put in perfectly. This is among the best OSTs for anime you will find out there, and even overshadows some of the elements I do not like  at the sub. That said, the OST probably could’ve used a bit more tracks as it gets a little repetitive towards the end. For this reason, I give it a 9/10 for sound.
The characters in this anime are also extremely well done. Almost all the major characters are highly dynamic with deep back stories, and even the more minor characters are highly likeable and contribute significantly to the plot, with a few exceptions. And the connections between this anime’s intricate plot and deep themes and the characters go well beyond what almost any other anime does. Most of the characters are also vehicles for symbolism. Brotherhood goes far beyond being good in the department of character symbolism, and ventures into being an exemplar of what anime can be as an artform. 10/10 for characters.
Clearly, given the way I’ve been raving about it and the fact that I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve rewatched it (I’d guess around six), it’s fair to say that I think this anime is enjoyable. And not just enjoyable in the sense of entertaining (though it certainly is) or even enjoyable in the sense that you tend to lose yourself in the story (though you certainly do), but it is enjoyable in the sense of being completely enlightening thematically, as I’ve said before. If you want to think deeply about an anime, look no further than brotherhood. I even went as far as to use brotherhood in a college paper to illustrate some philosophical implications of Richard Rorty’s rejection of Cartesianism (granted, it was for a seminar on anime). Even if you don’t really want to think about an anime intellectually, it is enjoyable just for the sake of being a good story that you can lose yourself into. Whether you want a deep thoughtful anime, an action-packed shounen that you can get excited about, or just a good story to simply enjoy for its own sake, Brotherhood delivers. I typically use it as the go to to introduce newcomers to anime, and as you can see from its place in the rankings, it is much beloved by the most experienced of anime viewers. 10/10 for enjoyment.
As of the writing of this review, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood sits at number two overall on the MAL list, and has historically taken the number one spot on many occasions (and probably will again in the future). If you haven't seen this before, then, you are probably approaching it with extremely high expectations. Typically when people approach a show with that high of expectations, they are disappointed. FMA:B is an exception to this. It competes for my absolute favorite anime, and tops the favorite lists of many others, for a very good reason. Call me an otaku fanboy, but I can’t rave about it enough. There are only two animes I’ve ever seen that I’ve given a 10/10, and this is one of them.",10
"
                After losing their mother, two young boys commit their world's most taboo act; trying to revive the dead. This costs the older brother his left leg, and the younger brother his entire being. The older brother sacrifices his right arm to bind the younger's soul to a suit of armor. Their experiment fails, and the thing they create in the act is nothing short of a monster.
Determined to find a way to get their bodies, the older brother replaces his missing limbs with mechanical substitutes and signs up with the military, as a soldier. Thus begins a journey into the hallowed secrets of alchemy, and
                  the schemes that resulted in the nation they serve.
This is the premise of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I feel that I should take the time right now to establish a few key points about this review. Brotherhood's English dub has not been fully released yet, and I do not generally enjoy watching a series in Japanese for various reasons. That said, while I did watch the latter half of Brotherhood in Japanese, I won't comment on the Japanese voice actors; I do not understand the language enough to truly grasp the emotion and meaning set behind actual words, and the only thing I have to go off of is the fansub group's interpretation of what characters were saying.
Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about Brotherhood. The plot of the show spans so many characters that it's a testament to the ability of the writers that they were able to keep consistency throughout the astounding and wonderful plot.
The show takes place in a fictional nation called Amestris, a place fully realized from top to bottom. Every territory's similarities to one another, and their differences, are intricately designed, and conveyed through actions, visuals, and dialogue, without ever being explicitly stated or exposited. But not just Amestris; at least two other nations are given screen time, and even one nation we never actually see, are conveyed as so different from Amestris, and yet it's clear that they're all in the same world.
Setting is great, but the characters are what make Brotherhood truly shine. I could go on about each of them individually, probably for hours on end. Each and every supporting character has their own story told, without ever dragging or detracting from the main plot of the series. Everything is woven together seamlessly, from beginning to end. The viewer is in the dark for most of the villain's plans and doings for most of the series, but by the end, it all makes perfect sense, and again, this is achieved without ever having the villains simply go on a ten minute monologue explaining everything.
Every minute of the series is spent developing characters, advancing the plot, and showing the audience what they should know when they should know it, all at the same time. Even the slowest parts of the series are kept fascinating throughout.
The English dub is being produced by FUNimation, with most of the VAs from the original Full Metal Alchemist series reprising their roles. At the time of writing this review, the English dub is not yet complete, and there are still some characters yet to be voiced, but from the first thirty-nine episodes, unless everyone absolutely drops the ball for the latter half of the show, I am confident in saying that the dub is fantastic. Every character is brought to life through a combination of excellent writing and acting, and it's difficult to tell which of the two is doing more to make them believable.
Mood and tone are very important in that as well. From all the praise I've been giving the series so far, it should come as no surprise that the soundtrack is beautifully composed and employed exquisitely.
Everything I've mentioned so far has been fantastic. So what about the low points of the series? What's done poorly? Nothing at all. Every plot thread culminates into something spectacular, no character is forgotten, and everything else is simply amazing. The only real criticism I could think of for the series is that ""science"" basically means ""magic,"" but even that doesn't detract from the series being astounding.
Wonderfully paced, masterfully told, and expertly written, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is as close to a perfect anime as any of us will see for a very long time. I five it a five out of five, and a huge recommendation to anyone and everyone.",10

                --The review contains spoilers--
I've been recommended FMAB by almost everyone I know, and it really hurts me to say that I just don't get it.
I probably have more to say, but here's a brief summary, sorry if this pisses off any fanboys.
The good:
It's beautifully animated, and the music is incredible. While I got tired of the little animation gags they did, the fights were so good it made up for it entirely. The score, like I said, was amazing, really loved it. Also there are some good characters and solid episodes. The bad:
First, it's kind of boring. I honestly just didn't really get engaged in the show until part 4, then it immediately got boring again. The only episodes I was really engaged in was the Ling, Wrath, and Hohenheim episodes, and those were few and far between. 
This brings me to my second issue, the characters. Personally, Ed and Al are some of my least favorite protagonists of all time. I'll try not to get into too many spoilers but they pretty quickly run out of motivation once the truth of the philosopher's stone was revealed, so then they story controls them rather than the other way around. This is really important especially in the ending, when it's revealed that the fight they think they're fighting has been going on for literal thousands of years and Hohenheim already has many contingencies in place. Other characters like Scar and Kimblee are also super cool, but totally wasted as they don't end up mattering AT ALL in the larger story.
Finally, I don't understand the universe. They claim it's all about equivalent exchange, but it's never explained how characters can just make stuff, like Mustang can just make fire, or Scar can just destroy stuff. Even if you can explain that, why are there even different types of Alchemy, why does flame alchemy exist, and if it does, why can't Edward do it. Other than not needing a circle, is Edward actually special? I was just constantly confused by the power system and different types of alchemy, despite them all being the same. 
Overall, it's okay. I like some of the characters (Ling, Greed, Wrath), and again the animation alone maybe makes it worth watching. However, the story and the protagonists just didn't do it for me. I know it technically reaches into deeper themes of truth and loss and whatever, but like I said, it reaches. The story isn't good enough to actually be deep, it just feels like it's trying too hard and not actually making a story worth watching.",5

                Fullmetal Alchemist fans are a lucky bunch. Not only did they score one television anime based (for the most part) on Hiromu Arakawa's amazing manga series, but the same studio who made that one, Bones, decided to later do an even longer series based even closer to the manga. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was one of those things that I thought was just going to be summarily dismissed as a novelty for the manga readers. I personally didn't care whether there was an accurate version of the manga in anime form. I loved (and still love) the first series and movie, and if I want the
                  manga's story, I can read the manga. Fortunately, Brotherhood was damn good enough to keep watching from beginning to end, and it isn't necessarily because this show is significantly superior to the first (it isn't at all), but because it's just a very good show in itself. 
So, basically, the story is a quest of restoration. The Elric brothers lost their bodies and are looking for a way to regain those things. The journey of the Elrics takes them to various places, meeting various people, and with various plot twists and turns, ultimately leading them to the final confrontation with said Big Bad, and somehow regaining (most of) what they lost. 
My one objection to the treatment of the narrative is that, much like in the original manga, it relies on these big sensational ""moments"", which are cool to read/watch, but ultimately take away from the verisimilitude of the work as a whole. All you end up getting are a bunch of puncuations that take away from the subtlety of the themes. 
For the most part, we get a variety of interesting, and examined characters. The short-tempered but honest Edward and his more composed brother Alphonse. The ambitious and snarky Roy Mustang. His loyal subordinates. The over-the-top, larger-than-life Alex Louis Armstrong and his vicious, tough-as-nails older sister, Olivier Mira Armstrong. The affable, but wicked Greed (my favorite character). The king of trolls, Envy. The badassery-oozing-from-every-pore King Bradley. The adorable May. The butt monkey Yoki. The distant father with the weight of the world on his shoulders, Hohenheim. Some great characters. 
The art and animation in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is pretty good, and what one would expect of an anime of this generation. The character designs are much closer to Hiromu Arakawa's art in Brotherhood than they were in the original series. The backgrounds and foregrounds can be quite beautiful, if oddly like watercolor paintings at times.The animation is mostly pretty good, though there are times when it noticeably isn't, and it's pretty clear certain episodes have a much higher quality animation than others. 
A large part of bringing the characters alive in an animated television series or movie is the voice acting. In the manga, you just imagine the voices, but in animation, voices are provided, and ideally, these are voices that you will closely associate with the characters, so a strong cast is valuable. Fortunately, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has an excellent cast.
The music in this series is excellent. Senju makes use of sprawling, almost pastoral, European-sounding tracks, establishing leitmotifs and conjuring up very operatic pieces for the most dramatic moments in the series.
It's not a flawless series, mind you. It seems overly drawn out at times, there are a few plot snags, some characters I don't care for, and adaptation missteps (Dublith/Greed arc, the Ishbal massacre). But, on the whole, looking at the big picture, it's absolutely more than just the sum of its parts",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who lose possession of their bodies as a result of breaking the most important rule in alchemy, attempting to resurrect the dead, and they journey across the country of Amestria as they attempt to reclaim their former selves. Edward Elric is this anime's protagonist, the famed ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" whose legendary reputation is rivaled by his alchemical skills, the wise cracking prodigy with an unpredictable personality and a strong distaste for milk, and the height-conscious adolescent with a constant inner conflict about morality, a massive amount of confidence, and an unwavering dedication to his loved
                  ones. If I were to make a list of the greatest anime characters, Edward Elric would be in at least the top ten. Alphonse Elric is the younger of the two brothers, a gentle and likable young boy trapped in a suit of armor that serves as Edward's mediator during Ed's explosive episodes (Al is often assumed to be the older of the two due to his height). Brotherhood ventures into a variety of places throughout Amestria, from the bustling business environment in Central City to the fear-inducing tunnels underneath the city, from the wind-driven snowflakes covering the Drachma region to the primal adobes in dust-consumed Ishval, and, in all of them, this anime crafts the setting with a razor-sharp eye for detail and an amazingly artistic flair.
The majority of FMA Brotherhood doesn't focus on the Elric brothers but instead on the people surrounding them. Colonel Roy Mustang is my favorite character, an easygoing alchemist with the coolest power ever (He can unleash fire by – get this! – snapping his fingers!), and an ambitious leader that alternates between cracking jokes and being dangerously serious. There's Winry Rockbell, a childhood friend of the Elric brothers and a gifted mechanic. There's Scar, a sunglasses-wearing Ishvalan with a reputation as a malicious murderer and a mission to destroy alchemists of the military via alchemy. Brotherhood also contains a great group of villains in the Homunculi, the seven nearly-unstoppable immortal-like beings each with their own unique personality, and their Father. The two Homunculi that stood out to me were Greed (The Homunculi are named after the seven deadly sins), a rebellious man with steel-like skin, and Pride. Born from Nightmare Fuel, Pride is this anime's most important villain excluding the main antagonist Father who I will remember most for that frightening scene with Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye. Excluding the emotionless Father, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has characters with great acting, emotion, complexity, and (above all) likability (Is this even a word?)
There are five main themes in Brotherhood; the final opening is by far the most emotional, but my favorite is the first, a fast-paced theme song that slowly intensifies at a pace with the opening's singer. Plotwise, there isn't a big difference in Brotherhood from the Fullmetal manga (although Isaac the Freezer never graced the FMA pages nor did Father Cornello evolve into a hulking beast), but the anime is still just as good, with more twists than a Twizzler stick and more energy than a kid on a sugar rush.
Perhaps the greatest thing about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is its appeal to all genres. If you want tons of action, if you want a show with martial arts, if you want a military-themed anime, if you want some mystery to your show, if you want some sci-fi in your show, if you want a huge focus on adventure in your show, if you want some slice-of-life aspects to your anime, if you want to see buckets of blood, if you want to watch a show with fantasy elements in it, if you want to watch a dystopia-themed show, if you want to check out an anime with depth, then Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the series for you.

                Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood was on my list for a while and since Funi was losing their streaming rights to the series I thought I take my opportunity to binge watch it. Overall its a pretty good series that stuck to its guns when trying to focus on the story while handling many characters. 
Story 10/10
The story of FMA can be sometimes really lighthearted and warm where you have scenes of comedy and happiness while the other half of the story some things are very dark. I watched the first few episodes of the series with a cousin who stopped watching cause he couldn't handle
                  a certain dark scene that has been referenced in various FMA and anime memes (You people of the internet probably know what I am talking about). The best part about this story which is the main reason I give the story a ten out of ten review is because it feels complete where it stopped where everything finished. 
Art 9/10 & Sound 9/10
The Art of the series was pretty good I cant really say much about it as most of the best parts of the animation where various scenes where alchemy is used. The music also used in various scenes throughout the show make the alchemy scenes feel more epic to watch. 
Characters 10/10
The Characters both major and supporting all have some role in the series that gives them a purpose to be in the series which a lot of series fail to do. You have the brothers who are pretty much the personification of brotherhood which is seen through their interactions. Some of the villains you find in the series can make your blood boil but when they are defeated you cant help but pity them. The supporting characters that have nothing to do with the Elric brothers in the first place all get some decent character development that makes you like them as the story progresses even in the last season and a half of the show.  
Enjoyment 10/10
I really enjoyed this series and it is good for anyone who wants to watch a full series in their spare time rather then watch something and wait a month or a year for a continuation.",10
"
                I give this Anime the ultimate score, i could not find ANYTHING wrong with it.  The story, the characters, the animation even the music...it is all of an unbelievable beauty.  Extra kudos to the artwork i have to say, this looks amazing, each episode amazed me. This level of fluid animation u usually only see in the big budget Anime movies.  
I think anybody can enjoy this, it has action in it, but also a lot of emotion.  Nothing more needs to be said, if you have not seen this yet, watch it...asap.  btw, the Brotherhood version is a remake
                  from the original FMA, and it has to be said, it must have been a wet dream for the FMA fans, as it improves an allready good show in every possible way and makes it one of THE top anime shows of all time.",10

                Like I've already said in some of my other review, I'm not at my best, when I'm reviewing something, that I like... or love, for that matter! Maybe because, when you usually review something you love, you tend to overhype it, drooling all over it, like a rapid dog, and when someone, like me, tends to take that overhyping for granted, it can really, really easily backfire. To me, it's just so much more easier to say, why I hate something, rathen than why I love, but if I have to tell, why I love something, it's usually just something like ""meh... because!"" Not very
                  solid argument, I know, but lets just see, how do I manage this time, shall we?!
Story (10)
The story - in a nutshell, because there's a lot! - is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse, who study alchemy, since their deadbeat-father left them out of nowhere, without mentioning when or never to return. Their mother dies, so logically, they try to bring her back... which would be all and good, if it wasn't such a taboo! So big of a taboo in fact, that the older brother looses his arm and a leg, and the other his entire body - symbolism, everywhere! With no other choise left but to ""stand up and go further"", they burn down their house, join in the military, and start their hunt in search of a legendary Philosophers stone, that can in any hands do pretty much anything, even beyond the laws of nature, equivalent exchange, or even the God himself! All in the same time, when the military and the mysterious group of renegades called Homunculi plot their way up in the circles, all waiting the Promised Day to arrive, and end the world as they know it! 
What is the secret behind the Philosopher's stone, and the Isvalan civil war? What is this Promised Day, and what it means to be called a ""sacrivice""? Who plots against who and who stands to gain immortality? All this and more, in about 60-episodes- long rollercoaster of deceat, vengeance, and hope for a happy ending!
When I first saw this anime, I've already seen the ""original"" older version, and didn't like it... as much! I thought it was clumsy, little jumpy with the story department, and the characters... well, they were there. That's all. Nothing really solid there, but I won't complain. Overall, I wasn't that hyped, to see this newer, bigger and more costly ""remake"", that's supposed to follow the original manga much more loyally... and knowing, what the remakes usually do to our beloved movies, this could've been really big hit or miss! Lucky for me... I really loved it! The story really was great, with deeper themes, following so many sidestories, characters' backstories and motivations, that I actually felt like drowning into everyhting, that I was exposed to... and this anime is only about 60 episodes long! God damn!
What I was so impressed about this anime, whas that it actually was relatively deep, both for a story, and the characters, and do I even dare to say... somewhat complex at a times - it took me actually three rewaches to get a good grip of the sidestories, main plot, and motivations, understandin fully every single character, and what they're ""mind-frames"" really were! 
That being said, the plot itself is still relatively simple, but the way it's told, is not! There are so many elements, and plotpoints, that it's almost hard to tell, where the actual story is, and when do all these little pieces get put together - like a awesome 3D-puzzle! But, when it does get put together, it's just so satisfactory, that it feels like... well, it feels! Questions about live and death, teology and humans' real place in the world, what you can wish for, and what you can actually have, without breaking the boundaries you're not granted to brake, what's the true price of desires, and is there really some things in this world, that should stay forbidden, untainted by humans greedy hands? These are just a scrach on the surface of many, many themes this anime has to offer, and I can't wait, to find out even more!
Art (9)
The art... while still not my strongest forte in my judgement-stand-point, is still pretty impressive, and pretty to look at. The backgrounds are clear and simple, yet immaginative enough to belong into this steam-punk- ish, so-so historic version of Germany in WWII, which really was a big selling-point for me, who just absolutely loves history.
The characters are all simple, yet easy too tell apart. They don't all have the same faces, nor all-too-similar facial expressions, which seems to be my new pet peeve in anime in regular. 
The fights - yes, there's fighting involved in this anime... surprise! - are very detailed and the animation compiments beautifully each characters own personalities, abilities and what are their strongest points. For example, Ed is pretty talented fighter in general, but tends to ""overheat"" if being called ""shortie"". Al is much more composed, but too gentle most of the times. The homunculi are my absolute favourite to watch, since they all have different abilites, and they all use them with precise, and with deadly talent, that's just a bliss to look at!
There are still easily seen some brief, yet noticeable moments of changed animation styles, expecially during fighting. The movements tend to lack the same fluidity as it normally has, and be thus overly exaggerated, but those are just a very brief moments here and there, mostly in the second half of the series, so it gets a pass from me.
Sound (9)
Althoug I did watch the original Fullmetal Alchemist in english dub, I can't really say anything for it, or against it. It was nice, and had a solid talent behind it, but... since I watched this one in japanese... I just can't but to notice the difference! 
I just loved the voices in japanese! Japanese Kimbley is great, even if I have to loose Chris Sabat as a Armstrong.
I also loved the music, with it's oh-so melancholic choirs and violins, bringin out the emotions and the power of every scene and every character so perfectly, that I can't but to listen, and enjoy!
Character (10)
The characters - and o'boy there are tons! - aren't just some easy stereotypes, or shallow cardboard cut-outs, with little to no personality, or no actual motivations. These are real people, with real desires, flaws and sins to bear, with deep emotions and motivations, both in good and in bad. 
And the best part is, that it's not just the story, that gets to know them, but also we, who get to hear their thoughts, their memories and ambitions in life, like if they're talking with us, and I just love, when characters do that! You see their backstories, you hear their thoughts, their reasonings for their actions, and their points of views about situations, siding either with them, or against them. None of them are crystal clear, or pure white, and often times, I felt like watching actual real-life people, dealing with their pasts, sins, desires and flaws, rather than some fictional characters, bound in some unexplained contraption of plotpoints and events. They took their time to talk to me, to show me sides of themselves that I didn't know of, or didn't really want to learn of... but that's human for you - we all have sides in ourselves, that are both beautiful, and ugly, because we have something, called dimensions! These characters know both their own, and each others flaws, strenghts, ambitions and sins, therefore acting like a real individuals, being either hero, or a villain! 
And since we're already in the subject, I may as well say a thing or two about the... romances, in this anime. Yes, there're romances in this anime, and they're actually good ones! Romance in general, has never been that one ship that holds that much water in shounen... or, in anything even slightly japanese in that matter... but when it comes to FMA:B, the romance-angle is actually pretty good... even enjoyable! And I'm not even talking about the ""sappy/sugary/over-the-top""- romance either! I'm talking about the bonds between friends, loyalty between the master and the servants, and love between brothers, what's actually the main force of the story itself. The ever-so-subtle ""loyal-admiration""- angle with Hawkeye and Mustang was truly memorable, same as the friendship between Musty and Huges, as well as the romance between Ed and Winry, that blooms and developes the same way as the characters grow and develope. Nothing is rushed or paisted on top to look more pretty to the eyes of the viewer. It's all very well done, in the sence that it's not so over the top -they never say that they love each other, but you can still feel and see that they do! 
And what about the villains then? My all time favourite thriving force of any media or story-telling, that keeps me - if done right! - at the edge of my seat, begging for more and... well, let's leave it to that, shall we! The villains in this pick are also very enjoyable and well made, although the show itself do suffers that glorious ""too many characters at the same time!""- syndrome, so that not so many chracters get their time of the day to really shine and develope as the rest of the main cast does, but the thing is, that not all of them truly even need to develope - Gluttony or Sloth, although nice in general, not really that interesting to look at. Those who do get their time in the spotlight - Kimbley, Scar, some of the Homunculi and Father, for example - do get their own backstory, motivations and their own little arcs to fulfill, some of them even growing and developing along the way. It's truly a treat to look at, and therefore I wouldn't have said a bad word if the show itself was actually... say, ten episodes longer than it was, but oh well... never please the fans - they're the worst!
Kudos for the sublety though, since every single detail, action and mistake counts to something, developing both story and the characters, giving them even more motivation, and depth, through both stakes, and consequenses - when someone dies, they stay there... for good!
Enjoyment (10)
Despite all the things and points that impressed me, this is clearly not a anime for everybody! The story, although actually relatively simple, is really so heavily and tightly packed with themes, philosophy, subplots and multi-colored characters with each of their own motivations and stories, that it's really easy to get lost in the middle of it all, and loose interest as a whole - good memory, and good attention span are needed! 
Those, who enjoy investing themselves into a deep, rather long and character/plot-driven story, that forces you to think on your own and play that ""puzzle inside your brain""- game, can indeed find this anime rather interesting, maybe even marvelous, but do bear in mind, that there's some boobs here and there, and some of the asses are being slapped for the fun of it, so if that puts you off, then better either steel yourself, or look away - it is the military, after all! 
If you think, that the shows like Pokemon, DBZ or Little Snow Fairy Sugar are as deep of a storytelling and characterization as you can handle, don't even bother with this one!
Overall (10)
This anime is for those, who can appreciate deep, heavily multi-branched stories and plots, complex and colourful characters you actually get to know, and themes that'll actually make you think on your own - and it's actually not that long either, so... that helps too! The musics are amazing, and the art isn't that bad either, so if you're interested to give it a go, go for it, and enjoy the ride!",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of them most exciting and refreshing anime I have seen in a long time. It is a classic.
Review:
Story 10/10
The story revolves around two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric as they both go on  a journey to get their bodies back after trying to bring back their deceased mother using alchemy. They travel several locations, figure out one major conspiracy involving homonculi and its leaders, in which by  the end everything falls full circle as it ends in a very satisfying way. I cannot say more due to spoilers.
Art(9.7), Character (9.5), Sound (10) 
The art in FMA: BH is
                  very fluid and crystal clear. The fight scenes are amazing and are very sharp, something STUDIO IG is mostly known for, now BONES takes its spot. The Characters themselves are very unique and believable, they go through though times and deal with it in their own way, something Mr. Eren Yaeger does not know how to do and only complains about everything, so annoying! From the characters of ""Father"" to ""Von Hohenheim"" they have their own goals and make their way toward it. The sound gets a 10/10 because through all scenes it is as if a symphony orchestra is right next to you, scenes can go from sad to shocking as the music adds so much emotion toward the scenes. 
Enjoyment and Overall : 10 (9.8 Rounded) 
I can now understand why this show is beloved by all and has such a high ranking. It is considered as ""Masterpiece"" by some while others it is one of the best shows they have seen. This anime, much like another anime called ""Monster"" (Check it out) are considered ""epics"" to me. They have a large cast, we see each character more than once, they go through a variety of different settings, have important themes and have great villians, in which sometimes you feel for the villians themselves (Envy). If you have time, make sure to watch this, you won't regret it!
P.S. If deciding between FMA: BH and FMA (2003), pretend that anything before 2009 does not exist, the original does not follow the manga AT ALL and SO MANY characters are different than how they should be, it also has an anime only ending. Watch FMA:BH because it stays closer to the manga, has better animation, better sound and an overall theme, then watch original.

And how to stay away from the WORST anime of all time.

                I seriously dont understand what everyone finds so good about this anime. 
It has nothing really speciel to it, it has a very basic storyline, there is nothing new and original. 
Alchemy is nothing new in anime and manga. 
They are supposed to be for mature audience. ( Or at least not only for children) And i really dont see it at all. 
So i am very blind to, what people love so much about this anime. 
Its all about a kid and a his brother, who are being a hero at times, and sometimes are just stupid. 
Really. Thats roufly what this is about,
                  without spoiling something. 
I am giving it a poor review, because i am not in to it at all, and it it supposed to be the best anime by score of all time. 
If you are looking for a good story this is DEFINITLY not it, there are litteraly over 100 that are MUCH better in the same type of envirement, and it being an adventure series. And it does not get better. If you dont like it after seeing 10 episodes, then its not for you. I tried to force it, because i couldnt understand the best rated anime turned out to be so bad. 
The animation is the only thing that is okay.",3

                “Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is Alchemy’s First Law of Equivalent Exchange” — Fullmetal Alchemist
The quote above is certainly true when one thinks about the adaptation history of Fullmetal Alchemist. As compared to the 2003 version, Brotherhood is vastly different. The former did not follow the source material all the way through and pacing was off, whereas Brotherhood followed the source material from beginning to end, and that is why it’s so great. 
If one doesn’t at least know the prolouge story of FMA, then they have no business even
                  reading any reviews. Quite simply, Fullmetal Alchemist as a whole is about two brothers who have committed the ultimate taboo of their world and they paid the price for it. So, they desperately try to get what they have lost, but along the way they uncover  truths that they were not ready for.
The pacing of Brotherhood started off a bit iffy. In the first ten or so episodes, I felt it being a bit episodic. I mean, sure the first arc was about them uncovering the first batch of hard truths about what really was happening, but to me it felt just a little too episodic. Once it got around episode 11, I think that’s really when the show found its ground floor and it was uphill from there on.
When everything was laid out for us and we were slowly fed what the over-reaching plot was, I couldn’t help but find myself so hooked to the screen episode after episode. Each one just pulled me in closer and closer, made me feel for these characters, made me want to know what was happening next, all the while not wanting to miss a single minute.
Sometimes anime can either bring better art styles to an adaptation than the manga ever did or it could be worse. In Brotherhood’s case, I think it fell somewhere in the middle of all of that. Bones really did do a great job capturing the essence of the art style of Brotherhood while also throwing in their own specific style. From how it all flowed in animation to how all of the fights were so brilliantly created. 
I admit, I only watched the dub, so I can’t compare to how the English dub did as compared to the original subs, but I will say this: Funimation never fails to deliver on a great English dub. All around, the dub had a great cast. I don’t think no single voice actor or actress failed at what role they were given. A few standouts were: James Douglas(Major Miles), Vic Mignonga(Edward Elric), Kent Williams(Father), J. Michael Tatum(Scar), and Colleen Clickenbeard(Hawkeye).  
As for the sound effects and soundtrack, I think everything fit well. They timed the right moments with the right tracks. I think certain tracks definitely help set the mood for certain moments while not taking away from said moments. The Ops and Eps definitely were rightly selected. They were great Jrock tracks. I specifically loved the second OP and EP.
Now to the characters. Such a large, yet wonderful cast of characters. Of course, thorugh it all, Ed and Al are the main focus through the first half. Then, that were we got to know the other characters at least in some bits. I really liked how each main character had their own arc and were given time to develop and grow in their own way. For example, I loved how Scar was able to grow in a way that made sense for him. I also liked how Greed kept on swaying from good to bad. I really felt for him.
One standout character through this all was Roy. I loved how his constant arc of the show was a combination of two things: Becoming fuehrer of the country and avenging Hughes. Throughout the entire ordeal of everything going around him, those two main objectives kept his character the most interesting, I think, especially the dark path he took for a few episodes. That really brought the realism of this show full circle and how one decision could set us down the wrong path.
In the end of it all, Fullmetal Alchemist finally gets the adaptation that everyone was waiting for. We finally got a proper one -- one that satisfied those  who read the manga all the way through. It might have a few bumps here and there, but Bones showed us -- and other studios I hope -- how to PROPERLY do an anime series that faithfully follows the source material. 
In any case, it’s a wonderful series that tugs so many heartstrings that we begin to feel like this show’s b-word.

is about two boys who lost their bodies trying to bring their mom back,
and they try to bring it back with the Almighty Philosopher's Stone.
In their journey to find the Philosopher's stone they meet nice people and experience an awesome adventure with good things and bad things
I myself liked this anime because it really had a great plot, it also brought up some tears at some points of the series, I enjoyed every second of my time watching this anime, I don't really care about the artwork of an anime but I know that this Artwork was beautiful, The OP's and
                  ED's are very good and I still listen to them every day, Also the character development was great and I loved a lot of characters.
My score for this series is a 10 and I will always remember how much I enjoyed this anime!",10

                For those associated with the world of anime, you know how hard it is to find animes that really change your outlook on how we live life as human beings. There are only a few that have really dared to speak 'truth' into the kind of society that we live in. FMAB is one of those few. If any of you decide to watch it, watch it soon!!! I guarantee that you will be in one hell of a ride!

                I have watched many anime, yet Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood will always be my absolute FAVORITE.  The story, art, sound, and character development are all pretty much PERFECT in my opinion.  So, let's get started, shall we?
The story sticks to that of the original manga.  The pacing is a little fast, but I was just fine with it.  It just flowed so nicely that I didn't really seem to care.  Actually, I think the fast pacing adds a bit to the suspense of the story.  In any case, the story is fantastic, filled with parts that are almost impossible NOT
                  to cry through.  Good on bones for doing it really well.
The art was fantastic.  The animation progressed smoothly from one frame to the next, even for the large elaborate fight/battle scenes.  I can say for sure that a lot of the scenes in this show would not be as awesome if the animation wasn't as smooth.  Also, I love the character design, which can be attributed mainly to Hiromu Arakawa.  It's fantabulous.
The sound was absolutely stellar.  The soundtrack, while it may seem a tad repetitive, is great as it compliments the mood of the current happenings on screen.  The OPs (four out of five of which I have on my ipod) and EDs (I've got two of those) are great.  They seem to fit really well with the overall plot and concept of the show.  Anyhoo, now on to the Voice Acting.  Mike McFarland has been the ADR director for some of FUNimation's best dubs.  In my opinion, this was his crowing achievement.  For Brotherhood, FUNi pulled out all of its heavy hitters: Travis Willingham (Roy Mustang), J. Michael Tatum (Scar), Colleen Clinkenbeard (Riza Hawkeye), Maxey Whitehead (Al Elric), Vic Mignogna (Ed Elric), and Todd Haberkorn (Ling Yao), are only a few of them.  The characters were portrayed with such emotion.  Sure, crucify me for watching the dub, but I have no regrets for doing so (partially because it was amazing and partially because I pretty much only watch dubs). 
Next we get to the characters.  All I can say is that the character development is perfect.  There are characters that you love and there are characters that you love to hate.  Neither are in short supply in Brotherhood.  The backstory of each character is explained in great, but not too much, detail.  Good on ya, Bones.
Finally, as I said before, this is my favorite anime of all time.  I'm saying this even after I have watched shows such as Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion and Puella Magi Madoka Magica.  I gave this show straight tens.  I can tell you, without a doubt, that FMA: B deserves it.",10
"
                The rating is a joke for this. I grew up to FMA manga and accepting the 1st FMA anime. Then this came out and my mind exploded. If you never watched anime in your life and don't really like it, at least give this one a try. Everyone who watches anime will at least know of FMA B. The story.. is perfect. Things are not all that it seems. There is corruption, there is shady business, there is alchemy! Hell yeah! I like how they portray fascist state regime as well. The art for this anime is also perfect. At least for me, this is
                  how I'd imagine characters to look like in anime. Also they aren't just your typical generic anime characters (although there are definitely some even in FMA).
There will be characters you don't like but for the most part, the characters are flawless and could not have been made any better. Every character in this I loved. However the ones I loved the most were characters like Olivier Armstrong, Lan Fan, Ling Yao, and of course the one and only Hughes.",10
"
                let's talk about positive stuff first:
Character Development is unbelievably good, there are 100 of character and almost every one of them developed decently, I've never seen anything like this, the closest that comes to mind is Monster (The Anime).
Soundtracks are great and openings are greater!
the comedy is just too funny
it doesn't matter what type of a person you are, you'll enjoy this anime**Spoilers Ahead**
Now it's time for criticism:
1) Nobody F**king dies!, it was about episode 30 that I realized that there is no real threat to lives of our heroes, such a shame, there are so many character that are good candidates to be killed, but Nobody dies, except one person that we don't really care about
2) Overpowered Villains suddenly aren't that powerful, a Good example of it is Pride, he was unbelievably Powerful and then he is completely helpless against Al even though Kimberly is helping him as well! it didn't make any sense, the show makes a total badass but he can't kill a single hero!
to be honest he was helping heroes since he killed his own friends randomly!
I wanted to give this anime a 10 but these inconsistencies are major issues
3) Villains Don't kill heroes!
there was no good reason for wrath to allow mustang to remain alive, it was far more logical to just kill a person as potentially dangerous as him
4) cheesiest and dumbest Quotes ever
""Truth is too illogical"", ""are you telling us to approach this problem rationally?"", ""No matter what happens to me I will always be there for my friends"",...
these are the quotes I remember right now but believe me there are a lot of dumber quotes in this anime",6
"
                I just finished watching FMAB a few minutes ago and I'm seriously blown away. Everything about this anime worked perfectly for me. I loved the story, which was amazingly original and had a very good moral (which I find important). The Characters are original and have great development. There just wasn't a single character I found truly annoying. Edward has become my favorite anime character. The music is really good, although I did miss Tsuisou (Kyoudai/Bratja) from FMA. I loved FMA too, but thought that the story became a little random towards the end. I never had this feeling with Brotherhood, because everything I didn't
                  get or found confusing, wasn't part of the story or was explained in a way that I did get it.
FMAB has sad, funny, exciting and even some romantic moments (although not many). It's everything I was looking for in an anime and is absolutely a must watch for every anime/manga fan.",10
"
                There are just some series that when over you say “this was a great anime.” Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is that kind of series. There are times when remakes just don’t work (like the remake for the PSX game Wild Arms), but this is a remake that does pretty much everything right and as a total package is a great series. The original Fullmetal Alchemist was a good series that many enjoyed. Of course the ending and subsequent movie rubbed me the wrong way. But, I don’t think anyone can say it was a bad decision to go back and remake the series following the original
                  manga to the finish. The problem for the first Fullmetal Alchemist was that it started back in 2003. For those who didn’t know the manga finished alongside Brotherhood which ended in 2010. That is a lot of material that the original series could never cover. The only options available to Fullmetal Alchemist was doing an original story or stopping and waiting. Regardless of how that decision turned out that left a lot of material untouched and thus more than enough reason to do a remake. Of course if there is one thing I’m glad they remade the series for it was the EdxWinry relationship. The thing that didn’t really even happen in the original series with how it ended. This time it was done right and you are left smiling at the end.
Of course the story wasn’t simply about these two brothers. At the core of it was Hohenheim, who was so critical to events. They condensed his history into an episode, but one can imagine the kind of life he had to lead. You could really feel sympathy for all the suffering he endured, but by the end he was proud of the life he lead.
It can just continue on with characters like Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Scar, Greed, Ling Yao, May Chang, etc. In terms of characters Brotherhood gets an A+ if I could since there were so many good ones that anyone who watches the series could have different top 5s. In terms of action a lot of characters outside the main leads got serious battles. Characters from Mustang to Ling had some great fights that are easy to remember even after the series has ended. In terms of serious battles it wasn’t like the leads did all the work at all. The best fights in the series probably would go to Mustang and Wrath. They received so many GAR moments it’s hard to believe. I liked how many of the characters really had their motivations tapped into so we could understand where they were coming from. Mustang had the desire to change the country and protect everyone while the powerful motivation to avenge Hughes also drove him on. Ling and May had the future of their respective clans on the line in the battle to curry favour with the Emperor of Xing and become Emperor or Empress. Everyone had things that were driving them forward and the main characters were just part of the whole thing. It’s not like you didn’t care about the leads since they were well developed, but you could care about other characters and no one would fault you.",10

                Now this is what I would call an Anime! Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has everything a viewer could ask for; action, adventure, suspense, thrill, humor, character, a splash of romance, and of course, fun. Not only that but this magnificent Anime includes scientific background; chemistry, to be specific. Could anyone actually believe that a Shonen Anime could have such depth? I couldn't, but Brotherhood kicked that belief's ass and put in a whole new genre of ""Shonen Anime"" in replacement.
The series is primarily dealing with the two adolescents: Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric. Starting off a bit slow, the series brings to you their past events
                  and also current events that leads to their status' as human beings. To be quite honest they have pretty much hit rock bottom, having committed taboo; loosing parts of their bodies, Alphonse's whole body; no parents...my lord, it's just to much to handle. The series shows these events in a unique, if I may say in a 'Spicy' manner. 
Though having a troublesome life, the Elric Brothers are near supreme in a technique called Alchemy (the reconstructing of chemicals into any specific shape or form). Most alchemists have to use a ""transmutation circle"" to use any form of reconstruction, yet the Edward can use alchemy with out the use of such. This brings him his name ""Fullmetal Alchemist."" 
Aside from the basics the plot is pretty much a rollercoaster, it changes all the time because of events that take place in the series. This is what I thought was so unique to Brotherhood compared to any other series. Interchanging plots are hard to come by, it puts enjoyment to a whole new level.
Referring to anymore of the story would just spoil what this series becomes. But what I can say is this alternating plot brings in the exquisite fun that the characters get to handle. New characters get brought in, characters change sides, even characters that have no damn idea what they are doing. This has a huge impact on the viewer, you will never know who to like. Honestly, it's a ton of fun.
Now for the artsy side of the series. The music is definitely well composed, Akira Senju really out did himself this time. Every piece is used as fluently as possible, it'll be something new viewers should look forward too. The animation...okay, well this probably the only downer. Sorry to tell you, but the art just isn't the best. A little goofy looking at time, sometime the hair doesn't fully suit where the place of the head is, just a lot of stuff. But it isn't dreadful! It's honestly good for what it is and it is based on the way Hiromu Arakawa drew the manga. For the initial art not being at its finest, the actions and motions are eloquently done, no doubts there.
But as a conclusion this Anime is worth the time, with all it's elements and new frontiers, nothing can go wrong! If you are going to go on and watch the series, you are going to have a blast. And if you're not, that is your own opinion. But anyway, I hope all you viewers take this Anime in consideration, Thank you for reading!",10
"
                Overall this probably is the best anime ever created. Is it perfect? NO. Is it my favorite? NO. But it is overall very enjoyable for just about everybody. That is the strength of this show; it caters to just about everybody. There are some very funny moments and those are balanced out by some very dark and serious moments. There is plenty of intense action that is quite literally non-stop, and quite frankly it makes DBZ looking boring. The soundtrack for this show is probably my all time favorite for any anime, and I have some the songs on my I-Pod. The plot is very
                  intricate and just about everybody who is introduced in this story serves a role in developing that plot, and I think that is AWESOME. For 64 episodes long, I have never seen so many well flushed-out characters, but this anime achieves that no problem. The English Voice Dub is by far the best dub I have ever heard, and the voice for King Bradley is in a class of its own. I would recommend this to literally anybody, but especially those who like to see incredibly detailed and creative fight scenes. 
Story: 9.5/10
The first 12 episodes are rushed, but that is to be expected when you consider this is a reboot.
Art: 7/10
I personally don't like the way the characters are drawn, but the way the violence is shown (this is a very violent show) is pretty damn cool. People get maimed in this show quite a bit, and there is plenty of blood to go along with it.
Sound: Full 10/10
I really mean this when I say the soundtrack is 10/10. That isn't like a 9.8/10 or whatever, it's a true 10. 
Character: 9.5/10
The main antagonist is a bit dry, but everyone else is loaded with personality.
Enjoyment: 9/10:
I personally wish there would have been more drama in this show. The original FMA did this PERFECTLY for the canon sequence of episodes, and this is probably the greatest flaw in the plot of the story. It lacked the same emotions the first FMA had.
Overall: 9.5/10
This show really should be viewed as a masterpiece due to the fact the story never goes off on any tangents that are unrelated to the plot. It sticks true to its guns and never lets up. The final scene involving the main villain achieving ""GOD"" is probably the coolest thing I have seen in anime, and it really makes the show more interesting overall. I would recommend this show to anybody. It's amazing, but not quite perfect.",10
"
                This is a very easy review. This show does not hold up on its own in anyway shape or form. It literally requires you to have read the manga or seen the previous anime. The original series diverged from the manga and became something truly special because of it. Brotherhood, while being very true to the manga moves at such absurd speeds as to literally ruin it. It leaves absolutely no room for characters to establish themselves or breathe. The show assumes you're either a fan of the previous anime or the manga and does nothing but pander endlessly to people who claim ""BEST EVER"" because
                  they get to see their favorite character in their favorite scene. It's a real shame, because there was a lot of potential here ruined by Bones pandering towards the established fans. The series slows down to an acceptable pace at around the twentieth episode, but by then the damage is already done.
Other than its problems with pacing, story and characterization, the art and animation are fantastic. The voice acting in both languages is superb. The soundtrack really works well with it as well.
To conclude, do not waste your time on utter garbage. People say it's good, but it really is not. 
Very overrated",1

                This show was simply amazing. It had beautiful animation,entertaining characters,an amazing plot and a marvelous story overall. There are almost no fillers and the plot will blow you away, at first I didn't want to watch this but I eventually gave it a chance, and after 2 episodes I was completely hooked and took every chance I could to watch it. It's one of the greatest anime I've ever seen!

                I can not understand how the frick this show is number 1 on mal and has a score of 9.22 of the time of writing this because it sure as frick does not deserve that rating. The story is typical, a protagonist has a goal that is bound to be fulfilled by the end. People say the wordbuilding is brilliant but compared to most animes out now it isnt really that big of a deal. Storywise, it can go more into depth with its story and world but just doesn't. It isn't the worst though since it can be interesting sometimes. The art isn't because
                  of the source material but the anime production staff itself. I don't have a problem with it and i actually find the animation quite apealing. Some viewing positions can make a scene feel more tense and eerie which i really like about fmab. Sound is not really too much of a problem execpt for the fact that the op 1 is the only good op, other than that sound is pretty average. I really don't like a lot of the characters especially alphonse and may. Those 2 never cease to piss me off throughout the show. The sound of alphonse's voice makes me want to choke on a rusty nail and may is just just such a useless and annoying character and the panda god i just wanted it to die already. Other than that the characters weren't the worst and some like Roy actually surpassed my expectations. I didn't hate fmab but i also didn't like it. I was slightly intrigued while being bored at the same time. This anime was not memorable to me whatsoever and was very forgettable. That saying it was not the worst iv'e ever seen and there are defiently better like Hunter and Berserk. In conclusion i wish this show was not ranked 1 because it doesn't deserve to be while Hunter X Hunter does.",6
"
                Where to even begin with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMAB)? This anime is truly spectacular, in a league entirely on its own. My absolute favorite, it's changed my life in more ways than one. There isn't a single person who shouldn't watch it; it's a masterpiece. 
This anime was produced in 2009-2010. I will probably also make references to the first anime, produced in 2003-2004, which had a different plot. So I'll abbreviate the 2009 anime as 'FMAB' or 'Brotherhood' and the 2003 anime as 'FMA'. 
Story: 10 
FMAB is about Edward Elric and his younger brother, Alphonse Elric. They live in a country called Amestris,
                  in a world where the primary form of warfare is through alchemy, the science of deconstructing and reconstructing matter. The presiding law of alchemy, known as the 'Law of Equivalent Exchange', states that humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. 
I won't provide a summary of the anime, as that's already provided. So let me instead say that the storyline of FMAB is--in a word--genius. There's no other way to describe it. There are so many intricate plot twists that just cannot be predicted. This anime starts as simply the Elric brothers' quest to restore their bodies. But it turns into SO much more. As the Elric brothers meet new people--and lose many of them--they realize there is a large underground conspiracy at work in Amestris. Suddenly they are pulled into something much greater than their mission, and they find themselves working to save not only their loved ones, but their country and the entire world. 
*KEEP IN MIND* This series is different from the 2003 anime known as ""Fullmetal Alchemist"". The first 10 or so episodes of FMA adhered to the original plot of the manga, and then the anime series diverged because the manga had not been completed. Personally, I hated the diverged plot. It simply did not seem logical. The ending of the series was terrible, and the follow-up movie, ""The Conqueror of Shamballa"", was also awful. I felt the 2003 anime and movie did not do full justice to the original Fullmetal Alchemist story. 
Art: 10 
Needless to say, the art of this anime is a 10. Arakawa-san (the mangaka of this series) puts great detail into the city of Amestris, the military uniforms of Central Command and Briggs, and every other tiny detail all the way to the last screw in Edward's automail arm and leg. And then there are the transmutation circles!! These were constructed so intricately, I have such unfathomable respect for Arakawa-san for all the work she put into designing these. The art is genius. It enhances the plot and characters even more--if that's even possible--and couldn't better suit the feel of this series. 
Sound: 10 
I love the OST of this anime. It's in my sleeping playlist, my studying playlist, my jump-around-like-an-idiot playlist--you name it, it's there. Tunes like ""Far East Suite"" depict relaxation; ""Overture ~Brotherhood~"" is beautifully reminiscent; ""Xing Symphony (Overture)"" is the perfect music for any battle scene; and don't even get me started on the intensity and tragedy of ""Lapis Philosophorum."" I don't think even Beethoven could have done it better. I have the highest respect for Akira Senju, the FMAB OST composer. The music doesn't distract, but it certainly intensifies every single scene, forcing the viewers to make the characters' emotions their own.
Character: 10 
I've already described Edward and Alphonse Elric for you. Edward is your typical strong-willed pig-headed protagonist with an unbelievably tragic past and an ironically huge complex about his height. Alphonse is the more mild-mannered brother, the voice of reason in the relationship between the two of them. Together, they are unstoppable. Their closeness is admirable. 
But there are other characters besides the beloved Elric brothers. There's Winry, Pinako, Scar, Ling, Lan Fan, and Fu. There are the heroes of Central Command, Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Maes Hughes, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, Heymans Breda, Maria Ross, Kain Fuery, and Black Hayate. And then there are more heroes from North Command at Briggs: General Olivier Mira Armstrong, Major Miles, Captain Buccaneer, and Vato Falman. Every single character in this anime with a name has a huge purpose. Not a single person is underrepresented.
And oh, the villains of this anime! I hated them, of course, but at the same time I respected them so much. The homunculi--nearly invincible and humanlike--are named after the Seven Deadly Sins and emulate their respective sins. But the viewers always catch a glimpse of their humanity--the sadness behind the atrocities they commit, the longing behind their overconfident facades. Sometimes it's difficult to even call them villains, because Arakawa-san shows us that they're not much different from us. Can we really hate them? I have yet to figure that out myself. 
Enjoyment: 10 
There's no emotion that FMAB hasn't evoked. I've shed laughing tears, crying tears, angry tears, frustrated tears. I've gone ""awww"" at cute moments and at death scenes. You never know what's going to happen--you can always expect the unexpected. And you can always count on Edward to diffuse a tense battle moment by tripping and falling or getting angry at someone for calling him short. I enjoyed every single moment of Brotherhood, and I would gladly do it again and again. 
Overall: 10
I would give this series an 11--no, a 20--out of 10 if I could. I have heard nothing but glowing reviews from the people I have recommended FMAB to. Every single genre you can think of is in this series--romance, comedy, military, action, drama, tragedy, psychological--you name it, FMAB's got it! This series has made me cry and laugh and shout at my computer and ultimately smile contentedly at its ending. (While crying, of course, because I didn't want it to end!) I can't even explain how much I love this series. I guarantee it will change your life in some way. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has surely changed my life. I will never forget its impact. I don't think I could even if I wanted to.",10

                Hi, This is going to be my second review on MyAnimeList so I don't have much expertise and I just want to say that my English is not perfect so bear with me.
With that out of the way let's begin.
-Story : 10
The story of FMAB is great but it as it's flaws, the story is kind of cliche and there is not a lot of plot twist which make me sad because I love plot twist but apart from that it's pretty much perfect i mean the lore is amazing lot's of back story on alchemy and homunculus. There is a lot depth and emotion
                  to the story from friendship to romance everything is there.
-Art/Animation : 9 
The art is well done, the backgrounds always feels full and the details is amazing animation is good but sometime feels chunky (rarely). The characters are well drawn and are all different it's nice to see a variety of skin color depending on the regions they are from.
-Sound : 9.5
One of the best OST that i heard in a long time all the op gives you the chills and the music goes well with every moments and gives you that extra feels in intense action scene. Now for the sounds themselves they are genuine but there is sound that I hate it's the gun shots they aren't realistic enough.
-Character : 8 
We have back story for most of the characters but there is some that i would love to know more like the mother of Al and Ed but i guess you can't have everything. The only homunculus with a lot of back story is greed and wrath but apart from those two almost every other Homunculus is untouched.
-Enjoyement 10
Really fun anime i recommend it to everyone who are fans of action and comedy you will not be displeased by the ending :)
-Overall 9.5",9

                I was an adamant fan of the original Fullmetal Alchemist series, and it took me no more than a week to finish the original fifty one episodes. This series, however, is probably nine times better. Even seeing the original this is a completely new experience after about the first six or seven episodes. The artwork is great, not that the original was bad, but it just seems to have a slightly updated, high definition spin on the old. It also seems to add a bit more gore than the original, showing the inner workings of the fights rather than just blood squirts. I love this
                  series, and even if you weren't a fan of the old series this one will likely suck you in with its elaborate plot and the way it propels you straight into it once the ice is broken.",10
"
                While I did finish the series it did not live up to my expectations. I personally had a hard time trying to follow along with the story on what is happening and how it's happening. The story starts off with one plot, but then decides to dive off into a completely different plot. The story makes you think the main villain is person A, but then makes you think it's person B just to make you think it's person C only to finally reveal who the real villain is (character names redacted to prevent spoilers). The are jokes are overused and overplayed. There are situations
                  where the art doesn't fit with the tone the series is trying to take. Some of the characters take a complete 180 on their moral stance and it feels like it came out of no where because they are trying to get the viewer's sympathy.",1
"
                Let me start by saying that this is not the FMA we all know, so any comparison between them is just wrong. 
Story - 9
Story so far is not so different than FMA, but so far Brotherhood is running at the speed it must, and they are pointing very well the little differences so far.
Art - 9
Art is good so far, they use animation with good quality, and fluid and realistic animation. You can see very clearly the differnce between Al's and Ed's movements, which is normal since one is an armor and the other a human. They also put a lot of effort in
                  the action sequences where everything destroyes in a natural fashion.
Sound - 8
Really not so different to FMA, the quality is good, but not the best.
Character - 8
Here is where most people complain, and here is where you must know that Brotherhood is not FMA. While FMA runs over character development, and you get to know almost every character as good as the main characters, Brotherhood fails in that. And they fail on that because Brotherhood is more story-orientated than FMA. The character development is so deep in FMA, that you feel like if an arc finishes when any secondary character dies, while in Brotherhood the death of a character just seems like an ordinary episode, the best example is Hughes, that while in FMA you get to know, and love him very much, in Brotherhood is just another death. This works just fine with Brotherhood, as you'll see when it develops ever further.
Enjoyment - 10
This is tricky, cause if you've already watched FMA, you'll feel like a simple re-run, but as a matter of fact, I'm enyoing Brotherhood much more than FMA, not just because it is running faster, but because they are only empatising things related to the plot, not to the character development.
Overall - 9
While Brotherhood deceive FMA anime hardcore fans, it's good in its own way. It uses a different formula than FMA, and I'm sure that it'll work out. So if you already watched FMA, and you aren't sure if  watch this or not, please do, when the time comes you'll be satisfied that you did, just don't get impatient.",9

                Wow. I know that a lot of people consider Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherood as one of the greatest animes ever, and now that I watched it, I understand why.
This show has got everything.
Beautiful story, amazingly developed characters, solid soundtrack, perfect animations... You just can't deny the fact that Brotherhood is a masterpiece. Some people say that this show is overrated, but believe me, it's not. It deserves all the praise it gets, because I have never seen an entertaining, interesting and never-boring show like this in my life. In my opinion, it's easily one of the greatest anime ever made. If you have the opportunity, just
                  watch it, you will not be disappointed.",10

                ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and the Shonen Milestone""
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has received a plethora of praise and critical acclaim and as listed as number one on this very site. Is it justified or is it just another case of MAL users upvoting their favorite series for no reason? Let's take a look.
Released in 2011, Brotherhood acts as a more direct and faithful adaptation to the original manga. This was most likely done to appease the fans of the manga who didn't care much for the divergent story in the original 2003 anime. Now, as much as I liked the 2003 anime, it had quite a few
                  flaws. After they went in a separate direction from the manga, the 2003 anime took a heavy nosedive. The plot became unfocused and it ultimately felt like a small story taking place in a massive setting. A lot of plot elements didn't click correctly, Wrath was fucking obnoxious, the ending was abrupt and rushed. It wasn't quite a masterpiece, but it was still really good. Then along comes 2011's Brotherhood and as you can probably tell, I think Brotherhood is significantly better than the 2003 anime.
Brotherhood's story was focused, logical, had heart and emotion, was well executed, gave depth to every character that needed it and some that didn't, and even addressed some of the more annoying plot issues that the original anime had (and even some that were in the manga!) Every opening and closing song is great and fits the tone of the current arc, and personally my favorites were ""Again"" by Yui, and ""Let It Out"" by Miho Fukuhara. The soundtrack is unbelievable and carries a very emotional tone to the visuals, which are nothing short of great.
The great visual direction of the 2003 anime carries over to Brotherhood, with for the most part improvements in animation. The original's art style was a bit bland and dated poorly, but Brotherhood has a more timeless and comforting look to it that sets it apart. The only real problem I have it Envy. Envy's 3-dimensional animation for his true form is nothing short of unsightly. Putting 3D animation in a show like this is fine, so long as you don't do it once. That's because it will stick out horribly and look completely unnatural. Sure enough, it looks completely unnatural and ugly. Still though, nearly flawless. 
As far as characters go, Brotherhood once again shines. Every character, even the ""evil""* characters, are somewhat relate-able, understandable, and/or likable. I put an asterisk next to evil because Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of those clever little shows that knows that there is no such thing as good or evil. Every character's motivations and actions are clearly presented outside the childish realms of good and evil, so that every event feels real and the result of true human conflict. What would be a mustache twirler in any other show is a complex character with interesting traits and understandable motivations in Brotherhood.  
What I consider to be Brotherhood's greatest strength is its heart and emotion. I mean no hyperbole when I say I cried for the entire last 2 episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Seeing every arc come together flawlessly and bring the anime to a close was absolutely beautiful, and it wasn't just the characters that held such powerful emotional weight. I was crying partially because I didn't want it to be over. It was too perfect and I couldn't believe it was over because I was enjoying it too much. I should say too that the list of things that have made me cry is a pretty short. It consists of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Pay It Forward, (some movie I can't remember at the minute), and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. So to say that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood carries emotional weight is a massive understatement, as it is not only intelligent, but made with real heart and it shows.
I don't give 10s out very often in any format, but Brotherhood most certainly has earned its mark. While the 2003 anime was very good and still outshines most other shonen, Brotherhood feels like the Fullmetal Alchemist series is just taking a victory lap. It's so good that it's practically unfair to even label it a shonen. It can appeal to anyone and everyone, and in my opinion, is virtually flawless.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood earns a 10/10.",10

                When i started watching this show, i was thinking that it would be great, because it is so well rated among the fans. 
BUT , it was a lie. I considered this show, a normal one. Like every other shonens, it just couldn´t be better. It has a litle bit of everything, wich is nice. But for those (like me) who are lokking for more specific genders (like drama, or action) it won´t be found on this show. 
I think that it has nothing special besides the  great history behind it (i loved the history) but the rest is just meh, not enough for
                  the overall rate of 9.24/10 . 
The character development is weak as everything. They don´t go deep into any character. They explore some of them but not deep enough.  
The main character, Edward Elric is really the main character? Because for a shonen, having the best action parts not envolving the main character, is strange for me. Let's face it, the best fights he doesn´t even appears. 
The plot is nice, but it is not big enough for 64 episodes .. in the middle of the anime i was bored and watching for get to the end. I reached the end, and it's nothing more than a normal end. The weak good guy defeats the strong bad guy cause he has friends .. tipical of a shonen. 
Overall, this anime may be good for those who are starting to getting deep in the anime world, or for young groups. But for those who are looking for a more detailed anime about certain gender(such as drama / action / romance  ) i don´t advise you to watch this one.  
The plot saved this anime, that's why i gave it a 7/10. 
Sorry for the crappy english at some parts ;P",7

                Doing a back log of reviews at the moment and this times its one of my favorite anime series of all time FMA: Brotherhood now unlike its earlier adaptation of the series  follows the manga extremely closely and if you love the manga then you'll love the TV adaptation.
Both the Dub and Sub versions of this series are extremely well done and you won't find many people who disagree with me saying this its a must watch show.
The story about two boys trying to get their bodies back by the use of a philosopher stone. Now i'll stop there as its better to experience
                  the show yourself. The story is perfect in my opinion its an emotional ride that will make you connect with all the character even if you only known them for a few minutes. The story brings in morals and makes you think and this is why i love the story its just amazing and lets be honest you can't help but love the story.
The Art now at the time of this review is 5-6 years old but in my opinion its art still rivals the ones today and helps enrich the story rather then overshadow the story and characters, the artists on this series put in the time and effort to make it great. 
The sound and music of this show is epic and amazing, all the opening, closing themes are beautifully done and we all remember at least one of them, the sounds in the show itself helps draw you in and helps shows a characters development when someones angry, upset or happy.
Character wise, every character gets development and you get attached to each and everyone of them, both the animals and the humans and it can make you smile and cry when you find out what happens. 
The enjoyment is just perfect and will want you to watch it over and over again as it has to be an all time great in my opinion, the show is good for new comers and veterans alike as it has something for everyone. 
Overall the shows is just breathtakingly beautiful and i'm sure you will enjoy it as much as i have, i love this show as it has a bit of everything, romance, action, adventure, suspense. And as i said its for everyone and i'm sure you'd love it to :D",10

                I was a huge fan of the first FMA series.  the drama was exciting, I liked the intensity of emotion for Ed and Al and their storyline, I liked the sympathetic portrayal of the homunculi, and so on.  I couldn't get enough of it.  
Then I started watching Brotherhood and reading the manga, and both of them just blew the doors off of the first series.  In fact, I have since readjusted my score of the first series because of this.  
Story - the story is absolutely humongous, spanning not just throughout Amestris but around the world.  The motive
                  behind the homunculi and their controlling presence, Father, is quite mysterious and complex, and I like the fact that the reasoning is not so laid out.  I'm writing this as of episode 29, and you can already start to see the scope of their scheme and the ends to which they will go to fulfill it.  And it does this without taking away the very essence of what drives Ed and Al- the desire to get their own bodies back.  10 out of 10.
Art- Outstanding.  I really don't like the new character designs quite as much as the first series, but they more than suffice.  What really makes the art for this series stand out is the animation for the fight sequences, which look fast, fluid, intense, and extraordinarily exciting.  Also, big plus for the animation behind Envy's true form- looks like something out of a Lovecraftian nightmare. 9 out of 10
Sound- Very strong.  I find it hard to imagine another Japanese voice actor taking the place of Romy Park as Edward Elric, and she's as good as ever here, and the others are highly admirable as well.  The music is not terribly special- I'd say it's good, and serves its function well, but is not great.  8 out of 10.
Character- this is where the series really soars.  While in the first series we primarily got character development for only a handful of characters, here we're getting character development from every direction- not only from the core group, but also Hawkeye, Havoc, King Bradley, Armstrong, Winry, and others, many of whom were not given their due attention in the first series.  But here we really get the depth of the connection between Hawkeye and Mustang, more of a background on Bradley, even Havoc is more than just comic relief.  Because of the breadth  of the characters they take their time to develop, 10 out of 10.  
Enjoyment- simply put, every episode from about 19 onward had me just about jump out of my seat with emotion, whether it be shock, or glee, or whatever.  It thrills you, moves you, makes you laugh, basically it pulls out all the stops in order to keep you engaged and entertained.  There are moments that were removed from the manga that I wish they had preserved (especially from episode 30 the Ishbal flashback), so that's definitely a knock on the anime, but for the most part I'm getting a kick out of this series.
Overall- Like I said earlier, I loved the first series, it was one of my favorite anime.  I also was in the middle of rewatching the first series until about the point where the manga and Brotherhood started to pave its own way apart from the first series.  That was three months ago and I have not watched the first series since.  
This was headed for a 10 out of 10, but their rendition of the Ishbal flashback in episode 30 left me wanting.  Still, a very, very good 9 out of 10.",9
"
                Watching this anime for the first time after all the praise I've heard for it lead me to be extremely disappointed.
At first, the premise is interesting. The characters are interesting, everything just seems good.
But as you continue watching it only sinks further and further down hill.
Twists are as heavy handed as they are predictable, Plot holes appear every minute, The characters become less and less believable and well, kind of stupid.
It may be pretty, morbidly entertaining and have a strong, interesting beginning, but it is unfortunately plagued with bad, forgettable characters, a terribly mishandled mystery, half-heated or straight up missing explanations and many other writing
                  flaws. I would say If you don't want a melodramatic action series that drags on way too long, then watch something else. Like, I dunno, the paint peeling off a wall.",6
"
                (This is only an anime review)
Opening and ending - The openings really got you pumped up about what you're about to watch and the endings made you sad that the episode was over. Personally, all the OP's and ED's made you feel serveral feelings all at once
The Ending (Spoiler free) - The ending was very well played and I actually cried. Out of all the anime and manga that I have seen and read, only 4 have actually made me cry. Including this one. It really pulled the whole series together and made you want to watch it over and over again.
Plot - The plot
                  was incredibly unique and made the series stand out from other anime series in general. Especially including the very much used ""7 deadly sins"" plot and made it unique in it's own way.
Overall - It was good XD",9

                For a while I was very hesitant to watch FMA:Brotherhood. From what I had seen it seemed like a show that was based around humor and seemed like it wouldn't really go anywhere. Don't me get wrong, I love comedy, I just hate it when that's all the anime is about.That being said, brotherhood is hilarious at times, I often found myself laughing while watching it. I eventually decided to watch brotherhood, because I figured I should give it a shot. It has made it's way into my top 5 list and is one of the best animes out there.
Story- The story is explained fairly
                  well in the synopsis so there isn't much I can really say, but here is a small explanation of it from my point of view. So you have these two brothers who got into alchemy at a young age. They end up losing their mother and they try to bring back her back through alchemy (which is a taboo) but to no avail. In the process Edward Elric loses his leg and his brother Alphonse his entire body, in a worried attempt Edward sacrifices his right arm in order to bind his brothers soul into a suit of armor. The whole story is about their adventures to find a philosophers stone so they can use it's power and get their bodies back. With it being a long anime and having a fairly straight-forward goal in mind you would figure it would have some filler right? Absolutely wrong, there is not one episode of filler in brotherhood, that is what I like most about it. It's a long anime that has no filler! It has done what seems to be impossible to me. On-top of it having no filler, and having non-stop action every single episode, it actually isn't all comedy based like I had previously thought. It actually has a very dark side to it and it caught me off-guard within the first few episodes. A few scenes in particular have stuck with me and still make me depressed or have given me angst when I think about it. Not to sat that it doesn't have comedy in it, it's actually one of the funniest animes I have watched, but the comedy feels good in it and doesn't feel out of place like some anime I have watched.  It has a ton of plot twists that you don't actually see coming and gives you a ton of back-story so you actually feel like you know these characters, not  just the main characters either, you really get to know some of the side characters. They don't feel like they where just there, they all have depth and feel important to the story, and if something happens to them you actually get worried about them and care what happens. It had an extremely good ending and I had only 1 complaint about the whole story. I don't want to spoil anything, but lets just say the ending was ""missing something"". It was nothing critical to the main story, but if they had added a little more at the ending and emphasized on a few things it would have made it that much better.
Art- The animation and art are really well done. It had some rather creepy and eerie feeling artwork in it, which really set the mood. Nothing much to really say, it was top notch animation and artwork.
Sound-It has a various number of openings and endings, all of which I really liked and enjoyed. Brotherhood has one of the best English dubs in existence, they voice acting is extremely well done and I couldn't imagine watching it any other way.
Character- Brotherhood has a really amazing cast of characters, a rather huge cast of characters that actually have a ton of depth to them and feel important. The two main characters Edward and Alphonse are just awesome people. Edward has a height complex, which he gets made fun of alot and I find it just hilarious. Then you have Alphonse who is just a badass and wants to just get back to his original body. Some of the side characters I really like are Winry, who is a child hood friend of Edward and Alphonse, Louis Armstrong, who is just a monster of a man who flaunts his muscles every chance he gets and gets beat up on by his sister(which is hilarious), ling, who is a foreigner who is actually quite badass, and last but not least is colonel mustang, who is arguably the strongest alchemist with his fire alchemy. My point being is that the entire cast is just awesome and very well made.
Enjoyment- There was never a dull moment with this anime, whether it was one of the amazing fight scenes going on, something tragic happening, a crazy plot-twist, or just something hilarious, there was always something entertaining happening. You would have to be a really boring person not be able to get some sort of entertainment from this.
Overall- Overall this is really a masterpiece of an anime. I judge anime very harshly and it made it's way to my top 5 list, so if that doesn't something I don't know what does. It is a very enjoyable anime that ANY otaku should watch. I really can't properly explain how awesome this is, just go and watch it and you will understand, just make sure you watch the dub, because it is a really well done dub.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one of the most critically acclaimed anime loved by both connoisseurs and casuals.
Let me start with the very first mentionable point to notice, which is a negative one. This anime expects its viewers to be already well acquainted with the franchise before watching it. So, the introduction is pretty straight forward and awkwardly so. I get that it has its alternative version or a manga with proper introduction. But, that's not Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and people would definitely not like to read the manga or another anime with 51 episodes before watching a 64 episodes anime just for a proper introduction.
                  In Brotherhood, at the beginning, you see the characters doing whatever they do without you knowing what it is that they're doing, or even saying. ""Oh so he's the Fullmetal Alchemist!? Whatever the hell is a Fullmetal Alchemist anyway?"" So, yeah.
Despite being awkward at the beginning, there is something that still makes it perceivable. You don't know the details, but you have a vague idea that something is actually happening, so the viewers are tempted to watch further to know what exactly was it as there were many flashy things going on and it felt like there was some meaning to it. It's a cheap trick to hook the viewers, but it worked. That's what saves it from being dropped at the very beginning, but the fact that it's awkward still remains. This is how it is for the first few episodes. After that you get rewarded for not dropping it earlier with some genius story composition. This anime's storyline considers a number of possibilities and takes the best path. Which ends up with a brilliant ending, that I consider one of the bests among happy endings. It packs up the whole series nicely, making it a complete story.
The anime has an overarching and well progressing plot handled carefully. I didn't notice any bothersome inconsistency after the opening episodes. The story isn't repetitive in any way. It's story is simple but has considerable depth to it.
Although the characters who were introduced at first had improper introduction, I as a viewer got along with them as time passed. The characters introduced later on are well presented. But, the character development in this anime is very typical and genric. Bad guys get saved by the good guys, realize that they shouldn't follow the orders of the evil bosses and help the good guys on their own will. And someone gets violent as hell who doesn't feel strong restraint when killing someone almost overnight after a harsh experience. Something we haven't ever seen? The development on the good guys isn't remarkable and sometimes nonexistent. There are however some really good character development. For example, the slow and consistent development of that greedy man I forgot the name of who used to own a mine or something that he lost due to our MC, Edward Elric and some Homunculi. What's genuinely good about this anime's characters is the screentime distribution. This is very essential in this anime in particular, partly because it has many likable characters and it'd be really disappointing if they didn't get enough screentime.
The antagonism in this anime is shallow, with very weak reasons and goals to justify for all the dreadful deeds. The evil military personnel and some other bad guys are horribly one dimensional. The character interaction is decent, but could've been better. The overall cast is very well handled, nevertheless.
I liked the world building in this anime. It makes big approaches by dividing the State, having different regions with different climate, culture, general attitudes and lifestyles. It makes medium approaches by having different cities, towns, countrysides, etc with their definite geological location and connecting them with consideration of distance and cultural transition. And finally, it makes small approaches by detailing the small points in the places where the story takes place in. It's attention to tiny details like mud on the body after crossing a muddy path, or dirts after falling on the ground were mesmerizing but never preachy. The anime makes no unrealistic or unbelievable change in the already established environmental points. Basically, it did excellent job on the places it shows. But unfortunately, it doesn't show majority of its world. We only get to properly see The State of Amestris. It gives a small idea of Xing through some of its characters from that empire, but that wasn't enough to relay a good description. We don't really even know if there's any other country aside from the State of Amestris, Xerxes and the Empire of Xing. And even if it did mention other countries, it must've been very unimpressive for me to remember or even notice. In short, it doesn't quench one's thirst for the view of its world. Then again, it's a good thing that the anime doesn't go out of its way to show around the parts of the world that aren't important, consequently not drawing the attention away from the story. I'd like to inform you that it has a town based on automails as well.
Automails are prosthetic limbs made of metal. The technology behind this element is not much explained, but I really liked it. How they presented that there is nerve connection and the pain of that time really made me feel it. I liked how there are so many types of automails. And loved the idea of having different types of automails for different weather. Basically I loved how they didn't leave it as it is just because it's not a main element and was used for more reasons than just showing Edward's resolves.
The main element, Alchemy, is an edited form of the Alchemy we know. Here, one can understand, break and reconstruct matters and that's what Alchemy here is. It's not very deep, but efficient. Aside from shooting pillars and rocks (like wtf!?), the use of Alchemy is very good. The difference in the usage of Alchemy between the West and the East is interesting. Alchemy is adequately crafted to satisfy a superficial view while also running the story, it's not enough explored to get past the highly functioning brains that like to go deep into analysis. But well, it doesn't need to be extremely deep and didn't do anything pretentious to make it deep either. The shooting pillars and rocks are still blatant though.
The power curve of this anime is very good. The MC isn't utterly overpowered. In fact, he's far outranked by many people. He trains, but doesn't become stronger than most of them which is really plausible. The overpowered villain is justified. I loved how in the end, the anime didn't pull any unnecessary, unbelievable, unreliable power up to defeat the overpowered villain.
A bothersome point in this anime is the immortal army. FMAB does have a realism that it sticks to, but this particular point is slightly too unrealistically overdone considering its realism. It's not really much necessary either. I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have felt anything lacking if this wasn't here. The evil military personnel could've been brainwashed instead of tempted, which could've solved an aforementioned issue as well.
Anyway, many of the shortcomings in this anime are obtained through nitpicking and are massively outweighted by its greatness. The plot points are tied very well so there's no considerable loose end. It's overarching with its elements and plot but still very well handled. There are sufficient job done on everything. It's philosophy is simple and unpretentious. The main philosophy that for getting something, there has to be a sacrifice of equal amount is an excellent example. It also tells us to not be too conceited. There are many other teachings relayed in the anime. Truth's vague existence actually plays well here.
FMAB has great animation and cinematography. The artwork of the character design is good, but how it was used was slightly problematic. Especially when you can't tell that a seemingly man is actually a woman. The reason might be that almost all the faces are designed rounded and there are little difference in male and female facial construction. Well, I'm not sure if it's because of getting used to it or the improvement of the art, but it seems perfect later on. It's probably the latter but if just in case it is the former, then the anime does great job helping the viewers to get used to it. The attire design is excellent and the colors are masterfully used while designing the characters. It has some extremely well choreographed fight scenes which are exhilarating. This anime has by far one of the best collection of opening and ending songs if not the best. All of them are great. Some are easily top list materials. The background musics are remarkable as well. Loved Lapis Philosophorum in particular.
The atmosphere of this anime is not as dark as its former 2003 version and I found it more fitting. The lighthearted un-overwhelming atmosphere is a better choice here, imo.
This anime is superficially perfect. It's specialty is that it has almost everything you need to learn and can ask for from an anime. And there's no way to call it ""pretentious"". Overall, it's very well put together and definitely one of the best anime I've watched so far.
It's a tier 1 9/10 show.",9

                I thought it was terrible! It’s the worst show that I have ever seen… is what I would like to say. To my surprise, FMA:B is the best shounen show that I have seen in my life (not that I have watched many other shounen series, but whatever). If I had seen this as a kid, I may have been reeled to watching anime way earlier than I did. Note that I haven’t watched the first anime adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist and I don’t think I will anytime soon.
Frankly, I was hesitant to pick up FMA since I tend to avoid shounen like the plague,
                  but since I have dedicated myself to watching the more popular shows recently, I figured that this is the one that I should start with (also with a lot of persuasion power on the part of my friends).
What made me like this show? Well, for starters, It is very, very entertaining. Believe it or not, I finished watching the whole of FMA:B in just four days. I loved it that much. It had very nice fight scenes and overall aesthetic appeal. But FMA:B had something that similar shounen shows didn’t have: direction. Unlike most other shounen anime, FMA:B knows that it has a story to tell. It doesn’t waste time on things that do not contribute something to world building, character building/development or historical background. You will even find yourself amazed that “filler” episodes aren’t exactly filler.
I guess this is from the fact that the manga has already ended when Brotherhood was made, but it’s still pleasant to find a shounen anime that doesn’t troll you (hello there Bleach, Naruto and One Piece!) or make kids’ games a part of a large scale of glorified nonsense (hello there every single toy advertisement anime!).
Other than these things, FMA:B still keeps the spirit of shounen, an anime that appeals to young children, while being entertaining enough to be appreciated by the veteran anime watcher. I guess the only thing that I would nitpick about is its virtually zero rewatch value. I wouldn’t really want to watch this all over again, but hey, that’s a prime characteristic of a shounen show and I’m completely fine with that.
I’d love to tell you more about this anime, but I wouldn’t want to spoil all of the juicy parts. I say, just watch it and see for yourselves – a shounen with direction, protagonists with personality and hard-earned real power, and a very nice show to look at. I couldn’t ask any more from an anime from a genre that I don’t usually watch.
As of this writing, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of my all-time favorite shows at number 5 with my personal MAL rating of 8.",8
"
                     Having watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist series at a young age (the series itself came out in 2004, I believe), my twelve-year-old self was stoked when I found out that there was a reboot whilst screwing around on some anime chat room. The year was 2010. Needless to say, I ended up loving the show, even more than the original. All of my favorite characters had returned, and were just as badass as ever. But this anime needs more than a paragraph. It deserves more than that. There's a reason that people still discuss it, and the fanbase is just
                  as fervent as when the show was airing all the way across the Pacific in good old Nihon. Or the Atlantic and all of Asia... Whatever. Same thing.
Story:  Without getting too deep into the FMA:B storyline, the basic premise of the show involves two brothers who, accidentally (duh), forfeit their limbs and bodies in an attempt to bring their mother back to life using alchemy, which also happens to be a moral taboo. They then seek to find some way of restoring their lost humanity (and pride) by setting out on a journey in search of the fabled Philosopher's Stone. The story, of course, does not end there. But what fun would it be if I spoiled anything else? Alchemist's story manages to be engaging with, quite amazingly, zero baggage, even while clocking in at beefy 64 episodes. There is a clear purpose constant throughout each episode that never gets muddled or buried by another storyline. Everyone has their motives, and these motives propel the story forward. Some people might find the first few episodes somewhat rushed, as they cover a lot of material in a short amount of time. I assume that this is because much of said material was covered in the first series, which most viewers have typically seen. The pacing eventually evens out, however, when new material is introduced. The anime's story follows the original storyline of the manga, which the original veered away from about halfway through its runtime. And, in my opinion, the manga storyline is much better. There are too many differences to cover, and doing so would mean spoilers, but I will say that the ending in Brotherhood is perfect, much better than the original's mediocre one.
Art and Animation:  The show is animated by Studio BONES (Soul Eater, Space Dandy, Eureka Seven, Wolf's Rain, Darker than Black, Gosick, Ouran). Those familiar with BONES know that it, when given a good budget, can rival any other studio in production quality. As with Brotherhood, the animation is wonderful. The art is very colorful, and the characters' features stand out amongst the backdrops. The show's visual quality is superior to the original, which is expected with a higher budget. As great as the art is, it isn't jaw-dropping.                                  
Sound: There's not much to talk about here. The soundtrack is perhaps a bit above average, and while it fits and benefits the show, it isn't something I would rush to purchase. The sound design (sound effects, etc.) is worth mentioning, as it brings the fast-paced alchemy battles and gunfire-laden battlefronts to life. Vic Mignogna's performance as Edward Elric in the English dub is also noteworthy.                                
Characters:  This is the beef of the show (as with almost all good animes, imo). Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric reprise their roles as the main protagonists in Brotherhood, as well as all supporting protagonists. The villain cast, mainly comprised of mysterious apparitions named after the 7 Deadly Sins (if that doesn't make you want to watch the show, I don't know what will) returns for a second round at our heroes as well. As simple as it sounds, it's not quite so. For starters, there is a substantial amount of characters. It's not the most I've ever seen, and not all that tricky to keep track of (animes like Baccano!, for example), but viewers familiar with harem shows or other tightly-knit casts might be uncomfortable at first with the scale of Alchemist's world. But it's this scale and complexity that moves the show's pistons, all while elevating it above its competition. Not a single character is unnecessary, each one playing some form of role that completes the show. The chemistry between Ed and Al is vital not only for the show's plot, but for the emotional links necessary to keep a viewer interested in a 64 episode show. On the antagonist side, our villains possess just as much chemistry. Er, well, at least some of them... There are some characters whose presence also defies the typical good-vs-bad, and are not necessarily anti-heroes either. Their existence alone provides plenty of material, which, of course, relates back to the main plotline. None of the characters are annoying, which is perhaps the most amazing feat (most shows have at least one character that is obnoxious). Kudos to the writers on these characters. They could be the best I've ever seen.
The Final Verdict:  Fullmetal Alchemist has been a huge staple in the anime world since 2004. After Brotherhood, it has become a legend. I always find it easier in hindsight to criticize shows and nitpick their flaws. As I grow older, I'm able to look back at shows that I loved as a kid and accept that they were not the pinnacle of entertainment (Dragonball series, Pokemon, etc.). Looking back at Brotherhood, however, only affirms what I thought of it as a preteen: one of the greatest series of any form of entertainment that I have ever viewed. The world of anime, as well as films, music, video games, and even politics is full of fads, things the “come and go”, as we commonly put it. Five years from now , Sword Art Online will be an obscure title that very few will remember or know about. It's been a decade since the original FMA aired in Japan, and many still discuss it. I anticipate that in the years to come, many will discuss Brotherhood, whether it's children mesmerized by the animation and color, teenagers in awe of the epic actions scenes, young adults enamored in the subtle romantic subplots, or adults impressed and intrigued with the complex chemistry between the characters.

                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood does not live upto its hype. It does not live upto the #1 anime status on MAL. While the story, concept of power and the characters are unique the overall enjoyment in the show is low. Besides a few scenes that hype you up and make you go ""woah"" the main attraction of this anime is the type of relations that are formed and broken throughout the 64 episodes, which isn't always interesting to watch. That being said I would praise FMAB and the team behind it for the effort on this anime because for its time, it was wellmade. But in
                  this current generation of anime, it certainly isn't one that would strike you as a banger. It still is an anime every avid anime watcher must watch at some point in their life because while it may not be the most enjoyable anime, it is still pretty unique in many aspects.",7
"
                This is more of an analysis than a review, to be honest. I also took some ideas from other analysis of the show so be sure to check them out.
 Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood - 8/10
In a nutshell, a very well done shounen, with amazing action scenes, gripping story and rich lore, with the downside being the two-dimensional characters that all behave according to one dominant characteristic, maintain simple morales because of a cliche but detailed backstory and have a simple one-sided relationship with other characters. The soundtrack is also pretty good, the animation quality is superb, nothing too special, but it is still very good
                  and pleasant to watch. The enjoyement rate here is quite high for a shounen. Characters here absolutely suck, just generic plot devices, but at least the story is very smartly written, even though nothing too awesome.
But the real highlight of the show is it's themes. I'm going in depth into them here, so somewhat a spoiler alert.
""Wraith, Envy, Sloth, Pride, Lust, Gluttony, Greed"" - 7 antagonists of the show. 
And that's where this show truly comes into full terms.
The obvious symbolism like ""The Fuhrer"" humans' strive for perfection, racism, extermination, fear, revenge and the ""Equal Exchange"" (basically Eye for an Eye and Tooth for a Tooth) and religion and much more, is all good, but there is more beneath it.
The theme of ""God is Dead"" is supported by the fact that Edward is an Atheist all while still being moral, it shows how Edward didn't get his beliefs inModern Naturalism, Existentialism and Humanism through a religous text, but rather from experiences and his own view of the world, which is a reference to the theme of rejection of Biblical Absolutism, where the texts of the bible should not be taken seriously, but only as a reference, and this all links in to the ending episode, where the Father fails to become a perfect being, even through sacraficing the equivilant of god and getting rid of the 7 sinful desires, he does not reach the Ubermensch status, whereas Ed does, through his own beliefs which again come from his own Experiences and his own Philosophy, in the end he sacrafices his power and refers to himself as an ordinary human, he gives himself for others, that confirms he accepts humanity, and sacrafices one for the other which shows he, did gain the Ubermensch status through understanding and accepting and believing in Humanity
It shows how Father is the nutshell of the ""last men"" whose only desire is for his own comfort, and he does not help other and contribute, which stops him from becoming perfect. It shows how possibly the lack of religion may give birth to Immorality as in lack of morales (Nietzsche) - whereas Ed shows that it can, being perfect and helping others, all while being an atheist and Ubermensch, opposite of Last Men.",8

                Anyone who's familiar with anime has heard of Fullmetal Alchemist. The manga and the two anime based off of it have both become powerhouses in the industry both by themselves and with merchandise: plushies, video games, wall scrolls and so on. When I received a review request for Brotherhood I wasn't sure how to distinguish what I have to say from what's already been said. That's when I was given a helpful suggestion from one of my lovely fans (I just assume that all my fans are lovely people.) A comparison review discussing the differences between FMA and Brotherhood and which is the stronger anime.
                  It's been quite a while since I got the request since I needed time to re-watch both anime, but let's take a look at FMA vs. Brotherhood.
The overall story starts out the same: two alchemist brothers attempt to bring their dead mother back to life and one loses an arm and leg the other loses his entire body. The two go on a journey to find the philosopher's stone in the hopes of regaining their bodies. On the way they run into artificially created humans called homonculi who are planning something nasty for the entire country and the brothers have to find out what it is and how it can be stopped. The stories diverge at that point, but I can't really go into too many details without giving spoilers. Which is better? Well, both have some intriguing ideas presented and both are well-paced with good action and character moments. That being said, Brotherhood is better overall. The story holds together a bit better and it doesn't have all the filler that weakens the original. In Brotherhood, everything is relevant. You couldn't take out a few episodes and lose nothing. That being said, I'd like to take a moment to address the endings. Both anime have weak endings. FMA because it's rushed, Brotherhood because it's cliche and pretty stupid. FMA actually has a more satisfying ending as a result. It may be rushed, but at least there was an obvious effort that went into it. Brotherhood's ending is just lazy. 
Let's move on to the characters. This is a bit more difficult so I'm going to split it into four categories: protagonists, antagonists, supporting characters and military characters. Let's start with the protagonists. Edward and Alphonse are pretty close to identical in both anime. They're a bit jaded since they had to grow up too fast, but they've also got a naive idealism about them which creates an interesting dichotomy. Both anime put them in moral dilemmas that build their characters. Really, it's difficult to say that one anime handles them better than the other, but if I had to choose I would say that the original handles them better. The main reason being the underground laboratory scene. I won't go into too much detail but it's a really powerful scene in the original that really pushes Ed into a serious dilemma and forces him to make a difficult choice. In Brotherhood, that choice doesn't exist and the Brothers' decision as a result seems much stronger in the original. Now, let's talk about our antagonists. The Homonculi and their creator. There actually is a pretty substantial difference with them in the two anime. Three Homonculi are completely different, their leader is different and the way they're created is different. Which one is better? It has to be Brotherhood in this case. FMA's homonculi could've been much more interesting, but they never develop them and the logical conflicts that should arise from the way they're created are never fully explored but rather, only briefly touched on. Their leader is also severely under-developed in FMA and comes off as more of a one-dimensional cartoon villain than an interesting character. Brotherhood does a much better job of fleshing the antagonists out as characters and making them interesting. Brotherhood also does a much better job of connecting the attributes that they're named for to their characters. Now, let's move on to supporting characters. Both anime have massive casts and both do a lot with them. Neither of them get the chance to fully develop their supporting casts but both manage to do quite a bit. Which one does better with them? I would have to say it's the original. There are two reasons for that. The first is that Brotherhood has one really annoying character (May) that the original doesn't. The second is that FMA does a bit more to develop the ones it has. Now for the military characters. The reason that this is its own category is simply that there are so many military characters in both anime and they take on various roles. Which one is better? That would be Brotherhood. Again, there are two major reasons. The first being that Brotherhood has some interesting characters that FMA lacks most notably the Briggs soldiers. The second is that Brotherhood does a much better job of showcasing the cleverness of these characters, especially Roy Mustang and his group. The original does a lot less with them and, as a result, they come off as much less interesting. So, which series does better with characters overall? I'd have to say Brotherhood. FMA does slightly better with the protagonists but Brotherhood does much better with the antagonists. FMA does more with the supporting characters, but Brotherhood does more with the military and they're more important to the plot.
Now, let's talk about the art. This is a difficult one since both anime have nearly identical art styles. But there is one major difference and that's the comedic effects. These are moments where the art style changes temporarily for comedic impact and Brotherhood does it a lot more than FMA. Honestly, I think that they work on occasion but that they detract from the flow of the series when they're over-used. Brotherhood doesn't just over-use them, it downright abuses them. As a consequence, the original really does have a stronger aesthetic sense.
Some of the actors are the same. Paku Romi, Kugimiya Rie, Utsumi Kenji, Shibata Hidekatsu and several others do really well in both anime. Even the actors who change give roughly equal performances. As a result I'm going to have to base the sound competition on the music. In this case, FMA is superior to Brotherhood. It might have one really stupid and annoying song (Ready Steady Go) but overall it has much more memorable and better done music. This isn't to say that Brotherhood has bad music, it's just pretty forgettable. There are one or two really good songs but they can't really compare to Melissa, Shounen Yo Shinjiru Nakama Yo, or Hagane no Kokoro.
Let's quickly look at the yuri factor. FMA has more les-yay than Brotherhood. The major reason being that FMA mostly avoids developing het romances and concentrates on developing relationships between the characters some of which read as a bit homo-erotic. Particularly the dynamic between Sheska and Winry. Brotherhood has a few homo-erotic moments, but not to the same extent. I'm giving FMA a yuri factor of 3/10 and Brotherhood a yuri factor of 1.5/10. 
So, when all is said and done, which anime is stronger? I'm going to have to say Brotherhood. They're both great anime, but Brotherhood has the more cohesive story and superior characters. FMA has better art and music, but those aspects simply aren't as important. My final ratings are an 8/10 for FMA and an 8.5/10 for Brotherhood. You couldn't go wrong with watching either of them but if you're only going to watch one, make it Brotherhood.",8

                Light- Medium Spoilers
For a lot of months I had been debating with myself whether or not I should watch the so called “Number One"" show in MAL. At first I was very worried that this show wouldn't deliver due to its immense hype and showers of praise, however I'm very glad that I watched this show and by no means it isn't  a masterpiece but it is a very engaging watch nevertheless.
Plot:
The Premise of FMA:B is a very interesting one, from the very beginning the ideas of alchemy kept me intrigued and I was very curious to learn more about this strange 19th Century
                  World.
Now to talk about the actual plot; the plot follows two brothers, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric. After the death of their mother these brothers try to use alchemy and its rule of equivalent exchange to resurrect their deceased mother, unfortunately this failed horrible for Edward and Alphonse and they lost parts of their bodies. Due to this catastrophic event both Edward and Alphonse set out to find a way to retrieve their bodies whilst facing many obstacles in their journeys.
Art:
The art wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. One of the things that I did appreciate though is that the animation staff put a lot of effort to make the battle scenes look the best, however by no means is it mind blowing. Though as the episodes go the animation starts to get slightly better.
Sound:
The sound was done incredibly well, the soundtrack fits beautifully to the situation of the scene and thus in my opinion the soundtrack helped to heighten the drama when necessary.
Characters:
Now I have a few issues with some of the characters. Due to this being a shounen anime one can assume that there would be a large cast of characters and due to this some characters feel very undeveloped or don't get enough screen time to really make an impact.
I mean certain characters such as Winry or Havock didn't pull any heart strings as they were intended too and i generally didn't really care about their struggles. 
Though don't get me wrong, there were some amazing characters with very good development but surprisingly it wasn't Edward or Alphonse(They were good characters but not the most interesting and most captivating)characters such as Scar, Wrath ,Greed ,Mustang and Hoheheim were truly amazing, they weren't generic and I usually would wonder about their thought process and motivations.
BUT, the one that really STEALS the show in my opinion is Envy, though Envy by no means is a nice person/being but Envy puts a heck of a performance and thus is one of the more intresting antagonist in this series.
Enjoyment:
I truly enjoyed this series, one of its strong aspects is that throughout FMA:B certain philosophical questions would be asked:
Such questions include:
- How valuable is human life?
-Can one mimic God himself and create life?
-Can one suppress God if enough power is obtained?
Unfortunately one thing that irritated me is that the anime would shift from seriousness to comedy gags, this happened a lot in the beginning but less towards the end.
Overall
FMA:B is not the masterpiece it is claimed to be, but it's still a very engaging show
Final Rating:
Story 9/10
Art 7/10
Sound 9/10
Character 7/10
Enjoyment 8/10
Overall 8/10",8

                For first time viewers or people well versed in the FMA universe this is an absolute must watch. The story is incredible and I found it much more to my taste than the original. The series has elements of humour and drama seamlessly integrated and backed by awesome animation and the beyond epic soundtrack. FMA: Brotherhood has me looking forward to each episode almost impatiently and I will be sad to see it end. 10/10 from me :)

                Honestly I don't understand why this anime is so highly rated and praised... I mean it's not a bad anime, but it's no masterpiece, if you were to take both sad scenes of nina and that one dude that died out of the anime, people would score it a lot less. Here are my main issues with the anime:
1) The protagonists don't actually do anything in terms of saving the world from ""father""... they literally have no role to play in ending the war. The whole city was saved by Edwards dad, who had made some sort of reverse circle to send everyone's souls back
                  into their bodies, and the other group that actually contributed to saving people were the Ishvalans who also made some sort of reverse circle to restore everyones magic.
2)The protagonists don't actually have any character development. If you compare FMAB to Shippuden, in Shippuden we can see naruto's journey to learn more techniques and become a more powerful ninja. However is FMAB we don't see any of that, there is no training or development of their magic abilities, it's the exact same kids from episode 1 to episode 64. 
3) there is no mental struggle or questioning of morality on Edwards's or Al's side. If we compare it to Naruto once more, we see Naruto face his own weakness in the Pain Arc, When he meets his Minato he doubts himself and is scared of the burden put on him to save everyone. We also see Naruto change from a boy into a man when he decides to face pain face to face and talk to him. We don't see anything like that in FMAB, Edward convictions stay the same from beginning to end ""lets not use philosopher stones because they take human souls to make and that is bad!"". There is no genuine development of thinking.
4)Edward is constantly getting his ass kicked. One thing I hate more then anything is when an anime gives us a weak ass MC. It really triggers me when the MC that gets his ass handed to him in almost every fight, but what pisses me off even more is when you get the side characters that come to the rescue! LIKE SHIT MAN! JUST LET MY MC KICK SOME ASS FOR ONCE!!!!!! I wouldn't have minded as much if Edward and Al had some sort of training Arc that actually made them powerful or gave them some sort of unique ability to overcome their enemies. which leads me to my next point. 
5) The MC's have NO unique abilities or gifts.... They're literally just regular alchemists just like every other joe shmoe in this world. Had they at least added some evil spirit inside him that made him go bersurk when he was about to die, that would have made the anime so much more entertaining. However we are left to two ordinary boys just travelling around and getting their asses kicked with each fight they come across. 
6) We don't see any of the MC's within the last 10 episodes of the series.... they literally disappear on us. The anime heavily focuses on the Army and the re-taking of the city from the Furor that it completely forgets about Edward and Al. We don't actually see them until like the last 2 episodes when father pretty much was weakened by everyone who isn't an MC, and at the last second Edward gives him a nice punch to the belly that allows all the souls to escape out of father, thereby killing father and ending the conflict. 
My final thoughts, it's not a bad anime, but it's no masterpiece. It takes some forcing to get through it because at times it can get dry and boring. Personally i'm not a fan of alchemy or gun animes so this really wasn't my cup of tea. I personally think the reason it's voted so highly is because it was probably the first anime people have watched and is what is nostalgic to them. But in comparison to what's out there, it doesn't add up to much.",3
"
                You can believe me or not, but thit is so far the best anime, no- the best THING that my eyes have ever seen. What did i like? 
-Characters- there's no such thing as boring or cliche characters here
-soutracks are great, and i hear them even nowadays
-openings are... my 2 most favourites opening come from this anime (4. and 5.)
-plot is literally genious
-i actually cried a lot during 4. episode and after Ray vs Envy fight, also after the burial 
-well, even after ending i was crying- becuase the show was over :/
-original, characteristic and beutiful art style
-tons of humour
-tons of awasome fights-antagonists!
-ending that cannot be disliked
As I sad, 'only one true 10/10' i've given.",10

                **SPOILERS**
This is a pretty good anime. The action in this anime is cool, and there's a lot of blood, but sometimes the story isn't explained very well. There was one character, Ed and Al's dad (Van something) whose personality kept switching throughout the show, and it wasn't explained why. Also, he seemed to keep moving around very quickly, and sometimes they showed him at two different locations at once. But I'm pretty sure there is no alchemy for teleportation, or I would have understood.
Also, I didn't like how Scar suddenly turned good at the end. His character changed too suddenly and it wasn't very natural.
Overall
                  this is still a fun anime to watch, the fight scenes are very nice. Nothing as good as Shingeki no Kyojin, but enjoyable. But it's a shame the story doesn't hold up to analysis because it could've been a lot better too.
I still recommend watching it if you haven't seen it yet!!",8
"
                Okay, so I've seen 38 out of ""x"" episodes of FMA Brotherhood.
I have watched the complete first adaptation of FMA, and I absolutely loved it. So here I am, sucked into the world of Alchemy again.
My first impression during the first 13 or so episodes was: Mediocre. I thought it would never ever compare to the earlier adaptation of FMA. Everything seemed TOO fast paced (First time ever for any anime, they're always too slow!). Just about half of the original story was summed up and told in several episodes. 
I considered dropping this new series, but that just could not do. Edward action is
                  too alluring!
So I watched on, and with each new chapter my appreciation for this series grew. The story wraps together nicely and branches off into the original Manga version without any sort of bumpy transition. 
I'm looking at all the reviews for FMA Brother and people who've rated it like, 6 or 7, are people who have only watched barely 10 episodes of this series. I have to say that you will NOT come to terms with this series unless you get a gist of its pacing and story development.
Now for quick reviews.
Story: 10. I've always loved the old FMA story, and I can't wait to see how the manga one develops (Never read the manga). What saddens me is the lack of involvement with the Homunculi that were VERY significant in the previous FMA.
Art: 10. It's crisp yet very neutral as a result of using pastel tones. Beautiful especially when you watch it on a HD site 8). I like the use of comedy in the art - ex. making Ed into a beany dude with one piece of hair when he's distressed. 
Sound: I like the music, not too picky about this. 
Character: 8. I'm hoping there will be more development of the characters; it was kind of hard to grasp the emotions and personalities of many side characters because the story flows very quickly. Some more feeling/empathy in the people would definitely bump the rating of FMA Brotherhood up for me.
Enjoyment: 10. I definitely love watching this series up to this point. It has NO fillers, and it's just very enjoyable overall because nothing is really BORING and there are many cliffhangers. It rips my heart out to have to stop watching after 3 episodes!
Overall: 9 so far; may change depending on further analysis of this series. 
Go FMA Brotherhood!",9
"
                Nearly every other anime fan I've talked to has recommended this to me. I held off on watching it for a long time though because I usually stick to shorter anime, but now I've finally caved.
I have to admit, it was better than I expected. Not that I expected it to be bad, but well....
Long anime tend to include lots of unnecessary details. Sometimes entire episodes are completely irrelevant to the overall plot. There's also some episodes that feel like they needed something to fill in the space and decided to hire some second graders to write it for them.
FMA: Brotherhood, thankfully, had none of
                  those. They kept the story going without any pauses. I was constantly on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. Everything had its place in the story. Not a single episode passed without contributing to the plot. Hallelujah.
One problem in both long and short anime alike is often the ending. Since a lot of anime are based on manga or light novels, they are sometimes released before the source material is finished. Therefore, the anime may have that fancy ""Completed"" status, but it's actually just waiting for season 2. Which may never happen anyway, if the initial release isn't popular enough. Of course, there are also endings that are just plain bad, either leaving too much hanging or just not being well-written.
FMA: Brotherhood, again, did not have this problem in the slightest. The ending it gave was definite, conclusive, fulfilling, and, as if the writers were answering my prayers, happy. I hope that's not too much of a spoiler. I've seen a lot of good anime with endings that literally bring tears to my eyes. That's not a bad thing; on the contrary, that means it was really well-written. But I personally prefer happy endings.
In conclusion, if you're like me and are hesitant to watch anime longer than 50 episodes, don't worry. This anime is worth the time. Watch it. You won't regret it.",9
"
                Their are very few series that left me with a smile on my face and allowing me to gladly say that Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood easily beat the original and every other anime i watched up to this point. after rewatching it i can easily tell you my opinion on this masterpiece.
Story 10/10 Outstanding
The story of FMA wasn't entirely focused on these two brothers, at its core it was hohenhiem who was so critical to the events of the story. although many people leave the anime loving it but not quite understand the whole concept and story of the series. (That includes myself) I mean it
                  would pack the entire history of the world in one episode. In terms of the plot the series also delivered. I never would have guessed half the things that the series revealed to us. The very heritage of the main characters, the conspiracy behind the very formation of Amestris and how unbelievably badass King Bradley is.
Art 10/10 Outstanding 
Visually the series was beautiful. It certainly needed a high level of quality for some of the battles and alchemy being shown off. I mean we have fire, swords, rock manipulation, shadow attacks, hand to hand combat, guns, tanks, etc. Everything was pretty smooth.
Sound 10/10 outstanding 
A big part of the series was the music which was AMAZING! for the series. I didn’t have a complaint about any of the OP/ED combinations that this 64 episode series gave us. Considering they used quite a few over the course of the series.
Character 10/10 Outstanding 
Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Scar, Greed, Ling Yao, May Chang, etc. In terms of characters Brotherhood gets an A+ since there were so many good ones that anyone who watches the series could have different top 5s. In terms of action a lot of characters outside the main leads got serious battle
Enjoyment 10/10 outstanding
The series has some extremely dark and sad moments but also has its share of funny and epic moments.
Overall 10/10 outstanding
I may have gave 10/10 for every criteria but it deserves every single one of them no part of this series disappointed me",10

                As someone who is fairly new to anime, I wasn’t really sure on what show I should watch, and with over 12,000 anime titles, it was hard to pick something to follow through on. Then came Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. I was recommended this series in March 2015 by a friend, but it didn’t get around to it until May 2016, and I’ll be honest, I’m starting to kick myself for not getting onto this series earlier.
I’ll try not to spoil too much for you guys who haven’t watched this yet, and bear in mind, I’ve never read the manga, so Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was the
                  first time I was exposed to this solid story. Two brothers, Ed and Al Elric on a mission to get their mum back through the use of alchemic powers, but then sh*t happens; one loses their body, the other an arm and a leg. They end up uncovering all sorts of mysteries going down in their country, Amestris. That’s all I can say on the matter without spoiling it, but expect a lot of action, bloodshed and conspiracy.
I gotta hand it to Hiromu Arakawa for this story and the way the anime writing team adapted it in the series; It flowed almost seamlessly as if the viewers were being exposed to real-time events taking place in the world, and among all of the action and countless loss of lives, it felt pretty realistic. That’s right, not keeping characters on to do justice to fans, the unexpected turn of events in the story, and a very clear and believable issue of life and humans being portrayed. There were also some light-hearted elements to ensure you weren’t too depressed from watching this, and I thought witty banter, unexpected jokes and sarcasm added to the overall value of the show. I lost count of the amount of times the episodes in this series left me thinking “holy sh*t”, “Why him/her” or “god, that was amazing”, or even make me laugh a bit. 
As a writer, I was impressed to see the vast amount out characters in this show, but also on top of that, each character was given just the right amount of exposure for you to cling on to them. I hate to compare, but thinking about some of the mediocre cartoons I watched when I was a kid, many secondary characters in some series don’t get a lot of possible on-screen time, and writers could have used them to an advantage to the overall story they were telling, and the writing team for Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood did just that; for that, well done.
In terms of animation, Bones anime studio did a fantastic job on the this, from the realistic set designs and well-drawn characters, to the epic alchemic action scenes and transformation sequences. I’m familiar with the anime studio’s recent works, Akagami no Shirayukihime (Snow White with the Red Hair), which they did a good job on the setting, but I would admit it was not as great as the effort they put into increasing the believe factor of the viewers for this series’ animation.
Akira Senju did incredibly well with the soundtrack for this series and deserves every bit of praise for it. The music made every bit of this anime more immersive, and even though you may hear some of the songs again (as expected for anime), no matter how classical it is, I bet you will end up singing along with it. I’m not a fan of classical music, but for this soundtrack, I surely enjoyed every piece.
Sub or Dub? I watched the FUNimation dub to this series. I’m not a sub watcher, and I’ve heard a lot from a few anime fans discouraging dubs in general. However, watching the dubbed version of this, who can argue the fact that the voice acting is just golden? Vic Mignogna and Maxey Whitehead did an absolutely stellar job on portraying Ed and Al Elric, along with many of the well-known names in the dubbing business: Ed Baylock, Colleen Clinkenbeard, J Michael Tatum, Todd Haberkorn, Travis Willingham and Chris Sabat, to name just a few, absolutely smashed it. So many of the greatest voice actors were put on the characters to bring each character to life the proper way, and I’ve got to thank FUNimation for their efforts.
While I have praised this series, it does come with its slight downsides. Earlier I did mention there was some light-heated jokes that were injected into the series, but I personally felt the timing of the jokes in some episodes took away from the overall seriousness of the story at hand, which really did affect my standpoint on whether the matter of Ed and Al fighting to get their limbs and bodies back was a serious one, or one where it was preferable, but not important.
Another thing I can’t help but criticise was the way some character emotions were portrayed in the show. In my opinion, I do think that some character emotions, such as anger, shyness and agitation, were over-exaggerated unnecessarily in the animation. I do get that this might have been done to conform with the style of anime and may have been an added value to the light-heatedness of the series, but this was something I wasn’t too jolly about, and maybe could have been toned down a little to make sure the story isn’t taken for granted.
To conclude, I’ll say this: as any other fan guy would say, “there should be more”, which may be want I want from an anime of this calibre, deep down I truly believe this anime is one of those series that is best left as it is: nothing more, nothing less. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is, without a doubt, a well-told, captivating and brilliant anime series, that every action-craver, whether you’re into anime or not, should at least make the effort to watch.",10

                I've said it for a long time that Fullmetal Alchemist is the Star Wars of anime.
By which I mean, It's over-hyped.It tries to do too many things, and doesn't stick to one proper theme, which completely makes the show seem completely disorganized and kinda pointless.I get neither a light hearted nor a serious feel, neither funny nor dramatic.
FMA:B has a pretty great story and decent pacing but poor exposition.The world building is half assed, and has no solidity.I personally, am not a great fan of it because of the vagueness of the storyline.Nothing is explained in detail and many parts of the story are weak,
                  but it has some great moments.
The character development is where it mainly lost me.The characters seem clichéd, and predictable(same feeling as star wars).There's not much effort made to build their characters.I would even enjoy the show if they had no characters, or traits or any development and the anime just concentrated on the plot.But it wasn't like that and the job was done poorly.Basically, the character building is not good.
I liked the art.It wasn't anything that made me swoon, but it was great with few superb visuals.The sound was more attractive to me than the art.Amazing VAs and great soundtracks.
Overall, While I liked the story, art and sound,The story had a few weaknesses and the characters were shoddy. It has its moments, but it's nowhere near the ""Best Anime ever made"".",7

                A Generalized Review of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
Initial Review for Newcomers: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a dark, action adventure that focuses on the Elric brothers' quest to regain what they had lost. This anime has good character development and a greater view of the world that the brothers live in. Like its predecessor, the themes of sacrifice, hardship/struggle, risk, maturity, morality and death are still ever present.
Dub or Sub?: Both. Although, I do find the English dub team to be the greater of the two. Each voice actor sounded like they were born for their roles.
Story/Characters (10/10): Okay, where do I even start? If you've seen
                  the first Fullmetal Alchemist then you know the situation I'm in when writing this review.
The Story: The story is centered around the grand adventure of Elric Brothers. If I say anymore, it will just spoil the show since there are no filler episodes.
The Elric Brothers: The Brothers, Edward and Alphonse, are on a quest of both atonement and discovery. Over the course of the show, the brothers are forced to grow up fast when they faced many problems that challenge their morals and ideals which govern their actions. Along their journey they meet many people who either help or hinder their quest. Eventually, they will later find that their problems are not the only ones that need fixing.
The Supporting Cast Members: consist of over 30 characters so I'm not even going to get started on describing them all. Lets just say that they are all good in their own right.
Art/Animation (10/10): The art/animation is modern. So there's not much to complain about.
Sound/Music (10/10): The sound/music was good. The opening and ending theme songs were acceptable for my taste.
Enjoyment (10/10): I thoroughly enjoyed it. This anime is a must watch for everyone.
Summary/Overall (10/10): The story is great. The character development is great (considering the number of characters involved) and the amount of satisfaction is enormous. After that, feel free to watch the side-story Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos.

                To be Honest, the story isnt bad, but my experience was bad to the bone.
I just finished watching the Original Full Metal Alchemist Anime and loved it. 
I didnt like the Artstyle in Brotherhood nor did I like the different storyline 
(it gets a 7 in story anyway because it's closer to the Manga so I've heard so it gets some bonus points there.) 
The soundtrack was nothing memorable for me and the Characters are kinda interesting but I still dont like them. (Both 5/10)
In terms of enjoyment I'll give this Anime a 1/10 that's just my Opinion. 
Overall Rating is a 4 for me.
                  
It is a Decent show, but unless All other Anime would Vanish overnight I wouldnt bother rewatching.",4
"
                This is an anime that really spoke to peoples hearts. even tho if someone hasnt watched the 2003 version theyll have a hard time getting through the first 12-13 episodes.
STORY  10 / 10: its about alchemy, you cant go wrong. the story of brotherhood is complete, with many philosophical thoughts. its a 10/10 for a reason
ART  9 / 10 : amazing art style, not the best animation ive seen, but great one nevertheless. the viewpoint changes quite ofter during the fights which makes it have more suspense. the art style is beautiful and unique and the animation is detailed. one of the best,
                  but not n.1
SOUND  8 / 10 : the soundtracks are beautiful (even tho ""brothers"" was the best FMA soundtrack and im sad it didnt make it to FMAB). they might be overplayed, but personally i liked that. the openings are one of the best, again by yui and chemistry by period were epic.
CHARACTERS 9 / 10 : oh boy. the character development of brotherhood is good, but the character development of the original fma was EPIC. then he reboot was made, the animators and directors thought that whoever would watch FMAB has already seen FMA. dont get me wrong, the character development is great, but not as awesome as FMA.
ENJOYMENT  10 / 10 : outstanding
VOICE ACTING  10 / 10 : AMAZING !!!!!!!. both the english and japanese dub were epic
NEGATIVES: for people who havent watched FMA 2003 (the original) theyll find the first 13 episodes really hard to go through. its rushed.
OVERALL : 10 / 10",10

                Synopsis:
Alchemy is the art of transforming matter. However in order to create something, the alchemist has to present something of equal value; this is the golden rule of alchemy. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the story of two brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric who are in search of a philosopher's stone, so that they can get back their bodies after a botched experiment with alchemy, in which Edward loses his arm and his leg and has to transmute Alphonse’s soul (which lost its body,) to a suit of armor when they tried to resurrect their mother after she died from a disease.
Pros: 
Brilliantly highlight the characteristics
                  of the main characters.
The visuals are stunning, with beautiful character designs and animation.
The music for the most part good; in some instances beautiful.
The characters are always true to their personalities and characteristic.
Action scenes: Masterful; the cherry on top of all the other great qualities.
The symbolism  makes you wonder if this is anime or poetry?
Cons:
For fans of the manga, the anime doesn't follow it 1:1 and left out a few characters.
Has a different ending than ending than the FMA (2003) of you prefered that one.",9
"
                This is one of the most perfect animes I have seen to date.
There are discrepancies and unexplained matters, including the main characters, but still the whiole series is golden. Honestly, at times the storyline and images are gross and gory, but if you can watch through all that, you will be able to enjoy all this series has got to offer.
Story:9
The story is amazing and full of surprises, though at times it is kinda sick and inconsistent. But honestly, there is a lot of logic and emotions filled throughout this series so I would say that this is one of the best storylines I have
                  seen. There's a lot of sacrifices, love and a general outlook of our modern world. But it is filled too with hope, especially with the Elric Brothers, and the possibilities of what humans can do.
For real life reference, we can refer to what happened to the SARS outbreak, when people all over the world united to fight the airborne deadly diesease. But on a sadder note, when the issue only affects a certain part of people's lives, like how the Ishbalan conflict didn't impact most of the Asmetris' people lives, they did not really care about what happened. This could be referenced to the Ebola virus crisis happening now or other proxy wars fought during the Cold War and so on.
Despite the realistic references, there were also quite a lot of logical theories like the law of equivalent exchange for alchemy, though it involved a lot of fantasy as well. I felt that the fantasy in this series is what makes things interesting. Just when you think that all hope is lost, there could be another way of looking at things, and to use alchemy. I love how the producers and mangaka streatch the imagination with new possibilities.
Art:10
The studio producing this anime is Bones, so it is quite obvious that most of the action is fluid and good, though there were some blur parts. But the colour is good, not faded out or watery-looking but solid, and animation is really good. The characters' art were also well done and consistent.
Sound:10
Although I did not enjoy some OPs and EDs, (the first and last OPs and EDs were my favs), most if not of them fit the current storylines at that time. Plus the OSTs and sound effects enhanced the scenes they were played on too.
Character:10
I think that most of the characters were well-developed and some of the side characters even were part of the main storyline even if they initially were small roles. I like how the small characters influence the Elric Brothers and how the 2 of them changed as they encounted new people and events. The other characters, especially the main characters also had some develiopment, whether through past or actions, and fully showed that a good cast of characters can make a series shine.
Enjoyment:10
Well, I didn't enjoy the sad or gory parts a lot, but this series is unbelievably touching and thought-provoking, even inspiring. However, there was also funny moments and lots of scenes to laugh.
Overall:10
This is a masterpiece, definitely one of the best action and shounen anime series these few years, what with all the fanservice and filler animes recently. In these 64 episodes, it is hard to believe how much real and good content has been shown. The other anime that gave me this feeling is Sword Art Online, but mainly the first 12 or so episodes for the first arc.",10
"
                Well, there has been a huge war deciding which is better: FMA or FMA Brotherhood? What is my opinion? You will find at the end of this review. But for now, lets bring this review back to life with alche-OH MY GOD!!!
Story (10/10) Much better paced than the original. Very unique story. But the story here is based entirely off of the manga. Which means NO FILLER!!! YAAAY!!! Don't watch Naruto, Bleach, One Piece or anything like that. Watch this instead. Its MUCH better. The first 13 episodes might go very slowly for watchers of the original series, but after that, it picks up, and
                  starts driving. And the ride sure is a long and fun one.
Art (10/10) Its breathtaking. There is so much detail put in, but the action scenes look SPECTACULAR! I mean, this came out in 2009/2010. 7 years ago. And it looks better than most shows that come out today.
Sound (10/10) The soundtrack is very good, the openings are all great (except for opening 2, not my favorite) and the ending themes are surprisingly all great. But the best part is the voice acting. Especially in the dub. The voices are just perfect for each character. This proves that Funimation is the best English dubbing company out there. 
Characters (11/10) Incredible. Without a doubt, the characters are what make the Fullmetal Alchemist series so special. Especially in Brotherhood. Every character is useful in some way. Almost every character develops. Even Greed. EVEN FREAKING GREED! The one character I hated from FMA 2003, I love him in brotherhood. He actually DEVELOPS A PERSONALITY!!!! Just.....mind blown. 
Enjoyment (9.5/10) Well for watchers of the original FMA, the first 13 episodes will go by very slowly. But after that, the series is a MASTERPIECE. YOU WILL ENJOY THE CRAP OUT OF IT. I PROMISE YOU. IN FACT, STOP READING THIS REVIEW. GO WATCH IT RIGHT NOW!!! RIGH-
Pros: 
+The story is excellently done.
+The animation is incredibly fluid and nice.
+Great voice acting!!!!!!! AMAZING ENGLISH DUB!!!!
+Outstanding characters
+The Opening and Ending themes.
+You always want more
+The ending will make you cry.
Cons:
-Slow start
Neutral: You may have to watch the original FMA before Brotherhood to understand certain things better
So if I had to choose between FMA 2003 and Brotherhood, the winner is: Both. They are both just as good as each other. But I recommend you watch the original first, because if you watch Brotherhood first, you wont be able to enjoy the original as much.
Overall: 9.8",10

                This reveiw was written after 4 episodes watched: (Will update later)
(THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO WATCHED FMA 1 ALREADY! SOME PART MAY SPOIL PEOPLE WHO NEVER WATCHED)
Story: 6
 I can't say much about the story since the series only started by 4 episodes and more are needed for better explaination. However, judging from this four episodes the Famous Full Metal Alchemist (Although Season 1 ending was dissapointed) has come back with a bang, throwing people off guard. Our (ahem) Small, brave, smart and arrogant Edward Elric is back with his awesome alchemy with his (ahem) Big, just and kind Brother Alphonse Elric. The
                  story does start good, but when the rerun of some similar episodes from the First season happened the interest in watching may fall down a lot. If the story still continues on like this 6 is the maximun I can give.
Art: 10
 Like the First Season, Season two doesn't dissapoint us with any crappy drawing at all. Instead, the drawing looks more better and more realistic (although some parts still not).
Sound: 10
 The opening and the ending of FMA never cease to amaze the viewers. Their OP and ED does go along with the story and become the starter/dessert before the story starts/end. The effects (e.g. Ice cracking, footstep, blast attack, slashing) were all input and thus pull us into the story.
Character: 6
 Like Story I can't evaluate the character yet with only 4 episodes watched. Overall from FMA 1 is a 10, but there's chance that the second season will be worse than the first. Only time will tells. (For anyone who still interest in reading the character now read FMA 1 review)
Enjoyment: 9
 Alchemy, is to change the elements of the substance from one form to another and from that form may also turned into another. This idea is already much to sastified the viewers with their used of Alchemy (e.g.: Change Water to Ice then boil ice or melt ice and chance it back to water) Another thing that will make people enjoy is their plot, which can twist and turn like a vine. However, the plot will still have to looks throughout the second season.
Overall: 7
 A good starting, If FMA 2 can power up it's story the character will goes up by itself. If they can really suceed in making an awesome story for episodes and finish with an epic ending then this serie should deserve a 10. If...",7
"
                Watching this anime had definitely been the biggest disappointment I have ever watched. 
The things I heard about this show is that this show is ""the best shounen off all time"" and similar praises. But after watching it, they could not be more wrong in my opinion. 
In my opinion, people give this anime much more credit than it deserves.
If I had to name one thing about the that I dislike the most about this show, I would definitely have to say the over usage of dramatic irony, which honestly ruins the entire show. You'll know certain a twist in the show, but it will
                  take multiple episodes for the characters to know and it's honestly really boring. Entire episodes are spent trying to figure out something, but you as the watcher already knows what gonna happen, so I have no idea how people see this show as exiting.
I also have to criticize the anime's pacing, because honestly the show is really slow until 2/3rds of the way through the show and there's barely any meaningful action at all until then, and it honestly didn't feel like an anime at all up until that point. 
Also, people tend to say that this show has good underlying themes, but I could honestly names other shows that have done it better :P.",1
"
                This was my first anime:
I was never into anime; never ever has anime been an interest of mine. A friend told me I should really watch it because it was genuinely a good show. So i see its on Netflix and give it a try....
HOLY SHIT. This show is great in comparison to any show on TV. Pacing is phenomenal (which I value greatly). Characters are great. Comic relief is abundant. Great fight scenes. amazing concept (alchemy). Intellectual. Story was amazing. I finished it in like 3-4 days if that poses as any indication as to how good the show is.
This has gotten me into
                  anime and now I'm watching a couple other shows.
Stop avoiding this show, start it now. I promise it will not disappoint.
Also I watched it dubbed which was great in my opinion, but apparently the anime community is fairly adamant about subs over dubs. For any first time anime viewers who are more comfortable with hearing it in English I promise you it didn't dilute the quality of the series
P.S Netflix only has the first 52 episodes so you gotta go watch the rest somewhere else. And I promise you those last 12 episodes you will not want to miss.",10
"
                In my short time watching anime. I have watched a few 'popular series'. Such as 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' and 'Cowboy Bebop'. These series floored me on their story, characters and overall tone, But none like this series. This series is of course is Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
Everything to the characters, animation and style of the series it is all handled with such excellent directing which is why I love it. Lets start with the characters.  Each character in this anime is essential to the anime. Not once did I not enjoy a characters presence in a anime series. They were all so much fun to
                  watch and all add to the final conclusion in some way. Next, animation. The animation for this series for this series is done by 'Bones' and is solid. Everything to the back-drops, character design and of course the mouth watering fight scenes. These fights were so fluent that they oozed  of the screen with awesome-ness.
If you are an anime fan, I implore you to watch this anime. You can also watch the original because it is also excellent. Overall, just stop what you are doing and watch this anime, It is what got me into anime and I hope it has the same effect on you.",10
"
                The story had me hooked from the very beginning. This anime had everything I was looking for in perfection- an amazing story, a beautiful soundtrack, great visuals, and more. I love how it swings from ridiculous and hilarious situations in the story to sudden and serious situations and back. This anime had a great way to keep me hooked; if I could erase my memory and rewatch this anime, I would do it. It also had one of the best endings ever. The emotion it invoked out of its viewers was humor, shock, some sadness, and overall happiness. There are some characters that are lovable,
                  some that are loathsome, but all of them contributed to keep the story entertaining. There was not a single moment that wasn't memorable. Everything that happened in this anime feels like a dangerous, scary, but fun adventure.",10
"
                This is way better than the original anime. This one follows the manga perfectly, unlike the original. The story's great. Two brothers fight to find the philosopher's stone, the one thing that can bring them back to normal, but they soon learn that there is a great secret in Central. It ( in my opinion) one of the best animes around, it has good action, comedy and lots of plot twists. I would recommend this to people who enjoy these things 
              ",10

                I have watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist series and the Brotherhood one. What I like about this anime is that the storyline is somewhat different from the original series. The story is really enjoyable with a few twists here and there. FMAB has the best openings in my opinion. Also the villains stand out there, they are based of sins so it's quite interesting to watch how they are presented in the actual story. If someone haven't watched this anime yet I suggest you do: It has great art and music, the characters are well presented and the story line is just amazing.

"
                I don't know if I can write an effective review for how good this anime is.
The storyline is intriguing and unique.  The plot moves at the perfect rate, almost no filler.  This show kept me guessing and I simply couldn't turn it off.  I had to know why a character was acting a certain way, what their motives were, and what they were doing next.
The characters are flawless.  They're diverse and well-rounded.  There's no one-dimensional characters here.  The ""bad guys"" have good qualities, and the ""good guys"" have done terrible, atrocious things.  Nothing is black-and-white.  I found
                  myself getting attached to all of them in different ways, without realizing it until it had already happened.
The intercharacter relationships are beautiful and deep.  You can feel the bonds between them.
This anime has it all.  Depth, humor, seriousness, sorrow, joy, frustration, love.  It looks into what it means to be human, and what some people will do to preserve the notion of humanity.  It also seriously touches on the issue of what makes a family a ""family"" and it does it in a subtle and not at all cliche way.
I would recommend this anime to everyone.  Period.",10

                i was expecting a lot more from this i think they didn't worked enough on the sequel i rated story as 5 because they aren't making anything different i expected a lot more from that big desapointment (worst desapointment so far :P) i realy hope it guets better the Art is still realy good so i rated as 9 the sound is 8/9 i dont thing i have to coment on that the character rated as 9, they have a lot of personality and i have nothing against that. Enjoyment i rated as 6 because i dnt see any innovation about that, that gives a

                DISCLAIMER: i have not watched the 2003 FMA, but i intend to do so after this review. maybe that’ll change my perspective on the whole thing.
for all intents and purposes, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood SHOULD be a great anime, if not a perfect one. 
it has pristine and polished animation, a bombastic score, a whole slew of characters that are all interesting in their own right and contribute to the overarching plot, the story’s pace never slogs with “filler”, every episode is dedicated to either fleshing out characters/the world or progressing the story, the voice acting is incredible (in the dub AND sub, major kudos to
                  the seiyuus), and at the end, every character and subplot is tied up in a satisfying, neat little bow. 
it has every single element to become the perfect show, nay, to truly be an experience that matches the praise and calibre heaped upon it by the anime community at large.
so why then did i leave this show feeling so empty? 
i don’t feel like the Elric brothers, who watched in gleeful anticipation as all the meticulously-measured and precise elements for a human being, were mixed in an alchemic slurry, only to be left in devastating disappointment when the end result was a horrible monstrosity, no,
i just feel like nothing at play here really rose above and beyond what it could have been; it all feels TOO perfect, TOO polished.
seeing how this is a remake of an earlier show that has a reputation of being imperfect, i can totally see the production’s attitude going into this anime, with every intent of fixing every wrong, of catering to the wants and needs of fans to make the ultimate show. 
but it’s that underlying attitude that, ironically, is FMA:B’s greatest hubris. 
nothing in the show has any bite.
sure, the animation is stunning, the plot engaging enough, the characters fun to watch fight and interact and grow, but it just
it all just feels color by number. 
deus ex machina here, emotional character beat there, hints of a larger otherworldly force here, dark character revelation there.
speech of how killing people is bad, unlikely rivals forgiving each other and teaming up, huge final battle where every character path interweaves and collides and explodes in a euphoric climax. 
it’s all very glitzy and functions perfectly as a show, but man.
i don’t know. 
i had fun, but i’m left with a tart aftertaste, like vanilla soft serve from Yogurtland. it’s just.
it’s good. it’s fine. there’s enough edge in it that kept me on my toes, enough badass moments that had me giddy, enough world building that had me coming back to learn more, just ENOUGH. 
believe me, there is nothing new that i can say about this show: FMA:B’s reputation more than precedes it. i do agree that all of its trace elements, all of the components, moving gears, whathaveyou of the show are pretty much perfect, all of it working together in harmony from start to finish without a single stuttering step. 
but at the end, it just feels all too NEAT. not formulaic, mind you, just, too polished, too meticulous. as if it were created with the vision of focus groups instead of a single person, or a single, passionate writer’s group.
 everything and everyone in the story is a subservient slave to the anime’a plot and subsequent ending. nothing is allowed to breathe on its own. screentime feels like it’s allotted for just the RIGHT amount of time for character development. it ends up feeling wonky, unnatural, planned.
it’s the same feeling i got when i walked out of Avengers: Infinity War (or most other MCU films, for that matter); i say to myself or my friends, “wow, that was pretty great. ...yup...pretttyyy great.” and then that’s it. that’s the end of my pondering, my digging. i appreciate lots of the things it does, how everything clicks together so minutely and so perfectly, but nothing beyond that, no dissecting, no deep analysis.
everything is just given to me at face value, so my evaluation of said work extends as such.
so yeah, idk if comparing it to the MCU makes much sense if you feel like the MCU is a masterpiece-making machine like everyone else does, but hey, maybe that makes my point all the more relevant.
in the end, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood feels like an alchemic ritual. you take all this shit, and BOOM, instant gold, right?
well yeah, that’s genuine whatever karat gold sitting there, it just doesn’t have the lustre everyone else is hyping it up to have. 
it’s just barely a sum of its parts, lacking the bite nor the balls to truly become a gestalt.",6

                This is perhaps the best anime I have ever seen in my entire life. Though I was very skeptical about it at first, given the fact that I'd grown up hearing about Fullmetal Alchemist and expecting it to be a kid's show, and the fact that the artwork in this anime is a little... different from that of ""classical"" anime styles, I was a bit reluctant to start watching it. Then my friend finally convinced me and I saw episode one. And I was hooked. 
The story is original. Though there are many themes that various anime/manga share in general, this story is absolutely fascinating
                  in its complexity. FMAB is also good because it follows the original manga, as opposed to the 2003 version, so it's slightly more coherent and has a lot more likable and wholesome characters. 
The music in this show deserves an award, it's so good and so fitting that it's impossible think of anything better. All the OP's and ED's are amazing, but even the OST is absolutely perfect. I have all of them on my computer and I listen to them on repeat from time to time. 
The characters are very well rounded and complex, most of them have back stories that are engaging and relatable. You will be able to identify with at least one of them, I can guarantee you. 
Overall, this anime is one of the classics, and it is rightfully so. I don't think I would ever enjoy another anime as much as I have enjoyed this one.",10
"
                I  am in love and obsessed with this anime.  It's by far the greatest anime I've ever seen.  I would suggest it to everybody even if they don't watch anime.  This anime is hilarious but it does have their sad moments which really just moves you.  It stayed on the plot and didn't stray out to some other story.  I love all the characters especially the antagonists.  I would rate this a 10/10.

                This review probably contain spoilers. 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is without a doubt the worst crap I ever wasted my time on. I can't complain much about the sound or art. It was good. 
Why this anime has the top spot on myanimelist is a complete mystery to me. I'm repulsed by many of the characters. Too many of them. 
The bad guys in Fullmetal are quite typical of what we expect in these types of anime. They are supernatural beings without any regard for human life. Humans are nothing but tools in their quest for power. This is nothing new. These kind of villains are
                  often quite entertaining. 
The problem lies with the so-called ""good"" guys: Mustang, Hughes, Hawkeye, Armstrong, Marcoh and many more. I think we are supposed to root for them as they assist Ed and Al in preventing the bad guys from winning. But they are worse than the bad guys. All of them willingly participated in a war of ethnic cleansing. And they all did it knowing it was wrong. They are no better than the nazis who assisted in the Holocaust. I wouldn't mind any of this, if they weren't portrayed as the heroes in this anime. 
Who have we got left? Scar. I like him, but he has killed innocent people in his quest for revenge. Yao was quite entertaining until he chose to become a monster in an attempt to secure power for his clan. Then we have Edward and Winry, who both take turns sobbing their eyes out. In each and every episode, at least one of them have a big crying scene. Left is Alphonse. He's ok. 
If i had managed to watch beyond episode 30 or 31, I would have been forced to root for ""Father"" and his creations. The problem is, I only found one or two of the Homunculi entertaining. Nowhere near enough to keep me watching.",1

                Story: 6/10
I had really high expectations, i mean its Number 1 in MAL. it was such a frustrating Expirience. i was like WHAT? THATS IT. I really want to like it but NO just NO. I was most of the time while watching  FMAB really  bored. i dont get it why people give it a 10/10. This Show does objectively everything right and this is where the problem lies. The Author didn´t go out of her  way to create something  that is unique. She rather went the safe route. it wasnt a thrilling expirience. every thing FMAB does, doesnt feel fresh.
                  it feels like i have seen all this somewhere before. like the concept of the 7 deadly sins. there are shows who already used this. though i liked the use of alchemy as a combat system.
Alphonse and Edward did use Human Transmutation to get her mother back and as this is bound by equivalent exchange they had to give something and this was alphonses whole body and edwards  right arm. And therefor they are in search of a way to get their bodys back. i could relate because they did something without knowing what the consequences would be and i myself did stuff without knowing that it will have some bad backlash.
Character: 6/10
The only Character that made an impression on me was King Bradley. Every time he was on screen it  was so intense. Most of the characters felt generic and had like one quirk or so.
Art: 8/10
I liked most of the chracterdesigns. they were different from eachother. Animation Studio Bones delivers once again with FMAB. The visuals where really detailed and crisp. The fights were also very fluid and smooth.
Sound: 8/10
There are some great OSTs. They are also really memorable pieces. Also the OPs and EDs are very good.
Enjoyment: 5/10
I was bored most of the time it didnt brought something new to the table. it was a mediocre expirience.
Overall: 6,6=7/10",7

                I am so glad I watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist series before I watched this, or else I wouldn't have been able to watch it after I watched this one. This anime is said to be an anime will absolutely no fillers, so it gets to the point and continues to build up the story without and let downs or unnecessary distractions. The art is wonderful and the story, which follows the manga much more closely than the original series, is enthralling! I watched it seeing that it was similar to the alternative series in many ways only to be caught off-guard after a short
                  while to find out that the story was taking a much different turn than the first.
This series isn't ranked #1 on MyAnimeList for no reason. This is one anime that is highly recommended to most newbies to the anime world and even to those who haven;t watched it as yet, so i think it goes without saying that I also recommend. As for the original series that came out before this, if you are to watch it, I recommend watching that one before this one and not the other way around.
Hope you enjoy!",10

                I know there are probably like a million reviews of this particular anime out there already, but I watched this a few months back and I just felt the need now to share my opinion about it. 
At first I was really repellent to watch this anime. I was denying and avoiding it, but after a friend's consent, I finally sat and took some time watching it.
On the beginning of the first episode I was feeling like ""wtf am I watching"", and I was really close to stop watching it. But after a few episodes, when the story picked up(note: I still hadn't had any
                  near - ideas what was going on in the anime) I took a liking to it. Edward and Alphonse were quite amusing to watch. The anime goes from the realm of comedy to a whole another. So, if you think that it's not worth watching for the first few episodes, give it a chance, it gets better.
Eventho it was released in 2009, the animation was quite good actually. The characters, the fights and everything along was pretty well animated, and I wouldn't have changed a thing about it.
Now, the thing that really made me think this anime was actually one of the best there is out there, is the actual story. I've watched about a 100 anime, and I've never seen a story this good. Once you get in a bit deeper, around the 15th episode, you just get hooked and can't get out of it. Until I reached about the 15th episode, I was literally making myself watch it. After that, it all went so smooth, I couldn't stop it. I finished the rest of the series(about 50 episodes) in about three days. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the characters' background is just amazing. It really is up to the individual to decide which of the characters has the best background, but as I've seen it, all of them are pretty wicked. 
They've coordinated the soundtracks with the scenes so good aswell, I literally can't point out a single thing about this anime, except that it's a bit slow maybe. But seriously, watching it gave me the experience that just a few other animes gave me, and by that, cheers to FMAB!",10

                While this is a shounen series, it’s one of the few popular shounen titles that doesn’t revolve around repetitive and moderately episodic battling. I’m not saying that shows like Fairy Tail, Dragon Ball Z, and Pokemon don’t have merit - this just happens to go above and beyond in terms of story-telling, emotional impact, characterization, and theme.
Having broken the laws of alchemy in a failed attempt to bring their recently deceased mother back to life, two brothers pay a heavy price, a price of flesh. Thus begins their journey for redemption- to become truly powerful alchemists and gain back that which was lost. A journey
                  which will lead them to unexpected places, unexpected truths, and embroil them in conflict much larger then they ever imagined.
FMA:B has plenty of comic relief, but for the most part doesn’t pull its punches. It deals in life and death, responsibility, sacrifice, power, racism, war, and revenge - all contributing to a classic coming of age story. It’s dark enough thematically to appeal to the more serious viewer, while still being action packed enough to hold the attention of the typical shounen audience.
With 64 episodes, there’s plenty of time to give the characters histories and develop them throughout the story- even many of secondary characters and villains. You won’t find “bwahahahaha” cardboard baddies, or characters for the sake of characters here. As in any great piece of story telling, you’ll find things to like and dislike about every character. The people in the show will feel real to you, and you’ll care about the things they go through. Naturally, 64 episodes is also plenty of time for twists and turns, and nail biting suspense.
*I originally posted this to my Tumblr, because I'm discussing favorite shows with a friend over there. Thought I'd post it up as a short and sweet review.",9
"
                So FMA: Brotherhood. I'm not going to win any friends with this one. This show is one of the most overrated anime I have ever watched. Though it's still enjoyable and good... it is nowhere deserving the top spot on any list. I don't even think that's subjective, I think objectively, this show does not deserve that rating. It shouldn't. And let's get into why;
Story:
The story starts off horribly, fragmented, and weird. The odd one off - ice character that really doesn't have much presence other than a showpiece. Actually it's all he is really. Just to show off and showcase the main characters. It
                  drops the whole first 20 some episodes of the first show (2003), but the world is still the same and they expect you to know and care about the characters as if you've watched the 2003 show. That might be great if you've seen the first show. But what if you haven't?
You wouldn't understand the whole Youswell arc. You would look at Yoki and go ""who the hell is this guy... why is the show talking as if I know him? Why does the show expect me to care about him?"" Cornello was basically glossed over, Reole is randomly shown in FMA: Brotherhood as if we're supposed to care and understand the depth of the characters around the city. The show just starts so bad, it's choppy, it's without proper introduction... maybe if the show started off just taking the 2003 anime and cutting/editing the first 3 or 4 chapters into an introduction, maybe it would be better.
But after that, the story does get a lot better. I know it's sacrilege to ever criticize Brotherhood, but the starting is crap and the fact it tries to make you care about characters you have no effing idea who they are, that's terrible. When a show fails to actually develop some PIVOTAL key characters and rely on another show or the manga for you to know what is going on, that's a failure of its story. The whole time I watched this show I just kept thinking about how bad the introduction etc was. I kept thinking ""oh I remember them from 2003"" and going ""wow, they absolutely didn't explain that at all.""
There are also some issues in the FMA exclusive story after the two fork. For example, when they go up north... the whole story is a jumbled mess. Characters act brain dead, the person in charge of the fortress is supposed to be one thing but constantly just serves Ed and Alphonse for some inexplicable reason. They literally hand everything to them on a silver platter all while the show is trying to make you think she is being hardline and mean. She really isn't though... I don't get how anyone likes this part of the story. It's just so badly paced and poorly written. After they get out of the fortress the story improves a lot.
Compared to the 2003 the ending is better. Though it gets pretty effin corny in a couple of spots and what they try to play as dramatic becomes corny. Which brings me to my main gripe with Brotherhood's story.
TONAL SHIFTS. In some of the most beautifully written emotionally crushing moments that are depressing or just painful to watch in all the best ways... one character will break out into anime faces and then make a stupid silly joke. It's almost always Alphonse who does this. His eyes and face lose all detail in the middle of a touching moment, does that typical anime bs face, then he says something stupid or acts all wacky and goofy... I was hoping FMA Brotherhood would just be a more adult telling of the tail. That's what I thought it was going to be when I bought it! I didn't even know the manga was drastically different. But nope. It still has this whacky crappy anime humour stuff shoved into a beautifully written story. It ruins the moment consistently.
Not ONE serious, dramatic, emotional moment is not ruined by this comedy sketch behaviour.  Even 2 deaths suffer from a massive tone shift in the next upcoming scenes or the intro of the next episode. Which makes viewing in a marathon a worse experience since you don't have time to let the emotional weight set in. As I write this I noticed I marked the story at an 8... I am putting it down to a 6. I realize I have overrated this show at 7, it should be a 6. I will fix that.
Art:
It's okay... it's not that great tbh. There are no great set pieces, some of the animations are choppy, a lot of weird faces. They break into anime face over and over for WHHAAAACKY COMEDY omg so funny look at the character's weird face!
Only... I'm not 12, I'm not 13. I don't want weird anime emoticon faces. I wanted a more adult, improved version of 2003. But in honesty, other than the colour correction and lighting effects... this show doesn't look any better than 2003. This shows art is decent at best. It's not bad, but it's not good. It might be fair... but yeah it's nothing to write home about like some people talk about. The best scenes are in the snow.
This show is a joke art-wise compared to Mushi-Shi, Cowboy Bebop, GiTs, Macross Plus, etc.
Sound:
Some fair music. The voice acting is fair... but there's constant audio errors, weird cutting, you can hear the instruments in some people's voice acting lines and there's one that I can literally hear another person speaking faintly while the character is talking. I thought someone in the background of the scene was supposed to be talking, but nope.
It also suffers from the WORST fricken thing in anime for voicing. Characters are reading lines. They aren't talking, they aren't talking to one another. There is no conversation between the characters. People are simply reading lines and delivering them to a microphone. They might be doing a good job of it, but nothing is natural. Nothing sounds like two people talking. This gets worse when there are 5 characters in the scene and it feels like people are just waiting for their turn to speak. They start out their lines loud and without considering the emotion or the weight of characters who just previously spoke.
The best voice actors in this series are the ones who did Lust, and Roy Mustang. These two actually seem to play off of what the lines previously were... or maybe it's just how they naturally do these scripts. I suppose the Elric brother's father also does this well. But the rest are just waiting to read their lines and they never play off the emotion of what was said before. Edward is the worst, Alphone is very bad at it, Yogi etc are just insufferable because of this. Didn't anyone playback the other actors' lines to the actors? Why not record it in a round session with multiple actors like some of the best animes in existence had? I'll tell you why. Because that costs money, and FMA is a budget production no matter how much you want to shill it.
Character:
Pretty okay for the most part. The best characters are super under-utilized in this. Lust barely has any stage time and she has the most presence out of anyone in the entire show. Mustang is a well-done character, Hughes is good but they ramped him up a bit to try and... you know, oversell his arc. Bradley is one of the most pleasantly good changes in terms of character writing and acting.
In general... characters only stand out because it's ""FMA"" and people think that it's the best thing since... anything ever. Which while good, while enjoyable... it's not spectacular like, say, Princess Mononoke. Or Cowboy Bebop.Or several others.
Enjoyment:
It's still an enjoyable experience. I never found myself bored. I did cringe a bunch though. This show really wants to ramp up the ""WHaaAAAaaacCcCckYY"" anime humour. The story and emotional weight, the tone, all suffer because of this crap. I was hoping to get a good animated show to maybe show off to my dad, since he does like some shows like Bebop, we even sat down together and watched that show when I was younger. I would have liked to have a good animated show to visit him and maybe pop in and watch. Thankfully we got together every week to watch GoT, because this show is not good enough to show non-anime fans.
This would probably be one of the worst shows, aside from like Naruto, SAO, or Moe crap, to show non-anime fans. And I ALWAYS see anime die-hard weebs recommending this to people who just want to see if they could even like anime in the first place. STOP THIS. RECOMMEND BEBOP. FMA follows every friggen trope in the anime book, it's all the reason so many people avoid anime. Just with a really well-done story. Except in this show, the beginning is god awful and so many characters make no sense unless you've seen the 2003 show. Or the manga.
Overall:
Originally I planned to give this a 7. Just because I am an avid anime fan, and I love the medium and the potential for telling interesting and out their tales, but while writing this, I realized it's way closer to a 6 than it is a 7. I would give it a 6.5 if possible. It's a good show, and if you are a fan of anime... you've probably already watched it. But if you are new to anime or you don't like anime for the weird tropes like anime faces, stupid ""whacky"" comedy that breaks tense moments, and bad pacing - well then. All those problems are here, and worse than the 2003 version. If you are looking for a more grown-up and evolved Full Metal Alchemist to experience, this ain't it.
It's a shame. It had such a wonderful story to tell but squandered it for fanservice. Anywho, that's all. Interspecies Review Numba One!",6
"
                This series is one of two adaptations of a popular manga, and the second to be released.  Of the two, it is by far the more faithful to the original story, and therefore is the one I would recommend to people who want to watch one of these anime adaptations.  However, and quite disappointingly, it also has much lower production value than the first series.  Full disclosure, I watched the original adaptation first, and so I couldn't help but compare this one to it while watching it, and that unavoidably made the experience less enjoyable for me.  Compared to the smooth
                  animation and exceptional OST of the original, this adaptation felt lackluster.  Really, the only area that this adaptation outperforms the original is in faithfulness to the story, in which case I have to wonder, why not just read the manga?
But, setting that aside, let's consider the story itself.  The general premise of the world design is interesting and has massive potential... which is only partially realized, in large part due to the simplicity of the character design... more on that later.  The overall plot progression is this series's one saving grace... it's quite good, and much more interesting than the alternate story told by the original adaptation, though still leaves some room for improvement.
The character design is... a mixed bag.  On the one hand, there is a good variety of character personalities and motivations... some of which are quite interesting, though others are quite dull.  On the other hand, the alchemists' proficiencies with alchemy are quite one-dimensional, and frankly, seem rather lazy, and even strains the believability of the world design.  In a world where theoretically anything can be achieved through alchemy as long as you're willing and able to pay a corresponding price, almost every alchemist is a one trick pony, relying on a single signature transmutation as the only tool in their toolbox.  Even if we charitably assume that alchemy is incredibly difficult and complex, so that a single transmutation circle constitutes a life's work, logically, there would still be some collection and exchange of transmutation circles, with state alchemists carrying a variety to choose from in different situations, but this doesn't seem to happen at all.
In summary, this series is worth watching if you don't want to read the manga.  It has a good story, though it's held back by typical shounen-style character designs and mediocre production quality.  You could definitely do worse in choosing something to watch,  but I found the viewing experience to be predominately disappointing.",5
"
                My friend recommended this show to me, and at first i was skeptical. The pictures i saw from it made me think it was about machines or robots or something like that, and im not a fan of those types of anime. 
But i learned not to judge a book by its cover.
From the first episode, I found FMA:B amazing. It's storyline is amazing. It's characters are likeable, and it's just so deep and epic.
Let me clear up some misunderstandings people may have first of all:
FMA original and FMA:brotherhood are not sequels. FMA original follows the same storyline for the first few episodes as the
                  manga, but then the rest are not part of the manga at all. Even so, I'd say it's by far the best anime i've seen that has done that well without following the manga.
Anyway, FMA:brotherhood follows the manga, and even by just a little, I prefer FMA:B better, because it's a little less confusing.
They're both amazing though, and it doesn't really matter which you watch first, but I recommend to watch BOTH (FMA and FMA:B). 
I love its character development, its suspense and action and adventure, and it's characters. I love the storyline's depth and epicness, its funny parts and sad parts and epic parts are all amazing. You will love it by the end.",10
"
                First of all, I have not read the manga but i have seen the first full metal alchemist. I admit FMAB is a lot better than the original FMA in term of everything: the story, art, sound, characters. 
However, it is overated for me being the top anime.
I will go more into details. 
Story: It is about two brothers try to find a way to get back bodies back. They experience many things along the way and learn certain lessons. It builds up very high climax towards the end but it fails to delivery that. *Spoiler* The final villain was very disappointing...
Art: Good art. Although
                  i watched it in 2015 so there are some which made better but it is still good regardless. 
Sound: I dont have particular opinion on it. I really like the first opening song but that's it. The rest is just so so.
Character: I guess this is where most people give FMAB high rating. The development around these two boys are interesting. Wide range of characters.
Enjoyment: As being a shounen anime, it is expected some cool and epic scenes. There are not much of it. The fightings scene were rather plain and dull in my opinion. There were only 2 or 3 good fighting scenes out of the whole anime. I am also a person who expect good and epic fighting scenes so it is definitely a dissatisfied feeling for me from this.
Overall: It is definitely not a bad anime but it is not as great as the Hype suppose to be. I had too high expectation when i started it and it only left me hanging there. I do recommend it as an anime to watch if you have time but it is not a must-watch for me...",7

                Hello Everyone, just for a heads up this is gonna be a long long review so sit back and hopefully you can enjoy my review. 
First of all, WHAT CAN I SAY? It will always will be my favorite anime period. This anime lived up to its massive potential and seriously in my opinion its way more than a 10/10.. It broke the charts in my heart. It was and always will be an original masterpiece, as it going to be difficult wait nearly impossible to top right now. Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood had it all, the climax, plot, theme everything plus more. THE STORY
                  was truly one of a kind and unpredictable as it prob put everyone including me on the edge of our seats.You couldn't even tell what was going to happen most of the time. The characters was well executed in their own unique way and they were effectively used to their potential. From Episode 1 it was already all out and stayed like that until episode 64 plus there was no waste of episodes as the story was always hyping whats ahead to their maximum ability. . The emotions that filled out in this anime was incredible. At first glance I honestly thought it was just all hype but it proved me wrong by a mega landslide. The characters especially the main protagonist Edward Elric who is now my favourite had determination, drive, and pure passion to overcome just about anything got me all pumped up. If this is anime taught me something it's pretty much everything that I lacked. I can finally wake up properly and say to myself ""Damn, if a anime character like that has all of those traits to keep on living no matter how intense the pain is, then why am i here complaining at my life or why dont i have any wifi? Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood isn't one of the top best Animes of the Century just because of the sound, story, enjoyment, art, and characters , as in my opinion it gave us a reason to not give up. Its probably saying to much just because its not even real and an anime right? The bigger picture is that IT SHOWED US WHAT IS LIKE to lose a friend, comrade, lover, a body part, and how they fought through it. It felt that it is a real story and that we can't just give in now. That is how much IMPACT this anime has given to me, and it even made me shed a tear in the finale. To fight all of that and still show the drive and determination just surprised me. I learned a lot like legit and ill always give my all until the day i die. This is just my heavy opinion and i hope you guys can respect that.
I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE, even if you don't watch anime JUST WATCH THIS AND ULL BE LOVING WHAT ANIME IS ALL ABOUT. I watched the original one first to hype me up for brotherhood and so i can understand it more clear but you don't have to watch it as heading into Brotherhood is also fine. I'd like thank everyone in advance in taking the time to read this, I really have the urge to write way more but i cant put some of my feelings to Full Metal into words and plus it might be a pain.Sorry if i poured  my heart out too much but really it was and is always going to be that damn good. LOL That Is Folks! Finally Thanks Yasuhiro Irie for directing, Hiroo Maruyama, Noritomo Yonai, Ryo Oyama, Nobuyuki Kurashige for producing and pretty much everyone who participated in making this! OH AND THE MUSIC IS AMAZING TOO DOWNLOAD IT PEEPS, Peace Out",10

                I started watching this serie a while ago and it really has one of the best storyline's of anime's ive ever seen. The whole time ur watching you keep being enjoyed, enjoyed and enjoyed. Also Thrilled to watch the next episode over and over. This serie is an absolute masterpiece which i definitely give an overall score of a 10. The story is outsandingly good. The art is not the best of the best but just really good. Sound is also really good But there are anime's which have just a slightly better sound so thats the reason why i give it a great 9.
                  The characters are really really good but not my favorites so ill give that a great 9 to. The enjoyment of this serie is really high. I watched it in the bus to my school trip, i watched it on my laptop at home, I just watched it everytime i could because i couldnt stop loving this serie over and over. Overall its not my favourite or best anime but its definitely worth watching and a big 10!",10
"
                Honestly, I only watched this at first because it was the highest rated. I thought to myself, why not just see the best since I wanna watch some anime?
And knowing myself, I'm pretty new to anime. I've only seen the big name anime, so in no way is my opinion biased. I've never seen or heard much about this anime besides that it is ""the best"" according to many.
Naturally, I came into this anime expecting something great, and it didn't fail to deliver in the slightest. At first, I was worried that this anime was a little too long for me to finish, and that
                  I would get bored and drop it halfway. However, as I went deeper and deeper into the series, the thought of dropping completely left my head.
I think what really makes this anime shine is the characters. You really grow to care for them, and you get to learn all of their quirks. I personally found the jokes that the writer took to put in there hilarious- for instance, every time someone called Ed short he would turn into a live landmine- that was great. I especially liked it when the people he was fighting would point out his height. It just made everything so lighthearted, and often times I feel anime can be overly serious, to the point that you can't watch too many episodes in a day because otherwise you'll feel overloaded. FMAB did a great job of balancing serious episodes with lighthearted ones.
In addition, the moments when the animator purposefully drew Ed or Al in weird ways to convey emotion, for instance when they were embarrassed Al would be drawn with 2 dots for eyes and a gray frame, making him look meek. Its just these little details that make it so much more enjoyable.
And of course, since you grow to like these characters so much, it adds extra oomph to the plot, when one dies or when another feels joy. There is also so much variety. You have the hotheaded, impulsive Ed. You have the jealous, and yet caring Alphonse. You also have the calm Roy Mustang, and his faithful companion Hawkeye. And of course, you have all the homunculi, of which I thought Greed was the most interesting. There are so many characters, I would really doubt that a viewer couldn't resonate with at least one, if not more.
All in all I highly recommend this anime to someone who is looking for something to commit to. It is long, but those hours fly by when you are watching some quality work, from one of the best anime that the genre has to offer. And previously if you told me this anime was the best, I would doubt that any anime could be better than the first anime I ever saw (One punch man). But now, I believe that this anime may just be good competition. It definitely deserves the 10 in my book. 
And I'd just like to point out that Roy Mustang says ""Hagane no Renkinjutsu"" the best :P
Thanks for reading!!!",10

Review In short, Let me keep it real. This anime isn't worth your time there you go.
I have Dropped this series for many reasons alone that I did to where I was watching at and its pretty simple why that is and why It makes sense for me to review full metal alhemist desu ga. Firstly I base this series on the analogy of 2 words that continues to irk at my own viewing experience of watching this for a long while now.
Those 2 words would be Annoying Tendency!
Not only just that, This anime has dragged onto the point where I know longer care where
                  this story is heading because unfortunately its writer, likes to Time waste way too often.
And now the fans have overate this to the point where literally the story has not changed or mature with its premise as its still follows the same freaking formula of repetitive shonen nonsense of its character troupes with most episodes from 1 to god knows what episode its currently on right now and with the exception of thinking that this is a pirate adventure which is totally dumb as hell and has lost credibility in claiming that this is about pirates.
Just like the Naruto series lost credibility thinking its own series projects ninjas in its own show and just as similar as that is to full metal alhemist desu ga its those flaws that just keeps continuing on and on.
its like the equivalent of that bad TV series Lost but on crack with many bad implants to its female characters which I mean Lots.
Reading its Guinness book of its trash manga doesn't even help or even give me value for reading through it as it has loads of the same reasons of problems as I've mentioned above.
If that wasn't enough of an issue. Its story of its characters and its events always end up being a very similar Forced Melodramatic story writing that you have seen and heard loads of times which in turn only forces you to endure this along with bad side stories that contribute into an even slower pace for this show in its build up with each Arc  of episodes later by then it becomes unacceptable!
From each arc to arc for me did not guarantee any love or charm what so ever to lots of its characters like the time you are first introduce to them in the series upon viewing.
Instead it only just copies and paste stuff mostly of the same scenarios that you would see far too often in this series for most of these characters along with their progression except for some few that show to get more abilities than others really makes it fair in its togetherness doesn't it?
Some bonding that is if there are only certain characters that can do certain things most others couldn't do even when uniting the strawhats together it only makes it for a more cheesy affair than ever most of the time when you would obviously expect it, Especially when it comes off as cliche as it does.
Which also regards to parts where full metal alhemist desu ga wants to go dark and its so desperate to up the ante but only to result into a similar conclusion like before.
I mean come on its way past most of the amount of standard shonen episodes! which reminds me of Detective Conan, However in Conan's case the Difference is between these 2 series is in its Fandoms. full metal alhemist desu ga fans try to Overhype the crap out of this which is really unnecessary even when lots of people know clearly that it is the case.
We already got the basic gist of things of this series from the beginning, Even through its world setting up and till now is still not even well structured since it throws random places for us to be distracted so that fillers can help maintain its bad pace let alone does it even make that much sense to begin with especially when trying to use foreshadowing to justify the ridiculous amount of episodes that is in this series as it is to make us feel like we have feel invested in the unknown mysteries of the show which actually does the opposite effect.
I believe the full metal alhemist desu ga fandom have gotten mixed up with what world building actually is with the amount of episodes there have been especially focusing on stuff that this show thinks I should see but I don't and no I don't need to have to skip arcs just to enjoy something, Why should I? that is just retarded. Is that why its Manga counterpart is in the Guinness book of records because of its pacing and complacency? Makes sense for whatever parts of this series gains popularity in much of its story for being pointlessly repetitive i suppose.
1. First off regarding what I've mentioned so far,
If you have an immersive world and there is already enough content in the story/journey in your world building never mind how vast or mysterious it is, Don't pointlessly drag it out instead USE IT! and stop milking it with stupid character expressions of coincidences full of plot devices and plot armour, I do not care that it is a dumb shonen. At least FMA knew this a lot better.
2. Pointless prologues to your episodes.
3. Bad morals in many different situations of the story with its writing.
4. Stupid journey objectives that hardly revolves around the plot of the treasure of full metal alhemist desu ga until twelve of episodes later on to the point which is unacceptable along with milking its main characters most of the time of this franchise that gets to the point where it feels like its turning into filler which by the way there are a lot of them no matter what fans try to say against this.
5. Stop foreshadowing something in the story that was mentioned  its not good story telling neither is it clever in any way since it never justifies its consitency for constantly dragging on in the way it does.
6. Over hyping stronger characters that don't really get involve in the story that much anyway.
7. Most of the times bad animation no doubt
8. its voice acting well its just mostly tedious and over the place nothing great or over the top despite how he writes the story (Bad writing Btw) that even after listening to lot of these characters it just makes me want to listen to a dying mule instead. Nothing weird or wonderful about that my friends.
With all that being said, Its only qualities that I like about full metal alhemist desu ga are the art designs of certain characters and the fact there is a series that stars pirates, since there are very few anime series that have pirates (not that they are suppose to be role models in any way)
but those are the only positives with this series in general for me and honestly nothing more.
Overall its an over exaggerated series of repetitive outcomes that I have not enjoyed in its long run about dumb wannabe pirates quote PIRATES! It's only real positive here is HEY ITS ABOUT SWAG WOW THATS RARE TO FIND IN ANIME ISN'T IT???..WRONG BECAUSE CONSIDERING WHAT good ARE LIKE IN REAL LIFE WHO CARES ANYWAYS. Thats like me wanting to write a story about slavery on different Ethnicity/Races but NOOOO.. that won't be right so why not glorify slave traders into being these nice dumb heroes because you know? It's fiction and it sounds interesting right? RIGHT??... AGAIN WRONG.
Now going back to my point of Watching this crappy cartoon this only makes me or most viewers seem to have to glorify such a pathetic outlook of a premise with its stretched out world building that is not even incisive enough to its history of the story, neither is it memorable for me enough to even care about it to watch it any longer as it doesn't reward me growth in their characters, a decisive objective or consistency of its so called journey within its story in general.
Last but not least The Comedy really suck! seriously do yourselves a Big favour there are better Shonens and many other Animes out there that is worth watching that has better characters, better story, better pace and better growth than this long turd of a show that seems to overate a lot in Japan above others which unfortunately is the world we live in tHey. Consider this dropped and good riddance.
Excuse me for being honestly critical as I am, I do not sugar coat a series if thats what you really wanted about this show in general, well too bad. You can go to other reviewers that are giving a ten towards this Overrated piece of fiction that's overstayed it's welcome.
To all of you who have read my review thanks for taking the time and take care.
FMA still superior than these one",1

                I don't think this anime is as good as the ratings. in my opinion, this anime story is 'ordinary'. It's a good story line, and it's a bit complicated, but I don't like anime with lots of characters in it. because it makes me confused to understand the story. the story in this anime is not only serious, there are comedy scenes in it so that add this story to be interesting. and what I like, the graphics in this anime are good, although it was released in 2009, this anime is still worth watching in 2020, and the graphics are not age-consuming. one more
                  thing that I like, the effect of alchemy stance every user is very good. and when compared to the naruto shippuden anime (which in my opinion is almost similar), it is still better naruto shippuden than FMA: B, both from the storyline, characters, and stance. but in terms of graphics, FMA:B is still better than Naruto Shippuden. indeed everyone's assessment is different, and anime that has a high rating is not necessarily preferred by some people. and one more thing, the first episode until the 40s episode was very boring. too many characters are displayed, too many story lines, and the plot is less exciting. indeed each battle scene is quite exciting, but there are some battle scenes that are easy to guess.
in my opinion, episode 50+ is more interesting than the previous episode. where episode 50+ features the war between Central and Briggs, as well as the battle of all the troops against the villain 'homunculus father'. but as I said before, the battle scenes are easy to guess.
Well, I really don't like this anime even though the rating is high. reasonable, because everyone's tastes are different. Also, I feel that this anime doesn't live up to the expectations I wanted. I think this anime will be very, very good and interesting, also fun, considering the anime's rating is number 1. It is not. in my opinion, this anime is 'just ordinary'. there is nothing special that shows this anime number one. there may be 1, the graphics. 
Well, the point is I don't like FMAB. placing it at number 1 is a bit over the top and didn't meet my expectations when I watched it.",3
"
                I should've hopped on this train years ago if I knew i'd love it this much. 
Tl,dr; It's a show praised and glorified by Anime fans across the world, and it's safe to say that it lives up to its name. It's a well-written show that accompanies the journey the brothers take to recover their bodies, ultimately finding pieces of themselves and more along the way. You'll find most genres fit here, but Shouen comes to mind at its core. Very open minded show, and it's my belief that anyone can take something from it. 
It gets a lot of hassle being a manga adaptation
                  and all, but does a great job with it. As far as some go, there's definitely good merit to why this is #1 on MAL. Between the story, art, and characters, everything was all quite impressive, and every detail was presented in a way that felt refreshing to experience. There's a lot of love in creating this one, and you surely can tell. 
Never read the manga, so I believe my perspective is tailored for any reader. Pacing is always brilliantly timed to string you where they want you to be. FMAB is a master of weaving in plot twists and loose ends. It's also got a knack of tossing in crazy developments and ideas to make sure things stay interesting. It's good risk taking that pays off down the line, as these developments link together to deliver a phenomenal execution of an end. If you're smart enough to understand the tropes, I'm sure you can get a general outline of where the story is heading, and yet... it still retains that charming element.
The voice acting is remarkable. High performing actors across the board in both dub and sub. Soundtrack has range being catchy at times and really soothing at others. Openings and endings are actually worth a listen, which I can't say stands true for all anime. Can be a bit annoying since it replays the same tracks a bit earlier on, but that problem dissolves as the show progresses. 
Wasn't necessarily my cup of tea, but it's still spectacular in it's own right. Very consistent and does the job well, that much is clear. It takes a huge spike in improvement around mid-episodes due to an increase in budget. Facial expressions, backgrounds, and designs work well and mesh together. There are no fluffy and useless drawings- animation is purposeful. 
FMAB features an iconic cast of characters you won't forget that easily. If you're going to reminisce anything about this show, it's the characters that will tug at your heart the most. Each one with a story to tell, a lesson to teach, and a personality to love. It's impossible to not get attached to even some of the minor characters they present- as the Anime really does give you a reason to care. Dimensions aren't restricted either, FMBA isn't a stranger to the same faces, and they make an effort to pry into the worlds of different people- including the Xing and Ishvalan races. The only issue I can see is motive and backbone for some minor characters, as they aren't fully explored in depth. Personally would've loved to see Mustang a bit more. 
The best case scenario in any Anime is that you fall in love with the show. It changes you and marks you in some way, and you can find something valuable to recall down the line. I'll vouch that FMBA is indeed a worthy show possible of all this. It takes you on what seems to be a straightforward journey and hits you with everything that Anime possibly can. The show takes a plethora of themes and weaves them into the show beautifully- from sacrifice, courage, bonds, integrity, race, ideology, justice, the human condition, and ultimately life, to make this ""best case scenario"" a reality. You'll be sure to pick out plenty of fond memories and learn something down the line.
I definitely enjoyed the watch as the overall production of the Anime is quite extraordinary. The search for truth, the pursuit to restore their bodies, the core of alchemy, and so on. Goes without saying, it all links together for one helluva show. El and Al really stick it to you: it's not about the destination, but the journey. That's the best part about this Anime.",9

                I once used to be an anti-weeb. I thought those who watched anime and read manga were weird, geeky, puerile. Why? I thought anime was a bunch of cartoon girls with really big eyes with lots of animated punctuation marks and Japanese. I was mature, normal, and did not watch that kind of stuff.
This was the first anime I watched. Why? I thought that if I were to see only one anime series, I would see the best, so I looked at multiple websites and videos and determined that FMAB was the best. And of the ones I've seen so far to completion, it is
                  the best. Not necessarily my favorite, but the best.
It was so good that I wanted more, which is why I still watch anime today. But let me explain why this anime is so majestic, why I get a certain ineffable feeling of awe when listening to the soundtrack or seeing the OP/ED videos again.
STORY. You can read the summary. Sounds interesting, right? Then watch it. 64 episodes, zero filler, of one connected flawless story revolving around the equivalence of alchemy and its consequences. A masterful paradigm of the first type of anime plot, that is, protagonist vs. antagonist. Equally grim and bright at times, the story soars along towards the ending which is one of the best endings in anime I've seen so far.
ART. Bones may not be my favorite studio, but it certainly evokes the flavor of the story. From the way Edward's eyes expand when he encounters something horrific to the way the brothers turn into jelly next to their teacher to the fire and cadavers and occult gore associated with the evil in this story, the art is done masterfully. Perfect depiction.
SOUND. Akira Senju's style harks back to classical, with substantial use of the deeper strings and percussion. The entire soundtrack can be seen as one grand symphony, with Senju as its composer and conductor. May be a bit repetitive at times, but hey, similar themes reappear, similar types of events, and with 64 episodes one would be hard-pressed to compose unique tunes for every single event that necessitates music. He definitely has a distinctive tone and mark to his music -- you can tell immediately when listening to various anime soundtracks when FMAB OST comes up.
CHARACTER. Edward Elric, the protagonist, is one of my favorite characters of anime. In the entire cast for FMAB, the fact that I like him the best just comes to show how awesome of a main character he is. His determination to do good against overwhelming evil and fight for what he believes in is a high standard. But besides Edward, the supporting cast is just magnificent. The loyal brother Alphonse Elric, the stoic King Bradley, the caring Winry Rockbell, the strong yet gentle Alex Louis Armstrong, and many, many others. In fact, the quality of the English dub for this anime (which I saw) just comes to show how good of an anime this is, to merit so many aptly chosen voice actors. And of course, there's plenty of fighting, which is something I look for in anime and probably what you, dear reader, do too (if you've read this far).
ENJOYMENT. What can I say? I stayed up late every night to finish this in a week. It's that good. This is one of those anime that when watching it you know, you just feel it, that it is of superb quality.
This anime is certainly not childish, weird, or immature. It is quite mature. If you're already a ""weeb,"" then you probably watched this, if not, then I can't understand why you haven't. If you're wading into the wonderful waters of anime for the first time, then be my guest and watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
One word to describe this anime: awesome",10
"
                I'll update my review when I finish, cuz for now I've seen only 13 eps.
Why is it masterpiece? I don't want to sound harsh, but there's a lot of space for improvement. I see a lot of people claiming it gets better later, but in my opinion, 13 episodes should be enough to get you interested. 
I can't deny first three did a good job at introducing the setting, but... for me, they were the best out of 13. And that's discouraging.
For now, I'm watching it with ""oh, so this is the moment they want me to cry on,  moment they want me to
                  laugh, and ooOO SERIOUS DEEP DIALOGUE/MONOLOGUE"", but the truth is, I don't feel it. Yes, it's bad character x died, but I barely knew him. Yes, these words are serious and have something behind them, but I can hardly reflect on them because COMEDIC MOMENT appears, ruining both dark atmosphere and my enjoyment. I can't laugh at something when it ruins a serious scene.
And no, I don't really care about art and soundtrack in this one. Maybe they helped me enjoy Violet Evergarden, but in FMAB they just are, doing what they should, but without bigger impression on me.",6
"
                I'm not really a fan of the shounen genre but FMAB is an exception. It pulled me right in...the story, the characters, music, everything was perfect. I don't remember watching any anime where I liked ALL the characters! The plot is original and it gets really interesting with each episode. There are no filler episodes...every episode is important to the plot. 
Mind you, I have also seen the original FMA (2003) but It sucked after the first half. Although, it was more dark and emotional than FMAB, I still think FMAB is better! FMAB did more justice to the characters and plot than the original.
                  I don't remember liking any characters except Edward and Hughes. Honestly, It was quite forgettable, well, except for the main theme music. 
As for the flaws, the first few episodes are fast-paced but only people who have seen the original version will notice this. Another issue people can have with FMAB is its humor which seems out of place in some scenes. 
I'm not saying its the best anime ever cuz it has its flaws. A lot of fans of previous adaptation don't give it a chance and recommend others not to watch it. Don't listen to them and go watch this anime. Even if you don't like shounen (like me), you will definitely like it if you watch it with open mind n without prejudice. I promise you won't regret it!",10
"
                I honestly wish MAL had a way of doing the ratings so I could do points (like 9.8) than a whole number (like 10) so I could give a more accurate rating.. but. 
before my review, I wanted to mention that my review is catered towards those who have watched the original series since every time I think of Brotherhood, I'm constantly linking it back to the original series.  
anyways. 
I think it's a sin if you have not heard of the FMA franchise and you watch animes. 
The original FMA series swept the anime world by storm and collected fans like a hook,
                  line and sinker. While its popularity dawdled when the series started breaking away from the manga's storyline, it was still hailed by many reviewers/critics alike as a great, must-watch series.  I was no exception to its hype. 
After watching the original FMA, I stayed away from animes for the last three years. Any series I tried after FMA, I couldn't get into it -- it just wasn't good enough. It didn't have that ""it"" factor that FMA had. And so I left each series after FMA unfinished, dropped and with huge disappointments. So I left the anime world all together until I heard the news of a remake of FMA coming out. Initially when I heard about this re-make series, I got nervous at the possibility of them ruining what I hailed as one of the greatest animes at the time. After all, was it possible to perfect an already masterful series? But for the sake of my love for the original series, I decided to give Brotherhood a try. 
And what a terrifyingly amazing anime it was... 
...is what I would like to say. but the first impression of FMA: brotherhood was disappointment. I mostly owe this to the extreme fast pacing that FMA: Brotherhood adapted for the first 11 episodes. It starts off at a breakneck speed and crams I believe 2-3 episodes of what the original FMA had into 1.
The advantage of this is that it is a nice, FAST refresher for those who have watched the original series and for those who are new, it is a very fast summary of the big events (ie nina) that would continue to resurface throughout the series. The disadvantage (and my problem) of this method is that it loses the emotions behind each scenes (namely Nina's) that the original series so very well poignantly portrayed. However, I do understand that Bones had to cram this long series into a span of a year. Taking that into account, it does get the job done and bring the audiences to the branching point where FMA and brotherhood essentially splits, neatly and cleanly. And from this point onwards, it certainly did become the ""terrifyingly amazing anime"" that I hoped it to be. 
The plot is undoubtedly one of the most original, action-packed, twisted storylines I have seen. However, what makes this anime so great is that it also had comedic moments that serve as a breather to all the emotional or intense scenes. Most animes I've seen run into a problem here as they are either not able to break away from the heavy atmosphere or the comedic moments are awkwardly placed. Brotherhood proves otherwise and makes the switch into and out of comedic scenes work smoothly. And I praise them for it. Even in the most dire consequences, I can't help but let out a chuckle every time Ed erupts into fits with the word ""short"" The plot is definitely more smoother than FMA was (most likely since it just followed the manga, which had a very complex yet easy to follow storyline) and the ending of Brotherhood is simply divine. I can't put it in words how good and satisfied the ending left me -- it neatly put all the stray hairs into one and gave me what I think is the most appropriate and ""realistic"" end for this series.  
If I had one thing to complain about aside from the loss of emotional component in the beginning, it's the episode with Yoki. Honestly, it was so short that it completely passed over my head when he was reintroduced. I thought he was a character that appeared out of nowhere until the anime had a refresher of where the viewers first met him. While he isn't a super important character, he's a character that constantly appears and reappears throughout the series. Thus, I felt that his episode should have been expanded longer than what it was in the beginning. 
I'm not a huge stickler on music/voice in general -- but the voice actors did a great job with each of their assigned characters. I can't imagine them sounding like any other after the completion of the series. And the soundtracks, while I do prefer the FMA ones, Brotherhood still provides great OSTs that left me with no complaints.  
From what I remember, while it was more simple, the animation was more crisper than what I had seen in the FMA. however, I did originally hate the art -- not because it was bad but it took me a couple episodes to get used to it. After all, I loved FMA through and through that I've rewatched the series on more than one occassion. It was natural that the image of Ed, Al and all the other characters were so deeply embedded in my head that my brain registered any other form of them as ""weird"" and ""awkward"" but after getting used to it, I really liked it. I remember really enjoying the fight scenes in FMA brotherhood, lots of great visual affects, pleasing to the eye. (especially during transmutation) fantastic.  
If I had to point to the single most thing that probably made Brotherhood a bigger gem than FMA it is probably in the characters. FMA, I think, focuses heavily on the two brothers and their development throughout the story. Brotherhood doesn't stray from this but also adds in the other characters and enhances their role in the story -- adding depth and complexity to the side characters more than FMA did such as with Mustang and most definitely the antagonists. (I find this ironic since Brotherhood is well, called ""brother""hood but does a better job in developing the entire cast) By the end of the story, it is able to boast a gigantic number of characters but is able to package them individually into well-rounded characters. 
so the short version/my breakdown: 
plot (9.8/10) fast fast pacing in the beginning, you get used to it as it goes. however, as a compensation, lacks a bit in emotions in the beginning. well balanced series of comedy/serious moments, nice twists and an EPIC, godly ending. 
music (10/10) 
animation (10/10) took awhile to get used to. a bit more simpler than FMA but more crisp. great visual effects that stands out in the fight scenes. 
character (10/10) a crazy huge cast. however, they're all well-developed and fit into the story rather nicely. 
enjoyment (10++++/10) .. if i could give 11s, this would be it.
overall (10/10) I'm hesitant to give 10s in any form -- but I think this anime truly deserves it. (or if not, it would be like a 9.99999999) It exceeded what I thought was impossible and delivered a captivating story with detailed character development, great music/visual to boot and NO FILLERS (the last one being a pretty amazing feat in this day and age if you know what I mean). A classic in my book, and a must-watch in everyone's. 
*random note: I'm not sure how helpful this would be since most people who read this review had probably finished the series, BUT for those who are starting and have watched and loved the original series, I would actually recommend skipping the first 11 (assuming you're well familiar with the story) since I think it's around episode 11-12 where the branching from FMA and Brotherhood starts. I did that when I watched Brotherhood first time around because I've watched FMA enough times (I'm too embarrassed to tell you the exact number) that I just continued comparing the two series and also got bored since I knew the scenes by heart.",10
"
                There's only one word to describe this anime: PERFECT. The reasons that I say that are as below:
Story:
For someone who watched the 2003 version,I would say that nothing could beat the storyline of the 2003 version but I was dead wrong. This version follows the manga which in my opinion is what most anime should be like. I am not saying that all adaptions from manga must strictly follow all the details in the manga but this version of Fullmetal Alchemist is exactly how you would imagined it to be like when you read the manga or even better. It is a perfect story coming
                  to life and it will blow you away. It goes by phases which built up the suspense and takes your breathe away each time due to the scale and magnitude of the events. As the story progresses, you will be filled with more questions and you will keep thinking that it couldn't get better but it will,I assure you and that's the main attraction factor, the plot that draws you in,with you wanting to know more and more. The plot twists are placed so well that it's not even plot twists anymore,it's like flowing water which just integrates into your mind and at the end of the story, all your questions are answered, with you taking a different look at life. 
Art:
Well,I am no artist and I am not very picky about graphics but I can definitely say that the graphics for this anime is really nice. The flashes and booms are very detailed and yet,it gives you a simple feeling and gets the point across very easily,unlike those complicated graphics and animations that gives you the feeling of what the hell just happened.
Sound:
From explosions to water dripping to even bird chirping,it is really quite detailed.  The music really fits the scenes and added an extra layer of enjoyment to the anime. The opening song is also very good,especially opening 4 which is 'Period' by Chemistry.
Character:
The development of the characters are very through and they come together perfectly just like jigsaw pieces,giving a great sense of enjoyment. The feelings of the characters are reflected so well that it's no longer just an anime,you will feel that it's real life and in a real situation.
Enjoyment & Overall:
I put these two together as my answer to both of them are the same. I enjoyed the series a lot and the reasons are what I have stated above and overall,this anime truly deserves credit as it integrates into the mind so well and viewers are sucked into their world and it appeals to all the senses except taste of course. Last but not least,it made me understand the different aspects of life and the true value of life which I think is very meaningful and is done in a very subtle way but yet,it etches in my mind. I hope for those who hasn't watched this anime,after looking at my review,you would go watch it and experience true perfection as I have experienced.",10

                this is my third review again apologies if i make any mistakes after watching the original Fullmetal Alchemist series i was interested in seeing how they were going to top the original series with the remake and even though i wasn't disappointed with Brotherhood there are some parts of the original that i liked more than Brotherhood the original is much more darker deeper and has much more suspense though brotherhood has it's dark moments as well i did like how almost every character gets the spotlight and have their own ambitions and goals i was a bit disappointed with some of the characters here
                  especially Lust one of my favorite characters was reduced to a minor role while she had a larger and better role in the original despite that she's much darker in this i really liked her character i also enjoyed seeing the characters that weren't seen in the original May Lin Armstrong's Sister And Father who was a interesting villain the fight scenes are a lot better on here than the 2003 series 
 Story  if you seen the original you know how it goes the two brothers Edward And Alphonse Elric perform a transmutation that costs them dearly Edward loses his limbs and Al loses his entire body and has his soul transferred to a suit of armor the two brothers go on a long and enduring journey to get their bodies back.and search for the philosopher's stone the plot is really amazing lots of conspiracies and suspense and there's just so much going on and it's just great 8/10 
Sound most of the cast from the original series reprise their roles excellent voice acting probably one of the best well done English Dubbed anime series I've seen so far and the Score is really great just love the build up and the anticipation from the music it and it fits the scene whether it's a fight scene dark funny sad it just fits the opening and ending songs are cool though inferior compared to the opening ending music of the original series 9/10 
Art love the visuals here especially during the alchemy fights just fun to watch and gets better each episode 10/10 
Characters most of the characters are well developed and almost all of them have their big moments and have something that drives them and motivates them 9/10 
Overall Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is definitely worth your time it's one of the best anime series from start to finish its amazingly well done 8/10",8
"
                My opinion: 
First of all, FMA Brotherhood was no doubt one of the best animes I have ever watched. The story starts off quickly and every episode is easy to understand and, at the same time, is very interesting. Many episodes ends with cliffhangers making you want to watch more!
Plot: 
The plot of the anime was given a 10/10 because the ideas presented in this anime was very interesting. Every new problem the Elric Brothers encounter contributes to the main issue and in the end, everything adds up! Every episode of this anime is addicting (even the beginning) and it will keep making you want
                  to watch more! The main plot in the story was also very good and another reason to enjoy the anime!
Art:
I was very fascinated with the art in this anime. The animations of the battle scenes and transmutations were over the top. Unlike the original FMA, FMA brotherhood had unique animation (especially during the transmutations) that made the anime a lot more fun to watch! The opening and ending animations were also very amazing. Those animations made me want to keep watching because it previewed amazing battle scenes, without giving any spoilers.
Sound (OSTs, OP and END, Seiyuus, sound Effects, Etc):
There are many OST soundtrack and songs in FMA brotherhood and each of them were played at perfect moments! This helped build suspense and made the animation a LOT more exciting! I loved almost all of the opening and ending songs and the lyrics followed along with the plot so well! I also thought the voice actors matched each character's voice very well and made each character unique. Many of the sound effects used in battles made it a lot more exciting to watch.
Character:
I loved all the characters in FMA (including the antagonists)! Each character played a special role that contributed to the story and I had something to like about every character! In FMA brotherhood, there isn't a character that makes you like ""Man! I hate this character so much!"" Instead it made me think ""I wonder why he/she is doing this."" Sure, there are some characters I liked more than others, but all the characters played a great and interesting role and the anime wouldn't be as good if anyone of the characters were not in this anime.
Enjoyment:
This was my #1 most enjoyed anime because this anime has the ability to make you have 20 different emotions in a matter of 20-25 minutes. One episode your maybe crying and 10 minutes later on the same episode, you maybe crazily laughing! This anime had me hooked all the way through watching it. The anime had action, humor, drama, mystery, and even some romance (Royai). Though there was only a little bit of romance, it had me happily squealing over how great of a couple they were! Every little thing you learn in this anime will surprise you and you are almost guaranteed to enjoy this anime!",10
"
                Seriously, I just finished this anime like 1:00 am and gosh. I told myself that I should finish it tomorrow after waking up but damn, I couldn't because the plot is pulling me. THE PLOT!
I'm going to make this short because I also don't like reading long reviews.
This is my first review because this anime is too awesome that I really want to make a review!
Basically this is anime is AWESOME. And it actually really is to be ranked ""first"" in this site.
The plot really pulls you. The emotions just stirred up my feelings. I can't believe that I really marathon this because I usually
                  stop myself but this anime, meh, I don't give a ****. THIS IS TOO AWESOME AND JUST WATCH IT. 
Also, this changes my view to things. 
Thank you and just watch it! I guarantee that you'll love this",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an amazing anime that deserves the praises that it is associated with. One of the main reasons to why I've rated this anime as a 10 is due to its realistic preferences. this is shown symbolically as ""alchemy"". Alchemy is made out to be the first law of thermodynamics in a less abstract form (how energy cannot be created nor destroyed). Then by merging the religious aspect that we see in real life, it not for a clash of ideals like what see in our society but an almost perfect utopia for religion and science coexisting with each other

                If you enjoyed the original Fullmetal Alchemist than be prepared Brotherhood is 100 times better. And I'm not exaggerating when i say Hiromu Arakawa is the JK  Rowling of the anime industry. The show isn't just strong in story wise but it is strong in all aspects. It is a full package and deserves all the praise and in this case ratings. Now on to the review:
Story (10/10):
The story of Fullmetal Alchemist is just amazing. It keeps you rooted to your seat till the last second. The first couple of episodes are similar to the original but then it starts to follow the manga.
                  Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood explores the adventures of the Elric Brothers and how they unravel the big secret of Amestris lurking in the darkness. There are many moments that break your heart and many that will make you want to rip your hair out. It has such a good story telling and explains everything that is happening. And the fight scenes are well choreographed. The fight scenes aren't your typical Shounen fight scenes. There isn't any unnecessary talking during the fight and some scenes just stay with you forever! Of course the best part of the show is the ending! The ending is just beautiful and ties everything up nicely. There is no loose ends and leaves you satisfied but you still want more. Honestly I'm still waiting for an OVA. Overall the story of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is excellently written.
Art (10/10):
Some people say the art work of the show isn't special or unique. But i disagree only because of the fight scenes i mentioned earlier. When you watch the fight scenes it leaves you in awe. The scenes in Resembool, Ed and Al's hometown are beautiful. The art style is crisp, perfect and has great details. 
Sound (9/10):
Boy does this show has the best opening in any show ever!!! The show has five opening and five endings and out of the five openings I absolutely love four of them. Again by Yui really gets you into the zone and prepares you what to expect from the show itself and Period by Chemistry is a great opening for the climax. The ost's are really good and some are memorable but the only downside is some are repetitive and sometimes you might get bored.
Character (10/10):
 What makes the show amazing is the characters. If the characters aren't amazing then there's no point of a good story and this show has the best ensemble cast yet. The protagonist Ed is an ideal hero. He has some quirks mostly to do with his height but has a big heart. Originally the Elric Brothers, Ed and Al set out to find the philosophers stone but got tangled in a huge plot which can potentially kill everyone. And here our heroes want to do everything they can with help of their friends to save their country. The good part of this show is every character is memorable in their own way. The characters, Roy, Riza, Armstrong, Winry and Izumi from the original are back along with new characters Ling, Mai and Olivier Armstrong who bring originality to the show. The homunculi do an amazing job as villains. And some do surprise you when their identities are revealed. Of course a strong point of the characters is their voice actors. Whether you watch it in Japanese or English the actors do an incredible job and brings justice to their characters.
Overall watch this show. This is a must watch for all anime fans or people who are trying to get into anime. There is never a dull moment and it is worth your time. I would keep a tissue just in case. A superb masterpiece.",10

                Considering there is no such thing as perfect form of art. SAO .. i mean FMA brotherhood is my favourite anime of all time. I could go on writing a book about how much the series means to me but since im not getting paid , ill have to write a few words out my book. 
Everything about this anime is what defines a action adventure anime with a storyline that makes us experience the life how two brothers actions leads to something they have to find an answer to. It simply is shounen at its best. Most fans of the genre can argue on
                  their taste and others but like the great gordon ramsay says you can fuck off on that fairy tail shit. When it comes to FMA most fans in general agree that the series is one of the best out there. The soundtrack is like a blessing to our ears. The characters are not comes and goes but stays with your 1GB memory. The art is good and overall is just a must watch for anime fans. The anime at its climax is one of the best things I have ever seen and you will never forget the last words from the anime. 
Its status that lives on has gained respect for years for which we know know as a classic that lives among other names which I am not telling you.",10
"
                The series so far is going very well, and if you've seen the first anime series, you'll immediately notices the changes. The first one was amazingly good and i feel that the second will be even better, i find that it a little funnier than the first one and its quite enjoyable. any who, I'm interested in seeing how this is going to turn out compared to the other one.

                Summary: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMAB) takes place in a world where alchemy is real and everyone seems to be seeking immortality. When brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric try to use alchemy to bring back their mother who suddenly passed away, everything goes wrong. Ed loses his right arm and left leg. Al loses his entire body. The story then follows the two on a quest to get their bodies back while also trying to save their nation from turmoil. 
Story: 10/10 The story line for FMAB is phenominal in my opinion. I have never watched the original series but this series closely follows the manga
                  unlike it's predecessor. As a person who often falls asleep when watching TV, even with shows I'm interested in, this one kept me awake and completely enthralled. I never felt bored during an episode. Each one is important for the overall plot. Quite oftten I find beginnings of anime to be hard to get into and they start off slow. FMAB was not like that. I was hooked right away after one episode. The way the story is told makes you want to find out what's going to happen next. It's hard for me to properly say exactly how the story is amazing, it just it. 
Art/Animation: 9/10 Overall the animation is also spot on. It can be simple yet also have major detail where it's needed. The animators didn't cut corners with this show. It was solid job well done.
Sound/Music: 8/10 This is score slightly lower than the rest only because I wasn'y totally crazy with some of the opening themes. But the music in the show was fantastic. It brought emotion to parts that otherwise wouldn't be as exciting. For example, towards the end, someone is slowly walking towards a door and because the viewer knows what's on the other side of the door, the music brings all that much more emotion to the situation.
Characters: 10/10 One of the very best parts about FMAB for me was the characters for several reasons. One would be that there was no single character that didn't serve some sort of purpose. Side characters were used brilliantly and conncected the story together in ways that just worked so well. Even people that you thought were a once and done single episode character, would come back later in the series and be super important. The other reason the characters were so brilliant was because they were just well written. There wasn't one character I didn't like. Of course the villians weren't always likeable as people but they were just great villains. For a majority of the story you could easily hate them but somehow get attatched to them And even when SPOILER some of them die I felt myself feeling sorry for them even though they had been bad the entire time. And as for the good characters, there was something I liked about all of them and I just loved how they all worked together even when they sometimes didn't like each other. It was just a wonderful cast of characters.
Overall enjoyment: 10/10 There really isn't anything else to say other than that I strongly recommend you try this series. If you aren't familiar with the FMA universe this is a good place to start. While I haven't seen the original series, I've heard from various other people that this is much better than the orginal series. If you have seen the original series you'd probably want to try this as well because it can only get better. As far as dub vs sub I watched the dub so I really can't say anything about the subbed version. But I usually am someone who watches subbed and I usually can't stand dubs. But this one was fantastic and Funimation did a great job. So if you feel in the mood for a dub it's worthwhile. And if you like to stick with subs, then I'm sure that's going to be great as well.",10

                100/100.+ Beyond Masterpiece.
Before I start, I just want to say that I rate my series for the fun of it, and because I am truly a fan of anime. I do not consider myself to be a critic in any way, and I just rate my series depending on how much I appreciate them. Just so you know. I have watched hundreds of anime series ever since I was a kid, starting with Dragon Ball Z all the way up to (to date Aug 25th, 2017) Owarimonogatari second season (which is getting extremely high ratings, too!). 
Between those two shows I have seen what many
                  people consider to be the elite series ever (Evangelion, Death Note, Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass, Gintama, Attack on Titan and so forth). Furthermore, I have seen excellent, great, good, decent, and bad shows too, so I do consider myself to have some kind of experience in measuring the greatness of series. This is why, with my experience, I consider Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood to be the best show that I have seen as of today.
I have my favorite shows that I absolutely love and this show is not on that list. But I know those, within their greatness, have their flaws. And although Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is not perfect, I have to admit that nothing has come closer to perfection quite like it. 
This show made me understand that regardless of one's bias, greatness has to be applauded like it should. 
Every single aspect of it was perfectly executed: story, characters, animation (Wrath's fighting always looked sick), themes, writing, soundtracks, openings, endings, creativity, depth, heck even the previews were perfectly narrated to match the tension of each episode. Lead role is excellent, supporting characters are as good as (probably better) most main characters from other series. The way the story unfolds and ends is genius, and the diversity that this series brings allows each viewer to take different messages from it, which is why we fans (at least I!) watch. 
Opening/Ending theme songs are top class, specially during the episodes leading to the ""Promised Day"" (this is no spoiler, btw) where you feel like you want to just get inside the TV screen and support whoever it is you like (just listen to ""Rain"" during those episodes, and you will see what I'm talking about). 
The show had an ending that most people would not expect while watching the series, however, it felt just perfect again. It shut the door to an inspiring, thrilling, long, agonizing, fun, and perfectly executed story, that, until you've seen it, you have not seen it all. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the best anime series that I have seen. 
Score: The Anime Standard.

                Long ago, in the land of Ancient Greece-u, a man named Plato-kun formulated what he called his ""allegory of the care-aru"". For every thing, there is an ideal; all retarded fish based on the one true retarded fish in the realm of forms. Same thing for bodypillows, waifus, and, most importantly: anime. And if ever there was an anime that fulfilled the prophecy of the one series to rule them all, the championship belt could go to none other than Full Metal Fucking Alchemist.
Only through the perfect blend of over-used character tropes and robotic exposition could an anime be produced so perfectly that it's borderline
                  annoying. Right from the start, you get a subtle, nuanced sense of our main characters' cpmplex personalities; the whiny bitch-boy little brother whose English dub is less tolerable than the sound of Wolverine's claws over a chalkboard, and the tragically malformed Dwarf-child plagued with chronic lactose intolerance. 
Join them on their quest to un-fuck-up the fuck-up that killed their mother with the help of unforgettable side-characters, such as: 
- Tsundere the healer main
- Pending Emperor Chinaman
- Scarface
- and Mustache-Roids
Honestly though, you've already seen this anime- so just go watch, like, Shisekai Yori or some shit.",9
"
                This show has got to be one of the most well developed stories I've come upon. What I was most impressed by was the despite the complexity and genre of this story the writing kept it's integrity. Once you complete the show you realize that the writer knew what they were doing all along (which you would think is obvious but so many unfortunately do not do this) The characters and world building are fascinating and so much fun. The ideas of alchemy and biblical references and moral complications are utilized to a great affect. The dialogue is funny and natural, but the show can
                  get really serious too. A good balance and well paced. (At times it can drag a little but it's rare) You even learn a lot watching it. The art style isn't my cup of tea but it's tight and the production was given money so there's never a lag of quality really. This is definitely a good, palatable classic. I'd especially recommend this if you're just getting into anime.",10
"
                A WARNING!!! There are a couple of SPOILERS!
This version isn't as ""SUPAAAR"" as I supposed.
What is better then in first season? Art, sound, maybe sayu... But plot is worse... 
I don't think that the second season is understandable if you haven't watched the first one.
A lot of things were badly explained.
Some things were deleted. For example, episode about mines.
More than that, story about Shu Taker and Nina was short-cut. And it is not so emotional as it was given in the first season.
Also, occurrence on the train was deleted.
One more thing I didn't like is that there were no mistery. In the first season Ed's
                  auto-protez was firstly shown in the end of first episode. Here it was shown during the first 5 minutes.
So I'll repeat... It is supposed for someone who is ""ready"".
So... for me it is third variant of FMA.
It is not best - best is manga, but it is on the same level as first season.
My final word:  9 / 10 
ps sorry if my english is bad ^^",9
"
                This anime has been reviewed a thousand times over, all with high and generally positive scores for it. This is the only series which I have rated a 10 on my entire list because, if we're being honest, it's bloody amazing.
Story - The story is great, with brilliant scenes and emotional moments that would make anyone cry. There's one moment which I remember very clearly when Winry is holding a gun up to kill someone and Ed talks her down. Watching this was the first time I truly realised how amazing and inspiring an animated series could be. The plot is driven by the struggles
                  that the characters must go through to achieve their goals, and how they suffer their way to the end. It's storytelling at its best and, while there are some cliches, you feel like you're going on an adventure with the main characters!
Art - The animation is top notch and the character designs are stunning and realistic to their situations. There are characters from all kinds of origins and backgrounds- and their character designs reflect that in the best way. The animation is also so clean and smooth that I actually had to rewind every once in a while just because I wanted to see the scenes again and marvel at the production quality.
Sound- The opening and closing themes are honestly some of the most beautiful I've ever heard and fit perfectly with the mood and tone of the series. And, oh, the soundtrack! The soundtrack was a shining example of everything a soundtrack could be- blending perfectly into the scenes and giving them that extra 'oomph'. 
Character - The characters were absolutely the best characters I'd ever seen in an anime. Most shounen anime has a problem with characterisation, but FMA:B does it excellently! Ed and Al are very realistically brothers and are very realistically people, with their faults and their strengths. And the female characters? I haven't seen many anime that treat female characters so well and give them the same level of development as their male counterparts.
Enjoyment - I was never bored watching this series and even the quieter moments in the story were entertaining, with the characters really carrying the plot (not that the plot needed carrying). 
This is the best darn anime I've seen in a very long time, and it's an excellent first anime because it's set in a fantasy world, with no prior knowledge of Japanese customs needed to enjoy it and understand it!",10
"
                Brotherhood will forever remain my all time favorite series, in fact I started watching anime all thanks to Brotherhood. The series has the most unpredictable storyline to it with so many plots and turns incorporating action, mystery, humor, romance,... Once you think the bad guy is about to be eliminated, another even bigger one shows up. I don't even know if there is a single character including the antagonists that I dislike. Every character had their own back story buying sympathy from the audience. Even with so many magical components in the story, the story is still believable since the plot is not unraveled immediately,
                  but with each ongoing second that adds another clue that soon builds up to the climax. The ending definitely leaves the audience with that depressed feeling of ""what to do next"" after watching an amazing story. Overall this series is a must-see if you want to see a fast-paced story with a little bit of everything.",10
"
                Edited: 5/March/2016, some grammar errors fixed.
As someone who has seen the original FMA I can certainly convince that FMA Brotherhood was presented in much better and effective way.
Story: FMA: Brotherhood did very well without leaving any difficult thoughts about ""plot-holes"" at all. Brotherhood has a well-made continuous story which ofc has some flashbacks so the viewer gets more source to the character backgrounds and can understand them better. The smartest thing they did in this story in my opinion is the ending. They applied  their own ""Alchemy"" -law and took advantage of it. Ending doesn't have to be a tragic to be good -
Ishval
                  Civil War gives depth to army veterans.
Fort Briggs serves as a some kind of side story which has a meaning when approaching the end and the story OVERALL. 
Personally I feel that the story is really something that takes you to the World of Alchemy. It's not all about happiness, sadness or jokes. This feels somehow realistic. Story wasn't predictable and especially the ending.
Pacing is really good like mentioned above.
10/10
Art: Character hairs are little bit natural and the animation gives off this ""realistic"" kind of vibe. Through the episodes art felt solid and did not get worse. Background/scenery are simply breathtaking.  [Not Garden of Words level but FMA: Brotherhood is older]. On the other hand I don't feel that the houses/objects had that much of details.
9/10
Sound: This is one of the aspects where Brotherhood shines. Every OP and ED are EXCELLENT. To be honest I don't listen to ED:s but Brotherhood was one of those anime where I watched OP:s and ED:s. My favorite OP:s are 1 and 4. Very compelling songs. [Fav. ED 5 and 4] Background themes/osts are also pure gold, they enhance emotions, action and strokes of a wit! Characters voice sounds very natural and pleasing, the definitely know how to do the voice acting!
10/10
Characters: Side characters are excellent, they may even tell little bit of background story about other characters so the viewer understands why he and she does this and acts like that. Every character has their flaws and strengths like in real life and no one seemed unusually strong. Elric brothers also make character progression when they get to know other people hard/tough backgrounds and empathize to them. While on journey Elric brothers find sadness, despair, happiness and you can feel their emotions. Villains for once had a ""real"" motivation to do things their way and background was added for depth. Scar is one of the early villains seen in the anime and they built pretty good background story which wasn't separate to some other characters background. 
10/10
Enjoyment: After I have done this review I feel like watching Brotherhood for the 3rd time. IT just never gets old. Even though I have watched it, I watch some parts from the anime from time to time. I have also put OP:s in my Youtube playlist. When characters/people feel sad or are ready stand up after failure it just keeps you motivated and reflects those feelings. 
My sister who wasn't a fan of anime watched this with me because in our childhood we saw FMA on TV. Even though some time has passed I can still remember some scenes well.
10/10
Overall: What can you expect from an Anime that has done story very-well, put depth to characters and made excellent songs? At the cost of 64 episodes is little when compared to what has been achieved! I hope some unmentioned anime would increase their episodes so they can built a good story and ""world"", though I'm not entirely sure if it would work...",10

                My 14 year old brother sat me down and insisted that I watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. I was quite reluctant at first having not really enjoyed the first few episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist, however, as I progressed through the series, I began to see just how wrong I was. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood takes you on a quite a journey that leaves you on the edge of your seat as it gets heated up with action. Not to mention the story is just brilliant and one of a kind. However, what I praise most of all about this series is its ending. What a perfectly executed
                  ending. I could not have asked for a better one. It's ending understands that not everyone in this series can have everything they want, and that's exactly what they portrayed, leaving its audience with a content feeling in their gut that will last them for days after completing it.",10
"
                Today I realized that I never reviewed by favorite anime thus far (right up there with HXH). I never reviewed it because I thought everyone already knew about it and watched it. What spurred me to write this review is the fact that Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood has lost its seat in first place to an anime movie that came out this year, Kimi no na wa...
Why?
It hasn't even been out for a year and yet it beats FMAB and many other fantastic shows. I just don't understand. I watched it and liked it and gave it an 8. It doesn't deserve first place. FMAB does,
                  and here's why.
If I could name every little detail that makes this anime shine, I would, but no one has time for that and neither do I so I'll just talk about the details a little. I've watched this show at least a dozen times in the past 4 years. Probably more. I never get sick of it. How is that possible? Because this show has everything. It does nothing wrong. 
Ed's design. Long golden hair braided down the back. Golden eyes. Angry expression. Red jacket. Gloves. Automail arm and leg. Boots. He stands out. He doesn't look silly but he doesn't look normal either. It's a unique design that reflects his personality perfectly. As for his personality, he is a very well-developed character. He's also my favorite anime character of all time.
The enemies. They themselves are likable. They feel like they have a purpose other than to get in the way of the protagonist and they go through character development as well. Also, they're strong and aren't defeated with ""the power of friendship."" 
The beginning (excluding the filler first episode) sucked me in immediately, personally. It's tragic but the tragedy is what drew me in. It tells you what you need to know, grabs your attention, and then shoves you off. It seamlessly moves you through the story and every decision the characters make or everywhere they decide to go makes sense.
The soundtrack is great. I've downloaded about half of it (my favorite songs from the OST) and listened to the songs over and over again. I never get tried of hearing them. The openings and endings are great too.
The art is great. I don't know what else to say here. I just wouldn't have it any other way.
The plot is of course amazing. I always think about how the author managed to come up with something so amazing. My goal is to mirror her skills somehow with my own writing.
It's a complete story. No need to read the manga. It has a fantastic ending. Everything you want to happen, happens. It also teaches a very powerful lesson.
Another biased opinion to add to this review, but I've always watched the anime subbed and I love Ed's voice actor. Envy's too.
Alchemy is cool and Ed is a master at it. Even though he is already good at alchemy (and thus doesn't get any better at it), this isn't a detriment to the show. While his alchemy skills don't necessarily develop, Ed does and what he decides to do with those skills changes based on his development.
This review is just all over the place. I don't know what else to say. If this isn't your thing that's fine. But according to my opinion, FMAB is a masterpiece.",10

                Unfortunately, this dosnt alow decimals, because if it did, I would give this an overall 9.35, but that's besides the point.
Fullmetal Achemist Brotherhood is a wonderful anime, and I highly recommend it, however, it has its flaws, but a lot of parts of the anime makes up for it.
The opening and endings are great in my opinion, the animation isn't they best thing, but they handled Sparks and even fire better, and again, it very worth your time, but I recommend watching the original BEFORE you watch Brotherhood.
That's its main flaw, and after you watch the original, because in Brotherhood, theres gonna be about 12
                  episodes of the same thing in the original, but after those 12 episodes, Brotherhood takes off to a whole new story.
I enjoyed this anime a lot, and the last thing is, do not watch this if you're very sensitive to gore, harsh language, some religion-ish stuff, and some sexual parts of the anime, however, rest assured, there isnt many sexual scenes.",9

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the best Shonen anime ever. Not just that but, this is also one of the best anime I have ever seen. Though, personally, I haven't seen the previous FMA adaptation so, I won't compare both of these show on this review.
On a world where alchemy exists, you will embark on a journey with Edward Elric and his brother, Alphonse Elric. After these two lost their Mom, they tried reviving her by performing human transmutation. However, it did not work and instead, Edward loses Alphonse. Edward then tried to put Alphonse's soul on a large armor and it did work but in
                  exchange, Edward loses his limbs. So, because of this incident, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric will get their bodies back which is to find the Philosopher's stone. However, as they try to find it, they discover something dark with this stone and within the nation.
The story is told straightforward and there are no fillers on this show (Well, there's actually one recap episode). As the story goes on, it gets better and better. More mysteries are discovered, connections, and how these wraps up until the end. Though, a few people complains on how light this series is, well, it's a Shonen anime. What really matters to me on how well-driven the story is. Especially that great ending.
The animation is pretty good and simple, but it isn't the best. Some of it's fight scenes can be good (smooth) while some can be pretty mediocre. So, it can be inconsistent (In terms of fight scenes but, the artwork itself is consistent until the end). It's simplicity though does fit the show as it is a Shonen anime. 
Same goes to the soundtrack - good, but not the best. It's soundtrack can be really repetitive at the first part of the show but, they introduced more soundtrack as the show goes on. Also, give props to the Seiyuus. Each of them really fit the characters itself thus, captures it's emotion. I love every OPs and EDs except for Opening 4. 
The characters on this show are outstanding. What makes them outstanding is how they really react to every situation as the story goes on. This was done very realistic. The villains are great because of what they truly desire. Pretty much every other characters have a purpose on this show and they have a goal. They were not just thrown in randomly.
Overall, I enjoyed this show to the fullest. This show is indeed a masterpiece. There were just too many moments that were really great on this show. This is a series I'll never forget. I recommend this show to everyone - newcomers, Shonen fans and even fans who doesn't really crave to Shonen. Just watch this show now.
Score: 9.6/10 (Because of my enjoyment factor, it is rounded up to 10/10)",10

                Overrated? Just a tad…but still amazing!
Before the protests and angry comments start, let me say that I watched Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood without watching the original adaptation. Some of my good friends (who know my taste in anime) recommended Brotherhood because they thought I would get too bored to watch both. I might watch the original adaption later, but regardless - let's dive right into the review!
Story (7/10) - ""In order for something to be obtained, something of equal value must be lost."" The story is set around this premise - and the creators do one hell of a job making it work. Interestingly, this is
                  different from most other anime because it not only gives Brotherhood a central theme, but it also logically order many of the different pieces of the story. For example, the whole idea of alchemy, Philosopher's Stones, and all of the fighting would not be possible without this theme of Equivalent Exchange. It makes a ton of sense - and for me, that adds to the pleasure. 
The plot is also quite solid. It has twists and turns that you might expect from Death Note, while at the same time having various dynamic story arcs (with some arcs being better than others). And I am a total sucker for these kind of stories because they keep me both deeply entertained and inspired. From the development of the villains to unraveling the crooked history of the past, I assure you that you will not get bored. The only negative comment regarding the development is that the seemingly good side never seems to get stronger - while the homunculus get new powers due to the Stones, the good guys just increase their numbers. 
Now, the critique. I found that while the first 30 or so episodes had a really solid grip on the plot, the next 25 episodes just lost control. I feel like some of the fighting felt forced, the main characters disappeared or had weak roles, and  then toward the convergence in Central City toward the end - I was just like “WTF is going on?” There are a few unanswered/rushed aspects such as Flame Alchemy, true differences between the East and the West, how did Father come into existence, where did all the soul eating Dolls go, why did Kimblee help Edward overcome Selim, etc. 
In conclusion - the strength, entertaining aspects, and inspiring beauty of the OVERALL story overcome a great deal of the confusion and keep the score at a solid 7.
Art and Sound (7/10 and 9/10 respectively) - The openings and closing of Brotherhood are just phenomenal. For example while there is a lot of debate about how good of a show Naruto: Shippuuden is, most people agree that the openings and closings are legendary and complement the emotional effect of the anime really nicely. FMA: Brotherhood has the same effect. So - if you are watching the show on a free platform that does not have the openings and closing scenes built in, make sure you watch them! In the actual anime, the soundtracks have solid timing in all the crucial scenes (which is common in all really solid anime), which helps bring that inspiring awe to the show. The show graphics are pretty solid - nothing “masterpiece” worthy though. 
Character (9/10) - The reputation of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brother really justifies itself in this category. Nearly all the characters are praiseworthy in their own respect. The Elric brothers embark an incredible journey that begins with taboo, but ends with a grueling test of their naive ideals for a better life. Roy Mustang is a sleek, good-willed patriot who isn’t afraid to take matters into his own hand. His loyal crew is praiseworthy. I also love Hughes - typical happy dude. I’m thinking of all the other characters, but the thing is that there are so many that are acted out so well that I don’t think listing them all will do justice. I mean everything is perfect…except one major thing…no development in powers (i know it’s childish, but the point is valid). In the end, when the Ishbalans finally unlock the Eastern transmutation circle that is supposed to increase alchemy powers and Edward makes an epic entrance in battle, what happens? NOTHING. THERE IS LITERALLY NO DIFFERENCE. I mean I was expecting some bloody fireworks and the show gave us some lame sparklers. 
Overall (8/10) - Look. Brotherhood is an amazing show. I am just a very picky dude so I tore it apart in places where most people don’t give a shit. Overall, the show is phenomenal and is an absolute must-watch for any anime fan.
Verdict - while I do not think it should be in the top 3 anime of all time, I still think it’s pretty freaking awesome and definitely worthwhile.",8

Story: 10
The story for fmab was just amazing. I nice plot that develops quite well as the show goes along. There are many surprises along the way, and various interesting characters to meet. The viewer is always interested in what is going to happen next and who is the big villain. It had me engrossed right from the beginning.

The character animation was just flawless. The art was too good. 
Sound: 10
All the openings and endings were
                  marvelous. I loved listening to every single one, and even downloaded them all. The soundtrack fit perfectly into every scene. Whether it was a happy moment or a rather depressing moment, the soundtrack was perfect. The voice actors also did an excellent job

                Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, the greatest anime of all time, hands down!!!
The story is outstanding in all aspects, its spectacular, amazing and jaw dropping. The mood is so DARK and mature, its only for adults. I was not bored for a second  single second because the story was just so intriguing, complex and deep. I just needed to know what happened next, it was just written so extremely well. And there are just so many philosophical elements that make one think about life and existence as we know it like equivalent exchange. I can't even put my feelings into words. Solid 10/10, A+ story.
                  
The art and sound are excellent and amazing..everything fits and the entire anime is enhanced by them. The stunning and crisp art and the otherworldly music make this anime a wonder of the anime world.
Characters..all of them are incredibly well developed. So deep and realistic, fleshed out and constructed so well. You end up liking all of the characters and developing an attachment to them because they are so real. Amazing what anime can do when put in the right hands, the masterful hands of  Arakawa Hiromu. And the homunculi...WOW..best anime villains ever!
Enjoyment is out of this world. Watching FMAB is like having a taste of heaven. I watched this anime in two days and I was just sucked into the story and world. Once you start you cant stop. 
Overall, FMAB is a behemoth in the history of anime!! Never before have I seen an anime so superb on all fronts, this is an anime that comes out once in a millenium. If you havent watched this show yet watch it now, cuz youre missing a lot!!
10/10 in all categories. MASTERPIECE.",10

                I have only been a member on MAL for 2 days, but for those who know who I am, you know I don't like anime as much as manga.
But I have to admit, I love Brotherhood. It sticks with the manga all the way through unlike the original anime. I wish people would watch this instead of the original FMA anime. They always say Brotherhood is a continuation of the original and it's just really annoying. Seriously, Brotherhood needs more credit. The plot is 100% original. No alterations of any kind (from what I can tell).
Brotherhood is also one of the very few animes where
                  I actually like the English dub. With anime I tend to go subbed b/c dubbed usually sucks [voice not connected with characters, horrible actor choice, etc.], but Vic Mignogna plays Ed's voice SO well. It literally fits his character to a T. So this is literally one of the only good English dub animes I have ever seen.
So yeah... very enjoyable. I watched all the episodes without yelling ""THAT WASN'T SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN!!!!!"" which is like... rare. -_-",9
"
                What to say about the number one charted anime on this whole site? Well.
I came into the anime world thinking I watched this anime, this was the first serious one I ever watched after the regular Pokemon, Digimon, Dragon Ball Z, Bleach, Naruto  - quintet. Only, as it turns out I watched the first edition, not Brotherhood. 
It took me a good year to realize Brotherhood exists and oh my, was I over joyed to know there was more of the fascinating story about alchemists. 
First thing that instantly caught my attention- the opening. The music was so good the entire time it was
                  ridiculous, opening after opening, I kept getting more intrigued. Usually, there's always one song I don't like but not in this case, no, in this case I liked ending too which happens exactly never. Still, I think that one thing the first edition has over Brotherhood is the music. Not in openings but the scene music sang in Russian. Amazing. 
The other thing I liked was how clean the art looked. There's nothing much I can say here, the style of drawing is specific in a way you can immediately know it's FMAB you're watching. 
Now, onto the characters. 
Edward and Alphonse are our protagonists and while there's the usual trope (genius kids having super-amazing powers that even adults can't handle) it's not exactly true. Oh you think it is until it's very quickly proven that someone /can/ take Edward on, and that Edward /can/ advance on the field of power. But more than that, it's the character development that you like. Just like in real life, Edward and Alphonse have their ups and downs, the downs of course being more prominent,  and they have their hurdles and orders to get over. They also have to deal with their goals and disappointments, and generally dealing with the not-so- ideal world where they get to live until they're ninety and their friends don't die. 
The alchemy of the world is rather interesting. Actually, the whole storyline that's discovered bits by bits, is more than interesting, exposed from multiple angles. The theories of life, world, everything and nothing, the chase for immorality and knowledge, FMAB deals with every question separately but connected by string until you understand. 
Truly, this anime is one of the best I will ever watch and will ever be made. The care put into connecting this world with ours via perpetual questions and faults of humanity is astounding, as is almost each and every moment of this story. Completely worth watching sixty-four episodes.",10
"
                This is hands down one of the greatest anime shows ever produced.
The Story of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood follows the journey of Edward and Alphonse Elric as they search for the philosopher stone to bring back their dead mother. They try to do a human transmutation, but in doing so Alphonse lost his body and Edward lost his left leg. In a last minute effort to get his brother back Edward bounds Alphonse's body to a suit of armor and that cost him his right arm. His limbs were replaced with automail and later became a state alchemist. Now this adaptation is more of a direct
                  adaptation to the manga and it excels against it's predecessor. This story is very heavy when it comes to what the characters are feeling. For example there is a death in this show that is still one of the saddest deaths in anime and you see just how his death effects the people around him. And when Roy Mustangs finds the people responsible for his friends death he goes fucking berserk on them. The boys eventually find the ingredients to create a philosopher stone only to find out that the secret ingredient is a immense amount of human sacrifices.
The voice acting in FMA: Brotherhood perfect. Vic Mignogna is outstanding as Edward Elric and Travis Willingham as Roy Mustang is superb.
The Characters in FMA: Brotherhood are all phenomenal characters. Edward and Alphonse have one of the best sibling relationships in any T.V. show that I've ever seen. Roy Mustang is also a very, very good character because he is a BADASS! There is also Fuhrer Bradley who is honestly a character that takes a complete 180 throughout the course of this anime.
Overall Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a masterpiece truly a work of art. It has everything from comedy, action, drama, character development, and story. Everything about this anime was great there were few if any problems with this anime and that is why a gave this show a 10/10.",10
"
                Nearly brilliant in all aspects I would say. The characters are well developed and all of them are like-able, even the villains too. Unlike most animes, the flow of the anime tend to fall off, technically being stagnant like Naruto and SAO. FMA Brotherhood on the other hand is able to keep viewers on screen all time, as the plot line is intriguing and filled with ambiguity in a good way.
The soundtrack of the series is arguably the best I have heard in a long time. The first opening and ending is legendary. All in all this a good anime if want to binge watch
                  over the holidays. I personally think that this anime is a masterpiece and a classic and I do not frequently praise an anime so greatly.",10
"
                This anime is really boring and i had to force my self to watch it. I don't know why this anime is so popular or even considered as the best anime. When i first watched it, i was expecting it to have really good fights and cool power ups but instead i got the characters talking unnecessary rubbish all the time and the fights are lame, like no power ups.. Nothing, i have seen better shows like fairy tail and Naruto which have better written story then this. Like the main enemy  is really shallow and uninteresting. What is even the plot of this
                  show? i want to tell the creators how to write a good story or at least take notes from others shows like bleach.",4
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood differ in story, character, and art style. Comparing one to the other is hard and time consuming. So to put in simple terms FMA, the anime made before FMAB was as good as its successor but not better. FMA's plot  changes halfway into the anime. The point is that FMA had a darker view on the characters and their actions, and had a more serious tone to the situation the character was in. FMAB conentrated on the manga's story line, character development, and had a more comical and light view on situations in the anime. FMAB caught my
                  attention in episode 26 where we get to look at Hoenheim's past or, so called past dream; but the point is is that FMAB had a better formula and caught the attention of many fans and viewers. The other other important detail of why FMAB is better than FMA is the ending; more people seem to enjoy the happier and joyful moments than Edward being sent to another dimension all of his life but no biggie. All I'm trying to say in retrospect is that both are fantastic but one must be chosen to be better than the other, but everyone has their own opinion.",10
"
                I'm not going to sugar coat this or put too much effort into this review, I'm just going to leave it at this. This is a story anyone, young or old, weeb or not, can enjoy.  The show has very few flaws, and the few it does you'll feel like an asshole for pointing them out.
I've talked to various friends, some who aren't even into anime that said they have enjoyed this show. Again, this is a show that anyone can enjoy. 
Basically I can't think of any flaws I can name here, and I find no need to spoil any of the story,
                  so I'll keep it short. 
10/10 around the board. A truly fitting MAL number 1.

                As everyone knows there are two series of FMA. The original FMA and Brotherhood. Both are really great, and consist of two different ending. Brotherhood is based on the events that were included in the manga, and in my opinion the more superior series. 
It took me a while to watch the series. I kept on contemplating whether to watch it and when, and then i finally decided to watch it last summer. It started off really good and captured my attention right off the bat. It was a gripping tale of two brothers trying to get the bodies back, brotherhood and family. 
The main
                  charcters; Ed and Alphonse are just very lovable and you can't help but root for them on their journey. Other characters like Roy Mustang, Hughs and Armstrong all come together to make an awesome support cast. The series also has alot of STRONG female characters which is something I love to see in an anime. They were tough and stood their ground and were not overshadowed by the males.
Brotherhood is my upmost favourite anime series I've seen. Since watching it last summer, I have watched it an additional 2 times, purely at the fact that I love everything about the series. 
The comedic elements that they have, to the touching issues about race, war and other moral issues that come into play. The show will take you on an unexpected jouney of laughter and tears and ultimately joy.",10
"
                Hm..my first time writing a review. Lol lol watch me mess up.
Anyways..from reading previous reviews and reading comments made on the forums, I think people are being too critical of the new anime. It's only got /12/ episodes so far; give it a little break people, lol. Twelve episodes doesn't define if the anime is going to be brilliant or trash. My point being, as many people haven't read the manga and are only comparing it to the first anime, they're getting very wrong impressions. Yes yes I know, the first anime was good. However, going about and saying ""god, this is so /boring/, it's
                  just retelling the same old story just rushed"" isn't fair. As a dedicated follower of the manga, this anime is going to have a VERY different plot--starting in about one or two more episodes, I believe. So please don't judge something as ""same old same old"" when it's just getting started, m'kay? ^^
Okay, I'll just shut up about that now and get to the actual review..thing..of this.
Story : 8
So far, Brotherhood is following pretty dang closely to the manga, which definitely makes me happy. I can assure you, the manga has a developed plot with interesting twists, characters, and very dark turns, while still keeping a nice blend of comedy in there. After our encounter with Greed, nothing will be at all like the first series; no Dante, no Wrath (well, no Wrath from the first series), no parrallel world, nothing like that. Hopefully the ""rushed"" feeling will also disappear, as Brotherhood will finally be caught up with the first series and can start with completely fresh material. (Note : The anime already has shown its share of fresh material, such as the eleventh episode, but meh.) 
Brotherhood as a story is keeping up well and its already shown its darker shades, such as the incident with Nina and Tucker, and Ed and Al's failed resurrection of their mother and its consequences. There have been some things from the story that has bothered me, though, like how many chapters have all been condensed into one episode. Some examples would be the second episode (probably the most rushed of all the series thus far), the eleventh, and the twelfth. Though most of it was stuff that doesn't really hurt the plotline itself if left out, still kind of disappointing. And though I've seen some people argue that it's not rushed at all, and some argue it's completley rushed, I'd give it a medium. There are many episodes (like eps. 4, which many complained about seeing the lack of Nina like in the first series) that only have one chapter to begin with, so yeah, it's not as rushed as it seems.
The comedy also isn't at its best; though it is a change from the complete darkness of the ending of FMA 1 and it fits the general mood of the manga FMA (having a great blend of seriousness, darkness, and comedy), some of the comedy isn't done as well as I'd expected. It seems like it fit more in the manga than it did in the animation, if you know what I mean. 
Overall Art : 7
I give it a 7, as it definitely follows the manga art, but still not the best I've ever seen. The houses, like Ed and Al's home, generally irritate me because they seem so childish. It may resemble the manga version, but it /fits/ in the manga; in this series, it's silly. Some of the characters (like Hughes and Scar) seem plain stupid art wise, and bleh. From the preview, Greed didn't look that great either. Still, the art is good enough to be enjoyed when it's serious. 
Sound : 7
Once again, I give it a 7. The music is growing on me admittedly, and come on, the beginning and ending themes are to die for. Not much of a real opinion here though.
Character : 7
It hasn't gotten as far into the story yet to make a real opinion; characters don't develop much over a measley 12 episodes when there's such a larger piece of it to come. However, the characters so far are unique and interesting, as I've always found them. For those of you (like me) who were generally annoyed by Alphonse's character, fear not, for he has a much more developed and just plain different personality here. He is not at all the wimpy little brother we knew in FMA 1; he knows how to handle himself and has a much more mature character. As far as I can remember, the characters seem pretty much the same as they were in FMA 1 (for the mean time anyways, as far as it has gotten in this). So yeah..we need a bit more time to see how these characters develop.
Enjoyment : 8
Pretty good so far; seeing the characters all back together and seeing the manga's true plot unfold in animation is undeniably enjoyable for fans of the manga. A bit rushed at times (like episode 2), but it's an enojyment in itself to watch Fullmetal Alchemist unfold. Comedy is a bit dull in places, though.
Overall : 7
My overall review would be a 7, I suppose. Once the series gets to a certain point, I may come back and review to see if my opinion has changed at all.",7
"
                Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood in a word: Solid
*Side Note: At the time of writing this review, I have not yet finished watching the original Full Metal Alchemist and I have not read the manga. In other words, this is just judging Brotherhood without comparing it to anything else.
It was fantastic. By the time I finished it, everything felt solid. I wasn't left with any questions, I didn't desire any further detail or explanation of events, I didn't need any more character development. So yeah, solid. 
The one thing I think people relate to the most while watching this is the bond between Edward and Alphonse.
                  We all have that one person (friend or family) who we would do anything for, our partner in crime, someone who we know will always have our back and it's enjoyable to watch an anime where the focus is on two characters who have this attachment to each other. 
Besides the character relationships, this anime is jammed packed with creative villains, intense action, moments of heartbreak, and an imaginative plot. 
There is honestly nothing that I would change about it. Everything was well laid out.
That being said, I'm not sure if it really is worthy of the #1 ranking spot. Top 10, definitely. However, I feel like there are a couple other animes out there that seem to be better suited for a #1 ranking. It's a fantastic anime, but I wouldn't consider it the best anime I have ever seen. 
Still loved it though!",10
"
                SPOILER ALERT- you have been warned!!
Y'know if there's anyone out there that hasn't actually seen this yet...I think I might've been the last one.
I don't write reviews at all and this will be my very first, however with something as popular as this, I felt inclined to review it due to the mix of emotions I have about it. 
So then, there are two Shounen anime viewed in ridiculously high regard. One is Hunter x Hunter (2011) and the other is Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, both of which are remakes of much older and incomplete series. Now Hunter x Hunter (2011) is one of my favourite
                  anime of all time and since I was looking for a well regarded Shounen to fill that void, I decided upon this one since it has been recommended to me ever since it started airing. I thought, “why not? If it’s anything like HxH then I’ll be happy to watch it”. Naturally then, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood had a lot to live up to for me regarded as a modern classic, seen as the best Shounen ever created (even better than HxH) and even as the pinnacle of anime. 
On that I'd have to disagree, but all in all it is a good, solid series that has universal appeal, even outside of the anime community. Although perhaps I set my expectations a little too high; add to this the fact that I've never entertained the original 2003 anime or the manga, and you've got one very tough customer. 
Firstly, the animation and music score are consistently above average and deserve praise; the first opening theme “Again” by Yui, the third opening theme “Golden Time Lover” by Sukima Switch and the first ending theme “Uso” by SID were the visual and musical standouts for me. 
Edward and Alphonse also make a really great pair of main characters given their contrasting personalities; I was surprised to not find myself constantly annoyed by the teenage protagonist and deuteragonist of a Shounen anime since that’s usually the case (sadly). The lack of randomly placed fan service, along with diverse character designs and badass female characters were also plus points for me. They definitely added to the more mature themes of life, death, reincarnation and what it means to be human and sin. Rarely did FMAB feel like a Shounen anime, but only after you reflect upon its message do you realize this.
Additionally, by the end, you really do feel a sense of fulfilment when things go right for the Elric brothers; it was so rewarding to see Alphonse get his body back in particular since he’d been struggling for so long without it. Though, despite popular opinion that the anime is nearby perfect, I thought there were quite a few problems when it came to story presentation and characters in particular...although that's just me. For starters, the only relationships that feel “real” and have depth are that of Ed & Al and Mustang & Hawkeye- it’s a good job though, because those are some of the most important in the story. 
I honestly didn't connect with the main cast all that much however, & despite not disliking them I didn't particularly care for them either though I can't put my finger on why. The animation was beautiful, as was the underlying message/moral and music, but it just felt like something was missing. As if there was no real heart in the adaptation & more so just an intrinsic need to plough through the material. Character deaths weren't as impactful as they should've been, and despite having so many episodes there were still a lot of things that I would've liked to have seen from the series.
More development for the homunculi, more information about the origins of alchemy itself, definitely more story covering the situation in Xing (that could’ve had a whole damn arc), Trisha and Hohenheim’s relationship, as well as his journey since he was such an important character. How did he meet and fall in love with her? What about his travels throughout his four hundred plus years of life? It’s all just left to the viewers’ imagination, and whilst I don’t particularly like being spoon fed everything, it just feels like a bit of lazy writing and lack of imagination to me. Take Hughes for example, he is a huge motivation to Mustang both in life and in death, but it never truly feels like he is. It’s like the series wanted to wring emotion out of me when he died, but the author didn’t know how to do so in a remarkable and impactful way, so it came off as a little contrived. If we got more depth and time with certain events and characters, then perhaps the series would’ve elicited more emotion out of me because god knows the potential was there.
Such things, whilst not exactly necessary to the overarching plotline, are what create those emotional connections, plant those roots and glue the relationships and characters together. And that’s what I feel was missing from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. There were a huge set of colourful and interesting side characters (as well as possible subplots) that never got the spotlight they deserved. Take Greed, Lust, Ling, Olivier, Hughes, Izumi and Kimblee in particular, who are just ploughed through and shoved back into their respective boxes after their initial introductions (only to be brought out now and again). We don’t get time to connect with anything all that much because of how fast paced the story is…things happened- big things- but it never feels like they did. Things never have as much presence as they should, and there are moments where the story feels painstakingly slow and uneventful, despite so many things going on.
The series never gave more than what was absolutely necessary and whilst that could be seen as a positive, for me it felt like a bit of the good ol’ wasted potential. The plot was well crafted, and the ideas were great, but at the end of the final episode there was no “wow! That was amazing”, it was more like “well that was nice”.
Sure there was a happy end, but by the time I reached the finish line I realized I hadn’t learned anything about the main characters that I hadn’t known from the very beginning.
Despite their eventful journey and all of the things they learned and lost, I can’t say there was really many changes within them, and whilst that’s not particularly a bad thing, it just made the outcome and conclusion a little underwhelming for me. At least it got an ending though, which is more than I can say for a lot of other Shounen anime; the problem here is that I think it ended too soon as opposed to being dragged out like many other series’ of the same breadth.
In conclusion, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a very good anime that’ll stick with me, but it’s definitely not the best and is by no means as close to the perfection people suggest. There were some standout moments though, especially when it came to Van Hohemheim, and I may or may not feel inclined to throw it into my favourites one day.",7

                Everything about this anime make make smile, From the character development and their beliefs, to their own motives and the effect they cause on others by pursuing their dreams.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a roller coaster of emotions one minute you're happy the next you're angry. The story in itself and messages behind it is just 10/10. For example ishballan Genocide and how it created more rage, revenge and hate that turned into a never ending cycle. Or how Edward Elric at the start of the anime believed that ""alchemists are the closest thing to god"". But at the end he contradicted his beliefs saying that
                  ""we truly all are just ordinary humans"" He was able to live without alchemy because he had his friends and family by his side. Or the part when Colonel Roy Mustang cried at his best friends grave Brigadier General Hughes saying ""I think it's about to rain"" to Lt Riza Hawkeye, Then proceeding to cry meaning that Roy felt useless that he couldn't help his friend, because when it rains he is useless.
Seriously if you haven't already seen this anime JUST WATCH IT!!!!
I have re watched this 7 times :D
It's just so good, overall rank 11/10.",10

                FMA: Brotherhood was an anime I was on and off with for years. My friend recommended it to me as an introduction to anime as it seemed to him, right up my street. I could have taken that any other way on retrospect.
I was given the first 2 volumes on DVD by him to watch. At first, I thought nothing of it cos at the time, I had this stigma against western anime fans that they were all, basically, weaboos and being associated with them, to me, felt like being associated with that one ugly kid in school who smells like beef.
However, once I got
                  into it, I found Brotherhood to be very good. I found the worldbuilding truelly detailed and absorbing while the characters were all believable and fun to watch in their own way. Even the homunculi villains were entertaining in some form or another, my particular favourite being Greed. His arc is incredibly predictable but his character makes it more poignant at times during the story.
I found the philosophy of FMA Brotherhood quite intriguing as it can be interpreted in many different ways though I'll probably save that discussion for a blog post later down the line.
I even found the ending pretty satisfying if slightly jarring in contrast to the end of the world plot that occurs just before hand (and more so now that I have also watched the original FMA anime as of typing). Which brings me to the action. The one thing that stood out to me in this anime was how quickfire the fight scenes were. The only anime I had been exposed to beforehand (not counting the Pokemon and Digimon cartoons) were Dragonball Z and Attack on titan, both I thought had incredibly drawn out fight scenes which became more tedious to watch as I got older.
The fights in Brotherhood normally last upwards of 10 minutes not counting the 23 minute final fight episode, which is really all it needs to get its point across. The fight scene is something used in action media to keep the story from becoming bogged down in exposition and drama. Its something that is supposed to pump you up and get you really excited. That effect is lost when its drawn out to more than 2 episodes and it just slows down the story. FMA Brotherhood laughs in the face of that trope and instead has fight scenes that are fast-paced and over before you know they're occuring. The Alchemy concept makes for varied fight scenes in characters and abilities from shapeshifting, shadow powers, fire bending, weapon materialisation and golem-style suits of armour clattering together like monkeys fighting in a saucepan cupboard.
Speaking of Alchemy, its a very unique ability for both an aesthetic standpoint and a narrative plot device. Its used in tonnes of interesting and comedic ways while its also the crux of the mythos of the show, as well as the driving force for the main characters, the Elric brothers, to achieve their overall goal they set themselves at the start.
My only real complaint comes from the portrayal of Father, the almighty big bad of the conflict at hand. His origins are never truly explained and his motivation seems to just stem from some dumb xenophobia towards none-artificial life that is never really characterised. Plus after all the hype he gets about how powerful he is, his final fight scene with Ed Elric is completely...well, without wishing to drop any spoilers, its like a boss fight in a video game that ends up being won in under 3 minutes cos you spent all your time putting points into that one move you purchased yonks ago that has rapid attacks and makes you invulnerable while you're using it. It just took the conflict right out of the story for me.
But this is a nitpick on my end and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was the anime that got me into watching other anime shows, and so I think my score may come from some form of personal bias for being my first true anime.
But even without that, I still think everything in this show works to make it worthy of an acclaimed reputation.
No doubt once I completed watching Brotherhood, I made it my duty to try the original FMA series which I heard takes a different route to Brotherhood and is apparently commonly considered the better interpretation. So that'll be my next review...",9
"
                I've just recently complete FMAB, 5 years after i finished the 2003 series.
I loved the first series, but Brotherhood blows it out of the water!
Brotherhood explores various complex and interesting themes such as; morality and the need for revenge. The murder of Nina as a chimera challenged the beliefs of the Elrics' as they witnessed, through their eyes, the destruction of a little girl. These emotional scenes constantly challenge the ideals that the boys possess. These scenes are done extremely well in the anime because the viewer is able to see conflicting views and truly share the heartache of the characters.
Brotherhood may feel slightly rushed
                  at the start compared to the 2003 series, but i don't believe it misses out any important points, it just increases the pace of the series. Every episode has its own importance and plot progression which means that there is never a feeling of bore or plot diversion. 
The characters are well developed and there are interesting links between certain characters. Ling and May are both competitors and comrades, reaching for the same goal for the same reason. The characters that are introduced in the series have very interesting and varying backgrounds from; a foreign prince to a dwarf in a flask. The way the characters change through the series adds to the overall quality, an example could include Greed, who showed little compassion and trust in his comrades at the start but thanked them for their companionship ,seconds before his demise.
The aesthetics are top-notch and everything flows very well, with the action scenes being a highlight of the series. The OST used in the series is decent but i don't believe it reaches the same heights as the 2003 series. 
Overall, i believe that Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an extremely enjoyable series that boasts an intriguing set of characters with a gripping plot. I highly recommend the series to all, due to its action, romance and plot twists.",10
"
                For starters, my main point is being stated on a comparison with the original FMA. although several points are being shared, the ending is completely different, so although a good point would be to state that they are completely separate anime, I cant simply accept that, although a convoluted explanation will have to placate this review, there is no denying the concatenation between the original FMA and this one. 
Secondly, I must state that although anime are animation, I animation quite secondary on anime, this is chiefly due to animation being the guise of the plot and story, although it takes part of the story
                  it is secondary when the plot is put in perspective, I understand that this anime is one in which animation takes up a big role, due to the alchemist side and action side of it, I simply find the plot way more important, although I accept it is jostling with the art.
Heretofore I have explained the reason of the following statements: The series felt like a complete pandemonium. I, impressively saw the original FMA in one sitting, completely loosing track of time, and seeing it world unravel fastly, yet after seeing it I looked up reviews, as if the other FMA was the same thing but with better animation, and finding it was not and most reviews pointing out it was better than the first, I came up to it with maybe too much hype, as when I compared it with the first I simply felt it was not coherent, and worse.  
I must accept it is a good series, but I found the von hohenheim parts, and his relation with Dante and Dante's role too, as part of the plot way worse. I am giving the series a 5 because I cant simply stop comparing it with the original one. now, the original one in my opinion is not too great either, but I do like it quite a bit, yet I find the narrative pace on FMAB quite strange, like a smell you cant say is bad but still its strange so you cant say you like it, like entering a different home from yours. and in my opinion, I find some plot convenience assest here and there (-cough- Xing -cough-). 
this convoluted explanation can only seem to explain that, due to comparation with the original FMA, I didnt like the series and felt almost forced to see it with expectations that it would become better after having seen the original FMA. therefore, I only really liked the Art and Sound, making it quite dissapointing against the original FMA.",5
"
                (SPOILER FREE)
Wow, just wow. This might be the best anime ive ever seen. 
Story 10: The story is memorable, sad and amazing. Its a tale about two boys and their quest to retrieve a body. Doesnt sound like much at first but after you have seen this anime you will have your mind blown. The adventure they go on is long, sad and amazing. And the science behind ""Alchemy"" which is basically the magic in the serie, is beliavable and memorable. Never did i find the story dull or uninteresting, i was always on the edge of my seat.The fight scenes are also very well
                  made and epic. All i can say is that its one of a kind.
Art 9: The animation is beautifull and flowing.The fight scenes look beautifull and real. Its amazingly well done. And never in the series does the animation lack (As with many other animes) The character designs are also unique and all characters have their own style and look. The reason i did not give it a 9 is beacuse it didnt really have a distinct art style like Death note for example. Maybe its just me but i think that a very different and unique art style is more fun. 
Sound 9: The voice acting on the dub is probably the best i have ever seen. It suits the character perfectly and never did i find the voices out of place. (I watched it dubbed cuz the dub was so amazing) And Ed Blaylock does an AMAZING job as King Bradley. I didnt find the music THAT special but its defiently not bad.
Character 10: The characters are fantastic. They always have a REASON to do what they do. They are, as i said, memorable and unique. Every character has an interesting backstory, especially the main characters. Edward Elric (One of the main characters) is funny but at the same time has had a rough past. He is interesting, deep and has many sides too him. Everything a good anime character should have. And the other main character Alfphonse Elric is just as amazing. He is younger than Ed but is maybe more mature xd. The villains are also very very well made. They are menacing, truly evil and their design of them is dreadfull and badass. I cant say much more without spoiling but ALL the characters are fantastic and have depth and are never one sided. 
Enjoyment 10: I very much enjoyed it. It was always fun to watch and never a letdown. Its easy to watch, and never confusing. Its just really enjoyable. And i cant see why anyone would not enjoy it. 
Overall 10: Ultimately, its one of the best animes ever made. The story is gripping, the characters amazing. Its jut everything you would want from a great anime. Its a must watch for anyone who likes anime, doesnt matter if they are young, old or new to anime or maybe a anime veteran. I mean, after all its ranked number one on this site XD",10
"
                This anime is, truly, a masterpiece in all ways. My favorite anime of all time.
Here is why.
First of all, character development. You can CLEARLY see ALL of the characters, including ALL of the side characters, develop. In the ending of this anime, the fates of almost ALL of the characters, even side characters, are told to you. The anime is complete, in every single way. 
Every character has a purpose. There is no dillydallying, no characters put in to just hand Ed and Al a piece of information and then disappear for the rest of the series, gone to who knows where. This happens in
                  most animes, but not here. Every character, even the side characters, and EXTREMELY important. If not in the story, then they find some way to enter the hearts of us, whether through connections with other characters who care about them, or whatever else. 
There is a perfect balance of comedy and seriousness, sadness and joy, and all other opposites. Character's background stories are executed perfectly, in the right times in the right moments in the right ways.
In the first, let's say... 10 episodes of the anime, (especially first episode), you may find yourself being a LITTLE bit bored, and like ""ughh this is like any other anime"" but TRUST ME, right after 10-15 episodes it gets to an awesome thing
bye",10
"
                There isn't much I can say about this series that hasn't already been said.
However, when I started watching the original series, someone asked me if I planned on watching Brotherhood. I said I wasn't sure. They told me, ""If you like fullmetal Alchemist, you'll LOVE Brotherhood,"" and they were right.
Brotherhood has much more humour than the original series. While this draws some attention away from the main plot, it allows for extra character development and keeps the story from becoming too overwhelmingly dark.
If you didn't like the original Fullmetal Alchemist, you will like this version. If you did like it, then get a move on
                  and start watching this. Without a doubt it will end up on your list of favourites.",10
"
                It doesn't matter if it's a book, a television show, a game, or an anime: It is a very rare day where I have to look for something to say negatively when reviewing. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one such piece.
Story: 10
FMA:B, like it's predecessor, starts off as if it would be a semi-typical shounen; however, it quickly becomes much deeper and more involved until a huge plot is unveiled. With enough angst to make the characters deeper, but not cliche, and enough romance to add a softer side, the story is perfectly balanced and well-thought-out.
Art: 10
I personally adore the art style. Not only is it
                  consistent, there are very few animation errors. Also, as a bonus, you can see the characters (Ed in particular) age as the story continues.
Sound: 9
It gets the job done, and highlights the points of light-heartedness and of drama. I only give this a 9 due to the lack of ""Bratja,"" which was a highlight of FMA. I missed it.
Character: 10
I absolutely fell in love with the characters. Even the villains were likeable. The Elric Brothers had an amazing dynamic. The more passionate and hot-headed Ed was well-countered by the easy-going and compassionate Al. Even the side characters had more than one dimension.
Enjoyment: 10
I don't think I went a day without watching FMA:B while watching it for the first time. I just couldn't walk away. To me, this is the ultimate in enjoyment.
Overall: 10",10
"
                So my initial expectations for this anime were pretty low because of the first ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" series. I dropped it because it did not seem to be going anywhere and i honestly did not find it very entertaining. FMA Brotherhood however completely changed my views on this series.
Art 9/10
I personally did not prefer the art style for the characters in this anime, but the animation/backgrounds and everything else were very good. It was nothing too over the top but the art was still better than the first FMA's so its all good.
Story 10/10
I dropped the first FMA at around episode 20 because it did not
                  seem like the story was getting anywhere. There were several episodes that felt like fillers and could have been removed without seriously harming the series. FMA Brotherhood removed those episodes and therefore was able to add more content (although it did feel a bit rushed at times). The whole story was still told in a way that had me hooked and wanting more. Surprising twists occurred in almost every episode, and everything was neatly explained by the time the series ended. I rarely feel sad to see a series end when theirs still 14 episodes left but i did for this series. Everything was built up so well that i know that the series would end with a bang, but there will be no more after that.
Sound 10/10
I had not really paid that much attention to the OST in FMA Brotherhood. That is not to say it was bad though, i know they were really good. The openings stuck out too me more though. All 5 of them were amazing. The last one especially stuck out to me because the sad tone to the music and everything going on made it apparent to me that i was nearing the end of this amazing series. It almost brings a tear to my eye every time i listen to it.
Character 10/10:
The character development in this show was superb. The two main characters, Ed and Al, had distinctive personalities that they stuck with and made them very likable. All of the other characters, even if they only had minor roles, were very likable as well. Most of them were able to change after meeting Ed and Al, and it was enjoyable to see them learn and grow as the series progressed.
Enjoyment 10/10
You really can't hate on this anime. It has everything from action to comedy and even a tad bit of romance here and there. The story gets told fluently and there is little to no filler episodes. Most all the characters get their past shown or explained so we can understand them more and grow to like them. To top all this off, the animation and music were awesome as well. If you have not checked this anime out yet then you defiantly need to ASAP.",10
"
                An amazing show with a fine balance of action and storytelling. No this is not a show about a 16 year old boy with 6 girls in love with him, It is a story rich shounen with amazing characters, character development, soundtrack, fight scenes. There will be characters you fall in love with and some you loathe and OH MY GOD are the openings/endings good. I honestly cried my eyes out at the end and I'm sure you will too!
The DUB in english is the best so far and if that is your native language then PLEASE do as you wont waste you time reading
                  the subtitles like I usually do so you can appreciate how much of a FLAWLESS MASTERPIECE this show is!
Please watch this show! - Mayhem",10
"
                I have watched very few anime, and I would have to say that this may be one of the best I have seen so far. But though I may have liked it, it does have it's flaws. The story was pretty great, it explained the science of the world very throughly, making it seem very believable. 
It had its moments of fun, but a lot of it was misplaced, the humor was placed in times that it was not needed. For example, there was Izumi's.... disability, of her constantly spitting up blood after overworking herself. In Brotherhood, they passed that problem to be more comedic,
                  not much of a serious problem, as for depicting it in FMA 2003, it legitimately made me scared, whenever that happened, and I feel as if the original writers showed the pain that came with her sacrifice.
I feel as if the character development was phenomenal, it made me love the characters more than I did in the original. Especially Scar's transfer from him switching from killing state alchemists to working with them, with inspiration to change the military's view on the Ishvalans.
The ending was very... very... I don't know how to describe it, but it made me happy to see how things turned out. But upon seeing the ending, it left me feeling very empty, hoping that something could happen next. If Ms. Arakawa had intended on us feeling this empty after finishing FullMetal, she sure as hell succeeded.Crafting an ending that ends the story entirely, but still leaves you wanting more is not something that many writers can do. I hope my opinion can change after watching a bit more anime, so I can have a bit more of a stern attitude to review this.",9
"
when I first watch the anime and everyone love it. 
I found  it  a bit  too mediocre like  Hunter x Hunter 
the story feel outstanding but, the real problem with this anime is to fully focus on the story than making A character development.
the character looks a little generic.Edward looks like a typical protagonist.
Alphonse   is likable
the military can be  typical or dark
but, the biggest problem is the homunculus.
the 7 deadly sin homunculus look too much like all the typical villain organization.
Father is when you fuse griffith, Madara, and Aizen. you get Father but, he's a little wasted in the end.
overall 
it  4.10 for  being  decent but , not quiet  good   to be  the best anime but , unlike you name who suck like you want to sleep then crying .
Your name is 0.10 for  being  the  most boring  movie  of all time  but, FMAB is  4.10 for  being just a good story then  a world  bulding  ,etc.",5
"
                Once in a while a story grabs you and just never lets go. No matter how many times I watch this story it never loses any of it's flare. I wouldn't call it a remake of the first anime series, that's not the case, it's just a better adaptation of the manga series than the first attempt that was made. That said, this is gem, a must-see, a nearly perfect diamond of a series.
This imagining of Fullmetal Alchemist does start with a ""filler"" episode, but not to a fault. You are immediately immersed into an exciting world that is filled with the magic of alchemy.
                  Alchemy is explained as a science but presented in such a beautifully magical way. There are so many rich characters and such a deep plotline that even the 64 episode run feels short. 
The story follows the Elric brothers through their emotional journey as they try to find a way to undo the self inflicted tragedy brought on by the grief of losing a loved one. While walking the thin line of morality with human transfiguration they stumble upon a dark secret that is ripping their country apart. Many questions are raised, and many questions are answered along the way. Most answers lead to more questions. This series is always thought provoking and morally stimulating. Humanity is tested, and so are the bonds that they form with others along the way.
DO NOT MISS THIS ANIME. This is one of the best there is, and probably ever will be.",10
"
                7 years late, but I finally finished the entire series! Watched it long ago on TV and know the story but never ALL the episodes until now haha. 
Anyway, rather than a part by part review, this is more of just my thoughts on the series (without giving away spoilers). I wouldn't go as far as to call it a masterpiece, but it is a very solid series. 
What I find most interesting is how the paced the story perfectly and the way the plot makes use of science (alchemy), religion, cultural history, the effects of war, human sins and the bonds of family. While
                  many other series uses these too, in my opinion its rare for this amount to blend so well without making a mess, just touching the surface of certain aspects or rushing the plot.
Also, I find that there is a sense of reality even within this fictional world as it isn't always up to the two main characters to save the day. Characters from different backgrounds have their chance to shine, such as the childhood friend who has to stand by the sidelines, the few supporting soldiers, foreigners from neighboring countries, or even the wives & civilians. This allows us to know their story and empathize with most of them. And if I may say so, I think they did a good job showing that everyone is a main character in their own story. Even the villains.
Finally, my favorite subject of the whole series has gotta be how they deal with death though. Loss, pain, moving on, hatred, revenge, forgiving. All were expressed rather well by both main and supporting characters in my opinion. At the end of the day, death is inevitable and we can only learn to accept it and live on.
In summary, I really enjoyed the series. ^_^",9

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The manga Hiromu Arakawa is so deep that deserved an anime adaptation, but the first adaptation: ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" was made almost with the manga. Result, it has a totally different end of the sleeve, in fact the anime ended well before the manga that was published between 2002-2010 since the anime aired between 2003-2004. But it is not bad, in fact it is an amazing anime that long was told it was the best anime ever made to reach 2008, when Arakawa announced that a new anime was being done, the more faithful to the manga. So in 2009 he debuted in
                  Japan, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, but we have to admit that the true strength of FMA was in the West, where the anime is today revered as the best shounen done. Edging out strong contestants as Rurouni Kenshin, Dragon Ball Z, Naruto and Bleach. But he's all that say: No, it is MUCH more than they talk. With a wonderful story, as human characters that you really believe there and an incredible soundtrack, Fullmetal Alchemist is by far the best anime ever made. Perfect",10

                ""You humans think greed is just for money and power! But everyone wants something they don't have."" - Greed
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is probably one of the highest acclaimed animes I've ever seen ever. Though being the later adaptation that stayed true to the manga, I'm confident to say that this series' reputation is well deserved. 
Story: For those of you who haven't tried following FMA manga or the first animation series, the story is about two brothers (Edward and Alphonse Elric) who committed taboo by trying to revive their dead mother using Alchemy. As a result, Ed lost his left leg while Alphonse lost his
                  whole body leaving his soul behind. In an attempt to save Alphonse's soul, Ed then sacrificed his right arm to place his brother's soul on a suit of armor. Together, they decided to do all they can to bring their original bodies back. 
Though the story might seem ordinary, the challenges they encounter to bring their bodies back is beyond beautiful. This series is an intricate weave of reality and fantasy and viewers won't have to worry of dreadful cliches.
Art: The art of this series doesn't show candy eyed characters, pastel hairs, or awe inducing magic filled fight scenes but viewers will sure love the crisp simplicity that is served. There are times when the quality seems to drop a bit but not enough to be such a big deal. One thing to take note of this series is it's ability to produce easy to remember characters (even if almost all of them wears the same outfits ) without the whole color-coding some series follow these days.
Sound: The series showcases five different opening and ending themes throughout, coming from big artists such as Yui, Nico Touches the Walls, Shoko Nakagawa and Scandal. There isn't much need for insert songs and music for the show but when they do, they make sure that the music matches the mood of the scene. Glad t say that there are no disturbing and unneeded sounds as those can be distracting.
Characters: When watching any shows, my main focus is on the characters, no matter how bad the story is,if the characters are interesting enough then it's a yes for me so I am really really pleased the FMA:Br exceeded my expectations. From the very start of the series until the end, no character was wasted. Everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY is essential to the story. The protagonists are really likeable. Ed as the main is not your typical hero, his personality is very well balanced. Same goes for the loveable Al. The supporting characters lives up well to their roles and gives the necessary boosts for the main, all while maintaining their own individuality. The antagonists for me are such delights. I want to spoil so badly, but let me just end this and say that viewer's will probably love everyone in this show. 
Overall . FMA:Br is a must watch. Every factors compliment each other making it truly unforgettable. Viewers won't have to worry that FMA might be a drag because of the rather high episode count. No episode is wasted (that means no fillers for us, YAY!) and at the end, you'd probably be aching for more.",10

                Possibly the greatest anime I've ever seen. No exaggeration, no joke about it. 
In an anime what should be the measuring stick for manga adaptations, FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood left me speechless by the end of episode 63 and also a little downcast when it wrapped up with 64. 
My favorite thing about Brotherhood is simply its plot. I can't go into too much detail here, but the way everything comes together by the final season and how it ties back to most of the characters makes it one of the most complex and wondrous plots I've seen to date. So complex in fact, I'd recommend
                  keeping a notepad with you as you marathon the series (because believe me, you won't be able to just watch one episode and then walk away) and jot down the questions that float to mind because while they will claw at your mind and demand answers, they will all be answered within time. And it's jaw-dropping when some of them do!
As opposed to other animes, Brotherhood introduces over thirty well-rounded and developed faces that stick in your mind and hold traits/personalities that make them both easy to remember and to identify with. From the state military, to the homunculi, to the foreign faces that accompany the Elric brothers on their journey, most of these characters, much like the ones from Fairy Tail, each have their own in-depth backstories, most of which come together in the end, and overall prove that even the supporting cast doesn't always have to be boring. 
I'm not too observant on OST's, but Brotherhood's is not one to be easily discarded. If you have a good memory for background music, more then likely a few of these pieces will be left stuck in your head. Some of its more recurring pieces like ""The 5th Lab"" and ""Dissident's Creed"" are among my favorites and add the ominous tone the scenes paired with them are going for. Not to mention the five openings and closing songs, op 1 ""Again"" makes it as one of the catchiest and most detailed of anime openings I've seen. 
Whether you prefer dub or sub, you can't say that all dubs are bad without giving Brotherhood's a chance. It's Funimation's best work as far as I'm concerned, and each voice actor/actress pours each line from their mouth with the emotion and tone their respective character deserves. Specifically Vic Mignogna, Travis Willingham, Troy Baker and Ed Blaylock knock their respective roles out of the park! 
Compared to the 2003 series, I simply believe Brotherhood surpasses it in every way, due to the fact that for me, an anime is more enjoyable when the anime is traced right from the manga, due to it being the author's intended beginning, middle and end. 
Needless to say again, Brotherhood just blew me away! It's now a huge favorite of mine, and it's a must-see for any anime fan!",10

                To be clear I just thought that this was the an anticipated super sequel or something  for the brilient  original fma but  I was so confused when I started  it . until I realized that it was a reboot that follows  the  manga .  
which was no problem to me ....but god once I finished it I realized this show is  unbearable ....... I cant stand it . it so easy and  simple .....and no dark and personal theme here ...... rather its actually lighter and more shonenish  than i expected .   
The
                  story is weaker than ever (all this talk about the chosen sacrifice to gather all the character together )  .....the character I dont know what happens .. but wasent mustag supposed to be scary and doush ( dont know what that means )  . but I almost puke when he said to move farward when edd was  an all  broken .  and the homonculis are so boring that I am not even terfied  from them as before  neither interested and yaa what are their orgin story ? it so boring   . and the op espeaslly the last one try so hard to give you this feel of a l shounish crap that we are all on this together . wow this is the first time I think of anime being  over rated . 
seriously wish someone told me earlier about the truth of this show . I really tried to like it .... I am not sure if its even good or is it because i watched the original series first .",6
"
                Needless to say, this is the best anime that ever been created so far,
so I'm just going to point out a few things that I think makes it sit on the throne.
-Story : Exceptional, if you find a better story on this genre, please tell me, because I am dying to watch a better anime than this one.
-Alchemy : The characters fight using alchemy, which is science-fiction like. It makes you believe something like that could really be possible one day.
-Brotherhood : The bond between the two brothers is really strong. I realized this only after I watch the show for the second time.
-Wide range
                  of audience : I believe the show has a wide range of audience, I am sure it can be easily enjoyed by people from age 12-30.
Last but not least, if you are someone who study or at least interested in philosophy, I am sure you will find this anime very, VERY interesting.
That's all, I hope this review helps.
Sorry for my bad english.",10

                Personally, I liked the first FullMetal Alchemist series better, and I wasn't too keen on the idea of the anime fallowing the manga.
Story- On anime-planet I rated this a 8.6, but here I an only rate it an eight. Even though it had taken a different direction from the first and switched to manga based instead.. It still kept its interesting and luring capture to it. But it kinda bores me more than the last one. One reason being that by fallowing the manga it just gave itself a major spoiler without really trying. You already know what is coming, and what's going to happen
                  so really that was highly annoying on its own. You have certain parts that felt sped up, you have character's that are different and over show the emotions. Basically the same mask of a summary but with a major spoiler.
Art (or Animation)- A nine. I did enjoy it more so then anything else really. Its better than most animes and has a more lighter feel towards it combined with dark contrasts, monstorious scenes, and slightly good blood. (it didn't look a nearly as pant.)
Sound- Seven. Before anyone yells at me for ranking the sound seven, I do have my reasons. Mostly it is because of the alchemy, emelements, and metal clashing with each other that I noticed something off. If you have normal hearing you wouldn't hear it the first few times, unless you re-watch and listen very closely. Everytime fight scenes happened I could hear something else in the background. It was faint but I could hear it when ever water splashed, fire roared, metal clashed, etc. That was very annoying to know and hear. But the sound did match with its destend target, even though it was slightly off as well.
Characters- On anime-planet I rated this a 7.4 but here of course you have basic rating. There are many differences from these characters compared to the first anime series. Edward's shorter, lighter hair color, his eyes, he was shorter than before and didn't seem all adultish. He over-reacted a bit with sadness and didn't over-react as much when it came to being called short. Alphonse other then annoying voice changes and a slightly brighter tone there really is not difference other then he can use alchemy with just his hands now. Winry--- still annoying to me, she had more reaction which didn't make her so bad but I still see her as an annoying girlie girl with a metal fetish. Roy the same only more pervy. Riza.. I'm glad to say they didn't mess with her much. In other words they were good and somewhat decent. 
My Enjoyable Rating for this- Well I can't say this easily, seeing as I am writing this while still watching but I have to rate it a 5 for now. My enjoyment for this weavers ever so often so its a medicore stances right now.
My Overall Rating for this- On anime-planet it was 8.5, but here I have to give it a plan eight. It was mostly the art, and an interesting plot that helped with the overall rating.",8

                The new improved Full metal alchemist is just exellent ... and also this time they've decided to follow the manga fully ! how great isent that ? in my opinion every series should do the same ... it would make it so much better.
_Story_
Anyways , im sure most of the people are familiar with the story if they've watched the old FMA series. Al and ed are searching for the Philosophers Stone that is said to amplify the powers of an alchemist enormously. The reason for this is because back in the past they performed a taboo for alchemist , human transmutian. They did this
                  in order to try to review their dead mother, but failed and payed the ultimate price.... Al lost his body and Ed lost a arm and a leg. After this accident they both decided to go on a journy ..to look for the Philosophers Stone in order to get their bodys back.
A pretty fair story in my opinion.
_Art_
Not much have changed with  the art , only been slightly improved in my eyes , the colours are better and they have fixed many poor objects that i've seen in the old series. Something that is just great , so it was nice to see they kept the same art style as they did use in the old serie. Same but slightly improved.
_Sound_ 
Sound is fairly ok , OP and EDS are just amazing to watch , it dosent really happen often i watch the OP and eds in an anime... unless its really good! 
Either than that sounds in the episodes and such are ok , its more up to date i'll say , since the old serie was abit old , so it explains why the sound wasent that great compared to this new serie .
_Character_
Characters have improved abit i'd say, Ed is still the one that is getting pumped when u mention the word midg.... etc :p so each time the word ''tiny'' etc comes in his cool is been swiped of the screen and explodes with a anger that is just funny.
Al is still the calmest of the elric brothers , something i like very good. dont really know what else i should write about him , he's calm :) thats all i got really.
Same goes for the rest of the FMA characters , all of them is very similar to the old series , with a few changes of course , they have might been given a small amount of more humor etc . Some are more serious. And also there are slighty more new characters here. The serious and calm ninja from Xing Ling Yao, and his bodyguards , their all great :)
_Enjoyment_
The series are the top of my list at this point , just a wonderfull serie with a good amount of action and humor... its something im looking forward to each week. therefor its getting top score , i cant get enough of it.
_Overall_ 
Overall this is a serie i would like to recommend all fans of FMA to watch , ofc its a must to see this if you did watch the original serie! but also for people that isent familiar with this one , please take ur time to check it out :) In my opinion this is one of the best anime series out to this date.. its just wonderfull..
Anywhoo thats all i have to say about it :) thanks

                Let me say this right of the bat, this is probably my favorite anime I have ever watched. I feel like people say that it is way too standard for people to find this anime the best in the world. I kindly disagree as I believe that many shows that people consider as the best, are considered the best by some others. I think the fan base for the anime is deserved due to how good the series is. The thing is, is that I really dislike when people put 1's as their review just because they have a bias against it. I just want
                  to make sure that these people understand that this show isn't that bad, and it could deserve a 3 or 4 in their books and not a 1. I have watched the original and I can say that it felt short of my expectations, though still a great series to watch. I enjoyed watching most of it, but felt like it was lacking at times.
I really enjoyed this anime due to the good pacing, intruiging story, amazing art at times, the great soundtrack, the complexity and dynamic characters, and the enjoy-ability while watching. This all helped in creating my favorite anime, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"".
story:10
art:9
sound:10

overall:10
Now I'll start with the synopsis of every category:
STORY(10):
The plot in this anime is very well written and thought out. Every episode is connected to the other not by just some small feeble strings, but a much larger system. Though the episodes seemed to be random at first, they still created a fully formed plot from the start of the episode all the way to the end. This was done to practically show the overall journey of the brothers, and their experiences in a very captivating fashion. The pacing of the series was very good as no part really felt stretched out with literally only 1 filler episode in the whole of 64 episodes. This is a very good rate as fillers usually flood shounen. The plot had many sub plots inside it with their separate climax's. The main plot was still a large focus of the series, but if it was just the focus of the main plot, the characters would seem fake as they would just be way too determined. We wouldn't really experience what they did, and we wouldn't understand what they do all the time while traveling to find a way to go back to normal. Though the Elric Brothers are determined to succeed in getting their bodies back, they also put others before themselves which adds to the plot the fact that there is more potential to play with the plot. The plot could be worked on a bit by being a little more focused on the main plot, but otherwise I think it did a perfectly good job making the pacing a very good length. Not many shows can make their pacing amazing, and the one that I think comes extremely close to the greatness of the pacing here is Death Note. Even then, there are some flaws here and there. 
Another good thing about the story is the fact that it is very unique in many different ways, and the only thing similar that I can think of, is the show ""Avatar, the last Airbender"" which also used the elements as weapons, but other than the core idea, everything else was different. The actual rule-set by which the alchemists can go by, is very vague, but adds the element of surprised when you see something and makes you think. The alchemy is based on science and uses scientific elements found in objects. Certain alchemy is performed by taking certain elements of the periodic table, deconstructing them, and creating something brand new. This is a very interesting idea which can create some very interesting things, and opportunities for the show and still be by that rule set. Not many shows have the fortune of doing this as the rule sets are way too stiff, or they can't really account for flexibility. Almost every single person's alchemy can be described by science and the use of elements making the magic system to feel very restraint, though it really isn't.
The story itself was really interesting with a lot of novel ideas which made it always interesting to watch and understand. I felt like the story was unique to so many other shows that the plot really stands out and the story in turn becomes very interesting, and an interesting take on the shounen genre. As the story progressed, so did the watchers making them very serious and much less naive when it came to the anime. This is done through careful planning of the sub plot and showing the large distance Edward Elric had to walk when it came to changing his character and becoming a much better and caring person by the end. I will explain his character changes a bit more in the character section.
Overall, I really enjoyed the story as it had very good pacing, interesting plots, and the magic system. These all form the great story which can be found in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
ART (9):
The art is incredible during most parts. This creates a realistic sensation while watching the show. The characters are drawn in a very professional way. Every frame is detailed and there are many details you could miss the first time you watch a scene. There is never a stagnant scene, but there is always something to keep your attention and make scenes very interesting to watch. Something I didn't really like was the amount of times they purposely gave the characters a comic-styled look. This was done a lot which made it a bit annoying due to the fact that it just got old. Using this technique is perfectly fine, but I just think that there was just a bit of laziness when it came to drawing these scenes. I think this technique is fine only if it is used a couple of times as not to get old. As the story progresses the comedic scenes stop appearing as the story becomes serious and they are doing subtle things to make sure the watcher knows of what to come. This is a type of foreshadowing, which isn't really foreshadowing anything, but is just there to tell the watcher that there is something to come. Otherwise I think the scenery was very pretty and so were the character models showing just how good of artists Studio Bones had hired.
Overall, the art was very pretty almost all of the time, but during the comedic scenes, it went a little overboard.
SOUND(10):
The soundtrack is amazing for this show. From themes like ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" to themes like ""Brothers"" to a theme like ""Anticipation"" to even ""Nightmares"", it gave a variety of different songs, or music to accompany the events giving certain episodes completely new soundtracks that were exclusive to only them. The theme ""Anticipation"" had a very strong use of violin, but it gave way to the other instruments at times. During suspenseful moments, this music would sometimes play giving off somewhat of an ominous feeling to the moment/scene. Also, the use of the violin and flute during the theme, ""Nightmares"" created an even more ominous vibe to the song. These songs are played at the right time creating songs that you don't really notice, and yet you do. What I mean by this is that there is a really good balance when it comes to the actual sound of what is happening in the anime and there is also the sound that is found in the different compositions. This makes the watcher not really notice the compositions until the decide that they want to listen to it, and then they realize how well it blends in with the situation.
Overall, the soundtrack is amazing especially with the good balance of violins with the other instruments. Some of the vocals are very good as well like ""Brothers"". I really enjoyed the soundtrack and when I'm looking for something to listen to without words, I sometimes choose the Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood soundtrack.
CHARACTER(8):
The sheer amount of side characters can seem overwhelming and obviously hard to pull off. The series somehow manages, though with a few problems. I still enjoy all of the characterization that goes into each of the characters and the relatability you feel towards them. Some of the characters are teddy bears, while some of them have so much complexity in them. Every action the characters take has some reason for it. All of their thoughts lead up to that decision as any normal person would go about doing things. If that person has barely any character traits, they won't have that much of a hard time deciding and their motives will be pretty obvious, but in this serious, this is not the case. You never know the real reason for somebody's action, but you can always try and figure it out. Characters like Mustang may seem pretty strict and bad at first, but all that is required is to think about ulterior motives for him and other character traits he keeps in the dark. 
Some of the characters should personally be explored a bit more. These characters usually have a bit of exploration and a few defining character traits, but they aren't explored to the point where we can understand them as human beings. What they could've done to describe and make the characters more realistic is cut off the amount of time that is spent focused on the Elric Brothers by a bit. I just personally think that they are just a bit too laser focused on the brothers and kind of forget about the rest. 
The change in the characters, though is really good, as even the main character goes through a couple of changes in personality going from a naive little boy trying to resurrect his mother for completely selfish reasons, to becoming one of the most well-known alchemists who is always trying to help others and goes out of his way to do so. At first he just helps for fame, but then he genuinely starts to think about helping others even considering revenge as morally wrong. His moral compass changes drastically. Meanwhile, Alphonse is shaken up after some of the incidents that happen and becomes really paranoid. These things helped Al grow as a person and understand much more about life thus changing some of his character traits.
ENJOYMENT(10):
While watching the show, I felt that the scenes were almost never boring and it always interested me to figure out how this will all end. I felt that the art style and the production quality always makes me be amazed at the scenery created by the animators. As well as this, I really liked the plot and it's uniqueness and cleverness. It also made me think about how I could push the magic rules to their limit as I thought about what was explained to me. There are a lot of things to go back to and reflect on during the series. This was truly and incredible watch that I enjoyed start to finish. Some parts were boring though, but it was just a bias against the sub plot on some episodes. The episodes also varied greatly on the amount of substance and things to learn about the main plot. This sometimes caused issues where I felt as though some episodes were kind of useless. Otherwise I fully enjoyed watching it and only noticed these flaws after thinking about the series. The enjoy ability overall was very great and I felt like I was learning about the plot every time.
OVERALL(10):
Overall I really enjoyed this anime, as you can probably tell by my ratings for every category. I think it is a 10/10 overall. This anime may seem like it is really overrated, but I think differently. Personally, something like this is a very good show with only a limited amount of flaws that I can see. The story itself is really thought out and creates realistic characters to accompany it. The weakest link in this anime was probably the characters, but the characters were still amazing and I think anybody who watches the anime can decide on a favorite character and relate to one of them, if they had to. The show is really enjoyable if you like heavy plot in your anime, and a lot of interesting characters. I enjoyed the show, got a little laughs in, maybe cried a bit. I think this is the best show I have watched, I hope everyone who read this enjoys it as well!
Thank you,

                The story of the Elric brothers was told once in 2003 but that verison moved away from the original manga canon. While it was unique, it suffered from a bad ending and many other problems. Years later Studio Bones decided to redo the series, following the original story in a much more faithful way.
Story: Set in a fictional world where Alchemy exists, the Elric brothers attempt to bring their deceased mother back to life by using the forbidden human transmutation. The end result is Ed losing his leg and Alphonse losing his body, forcing Ed to sacrifice his arm to bind Al's soul to a
                  suit of armor. Approached by a Amestrian State Alchemist named Roy Mustang the two join the country of Amestris to become state alchemists in hopes of finding the Philosophers Stone, which they hope will let them get their bodies back. Unknown to the two, and many within the country, a evil group of beings called Homunculus seek to cause havoc on the world and the brothers must stop them.
The story of FMAB is well told and manages to pull a wide cast of characters into the setting and use them all well. No character is useless or pointless, and every character gets a period of time to shine. The story itself keeps you entertained the whole time and rarely ever feels dull. The writing helps sell the the series and it's well paced story keeps you guessing with some great twists.
Art: The animation is done by Studio Bones and it's simply great. The animation captures the effects and mood perfectly and the animation is consistently good. It gets much more fluid as it goes on too, meaning it never dips and only gets better.
Sound: The soungtrack for FMA is brilliant. It combines beautiful music to fit the great visuals with songs like The Intrepid being note worthy tracks. The voice acting is amazing, and the dub is hands down one of the single best dubs ever put on TV. It captures the characters so much better then the 03 verison and the newcomers fit right at home.
Characters: As I said, their honestly well done. The heroes are likable, the villains are interesting and enjoyable and they all stand out. Roy Mustang, Ling Yao, Riza Hawkeye, and the Armstrong siblings are notable examples of strong, developed characters.
 Enjoyment: I'll be brief: I enjoyed every second.
Final Verdict: Please watch this show. It does a good job of telling a story and it's a roller-coaster of fun and emotions.",10

                I'm still not sure what I missed. You would need to be a toxic edgelord to call this series bad, but this series is praised as quite a bit more than ""good"". Do note, however, that I still would highly recommend this series, simply because apparently it has blown countless minds, meaning there's a good chance it will blow yours if you haven't seen it.
For starters, the whole thing obviously looked and sounded beautiful. Just watch any of the openings to get an idea.
One of the things this series is most praised for is its cast. Edward Elric is a particularly beloved character. I didn't
                  really care for him, and I don't understand how Shinji from Evangelion is supposed to be whiny when this kid isn't, but he didn't detract a significant amount from the experience. Supposedly the 2003 anime fleshes out his character more at the start, and this series blitzes through most of what was covered in the original, so maybe that explains his case.
Most of the characters I thought were competent, having been given some depth but not much time to do anything with it. Maybe it's just that there were an insane number of characters. The main exception for me was Mustang; every scene with Mustang was great (except for one that I can think of, but he was more of a background detail in it, and I'll get back to it later). Then there were some characters that were extremely out-of-place and had far too much screen time. May and Yoki come to mind, as well as some of the Chimeras later on.
The classic anime-ism comedic artstyle switch has been criticized plenty already by everyone else, and deservedly so, but it's brief enough to ignore when it does happen. There's one particular exception, though, and it comes early enough that I don't feel bad spoiling it. Wacky sound effects and a merchandise-ready artstyle take over in one particular scene where a woman coughs up blood due to long-lasting internal injuries from an incident that left her infertile, and her husband holds her up gently by her shoulders to comfort her. What's the joke? Is it that she's in terrible pain? Is it that her husband loves her? Is it just bathos for the sake of bathos? Either way, terrible, gross, disrespectful, why. If for some real-life reason you don't want to see something like this made light of in this fashion, you've been warned.
This series is obviously action-heavy, and the action is consistently well choreographed. Still, the fights can sometimes feel devoid of progression. In some cases this is due to one pretty significant element of the lore. In other cases it's just a fight with the same attempted attacks and the same counters repeated continuously (though this is the minority). Overall, though, the action is consistently great. One fight that comes to mind is a fight towards the end of the series involving a swordsman on steroids.
The story is always well-paced and it always flows well, and only really feels aimless for the first 15 or so episodes. There's a heavy mystery element, and at times it seems like the characters are solving life, the universe and everything faster than they should be, but for the most part it's consistently compelling.
You may notice that there's been a caveat on almost every criticism I've given the series thus far. Given the highs of the series and the production quality, I don't think any of these things could drag the score below a 9 for me without a major flaw, so what does? Finally, spoilers for the end of the series are unavoidable. If you do not wish to read spoilers, please refer to the third sentence of this review.
The ending was a big letdown for me. Not the third act itself, which was an impressive juggling act that is justly praised as such, nor the actual final moments of the series, which left on a satisfying note. Everything from when Father brought everyone down to his basement to the last scene at the gate was a blur.
First of all, in terms of writing, Father was a bad villain in a series filled with excellent villains, and him becoming the main focus at the end was just plain unpleasant for me. Yes, he had motivation, but if a character's motivation exists in four lines out of a 64-episode series in which he's the main villain and the only way his motivation manifests is ""muahaha I'm going to eat the world"", he doesn't have motivation.
Second of all, Father was also a bad villain superficially. Sure, there's the whole thing about how he sucked out his own personality to make the Homonculi, but then he could've at least been an intimidating monolith. Instead he was a mumbling old man.
Third of all, the battle against him accentuated my previous criticisms of the action to an extreme. ""Sir, we're shooting everything at him, but it's not doing anything!"" ""Well, private, shoot at him more!"" ""Wait, why didn't I think of that earlier?! Brilliant idea, sir!"" It felt insulting that a battle against a being that could drink people's souls from a distance ended in a fistfight.
Lastly, not as big a point as the three above, but the way that Al was saved felt like a cop-out. In a story so focused on everything coming at a price, you can bring your brother back into existence, but you'll need to occasionally do physical labor for the rest of your life. I felt the same way about how Mustang and Havoc were healed, but not as much.
The result is a giant pile of suspension of disbelief. Enjoyable only because it's flashy and it involves the cast.
Overall, I see why people like it, but not why they love it. One word that I keep seeing is ""epic""; is it because of the scale, then? Is it because I didn't watch the 2003 version first, and can't fully appreciate the characters because of it? I'm still unsure.",8

                Fullmetal Alchemist AND Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood Review (NO SPOILERS)
There are some shows that when people find out I haven't seen them, they go nuts. There are a lot of shows that are so legendary, so fantastical, have made such a huge impact on the world that we live in, that it would be considered a crime to not watch it. 2015 was a pretty amazing year for me, in terms of the anime I watched. I knocked out some pretty big titles during that year. One of them being the 2003-2004 adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist. And, to sum up my enjoyment of that show in
                  one sentence, I'll just say this. I WATCHED ALL 51 EPISODES IN JUST 2 DAYS. Ya. 
I cannot believe that it took me that long to watch this show. But despite how ridiculously quick I fell in love with this show, I didn't wanna immediately jump into the 2009 adaptation known as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I wanted to take some time, so that I can watch Brotherhood with a fresh mind and relive the memories of the show I loved so much. Brotherhood is 64 episodes long. And I finished it in 1 week. So if you want my short and sweet opinion on these shows, I'll just say it right here. Fullmetal Alchemist AND Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood are some of the greatest anime, no, some of the greatest worlds, characters, stories and overall greatest experiences I have ever had in my entire life. And yes, I think that for both of them. 
For the longest time, I was hesitant to start watching Fullmetal Alchemist because I was a bit confused on the whole original VS Brotherhood thing. For those who aren't aware, when the original Fullmetal Alchemist was being created, the anime actually caught up to where the manga was. And instead of waiting for the manga to get finished, the manga creator gave the animation company permission to go on and create their own version of the story, without any source material to go off of. A little after episode 25 in the original Fullmetal Alchemist, the story branches out in a direction created entirely by the production company, Bones. A lot of people weren't too pleased about this, and by popular demand, Fullmetal Alchemist was brought back in 2009 with a new anime called Brotherhood. For the first 13 episodes of Brotherhood, they pretty much recap the first 25 episodes of the original anime in half the time. Episodes 14 and onward, are all new material, completely based on the story of the manga. 
So when I was trying to get into this franchise, and I asked people which version I should watch, whether it be the original, Brotherhood, or both, I NEVER heard a single person recommend watching both of them. On top of that, I never heard a single person even like both of them. They would always either say that the original is amazing and Brotherhood is awful, or vice versa. Well, I went ahead and watched both of them. I watched them a year apart from one another, to keep a fresh mind and opinion on them both. And you wanna know what I think. I 100% believe that it would be an ABSOLUTE CRIME to only watch one of them! Both Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood are absolute masterpieces in their own individual ways. Not only do i recommend this show to everyone, but I cannot in good conscience recommend you only watch one of them, and not the other. So let's go over why that is. Also, for the sake of simplifying things, from here on out, I will refer to the original 2003 anime as FMA, and I will refer to the 2009 anime as Brotherhood.
So. Why do I recommend you watch both? The main reason for that is the pacing. As far as I'm aware, FMA was originally intended to follow the manga's story, from beginning to end. The only reason they didn't, was because they caught up to the manga, before it was finished. But because they had planned to follow the manga, those first 25 episodes of FMA are REALLY spot on and well done. The pacing is perfect, going slow enough to fill the world with so many fantastical elements and to enrich the characters and their personalities. But at the same time, this isn't a multi hundred episode anime like One Piece. So stuff actually gets accomplished, each episode. Which is really good. FMA's first half does its job perfectly. It tells the story at a perfect pace, while also adding in some filler episodes to just further develop this already spectacular universe. Brotherhood, on the other hand, doesn't do this as well.
Like I said, Brotherhood covers the entire first half of FMA in half of the episode amount. So stuff is really rushed and some stuff outright gets taken out. On top of that, the half way point of FMA is where one of the biggest plot twists of the entire series gets revealed. In Brotherhood, this plot twist gets revealed IN EPISODE 1! I am not kidding. I know Brotherhood was made for the people who had already seen FMA, and that's why the first 13 episodes are so rushed in the first place. But if you're watching Brotherhood as your first introduction to anything Fullmetal Alchemist, it makes a lot less of an impact when something that big gets revealed in episode 1, as opposed to halfway through the series. Brotherhood also leaves some questions left unanswered, if it's the only Fullmetal Alchemist thing you decide to watch. Stuff like how certain characters got connected to each other, how certain characters got to certain locations, why certain events are taking place, etc. Keep in mind, this is not problem if you've watched FMA beforehand. But if you're only watching Brotherhood, it can get a little confusing.
So I recommend you watch both. And I VERY much recommend you watch FMA before Brotherhood. For two reasons. One, because, like I said, FMA does a MUCH better job at introducing the world and characters and has much better pacing for the first half than Brotherhood. And two, because it's genuinely really interesting to see these two different storylines. The two are VERY different from each other. And I am honestly very glad I wound up watching both. You may feel a bit overwhelmed and confused with all I'm saying, but trust me. I was confused, going into it, as well. I had a very hard time understanding what everyone meant when they said that the two shows have completely different story paths. It became SOOOOO much simpler when I just went and watched it. And in the end, I got one series with two shows that were had completely different outcomes and both were VERY incredible to watch, from beginning to end. If you outright refuse to watch both, if you demand that you only watch the episodes that are based off the manga, then here's what you should do. Watch episodes 1-28 of FMA. And then continue to watch episodes 13-64 of Brotherhood. That will give you the most complete, and enjoyable experience of Fullmetal Alchemist's original story.
But like I said, I still 100% recommend you watch both shows, in their entirety. And that's not exactly a difficult or annoying thing to do. First off, both shows are finished now. You don't have to wait for one episode a week, you can watch as much as you want, on your own time. And on top of that, you don't have to watch both shows, back to back. In fact, I encourage you to take a few weeks, months, or even wait a year after watching FMA, before you start Brotherhood. And again, you CAN do that, no problem. Both shows are entirely complete and released. So you can watch them as quickly or as slowly as you want. And besides, if you watch both shows, you just get to watch more Fullmetal Alchemist. And more Fullmetal Alchemist is a GOOD thing. The only other thing I can tell you, before going to watch both of them, is tell you a bit about the movies. Both FMA and Brotherhood have one movie, each. FMA's movie is actually a finale to the entire show and is the closing act on Bones' ending. So that is an outright requirement to watch, immediately after finishing FMA. Brotherhood has a movie which is pretty much a non-canon side story. It's honestly not the greatest thing in the world and you won't miss out on anything by skipping it. But now that I've given my reasons on what I like about both shows and why you should watch both shows, lets get into the nitty-gritty of what makes Fullmetal Alchemist so great.
So where do I even begin? Fullmetal Alchemist has one of the most engaging stories that I've experienced in a LONG time. It's really incredible, the things this show was willing to do, and able to pull off so masterfully. It's really something you need to see for yourself to believe. I cannot stress enough how confident I am that you'll love it. Something I'm really happy about is that I wan't spoiled about ANYTHING, regarding these shows. I knew about the split story paths and I may have seen a picture of the show's main protagonist, here and there. But other than that, I knew literally NOTHING, going into it. And I am SOOOO happy about that! That's why I wanted to keep this review as spoiler free as possible, because this show was just so incredibly powerful and surprising, every step of the way. Even in things that you think everyone in the world knows about at this point. I didn't know about it. And I am so glad that I got to experience every bit of it, in the show, and not from just general knowledge you can't avoid, by simply being in the industry.
The characters are absolutely perfect. Every single one of them. There's seriously not a single character in either show that I didn't like. Such a diverse cast that you get attached to VERY quickly. You love seeing them be themselves. You cry when one of them is crying or suffering. You feel genuine anger when a villain gets their way. This show does an amazing job at developing its entire cast, and I would honestly rank it up as having just as great and diverse of a cast as the entirety of One Piece. The animation for FMA is pretty much at the top of its class, for the year it was created in. It's certainly not anything mind blowing, nowadays, but it's most definitely nothing I would consider bad. Transitioning over to Brotherhood, you're blown away at just how beautiful the world has been recreated. It's such a great feeling to see a show you love get remastered like this. And so well, on top of it. 
As for the classic sub vs dub debate, both of them are really spectacular. However, like Cowboy Bebop and Baccano, I believe Fullmetal Alchemist is one of those shows that sorta needs to be watched in English. The characters and world are just much more well suited in the english language, in my opinion. The only thing I'll warn you of, however is that some voice actors get switched between FMA and Brotherhood. The most/least critical one being Alphonse. And I say most/least because you'd think him getting his voice actor switched would be a big deal, but in all honestly, you probably wouldn't of noticed that they were different, if I hadn't just brought it up, right now. In FMA, Alphonse was voiced by a young boy who was roughly the same age as the character. But when Brotherhood came around, five years later, Al's original voice actor kinda went through puberty and wasn't able to voice Alphonse, anymore. So they had to get a new voice actor for him, and I seriously cannot believe how spot on his replacement voice actor was. It's even more impressive when you find out that his replacement voice actor had zero knowledge of anything Fullmetal Alchemist and also had never even seen the original dub, before dubbing Brotherhood. And she still nailed it perfectly. So that one isn't really a problem. There are 1 or 2 other characters who get different voice actors in Brotherhood, and it might be a bit bothersome to you if you watch Brotherhood immediately after FMA. But for me, it was no problem at all, and I actually kinda preferred the new voice actors for all the characters that had them. So ya, if you generally don't watch dubs, I can promise you that this is a show that is pretty much in complete agreement on being one of the best dubs out there. The Japanese is great, too (And no, I'm not just saying that because Alphonse is voiced by Iori from The iDOLM@STER). But like I said, Fullmetal Alchemist is just much more suited to an english speaking cast.
And of course, the music is amazing. So many memorable tracks that stick with you and do a perfect job at adding to the emotion of every scene. The only music I wasn't too crazy about were the show's openings. Like most long anime series, they switch out the opening theme song every 15 or so episodes. FMA has 4 different opening and ending themes, while Brotherhood has 5. And honestly, I only really liked one opening from both of them. For FMA, I really only like the first opening theme song. I always listened to it and enjoyed it, but I only ever watched and listened to the other openings once. As for the endings, I didn't like either of them, and skipped them after the first viewing. For Brotherhood, I at least like the first ending theme. I like it a lot, actually. It's one of the few ending themes that I never skipped. But for the rest of them, I always skipped them. As for openings, while I guess I can say that they were better than FMA's openings, but I still only liked to listen to Brotherhood's first opening. But that one opening! Let me tell you, that was one of the best stinkin openings I have ever heard in any anime I've ever seen! Visually and musically, it was phenomenal! I listened to that song like 100 times before watching Brotherhood. And I'm still listening to it like crazy, right now. In short, both FMA and Brotherhood have fantastic background music, but I feel that only the first opening of each show are deserving of being attached to this legendary show.
Man... as you can tell, i cannot praise this show enough. I seriously can't comprehend how so many people are completely one sided with which version of Fullmetal Alchemist they like. For me, I like FMA's first half, but prefer Brotherhood's second half. Ya, I like the original manga story more than Bones' story. But I still don't think FMA is bad, in the slightest. For me, it was a really interesting experience, seeing how vastly different the two of them were. And I am so glad I watched them both. If FMA 2003 was the only Fullmetal Alchemist material that existed in the world, I would be completely happy with that. And I feel everyone else would be, too. But when I got to see Brotherhood, it was so exciting getting to see all the characters I loved again, but seeing them on a completely different pathway than I had seen them go, beforehand. The entire story changes. The entire outcome changes. People's goals are different. Different people are good. Different people are bad. Different people live. Different people die. Everything you previously knew about Fullmetal Alchemist gets completely turned around and gives you another exciting show that tops the original one, that was already so stinkin good!
I absolutely loved them both. They were absolute masterpieces. I can't believe it took me this long to actually see them. As of now, there are 3 anime series that I believe to be a requirement for everyone to watch, at some point in the life. There's The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Cowboy Bebop, and Fullmetal Alchemist. I promise you you'll love it. I'm honestly not sure how much I love it, to be honest. Part of me was seriously tempted to let it dethrone One Piece as my favorite anime of all time. I think One Piece is still number one for me, but MAN Fullmetal Alchemist comes so stinkin close! My top 5 favorite anime series (One Piece, Haruhi, Clannad, AnoHana, and FMA + Brotherhood) are all kinda tied, to be honest. I seriously can't put them in a specific order of which ones I enjoyed the most. Maybe one day. But for now, I'll just leave it at this. Fullmetal Alchemist is an absolute masterpiece from beginning to end. Both versions have their worth, and both should be experienced by everyone. If you still haven't seen these shows yet, then I am VERY excited for you. Go out and experience one of the greatest stories this world has to tell.
Fullmetal Alchemist AND Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood BOTH get a score of 10/10.",10

                Since my original review got deleted as it was considered as a rant.
So ye... 
First, the pacing of the story is incredibly slow. There's a lot to the story, and it's very intriguing. The story itself is interesting and has a lot of potential, but it's bogged down by the frustrating pace. More than half the time I find myself just plain bored. 
The characters are only mildly interesting. I cannot stand the amount of little kids in this show.Whenever there's action or drama, the tension is ruined by the irritating attempts at humor. The characters make faces and exaggerate. It completely drops me out
                  of the moment. The lack of interesting characters, the slow pace, the story not taking itself seriously during action or drama scenes, and the little kids make it very hard to like this show.",5
"
                One of the best anime ever created!!! Everything is awesome, but I want to highlight the characters and the plot. Are you searching for an anime with amazing characters and an awesome plot? So you need to see this anime! In my entire life I've never seen a story that I loved all the characters, even the bad guys! If you are searching for an anime with characters that you're gonna love, you MUST SEE FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST: BROTHERHOOD!!! Now the plot..... well is fu***** amazing too. It's so good that I don't have words to describe how awesome it is. So in my opinion, this
                  anime is one of the shows that must be in your list of ""animes that I want to see"".",10
"
                In general it is an excellent series, but it is by no means ""the best series ever created""
The characters are very simple, the plot is predictable, and the art design is very ordinary. The argument seems poor to me and the characters do not grow, they do not have a significant abance, it is all flat. More problems, the moments of suspense are incredibly disappointing and I despair that they add comedy to serious moments, it is totally anticlimactic. Story 6, Art 6, Sound 6, Enjoy 4.
When I remember the series everything seems more perfect as if nostalgia fixed its defects, and that is the
                  big problem. In spite of everything, I recommend this series, it is not that bad, but for me it is a 3/10",3
"
                Some minor spoilers might be present in the following review:
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is awesome!!! I loved the 2003 FMA, but as this one follows the manga more accurately, there are lots more moments that I enjoyed (e.g. EdxWin moments)...
The art is beautiful (as usual, Bones did a GREAT job)...however...I prefer some facial/expression details in the 2003 series more...
As for the music and sound effects...personally I am still overwhelmed by the gorgeous pieces from the 2003 FMA...so I would say they are decent in this one ;)
The storyline is genius and the meanings it brings about are deep- Arakawa is one of the best mangaka =)
                  and there are not plot holes whatsoever! 
You'll enjoy it!!",10

                This review is mainly meant for anyone who watched Fullmetal Alchemist and is either considering Brotherhood, has watched a few episodes and not liked it, or has read one of the negative reviews and was put off.
When I first heard about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I was skeptical. Seeing as the original Fullmetal Alchemist is the first anime I have ever completely watched and is the spark that ignited my obsessive love of anime that I have today, a redo seemed unnecessary to say the least. What could possibly be improved upon a show as fantastic as Fullmetal Alchemist? 
With hesitation and doubt in my heart
                  I started watching the series... and instantly hated it. I won't lie, my first impressions were not only that the show didn't live up to the original, but that it was also an abomination that was dancing on the grave of a greater show. 
I cried, I screamed, I broke things, I didn't do any of the above because I'm exaggerating and not actually crazy, but I was still quite upset. The criticisms bubbled up inside me until I was frustratingly glaring at the TV appalled at such changes as Alphonse's voice actor, or a lack of the opening starting with the classic ""in those days, we really believed..."" lines from Al. 
With each passing episode the insults to Fullmetal Alchemist seemed to grow, episodes that were lovingly crafted in the original series were apparently being lightly brushed on. Moments in the original that got me hooked fell flat in Brotherhood, and I was fed up and ready to write the letter of complaint to end all letters of complaint. But then, my eyes began to open. 
Right around episode 13 where the plot of the two animes separates I started to think that this story might actually be good. As the episodes began to fly I realized that it wasn't good, it was great. After finishing the series I knew without a doubt in my mind that what I had witnessed was my favorite anime of all time. The story of Brotherhood is better than that of the original on so many levels that the two shows truly don't compare. After having my eyes opened I was forced to drop the rating that I gave to the original to an 8 simply because now I knew how much lost potential it had. 
If you enjoyed the story of Fullmetal Alchemist, stick with Brotherhood and I guarantee you that you will not regret it. Not only is the plot and storyline vastly improved upon and more satisfying, the animation, music (in my opinion at least, some disagree), characters, and overall feel is far better. 
Therefore, if you are a true fan of the original series don't give up on Brotherhood after only a few episodes like I was so tempted to do, it is a show that grows into something that will go down in history as one of the greats of animation history and you shouldn't miss out.",10
"
                Franky, the first time I saw the series, I did not like it as much to rate it 9/10. But, I decided to re-watch it and really liked it.
Some of the things I really liked (without spoilers):
1) Every episode is connected and important to the plot. It is quite remarkable that an anime could do this over 64 episodes. 
2) Character development is quite nice. At the end of the series, I could remember the name of several characters and could even briefly describe their personality.
3) Fights are amazing, especially the ones with Wrath.
4) Antagonists are really well-developed. I really liked Wrath, Gluttony, Pride (I
                  was kind of terrified of him) and Kimblee.
5) The main characters (Elric Brothers) are not super-powerful. They do not achieve unreasonable things in their battles just because they are the main characters. They lose whenever the opponent is stronger and the conditions suits the opponent.
6) Emotions are subtly conveyed. Like when Ed feels responsible and helpless whenever his friends around him suffer,  nobody has to say it, you can just look at him and see what he's going through.
Overall, I really enjoyed this. I am giving 9 and not 10 because there were some loose ties at the end, like:
 (SPOILER ALERT)
What exactly is the origin of dwarf in the flask and what's its relationship with Truth? How exactly did the souls that Hohenheim scattered return the souls of Amestris' people. 
And yeah, the jokes about Ed being short were too repetitive.",9
"
                This anime, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB), is an outstanding one. It's a reboot of the other series Fullmetal Alchemist, this is actually the original story, and this one is a whole lot better. It shows more of each characters past and each of their goals that they wish to achieve. And it shows more detail than the other one. Not to mention more side stories and characters. They changed some of the characters personalities and endings (changd it a lot) and I like the way they made it. The fighting scenes are awesome, and openings and endings are catchy. Downside is that I wanted more
                  episodes, even though there's a lot already.
So overall I really like this anime.
If you prefer anime, that has action, a tad of romance, fighting, comedy and tension. Then this one, I recommend to you!",9
"
                An expanse which stretches as far as the eye can see which is filled with meaningless, repugnant, stinky garbage of every kind, a grim atmosphere. And in the midst of all the senseless trash is a single small patch of beautiful flowers, whose area is utterly insignificant to that of the expanse and among those flowers, one of them, the one which puts a smile even on the most hopeless person's face have a name, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. This is the best description I could think of for this benison of an entertainment. This anime is widely regarded as one of the greatest anime of
                  all time and this will make sense once you experience it.
STORY
The story is one the main pillars of this show. It commences with Edward and Alphonse chasing the wanted Isaac McDougal aka The Freezing Alchemist. Isaac learns about the secrets of Amestris' government and endeavours to solve everything solely by himself. While he dies in the process the statements made by him leaves the viewers in a state if intense curiousness which is the perfect initiation for any show. The story is facile to follow but at the same time too complex that once you begin to dwelve deeper into it you will realise that you've only touched the tip of the iceberg. While Brotherhood skips past the early manga chapters assuming people have already watched the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist series, the adaptation was so good that we do not feel it's fast pacing at all. The plot unravels it's mysteries slowly at the right time and the last 15 episodes (The promised day arc) have the best buildup in any anime.
CHARACTERS
The great cast of characters is probably the strongest aspect of this anime. FMAB did something in a short amount time that many shounen anime could not do even with hundreds of episodes. Edward and Alphonse are not your typical ""I have a dream"" main characters. Like many in the show, both of them are products of tragedy and you will easily sympathise with them. Edward Elric's character starts off as a selfish, irate character full of pride, like when we see him getting enraged whenever someone calls him short. As the story moves forward he learns to rely on others rather than shouldering everything on himself and begins to trust and form strong bonds with others. By the end of the show Ed have become a self-accepting, trusting and a placid character. Alphonse Elric starts off as a kind, peaceful and very much dependant on Ed. Even after everything they've gone through, he trusts Ed and deeply cares for him. The literal name of this anime ""Brotherhood"", the profound relation between Elric brothers is explored during a plethora of instances like the entire aftermath of the events at laboratory 5, when Scar attacks them the first time, when Al gets “posessed” by Pride, when Greed abducts Al in Dublith and much more that it does not leave the viewer questioning about the deep connection between the Elric brothers.
Another aspect I love about FMAB is no matter how insignificant or lame you are, you have a significance to the story. It shows that every person plays a role and has a consequentiality. It makes us feel Ed and Al to be a part of the world rather than stars of the show.
Arakawa(the writer of FMA) is not the type of writer to make a character who has lived for hundreds of years a flat one. The lack of discussion about Van Hohenheim on MAL deeply pertubs me. You could even say that FMAB is Hohenheim's story said through the eyes of his sons. He's incredibly nuanced for a character to be properly introduced so far into the story. He loves his family and devotes himself to them, while also being full of culpability about Xerxes. He talks to everyone and gets to know them. He also brought his knowledge to Xing, implying he travelled, helped people and taught them. He has troubles showing his emotions, and he's self aware enough to know he's no genius. He isn't incredibly brilliant or talented but rather everything he is is the fruit of years of work and study. He's a flawed, nuanced character with a lot of growth and without a doubt a great character. When he wanted to die, he lived and when he wanted to live, he died, the irony of it. Scar is a great antihero who was initially an antagonist who uses religion to justify his sins. He’s discriminated against for what race he is, where he came from and that’s something a lot of people can relate too. His chemistry with Winry, a person who would have been completely justified seeking revenge for the deaths of her parents but, instead, chooses to forgive is done very well. The Military major driving force of this anime and has many major players from it. The death of Hughes establishes that no one is safe and takes a deep emotional turn from then. Mustang's character arc is also very well done. FMAB excels in creating many well-developed and interesting female characters. Rather than fanservicing the hell out of them, Arakawa gave them depth in terms of writing. Winry, Riza, Olivier, Izumi, Maria, Mei, all are individuals (not just a ""woman"" archetype) with their own interesting personalities, goals, and skills.
Arakawa did a great job in representing the Homunculus as The Seven Deadly Sins while also perfectly connecting them to Father's desire to become God and hence to the story, giving meaning to their names. The names used also gives a psychological advantage as the viewer automatically assumes the existence of other Homunculus when Lust and Gluttony are introduced early in the show. Lust and Sloth had greater characterisation in 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist anime but they clearly manages to leave a mark of their presence in the Brotherhood too.
Lust and Gluttony make a great duo and made a wonderful job as antagonists in the early episodes. Pride was the first Homunculus to be created by Father. Introduced as the adopted son of King Bradley, his real appearance is based on Father's original form, the Dwarf in the Flask during the time of Xerxes. Sloth is the most uninteresting of all the Homunculi but his importance in digging a gigantic transmutation circle beneath Amestris to be used in turning the country into a Philosopher's Stone is immense. Greed is an extremely well executed anti-hero. As his name literally suggests, he is introduced as a greedy character who will do anything to accomplish his selfish needs. By taking over Ling Yao, Ling helps him to make him understand that what he truly craves for is not money, women or power but simply friendship. His turning of antagonist into an anti hero is truly marvellous and he is a character that everyone can easily root for despite being evil in nature. Envy is probably the most hated antagonist along with Pride in FMAB. He is a selfish and sadistic character who does not have any high ideals. He manipulates those weaker than himself and is constantly trying to play power games with those around him. Envy will constantly use dirty tactics to deceive and gloat all in the attempt to reach his goal that goal being self-affirmation. The feeling of unfairness and foul play, it is a feeling that is what makes this villain so hateable. Envy is jealous of the camaraderie and unity of people when it's temptation to get the others to turn against each other's fails, he is confused and unable to understand why these people would work together despite their backgrounds and history with each other. Envy needs attention, Envy means affirmation but there's no one to give that to envy. When Envy one last time tries to manipulate others as it always does, there's no response no change in emotion no rebuttals no anger in anyone, it is this the enemy seems to fear most, the fear being ignored, a sign of being unworthy, something that is worthless, this realization of jealousy is humiliating to the point where is better to die than to live on. In the end, Envy ends up being a tragic and a great antagonist. King Bradley is not a great personification of the deadly sin that he was named after. He is much less of the classic temperamental anger that may have been expected and much more of a man depicting a cold unrelenting fury dictated by his hatred of humanity and his idea of how people should live their lives. Despite going through life following a path that had been laid out for him from the start, Bradley's Philosophy is one predicated on self-Reliance. He has a true respect for those that rely only on themselves to strive forward towards their ambitions because he can relate and knows how difficult and admirable this is. He has a huge amount of disdain for the concept of a God and he is very anti religious chastising the Ishvalans for over alliance on deism and scorning Scar for his beliefs. He hates that these ideas tend to regress mankind and make them meek and unwilling to act for themselves if God exists. Bradley believes that living for others should not be a concern for a true King. He finds the idea of altruistic sacrifice to be abhorrent and an insult to life itself this is likely why he displays such a respect for exceptional fighters like Mustang, Lan Fan, Fu, and Scar. He has lived a life completely lacking in freedom except for one thing his wife and so he'd used her as a representation of his freedom to choose even if he was just limited to one choice. Humanity gave him a chance to fight with his all against Fierce opponents humanity gave him some fun and entertainment, and most of all humanity gave him choice this is why Bradley considers his life to have been one worth living he died satisfied.
Another interesting aspect of FMAB is that every Homunculus dies in an ironic way.
> Lust, the embodiment of the sin that makes men kneel, dies kneeling to a man.
> Gluttony, the embodiment of greed in food dies getting eaten by Pride.
> Pride gets defeated by a lifeform he considered to be inferior to him.
> Sloth, the symbol of laziness dies due to over exerting himself.
> Greed dies satisfied.
> Envy commits suicide after discovering that he has been envious of the humans.
> Wrath is killed by Scar who has overcome his own wrath.
It is not surprising that a mere human cannot understand Father or to be more accurate, to feel Father as a rather bland character. He strips himself off his seven sins or his human side because of his aspiration to become a literal GOD. This and his appearance being similar to Hohenheim somewhat makes Father an uninteresting/boring character. While at the surface this may seem to be underwhelming considering the big bad of a great show who orders around other more interesting antagonists is boring, there is a lot more to it than seems. One of the philosophical message this story delivers is that one gains stature not by directly removing the sins but by overcoming it, Father took the former, the easier way and becomes bland in the process. The Homunculi Father created is a part of him and Father is a part of them. So while considering the character of Father or more accurately The Dwarf in the Flask, he is all of the homonculi combined. His relationship with the Homunculi is being overshadowed by the blandness of Father which makes people to assume him as a bad antagonist while when you look from a greater perspective, he is not.
ART AND SOUND
The source material and it's adaptation are hardly related to each other than being a plot source. A great source material does not necessarily mean it's adaptation will be as phenomenal, Berserk 2016 for example and vice versa. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood will go down in history as one of the best adaptations in anime history, thanks to great work of Studio Bones. The artstyle is nothing phenomenal but perfectly fine. The art becomes simpler in random comedic moments which does not feel off at all. The top notch voice acting makes us feel than view the show and the music by Akira Senju beautifully fits the anime. Trisha's Lullaby, Lapis Philosophorum, Xing Symphony, Homage to the Alchemist, you name it there were are a lot of memorable soundtracks from this anime that I was listening to even after completing it. All of the 5 openings and endings were nothing short of great.
CONCLUSION
While there does not exist a literally ""perfect"" anime, FMAB is one of the closest ones with very few issues. Like I mentioned earlier Brotherhood skips a few of the early chapters, while this may not affect a person whose first Fullmetal Alchemist experience is FMAB, there is a slight chance this may affect the manga readers or FMA 2003 viewer's experience. There is also a problem of tonal shifts, random comedic moments with lesser animation quality pops up in the midst of a serious situation and there is a slight chance that this may affect the viewer's experience. But the quantity of this shift gets reduced as the show progresses forward. Personally though, these two issues did not affect my experience. 
There are a lot of themes that this anime explores and develops overtime. Tragedy, Loss, hatred, pointlessness of revenge, value of a human soul, embracement of one's humanity, equivalent exchange and much more. I do not believe Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was about it's beautiful story, it's phenomenal characters or astounding music but instead about it's philosophical messages and it's application into real life. The difference in Isaac McDougal and Edward Elric is that the former did not trust anyone, was reckless and tried to solve everything by himself and failed but the latter made good relationship with people, formulated a plan and succeeded in achieving the common goal. The conclusion of Father teaches us an important lesson that one must not aspire to become someone else but stay true to themselves. Science and religion are two clashing subjects of utmost importance to humanity. While the preference depends on individuals, FMAB manages to excellently display the light and dark faces of both sides, signifying that none is superior to the other. For example in the case of Rose, the pathetic side of religion is shown, she is blinded by faith and believes that Father Cornello can successfully bring back her loved one. While in the case of Shou Tucker, the cruel side of science and importance of morality is demonstrated. Equivalent exchange, the very core of this anime have a lot of analogies in real world. In order to gain something we have to sacrifice something of equal value first, this can be money, time, health anything. The value that we place on these things differs, but each is extremely important and can have adverse effects on our lives. If you try to achieve something you may make mistakes. Rather than failures you should view them as lessons, or painful lessons. If you manage to do that and not be afraid to make mistakes and learn from them, than you will reach your goal eventually.
""A lesson without pain is meaningless. For you cannot gain anything without sacrificing something else in return, but once you have overcome it and made it your own...you will gain an irreplaceable Fullmetal Heart""
- Edward Elric/Hiromu Arakawa",10

                Since this is my first review I would try and not put as much spoilers as I could
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, contains 64 episodes and has the genre of action, adventure, drama, fantasy, magic, shounen and military. This anime is rumoured to be one of the most overhyped anime and according to the eyes of various anime viewers, could be even overrated. This lovely anime sits on my anime list with an excellent score of nine since it gives you no fillers at all throughout the whole series and leaves you with a satisfied face after each episode.
FMA Brotherhood starts off with the introduction of Isaac
                  McDougal, the freezing alchemist with the military trying to capture him. This first episode was only shown in the anime and provides you with a satisfying amount of information about the military. The Youswell arc (Which I liked immensely) and the Train Kidnapping arc which were included in the manga sadly didn't get shown in the anime. The anime basically gives you a great starting episode that provides you with comedy, information and action. The ending was also a satisfying one and all plot holes were resolved during the end.
Characters: 9/10
In order for an anime to be good, it would need to require a cast of excellent and interesting characters to examine and that is exactly what this series has given us.
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood follows the story of the main characters Edward and Alphonse Elric. Edward and Alphonse may look like your average shounen 
characters to the eyes of some people but they are actually not. Throughout the series, huge numbers of minor characters are introduced which take a huge impact on the character development of Edward and Alphonse. Talking about character development, most of the minor characters in FMA Brotherhood don't receive a satisfying amount of character development which is one of the elements that this series lacks on. On the other hand, the people who actually do receive immense character development are the most interesting to explore and examine for example my favourite FMA:B character: Scar. One point was lost due to the point that Father wasn't a satisfying enemy and just didn't suit my taste as a villain.
Sound: 8/10
Sound is also another important element that has to implemented correctly for a certain scene to sound good and FMA:B has done quite well on that. Throughout the series, FMA:B delivers to you a 6 excellent openings and a couple of alright endings that you might enjoy (My favourite being op 1). The OSTs also fit to the certain scene they are supposed to be in. Some certain OSTs also sound fantastic and might be a delight to your ears. Character voicing has also been implemented well throughout the whole series. FMA:B has done well on implementing their music and voicing correctly throughout the whole series and has chosen great openings and endings to use.
Animation: 8/10
Excellent animation is required for a anime to shine brightly and this is presented averagely in FMA:B. I really liked the animation details in the landscape and characters but sometimes the animation would just lack out. The original FMA's animation just suited my taste better then FMA:B.
Story: 7/10
An outstanding storyline is what makes a anime run and FMA:B has done averagely on that. The definition of the story could probably be shortened to ""Two brothers try and go find a red rock"" The storyline was bland and uninteresting and just sounded like the average story of a shounen anime (Which is probably one of the reasons why it is). However as the anime moves on this is not the case as the anime undergoes a huge amount of dark turns and plot twists which make the storyline more interesting.
Enjoyment: 9/10
The enjoyment of an anime is what gets people to continue watching it and FMA:B had left me entertained all the time. The comedy scenes, the action scenes and most of the anime just had me entertained most of the time. The excellent characters, sound and animation just made me enjoy the anime more then I thought I would.
Overall, I would suggest this anime out to anyone who hasn't watched it yet since it's has a excellent set of characters, sound and animation and is immensely enjoyable.",9
"
                Normally, when there is a remake most of the story stays the same. Just changing the visuals as in graphics and so, but not for this anime.
Its like the whole story changed, and to be honest the story became much better. Though the core stays the same as in Alphonse and Edward looking to return their bodies, but there are new characters and story line changed contradicting with the old series, maybe following the manga more thoroughly.
Story (8) - the story initially revolves around the Eliric brothers that performed a taboo alchemy ritual to revive their dead mother which resulted in Al's body being lost
                  and Ed's leg and arm being lost. They start a journey to recover their old bodies and end up meeting a lot of interesting people on their long journey. The story blends a great sense of comedy and drama. Practically makes you cry in some places.
Art (7) - the art is defiantly better than in the former series, especially the comedy craft they make the bodies sound and look funny. In my opinion the angry face of their master is Priceless.
Characters (9) the characters are well developed too, there is a story behind each one of them and that story unfold and unravels until the very end of the series. 
Enjoyment (8) - this is a series that will glue your eyes to the screen. Probably make you watch 30 episodes per day. Its truly amusing and has a way of pulling you in real soon. Hence the 8 on its grading.
Overall (9) I found out about this series saying it was a classic, Obviously it is and it is a much watch for every anime fanatic of they haven't watched it yet. 
Thanks for reading and hope you found this usefull",8
"
                This take on the fullmetal alchemist is far Superior than the last iteration of this franchise.
We follow the story of Edward Elric as well as Alphonse Elric, where they have commuted human taboo to resurrect their dead mother. It had gone terrible wrong where the creature they had summed wasn't their mother it was a abomination. After this creature was summed Edward lost his arm as a cost as well as his brother Alphonse, Edward exerts in ""He's my only brother my little brother.take my leg take my heart take anything but give my brother back"" This is how Alphonse was bounded to the armor
                  by a blood seal, As well as that this is how Edward lost his arm and his leg and became a fullmetal alchemist.
From a character development and progression stand point this anime starts out very quick, you are introduced to about a quarter of the characters in the first 8 episodes. When you hit about 20 episodes in nearly every episode will make you question yourself and humanity, as well as hit your soft point and make you cry on the floor like a baby because of how attached you where to a character.
I have read the manga as well I have seen the first iteration of the franchise, If you are just starting to watch amines I would insists you watch this one.",10
"
                To me Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood get a 10 out of 10 across the board.
The story is amazing. It may have started out slow for maybe the first 13 episodes but that was mainly it changing and restating the things from the original fullmetal alchemist. AFter the initial startup though things get intense and the story just gets addicting. And the last 13 episodes are just full of emotion, and made me laugh, cry, cringe and everything in between which is hard for a show to do, much less an anime. Fullmetal Alchemist has the best story i've witnessed to date, in anime.
The art is amazing
                  as well. Done by studio Bones, and looking through their catalog of previous anime, they never fail to impress. The art and special effects are as good as it gets in this modern age.
The sound is great too! Great theme songs! Great Japanese dub! And my all time favorite English dub!!!! There is not one annoying voice in the English dub!!!
The characters are good too! Not one sour one. Maybe a few not so great ones. But way more amazing ones full of emotions that i can relate too.
This is a great anime and you'd be doing yourself a big disservice to never see it. I'd recommend this anime to any wannabe otakus because it has everything that makes anime great!",10
"
                I love this show since I saw it when Full metal alchemist was aired at Canada.
Okay the story was outstanding, I love every minute of it, I love how the story does alchemy reconstructing metal or any thing like making flames by snapping your finger, and only one is not allowed though it comes with a price.
Loved the art. 
The music was awesome and fitted in the role of the scenery.
The main characters was outstanding, I liked their role in the story. Main character are always awesome in their own unique way. 
I really enjoyed this series, but many had to do, what they
                  had to do, nothing can be undone, but just move forward and do what is right.
Overall its was great I gave it a 9.",9

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood Anime Review
Introduction
	Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMAB) is the second adaptation from Fullmetal Alchemist (FMA) Manga and a reboot from the first anime which is rather disappointed because the story is not based on manga and rather absurd. Not like the first FMA, FMAB is full based on manga. FMAB is originally aired on TV in Japan from 5 April 2009 until 4 July 2010 and it has 64 episodes. FMAB getting positive critics and being the second highest rating on My Anime List (the biggest anime community) 9,21 from 80,077 voters (23 June 2012)
Footage of the story
	FMAB is the story about the struggle
                  of two brothers to get a philosopher’s stone, a stone which can grant wish from the owner, for getting their bodies which missed because they broke the Alchemy’s law.	The story starts from their childhood. Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric are two brothers who live peacefully in a village with their parent. One day, their father leaves them without reason. not long after that, their mother is sick and passed away. They want to get back their mother from dead because they are loving their mother so much. So, with the knowledge of alchemy from their father’s books and from their teacher. They try to make a human transmutation which is forbidden to do in the alchemy’s law. They get a havoc after doing human transmutation which is failed. The older brother, Edward, lost his left leg and right hand. The younger brother, Alphonse, lost all of the entire body, but fortunately Edward can attach his soul into a suit of armor. They are regret for what they have done but try to forget and getting a better life. Then, they try to get their missing bodies by getting the philosopher’s stone. They must face Obstacles from Homonculus, a rebel hero, and from the government itself to get the stone. And their journey begins…
Review:
1. Story and Character (10/10)
	The story is very solid, the tempo from each episodes is rather fast but it is enough to explain everything that we need to know without any confusion. The development of the characters is great. Important characters get enough explanation for their background and objectives. Many intrigues and twisted story keeping us difficult to guess the continuation. The story can also play the emotions of the audiences, such as cool action, fresh comedy, tragic scene, and a little of romance.
2. Sound, Music, and Voice (9/10)
The Music are amazing and suit the scenes, like the sound of violin when there are sad scenes and full of passion music when there are action scenes. The opening and ending songs are easy-listening and worth for Japanese music-lover to collect the full version. The dubbers do great job because many of them are the same dubbers from the first anime. They make us who watched the first anime do not need to adapt for the new dubbers’ voice.
3. Graphic (8/10)
	The animation is much better than the first anime adaptation because the time difference of the release is 5 years, so the technology to make effect is better. but it is not very special comparing with other animes in the same year, but The action animation effect is good. Character design is brilliant so you can know the differences of the origin of the people, such as Chinese, Caucasian, and Negro.  
Conclusion
FMAB is one of the best anime that everybody are going to love it.",10
"
                Overrated. This is the one word that comes to my mind when someone says ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"". Overrated doesn't necessarily mean bad and that is the reason that I've rated this a 9. It's a good anime with a nice story to tell but I don't see it for the ""Generational"" ""Once in a lifetime"" or ""Era defining"" anime that many people call it as. I was hyped when I started watching this and since this was rated above Attack on Titan, I naturally expected this to be better than it. Answer: It isn't. This show is not the masterpiece many people make it out
                  to be but rather a pretty normal show with a good story to tell.",9
"
                Fullmetal alchemist Broterhood is an anime that has something for everybody
humor, action, adventure, feels, romance, etc.
This anime is absolutely one of my favorites because of how amazing the story is and how lovable many of the characters are
The only flaw I can imagine is that the pacing of the anime is sometimes slower than it needs to be, but otherwise it's a great show
The Music and sound quality of FMA:B is terrific and very pleasing to my ears and the voice acting of the english dub was spectacular, none of the characters voices seemed annoying or like they didn't fit.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of
                  my top favorite anime.",10
"
                Fullmetal alchemist: brotherhood was one of the best animes I've watched so far.The story was clever en inpredictable, you never knew what was going to happen next!
The characterdevelopement was alse really well made: you get to know every character and their background story, but in a very subtle way.What is so special about this show is that you see the characters growing up,becoming adults,without noticing that.I watched the series twice already and what I noticed was that the personality,looks,attitude of the characters changes.
You will never get bored watching this show, because I found that every episode had the right amount of action to provide that.
I
                  wish I could experience this anime for the first time again, I was so intriged while watching this!
The only thing that bothered me was the style they drew the anime in: the colours were pretty dull...
this was a great show to watch:it definetly deserves to be ranked #1",8
"
                DO NOT watch FMA: Brotherhood without first watching the 2003 adaptation.  The first 13 episodes of Brotherhood are fast paced without drawing the same emotions as the original FMA 03. The show assumes you are familiar with the back stories of the characters and does a very underwhelming job at introducing the Elric Brothers as a characters. This is this shows main drawback. The motives of Edward and Alphonse Elric seem not as valuable as they did in the original. You will have more fun watching the side characters of the show in action then the two leads. Which isn't necessarily a problem but
                  it would have liked to see more impact on their story. While the original series left me emotional in the end, FMA: Brotherhood felt like another DBZ in the last 5-10 episodes which was disappointing. 
Overall the sheer quality and budget of the series shows. The fights definitely are entertaining when they are at appropriate pace. (all but last 10 episodes) With an intriguing plot with an interesting concept creates for a very good anime. I would consider FMA: Brotherhood the king of the Shonen Genre which is why I rate it a 9/10. However, for guys like me who are not fans of Shonens, and prefer emotionally moving stories with more developed characters, then you are better off watching the original FMA. Brotherhood didn't cause me to feel any emotion while watching it. I didn't care about Haughes or Nina when they died. It felt forced. Same with the comedy in this show while its the same as the original, it was much more repetitive and frequent thus becoming annoying and forced. So I would say this show is an 8/10 for people like me. Overall a 9 because its the best in its genre.",9
"
                This is not exactly a review but just an explanation to myself why this anime is a 9.
#1 mistake I made in regards to watching this - I watched it right after Hunter x Hunter... which led me to drop this show 4 times before finally picking it up from episode 12 and watching all the way till the end. 
This anime gets almost everything right. What a stunning ensemble. Each and every side character was amazing. Putting them down in words will diminish how amazing this cast is. Definitely one of the best in anime. Heh, there's a reason why this is #1 on
                  MAL. It's most likely because of this cast.
Here are the 3 things it does wrong,
1 - The Elric brothers could've been written better.
2 - Their dad's abandonment and neglect doesn't really make much sense, although I'm glad he admits he's a shitty father.
3 - The fights had no wow-factor to them. (Again, was expecting something like HxH and Naruto kind of fight scenes). Also a bunch of plot-holes and strong plot-armor.
But anyway, if an anime can make me feel sad for a character who barely got 10 minutes of screen time in Trisha Elric, it has to be pretty darn good.
Episode 27, that cutaway scene into the end credits. Dang.",9
"
                I was reluctant to watch this show as I have not seen either 2003 or read the Manga, which are both highly praised already. The things that makes FMA:B stand out compared to other anime is that it does EVERYTHING excellently. The pacing is amazing. The art style is clean, appealing, and overall great. There are definitely shows with flashier animation and more intricate detail, but FMA:B has so much detail in what it provides that more would be unnecessary. The character development and plot advancement(pacing) is perfect. I had a legitimate connection to most of the cast, even some of the many villains and
                  anti-heros that are present. The OST has a variety of great pieces and isn't overly repetitive. 
Its 64 episodes long, so it'll take a while to finish, but it is addicting. This is truly the best show I've watched to date.",10
"
                Spoiler free:
If you're new to anime go for it, hands down one of the best modern shonen shows out there, and it has a happy ending, you can count happy satisfying endings in shonen with 1 hand and you still have fingers to spare, this anime wastes no time with fillers or unnecessary amount of episodes, and i would rate it at least 6 if it wasn't because of FMA 2003. 
Yeah its a little unfair to compare it with an anime that isn't even the same genre, while brotherhood appeals to the younger ones with a disney-like ending and a lot of flashy shonen
                  moments, FMA 2003 tells a story that involves everyone equally, antagonists are just as important as protagonists, brotherhood doesn't care about his antagonists, they are all just brainless evil puppets, the plot is predictable and even in 64 episodes brotherhood manages to have 1 major character serving no purpose for some reason, I'm talking about ""Scar"" of course, he is the biggest disappointing on the series specially if you consider that chronologically he was the first ""killer"" antagonist in modern anime, imitations that came after him were pathetic, like garou from ""one puch man"", or Stain from ""my hero academia"", FMA 2003 has the best example of the perfect ""killer"" antagonist in the whole anime industry, and brotherhood's version of Scar, can be removed and nobody would even notice, cause he serves no purpose whatsoever.
I could write hundreds of pages about how every single character in brotherhood is at least 10x better developed in less episodes on its 2003 counterpart, but i think, just scar is enough to prove my point.
You learn nothing from brotherhood's ending, its just a plain happy ending.
Awkward comedy, bad characters, who died?, the engravement from Edward's clock, its like the mangaka forgot completely about it, I'm gonna asume she was under a lot of pressure because she had to surpass the 2003 version, but she failed miserably and left us with an ok shonen anime with terrible antagonists and no fillers.",2
"
                FMA Brotherhood is without a doubt the highest quality anime I've seen to date. Not only Within the anime itself, but also in the extra official media like the OST, the OVAs, and some of the dvd extras (like the outtakes from the dub, which continues to be one of the funniest officially made anime videos I've seen). The anime itself is engaging and rewarding, meaning it builds up suspense or mystery in one episode and delivers on it really well in the next. The characters feel really human and one of my favorite things is that they age, not only mentally, but physically as
                  well. It's clear by the end of this series they they are not the same people that the story started with. The world building is great, but because the laws of alchemy aren't known too well many things can be written off as being because of it, which I would say is the shows biggest flaw. The soundtrack is phenomenal and has many recognizable melodies along with masterfully composed tracks to set the mood really well. It also has my favorite anime opening of all time (OP 1).",10
"
                Why I hate this show its the question that you most be answer you and before you kill me, read my revie please, ok, this show is just very slowly, I found development but is too simple, probably the worst of this shows are the battles, man, see the battles again, this is a shonen, but the helpfuls in this show are so stupids, i light save scar, alphonse got a shot that destroy a palace but he is saved, i can find more logic in a isekai show like isekai cheat magician than here, the manga is good but this was awful, 64 episodes
                  of suffering for me, the finale is so anticlimatic, damn, its a good ending for the characters, i respect that but the connectiion beetween that last scenes are so out of context, just why ruined a good manga, i do not gonna say anything about the comedy cause this is very subjective , for me, -1, genga deiyuu show me what is a masterpiece, not this,",1
"
                Aaaah, where do I begin with Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood? i haven't seen the first, and i've only finished watching this one today, literally, but I can't even begin to comprehend how much I've genuinely enjoyed watching this anime.
Story (9/10): The story is brilliant. It revolves around the two brothers, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric, in their journey to get their bodies back (you'll get what I mean when you watch the anime). They meet crazy, hilarious, and sometimes really fucking INFURIATING characters along the way. We, the viewers, learn more about the flaws of their country's military and government, and how fucked up it is during
                  this journey. The story changes from simply wanting to get their bodies back, to saving their nation, and it's amazing. 
Art & Sound (8-10/10): The animation is very good, but it is not outstanding, which is to be expected, but does not make the anime less enjoyable whatsoever. The sounds are outstanding, and they set the mood and dramaticize the scenes. 
Character (10/10): I LOVE THE CHARACTERS. I especially adore both Edward and Alphonse, who both have distinct personalities, but are nonetheless equally lovable. Edward is more outgoing, and is presented to be the more powerful, in terms of alchemy. Alphonse is understanding, forgiving, loving, AND SO FREAKING CUTE. They are both hilarious and you will absolutely grow to love them as much as I do. The supporting characters are outstanding, from the colonels, generals, lieutenants to the civilians, foreigners and homunculi. 
Enjoyment (10/10): You can tell that I love this anime. It made me laugh so hard I nearly peed, and also made me cry so hard that I felt like my heart was about to break and my chest burst. It is an emotional, hilarious, and OUTSTANDING anime that you are sure to love. 
I recommend this anime. Go watch it. Now.",9

                Dont get me wrong This is a Masterpiece But Only One Anime has ever gotten a 10 from ME!!
Story
When I first heard that a new series of Fullmetal Alchemist was to hit our screens in spring 2009, I admit that I approached it with trepidation. I loved the 2002 version, thought it ended well and, after believing the film had ruined it somewhat, I was praying that a second season wouldn’t besmirch the franchise any further. When I learned that this new anime was a re-telling that actually sticks to the manga’s plot, I was suddenly much more interested.
While initially it’s easy to fall into
                  the trap of constantly comparing the first Fullmetal Alchemist with Brotherhood, when it really picks up, those thoughts soon disappear. Although the earlier part of the series speeds ahead at double the pace of 2002 – putting into ten episodes what FMA draws out for twenty-five – the plotline itself is far from hurried. Instead, Brotherhood finds the perfect balance of action-packed instalments with slower sections to develop the narrative. Certainly, the Nina arc in 2002 feels more fully fleshed-out, twice as disturbing, and far more heartbreaking, and yes, in contrast it seems rushed in this new incarnation. So, while I missed that chance to cry like a little girl, in the grand scheme of things that one event becomes much less important than everything else that follows, and it would have been to the detriment of later events had that arc been stretched out any longer.
However, what really gets your knickers wet with excitement is the developing narrative and its accompanying action. The show chops out all of the extraneous fluff (albeit good fluff) that the first series had and not only links together the individual plot threads, but expands its scope to cover more of Amestris’ territory and beyond, thus developing the world further and emphasising the horrific threat posed by the homunculi. Alongside this comes an assortment of arse-kickingly awesome fights. Brotherhood doesn’t hold back and really packs its punches with far more brutal violence than its predecessor. Blood splatters from every direction, people get impaled, sliced, shot in the head, and burned to a crisp – all in gloriously animated detail. While not excessively gory or sadistic, this unsubdued approach to fighting makes each battle all the more exciting to watch, while adding a contextual sense of realism. This all results in a story that feels so damn epic you’ll be watching episodes in the thirties thinking that it can’t get any better… until you get to the forties… and then the fifties…
My only minor quibbles with Brotherhood’s plot stem from two things. Firstly comes the somewhat unnecessary re-cap with Hohenheim sitting around a fire re-counting the various events thus far in episode twenty seven. Such episodes generally feel rather pointless (unless the audience is particularly dense or the narrative ridiculously convoluted), but aside from that, they also ruin the show’s pacing. Secondly, is that due to skipping the Youswell coalmines arc, Yoki’s presence seems somewhat downplayed. While the incident receives vague explanation in the form of flashback, and sure he’s not a major character, it would have been better to dedicate an episode to this arc and make more sense of his existence within the plot – heck, it would have been a much better use of twenty-four minutes than the summary.
Animation
Brotherhood must have had a rather large production budget, as the animation is sumptuous and at times literally breathtaking. Smooth movement and nicely detailed backgrounds complete with an almost painterly texture effect make the series truly pleasurable to watch. When it comes to action sequences, there are no cutting corners with cheesy action lines, or ‘epic still shotz of awesomez’. No, instead Ed, Al and the gang jump, hop, and dash across the screen with a veritable eyegasm of dust clouds at every rock fall and sparks flying as metal clashes against (full) metal.
In the same manner as the rest of the visuals, Bones does a glorious job of animating blood. One particularly striking shot shows a tear falling onto a drop of the carmine liquid on Lin’s cheek, and the subtlety showing the two fluids merge, with the crimson tone watering down ever so slightly, is simply dazzling. From jets projecting themselves across the screen as characters are slashed by swords, to a large pool gradually oozing from beneath a fallen corpse, as much care has gone into these details as into Ed’s rapid fighting movements.
Sound
Accompanying the beautiful animation and kick-ass plotline comes a gorgeous orchestral soundtrack with brass notes through to softer string melodies reflecting the series’ wide variety of moods. While choral tracks – courtesy of the Warsaw Philharmonic Choir – enhance the haunting nature or dramatic revelations of certain scenes, tribal tones add an extra pace to busier action sequences to fully round out an altogether stunning soundtrack.
Brotherhood’s voice actors provide superb performances all around with each seiyuu capturing their character’s personality and mood exceptionally well. Sure I could knock off a mark for cheesy commercial bumper guy whose annoying voice belts out ‘Fullmetal Alchemist’ week after week, but it’d be like saying the best day of your life was ruined by having to take a leak at lunchtime.
Characters
Fullmetal Alchemist has always boasted two of the strongest protagonists in any anime or manga. Ed has a lot of the stereotypical heroic qualities, such as immense power, a hot head and a rash attitude, which could work against him, except he counteracts these with visible weaknesses. He tries to act tough but gives in to fear and despair, and he has a very short fuse when it comes to his height complex – something that not only highlights his imperfections, but also provides a lot of the comedic content. On top of this, the fullmetal boy goes on a massive learning curve as he finds out the truth behind everything he thought he knew, maturing with each new and horrific revelation. He doesn’t glorify or try to skip over his past actions; instead he attempts to atone for his sins without having others pay for his mistake, all of which makes him more compelling to watch than a vapid hero vowing to save the world.
In the same vein, Al could easily fall into the trap of becoming “the nice one”; he’s generous, kind, patient and likes small animals – doesn’t sound too interesting when you put it like that, does he? However, he has one massive metallic reason for avoiding this pitfall: his lack of physical body. Spending his life as a soul in an empty suit of armour gives the young boy a melancholy that makes him so much more intriguing. Suddenly, all of his positive attributes seem brave, and if he does break down, or show weakness or anger, it becomes all the more powerful.
While Ed and Al could carry the story themselves, the show’s supporting characters prove just as memorable as its protagonists. For an anime boasting such a large overall cast, Brotherhood develops its varied individuals exceptionally well; in particular, the fact that the Elric brothers aren’t the only heroes certainly helps this. A lot of the biggest battles are either joint efforts, with multiple allies ganging up on their foe, or permits one of the secondary characters to momentarily claim the limelight for themselves. With multi-faceted personalities, no one feels flat, dull, or a waste of the space they take up on screen. Allowing for plenty of evolution in both its protagonists and antagonists, the series accords reasonable motive behind everyone’s actions, which ultimately makes the audience care and certain deaths all the more poignant – whether through genuine upset (and full on gushing waterfalls of tears) at a fatality or the shock that you actually feel a upset at a bad guy’s demise.
Overall
I’d love nothing more than to just yell “WATCH IT, WATCH IT NOW! STOP SCRATCHING YOUR BUTT AND PRESS PLAY!” over and over for a thirteen hundred words, but as a reviewer, you must try to suppress your inner fanboy/fangirl for fear of over-rating a show purely because you love it. As such, dishing out a high overall score is not an easy undertaking, but Brotherhood genuinely deserves this praise. Overall, it provides a little over twenty-five and a half hours worth of pant-wettingly epic entertainment. With a gripping plot, consistently glorious animation, a beautiful and befitting orchestral soundtrack, and a full, well-rounded cast, this anime remains one of the best series that I have seen to date, and I’m pretty certain that it’ll be a long time before I see anything this good again.

                If there's one word I could use to describe the show, it would be consistent. For better for worse the show never really deviates from its initial standards. For the most part it hovers just above mediocrity, then around cour 4 starts getting more interesting up until the very end. However, this consistency means there's no roller-coaster of quality where an incredibly dull episodes would be followed by some incredibly hype episode. Your emotions would honestly stay the same for most of the show.
For a good chunk, the show is very much adventure-like, bringing Ed and friends all over the world on assorted fetch quests.
                  This element of world building is nice, but honestly has most of the show feeling like filler.  Each episode, especially from the first 3 cours feel like they could be condensed without removing much impact. The terrible comedic scenes also hurt both pacing and mood. It's executed so poorly most of the time but thankfully absent for cour 5.
Character-wise I never really liked any of the 2 main brothers. Their incorruptible goodness is too much for me, especially in an otherwise cynical world their optimistic and good-naturedness paying off feels so wrong for me. Colonel Mustang is best boy though. I wished more of the show was about him and the political stuff interspersed with the supernatural conspiracies.
Part of me is glad to have been on this ride while the other part of me is glad to get this over with. It's that kind of show. A very self-indulgent kind of show that thinks too highly of itself and can be easily condensed into maybe 3 movies instead of 22 hours of filler and drag. 
Now watching this made me discover Riza's seiyuu did Ichigo Mashimaro as the main character. What an excellent show that is.",7

                I finished this anime last year and it's still my favorite anime! The plotline is amazing and it's really good for Shounen lovers. It's action packed and the opening song is really catchy! To be honest, all 5 of the openings are amazing! They really put a lot of work into them. I really like the character designs it really goes well with the animation. The animation fits the story and setting as well. The variety of the characters' personalities will warm your heart so you feel them on an extremely high level of feels. There is always a hype for the next episode to
                  keep you hooked. There are many mysteries that lie in every episodes to make you ask questions to yourself. The only bad part is, the anime ends after 64 episodes. Which is okay, but I'm hungry for more episodes, even the story is finished. I love this anime to death, and will always be my all-time favorite. Hope you will watch this masterpiece and enjoy it like I do!",10
"
                I've often been disappointed with anime that have been praised like no other(Clannad,Clannad AF,Toradora,Attack on Titan,Anohana ect.) so going in to FMAB I was skeptical if I was going to wind up disappointed yet again.
And I can honestly say I enjoyed every bit of this show. Ive never watched an anime so fast in my life, I watched all 64 episodes in the span of 3 days, I can honestly see why people praise this show so much everything from the characters,story, animation was incredible and by the time it ended I still wanted more.",9

                I think there are many reasons why Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets such high ratings.
First of all, the story is very captivating with plot twists that keep the watcher wanting more.
Second, the characters are very well developed, even many of the supporting characters. They get their own storyline within the main one and it intertwines with it.
Third, this was a big one for me, the ending doesn't leave any questions behind. With all the twists and shocks, they're all answered somehow throughout the story.Basically, you finish the series feeling satisfied. At least that's pretty much how I felt. 
I know with many other animes it
                  will end and I would be left wondering what exactly was solved. Usually where the anime leaves me hanging, the manga usually covers it, since most anime stray from it's original manga (if there is one). 
Of course with Brotherhood, it is like the manga pages just up and animated themselves. Granted I've never read the manga, but this is what I've heard. ^^
These are just a few of the reasons why I thought FMA: Brotherhood was such an epic anime. :)",10
"
                if you liked the original FMA anime then you will LOVE Brotherhood! the animation ithink iz done flawlessly, and im glad they kept most of the original vioce actors. the main purpose of this version of FMA is so it iz WAY closer to the manga than the original anime wuz. this iznt completely like themanga though. to keep it interesting they mixed up the order of when they show what and i think this iz one of the best animes ive ever watched

                I have convinced multiple friends to watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, and we all ran into the same problem on out first viewings: We can't pick a favorite character because each one is damn near perfect. As someone who very rarely watches anime over 30 episodes long, I enjoyed every single episode of FMAB because it has an amazing story, insane action, and some of the best characters in any anime. Edward, Alphonse, Mustang, Kimblee, Heonheim, and virtually every character that's fleshed out is absolutely stellar. If you're an anime fan looking for one of the best stories ever written, and with the absolute best characters,
                  you owe it to yourself to watch Brotherhood.",10
"
                As I finish my unhealthy breakfast of leftover Taco Bell and ramen, let me tell you about a legacy called FullMetal Alchemist.
FullMetal Alchemist {FMA for short} is a franchise that follows two young brothers in an alternate European universe, shortly after industrialization, in which Alchemy is a common practice, and was weaponized for a country at war. There are some rules to alchemy; you can’t create something out of nothing, in order to create, something of equal value must be lost, and human transmutation is strictly forbidden. The aforementioned brothers lose their mother to sickness sometime after their father had left. Grief-stricken, the brothers Edward
                  and Alphonse attempt to re-create their mother’s body and bring her soul back from the dead. The cost? Literally and arm and a leg, plus Al’s entire body. And thus begins the story of FullMetal Alchemist...
The franchise started out as a manga, then spawned an Anime simply called FullMetal Alchemist, which only loosely followed the manga. With a movie, two games, some light novels and drama CDs in between, a second re-adaption of the story titled FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was created, following the manga almost verbatim.
Story: 10/10
The plot, to this day, is still very original. It’s not every day you hear about brothers wanting to get their bodies back, Alchemy also isn’t a very widespread theme in anime. The author obviously went to great lengths to do her research on the subjects of the anime, and utilized her vast imagination to create supernatural themes and plot twists. The story is very well written, very thought out, and portrayed very well. It progresses nicely throughout the anime, with next to no fillers.
With an episode count of 64, it would seem that the anime elongates the story, but not so. The concepts of FullMetal Alchemist could be a little difficult to understand without the proper explanations. No, I’m not saying there’s episodes full of lecture, I’m saying that most of the explanations are portrayed by example an realizations. That is a HUGE plus for me. I don’t think there’s anything more irritating than the characters explaining the obvious, or voicing what they’re figuring out all the time, as if the audience is stupid. The only minor gripe I have is that it pulls a bit of a Dragon Ball Z towards the end. And by that I mean, fights take episodes to conclude. It’s very minor, though, and understandable as the battles become more difficult and the length of them is nowhere near comparable to DBZ or even Naruto, so I hope it wouldn’t be an issue enough to cause someone to not finish this great anime.
Animation: 10/10
FMA is animated beautifully. There are differences in the facial features of the characters. Child characters look young in the face as well. One of my favorite animation features is that as the characters developed, you could see it in their physical stature. Also, the artist is good at portraying emotions in the eyes, which couldn’t be more useful in this emotionally charged anime. The backgrounds were drawn and painted beautifully, they almost looked 3D. What really perfected this score is the all the opening and ending credits being animated so beautifully and creatively. All with a cherry on top.
Sound: 9/10
All of the opening and ending songs were pretty unique and captured the tone of the manga during specific seasons perfectly. The music was composed nicely, and went with the current emotions of the anime at the perfect times. However, the same segments of the same songs were used over and over and over again, and it got a little annoying after a while.
Characters: 10/10
Each and every character is unique, with their own little trademarks. The characters meshed well together, even the antagonists. If the characters weren’t how they are, then I don’t think FMA would be half as good as it is. Plot progressed because of character’s motives and resolve, they weren’t just pawns to utilize to get an idea across. They were far from dry, and I found myself getting attached to each and every one of them. If you’ve read any of my reviews before, then you should know that I’m quite fond of character development, and that’s quite abundant in this anime. And as I’ve stated previously; changes in the character’s physical appearance correlated with the change in the character’s character.
Overall: 9.8/10
But why not a perfect 10, Melodux? It’s such a good anime! It is, but if you had read my review up to this point, then you would know that it’s not a perfect anime. I am fully aware that some people are much more critical of anime than I, and would get QUITE annoyed with the minor gripes I had made, and stop watching it. What makes it a good anime? Its originality and the way everything is tied together so well. Story and characters work in harmony, the animation make the portrayal of the story easy on the eyes, and the music adds finishing touches to make it all complete.
Melodux’s Musings – Why you should watch this version as well as the original: First off, I count the first animated edition of FullMetal Alchemist the “original,” because it came out before Brotherhood. Brotherhood was a good idea to keep the franchise going, and if you’re looking to skip out on reading the lengthy manga, watching Brotherhood is a good way to do it. I bet you’re thinking “OK, so if I watch this, then I have the gist of everything, right? Why would I want to watch the original?” or “I’ve watched Brotherhood, and it’s amazing, nothing will compare, I won’t even look at the original!” BOTH STORIES ARE EQUALLY AS GOOD: the original follows the manga until about the middle of the story and is an equally interesting re-telling of the story. Consider it an “alternate ending” of sorts. If you like the characters and themes in Brotherhood, then the original will be just as good. Conversely, if you enjoyed the characters and themes in the original, then prepare for a more detailed, enhanced animated version of the story while watching Brotherhood.",9
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is what every single anime series based off of a manga should be, and this was executed so well, words can't even describe it.
This story is a work of art, and will keep you guessing and surprised each passing episode. The character development is phenomenal, and watching them all change and grow throughout is one of the greatest parts of this series. The art and animation is beautifully done, and the voice acting is spot on. Some parts are just...they're so good, you feel the emotion running through you.
Overall, this is a must watch series to any anime fan out there. If
                  sci-fi and adventure aren't your cup of tea, try it anyways. It will lure you in and you'll find yourself left with a heart made of fullmetal at the end. :]",10
"
                This anime is very OVERRATED but it's not bad. I really tried to enjoy these episodes but it just never grabbed me. It wasn't my first anime so maybe I was really spoiled or something. I ended up dropping the anime. I don't even remember what I watched if I think about it.
The Characters never felt interesting at all and the episodes felt so boring to me. NGL that chimera episode was sad and horrific T_T.
The only reason why I even watched this is that all my friends at the time swore it was better than all the top anime like a certain yellow-haired ninja
                  but daaaaaamn that was a snooze fest for me.",5
"
                I will admit that i have not seen everyshow that people say is the best so when i kept hearing the great reviews of the so called the best ever i was not excited because the last time i saw the next best thing since sliced bread named chobits oh boy was that bad. So i thought okay best anime ever bring it on. OH MY GOD was this good. I could not believe the story of two brothers who live in a world of alchemy tried to do the greatest of alchemy taboos to bring there mother back but it goes horribly wrong. That
                  is not only perfect but it sets up the characters perfectly. You realy fet for there sorrow it makes me want to cry. I love the Elrics and i was truly sorry and would have done the same thing and Mays hughs oh mays sorry i started to cry a bit but im better. I also love Roy Mustang and his trouble living with the fact his best friend is dead and if Envy is reading you diserve what came to you. The art is phenomenal and the opening is great i honestly cant hate this show if you want me to knit pick it has to be the fact that the japanese sub is not that good but then the english dub swoops in and does the best dubs ive ever heard overal it is a perfect 10 out of 10 so i love this anime and i cant wait to finish this great show.",10

                Story
The universe in FMA is huge. There is an overabundance of lore and the best part of it is that the rules remain very consistent. Not a lot of ass pulls that are common in other shows. The show tackles themes such as science vs religion, the  nature of blind government obedience, racism, and family values. However, the show is fairly long and does suffer from some minor pacing problems. Most of the story is enjoyable however.
Art
The animation is very consistent and the production values are apparent.
Sound
 I found myself enjoying the opening and ending themes very much. The only one I didn't love
                  was the first and third ending themes. 
Character
The characters have great backstory and motivations. Character development is very apparent in many, not just one character, however I found the last antagonist to be rather bland and evil for the sake of being evil. With a large cast, there are bound to be some unmemorable ones.
Enjoyment
An excellent show that is sometimes thought provoking. Doesnt do anything revolutionary, but what it does it does very well. Easy to follow and get into.
Overall
Great watch, one of the best Shounen easily",9
"
                This is my first and probably my last review, but I really just have to write a view on this goddamn hell of a masterpiece. 
For a while, I didn't really want to fully watch this because the animation style looked poor, and I did drop it after 2 episodes. I picked it back up and rewatched episode 2, and then I proceeded to watch all 62 more episodes in just 7 days just because I was already hooked. It really blew away all of my expectations because it was #1 on MAL, but I didn't like the storyline or art at the time. Obviously,
                  that stuff was outshined by the other aspects and became my favorite anime.
Character: 10/10
All of the characters truly were shown so great compared to many other characters I've seen. Almost all of them were very damn likable and they were so different. I only didn't really like 2 or 3 characters, but the rest of them I loved. Pride, King Bradley, Greed, Alex, Edward and Envy were my favorites, and probably most peoples' favorites because of how likable and great they were.
Story: 9/10
To be honest, I don't really think this was a compelling main storyline, but I seriously loved all of the small parts along their journey. The people they encountered, the objectives they had to overcome, the ways they achieved their small goals all to reach their main intent. It was not the most unique plotline, but it surely made me keep watching it.
Art: 8/10
I was really not a fan of the animation style just because it didn't really look like anything I've seen before. It looked pretty ugly when I first started anime, but now it's actually pretty nice. I got used to it from watching those 64 episodes and I'm pleased because it will help me overcome my disliking for old animation styles. The fight scenes were also pretty damn good, while even the regular walking around scenes had a nice feel to them.
Sound: 10/10
Holy shit, of those 10 OPs and EDs, 7 of them are superior to a lot of the songs I've heard, and 3 of them are top tier. The OSTs were also pretty nice, but not very memorable. I also really enjoyed the voice acting. Greed's VA was one of my favorites and Edward's was annoying for a little bit, but I eventually began to like it. Overall, I actually didn't not like any of the characters voices because it's pretty hard to have a character with an annoying voice.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Literally a 10/10. I was instantly hooked on the second episode, and just binged all of it in one week as I said before. At around episode 40, I made it my #7 favorite just 'cause it was progressing perfectly. I think near episode 50 it reached my top 5, and at episode 60 it got to my #1. I thoroughly loved all of this, because it really flew past all of my expectations and presented a nice and long shounen adventure.
Overall: 10/10
Literally a 10/10. I honestly don't believe anything can top this. I said this about Hunter x Hunter and Bungou Stray Dogs, but this, just, is too damn spectacular. I loved it so damn much even though they don't have my favorite characters. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood really does deserve the rating it has right now, and I believe it should stay that way.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the anime that most people that consume this media are likely to have both watched and highly appreciated. There are varying reasons for which this series has reached critical acclaim, but rather than focus on every one of the reasons for which every single person and their dog think Brotherhood is great, I’d rather focus on what I consider to explain why I consider Brotherhood to be the best show to introduce anime as a form of media to a new audience.
First let me give you the basic premise: In the world of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, everyone is capable of transforming
                  the matter of any object into something else as long as they follow and understand the Law of Equivalent Exchange: in order to gain something, one must sacrifice something of equal value. This means that as long as you are capable of understanding the structure and composition of an object, you can harness Alchemy as a skill and are pretty much capable of doing anything your imagination allows. Certain forms of Alchemy are more complex than others because they require more knowledge and capability from the user. One of the most complex is Human Alchemy, which brings me to the Elric Brothers, our main characters. As a group of normal kids growing up into a rural area of this world alongside their mother, they eventually lose her at an early age. The kids then vow to bring her back using alchemy, and set as their goal to gather enough knowledge to attempt to bring her back. Eventually, they gather enough knowledge to attempt to bring her back, but due to the fact that this is a complex process, they didn’t have all the information required and fail to bring her back. Even worse, one of the brothers loses some of his body parts, while the other loses his entire body, but has his soul affixed to a suit of armor in an attempt to save him. They survive the attempt and realize their efforts were futile after experiencing this colossal failure. After understanding that regardless of their intentions, there are limits to what they can do they set as a goal to regain their bodies and to continue moving forward.
One of the most prevalent elements in anime is the intensity of the goal its main characters have and how hard they attempt achieving it. Be it they are happy go lucky characters that want to be acknowledged by their peers, be it they want to challenge the world to change it for what they consider it to be better, be it they want to improve their life and current circumstances, almost every well received show possesses someone that single mindedly follows their goal with a laser eyed focus.  Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood still has that element instilled in its core but in a more grounded manner. One of the main differences in execution is that the show doesn’t just present you the goal of the Elric brothers, but instead makes you understand what caused them to pursue it, how they plan to achieve it, who they are in the process and why they chose this path. And that was all done by showing how they failed to achieve their goal prior to starting pursuing their path. They fail at reviving their mother, because they themselves did not understand how to achieve their goal. They did not understand the fundamental value of the show, that being “in order to gain something, one must sacrifice something of equal value”. It is not only applied in a mechanical sense in the show, but also in an existential sense. In less pretentious terms, this means that the higher the value of said something, the harder it is to obtain, because you will also have to lose something that you value. Since the brothers did not understand what they are doing and what they were trying to obtain, they fail their journey. And this shows to the viewer, that in this story, the characters can fail, and that regardless of how much they intend to achieve their goal, they will have to work hard and sacrifice things they value to achieve what they intend to achieve. The goal of the Elric Brothers is not an idealistic worldly ambition that challenges reality. It is merely something personal, to once again live normal lives, unshackled by their past. So one of the highest appealing elements of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, is how well in its execution it has managed to portray the intent and journey of the characters it is presenting.
Another highly prevalent element in anime is the world it tries to present and all of the fantastical elements existing in the story. Anime tries to intrigue the audience with its world in a lot of varying ways, be it by creating worlds where a lot of threats exist and adventure is lurking at every corner, be it the laws of the world allow the characters to do incredible feats and that are impressive to watch, be it the world is just different from our own in ways that are interesting. Regardless of the approach, Brotherhood creates a world where everything I have stated is indeed present, but the world hasn’t been created to just be intriguing, but rather to illustrate its theme and to create a world where the goal of the Elric Brothers can be best portrayed. It has every element that makes the world of what you are shown intriguing, and all of these elements are not forced, but instead give more depth to the story at large. Rather than overusing the concept of alchemy, it treats this power as something scientific and of high skill to pursue. While it did indeed shape the world we see, the world of Fullmetal Alchemist is believable, and not that different from our own. Rather than having every character shape their life around this power and this world, each live relatively normal lives, not that different from our own, with alchemy just being a branch of science that helps the world further advance. While it did create new threats and opportunities for adventure, while it allows incredible feats to be done by the characters in it, it also manages to be similar to reality. And this happens due to one reason. The concept of its powers is merely abstract and highly reliant on the user’s knowledge and skill. Any character is capable of doing anything in this world, through any approach and way they imagine. Their only limits are: understanding what they are doing, be skilled enough to give shape to what they imagine, and having the imagination to think of it. This means that regardless of how fantastical the powers are, they can only be as impressive as the character that manages to use them in the way they intend. This means that alchemy is a skill that requires training and its results are only as exceptional as the person delivering them. And as a concept, due to its requirements, alchemy doesn’t cause the characters to achieve feats that are impossible to achieve. Only feats that are impossible to achieve in that immediate moment. Anything that you would know how to do or is possible to happen, you can do. The alchemists have the capacity to make this process take seconds rather than weeks, months or years due to their capacity to immediately materialize it. So at the same time, it is a concept that is very open ended that at the same time, it is limited by what we are limited in reality, our understanding.
The way it defines the character motivation and world building is what is exceptional about Brotherhood. From this point onwards, I’ll outline the elements that are familiar to other anime.
Throughout the story, the characters will face moral dilemmas and a lot of the themes presented in the show will relate back to meaningful relationships. A lot of the times characters will have to weight how much they value their achievements against how much they value their peers. From a moral standpoint, it has the same heart most shows have. The good guys put their selfish interests aside for the benefit of everyone else.  While the bad guys selfishly follow their goals without any qualms about the people surrounding them. The Law of Equivalent Exchange relates back once again in an abstract way to the execution of the show. One question that it asks its characters is, are you willing to achieve your goals right now by sacrificing the people you value? It does cover the subject really well in a manner that fits the world it presents, and executes on this well, but this is a subject that will be very familiar to you in other series moving forward. So be informed that anime will often criticize selfishness and portray it as evil while portraying groups of people that are interdependent as the morally righteous ones. Not saying this is something that is not earned in Fullmetal Alchemist, but rather that this is something frequent in anime and one of the things you should expect going forward unless you are searching keenly enough.
A common way anime tries to be entertaining is action. Showing confrontations between two or multiple characters using their superpowers to injure or kill each other. Due to its world, Fullmetal Alchemist has a lot of success in being entertaining in each fight through interesting ways. A lot of the confrontations are memorable not only due to their stakes, but also due to the solution the characters in the confrontation find to resolve it. Another way it attempts to be entertaining is humor which I will say is not Brotherhood’s strong suit. Not because the jokes themselves are bad, but because they are often timed poorly, in a dramatic moment where they temporarily deflate a situation briefly, or said too often. Still, the style of humor used by Brotherhood, that of character quips and slapstick, is something that is present in anime, especially of Brotherhood’s era, and it is something that Brotherhood can help you familiarize with. While humor is subjective, the way it is used in Brotherhood is not helpful in carrying the story across and is often an obstacle you will have to get used to.
Other ways anime tries to appeal to you is with its characters, by presenting you characters with interesting designs, personalities and powers. While all of these elements are covered in Brotherhood, characterization is actually something that is hurt by the story’s themes, since the characters are often presented through the lense of “do they base their decisions on how they can achieve their goals at all costs, or do they have moral principles”. You understand that each character has a goal of their own and a distinct personality, but the way they make decisions is often always predictable. Very few of the characters perform outside of the theme presented by the story, and because of that, their alignment often determines the behavior they have moving forward. There are characters that do not fit this description and certainly give the world more color, but given the sheer amount of characters presented in a 51 episodes series, they are not enough. Most people are probably going to be fine with understanding how the characters will act before they do, because each character is distinct enough, but this is yet another flaw anime has. Due to its strong focus at portraying the theme of the story and the goals of its characters, it will often end up being predictable if you understand the story enough and the characters will keep revolving around it.
Another flaw that anime that are strongly orientated towards a character achieving one of their goals  is the fact that the goal they seek to achieve is the very reason the show exists, and that being resolved would end the show. As a result, they cannot achieve or attempt to achieve that goal until the show ends. That is one thing that is unfortunately true about Brotherhood as well. More often than not, the show relies on presenting the characters through the journey they managed to complete in the past and its consequences rather than gaining tangible progress towards the goal they sought to achieve. The pace then becomes predictable and you are waiting for events to progress in certain scenarios if the series is too uneventful. Luckily Brotherhood is often eventful and there is often always something going on or something more to learn about the world and its characters, but the fact that the characters cannot resolve what gives their journey meaning because the story cannot reach its conclusion yet is something that had bothered me. Still, I can understand that the characters need as much information as possible to understand their journey and how to achieve their goal, since a lack of information is what caused their current situation, but in a story where the fundamental power given to the characters is to cause things to materialize fast, not having a tangible progress towards their outcome is questionable, because all they are doing is reacting to the world based on their moral principles while searching for the right answer. This is the reason why a lot of the people that never watched Brotherhood but watched a great number of shows decide to not pick it up. It is predictable and the theme it presents while executed well in a very interesting world is not something worthwhile to put up with if you understand how everything is going to play out. Its laser focus on the execution of its theme has caused it to not be able to think about anything else that might be interesting about it.
To conclude, you should watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood if you plan to start exploring anime as media. It is a great starting point and a great first experience for one of the most frequent themes presented in this medium. But I do not recommend Brotherhood to anyone that understands that these flaws have bothered them in the past and at the same time have seen shows like it. It is a good execution on its themes, yes, but if you are already tired of them, the show can only at best keep you entertained with its action and world and at worst bore you because you have already been presented its theme in a bunch of different ways. However if you are not tired of its themes, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood presents you with a world that has a lot of depth and a goal that is set up really well and valued. It is consistently entertaining and its humor should not detract too much of your viewing pleasure if you are interested in the other elements.",7

                I'm new to anime in general, so I hope that my perspective can provide something to veteran viewers. I'm by no means an experienced critic, but I'll try my best. Also if you disagree, please don't get angry because I'd love to have a discussion about it. That's what we're all here for right?
Story: 10/10
This 10/10 is compared to every anime I've seen so far. I have few unanswered questions. Many people seem to think that worldbuilding is about how much stuff you write about a world, but an often ignored aspect is what you don't answer. The mysteries about what 'the truth' is, what
                  the foreign countries are like, all of these serve to make the world feel more expansive.
The storyline is fantastic. It starts off without much direction, but quickly goals and objectives for each of the characters are established, and the show takes off. Not once did I feel like the pacing was too slow. Maybe a bit fast in the beginning. And it had good plot twists and revelations.
Art: 7/10
Again, this is just compared to other shows I've seen. The drawing style of the characters just isn't personally what I fuck with. That being said, I think that the show benefits majorly in some ways from the art style of its characters. A lot of anime's portray an unrealistic image. I've watched a few Isekai, and it's a little gross that every female character has massive boobs, and is drawn to be incredibly beautiful.
I genuinely appreciated finding a show where I don't feel like the portrayal of women is unrealistic and objectifying. However, I can't say that the way characters are drawn is aesthetically pleasing. It has a rough quality to it. On the other hand, the scenery is usually fantastic, and brings a lot of life into the world. 
The architecture used helps to associate what cultural values the country has. The more European look of buildings in our main setting establishes western values, while other places that we visit such as Ishvala, we can immediately understand are going to have a distinctly foreign culture just based off of their architecture. I approve.
Sound: 7/10
I'm not going to spend much time here, because I didn't pay much attention to the sound, so it would be stupid to pretend I have much of an opinion. There weren't any moments where the sound design blew me away. I know this because I literally hadn't considered the sound design until I began this review. In other words, it was just fine.
The music on the other hand, got stale at points. I'm not into the anime intros as much as some people. In fact, I find that most anime intros are rather boring musically. That's just my personal opinion, and I wouldn't want anyone to feel bad based on my judgement. If you enjoy the songs used in the intros and outros, then I'm happy for you, because it means you have one more thing in life that you get to enjoy. I just simply don't care much for them.
The music choices in the rest of the show were problematic at points. Some scenes where were supposed to sympathize with characters had music that simply didn't evoke an emotional reaction. Like Winry crying over something, and then they play some odd choir/hymn music straight out of the Renaissance. It just doesn't mesh well.
Characters: 8/10
As someone else pointed out here, there wasn't much effort put into bringing the characters to life. A lot of anime I've seen so far make characters that are almost too perfect. Or their characters simply fulfill a plot need without much else. FMA didn't do either of those, but was closest to the latter.
There could have been more slice-of-life moments that showcase these characters personal preferences and add onto their personalities in this way. However, I understand this show was plot-driven more than it was character-driven so I don't mind it so much.
I do feel like the show could have done more to show how the MCs have grown and learned. I wish there had been some benchmark established to compare the growth of the characters to. My takeaway for Ed was that he learns that alchemy can't solve everything. However, the situations in the show in which alchemy couldn't solve, didn't make that point obvious enough, and thus obscured the growth that Ed undergoes.
Enjoyment: 6/10
I want to acknowledge that this is overall a fantastic show, definitely worth a watch. I understand that many people enjoy it, and I think you're justified and valid for loving it.
But I have to be honest: I'm a simp. I love romance, and easily get attached to characters. That's the one thing that I enjoy the most above everything else in a show. I'm like an overexcited white girl watching The Bachelorette. And because of that, and because of the shows focus on the world and themes over the characters, it just didn't have the same potential for enjoyment.
This is a super subjective taste, and I don't want anyone to think I'm making an objective statement about the show. In fact, I think that I'm objectively a little stupid for not being able to see past my obsession with characters and enjoy the beautiful storyline and worldbuilding. But, I can't change how I feel.
Overall: 7/10
I think many people here will enjoy this show at the level of an 8/10, 9/10 or 10/10. So I highly recommend you watch if you're into worldbuilding and rich plotlines.",7
"
                All i can say is finally. I've been putting this show off for two years. 
I read the manga about 3 years ago.
OK ill start with the story. its a nice blend of military and shounen. but it feels horribly mixed with comedy. umm not really anything negative about the story besides the pacing it feels waaay to long during the later half of the anime.
the art is OK better than the old one by a bit. the op and ed are where the art really shows. probably just me but i hate it when anime try to pull manga style gags with the art.
                  
the music really didn't get my attention for any of this so i gave it a 5
overall it started out good but started to really drag halfway through it has a nice ending though. a bit to militaristic for my tastes. worth the watch but I don't get the hype",4
"
                What I love most about ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" is the world building, the design and the depth of each and every character in this anime, especially the strong personalities that are given to the female ones, they really stand out. The animation is amazing and stunning, the plot is plenty of details and well written and it's really cool to see how the serie becomes bloodier with each episode. Lots of emotions on this one, very enjoyable and touching. Easily one of the best I've ever seen. I just hope the OVAs are as good as the anime, we will see.
              ",9

                In my opinion:
overrated, I watched it with high expectations, like 10/10 but it is just a 5. The first episode is very catchy but the rest of the story I struggled to keep watching, I expected a better use from alchemy, in fights mainly. The main characters aren't very  impressive, just two brothers that don't have rare powers and dont want to kill. The story is meh, I would have liked to watch a better develpoment about how the brothers get their bodies back, I didnt care about a group of villains who wanted to kill the whole city, like that turned to the
                  main story and was sooooooo boring. I just post this review to release my stress for watching such a boring anime and to let others know that it is not a masterpiece for everyone.",5
"
                THE OVERALL SCORE IS ARBITRARY.
My rating for Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood: Must watch for everyone.
This is a show that masterfully blends elements from a variety of different genres into one masterpiece that is nearly impossible to dislike. FMAB does everything well and excels in it's character development and it's song selection. Most shows are only good for those who like the genre but FMAB does so many things so well that I believe EVERYONE should at the very least try it. Lets break it down
Story: The story is nothing special but it's also done well and it keeps you captivated. You follow the two Elric brothers
                  as they travel throughout the country trying to find a way to restore their bodies. Its not too complicated and can be thoroughly enjoyed even if you don't care about any of the nuances in the show. The actual progression of said story (the search for the philosophers stone to restore their bodies) is fairly generic and gets carried by the amazing characters in the show.
Characters: I can't stress enough how good the character development in this show is. Many shows have a strong main cast of characters and a background cast that's developed just enough for you to remember they exist. FMAB, on the other hand, has a literal army of characters that you not only remember, but actually care about. Both Edward and Alphonse are interesting to follow, Winry is the best supporting character I've ever seen (with a beautifully non forced romance between her and Ed), Mustang is arguably THE main character as a character who gets almost no screen time compared to the Elric brothers... I could keep going. If there is any reason to watch Brotherhood over the original it's the characters.
Sound: Just listen to one of the opening songs. Or endings. This show is easily a contender for the show with the best chosen music. No other shows songs has ever brought me to tears but FMAB's songs do it consistently, while the other songs hype you up for the battle between the protagonists and the Homunculi. 
Art: Look it up and judge for yourself. I think brotherhood is a beautiful show but this category is more subjective than the others.
The most important aspect of this show though, is that it isn't basic. It's core principle (Equivalent Exchange) creates a lot of thought. While watching this show you can either: zone out and watch the Elric brothers beat the **** out of everything and everybody OR actually think about the underlying themes in the show and spend some time on the show after watching it. Both ways are exciting and can suit a wide audience. 
Closing thoughts: For those who are brand new to the FMA franchise, I suggest watching Brotherhood first. Brotherhood is the prettier show, with stronger characters and better music. The original excels in it's story and most particularly it's ending. I believe that watching FMA first would spoil the experience that is Brotherhood.",10
"
                I saw the originally FMA that came out in 2003 and I loved it. However, I loved this version even more. Although I've never read the anime, this one was supposed to be more based off of it. The first one ended in a strange way for my tastes and although I have yet to finish brotherhood, I'm bracing myself for an epic end. Everything about this series is good. From the artwork to the development of the characters. We see them grow and have to make tough decisions throughout the story as they debate whether their original goal is worth pursing over the greater
                  good. Even if you haven't watched much anime, you won't be able to help loving this one. 
Another thing I like about this series is that there are few filler episodes, and even the ones that could be classified as filler, seem to benefit the story in some way.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an anime that came out in 2009. It was released 6 years after the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime. Unlike that one however, it follows the manga completely. This is the highest rated show on MAL and considered the best anime of all time by many. I disagree however and find the show highly overrated, especially compared to its older 2003 brother. But why is that?
Also, SPOILER ALERT.
----------------------STORY----------------------------- (7/10)
Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood ( I will refer it as FMA:B from now on) tells the story of the Elric Brothers. The Elrics were abandoned by their father when they were kids and soon after, their
                  mother died. The brothers tried following in their father's footsteps and become alchemists, in order to try human transmutation, a taboo among alchemists which should, theoretically, allow them to bring their dead mother back to life. This goes horribly wrong however, with a rebound occuring. Edward lost his left leg and Alphonse lost his entire body. After Edward had a brief meeting with ""God"", he quickly gave his right arm too in order to bring Alphonse back. Now, the Elric brothers are in a quest to find the Philosopher stone, which will allow them to get their bodies back by immensly amplifying their alchemic abilities. Sounds neat right? Well, no. While the backstory is great, the Plot REALLY, REALLY, REALLY suffers until about episode 12. After that, it is pretty mediocre untill episode 40. After that, it is amazing, hence the rating of ""7"".  The opening arcs are rushed and are quite frankly, boring. I would advise no one watches the first 12 episodes of this series and just watches the first 28 of the 2003 series, which cover the same stuff, but much better. However, be warned. There are differences in the 2003 anime that definetely didn't happen in FMA:B, like the way homoculi are born, and the killer of Winry's parents (Roy in 2003, Scar in 2009). There is also a very good ending here, with Ed making a genius move. There also some very, very minor plot holes and stupid decisions made by some characters (damn, Ed is the equivelant of Shirou Emiya in this show), they are not too annoying.
-------------------------Art (8)---------------------------------------------
This is a great looking series. It is no Fate series, BUT, it is very good looking. The highlight, is of course, the action sequences. Especially the final fight. They are done amazingly well. Just, go watch some samples.
---------------------------Sound(9)-----------------------------------------------------
Arguably, the show's biggest strength. It has amazing voice acting (especially the English dub), great soundtrack and nice sound effects. 
-----------------------Characters(9)-------------------------------------------
If not the sound, then the characters are what carry this show. Despite showing 0 character devlopment in the 12 first episodes, it all changes at around episode 22. The best character of all, in my opinion, is ""Greeling"". Now, this does NOT include the villain. The villain is a big ""meh"", because his plan is just bad. neither does it include the homonculi, because they are basically nothing compared to 2003. On their own, they serve as good antagonists to fight, but they show no character, other than the way they all die.
---------------------------Enjoyment(6)----------------------------------------------
Hey, how can I give it only a 6 when I praised the rest? Well, hold on. The first 12 episodes made me absolutely HATE the show. It was also quite a mess untill episode 40. After that, it got a lot better, but not enough to bring the enjoyment to anything higher than a ""6"".  Also, I didn't enjoy it as much because of the hype surrounding this show. I was really let down, although having key parts of the show spoiled for me, didn't help either. Also, I am saying this right now. The comedy in this series, is AWFUL. 
 FMA:B Pros
+ Backstory with ""God"" can keep you hooked on the plot
+ Great action scenes
+ The rich atmosphere and world it creates. Didn't nail it as good as 2003, but I would still love to visit Amestris
+ The characters 
+ The ending
+ The sound
+1st and 4th opening songs are great
+ It has some really great moments, my favorite being when Edward healed himself in episode 42.
FMA:B cons
- First episode is a filler. Now, this may not be a problem for some of you,but if you are anything like me (get done with the story and move on), then this is a problem. 
- Opening arcs are terrible
- Minor plot holes 
- Awful comedy
- 2nd, 3rd and 5th openings range from bad to mediocre.
-  Lighter tone compared to 2003. This may not bother you, but I felt that a darker, more serious tone suited the fullmetal alchemist universe better.
Overall, this is, in my opinion, an overrated series. It is good, but overrated. FMA:B is one of those animes where the good, are really good but the bad are really bad.",7
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist is just overall, a must-see classic. Everything is just utterly phenomenal. The story is brilliant, and the characters are extremely well thought out. When you first see this anime, it's a bit confusing. You kind of have an idea, but not really. When you really see the story unfold, it's just tragic and beautiful. Edward and Alphonse's relationship is honestly just inspiring and heartbreaking. You will not regret seeing this anime. For the soundtrack- It is amazing! They did a really good job on it. The artwork did seem a bit cartoon-y for me at first, only because I was probably used to
                  seeing the original. 
 Please note when your watching this, it goes extremely fast. They pretty much created this with the thought that everyone watched the original first. If you want a slowed down beginning, the first one is the one you want.",10
"
                FMAB is pretty much amazing to watch and easy to get addict to , i've felt a little disappointed in the end because i 've found some character's encounters so dry when they should have been so much more emotional , for example , two characters who don't see eachother for years and finally meet and then they just act all normal like they have seen eachother the day before. I found the ending a little bit unclear and disappointing too but it is something i could live with because u can mostly predict the future. The action in the anime is not that much
                  but wisely used and i have apreciated every single episode taking out that one where it makes a sypnosis about all the previous story. The thing i mostly apreciatted in the anime was the character developing , loved to see so many different personalities , sizes and background stories from both sides of the teams , one of my favorite characters has to be "" Greed "" , i think it adds a lot of fun to the anime. The anime is pretty much fun to watch too as it provides a lot of humour between the drama and avoids the episode to become a filler , although in my opinion there wasn't such thing in this anime. The Art would be perfect if it wasn't for that ""Envy""'s transformation , the graphics get unbalanced and even the timing gets wrong , i have no idea what were they thinking about but it sucked.",9
"
                Ah! Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood , where do I begin. First things first I really doubted that this show would be as good as the original series even though this was the highest rated show on this website at that time. Now that I've finished watching both I can easily say that I loved Brotherhood more but that's just my opinion.
When it comes to Brotherhood the first thing I noticed was the pacing of the show. Stuff that took a long time to develop in the original just zoomed past and took me no time to get used to because I thoroughly enjoy fast paced anime.
                  Although I must say that Brotherhood had a much lighter tone in comparison to the original and the comic elements were always well timed and never even came close to feeling cringe worthy.
To me the main aspect in which Brotherhood trumps the original FMA is the ""emotions"" on show. This show can be serious at a moment and very sad and filled with emotion the next. It can make you laugh, cry, jump in your seat during the action sequences and in short it never fails in mesmerizing you.
Now for the individual ratings: 
STORY- 9/10
No surprises here, absolutely amazing plot line which I had no complaints with. Enough number of twists and turns to keep you hooked and a whirlwind of emotions awaits you around every corner.
CHARACTERS- 10/10
This for me is the exact area in which Brotherhood trumps the original FMA. There are a lot more characters with excellent character development to support the main protagonists, makes it a helluva lot more fun to watch and gives the series a unique zest.
SOUND- 9/10
Gotta say that the openings, endings are one of the best if not the best in anime history. Literally every opening is on point in portraying the emotions of the protagonists and the atmosphere of the show is enhanced due to the excellent soundtracks.
ART- 9/10
Again no complaints here as such, art could have been much better but again there was nothing too flashy here and it did the job well enough imo. 
OVERALL- 10/10
For me personally Brotherhood felt much better in literally all aspects but I do respect the original a lot too, for me the 6 year difference between the 2 seasons really shows here. The fact that Brotherhood was meant to be a complete adaptation of the manga also really reflects here, it has minor flaws but none worth paying heed to. I personally felt that this anime is one of the best anime's I've watched recently and it might just be one of the best anime's I will ever watch.",10
"
                What can be said about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood that nobody else has already. The story is incredible, the characters are magnificent, the action is thrilling. Everything about it FMA: Brotherhood just seems to thrill and satisfy viewers. I know it did for me. Given, it does start off slow, but as the episodes go on it speeds up and each episode one after another just keeps getting more compelling that the last. If you are already familiar with the original FMA then you should be able to jump right in to FMA: Brotherhood with ease. The original was by all means a good series but
                  FMA: Brotherhood takes the series to a whole new level. The Elric brothers story starts off in the same fashion as the original and takes you on a riveting trip full of tears, laughter and amazement until you are left in the most satisfying way you can possibly be left in. Definitely worth watching from start to finish and definitely deserves a spot on anyone's favorite anime list. It's just that good.",10
"
                After having watched the first anime adaption of Fullmetal Alchemist, I couldn't help feeling a sense of disappointment at the ending. It didn't follow the manga's ending, and it showed with a poor performance. In this redone version of the manga, the anime faithfully follows its counterpart and makes for a great show.
Story: 9
The story is great, but for me personally, the whole ""super power"" aspect of the anime almost feels a little overdone, as if I'd seen it already in many other shows. Even with this little hiccup, I still feel as though the story deserves praise for its complexities and plot twists.
Art: 9
The
                  artwork is very solid throughout the entire anime, but doesn't really do anything innovative or exciting to deserve a 10. The character models are solid, the uniforms of the soldiers are done well, and the locations and environments are good.
Sound: 10
I'm not one to usually ever praise English audio over its Japanese counterpart, but this anime has (in my opinion) superior English voice actors. The voice actors really put emotion into their characters, especially Vic. The only problem I have is that Alphonse's voice actor from the original hit puberty and couldn't do a repeat, so they had to bring in someone new who I think didn't do quite as good a job. But suffice to say that the voice acting is superb. The sound effects are also outstanding, especially when alchemy is being performed.
Character: 9
What I really like about this anime is that the multitude of characters introduced throughout the show are handled very appropriately. Supporting characters get their back stories explained thoroughly (for the most part), and the Elric brothers get the spotlight you'd expect the main characters to get.
Enjoyment: 9
When I feel like I have to watch the next episode right away, I know that the series is great. For me, I give a 10 in enjoyment when after I finish a series, I feel profoundly blown away. I didn't get that feeling after watching FMA, but that ""edge on your seat"" feeling was constantly there.
Overall: 9
How many anime can you REALLY give a 10? There aren't many, because anime masterpieces should totally blow your mind after you finish them. FMA is a great anime, but not a masterpiece.",9
"
                Review is pretty much to add to the praise that this show gets and to be honest it really deserves it. I'm gonna keep it short since you are probably going to run into a lot of the same praises.
Story: 10
A Plot that, in my last review would of been considered an idiot plot but won't because there are a lot of other factors going into what started this whole deal off: pulls you in with lots of emotion, action, and a nice comedy whip topping. Backstories are handled nicely and the plot doesn't stray off from target to much. Also a plot that follows
                  the manga, so there is that.
Art: 9
Bright, colorful locations mixed with dark dreary set pieces. The art doesn't fuck around. The character designs are also a plus since the studio took the time to carve a lot of detail into each character. And this applies to whether the character is getting damaged or just actively growing. The visual effects are also really nice but some would say can be a bit over the top in some areas.
Sound: 10
Bliss to the ears this OST is. There are five Op's and five Ed's so you will find a couple if not like all of them. The background sounds also really help elevate the emotion with the scene. From dangerous to epic to sad, it all works. Voice acting was also really well done, each character almost like you would think they would as well as how they did in the original run of the show.
Characters 10
I'm starting to sound redundant myself now. Adding in the great design, great voice acting, and great use of story telling, the characters come out to being what really sucks you into the plot. Yuo will find plenty of main characters and side characters that you like.
Enjoyment: 10
IT''S GOOD, GO WATCH IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY. which if you haven't where have you been all this time?
Overall: 10",10
"
                Ok the first episode had nothing to do with the original story but it was still great. The reason for it though was probable to get new and old fan exited from the beginning because the original story starts out slow and steady.
Secound episode was nearly all flashback and is the preface to why the brothers are where they are now. though it doesnt happen at the same time the flashback happened in the manga, it remained faithful to it and didnt add/remove anything unessessary.
As a whole, overall these too episode compliment each other really well from a fast too a slow one. Regardless of
                  modifications made to the story I am confident that it will remain to the manga in the long run, unlike the first FMA anime.",10

I've been wanting to write a review on FAB since the dawn of time and i do mean that..Can't even remember when i started taking notes on pieces of paper(yes yes i'm older than the universe and still use paper to write down instead of using technology)and i certainly can't for the life of me bring some order into this chaos..Seriously i have paper scattered all over my desk and now i can't organize it in such a way that it makes sense.
But then again we're talking about FAB and nothing about it makes sense. Nothing can prepare you for the storm of sensations that
                  will hit you as soon as you dive deep into this world of madness and almost unending pain and agony. Every single second that passes watching FAB makes you more addicted to it. This anime is like being on psychotropic drugs, it messes with your brain chemicals and leaves you for absolutely dead after it's done with you.
Now for those of you who are new to the concept of Fullmetal Alchemist this one is a ""remake"" of the anime series that was produced way back in 2003. Now i said remake but there was a big problem with the '03 series. It was being produced while the manga was still going strong. In fact the manga bid us farewell in 2010.. That is a lot of material that the original series could never cover. The only options available to Fullmetal Alchemist was doing an original story or stop it in its rails and wait until the time was right and continue with the project. And as you'd expect with a project that had money thrown in they kept with it and made their own story..
In the equation rides FAB which was a remake and one that would be true to the manga to the end since the manga gave sufficient time for the anime to follow lead. And oh boy did they let the dogs of war loose on this one..
The story is pretty much the same as the '03 one up to a point. The 2 brothers Alphonso and Edward as kids lost their mother and decided to commit the ultimate taboo in alchemy and that is human transmutation which means they tried to bring their mother back from the dead. In doing so Ed loses his arm and leg and his younger brother Al loses his entire body because in alchemy there are rules. To be more specific the rule of equivalent exchange which means to obtain anything something of equal value must be lost. So Ed has one arm and one leg less and Al is now a soul attached to an armour. They're both hired by the government years later as “State Alchemists” and they go on a journey to get their bodies back. 
I would go deeper to explain more about the story but then again i'd have to deploy major spoilers like the ones you'd find on Fast and Furious cars and that would be ridiculous and pointless. That and you can't possibly expect me to break down a Japanese Leviathan God of 64 eps..What i can and shall tell you is that it's a journey you HAVE to take for yourself. 
Maybe i'm exaggerating but the story and the way it's delivered leaves you breathless by how multi-layered it is. You get the whole shebang and sheblow with this one. From loyalty to corruption, to genocide, the journey to find your self while dealing with your past, forgiveness and revenge. It’s a rollercoaster of emotions. I stand by my statement that this is one of the few-if not the only-anime that can manipulate your emotions in the strangest ways possible while keeping you excited in the most primeval way. Every episode is an adrenaline shot straight to the brain.
And now we come to the part where comparisons must be drawn between the 2 approaches and i hope i don't get hunged in the central plaza for my heressy  but i think that in the part where the 2 storylines are the same the '03 version did some things better than this one. Mind you that doesn't say much cause there are too many things this one did so much better.. I think that had to doo with the fact that the writers of FMB were working under the assumption that whoever will watch this must have already watched the 1st one so the skimmed through some fundamental parts way too quickly. Is that a turn off? No...By no means..Sure there's a feeling that something is missing but i can't give 2 shits about it cause after that small part everything starts to take off and it does so in a grandiose way. And whereas the 03 remained in the scope of Amestris this one explored a whole new world while producing balls to the wall action and a plot so huge it that would put Mandigo to shame(Google is your friend)..
The cast is vast. So fucking vast i think listing them all here would freeze the internet for a decade and to be honest i'm not really keen on going back to the stone age where we used some flappy flying rats to deliver messages..I like the internet.. It has free porn in it, did you know?
Back to the characters every single one of them gets their light under the putrid sun.Even characters that had no major role in the overall scheme of things have a purpose and thus get screen time. And while many anime try to do that and fail miserably this one pulls it off in a splendid manner. Nothing and nobody feels left out. And above all the depths to which all of them are plunged into the darkness of despair chills your bones.
And part of that whole atmosphere was the music working in tandem with the visual representation. Many writers of today's anime should take note of how to use the damn music and where..As for VA's almost all of them were perfect except for Al's VA who sounded like a 7yr old child and that kind of ruined the character for me.
The animation is eye wateringly good especially considering how much they had to cram in there..64 eps with scenes of combat ranging from hand to hand to the full monty tanks and whathaveyou..They even took special care to show the difference between the races included.
In the end it's small wonder FM shook the anime industry to its' foundations. Think about it.. Say, you want to show someone unrelated to anime what this world is like. The very first words to pop into your head are Fullmetal and Alchemist. To liken it to the human body if Gintama is the head then FM is the heart and soul. And if you are sitting there thinking about what to watch next and haven't seen this already then drop EVERYTHING and get your sorry ass down and watch this until your eyes bleed cause after all you have to give something of equal value back..",9
"
                With a highly ambitious plot such as this there is always the risk of it becoming overcomplicated to execute. However FMAB was never in the danger of this. 
It is an incredibly well-written story anchored with a great array of characters, almost all of whom has steady series development (I will mention here that Ed's physical growth mirrors his ongoing maturity throughout the show). The plot moves at a good pace; in 64 episodes I can only recall one filler episode (Rush Valley). 
I know almost everyone praises this anime so I'll just focus on some of its weaknesses. One thing I noticed is the
                  ill-timed or rather well-timed comedy value in serious situations. It prevents the show from becoming a runaway drama but at the same time I feel like it takes away the gravity of the situation at hand.
I also feel that with the multitude of characters there is almost always someone who can double up as Deus Ex Machina. There were numerous instances where all hope looks lost to our protaganists if it weren't for the 'very timely' arrival of character A. It just feels like a cop-out whenever that happens.
With these in mind, I still watched it with great enjoyment from start to finish. I have to commend Arakawa for creating a wonderful manga (which I shall start soon, I have to get some books out of the way first!) and Bones for creating this adaptation in the first place.",9

                FMA: Brotherhood is an absolute masterpiece. If you have not watched it then GO WATCH IT NOW! Seriously, go watch it, it really is that good and is one of the few anime's that reached it's level of hype. From FMA's story, characters, artwork, sound, everything and I mean everything is really top notch and damn near perfect. The voice acting is excellent and has an A-list cast, the art looks crisp and beautiful, the action is just amazing, the story has such a large scope and the ending just ties everything up so nicely.
I won't go too much into the story, but the basic
                  premise is that our main heroes are trying to get their bodies back. That does not sound like much, but the story goes so much deeper and explores various philosophical and moral issues about war, human sacrifice, and what it means to be human. FMA's story is just something I can't describe well enough to do it justice. So if you want to know more you'll just have to watch the anime!
The art and sound are both excellent and accompany the anime well. It's pretty much what you expect from a top notch anime. The voice acting is, well perfect.
The characters are all like able, even the villains. The development of the main characters and side characters are all there. It's like a dream come true how much development these characters get. We actually, over the course of the anime, get to know and learn about these characters. From their flaws to there ideals. That's what I miss from a lot of anime because of the episode limitations character development is really the first thing that is lacking in a 12 or 13 episode anime. But with 64 episodes, there is plenty of time for development of both villains and heroes. And the most important thing is that the characters are human, they're not perfect, they have their flaws and that's what makes them like able and so good. 
FMA: Brotherhood is truly a masterpiece, everything that makes up FMA is what any anime fan would dream of. In other words it's perfect. No fillers. No dumb comic relief characters. No fluff. So what are you still doing reading my review! Go watch FMA: Brotherhood now! In fact I think i'll watch it again. 
10/10 in every regard.",10
"
                “Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange.” Edward and Alphonse Elric, two teenagers able to use the Alchemy learned the hard truth.
If you still didn’t watch the excellent and renowned Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMAB), this is to me a must-watch! The anime mixes science through Alchemy, magic, action, adventure and fun in a European Industrial Revolution look-alike world. It might even make you shed some tears. Pay attention though, FMAB follows way more strictly the original manga while his older brother Fullmetal Alchemist does not
                  really.
So for those who have never seen it, go for it!",10
"
                Thanks to Crunchyroll I was able to watch Brotherhood for the first time and am I glad they added it. For the longest time i've heard praise of the highest for this show and it continued to build my interest. Brotherhood truly is one of those perfect shows.
Ed and Al's journey to return their bodies back to normal while encountering foes and fighting their way through with alchemy is an amazing journey full of tears of happiness and cries of pain. I felt connected to the duo as they encounter things that would scar a normal teenager, and quite a few things did scar them,
                  but they moved on.
The characters aside from the brothers are also great with the phenomenal Mustang and lovable Winry, as well as cool Hawkeye. The villains as well based off the seven sins of man were the perfect antagonists to Ed and Al.
The soundtrack fit well with the show and the openings and endings are some of the best I've heard in any show.
Overall Brotherhood is an incredible series that I can't recommend enough. Definitely lives up to the hype.",10
"
                Full metal alchemist brotherhood is my favourite anime of all time. After taking about 3 months away from anime to focus on school, coming back to anime has been a pleasure and there is no better way i could have came back. I will start of with the story, in the first ten episodes it is pretty much identical to the original anime but after that the story starts too pick up pace an slowly become more pleasurable and especial the conclusion.
Next is the art, although it was quite jumpy at times overall the animation was very clean and defiantly had some nice fight scenes
                  which were also beautifully choreographed. I rated it a 7 because it was'n amazing all the time.
I rated sound an 8 because the sound track too the anime was nicely composed but i didn't really like the op and the ep.
I rated the character 7 because all the characters were all beautifully thought out and all in the same scene can lead to some interesting dialogue.
I rated a 10 on he enjoyment because i loved everything thing from the pacing to Edward getting grumpy bout his height. Everything seemed to seem to realistic even though the story is fictional. 
Overall the series was great and everything worked together and i defiantly recommend watching it if you haven't already.",10

                Whats this? ANOTHER Fma? And whats more, the first 15 episodes are almost exactly the same as in the original. Don't get me wrong, storyline and overall quality is great, but the first 15 episodes have more filler than a walmart hot dog. AFTER those episodes though, it really kicks into gear. New characters, in depth understanding on alchemy, etc. It gives a general idea to those who have not watched this, but at the same time gives all new insight on what really happened behind the scenes. Looks to be another 51-52 episode series and each episode gets better by the minute.

                I never realy liked reading long reviews, so I am gonna make it as short as I can. 
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one of the best if not the best anime series existed till now.  The story is a 10, because you have everything you would ever want from an anime. Action, adventure, magic, fiction world, humor, great backstories and nice ships. It 's not too short neither too long, it 's just perfect. You can follow up the story very easily, you see how the characters became what they are just as much as it 's needed. There are not any scenes that
                  you don 't like them and seem like unnecessary. Even if a scene it 's not really needed for plot reasons it's not bad or boring, but adds to the characters develoment or adds a little comedic effect or something, my point is that there is not any scene that yIou will thing ""I don 't like it at all"" or ""It 's too boring"" etc. 
The art is fantastic, especially concindering the production year. The soundtrack is iconic, especially the first opening which is one of the greatest openings of all times in my personal opinion. 
The characters are well-written. Everyone has flaws of course like every person in real life but everyone has their good parts too. The character developtment is at least great. There is not a single one character I think that you can go and say ""It 's trash"" or ""It 's bad-writtain"". Even the villains (at least most of them) are realateable and some of them you just love them. The best thing about the main characters I think is that you don 't hate them and they don 't piss you of, something that I have seen happening to a lot of anime (and in general). 
I really enjoyed watching FMAB a lot. Is something I always recommented to everyone. I think if you are a weeb/otaku/anime fan you should watch it at least once. It was the first anime I watched (not counting the ones I watched as a little kid) and to this day I believe is a must-watch and it 's a great start for anyone who wants to be a part of the anime community.",10
"
                If there was ever such a thing as a perfect anime, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood might be the one. I just finished watching this series and I really cannot think of any major glaring flaws. I still do have a couple unanswered questions but that is to be expected of an anime as complex as FMAB. I watched the first adaptation of FMA years ago and I always felt like I really didn't need to watch Brotherhood because I'd be watching the same thing all over again, but boy was I wrong. I thought the first FMA was good, not great, but I cannot say the
                  same for FMAB. FMAB simply blew me away. The story goes in a completely different direction than the first and I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I forgot about the first series. The only thing FMAB lacks is that background information that you are given in the first series (so I recommend watching at least a little bit of the first FMA before starting Brotherhood). I really didn't know how much I liked Brotherhood until I started watching the last few episodes and realized that this amazing adventure was coming to a close. There have been only a few anime that I have watched that have gotten me truly emotional and FMAB is one of them and that is enough for it to be at the top of my list. At the end I reflected on what the anime had taught me. The common themes throughout this anime are repeated time and time again. Themes like ""in order to gain you must give"", ""in order to grow you must endure and always move forward"" "", ""The strength of many will always outweigh the strength of one"", and ""a human life should never be taken for granted"" are just some of the many that I picked up on while watching FMAB. This show is deep at times, and a little complicated but it is also a story about relationships, overcoming obstacles, courage, determination and other positive characteristics that instill hope and happiness into the viewers. Every character in this anime learns a valuable lesson in one way or another, because they all have their different problems and in effect are able to learn and grow from these setbacks. You will no doubt connect to the characters of FMAB and just like me, you will grow to miss them once you have finished this series. FMAB strength was found in it's stories, stories that we can all relate to and characters that we can root for and sympathize for (and GOAT openings and endings). This anime is #1 for a reason, i'm not saying it's my absolute favorite but it really is a near perfect anime that I have grown quite fond of. I would like to think that I am a reasonable and realistic anime fan, so please take my review seriously because I'm really not one to hype up an anime like its the greatest thing in the world. Hopefully you give FMAB a chance like I did, because I can assure you that you will not be disappointed.",10

                Okay I think this is one of the greatest stories ever even before it was put into anime. After watching the first one ‘Fullmetal Alchemist’, it was good but it did not prepare me for this one which is so much better. I mean it even made me give my first review ever.
The Story is so good. After watching FMA I was really excited by FMA Brotherhood. But it was even better than I imagined. There were no unnecessary parts of the story. No time was wasted on insanely detailed explanations which are not necessary, like must shounen. They spend so long explaining what the
                  kind of assault will be used and all the effects. I mean here the were using alchemy to fight and that was it. The story did not focus on romance which I am grateful for. Most anime and movies in general always add that extra annoying bit of romance to take the story of what is happening.The story revolved around themes that I enjoyed. I really liked the friendship theme. I mean there doesn't have to be that special girl/guy for anyone to function.
The Characters were great. I mean they did not fall into all the cliché ‘good’ guy ‘bad’ guy category. By the end of the series you feel like you have gotten to know the characters.  It was really good. I like the way the characters are real like if you were in that situation you would have done something similar. I was very good. At the end of each episode you know the characters a bit more. The supporting characters were given life which some animes fail to do. The only aspect that is sometimes shown of a supporting character is in relation to what the main is doing. like guy that helped main character x to thing y. and that is all making it easy for you to forget who the supporting characters are a few minutes down the line.
The Art was really detailed the lighting was not gloomy at some parts. You could see a silhouette of one of the characters and known who it was.
The Sound was great. The best kind of sounds during an anime is the kind which you do not notice the song because it comes at the right time where you would like to hear it. The OP and ED were usually nice I don’t like the too frequent changes. I enjoyed the first and last OP the most.
Anyone in their right mind would enjoy this series.  The mix on genre without going to the extremes is done so well. You see genres like action, adventure, shounen, drama, comedy and tragedy (I know at the same time, some parts are completely funny while others kind of serious) and just a tinge of romance. I was very whole some. It was not boring at any single point.
I would give this a perfect 10 overall. And I am very stingy about grades. Whichever way you stumbled on this you should finish reading this and begin watching it. And no, it’s not too long for those of you that like short 25 episode animes.",10
"
                I love this anime with a burning heart. It's the only anime that's ever made me cry, smile, laugh, angered me, and did it in one episode. (It's one of the earlier episodes I'm sure you can guess which one it is for people who've watched it.....) I say this is a MUST MUST MUST watch anime, everything was spectacular about it. My only advice to someone who hasn't watched Full Metal Alchemist yet, is to watch the first 20 episodes of Full Metal Alchemist, then watch Brotherhood because the original Full Metal Alchemsit gets more detailed with the backstory. My only advice I have
                  to offer, otherwise this anime is godlike.",10
"
                While watching, I found myself constantly falling asleep in boredom. It was never really captivating or fully investing. I discovered that when I watched, I was appearing to get dumber. I began to believe in capitalism for the slightest moment before I was able to hold myself at bay. The animation was subpar at best, having moments where I was disgusted at even wasting a minute of my time by watching. There were moments where it seemed that they weren't even trying with the art. There were details lacking in Alphonse's face and armor completely. The story seemed to be barely held together by the
                  idea of getting Alphonse's body back. The voice acting lacked emotion and impact. I could barely focus on anything else because I had to struggle to hear what they were trying to say. The only redeeming quality is the opening song that is a fuccin banger dood. I'd rate this a zero if I had the ability to, however this flawed system doesn't allow for such a score.",1

                Story 
 9.5/10
Edward and Alphonse Elric are two alchemist brothers searching for the legendary catalyst called the Philosopher's Stone, a powerful object which would allow them to recover their bodies (which were lost in an attempt to bring their mother back to life through alchemy). 
The story takes you through the various stage of human nature and make you think deeply about yourself in the process. Since the homunculi in this anime are based on the Seven Deadly Sins, they are able to portray what makes a human a man. 
Animation  9.5/10
Very good animation. The scenes work perfectly with the story line and it's wonderful to watch. 
Also the graphics and art work are much better than the manga (which you usually find in all shonen mangas). 
It's fun to watch and most moments are jaw-dropping.
Sound 
 9.5/10
Suits the mood and scenes perfectly. There are different background musics that are played repeatedly at different moments but all that works well together.
Characters 
 9.5/10
Very original, though a few characters are unnecessary. 
The characters were designed to the role they would play in the anime and though sometimes there are too many of them, they always come back to help with the plot one way or the other.
Overall 
 9/10
I liked that the story was able to express and evoke so many emotions and reflect on sins and desires of being human. 
Very strong and makes you think differently after you watch it.",9
"
                Honestly the pinnacle/benchmark for any anime. Extremely well paced, which i think is what carries it so well. There is never a dull moment, and the transitions between the serious/comedic are superb. The character development is interesting in terms of that it doesnt really focus on ed and al, but on the the people around them, and for such a large cast of supporting characters, many are extremely well developed. The plot is intricate and tight, and the artwork is simple yet elegant. The only think that im not entirely on board for is the soundtrack, which gets kind of repetitive (if you've seen it,
                  you know what i mean), and the (at least to me) outdated ops and eds.",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the Best Anime Ever, Best Story of All Time, Best Animation of 2009, Interesting Characters and Highly Enjoyable. this one is the Best! this Anime Should be Number One! at First i Thought this one wasn't better than The Top 3 Action Anime Titles, but when i watched the First Season FMA (2003) i started to enjoy the anime but not like Code Geass, Which Really has a Great and Interesting Story. but When i Watched FMA Brotherhood, that shocks me that there is an Anime who has a Better Story than Code Geass and Death Note. the Fighting Scenes in
                  FMA Brotherhood is Amazing, but Naruto, Bleach and One Piece has more rich and better fighting scenes, but Overall Fighting Scenes, Story, Animation, Characters and Enjoyment Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood Rocks! for my Opinion Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the Best Anime of All Time and Deserves to be Number One!",10
"
                FMAB is a well animated anime,the music especially for the openings is very good as well;so good that I kinda feel tricked by the openings into watching the anime.
Before anything,I actually only saw a couple of episodes of the fma 2003 on TV by pure coincidence. I believe the episode was the one with the chimera girl which I saw all over the net sometime later.Surprisingly I think that the fma adaptation to that scene is better than brotherhood.
The anime starts well,I believe that the first episode was one of my fav episodes in the entire show (could be my fav but IDK),the water alchemist
                  was a good character and we got introduced to many characters and alchemists along the way.
I liked scar at first as well,mainly his fights with the state alchemists,they were one of the most elegant fights in the entire show despite how short they were. His backstory,how he inherited the arms was kinda cool, despite thinking that the way they made his brother fuse with him, and the circumanstances to it were pretty forced. Now many of you will say ""oh,how dare you!His brother was dying and it was the only way he knew how to save him!"" well I say whatever. I say it's all plot device and I don't care. I guess that's exactly what's wrong with fmab,subjectively,I am not that hard to affect when facing a nice story,but fmab had so much cliché and plot devices that I couldn't care! I swear I could predict the next scene like 70% of the time (or more) which was pretty sad and disappointing.
The story of the Elric brothers was somewhat good but it was mentionned so many times over and over that I got very annoyed of it,not to mention the ED IS SHORT joke which got consumed infinitely. Speaking of jokes,I believe Ed was callled the fullmetal alchemist only so people could confuse him with his borther and so ,the mangaka could use that joke repeatedly during the anime. So yes,I believe the show was named after a try of implying a joke into the story.
Also why do all blond characters look almost the freaking same?
Ed was somewhat of a boring protaganist along with his brother,not to mention his girl friend. I don't remember her name because I barely saw her as a character and more as a plot device,she was very generic that I couldn't consider her as a person.
The supposedly sad moments in this anime are trying so hard to get you sad but they were so cliché that I couldn't really care.""Oh it's raining!It's raining all right!"" Is that supposed to make me feel sad?lol
Cause it was closer to making me laugh
A dad transformed his daughter and his wife into chimeras,I mean that's sad ok,but moving on,it wasn't a strong scene what so ever.There are so many sad scenes and horrible stuff going on out there (in anime and irl) so I have no idea what's iconic about this scene. It really was such a normal scene to me that I didn't care later whether he died or lived. Scar giving her the mercy kill was a nice gesture though.
Moving on,I wanna talk about the fights,I guess that's one of the worst things about this anime.They were so boring to watch at some point,especially the ones including Roy.He just spams fire and that's it.He killed lust and then he killls envy with the same freaking way. Lust at least pulled some moves at first but Envy?The fight was so boring,the mangaka even went into involving that girl with Roy (which I also forgot her name due to her genericness) into the scene, only so they wouldn't move into the killing blow direclty. This just proved to me how much the mangaka lacked creativity and imagination.
It's sad that alchemy was 80% of the time used as earth banding,the first episodes made it look so promising but they just didn't know how to handle alchemy fights right.
I wanna say that Ed was cool a few times during the anime,mainly when he was in the portal or inside gluttony.
And talking about the sins,I guess gluttony had the only interesting death in all the seven sins,kinda felt sad for him tbh as he mentionned lust during his final moments (not sure where I saw his figure before though,he is just so familliar)
I think most of the sins were pretty interesting as characters,even if their deaths weren't anything interesting to me. Tbh greed's first death was better than his final's .
Bradley had one of the best fights despite that his fight with scar wasn't much (cool stab with sword mouth though)
One of the most annoying things in FMAB is the characters pumping out of nowhere. You see the plot going then out of nowhere a kung fu loli,a prince and his 2 ninjas end up interacting with our main characters out of nowhere. I don't care about the succession sub plot,it was a stupid excuse to force random characters into the story.There a lot of random encounters out there but I am not going to mention them all,not to mention the number of characters with little to no development.
Not to mention the thing with greed. Don't get me wrong,I like Greed and Wrath and their interaction(s) but....Our main characters happen to meet Greed,which was a stray for a hundred years and you're telling me that Wrath (or father) decided to collect him and do the operation on that very day from all the 365*100+25 days?????Talk about plot convenience XD
I don't think anyone is reading this far but anyways
I didn't like Van much but his backstory with the dwarf in the flask was pretty nice.The dwarf in the flask was intriguing,I like his troll of a smile.He sounds better than father (I know they are the same person) who always tries to act calm and in control.
The final transformation was pretty epic but the transformation itself was a let down. He does all that and he doesn't end up killing everyone in one single blow?That's disappointing!I was expecting him to nuke everyone at the spot but NO! It had to be that one moment where everyone sides against one commun enemy,while that enemy DEFLECTS/ENDURES all the hits instead of just killing everyone on the spot.Let's go plot armor Yeah!
This anime had potential but it just failed to improve to the next level of Hype.
This anime isn't even near being a master piece!
I don't know much about all the animes out there,but It's sad that this anime is the Icon to Alchemy while I think that it didn't do it much justice. I really hope that a better anime about Alchemy takes its place ,cause the amount of mediocrity I see in it is sad. Hell I played games about alchemy with better plots XD
Credits where it's due. FMAB is a well animated anime with very nice music and a fairly nice concept but it didn't live up to it's potential
I gave it 7/10 if I am being generous
7.5 If I am super ultra generous
but I wouldn't be surprised if anyone gives this anime a 6 or a 6.5
Edit: I just want to say,that I just found out that the 1st episode of FMAB was canon to the anime only. No wonder that the rest of the anime didn't live up to the quality of that episode. Funny how the potentially single best episode in this anime is filler to the manga. I may as well decrease my rating by 0.25-0.5 for that ^^ (would have been nice if whoever made that episode,made the rest of fma 2003)",7

                Story: Every episode is so brilliant and well put together. The backstory of every character is so good. It has greatly detailed plot with unexpected twist and turns, which I really like. (It's straight to the point, no fillers except 1 recap episode)
Art: The art style is very simple, not to flashly but it fits very well in this anime. The fight scenes are incredibly executed especially in later parts of the story. the overall design is very steam punk-y which is really rare nowadays
Sound: VA really portrayed it perfectly, really capture the emotions of each character. Soundtrack was ok, but it didn't have a
                  very big impact on the overall experience
Characters: Characters are so well written, I fell in love every character including the villains. Almost every character, even the supporting characters have their own unique personality and have their own unique story to tell.
Enjoyment: Really enjoyed it, and found it very fulfilling till the end
Overall: I highly recommend it to everyone. Definitely, the most enjoyable anime I have ever watched. Many thanks, to all who got involve in this creating this anime.",10

                Even though the shounen genre may have been overrated sometimes by the anime community itself, and me myself hated it being a repeated concept in the industry, FullMetal Alchemist;Brotherhood showed me what this kind of genre really is capable of. I see shounen as being just non-stop action and hype with main characters generically and always striving to be the best like this or the best like that, while this show isn’t just about a story of an underdog trying to attain something. And hell nor it may have overpowered protagonist where every female bitches is falling inlove with them. And yes, I see this
                  show great as well because its not just about the story of the main characters itself, but as the camera takes you away from the protagonist which are the Elric Brothers, you can see that every character lines on this show is being progressed as if it in a very realistic manner. When one moves, also everyone does. AND I ALSO FORGOT, THIS SHOW HAS THE LEAST BIT OF PLOTHOLES ON IT SO YOU WILL NOT BE TROUBLING YOURSELF FROM ANALYZING EACH BITS OF IT. IN FACT IT’S CLOSE TO BEING FLAWLESS.
Story 10/10
Now the story basically takes place on two brothers, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric committing a forbidden action in alchemy which one must not act, also called as “human transmutation” or reviving someone from the dead. They want to revive their mother, Trisha Elric, who overworked herself because of solitude. They basically tried to commit this taboo and seemingly they receive nothing but a painful punishment; from Edward being taken his legs off and Alphone his whole body. And now the overall goal of the main characters is to basically find the philosopher’s stone which is capable of returning both of their bodies back. Little does they know that this stones has a lot of mysterious components in that makes the story captivating and amazing. From the first episode you can already tell that the story is going somewhere deep and mysterious that every viewer may have not been predicting. The shows starts of a little bit lighthearted and comedic because some of its scenes are animated cartoonishly but as you pass halfway through the series the comedies are being reduced, not abruptly but with ease, and you’ll be starting to wander the world of alchemy. The story is well written not just because of how it transitions its lightheartedness, but also because of its fast paced plotline, the mysteries, the emotions, the satisfaction and most of all, the action. Its just one of those shows blended with other genres as well but staying consistent on its roots.
Characters 10/10
How do you make a nice plot? Well develop a good and consistent character. And FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood exactly does that. If its a villain,then its a villain. If the character is like this, then it won’t change from insignificant reasons. This show does that well that every characters in this show is somewhat significant and engaging with the plot and not a single one of them can be considered as ‘trash’. Not the trash I mean that has poor character but trash as in being disposed. You see one problem of fiction stories here is that they introduce a character and after they fulfill their respective roles on the show they will just be forgotten and disappear like they never exist, you see “TRASH”. While on the other hand, instead of just being forgotten this show made it so that every character is still engaging with one another and not being completely forgotten about. And with that its a big advantage on the show because it made the plot a lot more realistic and lessen a lot of plot holes. And also the bad guys here are very well written. The 6 sins (excluding greed) made it so that every viewer needs to be fulfilled with various kinds of bad guys. And of course the main antagonist was well-written as well clearly stating his ambitions within the show. All in all the characters here were all just great and fantastic.
Ohh.. Here are may favorite characters on the shows.
-Well of course I’ll consider the protagonists, the Elric Brothers, I don’t think I need some explanation in that or some clarification.
-Roy Mustang: Because he has this genius side on him staying true to his dream as the Fuhrer President even though holding immense amount of capabilities he still didn’t use it for something evil.
-Lin Yao and Greed: They made it seem so that being greedy isn’t really a sin.
- Van Hohenheim- who doesn’t like a bad ass father?
Sound 9.7/10
The sounds in this show were clearly also a masterpiece. I’ll divide it into three parts though so that it’s organize, the OST, OP and ED and the voice acting and usage of Sound Effects.
Opening And Ending (10/10)
The 5 Openings was really great and unique that it hit every viewer hard so that they couldn’t forget the show just like that. Each opening has their unique sounds and all were not just generic JPOP Rock, but also something emotional and sad that it can pierce through my heart when watching emotional portions of the show. I love how they made the 5th Opening more soft and not rock as the show is really engaging not just actions and hype but also something more emotional as the show seems to be ending and every character who just suffered in the show will have an end to it. The first opening also has a soft touch to it introducing each characters while rapping but with no flashy instruments used, the rap was intense, but the production was made more like an acoustic and with no EDM beats or something which is really fantastic. The Ending songs was all average to me but they do the job perfectly so I wouldn’t mind it specifically and just give a 10.
OST 9/10
Perfect tracks on perfect moments although nothings new is grabbing me though since all were just doing the job fine but not exceeding my expectations. But I think they were great pieces its just they’re a little bit too bland. But still as I said, perfect timing on perfect tracks.
Voice Acting and Usage of Sound Effects 9.8/10
I wouldn’t mind the Japanese if they made  minor mistakes on voice acting the show, hell even if they do made some mistakes I’ll still be grateful that they’re working hard on this Japanese Cartoons. Well pretty much I don’t see some problem in voice acting in particular but I see some minor flaws on the usage of SFX. The sounds were nicely pick its just the timing sometimes could be a little off. Its just subtle, but I do notice some of it. Many of it particularly the animation of walking not matching the footstep sound effects. But still it didn’t affect the show int the fullest but still I’ll reduce the score for it a little bit.
Animation 10/10
Ahhhhhh! S A K U G A
Enjoyment (10/10)
Do you expect me not to enjoy a well-written action and adventure show incorporated with blending genres and different kinds of emotions with well written characters? Well to be true there may be some point you’ll be bored in the series. Especially some of the flashbacks, but it doesn’t really matter because those are all significant to the plot, its just anybody would always anticipate action on this show and sometimes they don’t give a fuck about the details on how a particular event occured. But still you’ll enjoy it.
OVERALL 10/10
 - WATCH THIS WHEN YOU DON’T HAVE ANY HOMEWORK FOR FIVE WEEKS",10

                Hagane No Renkinjutsuhi (also known ""Fullmetal Alchemist"") is the anime based manga by Hiromu Arakawa, the story styled after the Europan Indiustrial Revolution. Fullmetal Alchemist was serialized in Square Enix's Monthly Shonen Gangan magazine between August 2001 and 2010. In 2009, Bones makes the remastered of Fullmetal Alchemist, the title of the remake is ""Hagane No Renkinjutshui: Fullmetal Alchemist"" or ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" The story of Brotherhood. Brotherhood made the story same with the manga, in fact Hiromu Arakawa told Bones about the ending of the Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Okay i'm want to reviews the story, art, sound, and character of Fullmetal Alchemist although it's
                  not too much. I like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood because the story so logical, the character's art face it's resembles where their lived (Example: Edward's face is like Europan and Ling's face is very looks like eastern).
Story (10/10):
The story of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is closely from the manga, yeah Bones wants to plan for making Fullmetal Alchemist Brothehood story same with the manga to fix the story of previous series (Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)). The storyline of Fullmetal Alchemist is very logical and it's too based in real life historical example the conflict between Amestrian Military with the Ishalan, i look in internet about facts of Fullmetal Alchemist, war between Amestrian Military with the Ishvalan it's based of World War 2. 
The plot of the story, the Elric brothers that is Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric want to revive their mother because their mother passed away because sick and to do that, Edward and Alphonse need to know materials to make people, increase their alchemy ability. Before Edward and Alphonse save their mother (use human transmutation), they trained by their teacher named ""Izumi Curtis"" the training of the alchemy it's so hard than their expected, they must lived in survive in Yorke Island for once a month plus they must dealing with the monster (Maison) from that island (in the Fullmetal Alchemist Brtoherhood there's not scene when Edward and Alphonse dealing with Maison who want to attacks them). and after survival training, Edward and Elric train to increase their alchemy for several days, after that, Elric and Alphonse back to their house to revive theri mother with human transmutation but the result of transmutation is fail because the body to use tranmutation isn't their mother and Edward loses his  left leg while Alphonse loses his body, Edward sacrifice his right hand to saves Alphonse with put his soul into the almunium armor. Several years later after Edward join the military, Edward and Alphonse want to find the way to find a way to turn their bodies back. The plot is good for me, that plot is bit different with the shoune anime and the storyline, the storyline is always connected with the main character's goal because Hiromu Arakawa focused to the purpose of the story than the journey. That's why Fullmetal Alchemist story is short than the shounen anime like Naruto and One Piece. The Philosopher Stone is the main object of the story because Pholosopher Stone can makes Edward and Alphonse's bodies back again but they are reject to use it because the Philosopher Stone it's a stone which made from human, Edward and Alphonse find another way to get their bodies back wihtout use the Philosopher Stone, this is what makes the story very powerful because there's another way to finish the problem although that problem it's so difficult to be completed.
Art (8/10):
Bones was better to makes Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, the art is closely to the manga although the previous version is like too. The art of the Brotherhood is more shine and colorful than the previous Fullmetal Alchemist version (2003). The effect animation of Electric while use alchemy and explosion is bit closely to real life effect. There's no 3D CGI in that anime (i think) from the beginning episode until end. Yeah i think although Bones doesn't have a realistic art but the animation and the effect it's so more better and closely to realistic. 
Sound (8/10):
I think I did not explain much for the sound but the sound is like boom! and bam!, yeah i hear like that because when i watching Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood when scene of explosion and people get punch that sounds like that. The sound of land move (alchemy) and car crash is hear like realistic for me, that sounds was epic and i hype that, Bones made Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood so best.
Character (10/10):
There's more chracter with different race in Fullmetal Alchemist, there's a Amestrian with white skin, Ishvalan with black skin, and Xing like Chinese people. This is like real life people with a different race, this is the part i'm like it because there's not only 1 race of people of this anime, there's rarely anime display characters that different race, company with a very distinctive appearance.
Hiromu Arakawa so smart to makes a character, before makes character, Hiromu Arakawa must know very well the character to be made. See characters from Fullmetal Alchemist with Arakawa's idea: 
-Ishvalan and Amestrian based on Ainu and Wajin from real life people. 
-the reason Edward use black clothes because it use to hide stain oil  from his automail. I think that's useful when Edward battle with his enemy and his enemy didn't know that there's oil in Edward automail  that means Edward got weak and it's usefull too, Edward can wash his black clothes easily because he washing just to scent his clothes.
-Alphonse's nickname ""Al"" is chemical symbol for almunium because his armor made from almunium.
-The members of military are named after an aircraft like P-51 Mustang, E-2 Hawkeye, Douglas A-20 Havoc, Breda B-65, Nakajima Ki-84 hayate, etc. I think the reason Arakawa named them because they are the military and their suits like army Air Force.
-The reason Edward short because his energy keeping Alphonse alive. Edward and Alphonse's are linked through the gateway of truth. Edward eats is also being used as energy for Alphonse's body.
But there's a weird thing that Edward hates milk but he likes Stew it maybe that Edward hates things what is issued by the cow.
Yeah this is my first reviews in MAL, sorry that this reviews it's not too much but i wonder you can understand with my reviews, thank you.",10
"
                I guess people on MAL need to go through this step when watching anime. Watching the top rated anime on the website. I think it's been this way for 8 years now, and definitely not deserved. But that's a community matter, let's talk about the damn show.
From what I've seen, FMAB is an anime that has been overwhelmingly praised, with very little hate. My stance on it? A good story, although it fell off pretty bad at the end of it. Might have spoilers, might not, I write these on the fly.
Through the first half of the show, it pretty much follows what I consider
                  to be ""perfect storytelling"" which is, a series of fairly meaningless arcs to give the viewer an understanding of the world before the threads of the plot form a more coherent main story. And then comes the second half, which I put somewhere during the whole Briggs fortress visit, which is honestly my favorite part of the show. This second part is basically a massive build-up for the final fight, while still keeping bits of the mystery solving from the first part.
And then comes the real problem, the final fight in question. On its own, it would probably be a 4/10, everything before was rendered useless, since the major hindrance the bad guys faced was something that, while slightly foreshadowed, happened off-camera.
Also, the main character, or even the main cast for that matter was utterly useless in the fight against Homonculus. Just because Ed threw some punches and dealt ""the finishing blow"" doesn't mean that the whole battle wasn't carried by someone who appeared in the latter half of the anime. Sure it's realistic, but that's the problem. Realism shouldn't get in the way of a good story. Also, almost every death was stupid and easy to avoid, almost feels like the goal was only shock value.
Of course, the rest of the show was praise-worthy. I really enjoyed the world building and basically everything that revolved around combat. The fighting moments looked good, the power system, while simple, did a very good job and the internal political intrigue -which plays the main role in the show, even more so than the actual battling- was the best aspect of the anime.
And of course through the political intrigue in this military dictatorship, the characters really shone. Honestly, there hasn't been a single bad character, although my preference goes to Scar. Speaking about Scar, he's the most minor criminal in a pretty big offense from the show. Along with the whole Xing cast, he's part of those characters who had no business in the grand scheme of things. And while the author did a decent job explaining what Scar was doing, tf were the Xing guys doing? Ling gang and May were both self contained stories in the greater narrative.
The Elrics, Mustang and the Armstrongs all have some sort of stake in the story. But the Xing gang only cared about immortality and just happened to be strung along the whole thing and just happened to fill a few important roles, regardless of how desperately the author tried to string them with certain characters. Maybe it seems too harsh, but I couldn't help but think: ""What are these guys doing here?"" My theory is that the author wanted to expand upon the world with spin-offs and the likes but never got around to doing it.
Also, mind if I use this paragraph to congratulate Armstrong (Alex) for being the only big guy who's purpose wasn't to show how much stronger another character is? That's it thanks.
With all that being said, this remains a real solid anime, and while the top position isn't really deserved to me, it remains a really good shonen. Even more so when there's more political intrigue than there is battling. This is how I enjoy an anime. Very grateful to the creator for that. But a bit less for the fact that it's still not canon that Scar's name is Jugenmujugenmugokonosurike kaiaiusugesugematsufunfaimatsufunraimatsukurune tokoronisumiyapparikojiyappankoji baibobaibobaiboshuringashuringanugurindai guindainobomboribombonanojoukyuumechousuke",7
"
                This is my first review, so please consider that when reading this.
This is, by far, the best anime I have seen to date.
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was the first anime I watched.  I had not watched the original, and still haven't come round to it yet, but Brotherhood was all I needed.  I highly enjoyed this anime from start to finish, and there were very few elements of it I disliked.
The first thing that grabbed me was the humorous elements to the story.  Not a lot of people I know like this as such, but I believe that a little bit of comedic
                  value makes the storyline fun and interesting.  
The second thing was the characters. Edward, the short tempered little runt, has a very unique character to him, which is what I fell in love with at first.  And then you have Alphonse, the more sensible of the siblings, with a sweet and loving personality - and then Roy Mustang, the confident Colonel with an ambition to become the Fuhrer.  Each one of these anime characters has a unique personality; provoking emotions towards them, which just shows how well made the characters are.
The third was the awesome storyline.  It starts off funny and then gradually gets serious as it progresses, and the twists and turns in the storyline which surprise you and make you want to watch even more.  Every element of the storyline I love.
The fourth was the art.  The art is clean and detailed, and my favourite part of it is the detail in the battle scenes.  Never have I been so impressed.  Brilliant.
The only thing I marked down on this one was the sound, however I did give it a high score of a 9.  This was only because the OST tracks further on in the anime were a little repetitive.  Nevertheless, the music enhances the anime, especially some of the music during the epic battles.  Also, the openings and endings are great.  But that is only my opinion.  Some people like, some people don't like.  It is different for every person.
I'll say it again, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the best shounen anime I have watched.  Watch it, you won't be disappointed.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, that is the name of the anime that should be widely  regarded as one of the, if not the BEST anime of all time.
Much unlike its predecessor Fullmetal Alchemist, Brotherhood stays true to the work of art written buy Hiromu Arakawa. With that said, by no means am I putting down the original Fullmetal Alchemist series.
The character development in this anime is stellar. Every relationship, be it comedic, emotional, or anything else, is well crafted and developed through to perfection, leaving no holes. 
The sound, the music. Brotherhood does a spectacular job at setting the mood for every episode that follows
                  through the opening theme. From the first opening through to the fifth and final opening, the mood is set to perfection, getting us ready for what is to come. 
With an art style that is very easy on the eyes, Brotherhood really is the pinnacle of all that is anime, setting the bar for every other series to come both Shonen and non Shonen alike.
From the moment you are introduced to Elric brothers (Edward and Alphonse), all the way through to the magical journey that is Brotherhood, this anime will leave you speechless, and wanting more.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood really is in every sense of the word a god among animes.
With perfect character introduction, a perfectly layered and in-depth storyline, and a perfect ending, Brotherhood is well deserving of a rating equally perfect. Bravo Ms (Mrs?).Hiromu Arakawa!
Rating: 10/10",10
"
                I feel this is overrated, but then I try to think about shows that are better and there aren't many that are on its level.
I watched the first version of FMA and didn't get into it as much.  Brotherhood has it all for an anime, its very addictive, dark but not too dark, and deep but not deep enough to drown.  
The story is interesting and stays true to its premise and magical system, almost to the point of ad nauseum.  The art is consistent, the sound is better than average and the characters are very, very solid.  Not over the
                  top personalities, but memorable.
It has enough intrigue and pacing to keep it interesting and enough action to make it marathon worthy. Highly recommended, but would caution going into with high expectations.  I don't feel as if this anime does anything particularly amazing, but it does everything well.",9
"
                The story had some original and worthwhile elements. But is that good enough to label a story good? I don't think so. I'm at part 4 now, and I doubt my opinion is going to change based on the ending.
The anime foreshadows how things are going to turn out beforehand, and if you are an experienced anime watcher, then you can predict %90 of what is going to happen. From the fakery of Hawkeye's death to Scar's abducting of Winry being a ploy, I was able to predict many of the events taking place. 
The MC is an annoying little brat that we are used
                  to seeing so many times. He is clumsy, insecure about his height, emotional and morally patronising. He is supposed to be the equivalent of a Major who had tons of childhood trauma, and yet he is incredibly well-adjusted in his own way and tries to avoid violence and destruction, even if it serves his interests or even if it makes perfect sense from a conventional morality viewpoint. 
Corollary to what I said about the MC, character development is an utter joke in this anime. Every character is a trope that we have seen millions of times. Not a single original thing about the characters exist. Just examine Winry's behavior, from her cliché expression of her love towards the MC by being a tsundere to her forgiving Scar for killing her parents, every single thing about this character is a cliché. 
Edward fighting that automail guy at Briggs Fortress is another example of a cliché. Instead of showing his badge and quickly avoiding the misunderstanding, Edward says the most braindead useless verbal diarrhea imaginable, as if him being targeted by his own army member is no big deal. The stupid soldier instantly attacks him instead of asking for his credentials so no misunderstanding can take place. This is what I'm talking about. I simply can't stand the MC who despite being a soldier cannot follow even the most rudimentary line of logic and is in a state of constant moral outrage. B-O-R-I-N-G.
The art is fair. It matches the story well, and I especially enjoyed Briggs fortress. The uniforms also match the story quite well. Art is probably the best aspect of this anime, the original elements of the story are captured quite well.
As for the music, could've been better. no song stands out in its own, but no song is painful to hear either.
As for enjoyment, at this point I'm basically forcing myself to watch the anime just to get to its ending. The amount of unnecessary scenes/dialogues make the anime nauseatingly boring. The show is packed to the top with clichés and tropes that I have seen many times. Overall this anime is highly overrated for no good reason.
Update: I have finished the anime. Because the build-up took so long, a lot of stuff went unexplained, which is my kind way of denoting the lazy writing. 
The ending was pretty much how I expected it would be.
The ending was rushed and unfulfilling. The battles didn't make sense, as someone who loved the battles of HxH, this was very feeble in my opinion.
This is the most generic shounen anime you could ever watch. I think a lot of the good reception towards this anime stems from the fact that this anime is one of the first anime people ever watch.",5

                “Even when our eyes are closed, there’s a whole world out there that lives outside ourselves in our dreams.” - Edward Elric
It is amazing how this masterpiece is so complete in every way. Really deserves the top 1 of MyAnimeList and even deserver the title of best anime ever. 
The initial premise is simple, basically it is the story of two brothers who after an accident involving alchemy they seek for the philosopher's stone in order to recover their bodies. However, the interesting thing is that the story develops in a spectacular way, creating several interesting mysteries, including involving politics. The character development is great.
                  All the characters are developed in a unique and exciting way, so much so that the maturation not only of personality but also of ideals is perceived, which makes us feel appreciated by the majority. The fights and animation are spectacular. The ending is also fantastic.
In the end, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a great journey. An amazing history with shocking plot twists. There is no coiling between arcs and loose ends. Therefore, It can be said that FMAB is perfect, an anime highly recommended for everyone.",10
"
                Loved the unique story and the fact that every character had a meaning till the end. The story was interesting and funny at the right times. 
When i started watching the show i already liked Ed's character and wanted him to become stronger. But that didnt really happen. In the whole anime i felt like he wasnt that strong and it anoyed me. 
Thats why i hate the ending of the anime.
 *SPOILER* 
I get the story behind him losing his powers but that just wasnt the ending that i wanted and it annoys me. 
*END SPOILER*
So i give this anime an 8 because i
                  loved the anime only not the ending of Ed's character.",8

                Let me pose a question. Say you were placed in a position where your family structure was ravished, and did one of the worst things possible the the one you hold dear? 
If you answered become a dog of the army, then I welcome you to second attempt at an anime adaption of Hiromu Arakawa's manga Fullmetal Alchemist, the brilliant Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.
The anime ran from 2009-2010 so its a rather fresh one on the scene in terms of that which is to be titled ""classic."" Directed by Yasuhiro Irie and adapted for the screen  by Hiroshi Ōnogi, this is definitely something to take
                  off your never-endingly growing list of suggestions and to take on immediately as your next  marathon.
There are a total of 64 episodes so get ready. This is about to be a journey, which unlike the unceasing longer anime, where the filler is a frequent as story; will be uninterrupted by episodes which make machette qielding maniacs go on reaping sprees in your local corn fields.
For those who don't like corn, imagine wheat.
The story is one of a classic. The quest for the redemption and more. Thought in many ways this show is all too unique on this point. The twists keep popping up, but not in the manner which makes one feel like wanting to hear Vogon poetry. They are honestly flowing with the story, and do not feel like they are there for the sake of merely extending this story to the point that you forgot how it even started. Within the borders of the genre it is an honestly encapsulating story, and beyond the base structure true genius. The detail that Arakawa went to in terms of some of the theory to the world itself is uncanny at points. For this an more, the story would be insulted to its very core to receive less than a 10/10
As for the characters, little is to be said. They have amusing traits. Endearing traits. You can connect with them, despite the fact they exist in a world so different from our own, and you honestly care what happens to them. It has everything that a character should, and so receives a thorough 9/10
The art and sound however I have little to say about. Neither good nor bad. There is nothing all to noteworthy about it, and this is what makes it so special. The most important factor to this piece above is the story it bears, and not its visual play. By not overbearing the story, nor detracting from it the art and sound truly do their roles. Earning them a solid 7/10 and 8/10 respectively.
To those at home who’ve bore with my review as above which is lie more than a rant on how much I’ve appreciation for the given story of this anime, and how much I enjoyed it; I’ve but three words. Just watch it. There is no maybes in the world of indifference. If you merely throw it on the exponentially expanding “to watch” list, it will become lost and perhaps even never seen.
Commit yourselves to a show that’s to be a true marathon tempter, it got me.
Overall I’d love to give it more than a 9/10, however 10/10 implies perfection for a complete mark. This anime is far from perfect, there are times for example, when the pacing, especially in the last two seasons got on my nerves. However I wouldn’t be preaching if I hadn’t enjoyed it so. Give the anime your time, and in my opinion, if you’ve not seen it yet, you’ll wonder how you hadn’t.",9
"
                It is epic and quite possibly one of the greatest tv shows (not just anime) I have had the pleasure of watching. Because of the excellent character, plot, themes, action, and humor. It has heavy themes of WW2 europe and other things. If you know history, you will apreciate this story. No filler episodes, very few characters that I did not like, plus an itch that was screaming to figure out what was this conspiracy. When you get the answer, its shocking. This is for the people who have not watched the original. If you have, you will not be dissapointed despite the differences. Plus
                  close to maybe zero plotholes and unique anime that I havent seen anywhere else. Even the english dubbed voice acting is excellent. Regardless of your opinion of the show, this is one of the shows that got me into anime and I recommend it to everyone.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood shows beautiful depth in its narrative as it depicts two brothers that are both morally compromised and broken, the story follows their redemption quest as well as their coming of age in a world that is truly flawed and not too dissimilar from our reality. 
what seemed as a slow start with the first few episodes quickly was abolished as you the viewer is sucked into a story of political corruption, world domination and endless sacrifice. FMAB essentially questions the true value of human life and the sheer cost and ramifications of sacrificing human souls. Hiromu Arakawa has created something truly inspired
                  by real life events, the connection to the first and second world war is prevalent as she depicts campaigns of carnage orchestrated by human military and organisations from our past, particularity since the anime's setting mirrors a country similar to 20th century Germany. 
Despite the heavy political undertones Ed and Alphonse (Al) resemble the light of hope in a world destined for damnation, they represent the potential of youth and the power of innocence and determination. Both of them are equally as serious as they are unique and hilarious. Ed is insecure and hot tempered but loyal as well as focused. Al is the opposite he resembles happiness and serenity he favours calm tactics to overcome enemies and achieve his goals. Essentially they are a metaphor for the lore of equivalent exchange, they are Ying and Yang, neither of them can exist without the other and that's what makes them and their journey so special and unique. 
Aside from our protagonist's the supporting cast are truly suburb and most importantly likable. they all serve their purposes perfectly, whether it is the hope and determination that Col. Mustang shows, the loyalty of Major. Armstrong and Riza Hawkeye or the love and compassion Winry shows. These supporting characters along with the countless others have satisfying development and never feel underwhelming or worthless. 
Even the Villains are superb, Although the primary antagonists motives may seem a little black and white they are justified in the stories conclusion and what made me love the writing of this anime even more was how much damn empathy I felt for the villains, they had moments in the story where I utterly hated them, however, I always felt somewhat hollow and sad upon their departure, This is a rare feeling not many stories I follow capture, you truly realize that the villains are all missing something they want and that's where you feel empathy for them. 
To round things up FMAB is a surprisingly heavy and dark journey, Sure the over the top and silly animated moments that are purely Japanese can feel out of place initially, but upon reflecting back they are what help to break up the seriousness of this anime bringing in needed moments of humor and they remind you this is a narrative that can not take itself so seriously when necessary.
If you like a fantasy anime with hard magic systems great plot and character development this is a must watch, its dark shonen worth you time.
I don't hand out 10/10 scores regularly and even though there are a few things a little bit off in this anime its overall execution is brilliant and worth a perfect score. Critically it would sit at a 9/10, however, this story left me feeling truly changed and for that it is a masterwork.",10
"
                Okay, I'm of two minds when it comes to this series. For starters, FMAB has an OBJECTIVELY better ending than the 2003 adaptation-I mean, there's no arguing that the ending to 2003 SUCKED, you just can't do it. And FMAB is definitely prettier to look at and has awesome music and all this stuff, and of course, IT FOLLOWS THE MANGA (yes, I'm poking fun at you, manga-purists)...but that doesn't make it perfect, by any stretch of the imagination.
One of the things that I really didn't like about this anime was the pacing-at least, for the first twelve episodes or so. Maybe it's just because
                  I watched the 2003 version first and literally started watching Brotherhood only a couple of days after finishing the first anime, but the first major story arc of this show felt SOOOO weird in terms of pacing. It literally felt like half of the first anime's plot condensed into a few episodes, and you might like that better, but for me, it didn't really work. The first set of episodes just felt really rushed imo, and even though the plot was fast, it didn't really pick up until later because it was just retreading the same ground that 2003 walked on. Once it gets to the introduction of Ling and a few other characters that weren't in the original anime, however, it definitely gets better and more watchable for fans of the 2003 version.
Another thing I don't like are the villains-for the most part. They're all pretty one-dimensional, cardboard cutout villains who are just evil for the sake of being evil...with two MAJOR exceptions. One thing that 2003 did better than Brotherhood (at least in my opinion) was making you CARE about the villains, to the point where you didn't want some of them to die. Brotherhood? Aside from the two exceptions I mentioned (which I won't name here in order to avoid spoilers), they didn't really accomplish that.
Now let's get onto what it did RIGHT, because remember-I still REALLY like this anime. (Though it will always be my 2ND favorite behind the original FMA) For starters, it handled the ending a lot better than the original adaptation, and, of course, it followed the manga, not that I really care. (That's NOT why I prefer Brotherhood's ending, btw. I just like that it's a lot more happy and satisfying than the ending to the original anime) It also had some really awesome fight scenes-like, no joke, they were amazing. It also had like, ZERO filler in my opinion, which cant be said for the 2003 version (which literally had an entire episode dedicated to showing us the collapse of a village caused by a deadly plague that had NOTHING to do with the actual story other than the fact that the main characters happened to be heading there to meet someone that didn't have an impact on the story anyway), so it definitely gets a thumbs up from me for that.
To sum things up, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is more Fullmetal Alchemist, and for that I love it. It retold the story, added fun characters from the manga that didn't make it into the 2003 version due to them not existing at the time, it had a better ending, and it put a new coat of paint on one of my favorite franchises. That being said, while I REALLY LOVE this show, I think it's INCREDIBLY overrated, and I heartily recommend that you watch the 2003 version BEFORE Brotherhood. If you watch Brotherhood first, you'll most likely be put off by the original version once you try to go back and watch it, and I personally believe that in order to fully enjoy Brotherhood, you need to have at least seen a significant portion of the original.",9
"
                I'm one of those people who has watched the first 'original' anime before I even read the manga. To be honest, the first one had that eerie, hung, and incomplete feeling--like some one said that the first one ""didn't sit well with me"".
I totally agree to that. 
As soon as I finished the first one, I started reading the manga and found myself getting more and more sucked into the world of the Elric brothers. I started comparing the original to the manga.
All I have to say is I'm unbelievably thankful that they decided to re-do it; MORE closely related to the original text not
                  just what some animator thought up. It's the author's (Arakawa's) work and was no one else's.
I loved the anime and the manga (being virtually similar and all...). I loved how (in this one) you get to see more of the personal/emotional aspects of EACH character in the story, as opposed to just the quick overall of what's going on with the journey. 
I really REALLY loved this anime with its twists and turns that you may NEVER expect to happen.",9
"
                What's there to say that hasn't been said already? This is, is truly a masterpiece. That's a word that has lost a lot of meaning in recent years. With everyone seemingly labeling every above average show as a ""masterpiece."" But when you actually find one that is, suddenly, that word isn't nearly enough of a praise. This is the first, and only show to date. That I've given a perfect score of 10/10 across the board. 
In every aspect, from the story, to the openings/ending, the characters, to the attention to detail, and art. Everything is classic. I remember 2012, being a 14 year old.
                  And seeing this show for the first time. This was one of the first anime i'd ever watched. I'd have 3 tabs open, each with the next episode. Just so I wouldn't need to press the next episode button. Watching this show is one of the best memories of my childhood I have. That in itself says more than any words ever could about the quality of this show.",10
"
                Wow!Just wow I love this more than any other anime maybe its because the one i watched but I recently watched it again and yet I love Like it the most.Being an anime Fan I have watched alot but none come near it.I can name many anime which i think are great and I think are awsome However my one true anime is this epic master piece.
These are my reviews Many will contradict with it.
I have great respect for One piece and Berserk.but the only think then comes close is the Hunter X Hunter 2011 series.Where to start 
Full metal has great story great chracter
                  design great animation But the best thing is it was not prolonged it had a great ending the best i have seen in anime.I can name so many more great anime which were destroyed by there ending.And no fillers Oh MG I hate fillers in anime just for the sake of prolonging the anime.No other anime had more impact on me than Full metal alchemist brotherhood.Nothing comes near it.It is the best I have seen.It was every thing It had everything It is one of best action comedies one of best adventure animes One of best Thrillers THE best shonen Anime with the best endings and The best Animes Ever I have seen.",10
"
                What can I say? This is one badass anime. Transforming stuff? Break things down and rebuild it into sometime more awesome?
Well, the story revolves around 2 young boys. They aren't your regular joes, they are alchemists. ""An alchemist can be defined as a profession/person that practices alchemy which is the quest of searching for a way in which to turn copper and other metals into gold."" Wait. They aren't just regular alchemists.. that would be boring. They got their nickname, Fullmetal Alchemist for a reason.
Edward(older brother) and his younger brother, Alphonse are missing some parts. Edward missing one hand, a leg and Alphonse missing his
                  whole body!
Edward replaces them with mechanical limbs while Alphonse's soul is controlling a suit of armor.
So the two goes on this crazy adventures battling bad guys. I don't want to ruin it for ya, of course.
Story: It's a really good written story. Unique and have a strong base.
Art: The battle scene are really well drawn.
Sound: Are pretty good.
Character: The characters were developed quite good, each with different attitudes and views. 
Enjoyment: Well I never got bored, and it does catches you by your mouth, making you want more.
Overall: Story - 8, Art - 8, Sound - 7, Character - 8, Enjoyment - 9.
A grand total of 8/10.
I would recommend this, if you're into a bit of humor, action and tiny speck of romance.",8
"
                While I don't think this is amazing, I do think that it is a very good show with some noticeable flaws.
The biggest flaw with this show is the tone. For example, when SPOILER is turning into a SPOILER and it should be a very sad scene for Edward, Shao May shows up and is sad about how short Edward is. This really takes you out of the experience.
Another flaw is the characters. Now, please don't get mad at me, but I only found a few characters to be truly great: Ling, Greed, Wrath, Scar, and Hohenheim. Edward and Alphonse, along with the other Homunculi (maybe
                  excluding Pride), Winry, Pinako, etc. just got a little predictable. They were still good characters, but I didn't think they were amazing.
The animation is serviceable, but not exactly great or anything. Just sorta... there.
The story is my one of my favorite parts of this anime though. It keeps throwing twists and turns at you that you never saw coming.
The sound is serviceable as well.
Besides a slow start, after episode 3 I was hooked. I thoroughly enjoyed this series.
My favorite part of the series was Ling and Greed though. Honestly some of my favorite characters in recent memory.
Overall, I would recommend this show if you just wanna have some good fun and some light takes on faith, science, ideology, and sacrifice. 
Overall: 8.2/10",8

                -Are you tired of all these battle shounen cliches and overused tropes?
 -Are you tired of neverending stories that drag to absolute garbage as time went by?
-Are you tired of the same repetitive formula of training then fighting the bad guy then training to defeat the next bad guy?
-Are you tired of teenagers yelling the name of their technique each time they use it and pull power ups out of their asses with no explanation given other than nakama power?
-Are you tired of underdeveloped interesting side characters that get overshadowed by the boring main character?
if so ,then you should watch FMAB and this is why:
1-it
                  has one of the most intriguing plot in anime that grow more complex as the story progress at first it look like a diconnected events and stories but as the story progress all these plotlines will come together to form a much bigger scene,it will surprise you with its turns and twists that will drop your jaw.
2-the characters are likable and interesting from the vengeful scar to the cunning mustang to the playful hughes to the mysterious hoenheim,the elric brothers aren't your typical shounen lead who knows only two things to do which are eating and training, Edward uses his brain to understand what's going on and relys on tactics more than brute force and he didn't get any power ups during the series  (except if you consider replacing his broken prosthetic arm a power up) then he got three powerups during the entirety of the series ,the last thing I have to add is that all the supporting cast get developed and fleshed out ,all of them  have their moments to shine ,by the end all of their character arcs get resolved in a satisfying way.
3-it has the most important thing for a shounen which is an intense fights,FMAB doesn't hold back in this department ,you will know how intense these fights when it take a bunch of supporting characters and dozens of soldiers to just disarm one of the villains , this series has some of the most badass fighting I've watched,the most enjoyable  are the  ones that involve wrath,mustang and scar.
4-it tackles heavy and dark subject for a shounen like genocide and ethnic cleansing ,political corruption, terrorism and experiments on human subjects.
So why 8 /10 instead of 10/10 because the show isn't perfect it suffers from many issues that may be a turn off for some people which is :
1-the comic relief and the humour is so childish and silly that would hardly make you laugh even worse it make a drastic tonal shift that ruined the dark atmosphere of the series. 
2-the pacing of the first 13 episodes is soo rushed that make you wonder what's going on it felt like random adventures that has nothing to do with each other (at first) this weak beginning would be a challenge for some people patience so if you could make it through these episodes then trust me you won't regret that. 
3-although FMAB didn't fall for many overused tropes in the genre it still fell pray for some other tropes like drama that crosses to the melodrama territory (the elric brother tragedy was weak and i didn't give a damn about them)or the dumb ""killing is bad"" philosophy even when the villain deserves to be crushed under your boot like a an insect and guess what the ones who defend this philosophy are a hypocritic hero who previously choked a soldier to death and a sniper who killed people by dozens during the war, oh I almost forget one of the most important supporting characters suffer from what I call vegeta syndrome (if you know what I mean).
Don't let that hold you back from watching this awesome series there's a good reason why it's number 1 on MAL because it's the best shounen ever made .",8
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is truly an amazing anime. It feels like somebody watched Fullmetal Alchemist proper and said, ""That was good, but it could be even better."" Then they made changes in all the right ways. You want an anime with humor, action, love, unique characters, great world building, and interesting twists and turns, then FMA Brotherhood is for you. Just like everything great, there will be haters, giving it 5's and 7's but thats just not the case. Its not my favorite anime but it is indisputably one of the greatest adventures ever created. There is something for everyone in FMA Brotherhood, and is
                  truly a fantastic ride from start to finish. Dont miss it.",9
"
                It’s great, but is not in the top tier of anime shows. I still believe that it is a classic and must be watched by anime newcomers, but it is not a near-flawless show.
Starting with the good, The animation is fantastic and has aged very well. The music and sound design are very good and there is great world-building throughout the series. 
But the greatest aspect is the story. You can tell that it was entirely thought out before it began and it shows as characters progress through the story. While this may be a shounen like Hunter x Hunter, Naruto, etc., it never feels
                  as if the show is separated into arcs. What I mean by this is that the story flows naturally instead of feeling choppy from many resolutions for numerous arcs. This keeps the show from feeling repetitive and gives it an epic feel that makes the end more rewarding. 
My flaws for the show mostly revolve around the characters and humor. The way most of the characters are presented in the show are: 
1. Introduce character that is instantly appealing 
2. Show tragic backstory that gives some insight into their actions 
3. Maybe give a little more development as needed by the story. 
The result is that the characters never feel real. Instead, they just become understandable for the purpose of progressing the story. Furthermore, the writing for minor characters can be pretty eye-rolling, with them saying over-the-top evil lines so the audience will instantly know that they are bad. 
In addition to this, another gripe I have with the show is the humor. While it isn’t awful, a decent amount of it misses, so it helped that the humor seemed to decrease as the show went on. 
All this being said, I still believe that FMAB is a great show and a classic, but I do not believe it deserves to be considered the greatest anime of all time. 
It is closer to an 8 than a 10.",9
"
                I went into this anime thinking that it must be the best show of all time because of its glowing reviews, expecting nothing less than a definite top 5 anime that is memorable for all eternity. Maybe this is why it was such a disappointment for me.
Story: 8
The story ends up being very good once i had watched it all, i can look back and say that yes there are good moments throughout this series. The problem is that for me was that it takes WAY TOO LONG to tell the story, probably 30 out of the unbelievable slog of 64 episodes could be completely
                  removed and you wouldn't miss anything important, especially in the beginning where really nothing of importance seems to happen for about 15 episodes, its just introductions of characters while the story has not really even started yet (properly). But in the end when the pieces fall together i can sort of forget (actually i think i really just did) the empty parts and piece together a good story.
Art: 3
The art style can not be described as anything other than simplistic, static and just plain detail-less. Every scene consists of an obviously hand-painted static background with the characters being animated with 10 polygons and 3 colors, boring and just not fun to look at. I get that it was made in 2009 but im watching and reviewing this in 2020 and its just dreadful to watch. The animations are good and fluid, its just the drawings that are pure piss.
Sound: 3
I cannot remember a single piece of memorable in-scene music from this anime, not a single one. That to me is a glaring issue since music can really elevate an already good scene into something that can never be forgotten. Sadly this is not the case and i have forgotten most of it. Sounds and voice-actors are good, just not great and the lack of music makes it a huge turnoff.
Character: 7
The different people and story lines are nicely put together in the end with some great character development in between. This is one of the better features of this show and ties in greatly with the story part, but it too suffers from the unreasonable runtime of 25 hours.
Enjoyment: 4
I had been told by many people that this is their favorite anime and that ""pretty much anyone"" will love it, well i kept watching around 1 episode a week because i really didnt feel like watching and kept wondering when the good parts start. The good parts did start at the latter half of the series but didn't last for long. It was one good episode in a bunch of 4 background slow slogs. It took me literally months to watch because i kept doing other stuff and had to find excuses to watch this, i kept telling myself it will be fantastic but it just wasn't. I think the feeling of having my time wasted is an unforgivable sin in anime and this is what i mostly was left with for the majority of the episodes.
Overall: 7
Maybe i should rate this lower since my average score of the components is at 5 instead of 7, but i think this is where this sits well. I can look at the better parts and know that i did watch a good story and fondly remember the better parts. BUT ultimately my time was mostly wasted, i would have rather just watched something else.
TLDR: IMO its a waste of time and is nowhere near ""the best anime of all time"" that many people call it out to be.",7
"
                I don't know what to say about this. I love this franchise so much. The manga and the first anime were the things that got me into Japanese animation. Hell, I'd even go as far to say it's the first time I've seen animation used for more serious storytelling. It had a big impact on me growing up, and I've seen both iterations of the series too many times. While I'd say watch the first anime before this one, if you wanna watch only one, go with brotherhood. Brotherhood has incredible animation, perfect pacing, a well woven story and great characters. However, the adaptation isn't
                  perfect. I don't like how brotherhood handles it's humor. It's not so much it cuts over a serious moment, it's more like it disrupts the story a little too much to do a gag that usually doesn't land. This isn't a problem for the first anime or the manga. I also found the first season to be pretty rough at adapting the stuff that was told in the first anime. It went by stuff too quickly and didn't handle things as elegantly as the first anime did, but it picks the hell up in the later seasons where it's telling newer stuff. Honestly those are my only two gripes and I dont think they ruin my overall enjoyment of the adaptation. It's one hell of a ride and I think anyone with an interest in anime should give this a shot.",10
"
                I know I've gone on record stating that I felt like Elfen Lied was the greatest anime of all time.... And it's in the Top 3, no doubt.... But I can't just ignore the initial reason I got into Anime to begin with, and that is midnight showings of FMA(The original series, that I thought was good at the time....).
Brotherhood is similar to the first FMA series, lot of the same characters, although there a some completely new, and the premise is almost the same, the retrieval of Ed and Al's original bodies. What changes is Brotherhood follows the storyline of the manga almost perfectly,
                  the main villain of the story-from the weakling Dante to the Mad almost God-like Father,  Wrath and Pride are different people, and Winry is a little more.... Woman-like? You'll get the picture....
Bottom line, Brotherhood is a darker, more serious, more deadly series in my mind. I never quit wanting to know who the next more powerful Homunculi would be, or if we would finally see Father, see Ed and Al's father, if the boys would get their bodies back, if Scar would ever be stopped, if Mustang would ever avenge his friend....
There's one thing in the series that I wish wouldn't have ever taken place, but it had to-FMA:Brotherhood ended. The ending was great, it gave closure, and the Final Battle was an all ought assault that left a piece of Central Destroyed and a body count on both sides, so it didn't disappoint, but I hate that it ended. I eagerly devoured each episode and when that next episode would no longer be on the horizon, a little piece of my anime addiction was gone, but not forgotten....
GO GET THIS SERIES. NOW!",10
"
                since this show is just about as huge as they come, i figure that i won't have to go into HUGE detail about the story of this show because by god is this show big, like this is number one on this site, and it's the more popular and talked about version than it's 2003 adaptation, fullmetal alchemist brotherhood is obviously an amazing show. but since i plan to be objective i will point out SOME problems this show has, and believe me, there really aren't that many. in fact some may say it's pointless to even talk about said problems. but with a show
                  this popular, i do want to just say to some people that this isn't without flaws and while it is a masterpiece, you have to leave the nostalgia bubble sometimes.
story: 10/10
now, in case by some form of god you are a anime fan and somehow don't know the story, here's a quick summary. two brothers ed and alphonse elric grew up with a gift for alchemy and practiced it like crack, and when there mother passed away at an early age, they tried the taboo, human transmutation, because in this world all alchemy follows the rule of equivalent exchange. and there isn't anything that can equal a human's soul. so once they ignore that because they're 12 or something, all hell breaks loose. al looses his entire body, and ed looses his leg. however to bond al's body to a suit of armor, he sacrificed his arm as well. so the two join the military on a quest to get there bodies back to normal. THAT'S JUST THE BACKSTORY! see one of brotherhood's greatest strengths is it's story, but the story always builds on itself giving you much to learn and much to discover. each arc contains a mystery mixed with well placed action, and characters to die for. the pacing for the show is another highlight to mention as the show is 64 episodes and it never feels like it drags, or that it feels like it's too long at all. so needless to say, the story is freaking amazing.
art and animation: 8/10
the art and animation is solid for brotherhood, as it is done by studio bones, who's reputation should be enough in and of it's self. but the thing that you have to remember is, well, it's shounen, and shounen has a very particularly unique style. so the animation is average with a little crisp in there. however the setting of wherever the show is at is pretty impressive because this show takes place in just about two billion different locations, the art for the setting really felt surreal to me. which is impressive because the quality is consistent from start to finish. so props to the art and animation.
sound: 9/10
the sound department is pretty cool, as it shines very well in this show. all the openings, and by that i mean all four of them, are very enjoyable, they are awesome, very fitting for the show, my personal favorite being the first opening, again by yui. although all the openings are equally as good, that is just my personal favorite, as i sat through each one all the time, which is very impressive to me, because 99% of shows have one, good opening in the beginning, and then crap out with there second, making you skip it... THIS ONE HAD FOUR AWESOME OPENINGS! as far as the dub vs sub debates go, i personally prefer the dub of this show as funimation as usual put there A game for it. vic does an amazing edward elric and you never would know it but the actor that does alphonse is actually different, but he sounds exactly the sam, but the sub of the show was good too, so really, it's down to personal preference.
characters: 10/10
the characters of brotherhood, or fullmetal in general, are absolutely fantastic! personally to me they made the show, everyone from the main characters to the supporting characters are awesome to watch. everyone from roy mustang to scar to the elric brothers and back, are awesome characters with each of them getting great character development,  and rich entertainment. not one character felt out of place, and the badass's that the show has made those characters shine just as much. so needless to say, with every character serving a great purpose, good guys, bad guys and side characters included, they are the best part of the show, hands down.
enjoyment and overall: 10
brotherhood is just a masterfully well written piece of work, and it is undoubtedly worth the watch, but now we get to my minor complaints. see one complaint i have with the show is that they would try to fit in humor where it didn't need it. fox faces and flat out stupid faces were added in at a lot of times when it didn't really need it. the second complaint is kind of a follow up to the last one, but the show with it's amazing story really didn't feel like it took itself seriously sometimes, but that was very far and few between so this was just something small i had to bring up as it did annoy me. but since this show is epic enough, it makes up for it in spades! it is a must watch, and if your an anime fan, just watch it and believe me, you'll have a roller coaster of a time!",10
"
                Well, it's very difficoult imo to write a review without telling any spoiler, and this is also my first one, so i'm gonna be close and very very fast.
I'll start saying this is the best anime i have ever watched.  
Brotherhood is an addition to the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, fully covering the storyline of the manga by Hiromu Arakawa. It's a satisfying series which manages to stay engaging throughout its 64 episode run.
But why do you have to watch FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood? 
You have to watch it cause it's just PERFECT, even for that people who are not a lot into the anime world.
                  You're going to love every part of the story, trust me! (I've almost cried at the end, when Edward came back home with Alphonse.)
This anime has got many terrific parts with a great animation and an excellent sound (I LOVE THE 4TH OP, IT'S WOW). Characters are all distinct, fully-formed and convincing: you will love all of them (even that people you would initially think are ""naughty""). The story is brilliant, and it makes you more and more attracted to the world of alchemy. It begins in a relatively small way with the Elric's travel (I'm not going to tell you the reason of the trip, cause it would be a big spoiler lol) and expands into something magnificent I will not go into.  
I'm not a true fan of anime and manga, but Hiromu Arakawa's work is one of several which have to be seen.",10

                It's no surprise that I fucking love Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. It's up there with Berserk 1997, Code Geass and Parasyte as one of the best anime that I've ever watched. Everything from the characters to the story to the music falls nothing short of amazing.
Story:
 2 brothers use human transmutation alchemy to attempt to revive their mother but they fail miserably because they sacrifed an arm, a leg and an entire body for a freaky thing that didn't even look like their mother. And they're on a quest to look for the phollosopher stone to get their bodies back until they... Oh god I could
                  go on and on about the story of this anime but overall it's a deep, emotional and exciting thrill ride from beginning to end in my opinion.
Art:
 Honestly, the visuals are the weakest aspect of FMA Brotherhood in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't look bad. The animation quality is solid and a lot of the fight scenes are epic and the show isn't afraid to show blood but the show's visuals really isn't anything special in my opinion. I honestly think the 2003 version looks slightly better.
Sound:
 I fucking love the opening and ending songs. 3 of my favorite openings are Again (1st) Chemistry (4th) and Rain (5th) and 3 of my favorite endings are Uso (1st) Let it all out (2nd) and Sentimental Moment (4th) but the others are still great. As for voice acting, well I still have yet to hear the sub but the dub has an outstanding performance. Grant it you might recognize a few voices if you've watched more than 1 dub of other Funimation dubbed anime but the performances and delivery are near spot on.
Characters:
 This is what makes the show for me. If I can't enjoy the characters, I can't enjoy the anime and thankfully, FMA has a very layered and interesting cast. From the heroes to the villains to the morally gray characters all of the characters are important in some way and feel very distinct from each other. Great development for a lot of the characters, As well as intrigue on what kind of alchemy/ alche-history each character can perform.
Overall:
 This anime is fucking amazing! I know everyone now-a-days says that but I don't care. My enjoyment for this anime is through the roof. The story is amazing, the visuals are passable, the music and voice acting is great, the characters are fucking awesome and at no pint was I ever bored from watching this anime. That being said I highly recommend you watch the 2003 version first before watching Brotherhood because the 2003 version has a slightly better beginning and you would get more of an appreciation for Brotherhood as a result.",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist was one of my first series that I'd gotten interest in when I first started watching Anime and reading Manga. I'd watched the original FMA series before this one, expecting it to follow the manga (which I'd finished before watching anything FMA related), and while it was a good piece in it's own right, Brotherhood sat with me so much better.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood follows the manga very closely, with a similar art style and the same dynamic as the manga. If you prefer seeing anime that follows a manga, skip the first generation and come to this one, you won't be disappointed.
Anyhow, looking
                  at the Anime itself, FMA:B quite frankly was beautiful to me. You have strong lead characters, the traveling brothers Edward and his younger brother Alphonse Elric, who are alchemists that have committed the worst possible Alchemic sin. Because of this, Edward is missing an arm and a leg, and Alphonse is merely a soul bound to a suit of armor. Edward makes it his goal to bring back Alphonse's body and make him human again.
In their travels, they meet many different people and face many different challenges, facing their flaws and helping others while sticking to their morals and staying focused on their goal. 
 Alchemy in this show is not necessarily the Alchemy you learn about in your chemistry class, but a more give-and-take magic, which is a very interesting twist on the otherwise not-too-exciting idea.
Their serious situation and setting is sometimes offset with hilarious moments to help keep it from getting too heavy for a teenage audience. The humor is usually in place very well, and despite sometimes being a bit random, it isn't so awfully out of place that it ruins the moment. The humor can range from silly banter (ie picking on a character for their height, picking on them for their taste in food, etc), to humor that's a little more on the dark side that still manages to fit into the situation nicely.
The music in this show is absolutely wonderful and fits the setting very well. The soundtrack is almost if not fully orchestrated, and each tune that plays in each scenario fits beautifully and helps push the point across. It covers a wide range of emotions and energy, and oftentimes is great for listening to even without the manga when you need the inspiration.
Overall, I enjoyed FMA:B to the point where I was crying over the characters and feeling a wide range of emotions. All of the characters were so well-done and fleshed out, that they will stick with you for a long time after you watch it.",10
"
                I think it's pretty overrated, but other than that it is a overall alright anime with a unique story and amazing characters I won't forget. Especially the start of the anime, I can't think of any anime that comes similar to the beginning of the Elric brother's journey. The adventure is great for anyone wanting to take part in it but some parts are slower than others and can be hard to sit through while others can fly by ridiculously quickly. But if you are just embarking on your anime adventure, I couldn't think of any better place to start than right here. The problem
                  I have with it is that the story is played out rather boringly and is very inconsistent with the arcs being good.",7

                This review contains spoilers for both Attack on Titan up to the Season 4 (final season is misleading) and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood
For a show lauded as the greatest of all time, it lives up to the hype, mostly. I wouldn't go far as to say it's the greatest shonen out there or for that matter, greatest anime. FMAB is for one, overhyped. I cannot in good conscience put this at a 10 and struggled to put it at even a 9. I finished my marathon of the show a few months back to let myself fully put together my thoughts on the show and I
                  think I understand how I feel about it. 
Promises kept and broken. Let me elaborate. This is one acccessible show, anyone can watch it and get behind it. That doesn't make it bad, just because something is popular does not disqualify it from praise, it's popular for a reason. Its a fun romp through Amestris with everyone's favorite brothers, Ed and Alphonse. The story takes its time before taking off and I gotta say, it gets really good as it goes on. But it's not amazing, the story twists and turns which always keeps you guessing. I like that in shows, what I feel like it misses is the extra bit of kick that's present in Attack on Titan. The Homonculi are a well established threat but they kinda leave Elric alone until the plot decides to move in the direction of Father. On the other hand, the Titan Shifters pose an omnipresent threat to our characters which always leaves the audience guessing as to who's a traitor, when will they strike, and how many will die. It's powerful and adds a kick to the story that leaves you in suspense. I never feared for Ed or Alphonse. Hughes was a surprise death and one of the better parts of the show, but it never pushes you out of your comfort zone. It stands to reason that the big reveal and twist makes up for this, but that's not the case. I like that Wrath is the Fuhrer, I like the whole Philosopher Stone conspiracy, I like that the Dad isn't evil, I like how you can't revive people. Thats the good shit. But again, with the exception of the first two I listed, most of the twists aren't all that interesting or fun. They don't leave you guessing, it spells out everything for you. Arrack on Titan gets the whole twist thing right. Eren dies in the fifth episode, nevermind he's a titan now, one of their comrades is also a Titan shifter and kills a bunch of people, that person happens to be Annie, there are titans in the walls, the wall religion knows more then they let on, the Colossal and Armored Titans are Reiner and Bertholdt (whom the audience and characters have great attachment to), Titans are humans, Eren can control Titans but only once for some reason. Thats how to pull of twist after twist that leaves the audience dazed and confused. It respects your intelligence because it isn't spoon fed to you, it plays out as it gives you everything you need to find it out beforehand, the show just put the information in the most obtuse places that you'll get it once its revealed and then it all makes sense. I love that. The story for FMAB gets an 8/10, good but needs improvement.
Everything else I'll cover here. The animation is great, I love Bones. Soundtrack is alright but forgettable (OPs are good). Characters are on point and the best part about the show, 10/10. I enjoyed the hell out of this show 9/10
Overall, this show has me with mixed feelings. It may seem like I've just bashed it in this review but I genuinely like this show. The story clicks in places (Ishvalan stuff is always welcome) and doesn't in other (pacing drags the show down quite a bit). I compared it a lot to Attack on Titan sort of in spite of the fandom war. FMAB fans love to proclaim their show as the GOAT, the greatest ever. But it falls short in many places. Yeah, I liked it a lot but I can't shake this feeling that its inferior in almost every way to Attack on Titan. They get compared so much, I dont care anymore. I know it isn't fair. It's definitely not deserving of #1 on MAL. Top 50, sure. This show would be a 7 or 8 if I didn't like the characters as much as I do. In conclusion, this is the peak of shonen. It doesn't change up the formula that much, its a safe shonen. If you don't want to be kicked around by a (for the most part) genius writer, watch this. Hiromu Arakawa did a great job on this story and I'd watch it again. I just don't understand the unbridled hype for this show.",9

                This review is mainly in context of watching the original fullmetal alchemist, just keep that in mind.
  This show is my favourite anime of them all (at least for now) and I love this so much more than the original, mainly because of the better ending, which I won't spoil because it is a treat. Anyways, this show is guaranteed to give you enjoyment, and you'll definitely rate this show highly compared to others (there's a reason why this show tops many top anime lists). The only thing is that I recommend watching the original fma before or after this mainly because of how
                  the story differs. The original fma is more of a story of character, like hughes who is given much more time in the original, while brotherhood is more of a story of plot. Another great feat of this show is how it cemented my taste in anime. I like more somber anime with more mature themes, and this show is the main reason why. Overall,  this show is a definite recommendation and you will very likely fall in love with this anime.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Fullmetal Alchemist series from 2003. It begins right where the original show left off which, as you might remember, was at a notorious cliffhanger. They waste no time continuing the story in Brotherhood and providing the conclusion that the fans had all been waiting for. Despite this, I don’t think it’s necessary to watch the two shows in chronological order. I’ve never seen the original and I was only confused for the first 20 episodes.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (or FMA:B, as the intellectuals call it) stands as one of the most under-appreciated anime series of all
                  time. From its heart-breaking character development to its suspenseful story, this adventure shounen will keep you hooked for hours. I had seen FMA:B on an obscure list a few months ago and decided to check out it just for kicks, not expecting anything from a random Bones anime. When I finally got around to watching it, I was pleasantly surprised by how consistent the pacing was and how the animation gorgeously captured the science of alchemy. I was fully immersed in the world-building and dramatic twists. I binged through the whole thing in only a couple of days and couldn’t believe when it was over. After reaching the satisfying end, I felt the urge to let everyone know of this underrated gem. FMA:B might build on what FMA started, but I think even as a direct sequel it holds its own. It’s accessible for all demographics—western or eastern, adult or child—and makes up for its lack of nudity with wholesome platonic relationships. Dark themes mix with light humor in a perfect solution of classic anime enjoyment.
9/10 show for sure, but I bumped it down to 8/10 because the little Chinese girl with the panda thing was so freaking annoying. I swear to Father, I will crush her tiny adorable face with my fist and laugh as her unbearably high-pitched voice is silenced forever. I wish I could go back in time and make sure she was never written in this show.",8
"
                What can I say about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood that hasn't been said before? This anime is hands-down the best anime of all time (not my personal favorite though). Join the Elric brothers on their path to acquiring the Philosopher's Stone in order to gain back what they lost by breaking the most important law of Alchemy, only to realize there is more to the Stone than meets the eye, and they may be playing into the hands of a much larger threat that will take everything they and their friends have to defeat. 
Pros: Objectively best anime of all time, everything about this is great.
Cons:
                  The first half-ish is a bit whacky in terms of pacing. 
Other Pro: Only one real con
You will like this if you like anime. If you don't enjoy this in any way then your tastes would have to be EXTREMELY niche.",10
"
                The ONLY other anime I'd put on the same level with this is Hellsing Ultimate.
The writing in this is so so so good. A plot that makes a ton of sense, and the first piece of fictional writing that actually has some thought into what ""God"" actually is.
The character development literally is one of the best parts of this anime. Edward stars as a little boy in the first few episodes and by the end turns into a ripped young man, who even Winry notices when she talks about how broad his shoulders have gotten.
The animation is great, the back stories, the soundtrack, the 7
                  deadly sins being put into antagonist with feelings themselves was remarkable. 
Like a lot of anime, its usually a point where you think the bad guy has figured out his master plan, but you know the good guys will come up with a plan to triumph in the end. 
However there is a time, even if its brief where you actually think the antagonist has won, and you feel bad watching, something different for a change.
I did think the middle episodes up in Mt Briggs were a BIT of a drag, but for the most part, each episode had plenty of information that was useful and meaningful, especially if you watch it twice.
Soundtrack is flawless between the high's and low's to the action.",10
"
                Although it was much different, both series are very enjoyable and successful in their own individual ways, having two different stories gives both series a different appearance, opinions and views of characters are different- e.g. Ed and Roy are more friendly and work together more, where as in the first series Ed is more Naive and doesn't understand Roy's actions as much.
Also, the two different story lines were deliberate intentions of Hiromu Arakawa- the original author, she helped with the development of series one and only went so far into the series afterwards gave all story and plot to the producers etc, in order to
                  create a different ending. Then the second series could be based on the manga to a much more detailed degree.",10
"
                The way in which the characters is approached in the anime is excellent, how their traumas are shown and how they develop the characters is incredible, there are no unnecessary deaths, apart from when they are used as character development in a very beautiful way, the brothers Elric who in this case are the main protagonists, are examples of well-made characters, they were already considered the best anime brothers by the Japanese themselves and this is due to the construction and development of characters that are of a totally different level, it is even difficult to explain, but the author knew how to develop them
                  in an incredible way that sounds natural, nothing seems forced by the story is something unique, and for those who think that it is only they who receive credit in the story I have one more surprise, ALMOST ALL characters there is growth in the work, the author turns and moves places their story in the middle of the main plot, approaching them at the same time that he does it with the main ones, and again, it doesn't seem strange, a rare thing, it's usually just the main two and that's it, but no, here are practically everyone, and in general the story behind them is really exciting, examples of life, and moral lessons, are things that this anime gives us and true lessons of friendship, the scenes they are put in you really feel them, what they go through and what they want, make you literally immersed in the work and its development , so for this in terms of character FMAB only receives my praise, for doing what almost in anime does, literally feeling the character.
FMAB is a “complete” anime in terms of history, it has its due beginning middle and end, another very rare thing in the anime industry that has left hundreds open, forcing us to go after material that is sometimes difficult to access or not. we found, in this case we don’t have to worry the story is complete, the most you’ll want is to go see how it is in the original material, but it’s said that Brotherhood is very faithful.
As much as you look for reasons to give a bad rating, you can't, this is FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood.",10
"
                If I could name any series I would use to bring my friends into anime, it would be Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
Why? Because it is the complete package. 
You'll probably hate me for saying this, but I originally got into anime by reliving my nostalgia & watching Avatar: The Last Airbender. They're completely different shows, but their reviews would sound startlingly similar if they both came from me.
That's because, while both shows are for completely different audiences, they both have everything you could look for - awesome fight scenes, great dialogue, intriguing characters, and maybe a few plot twists to keep you guessing along the way.
If
                  one of my friends had seen TLA as a kid & wondered where they could find more great shows like that, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood would be the first show I'd recommend.
I'll gloss over the positives in the series, as it's already been said pretty much a hundred times over by a hundred better writers, but despite my score, this series does have some flaws.
First of all - I hope you like short jokes. Because this series has 'em. A lot of 'em.
More to the point though, while I found the humour effective for the most part, it can get increasingly one-note as the show progresses, and you start to find out that they're kinda just retelling the same joke over and over again. Not really a negative for me, as I still found it funny, but it's something to note.
Also, if you prefer more realistic action, this show ain't for you. People just don't seem to freakin' die in this show. I mean, hell, they even set the tone for it by having Edward survive losing both his arm & his leg as a kid. I'm really surprised the Black Knight from Monty Python didn't make an appearance. He would fit right in. 
Your mileage may vary with the ending. I know why & how things happened the way they did, and they were set up earlier on in the series, but it just seemed a bit anti-climactic to me at the time. Perhaps it's something that can be fixed with another viewing (which I'll take any excuse for tbh). The last episode itself is great, but the ""final boss"", so to speak, just seemed like it should've been bigger in my mind.
2ND VIEWING EDIT: Yup. It was fixed. Don't make the same mistake I did - pay attention to things, even if it seems like it's not important.
I also wish that Ed & Al stopped calling each other ""Brother"" every single time they want to get their attention. Nobody with an actual brother ever does that. Maybe it's a Japanese thing I can't relate to, who knows. But it was there on the dubbed version too (the version I watched, it's good fight me), so I don't know.
So why's it a 10/10?
Because dammit, I just had too much fun watching this series to really give those issues much thought outside of this review.
Off the top of my head, those are the main issues I ran into with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. If it seems like they're pretty small, that's because they are. 
It has its flaws, yes, but the positives FAR outweigh the negatives.
The action, while requiring a certain suspension of belief, is amazing.
The story is well-paced, and knows where it's going from the very beginning.
The characters in this show, while relatively simple, are all memorable in their own way. Their voice acting is top-notch in both the Japanese & English versions, something not all anime can say (looking at you, Hunter x Hunter).
I could keep going, but this review is long enough already & it's probably already been covered 100 times over.
If you're looking for a long adventure series that knows what it's trying to do from the beginning, while having the skill to actually execute on that idea, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is for you.
But, judging by its rankings on this site, you probably already knew that.",10
"
                I need y'all to understand that I was fully prepared to give this a nine until I got to the end (I am gonna pick on it a lot, though. I love it A LOT, but it has to be done).
I mean, I knew it was gonna be bomb. I've finally ticked the highest rated anime on this site off my list, and I can see why it's got that esteem. I have a feeling this is going to be a very long review, so strap in. Now, while I did give this anime the highest overall rating, I will say that I did have
                  quite a few issues with it while watching it, though mostly that has to do with personal preferences with narratives and how they're structured (that'll make more sense later). I still think the overall story itself was perfectly done, and that's why it got the marks it did, but I'm gonna take you through all the positives AND negatives I have about each piece of this anime. 
Art and sound are fairly easy to sum up. I'm so violently picky about art styles, so FMAB absolutely did not appeal to me at first. I started watching it a couple months ago before I was really committed to watching it, and I could even make it five minutes in before I had to quit because the art style wasn't what I'm used to. I understand that that's judgmental and unnecessary now, though, because I came to friggin' love the art style. It's very simple-- like, there's not a whole hell of a lot going on as far as striking colors or effects or character designs go, but the simplicity made it more charming and entrancing to watch. The sound, to be honest, was average. There were some good OP and ED songs, and the OST songs were often perfectly imputed to relay the mood of a scene or whatever, but it was spectacular. The voice acting was top-notch, obviously. Some of the best you'll find in anime, period. 
On to the big stuff-- the story. As I said, I can't really find fault in the story at all as far as the story that was told goes. It tells a really lovely story about family, tenacity, and how far humans will go for the people they love. The story itself is what brought my opinion of this anime up so high where it otherwise could've been dampened. That being said, the pacing did irritate me a bit throughout the whole anime. The ending 20 episodes or so did slow it down quite a lot, but the rest of the anime was very fast paced. Even at the end, even though time was passing more slowly than during the rest of the anime, events and climactic moments were still happening really quickly. The story wasn't affected by it, don't get me wrong; you still get a full story that's worth experiencing, but the anime 100% could've been stretched out to 80 or more episodes to allot more time for the audience to really get stuck into the story. 
Because of the pacing, there were some important points that didn't really get elaborated on at all. You still get the jist, it's just a bit later than it could've been had the anime given more time to flesh out the story. In addition to that, the world building wasn't all that great, either. You do get a bit of history on alchemy and the antagonists' species, but only what is necessary to understand the story. It would've been so much cooler if we'd gotten to see the depths of alchemy, such as the types, their uses, the science behind it, etc. The anime had a story to tell, and it did-- wonderfully-- but there was so much more it could've done to make the world richer. Maybe that wasn't the point, and that's okay. I still really loved the story as is, I just wish I knew more. 
Speaking of knowing more, let's talk characters. I am a BIG advocate for strong characters. I crave them. FMAB had a lot of brilliant characters in it with vivid personalities and clear goals. I really do feel like I can identify who they each are as people by how they were presented in the story. However, character-based stories will always feel better for me to watch than story-based characters. 
Now, listen, I'm not trying to throw shade and say that these characters don't develop and change throughout the anime, it's just... man, it's, like, only a little bit. Okay, okay, SOME characters do get nicely fleshed out, but not all the time is it the important ones. In fact, one of the main, billboard characters of this series has zip to show for development. At the end, every character did undergo a character change, but where was my development the rest of the time, huh?
I feel like I'm not articulating this well. Character-based stories, yeah? These are narratives that thrive on information we've learned about the characters. There's a story to be had regardless, but the real substance comes from knowing about the characters, their pasts, and how they change based on what's happening around them. Story-based characters-- which is was FMAB has-- are characters that only get pieces of their past revealed when it's required for the viewer to understand the narrative. Because of that, it makes it really hard to see a character change because they don't really have a base point to grow from. It causes stagnant characters to be born. Now, this is entirely my personal preference of how I like narratives to be structured, but FMAB disappointed me in that regard because I was really hoping for an array of characters that I could deeply attach myself to like I have with a few other anime. It was like they all had brilliant personalities, and their time in the story was infinitely entertaining to watch, but they didn't have substance. A lot of that, I'm sure, comes down to how short the anime was for something in this genre, as well, but still.
Regardless of all that, though, I will say that, because the story was done so well, it did allow me to seriously love a lot of these characters. Because of the story, I felt for them and wanted to see them to a happy ending and felt pain when they felt pain, I just-- again-- wish I knew more about them. More about their pasts, their mindsets, their abilities, maybe even seeing them develop their abilities to a higher caliber a bit. High-key still some of the most interesting characters I've seen in anime, though.
I'm picking on it a lot, I understand. I just saw a lot of potential in it. Really, what it is at the end of the day is the fact that I wanted to spend so, so much more time in this world. I wanted to watch them grow more, struggle more, learn more, love more. Those can all be chalked up to supplementals, I suppose. Honestly, though, I think that for anyone who's into anime or looking to get into it, this is a must-watch. It's a sort of right-of-passage, I think, but that's not why you should watch it. It's got heart, it's got a hell of a story, and it's got something that no other anime does. Something about this anime just fills you up, makes you feel like there's a bigger world out there to be explored. I'm certainly glad that I took the time to fall into the world of FMAB. I know you will be, too.",10
"
                I thought the original Fullmetal Alchemist was an amazing series, and I definitely recommend the original sereies to anyone who has not seen it. That being said I feel Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is as close to perfection as a series can get. 
The cons: There are really only 2 very minor ones
1. The pacing is initially very fast and it could be tricky to follow. However it does slow down to a much better pace early on and, if you are familiar with the original series, the pacing won't be an issue at all. I actually watched FMA: Brotherhood before the original but I actually
                  didn't have a problem with the pacing.
2. Some say the tone of FMA: Brotherhood is to lighthearted,  but this show is still very dark and very mature throughout its run. It is more lighthearted than the original, but there are very few anime as dark as the original Fullmetal Alchemist. So if you prefer darker and more depressing series, than you might like the original more than Brotherhood. 
The pros: Everything else
The characters ALL are memorable, well written, developed, and have a role in the story. There is not a single weak link in the entire cast which is almost unheard of in anime with huge casts like this show.
The music is fantastic and fits every scene perfectly.
The animation by studio BONES (Cowboy Bebop, Space Dandy, Soul Eater, Sword of the Stranger, My Hero Academia, One Punch Man) is gorgeous and the action is well choreographed.
The story is engaging, surprising, and filled with twists and turns both big and small.
This show can be dark, depressing, funny, action packed, intense as all hell, romantic, epic, emotional, and everything else in between. It is a very ambitious series and it pays of in every sense of the word. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is truly a masterpiece.
Side note, the Dub is arguably the greatest in all of anime and deserves to be watched.",10
"
                Wow I can't Believe the conclusion to Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood.

                so this is my first review after both my other reviews have been deleted so...here's a new one.
Story:9
The reason I didn't rate this a 10 is because I watched the 2003 version and Brotherhood is basically the remake of it in anime version. It's basically about two brothers who lose their bodies or parts of their limbs after a botched attempt at human alchemy. So they become stronger and seek the philosopher's stone, a stone that has all the properties of alchemy (I forgot what the philosopher stone is). 
Art: 9
The art definitely had a reboot, specifically Edward's hair color changing, Winry's hair and eye
                  color having a lighter color, and some other minor changes I don't really remember.
Sound: 8
The anime definitely has some of my favorite music, like the first opening, and the second and fourth ending. But overall, that's all the music that stuck to me. The rest didn't really stick to me.
Character: 10
The characters are really well developed, I feel, especially Edward and Alphonse Elric, amd they have strong personalities, which again ties into them being well developed. Even the side characters have some depth into them, it'a not like they're just one-sided.
Enjoyment: 10
Oh man, how I enjoyed this anime. I binge watched it in the summer and the episodes kept me hooked holy..I loved it.
Overall:10
I love this anime so much omg. You should definitely give it a try if you liked the manga or wish for some action, or both. This is definitely worth a watch.
This anime is not the number one anime in MAL for nothing.",10
"
                One of the best anime I have seen.
I have seen the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist series, and even though it was enjoyable as well, it did not stand up to this one.
This anime was one of the one's that always had me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen in the next episode, what was going to happen next? What are the characters going to do now?
This is one of the the anime ""legends"" since it has become so popular and frankly I'm not surprised about it. I give this the highest score popular since it was perfect it every way
                  possible.",10
"
                This anime is way overrated, but still good.  The characters are often two dimensional, though there are some exceptions, particularly toward the end, where there is more complexity and depth.
To me, the story felt very contrived, both in terms of characterization and in terms of plot.  In terms of characterization, I just do not believe that the bad guys would actually want to do what the bad guys want to do, at least the human ones.  Even so-called evil people have families and friends they care about.  Power struggles in real life are more like a battle over scarce resources (or
                  resources perceived as scarce) rather than individuals being purely selfish and willing to destroy anything and everything to help their own individual situation.  
The worst examples of contrived, 2-dimensional characters are those fantasy stories where there is some ""Dark Evil Lord"" with a horde of monsters whose goal in life is to cause pain and suffering and ugliness, who have to be beaten by the morally good people, elves, hobbits, whatever.  FMA-B is not that bad, but it is not particularly good, either.  I just do not buy into the bad guys as realistic.
In terms of story/plot, there are conspiracy elements throughout.  I don't think that's a spoiler because it comes out almost immediately as a primary element of the story.    Depending upon the scope of any conspiracy, it may be more or less reasonable to believe it could remain secret for a long period of time.  Without saying where this all falls in this story, I find it highly unbelievable that the conspiracies at issue would have remained so.
There are various power inconsistencies.  An alchemist in one scene might be struggling and fighting hand to hand with some bad guys, and in another episode he basically snaps a finger, does a bit of alchemy, and defeats a greater number of stronger bad guys.  It seems like the power level of the character is based on whether the author wanted to make the character just barely survive, barely win, or show he totally dominates the opponent, without actually having a reason for that (like the character has studied, and powered up).  This is a contrast to an anime like, say, Hunter X Hunter, where the main characters are constantly working to get stronger, and their performance in fights is very appropriate in light of where they are in their continuum over the various arcs.  There really is no powering up to speak of in FMA-B.
The rules of magic are not very well-defined.  Initially, it is presented like studying a science such as chemistry.  As you learn the rules, you can create complex formulas to create a desired result.  And the Elric brothers are studying this stuff obsessively from early childhood and seem to be geniuses to boot, so they are really great at it even being young.  However, then it is all changed up when we meet other alchemists and they all have their own ""niche"" powers.  The flame alchemist who basically just makes fire, the water alchemist, etc.  It seems like some alchemists are basically one-power specialists.  But if you need to learn the ""science"" to advance, it seems like every alchemist that rises to a certain level should be able to do all types of alchemy at a certain proficiency.  So when it later is implied that only one alchemist can do fire, only a couple can do healing alchemy, etc, I was somewhat confused.  
And why, in a nation where alchemy is real to the point that the government employs State Alchemists as sort of like government-sponsored superheroes who roam around dispensing justice, would you ever have a city where some guy is able to dupe the whole city into thinking he's a messenger from God by doing some alchemy tricks?  That was very confusing.  There were a lot of things that did not really seem to flow too well in the story.
A lot of the dialogue was too cheesy and long-winded.  The number of times there were characters who had to move, with no second to spare, and they stopped to have a conversation with some one that went on and on and on with stuff like, ""You promise me, you won't die! You'll come back to me!  You got that?  I won't let you die!""  And boom, they all die, because they really did have to hurry, and that means they did not have time for five minutes of heartfelt goodbyes and declarations of affection.  Well, no, they did not die, but the point is that kind of thing is rather annoying and, to my view, sloppy.
I guess the main thing it had going for it was originality.  I mean, to conceive of a world and nation with a very original combination of tech and non-tech, magical system, political history, etc., is a feat.  So many anime are just the same old wandering around in a land of fairies and dragons and magic and knights, or battling in some kind of robot suit.  It's nice to have something very different.  (I wrote a scathing review of Death Note, also highly over-rated because of contrivances, wherein I similarly applauded its originality as the thing that really made everything else forgivable).
So, ultimately, the flaws of FMA-B are forgivable.  It's a good anime.  But it sure does not deserve to be in the top 5 all time, or wherever it is rated on this site.",7
"
                I really wanted to try this series out. I loved the original, and it's one of the top rated series. It's a really good story with good ideas, nice plot twists, and cool fight scenes, but the anime is just kind of okay. Must admit, I'm  little disappointed by this.
I have two big complaints about this series. 
First off, the anime is too childish. Even in serious scenes, there is a lot of comedy just thrown in there. Which is odd, for how dark the subject material is in the series. It's nice to have a reminder that the main characters are only children,
                  but it's so over done that it takes away from the true horror of the story.
Secondly, I don't care what happens to any of the characters. I'm a huge crier and I connect easily with characters. But they didn't ever give me the chance. Every time some deep dark horrible secret was relieved, it was said and then the characters moved on like... nothing happened. It just felt very unrealistic.
I do wish they would have put a little more effort into the first episodes. They are very rushed, unlike the rest of the series, and it was very noticeable. This would have made it much better stand alone series, but I guess they just assumed most people already saw they original, and it wasn't necessary. But watching a bunch of recap episodes with no real substance, got boring very quickly.
Overall, I think it's definitely worth watching. The ideas and theories are very unique, and even make it seem like alchemy is possible. But for me, one time watching it was enough.",6
"
                No review is needed for this one its fun to watch and this is one of the most popular anime so far. Also majority of us are guilty of taking sadistic pleasures in episode cold flames I watched it as a kid and amount of hate that grew within me for envy was on next level.
Anime has brutal elements and a too sweet ending unlike anime like Naruto well adult/teenage Naruto got sugary ending too... well FMA brotherhood got no fillers has good comedy little dark plus a thriller and if u guys are into that than its your type of anime. Great anime :)

                      A timeless classic, a must watch for anyone who enjoys the anime medium. The characters are all outstanding, the plot is phenomenal. I cannot come up with anything to dislike about the anime. It is the perfect gateway for someone new to anime. The plot is riddled with excitement and mystery, and plot twists that you will never see coming on your first time through! The show has some of the best character development i have ever seen. Additionally, the English dub is very high quality, much more so than usual. This show will always have a place in
                  my top 10 best shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching!",10
"
                First I have to say this is my fave anime of all time so this might seem biased. Anyways, the story is of two brothers who lose parts of their bodies, and one them loses his whole body and his soul is attached toa suit of armour. They lose their mom and try to bring her back using this stories version of alchemy and it ends badly. Like I said justa second ago they lose their bodies. So they set out on a journey to find a relic called the Philosophers stone which can break alchemys rule of you must lose something in order to
                  obtain something. On the way they join the state alchemists to get more information on the stone. Everything else goes from here. The brothers are also constantly running into bumps in the road and villians. Since they're in the military, they have to fight these creatures, the homunculie. Since they have to fight them it gives them more than just a ""I need to save the world so I will"" motivations. 
The art of this show isn't really the most unique, but it still looks quite good. It was also animated by bones. Who are pretty good animators and have made other good looking anime
Each of the characters all seem likable and fun to watch. Since the show is fairly long you get to see each characters comedic side and a dramatic/dark side. although I didn't like how all the characters in this version at the beginning were just kind of thrown in there just so they would already be there.
The first about 13 or 14 episodes felt rushed so that the new stuff for brotherhood could shine in soon and just get over with the original 2003 stuff.
My enjoyment of the show was amazing. I loved each and every second of it, there was always something happening to keep me engaged.  It has many twist and turn along the way. It's also good it can be good through each episode considering its length.
Overall I would I would give it an easy 10/10",10

                *This review contains minor spoilers*
Ok, im not angry with this one, like i was with Evangelions overall review. I couldn't understand that, but i do understand this one.
Probably the best shonnen ever made, it's not surprise being #1 on the top for years now.
Searching for an fail, i could find it. Maybe it's fast in the begining, BUT, i don't think it's a big problem a all. I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM, I NEEDED MORE EPISODES. Lie, adding something wrong would've been horrible. its perfect just like this.
It's the story with best details, best characters, (in my view) one of the best humour in shonnen,
                  
The story of Elric brothers it's perfect. It's an interesting story of two alchemist brothers who made the forbidden and now want to recover their bodys. A shonnen with feeling, development, logic. Without POWER UPS. Almost real.
I can't (and I Wont) talk about how much the characters develop because it's INSANE. The story is so good that you can watch it al lot of times and will always make sense. While you know locations, characters, hystorical moments and relations, the story is making more and more sense, and if you watch it again, you will see how the background had always be the same.
The background of Amestris, Father, the Homunculus, VAN HOHENHAIM god sake, it's just sublime.
The characters are the big deal in this story, further the battles are epic and the alchemy way better than the chakra or the ki.
The characters are humans, you can know what they feel, you can understand WHY are they motivated to make the things they make all the time.
Edward elric is one of the best main characters ever, with probably Shinji, Kenshin and Spike. When he smiles, I smile, when he cries, I cry. He it's a VERY GOOD person. He develops his point of view about moral at the same time he evolves his view about the world from being arrogant about alchemy and religious to know that the alchemy is not that good either, it's not perfect and it IS a human invention to became GOD witch isn't good either. He startes being a person who hated the thing of being short, but a beautiful detail it's how he grews up physically and psychologically to a person who can value life, people and how experiences make we who we are. He makes the family he could have, he makes it without killing a soul. He makes it through the end against all odds.
I did cry more when and kid ed tolds winry that alphonse would hate him, or when ed marries winry MORE than when hughes die, sorry not sorry.
Alphonse Elric it's too one of the best main characters. A simple kid who just wanted to see her mother again, who trust his life every second to his brother, who pass days without remember how hot or cold feel, who would something taste. He just wanted to be loved, he just wanted to be with her mother. But he developes too, he could defeat the thoughts of being an invention of his brother, he could defeat thinking everyday that maybe he wasn't a human beeing. Not a real one. Beeing just a soul in a shell. Thinking everyday that maybe it was his last, that his soul could anytime get out of the armor, that maybe the moment when he could be a normal person and have a girlfriend would never came. But he was strong. He could. And finnally he is happy, he has a family.
Winry is A WOMAN. Something almost IMPOSSIBLE to happen in the actual shonnen Industry. You can compare Winry with every woman in every current shonnen and she would be a better character. And the real love, the perfect logic and construction of the love between she and ed it's just tears me up of happiness, just like edo onces said it would.
Roy Mustang is the best secondary character ever, I think. At least in a shonnen. It has BRAIN. He THINKS. He FEELS. He UNDESTAND. He is equally develop and interesting as elric brothers. We NEED an spin off about him. The only problem i have with his development it's that his power it's just OP. His relationship with Ryza is the other big couple of the series. I love them. ''its raining'', yes, it is.
SCAR is another big character. He is a logic enemy, with a logic redemption. It's not just ''evangelic talk'' like in naruto, he understand what happened with his lands and people. He has one of the best type of power and one of the best forms of obtaining. We all love him too, why not.
Van Hohenhaim. I started hating him, and that it's one of the best parts of his story. The story makes you hate him, and finnally, understand that he suffered and suffered all his life until the last part of it. He is introduced like a bad guy to finnally evolve into a loving person, who loved his family and who just wanted to be a normal person with a normal life, but carry on a big weight because of ''father''. He feels like it was in part his fault and he just HAVE TO change it, because he is the only one who can. Or well..
Father and the homunculus are too much. They are too good. Their plan it's good. They final arc with the almost evangelion scenes are art. Father is one of that villians we all want in the stories. Like Makoto Shishio. a bit less maybe, shishio it's perfect xd
Envy it's, behind greed, my favorite homunculus. He only wanted to be like the humans, because of that he hated them. But that feeling, made him one of the most humanized homunculus. rest in peace
LING YAO (Fu) and GREED are A BAD ASS AND PERFECT COUPLE. Both learn about each other. Ling yao it's a person who just want the best to his family. Wants immortality because he needs it. He needs Fu and Lan Fan because they are his friends and they would give their lives to save him. And he would do the same for them. Greed learns that he was greedy because he wanted that, family, friends. He wanted power because he wanted to be someone, he wanted to be respected and loved. Ling yao see his failures in greed's failures and also learn. Rest in peace you too, greedo.
The Armstrong brothers are other good secundary characters, with a lot of personality.
THE TRUTH it's the best plot device ever made, because it isn't a device to solve the plot, probably the other way around. It is a good perception of God, and how we all improve our selfs. How the door's of each person are it's one of all the details witch makes this my favorite anime, or like how all the people calls different to Ed. The truth it's something difficult to explain, and that makes it better. It's not like other shonnen where you can understand God. Where you can see the form of God or maybe how it thinks, because it's impossible to write down how it thinks, and in this hiromu shows her brilliant, with this form of god.
The Art and the Sound are both epic. All the openings and endings are masterpieces, just like this story. I don't know what more to say but probably, later I will know and I will regret submiting this now, but now I can only say:
This story has a heart made of fullmetal, and will always be part of mine. Thank you Hiromu Arakawa",10
"
                I have watched the original FMA series and I have to say this reboot of the 2003 FullMetal Alchemist is much better than its predecessor. The story takes place in a world where a select few individuals are blessed with the power of Alchemy : The power to deconstruct and reconstruct matter. The story follows 2 brother Edward and Alphonse Elric who stumbled across the power of alchemy. After their mother's death, they try to use their power to bring her back since she was their only family. Their attempt in human transmutation(resurrection) was a failure resulting in Edward losing his right hand and left
                  leg while Alphonse losing his body. The two set out on a journey to find a Philosopher's Stone : an object that can overcome the rules of Alchemy, which will help them restore their bodies.
There is nothing more to say because this show is a must watch. Everything is just perfect. The first opening of the anime is considered to be one of the best openings ever made.",10
"
                Just re-watched it not long ago.  I remember watching some episodes on TV a long time ago and I remembered how I liked it.  So I binged watched it and its still as good as I remember!  This will always be in my top favorite animes!  I liked it is because all the characters at least to me have depth you can see their thought process on why they act a certain way.  How the story evolves and how it amps up so quickly and you get so absorbed into it.  All around I think it has an amazing
                  story and great characters.",10

                IF YOU SEE A LOW RATING REVIEW, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE PERSON HAS NOT WATCHED THE WHOLE SERIES YET. IT IS OUTRAGEOUS. DON'T BOTHER READING THEM.
*SPOILERS FOR BOTH FMA AND FMA:B*
Hey, This is my first review and i'll be talking a bit about FMA: brotherhood. I decided to watch both FMA and FMA: Brotherhood and I must say, it was a  pleasure. 
FMA(original) had an unique storyline and ending. The story did not follow the manga towards the later part of the series. I felt the story mainly focused on finding the philosopher stone. Along the way, viewers get to see a stronger
                  connection between Al and Ed. There was also more emphasis on Scar and the Homunculi's life and experiences. They barely touch upon Hohenheim (Ed and Al's dad) which I thought had a large role in the story. I got a bit bored of the story towards the end because it got confusing and didn't seem to flow properly. The ending was unique and good, but it did not satisfy viewers and it was kind of a cliff hanger even if you watched the movie. 8/10
FMA: Brotherhood followed the manga, and it seemed to aim more towards ""mainstream"" animes. FMA: Brotherhood had several reoccurring voices, like Edward, Winry, and Roy Mustang, but it also lost some old voices such as Alphonse and Scar. It took some time to get over Al, but eventually it was fine. With the award-winning cast and some new additions, they improved from the original a lot. The relationship between Ed and Al was implied, so they focused on their relationship between other characters. They also didn't focus on Edward 100% of the time (IMO, Ed was in like every scene in original). Instead, they gave Alphonse a lot of solo missions (and a bigger role), developed a new character named Greed/Lin, developed many other characters and had LESS EMPHASIS on the philosopher stone. Winry and Ed, Xing and Ling, Mai Chang and Al, Roy and Riza had they're moments, if you know what I mean. Hohenheim(Elric) had a MUCH BIGGER role in this than the original which was definitely nice to see. Given six years and a manga to follow, they cut out a lot of fillers and improved from the original. The ending was very satisfying compared to the original even though it was more cliché. 11/10
Episodes 0-30 Original was better imo. It was more detailed and darker.
Episodes 30-64 Brotherhood no doubt was better. Even though, brotherhood didn't have a great start, it definitely picked it up towards the end. A huge variety of new characters, better character development and a stronger plot to follow.
Characters - Original VS Brotherhood
Ed - Brotherhood. Winry and Ed = GG 
Al - Brotherhood. More independent and interesting 
Winry - Brotherhood. In a lot more episodes...too bad they didn't kiss 
Scar - Brotherhood. Glad he helped. Didn't like him rebellious. 
Greed/Ling - Brotherhood. He was Badass.
Roy - Brotherhood. Even more Badass than before. 
Riza - Brotherhood. More involved.
Roy's Team - Brotherhood. Sad and Happy things happen. 
Hohenheim - Brotherhood. HAD IMPORTANCE IN THE STORY. 
Fuhrer Bradley - Brotherhood. ACTUALLY FOUGHT
Pinako - Brotherhood.
Shou Tucker - Brotherhood. Glad hes gone. 
Yoki(mustache dude) - Brotherhood. He was like Hercule in DBZ 
Lust - Original. I missed her. 
Envy - Original. Didn't really like both characters
Gluttony - Original. Showed more emotion, rather than go maniacal.
Louis Armstong - Original. He was annoying, but he got owned in FMA:B
Hughes - Original. 
Izumi Curtis - Original. Was a lot darker and sadder. 
Marco - Original. I didn't like him. Should've gotten rid of him in FMA:B. 
Rose - Original. She was brown.
Bigger roles were played better in Brotherhood.
Viewers should definitely watch both because they are great. I found brotherhood to be alot better because of its stronger plot, improved and vast character development, and definitive ending. FMA offered a darker, more linear sort of story and brotherhood offered colorful and satisfying story.
FMA:Brotherhood is an amazing anime, one of the best i've seen. I highly recommend watching it.
Thanks for reading.",10
"
                After watching the 2003 adaptation I then watched Brotherhood right after. Before watching I actually thought Brotherhood was a sequel for some reason. Instead it's actually a more faithful adaptation to the manga. Because of this, the first 13-15 episodes had the same events as the 2003 version, but after that it was completely different. I decided to watch this in English because the first version's dub was great. So which version was the superior one? Most importantly was it good in general? Here are my thoughts.***contains MINOR spoilers***
Story:10/10
Incredibly well written. It follows the same journey as the original but with different plotlines. While still
                  maintaining the same amount of humor and darkness form the original, this version has better action, more nail biting moments, and better backstory. What I really loved about both of the FMA series' is their exploration on serious topics like war, redemption, death, human sacrifice, and humanity. This is what makes this shonen franchise so special becuz it touches important topics that no other shonens would explore as FMA focuses more on being serious. Ed and Winry's relationship is deeper here so it adds a bit of a romance. Brotherhood also had a better atmosphere as it had lots of scenes that would suck you right into the story. As for pacing, it starts off fast due to the first 13-15 episodes but after that the pacing was perfect. Not once did I feel that it started to slow down. Another huge advantage is that the ending here is far superior. It was way more satisfying and it left giving us everything it had to offer. After a long dramatic journey, the Elric brothers did everything they needed to do and all the other characters lived up to their potential. A lot of sacrifice, a lot of emotional scenes, Brotherhood ended the best way it could've.
Art:10/10
This is unfair to compare because this version is more recent but in general the animation is gorgeous. It focused more on animating things in the background, making the action sequences flawlessly smooth, with lots of movement. Most of the settings such as Amestris and the civilians look more realistic due to them being nicely detailed and with great amount of fluidity. The visual and special effects were far better making alchemical powers such as fire to look more realistic. And plus every character looks better here with all their features given more depth.
Sound:10/10
Like the 2003 series, this is an area where Brotherhood truly shines. An awesome soundtrack that I heavily enjoyed. While 2003's OST had more of a sad tone Brotherhood's OST was more epic that helped give the action that extra intensity. The first ending theme, ""Uso"" is one of my favorite themes in all of anime as well as the first opening theme, ""Again."" The voice acting was once again terrific with majority of the characters given their same VA although this time Al was given a female to do his voice. His VA however, did a great job and sounded a lot like the one from the original.
Character:10/10
Brotherhood did what was almost impossible; it made the cast BETTER. This version gave us some new characters that played key roles and made the series very enjoyable. The homunculi were also handled better and given different origins from the original that made more sense. They were likeable in the 2003 series due to their origins making them a lil more human, while in Brotherhood they were mainly evil and sadistic and made their deaths more satisfying to watch. What this also did however  was make them more of a villainous threat and added more conflict to the series. Hohenheim was also more relevant and given more of a backstory compared to the 2003 series. The biggest advantage was the main villain, Father. For one he's the most powerful character of the franchise, he has a stronger backstory with Hohenheim, his motives are more clear and understandable, and he had a bigger impact. Not only was he great, but I would put him among anime's best villains.
Final Verdict
Simply a masterpiece, Brotherhood imo was hands down the better adaptation. Better villains, better action, and waaaaay better ending, this was everything I wanted the original to be. It's hard to get two adaptions from the same franchise and not compare which is why I made a few comparisons. But in general this series blew me away. FMA: Brotherhood was not only great it's to me the greatest anime OF ALL TIME.  Ever since I got into this legendary franchise Ive become a huge fan of it. I do recommend watching both becuz although the original wasn't as great as Brotherhood, it still had emotional depth and in general it was very good. This is one anime that all fans must see.
Sub or Dub Recommendation: Dub",10
"
                Yeah, a heart made Fullmetal!
There is a reason that this series in ranked first among all anime! This show has surpassed all anime, including its original. Fullmetal Alchemist, the original was a nice show, but at times, it could become boring and it did. This one though... 
If you like the idea of the show, the existence of alchemy, you will fall in love with Brotherhood. It acquires the best story line out there: its fully understandable, relatable, lovable and it never bores you. The animation is fantastic, the soundtrack too, and it explains the laws and limits of Alchemy, making it look real! Also,
                  for people who like Dub, this one is perhaps the best ever dubbed anime!
Now that the technical description is over, its time for my description. My thoughts and feelings.
Oooh My God! I love this show sooo much! I love the story, I love the characters! As I was getting closer to the final episode, I was scared, terrified even. I didn't want to face the fact that the show would end. Or worse, the ending would suck. The thought was simply terrifying. Why, you may ask. Watching this anime, it felt like I wasn't just watching; I was living it through. It may sound stupid, but that is truly how I feel. The pain, the joy, the agony; everything Ed and Al felt, I felt too. I don't know if it's just me, but I bonded with this show. When my greatest fear came, the final episode, I was startled. I couldn't have picked a better ending for my favorite anime. I don't think anyone could have. It left me with a feeling I can't quite explain. It wasn't just one feeling. It was joy, sadness, nostalgia, happiness, pleasure, satisfaction, all fused together as one. It's a rare feeling. I spent months watching this show. It was all worth it. I wouldn't change a thing.
I wish I had the power to erase my memory. That way, I would erase the memory of watching it, then I would watch it again and again and again, and I would experience the same feeling, exactly like the first time.
All hail the king of Anime! The true gem among gems!",10

                THE Full Metal alchemist:Brotherhood.....
Where do I start..... How bout a sure shot epic ...legend.. THE BEst EVER?
The most awaited anime (hich earlier raised suspicions of being a rip-off or some bid to make money by the studio) of 2009 is by far the BEST anime the world has ever soon or at least one of the best.
ART: 8 (Ed with bleach yellow hair????) 
Earlier had problems with the slightly different character design (of Ed and Roy in particular) but later I got used to it. Otherwise the backgrounds and other characters were quite nicely drawn.
Sound: 9.5 (Awesome songs!!!!!TOO GOOD!!!!!!)
The seiyuu were pretty much the same
                  (though a change in Roy's seiyuu was disconcerting at first) and overall the voice acting was great. The background music was par excellence while the OPs and EDs were mind blowing. One could feel the FEEL of the series reverbating in the songs...
CHARCTER,STORY:10 (One word..... Legendary)
Brotherhood follows the plot of the orignal manga. The story is as flawless as the its source and perfect in all aspects. Though at first one may find its 10X speed a little too much but.... (again) on'll get used to it.There were a lot of new characters which added a new flavour to the series and gave the series a new dimension as compared to the first series. The plot,especially in the end is gripping and one is left marvelling at the genius of Hiromi Arakawa.... without and any gaps or loop holes (as seen in the end of the first anime adaptation).
ENJOYMENT: 10
X100 Action, X100 Comedy, X100 Emotion, X100 Awesomeness... 
What do you expect?
OVERALL:10
Side Note: Those who haven't watched the first series are requested to watch it first as it (at least in its first half elaborates on some skipped or shortened events).",10
"
                Where to begin with the epic thrill ride.
Each episode of this series kept me interested and developed the characters nicely in which you will definitely end up getting attached to at least one character throughout the series.
The storyline is epic and adventurous getting to see the Elric Brothers fight through their struggles in order to get their bodies back.
The series is realistic and believable and will not hesitate to give twists which were never expected, keeping the series interesting and unpredictable. 
I would highly recommend this series to any type of anime watcher and guarantee you will enjoy it and wont regret watching this series.

                ONCE AGAIN, LOOK OUT FOR SPOILERS.
Where do I begin? I was a bit reluctant to watch this series. When I was halfway through Fullmetal Alchemist, early last year, someone told me they were doing a new show more faithful to the manga. And I remember thinking ‘Crap, so why am I even bothering with this version?’. But I finished it, completed it with The Conqueror of Shambala and felt mildly satisfied. The series were brilliant apart from the eyebrow raising ending and the questionable movie plot. Only now that I’ve finished Brotherhood can I realize how far-fetched some arcs were but to each their own:
                  Fullmetal Alchemist was a good achievement, but it has to be considered as something with a life of it’s own, unattached to Arakawa-sensei’s work. A bit like Rurouni Kenshin:Seisohen: good work, but if you end up thinking about Watsuki-san’s work your stomach will turn over. But I was still undecided whether to watch this or not until some brilliant opportunity came up: final exams. Is there a better time to watch a 64 episode long series? I highly doubt it (as a matter of fact note only, I did pretty well on the exams, so no worries).
The main plot is very much like Fullmetal Alchemist‘s: Edward and Alphonse Elric are the sons of renowned alchemist Van Hohenheim and Trisha Elric. When their father leaves the house, Trisha slowly perishes and the boys try to resurrect her through alchemy, with disastrous consequences. Ed loses his leg and gives up his arm in order to retrieve Alphonse’s soul, attaching it to a suit of armour. The brothers embark on a journey through alchemy to learn ways of getting their bodies back, finding themselves in a situation they didn’t ask to be in but is closer to their hearts than they think.
However, the story changes drastically after Nina and Dr. Tucker’s arc, following the original work instead of making-up a story of its own. And I’m glad it did, because Tucker annoyed me incredibly in Fullmetal Alchemist. Brotherhood doesn’t include that questionable relationship between Scar and Lust, the far-fetched arc with Izumi’s son being an Homunculi with Ed’s arm and the whole thing about Envy being Ed and Al’s brother. Here, the Homunculi are simply Homunculi with no sappy past stories: although some of them have their own little personal tragedies, like Greed and, a favourite of mine, Envy, a character I’m sure everyone hated at first but actually felt sorry for in the end. This is another strong point in Brotherhood: the whole myriad of secondary characters that you can’t help but like. In fact, there isn’t a single character I didn’t like in the end, apart from Wrath who was just plain boring. Each character has their own purposes for fighting, something bigger than themselves moving them and each has a strong characteristic that makes them unique, whether it’s the little sparkles that float around Armstrong all the time (yes, they’re here too!) or Ling Yao’s constant hunger.
As for the main characters, Edward and Alphonse, they also endeavour on a physical and psychological journey that questions their sense of right and wrong and opens their eyes to what people can do as means to achieve a bigger end; in this case, something terrible personal wish. All the defects of men are here, personified in the Homunculi and in humans as well: vanity, ambition, selfishness, jealousy, envy. I think vanity and selfishness, thinking about what you want regardless of the others, are the most proeminent. If it weren’t for them, none of the characters would be in the mess they find themselves in. I think Alphonse develops more than Edward. He’s a personal favourite of mine, so I may be defending him, but he changes from a shy kid who lived in his brother’s shadow to a selfless albeit courageous young man, and this we can see when he decides to leave his body behind for a little while longer. He had everything he always wanted right in front of him, but someone else needed him most. It must’ve been a really tough decision not to be taken lightly. As for Edward, and I do like him as well, he evolves from a kid who thought he owned the world to someone who realizes the world is made up of ugly truths, but he doesn’t really apply this knowledge on himself. Sure, his final decision is very courageous as well, but I saw more maturity in Alphonse than in him. But then again, since Alphonse is one of my favourite characters, I might be biased. Tell me your opinions!
This show also brings Hohenheim to light, and he became another favourite of mine. Instead of the evil guy who makes Homunculi out of his offspring, we have a severly misunderstood man who craves for his sons acceptance and who, basically, started it all. He feels on his shoulders the responsibility to end it as well, alone; to his astonishment, he meets his sons along the way and their broken relationship is put to the test, to heart warming results. I also liked to see how Hohenheim and Edward are alike, not only in looks, as you will see on the photo below, but in attitude either: Ed hates being called small, Hohenheim hated being called stupid. They both reacted exactly the same way. The way they brag is also identical. It’s really a like father, like son story.
In the end, the good guys win and get everything they wanted but with a bittersweet touch. A very bittersweet touch. You will cry your eyes out in the end, this I guarantee. It’s really cathartic… in a way, it embodies everything Fullmetal Alchemist failed to bring.
Brotherhood is a nearly perfect show. The animation is superb (the fight scenes are so amazingly fluid they will make you want more and more), the soundtrack is magnificent and especially haunting in the most emotional scenes (especially in the final episodes) and you know the best thing? No fillers at all. It’s just plot moving forward episode after episode. I might just add something I think is very important here: the technical aspects of the show are impecable, like I just said, but this is one of those cases where the characters make the story. They simply shine and, in my sky, they will do so for a very long time.

                This is the best anime I have ever watched and I recommend it to anyone that is looking for an anime that has everything.
The thing that I liked the most about this anime is that it has the best character development I have seen so far. Every character of this show has the potential of being the main character of an anime, and it is not just because the characters are outstanding, but the story really brings out their potential. 
The story is just amazing and I have not found any flaws. I love how each character actually has a role in all this and
                  that there are no fillers. Nope, not a single filler character or irrelevant episode. I personally love how everything in this anime just goes along. The plot does not have any holes, and excitement and adventure lays in every episode. Hell, sometimes there was so much action in one episode that I felt I was going to explode.
I really love the way that this anime is so funny and yet so serious at the same time. It goes from abstract themes such as  questioning the existence of God, the aftermaths of a great war, the limits of humanity in a fantasy world to more mundane themes, like problems in a family and the strong bond between brothers.
I really love how we get the chance to witness how the character grow. The best character development of this show is the one of Greed, who is by far my favorite Homunculus and one of my favorite  characters. The whole Homunculus deal fits so well into this story, like everything does.
The art, the animation, everything is just so awesome and I really enjoyed this. This anime was the best experience ever and I hope that other people will enjoy it as well.",10
"
                Oh to be able to watch this anime again for the first time. After years and years of hearing of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood's well-earned popularity, I decided to give it a watch and ended up binging all 64 episodes in about two weeks. I miss curling up in my bed with only my Christmas lights and Christmas tree lighting up the room as I watched a good 4-5 episodes before bed.
That being said, I understand why this anime is popular and well-renowned, because it was an enjoyable and well-written story, and the experience was great. It is enjoyable watching the characters grow and evolve. The
                  fight scenes are exciting and well-animated. The anime still has time for slower, more emotional moments. And the plot is well-crafted, throwing hints and twists from the beginning that only make sense as the anime continues. I felt every range of emotion watching this anime, and I, quite frankly, didn't want the thrill to stop.
So, if I am throwing such praises, why did I only award FMAB a 9? Quite frankly, while this anime is enjoyable, I wouldn't say it is flawless. Here are a few issues of mine:
1. Pacing. I understand the beginning of the anime was fast-paced, because the anime assumed that the viewer had already seen the original Fullmetal Alchemist, so FMAB didn't want to waste its time getting into the swing of things. I actually thoroughly enjoyed this faster pacing in the beginning, so when the anime began to slow down as time went on, I find myself growing a bit more impatient for more to happen. That being said, this wasn't a large issue.
2. Female characters. Just wanted to say that I ADORE all the female characters in this anime and that I appreciate how they are handled in a manner that isn't sexist or fetishized. That being said, as time went on, I realized...I'm not even sure this anime passes the Bechdel test. That is rather unfortunate, because these are strong female characters, but that was a disappointing realization to make. The female characters deserved much more screen time than they were given.
3. The Final Battle. The ending of this anime was phenomenal, but, there was this continual back and forth between defeat and success, where every time the viewer believes the battle has been won, there's another way that the enemy returns, and quite frankly, after 30+ minutes or so of this, I was annoyed and wanted the battle to just reach its conclusion.
These were my major concerns, but they still didn't take away too greatly from my viewing experience. I definitely recommend, if you have not seen the anime already. It's a classic, for sure.",9
"
                I completed the anime in 3 days and I would say that it's my second favorite anime. 
Story : 10
 The story is OUTSTANDING. It's really amazing. It is a beautifully crafted plot.
Aside from that, I don't really have to say any critics about it.
Art : 9
  It's not as colourful as another anime I've watched, but it's still pretty great.Sound : 10
  I LOVED the sound. The producers made a really good job on this. Each sound was put in the right place at the right moment.
Character : 10
  The character developement of each characters that were important to the plot had amazing character developement. I liked Edward Elric's design. It's realistic compared to most protagonists. I liked also his brother's design too.
The producers even made children look badass. Their childhood friend had a much more active role in the plot.
Enjoyment : 10
I didn't feel laid back while watching. I could really feel the characters' feelings. I really enjoyed watching the show (even though it had gore and a lot of blood, I don't really mind).
Overall : 10
It was a pleasure meeting and watching this anime. This has been a beautiful experience.",10

                This is the first time I actually feel like writing a review, and I’m very much aware that I won’t be saying anything that it hasn’t been said before. But I just had to. Why? well, I have been avoiding to watch this anime for years, mainly because I don't really like the design of the characters and when it comes to manga/anime, I tend to chose stories with Japanese  settings. But recently I decided to give it a chance, since it’s usually a very well positioned show in all the rankings.  I guess I wanted to know why…
So now that I’ve finally
                  watched Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, I can openly say that it is one of the most overrated shows of all times.  Please don’t get me wrong, I liked it, I really did. It’s not a bad show, it’s actually pretty good one, but I just can’t understand how it is so high on the list.  The story is good, the plot develops very skillfully. It’s a very epic show if “epicness” is what you’re looking for. However, for people like me, who may be more attracted by getting emotionally involved with the story and characters…. It just doesn’t feel enough.  This show could have been much more awesome if it had been given the time to deepen into the background of the characters. I just felt that most of the characters were plain and barely half developed. There are very nice characters with a lot of potential, but their personality just seems incomplete. This is very frustrating especially in the case of the “villains”. There you have a bunch of characters that could have been really badass but they are just purposeless. Their background, their psychological basis, their ulterior motives were almost inexistent. I really don’t know if it was a failure of the plot or if it was a failure of the adaptation that failed to embody their means and motivations.… Which, by the way, was way better constructed in the previous anime adaptation of Full Metal Alchemist.  In the previous adaptation, the homunculi had a more complex origin and a very contradicting nature, which made them way more interesting than they are in Botherhood. For instance, characters as Lust or Izumi, which were very charismatic in FMA due to their background story, are just empty shells in Brotherhood.  That’s pretty sad, because at the end you see the characters suffering and you get like “who are you again?”. At the end of the show I just felt I had not really been given the chance to truly get to know any of these characters, so I didn’t really care that much of what would happen to them.  In FMA I was really moved by most of the characters’ circumstances, but in Brotherhood it was like… yep, ok, this fight is sooo epic, but who was fighting again? What for?...
In addition FMA had those twisted scenes… kind of dark situations that came out of nowhere (let’s call them “small and subtle creepy Nina-like scenes” if you know what I mean) that would leave us all wondering what the heck did just happened and how such a nice show can become so creepy in just a second and immediately turn back to normal as if nothing had happened. That was pretty awesome in FMA, and there was no trace of that awesomeness in Brotherhood. 
Maybe I’m comparing the two animes a little too much, but I actually watched FMA after watching FMAB, and I just can’t help to think that there should be a third adaptation mixing the two previous shows. THAT could be the best show ever if they do it right.
So yep, leaving FMA aside for now, about Brotherhood I can say: yes, it’s a good story. Yes, it’s worth watching. Yes, after watching it you will look back and think “it was a good anime” . Plus it has a cool soundtrack, with very cool openings and endings, which is always appreciated.  But, if you watch it, do not expect it to be the best anime ever, because it is not.",7

                This series was the first anime show I’ve watched in a very long time, by no means am I in any way an expert in judging a show like this - but here I go anyway:
10 Things I Like and Don’t Like about FullMetalAlchemist: Brotherhood
(SPOILERS)
LIKE
1. The Homunculi
Oh god, do I love the homunculi. A fantastic collection of evil adversaries; every time they appeared on screen I would simply gush with both angst and excitement, scared by both the often deceiving appearance and sheer evil of these characters. They’re all powerful in their own right, each of them, of course, embodying one of the seven deadly
                  sins. I still think Lust might have been taken out too early, as it is one of the more relevant and interesting sins in my opinion, but sadly she is one of the first to be taken out and does not make a return. The scenes with Gluttony are really harrowing and nasty, I definitely have had a nightmare or two with him chasing me with his slimy tongue out since I began watching. The Homunculi are terrific villains, they easily overpower our heroes, who then have to use a combination of their intellect and abilities to figure out how to survive. This creates a lot of tension, as it is quite difficult to picture how the homunculi could possibly be beaten. This, along with the two brothers quest for their original bodies, is a great locomotive for the overall narrative. A+
2.  The Fights
So many great battles on this show; Ling and Edward fighting Envy after being swallowed by Gluttony (and then teaming up to get out of there), King Bradley’s return to Central (first fighting with Buccaneer, Foo and Greedling, then the amazing final face-off with Scar), the battle in the darkened forest with Pride and Gluttony, Sloth fighting with the Briggs soldiers in the North - later with the Armstrong siblings in Central. I really could keep going for a long time here, I haven’t even mentioned the final battle with Father. This show is stacked with fight scenes that ooze quality; the slick up-tempo animations, the imaginative counter-attacks and the genuinely surprising outcomes of each fight - FMA:B always keeps you guessing, ensuring that the fight sequences rarely gets dull or repetitive. 
A
3. The Humor
FMA:B deals with a variety of dark subjects throughout the 64 episodes, but there are also moments of wit and humor that often succeed in keeping the mood light and informal. This is often done by using running gags; FullMetals height (and lack thereof), the ‘animal instincts’ of the friendly chimeras, Major Armstrong's surprising sensitivity, Barry the Chopper's insane behavior, Winry’s temper - just to name a few. There was a couple of times where I felt the humor fell a little flat, but for the most part, I found myself laughing. 
A-  
4. The Flashbacks
A lot of the character development on FMA:B happens through flashbacks, where we learn about the origins of each important character. These moments are often haunting and vivid, the story of Ishval and it’s alchemic destruction, told through different perspectives, really made an impression on me. This backstory completely shifts the perception of Scar, the villain of the first part of the story. Suddenly you feel deep compassion towards him and his people, and when it is later revealed that the sole purpose of this destruction was to harness the energy of all his fellow citizens of Ishval, it’s hard not to feel the empathy - in spite of Scar’s recklessness in the beginning. The Elric Brothers’ attempt to bring back their late mother using the transmutation circle is equally poignant; the hideous creature that emerges from the other side is so… wrong, it was hard to shake off that experience. You can only imagine what it must have been like for the two boys. The story of King Bradley along with the tellings of the Dwarf in the Flask and Van Hohenheim also works quite well, I actually would have liked some more flashbacks, specifically with Ling Yao and the country of Xing, which never really gets explored in detail. 
A+    
5. The music and sound effects
I really liked the theme songs of the earlier episodes (“again"" by YUI, ""Uso"" by SID, “Hologram” by NICO Touches the Walls), but as the show progressed I found most of the other themes to be of lesser quality for some reason, I guess they just didn’t appeal to me. The orchestral music used during the episodes is often sentimental and grandiose, which I actually liked, as it fit the over-the-top nature of the narrative pretty well. The audio effects applied to the voices of some the monsters and villains are brilliant and really adds something to the atmosphere and vibe. 
B+  
There was one character whose sound annoyed me, which brings me to things I don’t like about the show.       
DON’T LIKE
6. The voice of Alphonse Elric
The squeaky and high-pitched voice of Alphonse Elric was a continuous source of frustration while watching the show. I should mention that I watched the show with English speaking voice actors, I would have preferred Japanese voices, but the English subtitles was simply not idiomatic, which made the switch necessary. Now, I generally enjoyed the voice acting, but hearing Alphonse scream out ‘BROTHER!’ over and over again was really tough to go through. I don’t know if it’s the high level of resonance applied to give the voice a more metallic feel (he is a walking armour after all), but the sound of his voice ripped through my ears regardless of the intentions. The same was not the case when he got his original body back, then the voice was just ‘regular annoying’ if you will, but this happens so late in the story that it could take away from the experience. 
D-
7. The under-utilization of alchemy
When we first get introduced to alchemy, we see Scar going after the state alchemists, who defend themselves in creative ways using their alchemy. Very imaginative vistas of elements clashing together, flying around in all sorts of shapes. Alchemy seems very powerful in combat right off the bat, which is why it is so odd to me that it’s not more present in the later fight sequences. There is a lot of old school fighting going on, especially from FullMetal, who seems to be constantly parrying off attacks instead of initiating them himself and using his powers creatively. At first, there seem to be infinite possibilities when using alchemy, these, unfortunately, do not get explored to the fullest. C+ 
8. The over-explanation of plot points
This is what happens when you watch a show that originally aired once a week on a binge; plot points you probably would have forgotten about in the span of a week are instead crystal clear in your mind, and the repetitive explanation of the important twists and turns becomes a drag. I can’t really fault the creators for this one, as I can understand the wish to ensure that everyone could follow this sometimes intricate storyline, but nonetheless, it was something that dumbed down the experience for me. 
B-
9. The demise of the homunculi 
I’ve already expressed my opinion of the homunculi, who seemed so terrifyingly strong, so undeniable in their coldness towards humans, that their downfall just had to be a letdown. They die too easily. If this was a video game, Roy Mustang would be overpowered. He ends up slaying Lust and Envy with such ease, which poses the question “why doesn’t he just do this to all the homunculi and get it over with?”. All he has to do is check the sky for rainy clouds. This would, of course, bypass the whole structure of the story, but it seems outright foolish to me that he spends so much time in Central Command doing nothing but waiting for such a large chunk of the story. 
C     
10. The army of lesser homunculi
Okay, I've come to the realization that I have some general problems with the ending of this story, which the army of brainless homunculi exemplifies quite well. The continuous production of philosophers stones seems to have had the purpose of creating this army. They get introduced in the story a fair amount of time before it begins to conclude, and then we forget about them again, only to have them appear as FullMetal and co. are making their way towards the confrontation with Father. They get activated prematurely and immediately proceed to kill their supposed commander. Then they start pouring out of every opening, rising to their feet after being shot and beaten - they are immortal. We never know how many of them there are, or how exactly they are defeated, as we just see our protagonists fight them off - never really destroy them. This zombie-like army only provides another cosmetic obstacle, it never becomes interesting or vital to the plot what happens to them. The reason as to why they have been created also begins to become fuzzy. Father literally swallows God, and if this was his plan all along, why would he need an army? He could extinguish entire countries with a mere thought. It’s only a problem because the show generally attempts to explain a lot about itself, and this simply seems like nothing but a cheap story tool used to make it a little harder for the heroes to come out victorious.

                I have started watching FMA a few years ago and I dropped it after a few episodes, it's not that I didn't like it, I just didn't really find it appealing. My friend told me a week ago that I should try out FMA:Brotherhood and I gave it a shot. Oh my god, the story, the atmosphere, the characters... It all just got to me. It does funny moments incredibly well, but where it shines is it's depressing moments. It will make you feel so attached to the characters and you will feel their motives for doing what they need to do. Overall this is
                  one of the best animes I've seen and one of the most enjoyable experiences. I cannot recommend it more.",10

                It's very hard to get great manga and give it justice with an anime, as we can constantly witness in countless anime. Censors, fillers, etc; they get what we love and in one too many occasions ruin it.
This is definitely not one of those cases. In fact, its the exact opposite. Following the criteria of ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it"", Bones Studios gets the flawless FMA manga and delivers us a nearly perfect adaptation, following the manga closely with very few deviations. 
Fluid animation makes the already intense battles just so much more impactful.
The characters are imperfect and relatable, each have their different
                  motive for doing what they do and it's not just to move forward the plot. You want to understand the characters, and you are invited to do just so.
The story is as intriguing as in the manga, and the conclusion to the series is just damn well beautiful.
No matter what genres you prefer, this series is a must watch. Those 64 episodes will pass before you even realize it ands when its over I'll be damned if you aren't teary eyed and all warm and fuzzy inside.",10

                So Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood...
I remember my cousin and i, big fans of the original fma, watching a couple episodes in english and him saying ""It's cute but yeah no thanks..."" 
So i watched the whole season in Japanese, and coincidentally so did his older brother. So when we were all together again (because they are both in the Marines) we we're talking about how f-ing awesome it is. 
So the story ends about 30 hours and $200 later with us having bought all the seasons and watched it that week. 
Incredible story. Great voice acting dub (Funimation delivers almost 100% of the time) . If
                  you haven't watched it you're seriously missing out.",10

                *Mild Spoilers*
This was the second anime I watched, after Sword Art Online, and I'm so glad I did. Coming off of SAO, I was quite dejected with Anime. Really? This was it? 
Then I watched some of this at a friends house, and honestly it was a blast.
The story was engaging, I loved the world building and the political, ethical, physical, mental and moral outcomes it questioned. 
I really enjoyed the characters, and in a way you could compare the couple of the show, Edward and Winry to SAO's Kirito and Asuna.
Both Edward and Kirito are trapped in something out of their control, both are
                  very powerful and both are arrogant. But here's where it differs. Edwards source of his power his also his weakness, what made him stronger scared him and his brother physically and mentally, and I don't think they'll ever recover. It was used as character development, something Kirito heavily lacks. Both believe themselves better then others, but we see Edward plead. We see him agonise over what he's done. Not with Kirito. 
Asuna is great, she has a well of potential, but it's never used. Winry helps, she hinders and she grows as a person. Their both tough and confidant, but we see winery's hobbies a lot more and much more of the doubt and uncertainty she suffers. 
Seriously, I could go on about full metal for a while, so I end it with this, what it.",9

                As you can tell by the ratings, i loved this anime.The story line is excellent as you see the brothers struggle to get there body's back and how cruel the world is to them.The music is fantastic i had to download it to my iPod just so i could listen to it.
The characters are amazing, i have fallen in love the characters of Edward and Alphonse, but what i really enjoyed about this anime is that you can actually see the characters getting older, and they are not afraid to kill off characters so be warned, this series will make you cry.
Overall this is my
                  favorite anime, when the box set came out i had to buy it just so i can re watch it over and over gain.Its just that amazing, i am very glad that i started to watch this, but at the same time im glad i watched Fullmetal alchemist first before brotherhood because it made me appreciate it more.",10

                The Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is certainly one of the most important anime of the decade, which must be its very above average quality at various points. First I would like to highlight, one of the most organic, stuck and connected plot I've ever seen. Its story is digestible to a wide audience, sometimes even complex, but this can not be considered as a negative point, quite the contrary, is very interesting for those who delve into the work. And of course one of the strongest points of the work, the characters. The fullmetal characters are quite interesting, charismatic and you can easily create a strong
                  attachment bond, even an evil character like jealousy can rise from interesting. Another interesting thing is the turn of the story, at various points in the work, you may be surprised and this point is something that should be highlighted. One thing that can not miss in battle, its fights and animation. Fullmetal is very lively, its features have a great flow and good graphic quality in most of its episodes, and if you consider the year of release, you will find that fullmetal has one of the best animations. And lastly, your soundtrack. A fullmetal soundtrack is epic, exciting and And it has a good placement, blends perfectly with a plot and like scenes. That's without regard for openings and endings songs that are wonderful. A negative point in my view is a comedy. A fullmetal comedy is repetitive and goes beyond many moments, not to mention that sometimes they are placed in dangerous environments, but of course or with a bad feeling about me, may be good for you. From this we can conclude that fullmetal is an extremely important anime and has an enviable quality, but it can be subjectively bad at some point. However, tomorrow is undeniable quality and creativity. A work that must be seen by all.",10

                I'll be short because this is a famous anime.
Characters are well developed and my favourite part of the anime. All of them are maturely handled and none of them acts like a cliched anime character. I prefer dub over the sub on this one because of the amazing performance of the actors.
Almost everything is done right except the beginning of the show. The show is great after episode 13, not before it. It seems rushed to me. In the older FMA, those 13 episodes are described in detail. If someone watches this one without watching the older FMA they might find those first 13 episodes
                  painful to watch.",9

                FMA:Brotherhood, to me, is the equivalent of classical music (think Beethoven, Mozart, etc.), but for the world of anime. If anime still exists hundreds of years from now, people will still remember FMA:B for being a classic, industry-defining masterpiece. 
While newer, flashier things might come along to steal the spotlight for a while, FMA:B will return to the top with the same certainty that the sun rises each morning. While I'm concerned that this anime might never be surpassed in my eyes, it brings me great satisfaction to know that I discovered it, enjoyed it, and remember it. FMA:B  had everything I ever wanted,
                  and then some.
This review may contain some spoilers, so if you haven't watched it yet I suggest you stop reading reviews on MAL and just get started on the show. You won't regret it.
In fact, one of the main reasons I watch anime is to continuously search for an anime that can exceed this one. While a few others have been very good contenders for the top spot on my anime list, FMA: B is still the best, bar none. It is somehow able to exist as both a highly entertaining action-packed shounen and a deeply philosophical anime that explores light and dark themes masterfully. 
I feel that this anime, unlike many others which are heavy on philosophy, is able to send powerful messages without being too explicit or giving any lectures. It just shows you things, and it feels organic... almost real sometimes.
In addition to the excellent story, the anime looks and sounds absolutely excellent. The fully orchestrated soundtrack in particular is one of the, if not the best OST ever created for an anime. And while the art may not be as technically impressive as some of the titles you see today, overall I feel that it's aged wonderfully and will still look and sound great when I rewatch it as an old man one day.
Another thing that I truly love about FMA:B is that none of the huge beloved cast of characters of the show are wasted. Unlike many other shounen, where awesome characters are used and disposed of like cans of beer at a frat party, FMA:B finds amazing ways to tie everyone (including villains) and everything together at the end of the series and it's just... beautiful. No matter who you are, you will find someone to root for in the world of FMA:B.
I feel that I could fill an entire library of ideas explored by FMA:B. Here are some things that come to mind, thinking about the show:
- themes exploring hopelessness, despair over a meaningless existence, and the false promises of manmade religion 
- brutal examples of the results of careless scientific experimentation
- demonstration of the brutality of corrupt governments/militaries, and the dangers they pose to the entire world
- exploration of the idea of entropy, physics, chemistry, the conservation of mass and energy, and a bit of buddhism even
- exploration of the seven deadly sins from western philosophy/religion, in both personification and plotlines: gluttony, sloth, lust, greed, envy, wrath, and pride
- an ideal ratio of comedy and tragedy between the episodes. A great mixture of laughs, tears, and feels.
- the power and epic feeling of the people of a country or society working together for the common good
- heartbreaking stories of redemption, bravery, and self sacrifice
- incredible demonstrations of the contrast between hatred/nihilism and the power of love
Yes, despite being ""just"" 64 episodes, FMA:B somehow explores all of these things, and then some in very interesting ways. FMA:B is not just a shounen, but a story about the light and dark of humanity, its relation to the universe, and the unchangeable laws of nature that govern our existence. You get all this alongside the other good stuff that good shounen is known for -- awesome fight scenes, jokes, and a satisfying sense of progression through character development. 
There was even character development on the villain side! I found it brilliant how the homunculi all died in a unique way pertinent to their given sin, and only realized it from a youtube comment. Consider:
- Lust died from someone protecting the one they love
- Gluttony died from being eaten
- Sloth died lying on the ground without the energy to move or regenerate himself
- Envy committed suicide in self pity, realizing all the things he never had
- Pride died when he was forced to humble himself by taking a human body
- Wrath died on a battlefield in peace
- Greed gave up possession of a body and sacrificed himself for others
If you really try to pick the show apart, you can find a few flaws, but none of them are serious enough to derail this masterpiece. While FMA:B might take a few episodes to get going, it has an incredible momentum that will hit HARD on the final episodes. 
The main downside to FMA is that if you watch it, you will eventually run out of episodes to watch. The joy of going through an anime for the first time is a precious, but ephemeral thing. But despite that emptiness you may feel a few hours after finishing the last episode, I think you will find a sense of satisfaction that you got to experience the best anime of all time.",10
"
                Well, before watching this anime, I always had a prejudice, because people always say, ""This is a perfect anime, it's the best anime."" It bothered me, until I stopped that prejudice and watched the play completely.
History: Absurdly incredible and well detailed. The anime has a story well explored and what makes it even better, the world is explored in more than one dimension. When watching, you follow the map and the locations where the protagonists pass. This makes the work rich, as it is concerned with exploring and explaining the world where the story takes place.
Art: To be honest, I do not really like the
                  art of FMAB, it bothers me a bit the absence of traits and details, even though I know it's a rather old manga. My grade is 10, regardless of my taste, I do not think the bad trait, but if it were for my taste, it would not be so.
I am obliged to praise the animation, for an anime of 2010, the production of Bones Inc is to be congratulated by the excellent quality!
Sound Production: I've never emphasized this, but I think it's worth mentioning the wonderful and well-produced openings. I do not see much of anything on the soundtracks. Of my favorite ""battle shounens"" anime, maybe that's the least I think about when it comes to OST's. The soundtrack is cool, it works, it has some epics, but nothing different.
Characters: Well, I think 10 is more than faint, but only one character bothers me: ""Al"", for being with the protagonist all the time, I expected more of him, even though he had good moments of development, but were few and unique to just one character. It was almost unimportant to him during 90% of the anime.
The other characters, wonderful, the Sins, in this case the homunculi, are perfect, with the exception of some like Lust. All of them, including Mustang and Ed, have great developments!
One thing I have not seen in almost any other work, was something that FMAB did, which is to put the secondary characters as one, including the protagonist. This makes them all important and part of the plot, having a beautiful connection between them, in the technical part!
FMAB may not be very nice at first, the fact that it is too rushed and almost does not present the characters ends up bothering much, but still, as of episode 10, the anime changes and shows its potential!
The author of FMAB is not one of my favorite mangakas, even so, she has my full respect. He managed to do a fantastic work from beginning to end, with ecellent characters and a wonderful story!",10
"
                To be honest. I don't really understand how Brotherhood has a higher mal score than the 2003. I really don't get the appeal of Brotherhood
Main characters: Edward is literally annoying in this version. He overreacts and is constantly screaming. Atleast the 2003 Edward actually matures, especially in Conqueror of Shamballa. But anyways let's talk about Alphonse and to be honest, I think Alphonse is the same in both versions.
Tone:  The show mixes over-the-top goofiness with extremely dark imagery and themes. It's like whenever the shows feels like it, it flips a switch and the style / tone suddenly changes. I find the effect doesn't
                  work and it just annoys me because it breaks whatever emotion or immersion I was experiencing at the time.
Plot: The plot is really slow and it has no deep meanings unlike the 2003 version. The early episodes were just rushed versions of 2003 episodes with a little tweaks. But anyways to sum up what I said: The plot is rushed.
Now on the positive side:
I really like the sound/music and I like the art style and animation. Mustang is also more likeable in this version. And he is more badass. And Hawkeye is a better character in this version than the 2003 version",6
"
                To be honest I have to say I am quite disappointed I just finished watching Fullmetal Alchemist original and it's better even with less episodes. I am on episode 8 currently and things feel very rushed and confusing and a lot of things are left out that are in the original yes the animation is better but it losses a lot of pretty important details and makes the characters feel weird non-human. If you want to watch Fullmetal Alchemist I strongly suggest you watch the original 'Fullmetal Alchemist' first. It's better and things make more sense and characters feel more reasonable It's what I liked
                  about Fullmetal alchemist everything makes sense there is a reason behind everything yet this anime is lacking in it.",4
"
                I have seen both the original FMA and fully watched FMAB. I highly recommend FMAB over the original mainly due to the plot. As Fullmetal Alchemist the original had a compelling story with details and description it wasn't true to the manga and definitely left major plot holes with an ending without much explanation. However, the movie that goes with the original does give more explanation (Conqueror of Shambala). 
Aside from that, Fullmetal Alchemist; Brotherhood gave great details and explanation to the plot line, the concept of alchemy and also how alchemy and Alkahestry is used. The characters all had their very strange and very
                  compelling personalities that somebody could relate to in one way or another (especially since I am a smart hot-head who hates milk).  Another good point that I would recommend FMAB is that the story stays true to the manga over the original as the manga story line is almost identical to the story line of FMAB (with minor differences as all anime-manga have). 
Overall, I recommend Fullmetal Alchemist; Brotherhood for it's greatly detailed plot with amazingly personality characters and explanation for it's mysteries as well as it gives a touching look on brothers who stick together and faithful friends who may constantly get mad at you (Winry).",10
"
                I originally started this show and was put off by how they seemed to rush some of the most important parts of the first series but after the story went into different areas I began to see how much better anime could be. This series is a masterpiece, better than the first in every way. Every character is back with new stories that help define them in ways the first never did. New characters add even more layers to a complex, vibrant world that seems more real this time around. Even the hero moments stand out more. This is the definitive version of the best
                  anime ever made.",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood: A spoiler free review. 
   I have two sisters. One three years older, the other three years younger. I don't know what it's like to have a brother. I have friends I call brothers, but at the end of the day, they are just guy friends I can trust to be in my apartment when I'm not there. But I do know what it's like to be a brother. I know what it feels like to be responsible for another's safety and well-being. My younger sister is my best friend. She is the most important person in my life. And
                  like Ed to Al, I would give anything to ensure her safety. I understood Ed immediately. And that is the true strength of Fullmetal.
   Don't get me wrong, there is a lot to love about this show. The pacing, the world building, the interesting use of not only alchemy but how some use it different than others depending on their personalities. The music is on point, the villains are interesting and the heroes are not heroes but heroic people. So I can safely say this show is a solid 7-8 out of ten. But it gets the solid 9 for its representation of sibling relationships. 
   This is a person you grew up with. Shared a home with, made a bond with. A promise, a rise to arms if the duty calls. You would give your blood, your life, your very existence to make sure this person you are closest to is safe. Is happy. We all like to think we would jump at the call to fight for what's right like Ed and Al. We all like to think we would take the chance and save the world. But not all of us would. Not all of us are heroes. And that's okay. But if you have siblings, especially if you are an older sibling, I think you will really see the strength in this series. Because it sold me in the very first moments of the show what it means to be an older brother. To feel responsible for this helpless youth. You would walk the edges of the world for them. And even though we may not all jump to arms to save the world, I think almost everyone would jump into hell to protect their sibling.
 I know I would.",9
"
                In short, this is the most overrated show you will ever see, most reviews and ratings here describe it as a masterpiece, which is obviously a big lie from this show's fanboys. It's just an average show with generic plots.
Based on reviews, I've planned to watch this show, with very high expectations. The surprise was that this show is so boring, that you can sleep in the first 10 min. So I decided to write this review, so maybe it can help anyone put this show in its correct place and not expect much from it.
The mini plots and scenarios are childish, which are not
                  suitable for the matures. It has a lot of screaming, which their pathetic approach to achieve comedy. The drama in this show has no effort, so they tell some bad stuff about a character with a generic sad music in the background, expecting you to feel instant empathy for the characters (they present these things, while I feel like, ok, this happened, long time ago, get over it already, good for you or not don't care actually, who is this guy in the first place), followed by some screams to make you laugh, then you can have the action sequence (so, I say to myself, get ready it's getting good now), but you see dumb moves with very poor animation and sound effects, then another chunk of annoying screams (not sure, but maybe this show has founded the concept of screams = comedy, that I can see in some other shows). Another thing when they want to present powerful character, they make kill some guys instantly somehow (while I'm thinking, ok, can't they do the same stuff for him), my point is that there is no effort in presenting the aspects of characters.
Story: 1, presented in a dull way, that I couldn't get attached to it at all.
Art: 1, I thought it was some Chinese art.
Sound: 1, just any cheap soundtracks.
Character: 1, they just want you to feel empathy for them, but they didn't make an effort to do so.
Enjoyment: 1, boring.",1
"
                I would never deny that I haven't fantasized about being an alchemist or never being interested in alchemy. I also think that there are many others who share this opinion. Watching this only made me all the more interested and fascinated by alchemy.
Full great life lessons, watching this made me realize things that I hadn't thought of before. Starting with characters you'll get attached to, a great story encompassing the plots and twists that'll leave you waiting for what happens next, a roller coaster of emotions that makes you feel great laughing and makes you feel no shame in crying. An action-packed anime bound to
                  leave you wanting more.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is amazing. It follows the story of the manga and that is an incredible story. 
Bones animated this series and they did an excellent job, I really liked how Envy's ""true form"" (the huge green body of dinosaur, head of dog thing with the bodies of the people that were used to create the philosophers stone) was drawn, and I also liked how the Elric brothers were drawn. You will either love a character or hate them... or have a love/hate relationship with them *cough cough Kimblee*
This anime will have you laughing until you cry and also have you crying your eyes
                  out if you get touched by stories. There are some really funny moments thrown in there and some feel breakers. The story is incredible and at times it has you wondering if some villains are all that bad... 
FMAB also has a great cast list in sub and dub like 
SUB
Romi Park
Rie Kugimiya
Yuuichi Nakamura
Mamoru Miyano
DUB
Vic Mignogna
Maxey Whitehead
Todd Haberkorn
Colleen Clinkenbeard
Travis Willingham
You will become completely hooked on this anime and it's kind of impossible to hate it. But I highly recommend it because it's incredible and the animation is quite similar to Hiromu Arakawa's original artwork in the manga. (Not that, that has anything to do with it XD)
But if you have nothing to watch, go watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood it doesn't matter if you haven't seen the first anime just watch it and enjoy the awesomeness.",10

                Synopsis: Alchemy is the art of transforming matter. However, in order to create something, the alchemist has to present something of equal value; this is the golden rule of alchemy. After losing their mother to a disease, Edward and Alphonse Elric try to resurrect her, an illegal taboo in the world of alchemy. Through the unsuccessful process Edward loses his arm and his leg and has to transmute Alphonse’s soul (which lost its body,) to a suit of armor. Afterward the two set off on a journey to find the legendary philosopher’s stone and use its magic to reunite with their bodies. In the process
                  Edward joins the army and a much bigger plot unfolds.
The Highlights
Foils: Brilliantly highlight the characteristics of the main characters.
Visuals: Stunning even for a Bones‘ production.
Music: For the most part good; in some instances beautiful.
Philosophical references: Read some of the works of Kant and Schopenhauer and you will truly appreciate this masterpiece.
Main characters: Always true to their personalities and characteristics.
Action scenes: Masterful; the cherry on top of all the other great qualities.
Symbolism: Is this anime or poetry?
The final scene: Words cannot properly describe it.
What is the truth in morality and life? Who is truly “good” and “evil”? Through the journey of two young boys, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood comes up with its own answers to these questions; and quite successfully.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood took all the impressive qualities from the first series and simply polished them. In the process of doing so, it practically eliminated all weaknesses from the first series and created a true work of art. The misplaced comedy was removed. Nearly no scenes which are intended to be dramatic are accompanied by slapstick humor. Brotherhood‘s visuals are of a considerably higher caliber and so are its action scenes. What truly separates FMA: Brotherhood from its original counterpart however is the way in which it explores profound philosophical themes. The level of depth in Brotherhood‘s story is astounding. It avoids any form of fillers, unlike the original, and uses every single one of its episodes effectively. Take any episode out of FMA: Brotherhood and it will be missing a vital organ in its body.
FMA: Brotherhood is essentially an exploration into morality and the many philosophical ideals that have governed humanity. Edward and Alphonse’s journey to regain their bodies is symbolic of the show’s journey to build a true moral body of its own. In the act of regaining their bodies, Edward and Alphonse must also build on their ideals and morality. The various characters in their journey each bring their own ethics to the table. In General Armstrong and Fort Briggs we see an influence from Darwin‘s survival of the fittest. In “Father” we see Nietzsche‘s philosophy of the “ubermensch” (the super person who has the power and the right to rise above all those weaker than him.) The philosophical references are endless; ranging from Schopenhauer‘s “will to be” and pessimism, to Hume‘s skepticism. The true merit of this anime’s philosophical journey however lies not only in the various references but in its answer to all the questions. It does not simply throw a bunch of references out there to appear intellectual. It brings all of them together in order to give its own answer. An answer which eventually takes the side of Kantian philosophy in stating that the true “goodness” of our actions lies in our intention.
Too many animes have such flatness in their characters, that they could easily be likened to what they actually are: pixels. FMA‘s characters are not just complex but contain an incredible honesty in themselves. Their personalities are alive and carry on throughout the entire series. Even when characters change, they do it in a way unique to their own being. The amount of detail and effort this show puts into characters is astonishing. Even the foils are among the best in anime. Never is a character brought forth without delivering a crucial message to the story.
On top of the wondrous substance are also breathtaking aesthetics. I enjoyed every single one of the introduction and ending theme songs, and the background music can at times be beautiful. The action sequences are accompanied by intense tunes and detailed sound effects. The visuals are absolutely fantastic, even for Bones. The landscapes and towns are visually stunning, the clothes and character designs are thought out to the finest detail, and facial expressions are shown with a carefulness few anime can match.
Fullmetal Alchemist is so much more than what this review writes of it. There is only so much I can say without spoiling it. That is what great anime do. Fullmetal Alchemist is one of those few anime in which a fan of literature such as myself can find a substance and profundity that parallels that of a great novel. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood tells the story of a boy who, through his outer and inner journey, will establish an understanding of the moral essence which connects every human being.",10

                Is it fair to be number one on the ""TOP Anime"" list tier ? 
WARNING : THIS IS MY OPINION YOU COULD AGREE OR NOT IT'S YOUR CHOICE. So, first time I started watching FMA BROTHERHOOD it was still 2016, it didn't satisfy  me  or my  interest throughout 17 episodes so I had to drop it, next time I tried it was a year later made it to 23 episodes and it still could not give me what I wanted, so all those years I've wondered why was this anime on top of the list? what was so interesting about it that
                  people adored and I could not ? I almost felt very bad about myself and started asking questions whether or not I was dumb to understand the concept behind the show. I literally glued myself on a seat to watch it until the end, but I never understood why was this anime better than all time classics that we all love and I found the answer I am going to get to it soon.
So without getting into minor details that we all see in the anime and I don't wanna spoil them, the show starts with a very good phase it has everything it needs a) seriousness b) emotional background c) equivalent exchange alchemy rule that makes sense d) good story buildup e) purpose. When you start watching the anime what you really want to see are those 5 reasons (especially for me), if it doesn't approach to your ""soul"" the way you want then you can't finish it either and this is what this anime started to lack after one or two episode later when it becomes literal comedy show with a very small dose of the information you want to see BECAUSE that is the reason why you started watching this show RIGHT? to see whether or not they can get their bodies back and who's the villain and what does he want. So I  was very frustrated,I saw very little and anticipated  more, because it's  NUMBER ONE on the list isn't it? it became more annoying to hear ""NII SAN""  from Alphonse every time Ed was in a minor danger, so ""NII SAN"" became a true nightmare for me. I also could not understand why was Alphonse breathing while running or getting tired if he did not have a body, and why were some of the characters killed of way too bad like Crimson Alchemist, he had the stone swallowed inside of him and could not cure a chimera bite with it and died very soon, what I really wanted to see was Scar face to face to Kimblee who killed his brother and a family. I understand why director wanted us to see Scar vs Bradley but come on it should've been Mustang vs Bradley because we do not see what  power Roy really has except pointing fingers in a direction to light a fire. I know I am being very harsh but it's true, a guy who wanted to become the president of Amestris face to face to a man who wants to destroy him  and secure his seat, but it's not my choice it was the writer's and I could be wrong but I'm just saying that I would've liked this version more since I was waiting something more exciting.
What I really didn't like about the show is the comedy sketch in a very serious moments, I always believed that  it kills the joy and it really does, that's why I could not watch this show for years!  I mean you can't punch a very badly injured guy on a head when he's lying in bed waiting a miracle to happen so that he survives, but they DO  beat them up just to make 12 years old laugh.For me what was really hard to digest was the fact that it was a very slow burner show, it has 64 episodes but it really burned very slow if we compare this anime to for example HxH(even though it was more than 150 episode) HxH was actually filled with a better comedy in a right place right time, not in a fight scenes, not in a sad emotional moments.What I mean is that you should have a little  funny segments but NOT EVERYWHERE! OR was the writer giving equivalent exchange in that way too? ""WELL I MADE YOU VERY SAD AND LETS MAKE YOU LAUGH AFTERWARDS TOO"" and that is why I had mixed feelings about the show. 
Once I finished the show I  immediately realized why  FMA-BROTHERHOOD held #1 on the list. I think people who watched FMA 2003 was not satisfied with the ending,so the way they remastered this was to have a better animation and a  happy ending the fans of old really wanted to see, so this anime for many fans was  just a sweet rehash of nostalgia and mainly had a purpose of making this show remembered. So as a new viewer I really think this anime should not be on the first place, I mean it's a good show but definitely I've seen better and more meaningful. No offense to fans, I liked the show but it's not THAT amazing everyone is fascinated about. Peace!",6
"
                The series was much better than the original anime and I would recommend it to anyone; all the characters were great, the artwork and music were amazing and it was just great all around. It started off like the original but after a while it was completely different which was good as I didn't want them to be similar, the story was a little confusing but it was clever and there were so many twists that made it such an addictive anime than I could not stop watching. The ending was a lot less emotional than the original full metal alchemist series but it was
                  still good in it's own right (and I preferred it anyway) 
Everything about this anime was amazing one of my favorites ever! just watch it, you won't be able to stop :')",10
"
                This was a very well thought out and paced series. The first couple episodes were pretty dark (I don't really dig that kinda stuff; I'm more into lighthearted things) so I actually stopped watching for a good while. Eventually I decided to continue on and man am I glad I did!
As the show progresses, more plot lines are appearing; it wasn't just about the boys getting their bodies back - it's a lot bigger than it seems.
I really enjoy the character developments throughout the entire anime. If there's anything I would want, it's to have more romance - but hey that's just me. Other than
                  that, I really thought it was great quality and time worth spending.
It's adventurous, fun, not too heavy, easy to follow and enjoyable. Totally recommend!!!",9
"
                Initially I have to make it clear a to few people out there that FMA Brotherhood is not the same/continuation of the series. It's a completely different story (putting aside character similarities and maybe the initial few episodes). Brotherhood is thoroughly adapted from the manga whereas the initial series diverted from the manga story line after a few episodes.
And to sum it up it is one of ""the"" best anime out there and is definitely a must watch for everybody who loves anime. But writing just that would not be doing justice to the series, so moving on...
I would say that the initial pacing was
                  a bit rushed, which seemed like they were trying to skip over the parts that were shown in FMA. This might have been looked upon as bad move but then it seems to be justifiable since they didn't want to send a message to the viewers that the series was exactly the same as before. The only drawback this had (the initial pacing) in my opinion was the lack of emotion and attachment to certain characters in the beginning, which was there in the first anime. The story's pace became normal from episode 10 or so and it managed to tell the story with little or no confusion at all.
The plot is one of the best I've seen in a very long time with cleverly built up twists and turns everywhere. It is one of those series you could say was planned from bottom to top and unlike a lot of other anime's out there, it tied all the loose threads perfectly giving you a wonderful wholesome picture of the story at the end.
The characters were portrayed very well and with appropriate depth so that by the end of the series you may feel attached to the people in it. Everyone had a rich story on their side and motives that drive them which meant that there are very few people you would come to dislike, unless the story demands it of course. There are also plenty of new characters that provide further depth to the series. The older characters like Mustang, Scar and Wrath are even more awesome and have been portrayed much more detailed than before.
The animation and voice acting are very well done and it does justice to the scenes portrayed. The art as a matter of fact is more detailed and portrays the characters in much better shade than earlier. Action scenes are brilliantly choreographed and most if all the Opening, Ending songs are awesome. The Background Music if any are used appropriately and is not overused at all (in the sense that, it is not used to give emotions to scenes when its just not there). 
Overall this is one anime tuned to perfection! And I repeat the fact that to sum it up its one of the best anime out there and everyone should definitely give it a go! 10/10",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of the few anime I feel I can recommend to anyone. It ropes you in right from the beginning with its great story and characters. Each character is memorable in their own way. I like how the world doesn't revolve around the Elric brothers, unlike most shonen. However, some characters established in the beginning are left out for the majority of the story and the way they all conveniently pop back up towards the end feels incredibly forced. Also, some of the villains are generic and aren't nearly as fleshed out. Especially the main antagonist, Father, whose personality feels identical
                  to any other shonen antagonist. Despite this, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an excellent anime and is a must-watch especially for shonen fans.",10

                ""There's no such thing as a painless lesson. They just don't exist. Sacrifices are necessary; you can't gain anything without losing something first. Although, if you can endure that pain, and walk away from it, you'll find that you now have a heart strong enough to overcome any obstacle. Yeah...a heart made Fullmetal.""
When FMA came on to the screen in 2003, anime fans went nuts over the likable characters, well-done humor, and overall engaging story-telling. However, some fans criticized the show for not being true to the source material. Personally, I was satisfied with how the show ended, and since then it became one of
                  my top 5 animes of all time. Fast forward to 2009, where we now have the release of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, an adaptation that is truer to the source material. Does Brotherhood make up for the faults of the original series? Yes...and No.
Technically speaking, Brotherhood truly is a visual marvel. Studio Bones is probably the best animation company in the anime industry. This is true with FMA (2003), Soul Eater, Wolf's Rain, OHSHC, and with Brotherhood as well. Colors are vivid, backgrounds are detailed, and overall art direction is superb. Definitely watch this show on a HDTV. Sound, however, falls a little flat for me. Granted, I think the OPs and EDs of Brotherhood are definitely a step up from the 2003 anime, but then there's the score to Brotherhood. It's certainly not a bad score, but it's not as memorable as the 2003 anime score. The 2003 anime score carried emotional weight whereas the Brotherhood score I feel doesn't leave that much of an impact. That's not to say it's bad, in fact, it's very good. However, a score is great when it gives me goosebumps, sets the tone for what's to come, and I don't feel that with the Brotherhood score. Voice acting is just awesome as you expect. Both Vic Mignogna and Romi Paku both return to Edward, a role that both of them are known the most for. In fact, most of the voices actors from the 2003 anime, both dub and sub have returned, but there are stand-ins for those who couldn't return. For example, Aaron Dismuke couldn't reprise his role of Alphonse due to puberty, however, his replacement Maxey Whithead does an amazing job in the role. Plus, Aaron does makes a cameo so watch out for that. Overall, voice work is excellent in both languages so personal preference what it will come down to.
FMA as a whole is just beautiful. As you watch the show you believe the these characters and their relationships with one another. You believe that these two Brothers want to get their bodies back. Edward, while very-short tempered, knows what his priority is and tries his best to be the best older brother a person could have. Alphonse, while in someway may be the weak one, is really the one who is stronger of the two becoming the voice of reason in situations. Then there are the side characters such as the serious yet cocky Col. Roy Mustang, and Winry, a girl that while on outside looks likes your shoe-in love interest, is really inside a tough strong female character. There are so many other characters I could tell you about like Scar and Riza Hawkeye, but if I told you then we would be here all day. Hell, FMA even has likable villains. There is no character I hate in FMA, not a single one. However, Brotherhood's narrative while great suffers from many flaws.
First of all, this could be just me, but compared the 2003 anime, which also had comedy, Brotherhood is very goofy. Meaning, throughout the series, there were a lot of moments of humor that just didn't fit right. It's not that I don't like the humor, but it's with this humor in Brotherhood that I feel that it is more of a straight up comedy. I do laugh when there is humor but for me it ruins the flow of certain scenes of intensity. I say if you want to do comedy then do it at a time where it is appropriate.
Comedy aside, Brotherhood's real problem comes from one simple fact: it's very cliched writing. Don't get me wrong, story-wise, I do find it superior to the original in that it resolves certain characters by the end. Although, the resolution is plagued by so many things we have seen before and many things you see coming. I won't spoil the ending for you, but the end is shall I say...silly. It's a totally justified ending and reasonable ending, but it's the actions of the main bad guy that really tick me off. It's not that he is bad at being a bad guy, but rather, he's the bad guy that we have all seen before. He doesn't do anything new nor bring anything special to the table. We know what he will do and we know how this is going to end. I know that I'm making this more of a comparison as opposed to an actual review, but once again, the 2003 ended in a way that made it felt unexpected. In Brotherhood, I knew what was coming. This doesn't make it necessarily bad writing, just semi-lazy writing. Then comes another flaw in the resolution, that while steps up the cliche writing, feels a little bit too complex for this show to begin with. Luckily, it's one of those head scratchers that even if you don't understand it, you can still just go with it.
I think Brotherhood while a excellent adaptation of the source material, still has some problems with it that prevent it from being 10 out of 10 material for me. However, I really enjoyed Brotherhood, nonetheless. While I do believe that the first anime is significantly better as a stand-alone, Brotherhood is still a very faithful adaptation. If anything, here's my order of how you should go about this: first, go watch the 2003 anime and movie, and then watch Brotherhood. Seriously, if you are an anime fan who hasn't gotten around to this franchise yet, then I highly recommend you check it out immediately.",9

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the more recent anime adaptation of the manga titled Fullmetal Alchemist, and it follows the events of the manga much more faithfully than the original anime.  It has a little bit of every, from a good plot, great characters, exciting AND humorous moments, which is why I think it is beloved so much.  Do I agree with the praise it gets?  Absolutely.
STORY:  10
The plot in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood kind of seems like it isn't going anywhere for the first few episodes, except for episode 2, which gives us the backstory of the two main characters, but after
                  a little while it starts picking up... and it DOESN'T STOP.  I'm serious.  This show keeps getting better and better and better as it progresses.  The pacing is stellar throughout, and some of the plot-twists are REALLY well placed.  Serious and humorous moments are placed carefully, so as not to interfere with each other.  There will still be the occasional joke in the middle of a battle, but they still work well, particularly the running gag of the main character being so short.  I don't want to spoil too much, but just know that no matter how much you like this show at any point during it, it will still manage to get better from there.
ART:  9
The animation during battles is excellent.  It's fluid and easy to understand what's happening.  The alchemy looks cool, especially for people who like flashy battle scenes, but it still manages to not get too overwhelming.  The art is great for the most part as well, but I feel like there were some scenes where there was too much contrast between colorful characters and dull backdrops.  Generally, I think a dull scene should represent a serious or sad moment, while colorful usually indicates upbeat and happy.  Both of these types of scenes are present in FMA:B, but there are a few cases where the art doesn't completely adjust to compensate for the mood of the scene.
SOUND:  8
I liked all of the opening theme songs in this anime.  Personally, from best to  worst (although not bad), my order would be 1,4,5,2,3.  This show is known for its openings (among many other things) and for good reason.
The ending theme songs were mostly forgettable to me.  I really liked the first one, and I thought the fourth one was decent, but the rest of them didn't really stand out.
The OST is very fitting, but there were not very many tracks that I would actually listen to on my own.  The main theme and ""Crime and Punishment"" are my personal favorites.
And what about voice acting?  As to be expected, the Japanese version is not bad, BUT... the English dub is PHENOMENAL.  It's the best I've ever scene.  Every single actor fit their role and was enthusiastic about it, and they definitely knew what they were doing.  I don't hate English dubs.  In fact, I usually prefer watching them unless they are absolutely unbearable, but FMA:B is the ONLY show where a majority of the fanbase will agree that the dub is good, even some of the people who refuse to think so about any other dub at all.  In fact, a considerable number of people agree that the dub is better than the original, me included!
CHARACTER:  10
This may be Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood's strongest suit.  EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER plays a MAJOR role in the story.  They are all developed and all get their own time in the spotlight at different times.  There are a LOT of characters but they are all memorable.  Anything from the main characters, to the soldiers, or the random side characters, to the freaking characters who show up in only a SINGLE episode.  They are all extremely well written, unique, and elaborated on and it is going to be REALLY hard for any anime to top FMA:B in the characters department.
ENJOYMENT:  10
I really loved this show.  It was exciting, emotional, and funny, all at different times.  It seriously had something to satisfy just about every anime fan (except people who only watch hentai).  I can recommend it to you wholeheartedly based on your interests... and I don't even know you!  That is pretty incredible.
OVERALL:  10
This show is going to be remembered as a true classic for years to come, and it very well should be. Although it is not my number one favorite, I can say that it is definitely one of the few anime that I can honestly say deserves the number one spot and MAL's list of Top TV Series.",10

                What can I say besides the fact that it is a masterpiece? 
Animation 10/10
There is nothing to complain about the animation, pretty smooth and pleasing to the eye, with no errors or horrendous CGI....like some other anime out there... 
Art style 10/10
Now art style is whether you like it or not. Based on the manga they did a pretty good job. Anyone who judges an anime based on the art style should seriously get some professional help. 
Voice Acting 10/10
This is one of the few anime that I've watched Dub. They've done a great job translating it and every VA has done an excellent job,
                  like Vic Mignogna who has done an incredible work with Edward. Furthermore, Troy Baker is voicing Greed (who is my favorite character), what else could you ask for?
Story 10/10
It may seem slow at the start but it gets better, especially since the first episode is a filler (which you will come to appreciate later on). The synopsis of the story is right there, read it, if you like it then watch. I definitely recommend you to do so.
Soundtrack 10/10
OPs are pretty lit, and the overall soundtrack is nice and fitting.
Enjoyment 10/10
Great experience. Had fun.
Characters 10/10
Every character feels unique and interesting (the excellent voice acting helps that even more) by far the best ones, in my opinion, are Greed and Lin. Their chemistry is simply amazing.
Overall 10/10
Note: If you're one of the people who waste their time by creating second accounts just so you can review bomb FMAB and give any other anime a 10 so it can get on top then please get a life. It's pretty pathetic.",10

STORY: 10
This is the best damn story in anime. Honestly. It was just that much spot on. The ending was so complete. I almost cried.
ART: 10
This anime looks so good! It's at the top.
SOUND: 10
Kono omoi wo keshite shimau ni wa, yes the opening featuring the AMAZING 'Yui - Again' is the BEST opening in ANIME. PERIOD. I could write an essay on just that one opening, but the rest were also great. So were the endings. To name a few, 'Chemistry - Period'
                  (Opening 4), 'Uso...' (Ending 1), 'Shunkan Sentimental' (Ending 4 - also one of my favourites)... I love the soundtrack.
CHARACTER: 10
The characters are clear to show their ambitions etc. and they are so interesting. This is why I 'almost' cried at the ending; because I felt so happy for the characters. They were well developed, and this sort of overlaps with the storytelling because, for example, the Homunculus' deaths, Hohenheim's past, all of that stuff was just spot on.
Enjoyment: 10
I remember watching around 20 episodes a day with this anime. I was really hooked to it, and being rather new to anime, 64 episodes was rather long but I had finished the series in a week. Another reason why I 'almost' cried at the ending - because it ended (a reason as to why I might watch the 2003 series). This is my favourite anime. 
Overall: 10 - OUTSTANDINGRU
THIS ANIME IS AMAZING. I LOVE IT. AS I HAD SAID, IT IS MY FAVOURITE ANIME. WATCH IT. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.",10

                10/10
Before Gintama, FMA was the first and only anime that fill me with lots of emotional, feels, laughs and tears.
Everyone who watches anime will at least know of FMA. The story.. is perfect. It's just fucking perfect!
The story starts almost normal but then it went up itself, the story is not just about the adventure of Ed and Al to retrieve their bodies back but is about finding out the truth behind what they're looking and how it connects to the people, the country and the fate of all, meeting new people that will help them and some old friends too, finding about their stories.
It
                  brings happiness, sadness, empathy, exitement, explosion throughout the entire anime.
The amount of great and outstanding characters is high, everyone is interesting and great villains that are despicable.
This is for me a flawed masterpiece. It was outstanding, i was never bored and kept watching.
Any one who hasn't watch this anime need to watch it right now, I mean it",10
"
                FMA: Brotherhood is consistently ranked as an all-time great anime, and it is well deserving of that respect. To note: I've never watched the 2003 anime and I have read only the first 2/3 or so of the manga (and enjoyed it).
The story is a fun, well-paced adventure with a good balance of action scenes, plot-driven scenes, and quieter emotional moments. The ability in the series, alchemy, has well defined limits and never feels overpowered. Early episodes covering some seemingly 'stand-alone' stories are not forgotten by the characters and influence them across the series. There are a few emotional gut-punches that you will remember long
                  after watching the show. The mysterious homunculi and the overarching plans of the villain/s are interesting to learn about.
The show covers the morality of war, propaganda, and revenge. It incorporates philosophical ideas in a compelling way, without ever condescending the viewer or becoming too abstract or confusing. It has plenty of goofy moments to balance the serious material, which prevents it from ever being pretentious. It has minimal fanservice. An example is the character of Mei Chang, who may seem at first glance to be a annoying moe trope, but this is far from the truth - she is smart, powerful, capable, and has her own dubious moral choices to make. The brother's stated goal of finding the philosopher's stone doesn't feel like a childish quest and the item in question is not some fix-all magical reward for defeating the bad guys.
The anime has an ample cast of well-developed characters. Our heroes, Ed and Al, and incredibly likeable and sympathetic. They are not written as typical perfect shounen heroes who always instinctively understand the best and wisest moral path; rather they are young boys who make mistakes, face the consequences, and must discover the truth of the world for themselves. They are both equally capable of being serious and being goofy, providing comic relief as well as an emotional core to the story. Their sweet, fierce, and wholesome brotherly bond is a joy to watch, and illustrates why 'Brotherhood' is such a fitting subtitle for this anime.
The cast is well-rounded with characters who have their own goals, ambitions, and philosophies, quite apart from our central Elric brothers. The show avoids the shounen trope of having a great deal of characters whose only goals are seemingly to help the protagonists achieve THEIR goal. Ultimately, though there is a common enemy that many of our cast must come together to face towards the end, once this is resolved the brothers still must stand alone, and find their answers alone.
Brotherhood boasts a solid OST. There are many recognisable themes and beautiful pieces throughout. A personal favourite is the eerie, foreboding sound that plays during many early encounters with the Homunculi. I think the only thing missing is the track 'Brothers' which featured in the 2003 show; I haven't even watched that, it's just a beautiful piece! But I digress. The opening themes are consistently good and suitable for a shounen show; my favourite is 'Period'. The ending themes are more mellow and also memorable.
To note, I've often watched the English dub; I enjoy the energy of the voice actors, and a particular favourite is Al's VA, who I think adds to the sweet and endearing nature of Al's character. What I've seen of the Japanese audio is also very good and not significantly different in tone or quality, so I think either would be equally enjoyable.
The artwork is consistently high quality. The characters are drawn in a more realistic style, without distractingly exaggerated features like over-the-top anime eyes...the action scenes are visually exciting, the lines are clean, the backgrounds are pleasant. The series incorporates plenty of goofy moments and the simplified drawings of characters work really well to complement this; Al is my favourite example of this when he is a drawn as a big, adorable grey sausage. Also, the exaggerated way that Armstrong and Sig Curtis are drawn when showcasing their muscles is always hilarious to me!
I think the series rates so consistently high among viewers, and in my own mind, because of it's two greatest strengths:
1. It's just the right length. It's not rushed; we have plenty of time to enjoy and become attached to the characters. And it's not overblown - it has basically no filler at all, and doesn't follow the path of many long-running shounen series.
2. More than any other anime I've seen, Brotherhood absolutely nails the ending. I mean REALLY nails it. Even the best shows can flounder when trying to tie everything up neatly at the end, but Brotherhood is a masterclass. Rest assured that if you choose to start this show, you can expect a satisfying payoff at the end.
It's easy to see why this is a frequent recommendation as a gateway into anime; it's ambiguous setting doesn't polarise anyone, and it incorporates something for everyone: smart storytelling, fantastical battle scenes, monstrous characters, lighthearted glimpses of life, political intrigue, ambiguous morality, and hints of romance that don't feel forced. I think this anime can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of what genre you may typically prefer.
Overall, I promise I have not been lazy by scoring it so highly in every category! Examining each element carefully has convinced me that deducting points for the sake of being hyper-critical is simply unjustified. It's just so hard to find fault with this anime. It deserves it's spot as one of the most acclaimed anime of all time, and is one that I personally love and thoroughly enjoy rewatching.",10
"
                Maybe I'm not a fan of the military genre, but really this story is not so good that Number 1, simply two brothers go to retrieve their lost souls and revive their mother, then quite a few characters appear. The story progressed to the end, but I wasn't impressed with any of the characters. There's never been an episode that brought me to tears (there may be one but that's it). There are even episodes that make me just want it to go by quickly. However, I was impressed by the opening songs and ending songs, the songs were too good. When the story ended,
                  the next day, I didn't even remember what happened.",6

                I’m going to keep this nice and short.

I personally thought it was bland, maybe most who watched FMB are first time watchers of anime, maybe I’ve been spoiled with other greats such as code geass, hxh, etc I legit give this show a 6/10 f*ck it.

                I LOVE this anime. I've watched the 2003 version and found it lackluster but FMA:Brotherhood fills the void in my heart. It has a great story that keeps you on your toes,funny scenes,AMAZING SOUNDTRACK,great character development and it's clearly one of the best animes of all time. It's a must watch for any anime fan as this is a protagonist done right. He grows and he sacrifices a lot for his friends. The antagonists are great except for Father,he's quite boring after all the hype around him but the other homunculus are great especially Envy. This is one of my favourite animes and anyone reading

                I have watched every adaptation of the Fullmetal Alchemist series, from the original, the specials, to the movies. Brotherhood by far is the best adaptation. The characters are full of life and relatable, and grow throughout the story. There are small details you don't notice until you rewatch it. The story is outstanding and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The ost fits the scenes perfectly, and the opening and ending songs really show how the characters feel. 
Studio Bones did a fantastic job at animating Brotherhood, especially the fight scenes. This is my highest rated anime and it deserves the Number 1
                  spot. It also has a stellar dub, and I have watched over 90% of my anime subbed. Great voice actors like Vic Mignogna, Todd Haberkorn, and Caitlin Glass do their jobs splendidly.
Overall a big 100/10 every anime fan should defiently watch this masterpiece.",10

                This is my first anime review (better late than never as they say). 
I watched the first series and i thought that it was good, but i felt unsatisfied, until i saw this and i must say it is a masterpiece because the story has more depth along with sending important messages for instance, if people what to achieve something in life, they would have make sacrifices and another lesson is about those who think they are above others will pay for their arrogance and afterwards, they would learn a lesson in humility.  The voice acting is brilliant, one of the best dubs i
                  have watched, the animation is fluid, the character designs are superb. I really enjoyed this anime, especially on how this anime tackles issues on civil wars, racism, religion, hubris. 
For those who are new to anime, please watch this i highly recommend this!!",10
"
                I'm a bit disappointed with this show. After seeing so much people praising it, I watched it and found too many issues for it to be considered one of the best animes I ever watched.
The anime starts with an overall superb quality in all the areas. Then I think it's impossible for an attentive viewer not to notice that from the middle of the series onwards the overall quality decays a lot. And that applies for almost everything, from the animation to the plot, any exception I would make here is for the soundtrack, which is amazing.
The animation is great at the beginning, with fights
                  showing all movements and blows in detail, with the camera shaking and you getting the feeling of action in the air. Towards the end of the series, however, some fights go as low as to show some alternate static frames of one character's blow represented by a flashy line drawn across the frame, and the other character falling to the ground and his face punched: a feature worth of the animes made back in 1990.
That decay in quality is what disappoints me the most. The plot also starts very emotional and engaging, with very legitimate and moral questions being approached. The character's motives and emotions are explored in depth, even though a large cast is presented, with new characters being introduced each two new episodes (more or less). 
However, after a while some mess is done with the characters and the plot as well. A character as distinct and badass as Kimblee - which you thought was supposed to give a hard time to everyone, which they spend a lot of time developing, going as far as to show flashbacks of the Ishvalan war and the connections between him and the other characters (like Roy Mustang and Riza Hawkeye) - simply disappears for a lot of time with no explanation and once he comes back he is given an end as quick and meaningless as his re-appearance.
Then lackluster characters such as Zampano, Darius, Heinkel and Jerso make it through the end without a good development. It's even annoying to see how they engage in the fights and everything else while lacking a motive to do so, whereas you also don't know a lot about them and they also lack personality.
And there's so much I could go on with. The melodramatic scenes, the long, dull and annoying humanist discourses every 2 to 3 minutes - all of this happens when the end of the show is nearing - is just obnoxious and gives the feel that the person who wrote the first 30 episodes is hardly the same who wrote the last 34.
All of this, in addition to the end, which honestly is an attempt to make every single character have a happy way to make it to the end of the story (meaning they didn't only had to make it through, it was also required that they'd be HAPPY as the show ends) sacrifices A LOT of the show's quality. So don't be fooled. It is a good anime, but all these reviews on the internet rating it 9.5/10/ Best Anime Ever are quite unrealistic and I go as far as to say that if it wasn't for the way I was clung to the characters during the shoe's verybbeginning, I'd hardly watch it all the way through the end.",7

                Is Fullmetal Alchemist the greatest shounen of all time? It's debatable whether or not it is. Yu Yu Hakusho fans will argue that theirs is the best, Hajime no Ippo fans may say theirs will be immortalized, and Naruto fans can affirm their belief in their show (Naruto is mid). However, I think something that people criminally undersell Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood on, is the fact that this show with sub 70 episodes managed to create a world so captivating that it could do in 70 episodes what 99% of shonen failed to do in 300. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood may not be the best shonen for
                  everyone. After all, taste and preference is subjective. But something that no one can truly argue is that FMA:B is excellent, if not perfect in all areas of a show. Honestly, I thought the story, while amazing, was the weakest parts of FMA:B. The original series felt more solid in this category, and FMA:B tended to feel a bit rushed or dragged out for certain parts of the series. Of course, this was only for a few episodes, so it was rarely truly felt. Downsides aside, FMA:B's story is captivating like none other, mostly because of the characters. Nearly every important character is likeable and appealing, and the villains tend to die in a sympathetic manner (as is usual with the shonen genre). You feel a sense of danger and worry for your favorite characters, as FMA:B quickly establishes itself as a show that's not afraid to sacrifice characters that it needs to, however is also aware of the line between tasteful use and shock value. This creates a tense atmosphere without being overbearing, and side characters aren't just there to die. Of course, the downtime is great too. FMA:B has consistently hilarious parts, and the way that characters interact gives you a lot of insight into their relationship, as well as their personality. It goes without saying that the art and animation are amazing, as I believe that Studio Bones did both FMA and FMA:B. The ending of FMA:B is also something that propels this show to the top of the shonen genre. It's conclusion was perfect: satisfying, in-depth, but also knows when its welcome is overdue. Shonen that continue on past their intended endings tend to feel out of place, and I appreciate FMA:B for knowing when to stop and how to create such an incredible ending. Overall, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one of the only shows that I think truly deserves a 10/10.",10

"
                I have to admit, when first starting out this series, I didn't really understand the appeal. I first got recommended this anime by a friend and said that this was his favorite anime of all time. So, I decided to watch it and wow.
Furthermore, all I have to say is that even though from the outset I had my doubts, I'm glad that they were disproven. This is definitely a ride and I do have to say that this turned out to be one of the best anime's I have ever seen. The way that it builds up and the underlying messages of love, acceptance,
                  and sacrifice are amazing and it makes it much more enjoyable.
Lastly, This definitely should be a 'Must-Watch' for people that are new to anime and I know you'll love it.",10

                FMA: Brotherhood 8/10
I've watched this anime more than 10 times bro ... It's not my favorite, but it's my top 30 ...
When I watched FMA Brotherhood for the first time, around 2012 ... I was amazed at how the author managed to get to such a climax so fast with such competence, right in the first 5 episodes ... It's not that kind of anime that you you have to watch a hundred episodes to start looking cool, from the first he’s already very good, but from 3 to 5 he shows why the best anime on MyAnimeList is ranked! It is the second version,
                  where it follows the manga faithfully, different from the first version. I watched the first version ... The first version, many hated it, because from a certain point in history, it started to be filler, they completely changes the course of the original story. since they had no material to adapt, because the manga was still being released at the time (of course there are fanatics who love the first version and speak badly about Brotherhood, but that is beside the point).  In addition, as the designer has changed, the line is much more beautiful. Another point I love is the openings, the five are sensational ... none disappoint or make you skip them, they are so good. FMA Brotherhood is not a sequel, it is a remake... 
whether it is worth watching? Of course it is worth it .... If it is not your favorite anime, it will certainly be your top 5. For those afraid of the work, give it a try, you will not regret it.",8
"
                This anime was well liked for multiple reasons. The music is fantastic, it actually makes you watch the openings and endings. The story is very unique and is something that you can't copy. Each character has a purpose and they connect to real people in our generation. It's also very funny. Most people like this more than the original because it relates more to the manga version, and the music is better. I can't really say anything bad about this anime, it really gives you time to think about yourself. Very few animes do that.

                The perfect  anime or the perfect things don´t exit but for full metal will be an unexpected exception. 
An epic and untold legend will be for me Full Metal Alchemist and all of his mening.
I was very reluctant about this anime because i was very blind, but this summer when i had nothing to do i decided to watch Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood and when i fnished it my expectations were more than overcome.
My favorite anime and the reason that i became a really otaku was for Naruto but  when i finish watching this anime I realized that a new anime was my
                  favorite and was the best for me by far.
If you are searching for and incredible history, for amazing characters and for great battles and always a couples of lovers this will be your best option, and won´t leave you indifferent because you will see all the chapters that you could in an evening even there will be evening tha you won´t go out with your friends, because the way that the plot is explain in Full Metal Alchemist is fabolous, i think the best in an anime, the characters are amazing and with a great personallity and the ending is simply magic.
So this is it all tha you´re looking in an anime is beyond the magic of Full Metal Alchemist and is difficult to find an other manga/anime that can overtake it, only the future will tell us.",10
"
                The first difference I saw from the last one was the depth of characters.  Every character had depth including main and small characters.  There was even depth in the homunculus.
I was glad to find that the anime was definitely different from the last one in terms of the story.  The story of Winry turned out better, which I'm glad it did. 
Overall, I didn't like how the story gave up on the brothers bringing back the mother.  It went to the brothers bringing back their bodies too quickly.
Anyways, the meaning of the entire story was worth something.  That was the
                  problem with the last one.  I enjoyed the ""training"" and ""trying out"" for the alchemist from the last show, but it also worked leaving a lot of it out from this version.  
I liked the relationship between the brothers and the mega bad guy.  There was the enemy you couldn't figure out who looked like your father and they handled the relationship in a very unknowing, mysterious way. 
The writing made the quickness of events well absorbent.  You could understand what was happening even though lots of information was passing through.  Kind of like when Ed was getting the truth forced into his mind.
Very enjoyable show to watch, even for its length.  I watched 40 episodes in a day, sounds pretty enjoyable to me.",10
"
                A summary for this anime is ""consequence"" or equivalent exchange.The anime tells the story the Elric brother's,who lost their mother and stand alone in world,through alchemy,then try bring your mother back to life but,everything was in vain.After the all,Edward Elric decided join in the Armestris army and become a federal alchemist.
All characters is very,very captivanting ,from the secundary to villians,all characters has their a goal and not is boring,everyone has a goal and its makes sence.
Lastily,Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood it's a great anime to the 2nd generation and surth worth watching.
Uno resumo para este anime es ""consecuencia"" o ""intercambio equivalente.El anime conta la historia de los
                  hermanos Elrich,quien perdió a su madre y están solos en el mundo,por la alquimia,tratan de llevar su madre a la vida,pero todo fue en vano.Entoces de todo,Edward Elric decide alistarse en el ejército de el Amestris y convertise en un alquimista federal.
Todas las personas son muy muy cativantes,desde la secundaria hasta los villones,todos tiene uno objetivo y no son aburridas,todos objevito tienen sentido.
Para concluir,Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood es un excelente anime de la segunda geriación y vale la pena ver",9
"
                The ONLY reason I haven't given this anime a perfect 10 on all counts is that I owe it to Rurouni Kenshin to stay at my untouchable, indelible pinnacle spot of all time. Other than that there is absolutely no reason not to categorize this as one of the most modern masterpieces I have laid eyes upon.
As a remake of the original TV series (although this was the original manga series) this anime completely destroys the image of the initial series FMA (although that was damn good too) and makes you burn all 64 episodes into your memory (pun with Mustang's flame alchemy here ;)
                  ) 
The most amazing character of Japanese animation, Roy Mustang appears here, with the most devastating series of villains I have ever seen after Kenshin. The entire storyline is so beautifully molded with elements of ancient ideals and state-of-the-art technology that its not only a visual treat, but delectable to the gray cells too. Character development is awesome and so is power level maintenance (what I mean by this is that each character gradually grows stronger or weaker, not suddenly and no one hogs power level e.g. Vegeta and Goku in DBZ.. everyone is similarly powerful and even non-alchemists are effective in most situations)
The storyline is one of the best and most innovative and reminds me of Haruki Murakami's writing in its fluidity and abstractness.. but none of the knots are tied in an illogical manner - everything has a clear basis (well except for maybe where the villain becomes God.. i didnt like that concept very much). Very original storyline.. really loved it as it unraveled slowly. Villains actually die here permanently instead of continuously haunting us after near death situations coming back ever stronger e.g CELL!!! (who else?? Buu too) Even though the villains are almost immortal, they've done a good job of actually bringing out each one's individual sin as a sign of mortality..loved it.
For guys/girls just about to set off on this grand 64 eps adventure I'm very jealous since I dont have time to re-watch this just now although I'd love to. Enjoy!! Definitely the best anime of the second half of this decade along with Shippuuden.",10

                Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood aka Hagaren is a MASTERPIECE. 
I’m not saying that FMA: Brotherhood is a ‘Perfect’ anime but I haven’t seen any which would be at par to the great experience this anime has given me. I’m not a fan of science, military or shounen but Hagaren perfectly mixed these genre to suit my liking. I love how there is fantasy in military, drama in action, science in history and comedy in a tragedy. 
The darkness and brightness of the story is balanced. One thing that made me really love this anime is that, there are no fillers at all. Each side stories
                  are deeply connected to the main plot. The 64-long series was never boring. I got so hooked I can’t even wait for the next episode to come out. 
The two main protagonists, Edward and Alphonse, are likeable. I hated Edward at first because of what happens to their bodies but as the story progress, I ended up cheering for the brothers. There are many characters in Hagaren but all of them has a significant role. Everyone help the protagonists discover the secret of alchemy. 
I love the animation. I’m not really picky with art but Bones did Hagaren so there’s nothing more to say. The voice actors/actresses did their part really well. Each voice match perfectly with the characters’ personalities. The expression and feelings are well delivered. The soundtrack is also great with YUI, SCANDAL and Shouko Nakagawa songs in it. I like how they change the OP and ED theme to match with the current ‘chapter’ of the series. Everything goes well together and it gets you really in the mood. 
I definitely enjoyed Hagaren. The excitement, the tears, the thrill and suspense, the mystery and tragedy will forever be missed. Though I felt that the 24-minute episodes are kinda short, each episode still has the depth I’m looking for in an anime episode. I enjoy the roller coaster feel from episode 1 to episode 64. This anime is worth the watch and re-watch. I don’t remember how many times I watched this but even so, I never got bored and the same feelings resurfaces everytime I re-watch this. 
Overall, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood or Hagaren will still hold the TOP spot in my list. It may have some flaws but truth is, no anime has ever get to the same level of Hagaren.",9
"
                Best shounen of all time so far for me. Superb story and its progression is great. Brilliant OSTs. The world of FMA Brotherhood is great and incredibly unique. The animation is great at its time. Every twist and turn is very logical and acceptable. The way the mind games between various characters are on point and great. The way the characters are incorporated in the story is brilliant. All characters if not most are given ample space to show their worth and mettle.The Op and Ed soundtracks are good and listenable.The villain is great and his character building is also very well done. The tone
                  and the setting is one another level.The way the anime ended was great and insanely fullfilling and wholesome.",10

                ATTENTION: This is a review directed at people who have already finished watching this anime. Therefore, it will frequently reference elements of the story readers are expected to be familiar with. That means spoilers.
At long last, I'm taking the time to elaborate on why I hate this anime so much.
Needless to say, I started to watch it with very high expectations. FMA:B has been the indisputable king in the anime community for most of the time it's been around and almost everyone you ask (and probably most people you don't ask) will regard this anime very highly. I believe the only exceptions are people who
                  like to hate on popular stuff, people who liked the '03 version too much, and people to whom it failed to live up to the expectations (like myself). Of course, having this amount of hype can only be detrimental to one's more skeptical experience. I believe the only massively popular anime that I've watched and that I liked more than what I expected was Re:Zero season 1 (might have been because most of what people talk about this season is ~that~ scene everyone hates). Surprisingly enough, I absolutely loved FMA:B when I started watching it and it had me absolutely hooked for the first couple of seasons. Well, if that's not the problem, what is it, then?
As I've said, I hate this anime because it failed to live up to my expectations, but I also said it's very good and that I loved its first seasons. While you probably correctly assumed I'm crazy, the answer lies in where the failed expectations were built, and by now you've realized my problem is in the fluctuating quality of the show. More specifically, this is the tragedy of an anime that builds up an amazing story but midway through it it has exhausted most of its quality fuel and it's simply out of steam to make the story keep up with what it set up in the earlier stages. For simplicity's sake, I'll say the quality drop happens between seasons 3 and 4, but keep in mind the quality drop is not discrete and the last two seasons also have great things about them (this is a great show, after all).
The end of the third season is more or less aligned with the big reveal about the anime. Who is the big bad and what's his plan. Of course, details are yet to be unfold, but we have a general idea. At this point of the story, the enemy has almost complete control over our heroes and we are aware of what's the end point of our journey. What's the next step? That's right. Nothing. Two whole seasons of comparatively very little narrative development. 
During the first three seasons, every step we took was either to step up the game so we feel more threatened or to reveal more about the story so we get more curious. Even though the show starts in a very intense episode, it ends on a ""the threat was taken care of"" note and we go back to the start. A start we know it's rough and very mysterious, but that's the fun, right? We taste it bit by bit so we can savor it, almost like when we swim in cold water, but we have to enter it slowly so we don't feel like freezing. But maybe you like that freezing sensation, so you hasten your step. 
Every few episodes we discover something new. A new threat, a new piece of information. We get ourselves wet with story on a steady pace. And it's great. Liore, Nina, Scar, the fifth lab, Al's soul, Hughes' death, Lust's attack, the people from Xing, Bradley's attack, Izumi's relationship with the boys, Ling and Ed getting swallowed by Gluttony. Even though we don't really lose many people, we're always closing further and further on the realization of it. And then it happens. We learn the truth about the Ishvalan War and the foundation of Amestris as well as the existence of Father, and then Bradley explicitly takes everyone as a hostage without making a single move soon after that. We've reached the peak. We had a buildup momentum in the story and we've crashed into a wall. Nothing can happen in the story that can continue the trend of getting us more and more excited. And, although it is not 100% discrete, like I said, much like a physical wall we feel the impact of stopping.
Winry is in danger? Don't care. Fort Briggs was taken over by Bradley's agents? Don't care. Selim is actually Pride? Don't care. Buccaneer and Fuu died? Don't care. Riza had her neck sliced? Don't care. Al undid his soulbind without knowing if there was a way back? Don't care. At this point, as long as we don't see a character that's dear for us die, it's not as bad as what we have already seen, so what's the big deal? The show keeps threatening us for two seasons straight, and we just wait. And wait. And wait. And it never happens. And every attempt of the show at making us anxious about losing someone just makes everything even more painful, kind of like when Envy was trying to make everyone attack each other but it fails so miserably everyone just pities ""him"" (?), characters and audience alike.
(Okay, Hohenheim died, but he was already hundreds of years old and he was only alive because of the very thing we were fighting against, so even though he is one of the best things about the later seasons we embrace his death like a natural thing. Sad, but inevitable.)
As expected, the characters I dislike the most are Kimblee and Pride, who get into action after the wall crash. They were set up to be these super dangerous end-game villains, but they don't even come close to cause the same damage the first villains did. The first three homonculi felt very much like forces of nature, who were only taken out by an  alchemist who possessed a forbidden knowledge about an extremely powerful and dangerous alchemy technique (one of these almost killed him in the process) or by another homunculus. Yes, Pride, the homunculus who is a literal extension of every shadow in Amestris, doesn't feel as disastrous to our characters as a busty woman who can extend her fingernails (I'm not talking about Meg but I guess she fits the description, too). Even Bradley, who at the end only killed a bunch of unnamed Briggs soldiers, Buccaneer, and Fuu, at least felt actually threatening until the boys went up north. 
Speaking of which, season 4 sends the boys to Fort Briggs (I just mentioned that twice without need but anyways), which, although it gives us some nice change of pace and some interesting characters (no, not Olivier), it's also very illustrative of the narrative crash. Things are terrible and they show no sign of getting worse. It isn't bad enough that the main villains of this season and the following fail to live up to the trend of the show and the expectation they've set for themselves, but now we have a whole division of soldiers established by the show as infallible, incorruptible and independent from its leaders, and soon after we get to know them they are aligned with our heroes' ultimate goals and they will help them fight the big bad when the time comes. But wait, Father has plans to spill a ton of blood on the soil around Fort Briggs. What kind of disaster needs to happen to manage to strike such a blow on our perfect boys while maintaining their core traits, which are fundamental to the story? They take the most obviously untrustworthy character of all and he convinces the enemy nation to initiate a sudden assault on the most well fortified section of the amestrian border. And it works, leading to hundreds of drachman soldiers dying by their own stupidity. The show has dug itself so deeply into not wanting to bring tragedy upon our dear characters that the solution that works best in this situation is the most nonsensical one. That's by far the most infuriating scene of all the 64 episodes to me.
So there we have it. A first part that builds more expectations than it can fulfill, plot constraints created by not thinking the whole thing through before writing (or simply just bad ideas) and some direct plot holes that are too specific for me to get into. Surely it can't get any worse for an anime that's rated 9/10 by a guy who spend a few hours of time he should've dedicated into writing his college thesis which is due in a week by utterly bashing the anime in the longest text he's ever written. Oh, no. It definitely can; but that doesn't affect the rating, since it's not the anime's fault. Yeah, with the hint I gave you at the start of this text, you guessed it: there's still the cult around it.
More specifically, the combination of all the aforementioned bad things with this anime's popularity is by far the most hateful thing about it. As it is with anything that's just too popular, especially with certain kinds of audiences, there is a cult built around this series, and I'm not simply talking about a cult in the sense of having a faithful fanbase or too many references in popular culture. You see, FMA:B is the type of anime whose popularity and unpopularity are strongly tied to a single feedback loop. Too many people praising it causes a lot of people to start praising it too because otherwise they're not ""true otakus"" and some other people to start trashing it because they don't want to get mixed up with those ""filthy weebs"". Likewise, people trashing it causes more people to trash it because disliking popular things makes you cool and might get you laid (according to the internet) but it also causes people to praise it because only trolls can hate this anime. On the other hand, being the #1 for many years, getting surpassed a few times only to get back to the top right away, in a site that's famous for the bad opinions of its users can only spell doom for the credibility of its popularity; although I was really surprised to see that only 1 of the 4 most popular reviews on MAL for FMA:B rated it 10/10. I suppose I underestimated the popularity of hating popular things. Silly me.
Still, that doesn't change the fact that the force behind the popularity of this anime is no joke. As the feedback loop gets stronger and stronger, so do people's opinions on it, and God forbid you don't think FMA:B is perfect and the best anime that has ever existed and that ever will. Of course, as with many things in life, the healthiest solution for this problem is simply staying neutral and avoiding conflict, but failing to withstand discipline will prove to be a huge mistake. In my case, I have spent much more energy caring about this thing than I like to admit, but I suppose it's much more infuriating when something makes you care about it, even a little bit, and then fails to live up to the expectations it created for you than something that is straight up bad.",9
"
                After this show being on hold for 2 years or so I finally found the motivation to struggle through this show and I have to say it was worth it. Well, it was still a bit overhyped since I do not believe it deserves number 1 spot. I can totally understand why this show is very popular, but not gonna lie, the first 15 episodes or so are not that good. It gets so much better somewhere around episode 30. There is a previous adaptation of this from 2003 but it is not that good and it has quite a bit of filler and it
                  changes things here and there. 
Story: These two brothers named Edward and Alphonse Elric lived happily until the day their mother had died. These boys learned alchemy and they tried to resurrect their dead mother, but since human transmutation is taboo and probably not possible, they both made great sacrifices, Edward lost his arm and leg while Alphonse lost his entire body. Now that they have seen the ""truth"" they can do alchemy without a transmutation circle. Now they start their quest to get their original bodies back. Along their journey they do many things such as make new friends, lose important people, help people, destroy a false god and many more great things. An important part of the story are Homonculi which are artificial humans which are made from philosopher's stone which is made by sacrificing multiple human beings. Along their journey they meet all the 7 deadly sins who are homonculi. All of them have their own unique design and power.
Characters: The cast is very unique I would say. Our main hero Edward is a state alchemist called Fullmetal Alchemist. He is heroic, stubborn and he gets angered quite easily. Due to his height of 148 centimeters he is called little by many people and that ticks him off. Alphonse is Edwrads younger brother. Due to his height and his metallic body, people call him the Fullmetal Alchemist. He is more calm and he is stronger than his older brother. Winry Rockbell is Edwards and Alphonses childhood friend and an automail engineer. Automails are metal prostetics. She cares deeply about the elric brothers but can act quite stubbornly about stuff. Von Hohenheim is the Elric Brothers dad. He is a living philosopher's stone. He is probably my favourite character in the series. He is calm, smart and epic as heck.
Roy Mustang is the flame alchemist. He is probably the deadliest alchemist towards humans and homoculi since he can burn all of them to dust. When he is angry he is one scary mofo, mostly he is calm goofball. There are more great characters to write about but I am too lazy. The supporting cast in this show is amazing. So many great characters.
OST: There are many good tracks here and there. For openings most of them are good. Only the second one kinda sucked in my opinion. My favourite was probably number 4.
This show is a good place to start when watching anime. SO this is a good gateaway anime. If there is something I mildly dislike is the comedy. Don't get me wrong there is some hilarious moments here and there. But at least in the start is was not that funny. The I guess forced chibification of the characters got real annoying at one point but it kinda stopped somewhere in the middle.
If you like shounen anime or just good story and animation I recommend this anime. TBH I think this is one of them must watch anime.",10
"
                Ahhh Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. If you want the short and sweet version of this, this is the very best shonen anime that I have ever seen in my life. I remember almost a year ago watching the first episode and being confused as heck to watching the last episode cradling my tissue box. This anime has one of the best stories ever told both in anime, and out of any story. The fantastic ride of Edward and Alphonse Elric is one of the most beautiful, thrilling, and amazing stories in anime. If you haven't watched it yet, you owe it to yourself to try this
                  one out, you won't be disappointed.",10
"
                (Edit: I recently re-watched FMAB and I found it even more enjoyable and was able to have a far better time appreciating what was happening and how the story unfolds, so I am changing my review from a 9 to a 10)
After hearing all the hype I was excited to see what FMA was all about.  I wound up being a little disappointed in the first half of the series though. But overall I really enjoyed this anime and it is definitely worth a watch!
As I said earlier: I found the first half of the series kind of dull.  Firstly I wasn't drawn
                  into any of the characters very deeply-- I found Ed pretty annoying, Al one sided, Hughes ... well Hughes, Ling random, etc.  I thought the art and score were good but I didn't find them enthralling or anything.  I found myself only paying half-attention. And the only purely negative opinion I have on FMA is how they try to make Winry a fanservice character.
But then...
Episode 40 hit me hard!  Everything that happened after that redeemed any problems that bothered me in the prior episodes.  At this point I found that everything that happened had gravity and meaning.  The characters saw real change and I developed a love for many of them and became interested in the stories of all of them.  And that is what won me over in FMA.  Despite a slightly disappointing final boss, the ending of the show is perfect.  I found closure with every character and have no need to see what happens to them in the future outside of my own imagination.",10
"
                Makes you hate the fact that you already finished watching it at the end.
Every single character were lovable in their own ways and through them we are taught that everything that happens is a necessity.
Music was beautiful in every aspect, suits the mood of each scene and is immensely effective.
The characters were full of life with excellent voice acting, personalities and roles that fulfilled the overall storyline marvelously.
I can point out many weaknesses, but I see no point in doing so as it has already delivered its purpose in such a convincing way that it drowns them out.
A series that touches upon meaning with wonder
                  in life.",10
"
                i could write essays and essays about how much i love this show and it wouldn't be enough for me to express everything i want to say. this show is so rich and full and imaginative and action-packed and touching and thought-provoking and i adored every second of watching it. i couldn't even think of watching anything else during the month-long period i spent watching this.
the plot was smart and compelling. the animation was sharp and, especially during the fight scenes, it was amazing how fluid it was. the music was effective at creating atmosphere, and the opening themes were great (#4 was my absolute
                  favourite, i never skipped it! i didn't listen to the ending themes as much oops). the world of amestris is so well-conceived and every location had a part to play in furthering the story. the concept of alchemy in all its various forms is endlessly fascinating to me. the intrigue and drama and action interspersed with comedy kept me totally hooked.
but for me, the real alchemy of the show, its true magic, lies in its huge breadth and depth of characters, who are all so well-realised and distinct in their design and characterisations. they are what keep you captivated in the story and keep you invested in following it through to its conclusion.
ed and al as the leading duo have such a powerful and genuine bond, and they grow and learn so much from each other as the show progresses. amidst all the breathtaking action and suspense, the heart of the show always remains firmly fixed on the brothers and their relationship, and that is what proves to be the most powerful force in the story.
the supporting cast is fantastic as well, from roy mustang (my main man, what a Good Guy, loyal and intelligent and so insanely powerful) and riza hawkeye (roy's moral centre, the best girl), olivier armstrong (who quickly became a firm favourite of mine due to her no-nonsense attitude and commanding personality), and ling yao (his back-and-forth with greed was something i loved watching).
and the homunculi. WOW the homunculi. what brilliantly unique antagonists, and what a challenge they present to the characters throughout the show. my personal favourites were greed and envy, and i liked lust too (even though she didn't have as huge a part to play in this story). and for many, in their last moments, they showed so much more depth than you would expect from just mere villains.
if i had one criticism to make of this show (if it can even be called a criticism), it's that i want more. there were some moments that i wish had played out a little slower just so i could understand what was happening (particularly near the end), and i would have loved deeper exploration of some of the characters such as father and hohenheim. and more importantly, i want more of these characters, i want more of this world, i want to know everything there is to know about everything. i became attached to this show (and its 2003 counterpart) very quickly and what we have just isn't enough for me.
i think it is pretty remarkable that, for a sci-fi/fantasy/action/battle genre show, there are some powerful questions that are brought up about what it means to be human, how far you would go to get what you want, what is the value of human life.
and i think it is pretty remarkable that, after everything, once all the dust clears, the moral of this larger-than-life story is something so achingly human and simple: that the most important thing in life is to love and to be loved in return.

                The Ishvals were just jews and the militaries were nazis. That should be the main focus of the story and not the story about two kids who try so desperately to regain their bodies or to unmask a massive conspiration. 
The Holocaust happened, the Tiananmen massacre happened, the japanese war crimes happened and the Ishval genocide also happened. RIP my niggas who tried to use alchemy like Minecraft, gone but not forgotten. 
And now to make this review longer I will tell you why this anime is kind of communist.
It's impossible to not think ""equal exchange"" doesn't mean communism. Laws of alchemy/chemistry my ass, you
                  just want equal wage for everyone. You didn't have to bring politics into this.",10

                One of the best TV series ever made, it deserves the high praises it gets everywhere. I pushed it away way too often thinking it would be overrated but boy was I wrong, it really exceeded my expectations. Truly a Masterpiece.
The storyline is the best, the pacing, the storylines, world-building... everything. It progresses as the episodes go on, it not only focuses on our protagonists Ed and Al but also a number of characters and gives it's respect to the characters. The plot is very clever and has many twists and turns to surprise us. There are many characters and all provide an impact on
                  the main story, the secondary antagonist is strong enough to lead the show on their own and that is what I love about this show. The show has its comedic relief very often even though it deals with a pretty dark storyline. Easily got one of the best endings of all time.
The voice actors were stupendous and were of consistent quality, the directing was the best, the animation was epic, opening and ending music was beautiful and spot on, the background music was flawless, overall it's epic nothing more to say. Highly recommend it.. this may also be the best series to get into the anime world.",10
"
                I won't get into heavy details and I will keep this short;  this show was awesome.  There are many shows where when you watch them, the 20 minutes can't pass by fast enough, but with this show I found myself surprised that the episode was already done when it thought I just started it!  That is a true hallmark for an enjoyable show.  This is a must watch.

                While Brotherhood did start off a little bit too quickly, that's not a big problem at all and it does nothing to mess the series up. I love how in this series, you get to see Edward and Winry, even Al, grow a little more, whether physically or emotionally or both. I like seeing a darker side of Mustang and his relationship with Hawkeye too. The plot was so dark and so much more expanded that at times, it was a little hard to keep up, but I understood it and loved it. The characters and art are amazing, as is the plot and the
                  twists and turns and pure brotherly love (Elric fluff!) The ending of this series made me feel all warm and fuzzy because I was so happy with it, but now I'm just sad that it's ended!",10
"
                For an anime that is ranked one of the highest of all time, let me state one thing that are unpopular to most of the reviews that really stood out to me-- it's the women power that is winning for me.
Almost all my favorite girl characters are found in the series. I patronize how these women are strongly established and profoundly written in the plot, that they are evenly matched to the other male characters of the series. Unlike how the other Shounen animes signify the position of the women as they are minimized to damsels in distresses, and just a tool for the protagonists'
                  emotional and romantic investment that can revitalize their power if their love interest are in verge of danger. 
The FMA: Brotherhood' women are not anything close than it. They are independent, fighters, and epic. Let's start from Mira Armstrong's dominating presence, a formidable and firm leader in high-position, then Izumi, oh dear, she defied the common characterization of a tranquil and reserved image of a mother, as she rules their household and brings down, not only the Elric brothers to their knees, but also she brought down the Central Command. Oh yes, May Chang, my little warrior who unhesitantly and bravely confronted the Father. Lastly, Even Winry Rockbell, she may not as fighter compared to the women mentioned, but the Elric Brothers could not have gone that far without the constant mechanical support from her, and this support is literally their life after all.
There are other more women to be mentioned but it's going to take more paragraphs if I exemplify them all. Even this outstanding women characterization of the series is just a piece of its entire excellence and greatness. From its concept of fundamental law about the equivalent exchange is already interesting to begin with. Then, it bloomed more with its dark yet compelling storylines, brought by improved and well-written characterization in comparison to the older version of the series. In this time, I feel more attached to certain characters like Roy Mustang and Envy because of their relevance accentuation and epic rivalry.  There are even new characters that is introduced, and the story gets even better because of them. 
Ironically, their system of power sounds realistic. There are clear boundaries about their capacity and weaknesses, well, at least for me, I understood it. In line with this, the principle of exchanges and sacrifices bring more realism to the anime, it keeps getting more sense and authentic for audience as the story progresses. The Homunculus are even better written this time. Yes, the FMA (2003) approached it more emotional, but this time, although still they added some emotional flavors to their individuality, but they are much more driven to their positions as antagonists which adds fuel--no a goddamn gasoline and diesel, to their intense heart-throbbing and stupendous battles against the main characters. Yes, I am talking about how Roy Mustang finished Lust and Envy with intense passion where his anguish is converted into a hungered wrath. Damn!
From my viewpoint, how the story ended is justified. It concluded still being faithful to its law principle of equivalent exchange. This law is everything that runs their world. This law is the root of all the personal and external dilemma of each characters that has gone down the history. Edward's sacrifice has justice to it. Moreover, Roy's tragic fate is heart-breaking. Nonetheless. I'm quite glad that the creators remained realistic and did not add some unsolicited miracles to have him a normal life. I am not saying he deserves it, I'm simply telling that things are not an absolute happy ending for everyone. I have a complete satisfaction how it is concluded for all the characters.
I won't further explain the other more aspects that have already been mentioned by other review. To sum it all up, FMA: Brotherhood is a gem, a diamond, and most recommended for people who have not yet seen it. Time might have already gone, but it still stands on the summit, and it shows. This anime is a prime legend to the anime history.",10
"
                This is the only anime I will ever write a review upon.It is the only anime,in my opinion,that deserves to be rated as the best.
Everything about this anime is perfect.Story,characters,pacing,audio,everything is top-notch.Not a single filler in the entire 64 episodes.Each episode has a meaning,everything that happens has somewhat of an impact throughout the story,has a certain impact on the development of the characters,it is just out of this world how good this anime is.
I generally leave a 10 on anime's that are good,but after I've seen this,I will not give out 10's so easily anymore, since I will sadly have to compare every anime I
                  watch to this,and sadly,I don't think I will be able to compare any.
Wholeheartedly recommend this anime to anyone.",10
"
                    Although it is not artistically, sonically and historically perfectly developed, it is the type of anime that makes you love each character regardless of technical defects, so it fills a space in your heart, which is more than enough to receive a 10. 
    The anime manages to develop a loving relationship between two characters in an extremely creative way, where the climax of the development of dating between the two is not something cliché like a kiss or something, it's just incredible.
    The development of the characters is also special, where even surrounded by
                  violence, danger and motivations to give up, they still end up with a happy ending, which can appear somewhat discouraging, but which at the end of the day fulfills its role of improving your day.
    Overall, I loved it :)",10
"
                I watched 2003 version before this. And I am not sure if I can make a ''fresh eye'' review on the 2009 version. Anyway, I was too taken away by the Royai ship that makes me focus on their interactions more than the story itself. I feel bad about it when I cannot enjoy the plot and overall storyline properly. Secondly the team spent a hell lot of cost on top voice actors, making FMA a legend of the decade. The openings and endings are also very nice. I am just feeling sad about the ending of Royai. Small conclusion, though it is a great
                  anime, with 64 episodes and knowing too well the endings of each character, I feel like it would be difficult to watch it twice.",9
"
                This has to be my all time favorite series. I enjoyed every moment of the show. It had both funny and sad moments, it was philosophical to some extend. In short it fit my taste perfectly. Not to mention I watched this show 11 times and I don't regret it at all. I could have watched other anime but I re watched this many times because it is that good. 
I will try not to spoil anything here. The story is well written. The plot is easily understandable and the sub plots makes the show very much interesting. There are twist here and there. There
                  are times when you would go ""whoa!"" because how good the story flow is. The first episode came in 2009. For it's time the animation and art is top notch. There's no reason to say ""Oh! The animation is bad I am not going to watch it."" If you compare it to today's standard it might not be good but let's keep in mind the show started airing in 2009. 
Music and OST is catchy and will stick to your head for a long time. Especially, the first opening and second ending, those are my personal favorite and I am sure you will like them too. Furthermore, I also like how the character is developed in the series. I don't want to spoil anything but I tell you this is one of those series that will make you question whether the protagonist are in the right sometime in the middle of the series. 
As I said I watched the show 11 times so of course I enjoyed the show a lot. 
I would recommend the show. It's worth the watch.",10
"
                As more time goes on and the number of shows I've seen widens in scope, the less I feel enamored by what FMA:Brotherhood offers -
The show is the king of being consistently great, but it never reaches something truly superb - there are some stand-out moments in this show, and I think the strongest aspect of this adaptation is its consistently good pacing and parlaying of information. The show never had a 'golden moment' for me though, a moment where all quintessential parts come together to really blow me away - even shows like mob psycho had more golden moments - but I was also
                  never bored, and I was rarely underwhelmed.",9
"
                There are a lot of shows out there, some try to have a psychological aspect, others a supernatural one. While others create a whole world with their own set of rules, magic, politics, between other aspects. But FMA:B is different, because is doesn't try to do things, failing in the process, it DOES those things. The whole world is credible, the characters are human, and even those who aren´t technically human behave in a way that we, as humans, can understand or even emphasize.
This is a story about humanity, but with an emphasis on our weaknesses, while we always strive for perfection, or at least
                  be better everyday, we are bound to our humanity, our sins, the most obscure aspects of ourselves. We try to be virtuous, only to find that our own imperfection is the one to blame for our failure. But that is the one thing that makes us humans in the first place. In the whole cast, the only character that wasn't human to begin with was the one that forgot that, as a product of humanity, it was bound by that same curse, but by forsaking every weakness that he had, he created one that nobody has. When he thought he had the chance to be perfect, he failed to see that indeed, perfection wasn't in its grasp, and that was his doom.
When I say that FMA:B is a story about humanity itself, I mean it, the weak, the strong, the faithful, the smart, the humble and the evil, all are a part of humanity, and while some of those aspects are indeed considered bad, they are necessary on our society, for without conflict, the world would stagnate.
One mustn´t try to become God, for we humans can only grasp our own nature, and we tend to forgot that is our nature that allows us to reach even the stars if we so desire it, while punishing us when we allow ourselves to fall into cockyness. 
The music and animation are extremely dynamical and feels natural to every scene, and the openings are, even to this day, of the best of the whole industry, not only for their music, but for their emphasis in the part of the history they're covering.
I don't think I'll ever fathom the exact reason why this show caught my attention, and with it, a part of who I am now, for I think that, is part of my own nature as a human being, but not because of my ignorance and lack of trying, but because there will always be something deeper, a new north, a new height. For that, is the fate of humanity.",10
"
                As a fan of the Fullmetal Alchemist series, I went into this show with high hopes and yet was unsure if it would be so much different or better than the other series. After finishing this I was completely blown away by it. This exceeded my expectations and became one of my all-time favorites. 
The story was intense and kept my attention throughout, and had quite a few heart-wrenching moments that really stuck with me even after they passed. There were moments in the show where I was mesmerized and became emotional because of how beautifully done they were. The action was great to marvel
                  at as well, yet the emotional baggage is always present which makes them even more engaging and suspenseful than just a flashy battle. 
Almost every character on the show is fascinating in their own way, with some quickly becoming my favorites. The development of the plot with these characters interwove into something remarkable. I found myself caring about a lot of these characters and becoming engaged with their conflicts and personality quirks. The protagonists, Edward and Alphonse were extremely likable for me and shone extremely bright themselves. Often when watching a series one can become more attached to or interested in a cool side character and even become annoyed with the protagonists, but for this show the protagonists were some of the best parts of the show which was very refreshing. 
This is a Shonen series that really stands out. It isn't heavily reliant on a formulaic approach to the story, and engages the audience in its own special way by breaking certain tropes. The tropes that it may reinforce are done right and don't come across as forced or overdone. 
All in all there are so many memorable moments, touching characters, and a story that works beautifully and left me thinking about the series ever since. An unforgettable series that doesn't drag itself out too long, nor does it end too quick. The story is wrapped up in a thoughtful form that was truly moving.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite anime of all time. It is a shounen anime that is unlike any other. There are so many things that I can praise this anime for and it won't be enough to show how much this show means to me. That is to say I do know there are things that can be criticized about the show and I will express them.
One of the best things of this anime is the usage of themes and how well implemented they are in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Some of the many themes that are in this anime are mortality and immortality, humanity,
                  science and religion, arrogance, search for truth, and obviously brotherhood. 
Characters are another huge aspect of this show. So many of the characters in this show are memorable and well-written. This cast is so full of charm and are the main factors that bring home the themes of this show. Some of my favorites are Greed, Hohenheim, Roy Mustang, Winry, and Edward Elric.
The voice acting is also superb in this show. Whichever language you choose: Japanese or English, will give you an outstanding experience as both versions have fitting people for their characters.
I could go into more and more positives in this show but no piece of entertainment are without flaws. One huge flaw is the beginning of the show. It is fast paced and does not go into full depth of characters like the manga or the 2003 version of Fullmetal Alchemist. This leads to a start that will most likely not leave the majority of people impressed. Some people speculate that the reason for this almost recap-like beginning is due to how close this version and 2003 version in terms of years. This beginning is a recap for those who watched the 2003 and want to get to the parts that differed from the 2003 version. 
Another flaw is the comedy. I personally like the comedy and feel they are there when it is appropriate. However, other people don't see it the same as I do. 
Adding onto subject of opinion are the battle scenes. I have talked to people who have watched this show and one person didn't particularly liked the battles in this show. I will say that this person is more used to traditional shounen battle anime so that may be one thing. However, I can see where he's coming from. The battles are not the central part of this anime as the story and the journey are what this show is all about.
I didn't list all the good things and all the bad things of Fullmetal Alchemist as I do not want to leave anyone good or bad impressions on this anime. I have seen where both go sour and end up sullying the show's enjoyment for someone. So I will say go into this anime with an open mind and try to enjoy what it has to offer. In my opinion, it is one of the best Japanese pieces of entertainment of all time. I give Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood a 9.5/10.",10
"
                If shonen anime are the standard, Fullmetal Alchemist has exceptionally good writing. Its greatest strength is its well-rounded, three dimensional main characters. Edward Elric and Roy Mustang, for example, are among the best to be found in the genre, but the strength of the cast is not without exception: by contrast, even someone as important as Alphonse is quite boring.
Subtlety isn't its strong suit. The brothers moping in the rain or a toy robot walking into Alphonse as he ponders the nature of his being are moments where it feels like they're laying it on thick. Later, characters spout off their motivations and the revelations
                  of their experiences mid-combat, which is a bit patronizing. It gets to the point where it drags down the pace at times, especially in the end, when it feels the need to maniacally tie up the arcs of every bit-player in the story.
The climactic sequences in general are a letdown. They're not the best in terms of the raw action and the villains become hard to take seriously - they take on stupid-looking forms and they practically defeat themselves. You could argue that this gives the series a certain degree of psychological merit, or at least that it works for the characters, but it certainly makes the battles less impactful. The mysterious elements of the story are disappointing once you know the secrets.
FMA is a serious story, dealing with themes like revenge, genocide, and human experimentation, but there are moments where that darkness is poorly handled. Some of the villainous characters have under-developed motivations and there are a lot of comedic moments that don't fit well with the edginess around them. There are some jokes which serve to humanize the characters or create a deliberate sense of contrast, but a lot of the time it feels out of place.
Nothing in this show particularly thrilled me. There are no characters or moments that stand tall above the rest, or that I expect to remember a long time from now. It's undeniably competent, but not much more than that.",7
"
                Here I am again looking down at all the foolish anime which try to compare to Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. The amount of quality here is just unbearable for one to witness, so much so that I had to take several day breaks to take in what Mustang says into full effect. A character can say ""No."" and i'll be stuck there analyzing for a straight week on what they meant by it. For a whole year I was stuck on one episode, breaking down every minor detail and fully embracing the narrative and the direction they decide to take with it. And with 50
                  years of my life dedicated to this show, I'll give you a full review on why Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is the greatest most epic thing of all time and how it'll never be beaten till the end of time.
1. The Groundwork.
Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is all about groundwork, it'll build up the philosophers stone for a bit then not talk about it for awhile then 15 episodes later, bring it back up and lay down all the information for you. And that's simply amazing. It keeps you thinking about all the things mentioned within the series and allows you to think ""Hmmmmm. When will this get brought up again?"" and when it does, it's VERY rewarding.
2. Animation
Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is produced by Square Enix and animated by BONES, so the quality reflects that. Sure the animation dips in quality a bit, but the amount of scenes where the quality is simply unchained really throws you off. It's like watching episode 19 of Demon Slayer every other episode, and it's amazing.
3. Characters
The Characters are very strong here. Well developed, very apparent, and boy oh boy do their narratives fit in perfectly with the narrative of the story. The way the characters all tie in with the world really give you a sense of overwhelming ""OOOOOOOH I REMEMBER HIM/HER"" and when you see that characters face again, it'll make you happy.
4. Story
The story is simply the strongest component here as it never struggles with inconsistencies or plot holes, it always sticks closely together and serves for a really well put together plot with a beautiful narrative.
*SPOILER WARNING*
5. The Promised Day
The last few episodes are really amazing and it puts you on edge, bye DAD!
10/10",10
"
                Alright so this is my first ever review and I wanted to write one on an anime that I've really enjoyed watching, so here I am. 
-SPOILER FREE-
Where to begin on this. I personally don't like anime that's more than 24 episodes at the most. So I was kind of weary of starting one that is (with other few anime's that are an exception). Man was I so happy that I did. 
Brotherhood is a reboot of the original Fullmetal Alchemist, that follows the manga, which I've read and heavily enjoyed reading as well. Brotherhood is far better than the old one. Animations looked somewhat
                  similar, but Brotherhood would be far superior for me. 
-This anime is very action pact. 
-Animation is fantastic.There were so many great action and battle scenes that were very well put.  
-It has very well put character development. The emotion for each character, that was showed throughout the whole anime was top notch. 
-The OP + ED MUSIC, god I freaking loved it.
-The plot and story line are amazing. I thought the way the anime had ended was very good and I was happy with the way it had ended. 
Overall a really good ride. Please watch it, if you haven't already. You won't regret it!",10
"
                I'll start this Review by saying that this is my favorite anime, but come on, never recommend this anime to people who are just starting to watch anime, this can ruin her pleasure with all the upcoming anime that she will see in life, Fullmetal is a play -prima of Japanese animation, the story is very beautiful, dramatic that holds you to watch more and more (10/10), the animation is from Bones Studio so it's something really beautiful, the battle scenes, the effects, the dash very strong in some moments they leave everything more beautiful (9/10), this anime has a light comedy and is something
                  really funny, the characters are highly charismatic and you will surely like them and will hate some others a lot (10/10), OST and battle music is something very good and in the Openings of the anime are witnessed wonderful songs, surely you will like some (9/10), the pleasure watching this anime depends a lot on your day and mood, you may not like the conv and you will not have a great pleasure or you are in a good mood and you will like it, the battles are always very exciting so it's kind of hard not to like them but they are not very strategic and this is not so good (7/10), then as a final note I'll give this anime a 9 for all it is a set, can watch without fear and do not call the number of episodes, it is an incredible experience.",9
"
                Summary;  It balances between all the aspects that make a good show (animation, osts, story, themes, characters etc.) perfectly and has very little flaws. Decent story, likeable characters, adventure in a beautiful atmospheric world, interesting fantasy elements/concepts, philosophical themes, mysteries/conspiracies/plot twists, cool action scenes and epic moments, its has everything. As a result this anime has a very broad appeal.
The good points: 
It does almost everything right (story, characters, themes etc.)
Really shines out in terms of:
Consistency of quality
Crazy pay offs for build-ups or shocking scenes that come out of nowhere (epic moments)
Diverse atmospheric steampunk world
Exploring fantasy elements through a scientific or research based manner
Plot-twist/mystery
                  reveals/conspiracies
Melodious osts perfect for various types of scenes
A long adrenaline fueled final arc involving a massive showdown between the good guys and the bad guys, which converges (and terminates) numerous character arcs as well.
The bad points: 
A few of the fantasy elements feel random or don't make much sense.
One fantasy element which is a rule of this show's magic system (alchemy) is inconsistent with a military law and something that happens in the beginning of the show.
The pilot and a few episodes at the beginning aren't as good as the rest of the show and are somewhat rushed compared to the source material.
It gets slightly slow or loses momentum at one point in the middle of the series.
The main villain is slightly underwhelming.
Story: The story is fine.
An atmospheric steampunk fantasy involving lots of lively  and likeable characters with different but understandable motivations, all of which are in some way or the other related to a nation's government with many dark secrets.
The story also involves a little bit of lore like a little bit of mythology, a war that happened in recent history, an abrupt fall of a civilization etc. All this adds more depth to the story.
The use of interesting concepts that require detailed explanation which drive the story (like those based on country relations, economy, fantasy, sci-fi elements etc.), themes of the story depicted in a natural manner, multiple subplots involving fleshed out characters with conflicting and understandable motivations interwoven with each other, interesting situations created naturally involving high tension etc. makes a story interesting and complex. FMAB handles these things pretty good.
Themes: After giving much thought, I can say that the themes are handled perfectly. All the themes it raises like 'flying too close to the sun', 'the value of a human soul' or 'to gain something, something of equal value must be sacrificed' are integrated very naturally in the story and are depicted through various events. The arrogant desires of human to bend the laws of nature for their gain irrespective of how much sacrifice it requires is what starts and further drives the story. The bitter consequences of it (flying too close to the sun) and the sacrifice for the sake of something truly invaluable for us as humans is how it ends. I can't elaborate on it without spoiling so I'll leave it at that but just from reading this much one can tell, how thematically consistent and well planned the story is. Nothing is forced. Furthermore all the character have a certain central idea or theme associated with them as explained in characters section.
Characters: Characters are fine.
The characters are sufficiently fleshed out i.e. they show different emotions that you would expect them to in a given situation so they don't come across as one dimensional. Their relationship/behavior with each other also varies depending upon the pair. No character sticks too unrealistically closely to a single trait. All characters have a unique personality with respect to each other.
Their personality is complimented by their respective character design i.e. most characters look how you would expect them to based on their personality.
The characters have understandable motivations and their actions are consistent with those motivations.
No character is obnoxious and many of them from the good side can even be likeable including the MC duo.
Many character have certain main ideas associated with them like duty vs humanity, guilt, vengeance, handling of power of evil origin etc. The ideas or traits to be more precise associated with the secondary villains are the seven sins they are named after but they aren't one dimensional by any means. The termination of their arcs with respect to the idea they represent is done perfectly and involve a great sense of irony for almost all of them except lust. These characters explore these ideas throughout their story.
All character arcs converge in an epic finale very smoothly. No character is ignored. Even the relatively minor characters aren't ignored. MC grows in maturity (and height) gradually that you wouldn't even notice. Everyone gets some lesson related to the ideas associated with them or what you call development till the end.
The main villain however while not bad by any means may feel somewhat underwhelming when compared to other villains which is to say that he doesn't strike as particularly interesting or menacing for all the hype created. The theme associated with him however is explored perfectly. 
Fantasy: The fantasy elements are pretty sensible and interrelated by anime standard
The fantasy elements mainly consists of alchemy and a small mythology. 
Alchemy is of 2 types: normal and soul alchemy
Normal alchemy can be used to change shape and volume of substances by making a transmutation circle. When used in fights it can be pretty creative.
Soul alchemy is slightly more complex. It is a pretty interesting concept that has been used multiple times in the show.
There are many research related to alchemy involving alchemy to produce interesting results like secret to immortality, philosohper's stone, human transmutation, giagantic transmutation circle, flame alchemy, alkahistory, scar's (one of the character) alchemy, body armor, chimeras etc. These research related things are pretty sensible and add more intrigue to the show. Its one of the best aspects of the show.
The fantasy elements have a certain look to them which distinguish them from other series. Red lightning, the way matter disintegrates, magical eyes that we see many times in the show, tangible shadows etc. look very unique, iconic that just by looking at them you can tell that they are from fmab. I really like it when a series has a unique set of fantasy elements similar to how light sabers from star wars look iconic.
However a law of alchemy says that the nature of substances can't be changed using alchemy. However the MC in one episode converted coal to gold. Plus there's a military law that prohibits such activities. If it was possible to change nature of matter, the MCs could've found easier alternatives to certain situations. The author made a mistake here.
Another minor thing i find weird is that flame alchemy can't be used when its source that is spark creating gloves with transmutation circle drawn on them is wet. Sparks can be created even in rain so it doesn't make much sense.
Coming to the mythology part. It isn't very elaborated. The main villain's origins isn't explained but thats one of the things that he himself was looking for so its ok.
The thing that i find somewhat weird is that using soul alchemy the villain splits his personality into 7 sins of Christianity and imbues them in a human body's soul to take control over that body, and also imbues it with philosopher stone (a fantasy object of power in the show) to give them random powers and regenerative abilities after lots of experimenting. The result is called homunculus. That means in the world of fma, the soul comprises of 7 vices and virtues of Christianity. I am not fond of this concept because i feel that it might not be an entirely comprehensive classification with mutually exclusive classes/groups and is probably outdated. For example, i think greed and gluttony (excess greed for food) aren't mutually exclusive and gluttony is a form of greed. Also we don't get to see how separation of these sins from his body changed the main villain. He clearly has lots of greed and pride even after he separated them from his body. We have to assume that he didn't remove all of it but it isn't explicitly mentioned. Infact one character once said that removing these sins from one's soul means removing one's humanity if I remember correctly. Did his pride and greed reduce after the separation? Also after seeing the origin story of the villain you can't help but wonder did he really have lust in him? One thing i do like about the separation of sins concept is that, in Christianity, in order to get closer to the God which is equivalent to truth in a symbolic way in fma and is related to the villain's motivations, one must separate themselves from the seven vices or sins which means separation of sins is a part of the process that leads the villain to his goals but he also used it to get some homunculi goons to help in the process. This is also related to one of the main themes of the show that is introduced in very early parts of the show 'flying too close to the sun' where sun can be a metaphor for God. Also I feel that the powers are too random. Their powers should be based on alchemy. However one of them has the power to control shadows and turn them into a sharp and strong weapons. It might be a cool technique but shadow is not even an object in the first place so how can he use alchemy on it? Another of the homunculus have access to another dimension which is contained in a small space but is way larger when inside. How is dimension creation related to alchemy? Two of the homunculi have access to super speed. Again how is this related to alchemy? 
Its not explained why only a few individuals have access to the doors  (fantasy object that look like doors; source of alchemy) of alchemy.
Enjoyment: Its a very enjoyable and consistent series. I'll discuss the various categories that makes it enjoyable.
Epic scenes: The epic scenes are absolutely amazing. t has lots of highly energetic epic moments (pay off for build-up or abrupt shocking scenes). These epic moments mostly involve amazing fight scenes which the audience waits for but there are many other types of epic scenes as well (like mystery reveals or involving large scale destruction in important places).
Action: The action scenes are amazing.
Its fight scenes are brief but absolutely amazing. Well choreographed, strategic and involving lots of destruction.
Alchemy makes the fight scenes somewhat diverse and unique since each alchemist has a unique power that must be used in a unique way. It doesn't involve ass-pulls or bizarre logic or strategies. Fights can involve lots of simple but clever tricks instead of some bizzare strategy that conveniently ignores physics and fantasy rules of the series with a narrator or character going on and on to justify it.
The power levels are consistent. Some characters are op (like their single touch can kill, or a snap of their fingers can burn anything or they move too fast) but thats the best part because its interesting to see how these fights will go and some massacres (one sided fights) are incredibly satisfying.
World building:
It doesn't have a detailed map.
There aren't many iconic locations that appear frequently and become of great importance. None that i remember of.
However its world is very diverse and beautiful. Its has places like a military base covered in snow, beautiful windy european countryside, tunnels with rail-tracks, beautiful old civilization etc.
The world design is detailed, atmospheric and diverse. 
Adventure: Pretty good.
Beautiful world design brimming with energy with lively characters especially the MC who are looking for answers in various places makes it a good adventure series.
Comedy:
The comedy is ok. The character interactions are comical in normal situations. Sometimes it can become philosophical. In serious moments it is suitably dark.
Mystery:
A very important aspect of the show. The MCs set out on a journey to learn about how to regain their biological body (which is replaced by metallic parts). This leads them to learn about various dark secrets related to the world they live in. We learn along with them and its really interesting to see things gradually starting to make sense. Natirally there are many plot-twists as well.
It has mystery surrounding the country the characters live in, the father of the MC duo, a war that happened recently, a major event that happened in the past that ended an entire civilization and all the research areas related to alchemy. All of these secrets are related to each other.
Music:
It has music for all kinds of situation which suit the scenes perfectly. Most of its music is orchestral and very melodious. It elevates all the scenes to greater heights and complements the beautiful artstyle. Its osts are easily among the best in a show. Also the openings and endings are very visually immersive. The voice acting is great and the dub is very good.
Animation: 
Good looking and consistent.
Among very few shows that end satisfactorily. The last arc is insanely good. It may not have the best start and may lose some momentum in the middle but it still pretty good during those parts. Its 60+ episodes long but its very consistent and ends amazingly.",9

                What all shounen should aspire to be.
You probably heard or read good things about this anime on more than one occasion, let me tell you that they are all true, a story with a great world, mythology, well-developed cast of characters, all at the service of a well-constructed plot that is not taken anymore of the necessary time, full of epic and exciting moments, that do not treat the public as idiots, so they propose to cover deep subjects with the seriousness it deserves and all with the best animation that the Bones studio can offer.
I could do a more extensive analysis but it would
                  not be up to the height that this work deserves, so I only deign to throw roses at it.",10

                [STORY: 10/10]
Brotherhood is an adaption of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga written by Hiromu Arakawa after it was possible to faithfully adapt it, unlike the original show that came out during the early stages of the series that relied on filler to continue thriving. Due to this and Arakawa's magnificent writing, we have one of the best stories told through the anime medium with this new adaptation of her work. The story of Edward and how he comes to understand the world around him and matures is really an unforgettable treat and a pleasure to behold. The others characters are done just as much justice, as
                  they all grow and contribute to the main story in an important way, which is an extremely impressive thing to pull off.
[ART: 10/10]
The graphics are very much improved for this adaptation of the show when compared to the original, which is appreciated a great deal. The character designs are pretty similar to the previous show, but there are improvements and new designs that only make it a better experience as a whole.
[SOUND: 10/10]
Some voice actors return to their roles for this adaptation, but there are a few new actors that turn out to be an advantage for this series. The new voice actors do a perfect job at showing us these character's raw emotions through their portrayal. The soundtrack is also upped in quality, and it proves to be yet another positive alteration.
[CHARACTER: 10/10]
As I said in the story section, these are one of the most solid casts of characters I've witnessed in anime and it's extremely faithful to the manga. Nobody's potential feels wasted and by the end, you feel that the characters were impeccably fleshed out and that their stories were settled and complete enough to satisfy us by the the time the show has concluded.
[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 10/10]
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood hits every mark for me. It's has an incredibly addicting story, the art and design is very well done, the actors portray the characters perfectly, and every character has real purpose and feels like they belong. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of my favorites of all time and I'll never forget the beauty of this masterfully done show.",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood is one of the top #1 anime on MyAnimeList and one of my favorite anime and I have many reasons to like and favorite this anime
1) The background story is interesting
"" Tells the story of two brothers named Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric who tried to revive his mother from the dead using the power of Alchemists but unfortunately his efforts failed and the two of them who were still small did not know that human ""Transmutation"" had to be paid dearly as a result, Edward lost his left leg temporarily. Alphonse lost his whole body but Edward managed to save
                  his brother Alphonse's soul into a suit of armor by sacrificing his right hand then began the journey of the brothers to get their bodies back ""
2) Many emotional moments of this anime have succeeded in playing with our emotions as viewers, do not hesitate to turn off the characters and the affection of the brothers is quite touching
3) The battle is fun, the battle here is not only about strength, they also use very situational tactics and science
4) The animation graphics are good and every fight is well animated
5) There are many characters but all of them are important and useful. My favorite character is the Elric Brothers because they are both cool and never give up
6) The villain is cool, the enemy uses the ""Seven Deadly Sins"" concept that exists in humans
7) This anime teaches the meaning of equal exchange that in essence we have to sacrifice something to achieve our desires
8) Bureaucratic politics here are also well packaged and described
9) Have philosophical values ​​that make the audience rethink and reflect on the meaning of life, death, and the universe
10) Lastly, I really like and satisfied with the ending
I think the anime Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood really fits in the #1 MyAnimeList",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a perfect reboot.
The story is GOOD- 7/10, it focuses on Edward and Alphonse, this show has no flaws at all, the story is consistent and maintains it's structure and depth. However it doesn't reach the complexity and amazingness as something that's 8/10 and above, so my only complaint is how overrated this show is. THAT IS ITS ONLY FLAW. 
Shows like One Piece FOR SURE has flaws in story at times, but there's also those moments where it goes above expectations hence it would score for me better than this flawless consistent story which conversely doesn't have moment as such.
The art
                  is also GOOD- 7/10, simple designs, easy to distinguish, no complaints here again
Sound is very good - 8/10, it really brings out the emotions that you should get when watching this show and is used during the right moments.
Characters are good, some are very good I'd say 7.5/10, this show has a memorable cast with good backstories and purpose, the villains are good and don't feel overused for the sake of it.
Enjoyment - 7/10, thought this show was good, had no complaints, it was just a fun watch but won't have a huge impact on me on a whole
OVERALL - 7/10, pretty good show to get people into anime, and shouldn't be a problem for anyone to watch.
MAY BE BORING DURING THE FIRST FEW EPISODES IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN FMA",7

                (THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS)
Ok so, i finished watching this show a couple of days ago, and i have to say that is by far the best anime i've ever seen. This anime is perfect in all senses: The story is awsome, philosophical and very catching, the art is really good, the soundtracks are amazing, one of the best i have heard in anime, the character development is just impressive, i enjoyed it so damn much. Of course people say there are other anime that can be compared (Code Geass, Death Note, etc) But for me this is the best of all times. 
One of the
                  best things about this anime, is that you feel so many emotions. For example: When i started watching it, i felt so bad for Ed and Al, and i was hoping so much that they got their bodies back. At the end of the anime, when Al gets his body back, and Ed too (except for his leg) I felt a huge feeling of satisfaction and  relief that i started crying of happines. This anime has all the emotions on earth. It teaches you so many things. Its a masterpiece. My mind is blown after watching it.
If you havent seen it, stop what your doing, and go and watch it. You will have the best anime experience on earth.

                f there is no way out, then you can always do it!
My acquaintance with this wonderful anime series was quite long. That there was no time, then the opportunity to watch it ... Very often I came across reviews, mostly laudatory, but did not pay much attention to them. It just so happened that I do not read the number of positive reviews as an indicator of the quality of anime / film / book, etc.
But when it finally happened, and I watched this series, I was absolutely delighted! Yes, nothing really fascinated me except for Candy-Candy, Harry Potter and Avatar: the legends of the
                  Aang. I just could not tear myself away from this series. The main characters and the plot immediately sunk into the soul and was drawn to find out - and what next?
What upset and even outraged, is the assaults on this anime in the style of: 'It's not in manga', 'Brotherhood is better', etc. No, the Brotherhood is no better! I will express my opinion about it in another review, but I want to say that this series is much deeper in plot than the original manga and the Brotherhood. Yes, it usually happens that an impromptu production cannot surpass the original. But in this case it is.
So, what we have: there is a world parallel to ours (which was confirmed at the end of the series), in which medieval science - alchemy - developed. Yes, at first glance it might seem that this alchemy is akin to magic in Harry Potter, but not so simple! Very quickly we are given to understand that alchemy is precisely SCIENCE (although sometimes it still reminds magic), and it is based on the laws of nature, the main of which is the law of equivalent exchange. 'One cannot get something out of nothing. To get something, one must give back something of equal value ”- this law reads. Let us now recall how Harry Potter and his friends turned living rats and ravens into goblets and back in the classroom, while the animals remained alive! Well this is a digression. The world of Alchemy is completely different. It seems to be similar to our world at the beginning of the 20th century, but at the same time it is closer to steampunk and diesel punk. The fashion of this world is modernized, but simplified. If the heroes wear mi-skirts, then there are no hints of all kinds of sparkles, prints and the like, which makes me personally happy.
Plot: As many could read on Wikipedia, the plot is based on the story of two brothers - Edward and Alphonse Elrikov, who lost their mother at a fairly young age and decided to bring her back to life with the help of alchemy. But the children did not take into account the same law of equivalent exchange, as a result of which the older, Ed, lost his leg, and the younger Al, the whole body. In a desperate attempt to save his brother. Ed also sacrifices his hand and attaches his brother's soul to the armor in the basement of their house. After a while, familiar auto mechanics set Edu prostheses-auto armor instead of arms and legs and the brothers go on a dangerous path in the hope of recovering what was lost. Soon, the boys learn about the philosopher's stone and from now on decide to find it at all costs. Such a plot plot few people can leave indifferent. I will not reveal all the secrets of the plot, but the ending in this series is very unexpected! Predicting it is almost impossible! I can reassure those who are especially impressionable, except that the brothers will eventually achieve their goal. True, they will again have to pay dearly for this.
Characters: This is what you can talk about for a very long time. There are a lot of interesting and simply charming characters. The characters are all different, for every taste, so to speak. The characters and relationships of the characters are revealed very well. When you look at them, you even forget that they are all painted and perceive them as real people. So they are alive, natural and multifaceted in terms of characters.
It's not impossible not to fall in love with the Elric brothers. They are quite different in character, but at the same time they are incredibly similar in their mentality and determination. They are touched to the depths of their souls by brotherly love, caring for each other and attempts to return what was lost precisely to their brother, and not to themselves. These boys suffered a lot of rather cruel trials, but they go through life with their heads held high. Ed, although hot-tempered and sometimes cynical, Al, in contrast to his brother, is quite reasonable. But both brothers are very strong in spirit, kind and incredibly optimistic. And to keep all this in your heart, seeing all the cruelties of life from childhood, is very difficult!
I would also like to mention other memorable characters - the head of the brothers, Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Lisa Hawkeye, Major Maes Hughes madly adoring his wife and daughter, childhood friend of the guys Winry Rockbell, fond of auto-armor, alchemy teacher of many other Izumi Curtis brothers and many ... The characters turned out bright and memorable. Each has its pros and cons, as well as its own personal drama.
The villains are just as impressive. Some homunculi are worth it! I think it will be more interesting to find out who they are and where they came from. Among them there are both inveterate villains and scum that has ended, and quite pleasant and even tragic characters.",10

                Where do I even begin. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, the #1 anime to top MAL's anime list of best anime of all time. Now if you're like me, than you too watched this after the '03 anime adaptation and that one was; interesting. Great story none the less but this isn't about that.
Now, FMAB is the ONLY anime that I've rewatched 3x (as of the writing of this, I'm currently rewatching for a 4th time) and that is for a reason. 
THIS ANIME IS GROUNDBREAKING. 
Right out of a golden age of anime in the late 2000s and it shows with all it's badges and glory.
                  Now let's get started.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the story of two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric whom are both ingenious alchemist of their own right. These two are on a journey to  obtain their original bodies back after an alchemic experiment gone wrong. Ed loses his leg and right arm while Al loses his entire body. Ed does bond his brother's soul to a set of armor which Al can control at will. But along their journey the encounter many foes and allies to help them achieve their goal, but the young siblings don't yet understand what the journey means for the people the meet.
This story of two brothers is incredible and their development, along with the supporting group of charming and endearing allies of theirs, is phenomenal. I wish i  could watch-NO... experience this story again for the first time. It's just so heartbreaking and inspiring and exhilarating and a whole bunch of adjectives for something amazing. Now I don't want to rehash what's already been said for the story so if this would be your first time experiencing FMAB, than be prepared for a great story full of quirky characters and a who-dun-it plot of sorts.
The art style. This story has a very steampunk aesthetic and a distinguished  European influence. The character design and settings of the show are great and are pleasant for the eye to look at. I'm not one for judging art but FMAB has a great appeal to it and shouldn't be overlooked. 
Don't get me started on the sound, I can have a full essay on why the ost/openings/endings/environmental sounds of the show are A1 and amazing. The voice acting for both the dubbed and subbed are beautiful and fit perfectly. I won't say anymore on the sound because i would just be rambling. Amazing sound and music overall 
FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST
FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST
I've said all i could considering character and enjoyment. Everyone is great and i enjoy this so much I've rewatched it 3x without getting bored (currently as of writing this it's my 4th time rewatching)
Studio bones has done a wonderful job animating this show and it will continue to be one of the greats, especially in the west. 
10/10 ACROSS THE BOARD",10

                Story (10/10):
The story is incredible! It is well thought out and deep from the start till the end. The story writing is flawless with almost no plotholes. The flow of the story was smooth and had a rather good pacing, it wasn't rushed anywhere and had no at all fillers. The ending was really satisfying.
The story is a bit slow at the beginning so it may be a little boring, but give it some time, it is a built-up to the climaxing scenes towards the end. I do wish they had more alchemists, they featured only a select few even though it is known as
                  the land of alchemy.
Art (10/10):
For something that was drawn in 2009, it has some good animation BUT is not the best. Better than some anime in recent years though. The battle scenes were also EPIC. Really liked the character designs, waifus are prettily drawn.
Sound (10/10):
All the OP and ED are so good, personally think OP 3 is the best. The voice acting fits all the characters and also conveys the necessary emotions.
Character (10/10):
All characters are likable, even villains in fact (except for that guy on Ep 4). The villains are well thought out, they had their own motives and aren't there just because they are evil. Some side characters and villains even got character development. The MCs aren't exactly the strongest but nothing wrong with that, in fact, it makes you wonder how they would eventually defeat the villain.
Enjoyment (10/10):
Not much fan-service but that's alright. A lot of comedic scenes that are solid and funny. I also really enjoyed the quotes that they gave. This anime is extremely unforgettable and will forever be etched in my mind.
Overall (10/10):
Just watch it, its number 1 on MAL for a reason c:",10

                FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood.
Its hard to be fair in a review for an anime with so much to it. I feel a need to post a review, but at the same time you just can't be fair to such a great anime without spoiling it all.
A few things about it: Its quite long. Completely original. No fillers. Great characters. Great story. Memorable music. Great OPs. Moments of goosebump epicness.
Its one of the few animes I own hardcopies of because its also rewatchable.
Its an adventure. It has everything one can ask for as the anime covers all the bases at one point or another. It doesn't limit
                  itself to one term or genre.
Whats more to say? Go try it. Go watch it. Its one of the greatest animes of all time for a reason. That reason being it is really damn good from the start and only gets better by the finish.",10
"
                I am writing this review after only 5 episodes so i might rewrite it if my opinion changes. I have watched all of the original FMA and read the manga. From what ive seen of brotherhood, like the description, it follows the manga. Though the main plot is similar between the anime and the manga the side plots vary. I noticed that the art of the show is different... since when did you see eds hair not in a pony tail??? Overall this seems like an above average show, but not epic by any means.

                This anime is complete masterpiece without a flaw and really deliver the story with a perfect buildup and a satisfactory ending.
The story have never any plot hole and is consistent to the storyline. Every character MCs,  side characters and even the villains have progression and good development that in some cases you will root for the villain. The buildup is smooth not messing really messing up and you really feel immersed to the anime as it progresses. Every episodes deliver excitement, suspense, horror, emotional and attached to the charters and make you really look forward to the next episode.
The music and art is good
                  as it also compliment the story of the anime.",10
"
                For a long time I put off watching this series, mainly because I had seen the original and, while I did get through it, I felt like it was incredibly overrated and would never consider rewatching it. I made the mistake of assuming Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was going to be like the original anime... and I was so very wrong. It has been a year or two since I finished it, so bear with me if I'm a bit inaccurate on some things.
Story - 10
Compared to the older anime adaptation and other series in general, this story is nothing short than amazing. It is one
                  of few shows rated a 9+ on here that I don't feel was even a little bit overrated. Unlike most anime series it follows the manga, which is probably a good part of why it is so good. I know no anime is perfect and part of the reason I probably enjoyed it so much is because I wasn't expecting much, but from what I've seen this is as close to perfect as any series is going to get. It pretty much stays the same as the older anime up until around episode 13 or so, then it becomes completely different.
Art - 9
The art isn't perfect, but it is still pretty good. It definitely does not make the series any less enjoyable and I actually think it suits this series. While I can think of series with better art, I just can't imagine this series with a different style.
Character - 10
It isn't just the main characters that are interesting, all of them are. I'm not sure how to describe the characters other than that they only serve to make this series more enjoyable and there is plenty of character development.
Sound - 8
It has a pretty good soundtrack and the theme songs are enjoyable. There are a few songs I did not like, but Period by Chemistry has to be one of my favorite songs now. Like the art it is not perfect, but it is still pretty good and for the most part it fits into the series. This is probably a matter of opinion more so than anything else is.
Ending - 9
One problem I see with a lot of series, is that they have a bad ending. I'm not going to talk about what actually happened in the end, but while not perfect it is definitely a lot better than the older anime and most other series I have seen.
Enjoyment - 10
I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I wasn't enthusiastic about it when I first started watching it, but since watching this it has easily become my favorite anime of all time. This is probably the only series I might actually re-watch.
Overall this is one of the few series I would actually give a 10/10. You may look at the ratings and think this is overrated, but I think it has earned its high rating. It has been a long time since I finished this(roughly a year or two, I would say) and I am still impressed by this series. If you have watched the older anime and didn't like it, do not let that affect whether you watch this series or not - trust me, this is a LOT better than the older anime.",10

                *Review contains spoilers*
Story 9/10
The story is original, well written and with a good pace. It was very interesting to see stories and events interconnect, meaning, things that happened during first episodes are brought back way later in the show at times when you don't even remember this or that happened. The anime does use comedy as a relief from tragic/tense moments, but it didn't feel overdone or like it took away from the story...tragedy and comedy usually go hand by hand and don't necessary have to compete between each other. I really liked the fighting sequences and how most of the times battles were a
                  ""free for all"" kind of scenario, where X person was fighting Y person but then Z person arrived and then X and Y started fighting Z together, but when Z was gone, X and Y started fighting again. I also liked the alliances people formed for a greater objective. I must say I found this anime a lot deeper and more emotional than I thought it would be!
The are only a few weakness that prevent me from giving this section a 10. First, I did not like how Edward seemed to be more highly regarded than Alphonse, when Alphonse thought, researched, struggled, helped and sacrificed himself just as much as Edward did. I felt Al was often forgotten about while Edward was given all the spotlight and merit for things they had both done, and in fact, some of which Ed would have not been able to accomplish without Al. Second, I felt there were many things not quite explained and left me wondering. For example, how/why was the first homunculus (Father) created? In the anime, all we get to know is that Hohenheim's blood was used for it. Why were the Homunculus chasing Scar initially? Also, why was Mustang chosen as a sacrifice? Because the explanation for the other 4 was that they had already transmuted with human beings but he was forced to do it, so why him? it seemed any other alchemist would have worked. And like this, there are some details of events or characters that could have been explored a bit more so they could have made more sense for the story. Third, many characters were alchemist but at times, to solve simple issues or offer simple solutions to complex issues, they completely forgot about their powers for no apparent reason (ex: when the car in which Yoki, Heinkel, Dr. Marcoh and Al were travelling got a stuck tire, they were trying to pull it out and eventually left the car when Al could have done some alchemy to get the car moving...in fact, I kept thinking why didn't he use his powers to find a quicker way to arrive at Central instead or running?...and like this, there are plenty of examples through the anime). 
The ending is very satisfactory, although I was surprised to see almost all characters getting happy endings because of the dark and somber nature of the anime. I was ready to have either Mustang, Hawkeye or Al die. Also, ready to see Al not being able to get his body back. Don't get me wrong, I am very pleased with the ending, just a bit surprised as I was prepared for the worst. I think the best that happened was Hohenheim dying because I couldn't completely forgive or justify him leaving his children and wife behind and I don't think it would have been believable that him, Ed and Al became just one happy family after everything that happened. It would have taken a lot of time for those wounds to heal.
On a side note: am I the only one surprised that they had such high tech as Automail and could do alchemy, but they didn't even have cellphones? Very archaic communication and means of transportations...also, was I the only one worried that Ed and Al were not going to school? I mean, Edward already had a job and I guess nobody expected him to continue school, but what about Al? 
Art 9/10
I imagine a lot of money must have been invested into making this anime because the drawings look very fresh and modern, even though this is from 2009. Colors were vibrant and a lot of attention to details was made (ex: Mustang's hand wound healing slowly over the episodes, Winry's earrings holes were visible when she was not wearing her earrings, etc). I really enjoyed the art of this anime.
Sound 10/10
Voice acting was completely on point (just thinking about the desperation on Envy's voice during his last moments gives me goosebumps!!). Openings and endings were also on point, with me actually putting at least half of them in my playlist. The only thing I really hated was the voiceover of the anime's name when the show is supposed to go on commercial break!
Characters 10/10
Jesus Christ!! I find so remarkable the fact that a show can have so many characters, each of them so interesting, that it felt none of them got enough screen time. I can honestly say that no character was irrelevant and I wanted to know more about all of them. My absolute favorites are Mustang, Scar and Ling.
I liked Mustang because the guy was a mastermind! He was able to think one step ahead and make a plan involving so many people without failure. I loved the scene where he almost loses his mind while finishing off Envy and how he had to be brought back to his senses by others. I found it very realistic and human like. With Scar, as soon as he was introduced I knew he wasn't a villain at all, but an anti-hero. Although unjustified, I felt his initial motives were understandable and I loved to see him slowly changing his perceptions about Amestrians and his behavior towards people in general. I liked Ling because he was introduced as this goofy and careless character, when all of that in fact seemed to just be a charade to hide his true power. Obviously, he is powerful because he could share his body with Greed and engage in direct combat with the homunculus without major loses or wounds. Many things were accomplished because of Ling's/Greed help and I wish he had gotten more screen time than he did.
Edward was a very stubborn child, but I believe precisely for that reason he was able to go as far as he did. I liked his perseverance and tenacity. I felt Al was more mature than Ed, but sometimes could be a bit too naive for his own good. Al is a kind and noble soul, that got exactly the ending he deserved. I loved to see how Ed and Al remained completely true to their character through the whole anime. I enjoyed to see these kids being able to preserve joy, a lightness of heart and joke around in an age appropriate manner despite all the horrors and pain they went through. 
I can't finish this section without pointing out how most of the villains were so amazingly written that you couldn't help being interested or feeling bad for them. Honestly I didn't care much about Gluttony, Lust, Sloth, Pride and Wrath, although I understand they were there for a reason. I really believe each character's design contributed to their personality a lot more than one might think. For example, King Bradley (Wrath) was cool and under control most of the time (oposite to what that emotion means). Pride, a young boy and the most faithful son, who would even put himself in danger to fulfil his father's wishes, to me represented how much he 
was willing to put at stake to be praised by his father. Yet, my absolutely favorite villians were Greed and Envy. I liked Greed because he acted very accordingly to his name, doing what would better suit his interests, regardless of whether his actions would put him with the bad or the good team. I liked how by the end Greed realized what he truly wanted the most. I think his pairing with Ling was smartly done because Ling in some ways was greedy himself. I liked Envy because he was a consistent villain throughout the anime, not easy to get rid of, and also showed some character development, at least by the end of his life. His last speech was very powerful and made for my favorite episode (54). I can't help to wonder whether Envy was given the transforming power so he could ""become"" whoever he felt envious of?
Side note: wasn't Kimble the craziest guy alive? His logic was so off that I found it too funny (never forget when Pride swallowed him and then wondered how Kimble was still alive with all those souls in sorrow and Kimble's answer was ""this is like music to my ears!!).
Enjoyment 10/10
A few people had been recommending this anime for ages now, but I kind of stayed away from it because I felt the synopsis was not appealing enough...man, was I wrong! I binged-watched this in a span of 3-4 days because I could not stop watching...It seems like every single episode ends in this cliffhanger that makes it almost imposible not knowing the outcome right away. 
Overall 10/10
I know many people see this anime as a masterpiece and a must watch...I am not a 100% sure I feel this way but I would totally recommend it.",10
"
                I won't say much, I won't even tell you what this is about. Rather, I'll say the impact this anime had on me. I had originally watched ""Fullmetal Alchemist,"" the original adaptation of the manga - which I have still not read - and while it was quite good, I never expected Brotherhood to be so superior in comparision.
Everything about this anime is great, the reason I gave the art a 9 is probably because its not the usual anime art you would be used to, so I guess I'm just being picky. 
There are a number of things I would say to describe this,
                  but most of all it's inspirational. You can relate to the characters because they're not perfect, normally an anime might have someone who is stronger than the rest all the way 'till the end, but the characters in this anime show that everyone has weaknesses, and one of the main ways this is portrayed is through the '7 deadly sins,' which are named throughout the anime.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gives you a sense of what really matters in life, with mind-blowing action and an incredible, addictive soundtrack to boot. Everything about this anime keeps you on your toes, as you walk beside the Elric brothers as they go through their journey, meeting fascinating new characters and learning valuable life lessons along the way.
If you haven't already watched this anime, start it. If you've dropped it, pick it up. The very least that this anime deserves is to be viewed to its full potential, and I hope that it touches, excites, and satisfies you as much as it did me.",10
"
                This anime offers a full-packed experience not only letting you re-live life in a make-believe domain but has intertwined the sad face of reality. Lesson-wise, it nailed it. Power-wise, superb! 
Story-wise, this one showed how greed for power can drive wars and countless sacrifices. The journey of Edward and Al has led us to different faces of life. Don't have any comment for improvement as this is a masterpiece. Trophy!
What I like most from this anime is its way to make people realize that in every desire our hearts have, there's always an equivalent price to pay. Check and balance is what this anime has
                  from the very beginning. Their powers rooted from countless sacrifices are representative of how real people with unparalleled influence have attained the seat of authority - a bloody combination of abuse and violence.",10
"
                I'll make it very simple. It's a great show, but it has a few flaws, which really sometimes can't be helped. Heads up, this is my first review, but I'm 99.999% sure it has no spoilers. 
Story - 9. This show was based off of the manga, and the story has a couple flaws, due to it adding another way of life, alchemy. With doing so, it left a few holes unanswered and sometimes contradicted itself, but thats typical. This show doesn't leave too much unanswered, though.
Art - 10. It's a great mix of highly detailed and simplistic.
Sound - 9. I did feel in some
                  episodes that a certain song from its OST didn't fit well with the moment, especially since other songs in the same OST could have done the job better. But then again, it was only in rare occasions, which is why it's a 9 and not an 8.
Characters - 10. If there was an 11, it would have gotten that no problem. The characters are all round characters, and the show, in it's amazing way, makes you feel like you know them, and makes you feel sorry when they undergo a tragedy, and eccentric for them when they feel happy.
Enjoyment - 10. It is hard not to binge watch this series. Not just because of the crazy amount of cliff hangers, but also because you can't get enough of the amazingness it brings.  (Amazingness is not a word. Please do not use it in proper writing). 
Overall - 10. Most of the reasons that I took points off were such minuscule and tiny things that if you are just watching it from an anime fan's point of view, you wouldn't even notice. As someone who has thought himself to notice small things, I couldn't help myself. That being said, this anime deserves to be where it is currently ranking: 2nd place.",10
"
                I watched this show 5 years ago, and until last year it was the only anime show I had ever watched (ofc I had watched a few Ghibli movies too).
Seriously, this is so good that it prevented me from turning into a weeb because other anime that I tried to watch after FMA:B couldn't hold a candle to it. It was only last year that I watched my second anime, OPM (another of my absolute favorites) and my standards took a nosedive due to my excessive amount of free time.
Anyway the point I'm trying to make is that FMA:B tells an unforgettable story. I might
                  need to rewatch it at some point but it's sitting happily in my memory and I'm not sure I want to go through all those emotions again just yet.",10
"
                This is truly a masterpiece. Its true that the first anime adaptation was very good but it doesn't compare with the original (brotherhood). With this in mind let's begin the review and comparison of these two great series. 
The first anime had a very dark story , with the action led by the main characters. It follows the manga up to the half of the story and from there is just filler. What I liked at the first series was the dark tone of the story and the sad ending. I didn't like the fact that Winry personality wasn't truly developed through the series, the
                  fact that we have a small cast of characters and the plot twist at the end. The idea behind the plot twist wasn't bad but it didn't go well with story and it didn't explain exactly the meaning of the gate and of the alchemy. 
The second anime that is an exact adaptation of the manga from the beginning to the end has a much complex story with the action led by the plot. In this remake we have a large cast of characters that are developed better than in the previous series, in the remake Winry is much more down to earth so to speak than in the previous series. In FMA Winry is just about automail but in the FMAB we see that she has feelings for both Elric and Al, especially Elric. I like the end of the remake because it show us the meaning behind the gate and because it is a happy one, and to be honest they deserve a happy ending :D. 
I like both anime series but because the second one has a much better plot  with characters better developed (being based on the manga) the second one goes in my Top 5 and the first one doesn't.",10
"
                FMB is an anime that everyone should watch sometime in their life. The story is amazingly interesting and there is a vast world-building, which is simultaneously innovative and realistic. Therefore, almost every one of the innumerable characters has an interesting history and well-guarded secrets. 
As for the art, it's beautifully fitting with the story and characters and music is a strong part of the overall work. 
It's position is within my top-10 list.

                FMA! I watched Fullmetal alchemist first, thinking brotherhood was a sequel :) well, brotherhood is based of the manga, and I do suggest you watch Fullmetal Alchemist first before viewing FMA:Brotherhood
FMA:Brotherhood is one of those animes that you can easily connect with and manipulates you to the story, drawing you in with its beautiful scenery and storyline before crushing you with its reality! This anime has made my cry bitterly but has also made me nearly fall over laughing! and When I think about it and the memories that it took me through, I can't help but smile.
These characters take you on a journey, and
                  you will feel like you were their personally, experiencing everything by their side!~~",10
"
                When I heard that there was going to be a new FMA anime that followed the manga I was very excited. It followed the original plot well, but the first few episodes were boring since it was basically repeating the events that the original anime shared with the manga. Still, it was nice to see all the little differences. 
After it got to the point where the first anime branched off from the manga thing became more exciting with the new characters, and for a while it was very good. However it seems like the plot was rushed at points, and minor things were cut
                  out all together (mainly most of the humorous parts in the manga). Then at one point it all slowed down so they could wait for the manga to finish before they could end brotherhood, which was very frustrating since there was so many cliffhangers in a row. 
Besides the plot the sound was also very good. The soundtrack is amazing, and I am glad that most of the english voice actors were able to return. However the first couple episodes of the english dub with Al makes your ears bleed. and Hoenheim's new voice actor doesn't fit well.",10

                *Spoilers in the Sound Section*
Having just gotten into the whole of anime recently, I was curious to see why Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the number one rated Anime on MAL. I considered watching the original series first, but ultimately just decided to jump into Brotherhood. While I'm not sure if I made the right choice (Still need to watch the original) I can safely say that this show is one of my favorites. Now, it is not my favorite, however, it was really close to being there. Unfortunately, it does possess some problems that I feel hold it back slightly, so let's jump into my
                  review of FMA: Brotherhood. 
Story: 8
I won't be comparing this to the original, as I have said, I haven't seen it, and from what I've heard, many of the first few episodes are better there. And I noticed the rushed pace, but many of the emotional moments still hit home. A number of character's deaths resonated hard with me. The rushed pace is something I felt fit well with the beginning, as it felt like Ed and Al's search was frantic, as opposed to later, which was slower thanks to having a focused goal. Whether this was intentional or not is something I don't know, but either way, I feel it fit well. The story suffered in that there were often just one too many events occurring. A tiny bit more focus on one scene would've, in my opinion, greatly improved the narrative. Also, I felt that at points, the story was either a tad too confusing (might have been since I didn't watch the original), or a tad too condescending. And those moments dragged me out of the narrative, however, those moments were mainly towards the end, and otherwise, I was left guessing what plot twist would occur, and it made it a hard show to put down
Art: 10
The art in the show is magnificent. From the opening (and we'll get to those opening), to the fight scenes, to the very art style of the show itself, I love it. The animation, when it isn't cutting away to CGI fans (which it does a surprising amount of times in the first part) is slick, sharp, and sweet. The thick lines and great colors were extremely well done. The CGI was mostly well done (I'm pretty sure it's CGI at least, not an expert on that), with the exception of a few small character and object moments. However, that is not enough to detract from undoubtedly one of the most beautiful shows out there,
Sound: 10
Holy cow the sound. It is absolutely amazing. Having some of my favorite openings in Anime history, some very memorable songs from within the show, and some very good audio mixing. There are two places I have major problems with the audio, however, and I know I'm nitpicking here, but honestly, I kinda have to do that with the sound. First, is the moment where Father is climbing up to Truth. He's going on about something, and despite rewatching that scene three times, I can barely make out what he's saying half of the time over the music. Which was annoying on two levels, one, I couldn't hear what might have been a very important diatribe, and I couldn't enjoy the fantastic music. The second moment is when a song didn't fit. When Al and Ed are coming back home, and Winry is coming outside, they play a really depressing song with the Latin Choir and everything, and it really doesn't fit. But other than those two, really annoying, moment the sound is outstanding
Characters: 7
The characters are, well, it's a mixed bag. You have Ed, Al, Mustang, Winry, Hawkeye, Hoenhiem, Armstrong, Ling, Lan Fan, May, Scar, most of the Humunculi, and even Father towards the end, which are all amazing and detailed characters. However, the series suffers due to a way too large side cast. The people of that automail town, most of the police force, all of the higher-ups, the Kameras, the dude who travels with Scar who is so forgettable I don't remember anything about him, despite him being there since part 2, and quite a few others. The shoehorning of these people into the narrative not only weakens it, but also weakens the characters. Development that could've been given to any of the good characters I mentioned was instead given to Lion dude, or what's his face. The strong characters are enough to keep this at a seven, but only a seven. Had just one of them not been executed well, this score would be a five or lower.
Enjoyment/Overall: 9
I'm condensing these two since I'm lazy and feel my enjoyment would be explained in overall either way. I binged this series on Netflix, and it was hard to put down. I would spend hours into the night, that I probably should've been sleeping, watching the show. I feel my enjoyment of the show was only diminished due to the internet. Now admittedly, this is my fault, but in my search for which show to watch first, I was spoiled to quite a few things about the show. That, kinda ruined the suspense at points. But still overall, amazing show, well worth the rating, probably should go watch the 2003 series now.",9
"
                 As an anime person,I think I have watched all the best that this medium could offer,I enjoyed a lot of them,yet,the best I witnessed is not an anime to me.I think nothing I have watched is comparable to Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Why do I mention both series? Well,I cant view them separately,to me FMA and FMAB are one and together they create the greatest work in anime history. Before getting any further I find it necessary to thank the creator,Hiromu Arakawa for just being a genius,because my sloth doesnt let me write another review for the manga alone. Thank You.
 Now
                  to the topic. Fullmetal Alchemist the manga and two anime adaptations are something every one should behold. The story is phenomenal and offers number of philosophical questions,interesting and unique characters,beautiful and realistic world,and a magnificent plot,yet the real beauty of this magic is in the detail and the base of the work. To start off,the world of Fullmetal Alchemist is based on early 20th century world,and the main action is going on in Amestris,which is the counterpart of 20th century Europe. Early 20th century was the darkest period of time for all the world and all the humanity,so this replica is very interesting in itself. And I'm sure everyone already guessed what Ishbal is a reference to. But what is the genius of it,everybody knows that 20th century was the start of the technological and scientific progress that would change the world entirely,so this woman went ahead and put Alchemy as the base concept of the world. Alchemy,from which the roots of science emerge. That is a genius move, and makes the world not only much more greater,but much more deeper also. 
 The characters are the best,everyone has a unique personality,everyone makes their own impact on the development of the story, and everyone themselves are very cautiously developed. All of the characters have their own philosophy,the best example are the Elric Brothers. Edward Elric is my favorite character and is actually the best character in anime. The reason is Nietzsche and his famous work ""Thus spake Zarathustra"". The story of Zarathustra created this ""ubermensch"" concept,which means ""overman"". And here's where Arakawa really shines the brightest, ubermensch is a tricky concept, it has two sides,like Dionysus,it can fool some by making them believe that the ubermensch is the concept of the last man,the one that can have nothing after himself,and is a ""perfect being"". The Last man was Father,who gave up humanity for his own power and his desire to become perfect. But Arakawa gives us the real meaning of ubermensch in the character of Edward Elric, he confronts the negating nature of the last man,and becomes the real ubermensch by giving up power for the sake of love,hope and friendship. He takes a step forward in the evolution of humanity,truly ""overman"" . Edward and Alphonse break the law of equivalent exchange with their ideals. And we have everyone else: Hohenheim,Mustand,Riza,Hughes,Scar and many others,but I'd like to mention the seven deadly sins the most,antagonists like no other,these characters were the  big part why FMA is so great,and greatly depict Dante's comedy,and add yet another great basis to the story. The Truth,or God is another reason for the greatness of this work, I adore the way they managed this character,and the symbolism they used on depicting the meaning of the character.
 One of the best things in Brotherhood is the Homeric atmosphere,which makes the viewer feel like they're reading the Iliad,and all the characters are Greek heroes or Gods and Godesses. The story slowly but surely builds towards the climax,which takes the big chunk of the series,the 20 episode ending is another reason of the comparison to Homer.
 The music is phenomenal,FMA has the best soundtrack in anime,both series shine greatly in this aspect: Brothers,The Atonement,Aisetsu,Beaming Sunlight,The Journey's End,Soldier's Honor,Trisha's Lullaby and many more amazing works sweeten the sound of this great work.
 The animation in it's turn is epic,beautiful,fluent and stunning. Thanks to Studio Bones.
 But the greatest thing of this work is the message of it,the real reason why it's so great is what it leaves for the viewer moving forward, a Fullmetal heart, a belief in humanity, faith and hope. 
Fullmetal Alchemist/ Fullmetal Alchemist Brothehood is the greatest work since Nietzsche and maybe the last great work created by human hand. That's why it's more than anime,it's a work for all and none.",10
"
                The anime is Great! Just a huge masterpiece. You may not need a tissue box since it is not that kind of anime, but hey, it is a very good anime. It's about two boys who's mother died and tried to transmute their mother. The story is good, art is nice, and the characters background is very interesting. I recommend this to any Otaku out there. If you are wondering if there is romance, than there IS romance, but takes some time to develop. I shed some tears at the end because I knew that I would not be seeing more of this amazing anime.
                  Recommend this 9/10!",9
"
                This is the anime that has been hyped up as the godsend. Number 1 on the website. The pinnacle of anime. So of course I was excited to finally get around to this one on my long list. But personally, I don't think it was worth all the hype. I'm not somebody who has seen 500 animes or anything, but I do not see why this has so many 10s across the board.
Slight spoilers ahead
Story: 7
I enjoyed the story. It was entertaining, for the most part. However, I think it dragged at points. For example, the old movie gag of how Yoki met Elric went
                  on waaaaay too long, and took up a decent chunk of the episode. And multiple other points where when the block came up saying it was the commercial, I sat wondering ""really, I felt like it was longer"". Part of that could come from be binge watching and feeling all the episodes blend, but it happened on multiple occasions. What felt like 20 minutes was really 10. It was also a pretty typical story, fighting the big bad who thinks he's god. Didn't really start out that way, but that's what it became later into the story for sure.
Art: 8 
The art was fine, except for the CGI that I honestly thought looked like trash. The biggest culprit being dino Envy. It makes it even worse when it's a scene where the CGI character is paired up across from all the normal animation. It just looks so awkward and out of place. But I did like the thick borders they would do in some action scenes, added weight in my opinion. So the rest of it was spot on, but screw dino Envy.
Sound: 10
No complaints. I thought the sound was fine, the soundtrack played right when it was needed. And the openings and endings, most of them have to end up on my playlist. Good all around. Voice actors were right on the money.
Characters: 7
The goal of getting back the brothers' bodies just seemed weird to me. Not in Alphonse's case, because he actually lost his body. But every time Ed brought up how this was to get ""our"" bodies, I wondered why he included himself. I mean, I understood what he was going for. But I still didn't see a reason for him to be able to group himself with his brother who can't even sleep at night. They were on two ends of the spectrum to me, and it was, I don't know if insulting is the right word, but kind of off that Edward would include himself in the same comparison of losing his body. The same when it would be judged if he were human or not, when it's very clear he is (the same not being able to be said for his brother). This pulled me out of most scenes where these kinds of conversations occurred.
Roy Mustang was an excellent character, and I enjoyed his entire arc. You could really feel the struggles he was going through; I just wish he was around more often.
Some of the side characters felt pretty tacked on, but some were great. For example, the little girl. When danger occurred, it pulled me out of the scene because I knew that nothing bad was really going to happen to her (and if it did, the story would have so much respect from me, not that I wish death on her). However, Scar on the other hand was great for invoking thought, in the characters and in the viewer.
Enjoyment - 7
I was hooked for the first 15-20 episodes. Every episode felt like something going down, something bad. However, I think the show peaked with ""the lighter scene"" to avoid spoilers. Everything after that felt downhill (not to the toilets, but nothing roped me in like my first time seeing that scene). The series seemed like a ton of build up for something big and ended up not being all that much in my opinion. The final fight being more lackluster than would be expected given the circumstances. It was enjoyable, but nothing jaw-droppingly amazing.
Overall- 7
I enjoyed FMA:B. I think it was a good show. However, I do not see the hype in it. It felt like another typical shounen anime. And I like my shounen anime, there is nothing wrong with that for me. But it was not the end all be all anime I expected given its high praise.",7

                *for those people who are too lazy to read, skip to the end*
The big three: Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. You have probably already watched these three anime or they might have even been the ones that got you into anime. Now, what do they have in common? That’s right, they’re all from the shounen genre. Now, the thing is, most of the shounen animes today almost always follow a preset formula in terms of plot, as if they copied it right of an instruction manual. The formula usually goes like: Badass MC appears, Badass MC gains friends, Badass antagonist appears, Badass MC gets his
                  ass handed to him by antagonist, Badass MC gains power-up, Badass MC kicks the antagonist’s ass, then rinse and repeat. If you’ve been paying attention to most of the anime you watch, you’ve probably noticed this already. Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, on the other hand, despite being a shounen anime doesn’t seem to be like this at all, in fact, it is quite the contrary. If so, then how is it different?
 Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which I will just abbreviate to FMA:B,  is different  by the fact that it doesn’t follow that retarded plot formula above. It actually has a well thought-out and gripping plot with a great balance between action and comedy. For starters it doesn’t just go like the regular Going-on-a-adventure or I-need-to-protect-my-nakama shounen type anime. To provide a short summary of the story, it is about Edward and Alphonse Elric. They are two brothers who live in a world wherein a certain type of people called alchemists, people who can transmute anything into something else using a transmutation circle, which is basically a circle which contains a set instruction inside, for as long as it obeys a law called the law of equivalent exchange. Now, the Elric brothers lost their mothers at a young age and decided to try and use alchemy to “transmute” her back to life using ingredients that make up the human body, but unfortunately, a human transmutation is not only prohibited by human laws but by the very laws of god, as a human soul is priceless. So instead of getting back their mother, God took Edward’s arm and Alphonse’s entire body as a toll, and Edward was forced to sacrifice his leg in order to transfix his brother’s soul into a metal body. Not everything is for naught though, because being able to see God and “being dragged through the gates of truth” and living to tell the tale offers a very handsome price: the ability to transmute without the use of a transmutation circle. Then, they proceeded to search for a way to regain their bodies and the solution they found is the Philosopher’s Stone, a legendary object which allows one to disregard the law of equivalent exchange. In their search, they became state alchemists, a group of alchemists who are employed by the state as human weapons. And with that, their adventure begins as they discover the secrets behind the nature of the Philosopher’s Stone.
Well, no, adventure really isn’t the proper word for it. It’s more like chasing rumors to see whether they can find clues to see how to make or where to find a Philosopher’s stone. Now, onto the actual review. The thing that separates FMA:B from other shounen anime is its plot. Unlike other shounen anime that consists of loosely related arcs (think One Piece or Naruto arcs), FMA:B consists of several arcs which are closely related that serves to introduce bits and pieces of the story which at the end will all come together to form one complex plot. This is one of the strong points of FMA:B. The story seems a little slow at the start but once it picks up it really gets going. First it introduces the main points and the basic concepts of the story then proceeds to create conflicts which will keep on adding to the suspense of the story. Now, another thing that sets FMA:B apart from others is the way it answers the questions in the plot. Whenever it raises a question in the viewer’s mind, it usually answers it sometime later, but it also raises another question. This kind of technique makes it so that those who are watching it will always be at the edge of their seat, awaiting the answer to their questions. I know I was at the edge of my seat while watching this, and every time they answer a question and I decide to try and sleep, they leave a cliffhanger at the end which make me want to watch more, and that in itself is a very strong point since it can keep you glued to your seat. Despite this fact, they still manage to answer every question  they raise, leaving no plotholes in the story for as far as I can tell. Another great point of FMA:B is the good balance between the action and comedy. Despite being somewhat serious during the middle and end part of the anime, it still has those moments that can make you laugh and smile, despite the fact that the tension and suspense in the anime is already near its peak. To put it simply, FMA:B knows how to and when to put a good comic relief, and that gives it another point. Still, as with every anime, none of them are perfect. The only thing that I can deem as an imperfection in this anime is the fact that it sort of went overboard during the last 4 or so episodes, only to result in a somewhat anticlimactic defeat of the main antagonist. What do I mean by overboard? Well, to put it simply, it sort of went DBZ with laser beams flying around and that kind of stuff, although it was nothing major, just something I would like to point out. 
Along with a great plot, FMA:B also comes with a great set of characters. To be frank, the character design of the MC character Edward Elric isn’t really all that unique, just your regular noisy kid who firmly believes that killing is bad. This doesn’t mean that he stays that way though, as another one of the great points of this anime if the fact that not only does the characters develop beautifully into fleshed out characters, each with their respective personalities, they also do it smoothly. The anime takes its time to carefully turn them into what they will be, without any sudden developments happening out of thin air(think Sasuke). And here’s something that completely sets it apart from the other animes. The antagonists themselves are developed so well that you actually feel sorry for them. Despite the fact that you will probably hate them at the start of the series due to them being complete assholes most of the time( which is also another good point, since they are antagonists), over time you will come to love them and even feel sad after their deaths. And I don’t mean that they pull a “Severus-Snape-actually being-a-ally” type of sad, antagonist death, I mean that they actually touch your heart during their last moments due to them finally realizing what they truly want. I personally found this as the strongest point of FMA:B, since of all the animes I’ve watched, only in this one did I ever feel a saddened due to the death of an antagonist, wherein in most cases I would just laugh like a maniac due to the horrible fate they suffered. 
And like always, there’s the animation and music. While not being that important, I got to give them props for being thorough with their animation. Unlike some others wherein they just loop a scene of the two people hitting each other, they actually took time to choreograph the fights scenes and the end results are just dazzling. Not only that, you can also see the sheer amount of detail they put especially in things like Edward’s prosthetic arm when Winry is fixing it, and like in Envy’s true form and inside GreedLing’s mind. Of course, the music is just about as good as the art. The OP’s are all catchy, although I wouldn’t have time to describe each of them because there’s a lot of them. Also, the BGM is really something else. The way they match the scene they’re played in is just wonderful. Not to mention, they can also get your blood pumping, as if it’s a BGM in a boss fight scene in a game.
With all of that, I can assure you that Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the best shounen anime during these recent years. I highly recommend watching it and I’m willing to bet my pride that it will not disappoint. Also, unlike other shounen titles, FMA:B is filled to the brim with action and doesn’t tend to drag things out, hence only 64 episode, which is quite short compared to the other, more known titles out there, so why not give it a try? 
To provide a quick summary of the pros and cons:
+Good plot
+Almost all the characters are well-developed, antagonists included
+No plotholes
+Great animation with beautifully choreographed fights
-The last fight at the end was over the top, only to end to the anticlimactic death of the antagonist
-Some of the antagonists are more lovable than the MCs(not really sure if a con or not)
-Nothing else really, except that the sheer number of badass characters in this anime can cause you to get jelly

                I have seen both versions of the Full Metal Alchemist anime, and would a hundred percent say not to waste your time with the other one and to just watch this one.
This version had everything the previous version was lacking and more!
There are many similarities in the beginning of the story to the original, but toward the middle the plot of this one has so much to offer. The character development was paced well and the ending was fantastic.
As a huge fan of the series I'd highly recommend to anyone who wishes to watch.
The story is full of action and humour that will keep you
                  entertained.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a stellar example of how to adapt an already amazing source material into an excellent and sometimes shockingly brilliant anime.
The characters, story and setting are extremely faithful to the manga with a few exceptions in certain places to keep it bellow 100 episodes.
When it comes to its music FMA: B has some of the best for its genre from Happiness to lullaby the ost fits and always draw's a tear for whoever watches.
The anime's use of mature themes also make's this very watchable at any age form Edwards sacrifice to Scar's redemption this show sets an example to watchers to do
                  things for themselves and never give up.",9
"
                Full-metal Alchemist Brotherhood: is a fantastic anime that should be recommend to everyone. It is clear why this is number #1 and it should stay like that. 
The story line untangles the more you experience each episode which allows the show to be re-watchable. You cannot get everything with just one go.
Character development is well thought out and each character feels unique and has a personality. The enemy and the citizens feel unique as well. Personally i felt sympathy for the enemy as their personality has reason and depth.
Music was on-point and was thought-out to fit with scenarios that develop the story as well. It
                  isn't music that was fitted in to fill the emptiness in battle but music to drive emotions into the watcher.
I never felt bored of the series as each episode intrigued me even more and i felt shock after realizing the connections to the story between episodes by the end of each episode. There was never a ""filler episode"" and it was all planned out.
It was never dragged on to force a show and was ended perfectly leaving the person watching wanting another series, but i'm glad there is not because a good story needs a good ending.",10

                Full Metal Alchemist holds a very special place in my heart, as it has been one of my favourites for over 10 years now. Hiromu Arakawa is without a doubt one of the most talented, inspirational artists in the manga field; her story telling abilities are just as amazing as her drawing skills. It was an absolute joy seeing such a compelling manga series get not one, but TWO anime adaptations. The original FMA series released in 2003 was brilliant, but then Brotherhood came along and made everything ten times better.
Brotherhood is much more faithful to the manga story line; it introduces a bunch of
                  new characters, such as May Chang, Ling Yao and his two bodyguards who never made it into the first series. There are also no filler episodes, which can get on my nerves with any popular, long running franchises. The pacing is far quicker compared to the 2003 series - certain events that took up two or three episodes in the first adaptation are now condensed into a single episode. The main plot is so epic anyway that there quite simply isn't room for any side stories. It will have you hooked from the beginning - the more you get into it, the harder it will be to stop watching because you get the urge to find out what happens next. 
The animation is among the best I've ever seen in an anime series - the character designs have improved significantly since 2003 and the settings are absolutely gorgeous, especially Fort Briggs which is surrounded by snow capped mountains. The numerous alchemy sequences are captured amazingly well, from the metallic chime that sounds when Edward claps his hands to the lightning effects that occur when the alchemy is being performed. 
All of the opening and ending themes are a delight to watch and listen to; most of them are really catchy after a few listens! The various instrumental pieces scattered throughout the episodes succeed in creating the perfect mood for specific scenes, whether they're action packed, suspenseful or tugging on the heart strings.
I admit that I've not seen very much of the Japanese audio with subtitles. It's not that I don't think it's good, it's just that the English dub is so good that I forget to give the Japanese a chance! Nearly every member of the original FMA cast reprised their roles in the English dub, and boy do they deliver! They really did a fantastic job of bringing the characters to life; I couldn't fault any of the performances.
One thing that I admire about Hiromu Arakawa is that she has a great ability to create lovable, genuinely interesting characters that all have a purpose in the series - none of them are thrown in just for the sake of it. They'll stay with you long after you've finished the story - especially the Elric brothers as their unbreakable bond had a very profound effect on me.
To summarise, Brotherhood is an absolute gem of a series that ticks all the right boxes - it's got plenty of action, thought provoking topics and heart breaking moments. An instant classic that surely belongs in every anime fan's collection.",10
"
                This anime is actually my #1 favourite anime. It's just so amazing. I watched this anime 3 times and it just gets better! It's one of those anime that just grip you into the story and make you want to watch the next episode. There are no flaws AT ALL in this anime. There will never be an anime out there that will be better than this.
Everything is just so original! The plot, characters, the art and so much more! The animation is just so fluent and beautiful. The fight scenes are fantastic! Don't expect a lot of action from this series as it only
                  focuses more on on the characters and story than it does on the action. But the action scenes are still very well made and animated.
When I watched this anime it went so quick and it just felt like I watched an amazing movie! This anime has a great amount of episodes. No too short, not too long and it won't waste your time. Overall I'd give this anime a 10 out of 10. 5 starts out of 5. It is a phenomenal anime. Any anime lover should definitely check this out if they haven't already. Because trust me, you will not be disappointed. You will be glad you watched this.",10

                No anime watcher can ever go through the anime world having missed this one. FMA: Brotherhood: a true work of art.
Story: 9.5/10
Pros: The plot of FMAB will always strike me with my admiration. So many twists and turns it’s unbelievable. By the end of every episode, it kept me wanting more and more. And guess what: I got the “more” I wanted!
Cons: Fast paced at the start, perhaps overwhelming to an FMA newbie. A pointless arc around episodes 8 and 9, however I am just being nitpicky at this point.
Art: 10/10
Pros: Perfection on the art. What can I say
Cons: NA
Sound/Music: 10/10
Pros: Great music, always setting the correct mood during the scenes.
Cons: NA
Characters: 9/10
Pros: So many characters however so well developed and depicted in this anime. There was so much likeableness about nearly every character, and that also helped with keeping track of their names and sides they were on. I loved how there were so many divisions of “good guys and bad guys” desiring different things for different purposes.
Cons: The only problem that I had was the side humor. It may be just me but I honestly thought their was too much humor among the characters in dark parts of the show. The characters shouldn’t have thrown in humor at inappropriate times. Once again, I am being a stickler.
Overall: 9.5/10
If you haven’t been absolutely amazed by FMA: Brotherhood, you simply haven’t seen it.",9
"
                Greatest fighting shonen of all time. The story was great, the main protagonist is not the typical 'dreamer' of other shonen. He made a mistake and now he wants a redemption. 
The plot continuity was excellent. I have to point out that there's no 'Diavulus ex Machina' in the shows, in other words, random enemies or problems appear in order to continue the history. 
The secondary characters and the protagonist are the MVP's of the show (main mention to Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Scar and Greed).
Of course, the show is not perfect. It has some issues that I'm not gonna tell to avoid spoilers, and,
                  despite that, the show had a awesome ending keeping quality's consistency and closing correctly the character's arcs. The anime/manga writers and shonen fans should have this one as a reference of a quality fighting shonen.",9
"
                To me, this anime is simply amazing. The best I've ever seen. Of course, I realize that I may be biased, as I've been a very big fan of the FMA manga for a long time now, but this series was such a faithful adaptation of the manga that I think it shows how well-crafted of a story Arakawa created in Fullmetal Alchemist.
To me, Fullmetal has always been a favorite because of its characters. Every single character is three-dimensional, meaning they have many different facets to their personalities; I really felt for these characters. The characters are all very likeable, and it is wonderful to
                  watch them grow and develop throughout the series. Peoples' motivations, perceptions, etc can change, and that's what keeps the story interesting. I feel the core of this story is centered around the characters, and I think this series is best described firstly as a drama, then as action or adventure. Without me spoiling anything, I can assure readers of this that the plot and character development in Fullmetal is truly top-notch. The concept of Equivalent Exchange is discussed in the series too, and is a reoccurring theme. Taking this and its characters into account, Fullmetal Alchemist is more than just an excellent military-suspense-action show: it's a story about life and what it is worth to people.
I especially liked the art style of this series- it was very very reminiscent of the manga. The show utilizes softer lines and a more muted, but still bright when needed, color palette. Some scenes in the show I swear looked as if the animators took specific panels out of the manga and relayed it on screen. A real treat for a fan of the original work like myself. I appreciated the attention to detail that catered to the already existing fanbase.
The action scenes are in my opinion very well done here. They are choreographed very well, and the suspense that is built up is fantastic.
The music in the series I thought was overall very good. I enjoyed all of the opening themes, especially the second one. The background music was nicely orchestrated and matched the scenes onscreen. Some of the endings were not memorable to me, but that's not uncommon in shows as long as this one.
In conclusion, for me this is an absolute must-see for any anime fan. Heck, I would try to recommend it to people who are not anime fans. The story is that well put together. I found myself rooting and yearning for the brothers' success so much this story- it's hard not to. Please take a look at this series- you'll be glad you did.
P.S. Although I watched the entire series with Japanese audio, I have also seen some episodes with the English dub, and I am extremely impressed with it. I prefer to watch dubs most of the time, and Fullmetal so far has done an excellent job with their English dub.",10

                This anime is one of the best anime i have ever seen.
Everything about this season is better then the first, from the characters to the story all of it i loved (And the ending rapped things up perfectly).
Anyone how hasn't seen this must watch it now.
(of course the best parts come after the beginning 13 or so episodes which quickly rap up the first half of the first season. if you've watched the first season you could just skip to then).

                NON-SPOILERY REVIEW:
I haven't read the manga nor have seen the original FMA.I started watching the first episode of FMA: B, telling myself that this would be a letdown, that it's just a full-on action anime(which I don't really enjoy a lot).The first episode was alright. It made me read a lot about real world alchemy practices, that led me into watching the 2nd ep.
I got hooked after watching the 2nd ep and thus my binge had begun.
I had watched the entire anime within 2 weeks (college is a pain).
The MCs are 2 brothers who just want their lost bodies back. The plot's simple right? Wrong.
                  One thing leads to another and it just goes on, revealing bigger things in motion.
The music is truly wonderful. The characters feel very real and true.,especially the supporting cast. The later additions to the cast like General Armstrong and Kimblee are one of my favorites.
This anime has something for everyone. It's  action-y, comic, tragic.
Actually had me holding my tears at 2-3 scenes.
I would give it a 9.5/10. I recommend this to anyone who hasn't already watched this and is looking for some anime with really cool characters.",10
"
                In my opinion, this is the greatest anime every produced. Everything here falls into place to create a sweeping story that transcends time and emotion. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood takes the story of the original manga and put it in motion for all to enjoy.
Story: 10/10
The story of Brotherhood couldn't be more simple: two brothers try to get back what they lost due to their own selfishness. But unbeknownst to them, a plot is set in motion that could alter the face of the world. The duo have to overcome obstacle after obstacle to uncover the truth of the country of Amestris. Nothing is wasted through
                  each scene and setting. Besides the first episode, which is mostly just an introduction of the major characters, there are no filler arcs or pointless story beats throughout the entire 64 episodes. If I had only one gripe, it was that some chapters of the manga, especially near the beginning, while present in the 2003 adaptation, never had a chance to be presented here.
Art: 10/10
The art and animation is fluid and beautiful from start to finish. From fiery explosions to breathtaking sceneries, each frame is astonishingly beautiful to observe. Character details are vivid and are expressive to the fullest amount. Comedic moments (which are plentiful) are drawn in a way that expresses hilarity and are used strategically to heighten those comedic moments. The art and animation could not have been more spot on and still looks amazing almost 10 years later.
Sound: 10/10
The music. The sound mixing and editing. The voice acting. All perfection. Each track of music is placed at a scene that most accentuates the emotion the viewer is supposed to feel. The placement of key sounds and background noise is set perfectly into place to immerse you into the world. Enough credit cannot be given to the voice acting of each character in both Japanese and English, especially Vic Mignogna. He lives and breathes Edward Elric, and nothing can take that away from him.
Character: 10/10
Even with the abundance of dozens upon dozens of main characters, each one has their own personality and characteristics that let them shine in their own way. The character interactions seem genuine and sincere, which is in part due to the terrific voice acting. The development of some characters can be seen through all 64 episodes, leading to some interesting twists and heartbreaking farewells. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
As I said, this is the greatest anime of all time to me. The characters are intriguing and endearing to a fault. The worldbuilding and setting design are fully expressed so as not to overcomplicate things for the viewer. The story is coherent and builds with each passing episode. The sound design is perfect and Vic Mignogna is the MVP. This show should be on the Mount Rushmore of anime series, and rightfully so.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a masterpiece.
I've watched this show across the span of 8 months. A very bad decision on my part. But the fact that I watched every episode, or every few episodes, in a very well-organized (not really) manner gave me a more in-depth analysis to the series. The values of family, love, death and power. Understanding these and how they were portrayed in the show is what it means to understand Fullmetal. Slight spoilers ahead though.
I must clarify this first: I haven't read the manga, nor have seen the 2003 FMA. I entered this show with confidence that it was good, mostly
                  because of it's #1 on MAL, and because of the other reviews I've read. And I can wholeheartedly say that this is one of the best shows I've seen. From start to finish, from the worst battle-scene to the best, from the more inaccurate to the pin-point story telling, FMA:B does not fail to surprise you. Even in the less well produced parts of the show, it sparks compared to other shounen. 
Sound and animation are very different from the usual anime style we see everywhere. The intros and endings really accompany the contents of the episode very well. I caught myself casually watching the intro, the episode itself and the ending without being bored, or without ever having a need to skip the intro and the ending. The music and the animation flow very well with how the story is told: fast-paced, in-depth and, of course, in the best way possible. At first, I didn't like how the characters were drawn. I was so used to the main way characters were drawn in mainstream anime that I was taken aback by this new way of drawing characters. But somehow, this also fits in with the show! It's amazing how a series can be so different from the norm, yet so good.
I found myself captivated by the plot of the show. In the first few episodes, everything goes smoothly: plans are being laid out, the main characters discover more and more about their objective and antagonists are laid out one by one. As soon as the Briggs Arc passes, everything goes into full action mode. Suddenly, old characters mentioned in the first episodes become main points of interest. New characters arrive at the aid of the protagonists. The battles become harder and harder, with new waves of brand-new enemies that are ready to destroy everything in their way. With all the info gathered across the episodes, the main characters go into battle with the antagonist, with the slight hope of defeating him, while also following their main objective. Of course, in the end the antagonist loses. Even if it's very generic, his defeat was greatly executed. And so, the protagonist arrive at their objective, and return to their home, where a certain special character awaits them. It's a great story really; I've come across shows that try their best to reach a story like this one, but fail in doing an outstanding job like FMA:B did.
Now, the characters. Oh, the characters... My weakness. In short, they are where FMA:B shines at its best. The main protagonists, Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric are amazing. With a simple objective at hand, they follow the path of justice to obtain their dream. Wait, isn't this a very simple characters build? Haven't we seen Kirito, from SAO, that always follows his objective, while being as close to righteousness as possible? How are two brothers with missing limbs (and one of them missing his whole body) able to compete with Kirito, if they are so similar in character? You're already missing the point. You don't compare Edward Elric's sense of justice and intelligence with one of a guy's trapped in virtual reality. It's incomparable. To me, Edward Elric's character is above most of the protagonists' out there. He easily connects with a certain, possibly evil character. He understands the character. And he acts upon the character as is best. This quote struck me a bit, but in one of his discussions with a ""villain"", Greed, the villain told him something like this: ""'I want to see someone who has died', 'I want money', 'I want women' and 'I want to defend the world' are all things that the heart wants, or in other words, desires. If I had to say, greed is neither good nor bad. You humans get tripped up because you presume to assign value ratings to greed."" And Ed said nothing. He felt guilt because of a scene before this discussion, and met Greed in the hallway. Even if there was no discussion needed, Ed still responded until this remark. Because Greed is right. There is no good or bad in greed, and even a villain named after such sin knows this. There was no need for this discussion to be shown, yet it still was. And this is just one of the best examples of how the characters are built and how in-depth the story actually is. I can also talk about Mustang's greed, Envy's reason, Pride's shame and so on. That's why the characters are so much more different than others. You can't simply compare Alphonse's character with, let's say, Leorio's character, a very good main from Hunter x Hunter. Not because one of them is better than the other, but simply because they're both that good.

I guess now it's pretty easy to see why I've enjoyed Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood so much. It's different and it does very well in that category. I'm very thankful for coming across such a good show, and I hope those who've read my review until now will also watch the show, and possibly enjoy it as much as I did.",10
"
                I'm going to leave my feedback mainly for readers that are hesitant about starting this anime. It'll be spoiler free and ill try to keep it short.
My experience with brotherhood is that it took me three attempts to actually sit down and watch the show in a span of 2,5 years. The third time was the one that I went in with the mindset. ""I'm sure there's great reason as to why many people love this show , so i'll try to move past what originally set me off about it"".
..And there were two things in particular that I couldn't stand at the beginning. The
                  horrible pacing and the quantity of very bad childish gags, with the reason , from what I assume to break tension, but they were even used at random points making it just TOO much. 
Despite all that , both of my complains were tackled pretty early on , probably from somewhere around episode 8 till the very end of the anime. The pacing and story telling of this anime was consistent, those that I referred to as chilidish gags earlier now were delivered far less and only on the correct moments. From then on slowly and steadily the plot became more mysterious and engaging , bringing interesting characters with cool designs and personalities and before I even realized it I was hooked.
For other positives: for the japanese version , there are some amazing voice actors in there. The soundtracks are an actual masterpiece , each placed perfectly at the best moment and the animation was surprisingly consistent and very well made from episode 1
My overall feelings for this anime is that. It may have perhaps failed to get me emotionally invested in the characters in the caring way, but it has absolutely nailed the coffin on making me like and be interested about almost all of them, and the cast of characters is really large.
To recap, the strong points of the show are several. Characters and their development , the pacing of and the contents of the story itself, OST and sounds, animation , facial expressions and artwork.
Give it a shot, i don't think you'll regret it.",8
"
                The animation in FMA Brotherhood is crisp and very well done (although it does sometimes dip a bit in quality). Compared to the original FMA it's a bit simpler but that's just because the original set a very high standard to follow. The facial emotions of the characters are also perfectly presented. The action scenes are brilliant and VERY well animated, with a variety of alchemy techniques and other talents being displayed nearly every episode. The various battles are consistently exciting to watch, but somehow get even better towards the end of the series.
The voice acting is of an excellent and consistent quality, and I
                  think that pretty much all the characters have voice actors which suit their personalities. The majority of the openings/endings are a pleasure to watch due to fantastic animated sequences and theme songs. The background music which play during the episodes usually fit very well with the situation, although some tracks seem to be overused a little at first. This becomes less of a problem as the series progresses, with plenty of new music being introduced to support the story as it reaches the finale.
Moving on to the characters (best thing about this series), the original FMA focussed mainly on Ed and Al and on their struggles to regain their bodies, whereas Brotherhood also explores other characters to great detail at the same time. The majority of the spotlight is still on the two brothers, but it highlights their interactions with new characters which were not present in the original anime. New characters include a group of people from Xing (a neighbouring country), another person from the Armstrong family (who I think has become one of the coolest members of the supporting cast), and a new main antagonist. For me, the Xingese characters in particular (Ling Yao and Mei Chang among others) provide a new dimension to the FMA world, by showing us a different culture to the militaristic one we're familiar with. I think the new antagonist is an improvement on the original FMA, as this person has a much stronger and clever link to the Elric brothers' father. Returning characters from the original FMA, such as Mustang and Scar, are much more awesome and developed due to the fact that Brotherhood is 100% faithful to the manga. Plus, Winry Rockbell now has a much more active role in the story. I can say for sure that this anime has one of the best main/supporting casts I've ever seen, and you'd probably find it difficult to label any of the recurring characters (whether they are good or evil) as being either boring or unnecessary in terms of the storyline.
One of the many good things about this series is that there has been absolutely no filler at all (yes, I'm thinking of Naruto, Inuyasha, etc), which prevents the story from losing momentum. All the episodes are concise and every scene is important as part of the huge plot. The dialogue fully explains everything and is straight to the point. As multiple characters are explored there are lots of side stories, but these are all perfectly intertwined with the main story of the Elric brothers and more often than not directly influence their journey too. Like most anime series, there are things from the manga which have been left out, but these are usually just restricted to comedy moments. There has been one episode which shows a lot of flashbacks of events so far, but that's forgiven as it shows the most epic moments of the series, and also provided us with some history on the father of the Elric brothers. 
FMA Brotherhood will be sorely missed now that it's finished. It is excellent in every aspect and has very little, if anything, that can be called a flaw (maybe rushed character development at first due to the fast pacing, but this quickly subsides). Each episode feels like it's too short, a testimony to how much it draws you in to the story and characters. There are moments which leave you smiling, laughing, sad and simply amazed. Try this anime, it's recommended for absolutely everyone, to newcomers and to those familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist.",10

                Warning possible Spoilers
For a long time I've been looking for that anime that would truly blow me away and after watching 64 amazing episodes I have finally found that anime
The story is about Edward and Alphonse Elric who had an accident with Human Transmutation when they were kids which ended up costing them dearly, now as state alchemists they have set out on a journey to get back their bodies.
The story was absolutely amazing, it had very well done pacing I never once got bored or uninterested because once the situation started to settle a bit it just blew me away with a plot twist
                  and this how has so many plot twists my brain couldn't take it, it was that good. It was very interesting seeing how Alchemy worked and what you should or shouldn't do with it like when Ed and Al tried to use Human Transmutation to bring back their mother which led to them almost losing their lives with Ed losing his left leg and right arm while Al lost his entire body and his soul had to be put into a suit of armour just to stay alive. Watching the journey the Elric brothers had to take was exciting and the amount of effort and sacrifice they had to make made you want them to succeed in their quest to get back their bodies, It's been a long time since I have watched an anime that has completely satisfied me like this one.
The characters were done so amazingly well hell even the villains were done well and that is quite a rare site for me.
I loved the chemistry between the Elric brothers they would always watch each others backs and had a lot of morals meaning they wouldn't stoop to levels that involved murder to get back their bodies so you would respect these characters decisions most of the time, Ed has a temper especially when people call him short and his reactions were always hilarious while Al is more kind and level headed than Ed and thinks more with his brain than his fists, both brothers are fiercely protective of their friends and even random people they meet on their adventures showing the good hearts they have.
There is a huge amount of characters in this show and there are some who really do stand out like Roy Mustang who is a fire alchemist and he along with many other characters is a troubled soul from his actions in the Ishvalan civil war and he sets out to become the new fuhrer to change things so he is a very honorable person and a badass too from his fights with Lust and Envy where he completely annihilated them, but he is a caring leader and cares for his friends and the soldiers under his command.
Riza Hawkeye is a marksman among the alchemists and is Roy's most trusted subordinate and both of them do have a close relationship, Riza is a strict, but kind woman and is willing to do whatever it takes to protect the people she cares about.
Winry Rockbell is the childhood friend of both Ed and Al, she was the one who created Ed's metal arm and leg so he can move around and do his alchemist business, she cares alot for Ed and Al since they are family to her considering her parents died, although she does have a temper much like Ed which is definitely shown when they end up surviving deadly battles.
The Armstrong Duo Alex and Mira are strong and respectful soldiers who are willing to put their lives on the line to protect their soldiers, but they are a little different Alex is more soft-hearted while Mira is tough and is a force to  be reckoned with.
Ling Yao is a prince from Xing who is trying to find the secrets of immortality to save his clan and become emperor, despite being a bit clumsy he is very skilled at combat and believes the most important thing is the people around him.
Lan Fan and Old Man Fu are Ling's bodyguards who accompany him to Central, they are fiercely loyal to Ling and use a wide array of weapons to defeat their opponents.
May Chang is another character from Xing searching for immortality to save her clan except she is very intelligent, very skillful at martial arts and knows the art of Alkahestry, she can also be an adorable character when she interacts with Alphonse since she develops a crush on him, she also has her Panda Shao may who is an adorable sidekick for May since she mimics her actions and has very funny reactions to certain things.
Mae Hughes is a Lieutenant Colonel, a family man and a friend of Roy Mustang, he is a very funny person often exclaiming jokes with his friends.
Izumi Curtis is the one who teached Ed and Al how to use Alchemy and ended up having the same fate as them in the past, she is a tough woman and shouldn't be underestimated in a fight.
Van Hohenheim is the father of Ed and Al, he is a very troubled person and is actually immortal so he left the Elric brothers so can find a way to be mortal and be a father to them until his enemy the Homunculus made him concentrate on other things.
Then there is Scar a survivor of the Ishval civil war who is looking for revenge, but over the course of the show he does see the error of his ways and builds a new found respect for the people he meets and fights with.
There are a lot of villains in this show which are named after the Seven Deadly Sins and they are all difficult to kill since they have regenerative powers except King Bradley who ages like a normal human, they were all created by the Homunculus or Father as they call him who wants to consume God so he can rule the world with his powers.
The Artstyle for this anime was done very well the powers that the alchemists used were impressive, destructive and were all different which was nice seeing the different variety of powers each alchemist had, the locations where the show was set were pretty cool like from the cold mountains on the Dachma border to the boiling deserts that separate Central and Xing to the nice countryside of the Elric brothers hometown.
The action was done brilliantly the battles were really entertaining to watch ranging from gunfights to alchemy battles there was a lot of destructive and it was really interesting seeing how the good guys would beat the bad guys like when Ed and Ling were sucked into Gluttony's belly and had to figure a way out or when they would fight to the near point of death and you would wonder how they would get out of this situations.
There is also a lot moments where there is comedy and it was done brilliantly because the jokes that were around in the show didn't wear out like when Ed keeps being called short or when they anger someone like Izumi, Winry or Mira, it was very funny, but that doesn't say it has it's sad moments because people do die like Hughes and lust who in my opinion were killed off too early and the eventual moment Ed returns Al to the real world was tear jerking scene.
Overall I absolutely loved this series and is something every anime fan should watch because it is amazing, full of brilliant characters, epic battles and more plot twists than you can imagine you'll certainly have a wonderful adventure watching this anime.",10

                FMA:B is the kind of anime that when you finish it you just lean back for like a minute and think ""oh. it's over."" and then you feel really really sad because the whole thing is just OVER. It's like when you finished Deathly Hallows and just felt suddenly awful because the story of Harry Potter is DONE. THAT'S how good FMA:B is. it's the kind of anime you never want to end. The universe is fantastically crafted, and every character is unique and interesting. I mean how many other animes have a main character that's an empty suit of armor (the other FMA anime
                  doesnt count)? The character development is great. The story is top notch, far superior to the first FMA.
Final word: FMA:B is required viewing for everyone who watches anime. And i HIGHLY reccomend the dub. it's great, doesn't have any awkward translations, and helps with the ""european"" setting.
10/10",10
"
                I would not recommend people watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (FMAB) as their first show unless they want every other show out there (aside from a few notable exceptions) to leave a painfully average taste.
The Plot:
FMAB has a plot that at first seems pretty generic albeit interesting. The concept of alchemy is introduced very well and continuously explained well throughout the show. At no point during the show was I confused about the weird magic sorcery they were doing. The entire concept of alchemy is also very elegant and easy to comprehend. FMAB sets rules and the world abides by those rules. However throughout the show
                  the plot develops from the brothers simple journey to a conflict that puts at stake the population of an entire country and the potential creation of a god. The way the story develops is wonderful and watching it put the main brothers in morally conflicting situations really helps you to create a bond with the protagonists and enjoy watching them grow.
The Characters:
The FMAB characters are extremely solid and well rounded with some incredible examples like Hohenheim and Greed. There are very few main characters that feel bland or boring with each addition being somewhat unique and having their own additional quirks, personalities, morals and problems. The homunculi vary in quality from some absolute masterpieces such as envy and greed to some questionable characters such as lust and sloth. In total the characters of FMAB won't be on the same level as Lelouch from Code Geass but won't disappoint either.
Sound and Animation:
Bones put a lot of effort and money into making the animation good and it really stands out. The entire show comes to life and fight scenes never disappoint. The openings and endings are also all of a high quality with certain tracks such as Uso, Rain and Again being some of the best themes in anime. The OST's are also incredibly memorable and really bring the show to life and help elicit emotional responses from the viewer, whether that be hype at an awesome battle or tears at an emotional moment. The music and animation in this show is stellar.
Enjoyment:
FMAB is (to date) my second favorite anime of all time, only beaten out by Steins Gate and closely followed by Code Geass. Its incredibly enjoyable and I was never bored whilst watching. If anything the only problem with the show is that due to the lack of low points the high points feel less high which is hardly the shows fault. I believe this anime to be one of the best out there and if you watch I'm sure you'd be of similar opinion.
Problems:
There really aren't that many issues with the show. Since its so solid its hard to point out any consistent because quite frankly they aren't there. I've watched the show twice (I don't rewatch shows regularly) and even on my second run through I didn't notice any ground breaking flaws in logic, plot animation or character design. If anything the only issue with the show is that it can take a while to pick up steam but that's part of the deal when you begin watching a 60+ episode show and the wait is definitely worth it. The only this stopping FMAB from being a 10 is that it doesn't do enough extra. That may sound contradictory to everything I've said in this review so allow me to explain. Everything FMAB does is done to near perfection however what it lacks is that extra level of depth. Its a good show, but that's all it is, a show. Unlike something such as the ending of Code Geass which really made me reconsider certain aspects of life. But then again this final point will come down to opinion as people connect to different things differently. 
Conclusion:
Watch this show. Don't push it back. Watch it. You won't regret it.",9
"
                I just finished FMA:B and when it ended, the first thing I thought was ""wow, this is actually a masterpiece"". I never knew it was #1 on myanimelist. In fact, the reason I joined myanimelist was because of this anime. It's just so good, I had to read dozens of reviews because I just couldn't accept the fact that it ended.
Story: There are people who've said it wasn't that original, but it is. Just because an anime, FMA:B for example, doesn't go over the top, does not mean it is not original. It is sweet and simple, but at the same time, absolutely mindblowing. The
                  author really knows how to control the story to not make it sound too cliche or mediocre. Edgy? Not really. It's understandable why some characters acted out the way they did.
Art: It's clean, detailed, and can still be considered top-level animation now. The style really draws you in. I can see the hard work put into this anime, and the fighting scenes can really blow you away. 
Sound: No problem about that. Perfectly audible. Love Alphonse's voice. 
Character: I'm just gonna say this, I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE CHARACTERS IN FMA:B. My favourite is Olivier, Scar, Izumi, Alphonse, Hohenheim... sorry I got carried away. There are really outstanding characters that range from badass to cute. I bet you'll even find yourself loving the enemies. I love Envy btw. 
Enjoyment: I literally binge-watched this, and now that i'm left with nothing after finishing it, I try to find something else that can entertain me like FMA:B can, but I still miss it a lot, so i'm thinking of re-watching it. I'm not really a re-watcher, but FMA:B is an exception. So let's just say it gets you completely glued to your screen. There was one time I watched FMA:B all day, and I told my friend ""today felt like... an episode of FMA:B."" 
Overall: One in a million.",10

                I usually dislike most works that deal with magic (or pseudo magic-by-another-name). Magic in most works is a totally inconsistent force wherein the rules seem ever-changing at the convenience of the plot, and this inconsistency really annoys me. This bias kept me away from this show for awhile, but I am happy to say that alchemy is different. Alchemy here is bound by a single consistent-throughout rule (the law of equivalent exchange). 
This consistency may be the Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood's greatest strength. The show abides by the rules it sets throughout, the characters always feel grounded in who they have been established to be,
                  and no other factors ever feel compromised for the purpose of forcing the plot in a direction it could not naturally flow.
The plot is great and unique. At times it can feel confusing as they show maintains a steady pace and only offers information and explanation as it is needed which helps keep it feeling balanced and never overwhelming. By the end the story feels clear, encompassing and concise. No loose ends come to mind and the show never feels like a rip-off or redesign of another work.
The characters at play here are fantastic to the extent it is easy to say even some of the side characters are better than the main characters of other works. They all feel rounded, have their own motivations and inspirations, and suffer their own flaws. Ed and A, while considered prodigies within the alchemist community for their skill to age relativity, are not obnoxiously powerful which is refreshing to see in protagonists. They consistently meet and face off against other far more powerful than they are which creates a necessity for them to outsmart their enemies, find solutions other than violence, and rely on others for aid and support. It's nice to see a show where protagonists can't just suddenly power-up to change the rules of conflict and overpower their enemies. Among all the characters, no one is too powerful to die which is also refreshing. In numerous shows a whole list of characters are made death-proof, but not here. Any and all can die and many do. Lastly regarding the characters, the show does great displays a loyalty to them. No one is forgotten and the ending offers farewells to all.
The art, the music, the writing. Everything here comes together to create a truly enjoyable experience.  I could dig deep into each aspect, discuss specific scenes, and hold long conversations regarding this show. To any on the fence, this is truly a masterpiece worthy of the time investment.",10

                ""Despair to those who become boastful.""
The King of Shounen. 
Simple as.
  Meticulously crafted universe, on par in complexity with Game of Thrones, multi-threaded storyline, with individual branches intertwined with each other and the main plot, limitless supply of memorable moments, a captivating, beautiful orchestral soundtrack.
  Brotherhood, political plotting, espionage, inhuman experimentation, pointless wars in distant lands, ancient celestial beings, supernatural powers, adventure, suffering, subtle romance (Royai otp,) being challenged by the Universe itself. This shit has it all.
 A grandeur journey, an adventure scaling from fighting over a glass of milk all the way up to killing Gods.
 Perfect introduction to anime for
                  someone who hasn't tried any.",10
"
                I heard that this anime was the G.O.A.T. Once you watch it, you will understnad. FMAB totally deserves all the praise it can get and rightlfully earned the right to be the top anime of all time. And to say this is a ""masterpiece"" is majorly understating it. This is perfection beyond perfection. Like once you've achieved something this great, it's hard to be beaten.
The anime is filled to the brim with emotions, from laughter to anger to sadness and everything in between. The story telling was impeccable, and the background music takes it to a whole 'nother level. I especially liked how all the
                  characters were given roughly equal screen time, so you get an ample taste of everyone. 
Let me honest here. I actually cried SEVERAL times throughout the anime because I was so emotionally attached to it. It might not sound like a big deal, but I'm not one to get emotional usually. 
All in all, I would HIGHLY recommend EVERYONE regardless if you like anime or not to watch this.",10
"
                The philosophical depth in this show is astounding. It follows three different philosophical theories. The theory of Psychological egoism (Ring of Gyges story) by Glaucon (Plato's brother), The Teleological Suspension of the Ethical (Kierkegaard) and Plato's Forms. 
The art is amazing, specifically the use of pointillism to outline the character ""Truth"" in an otherwise plain world of forms where only ideas exist. 
The emotion that the final season in particular brings out, can leave the viewer needing water as they ugly cry. 
Ed and Alphonse have a great brotherly relationship, as part of themselves is still stuck in the portal of truth, the show does
                  a great job of showing us how their lives are intertwined. Without spoiling the show, Ed and Alphonse need each other in the end more than you can know.
10/10 anime, even better ranked than my favorite anime Naruto.",10

                Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, is a story about two brothers, going on a journey to try to recover what they'e had lost, while meeting new friends, allies, but also enemies. In a world that revolves around Alchemy.
The story starts with the Elric family, the two brothers, older brother Edward and younger brother Al, and their mother. While the father has left home for a long while. 
Despite the absence of their father the brothers live a happy live with their mother and their childhood friend Winry. All while having taken a interest for the Alchemic arts and studying their dad's Alchemy books.
When their mother dies
                  due to a illness, the boys decide to bring their mother back to live with Alchemy. What seemed to be innocent childrens wish to see their dear mother one last time, turned out to be the brother's biggest mistake... and the beginning of their difficult journey, to regain what they have once lost.
FMA: Brotherhood isn't to be confused with the FMA anime that came before it. The FMA: Brotherhood anime follows the storyline of the manga. 
While the first FMA series seems to have a original storyline which is completely different from the Brotherhood storyline. Though the beginning and the motive for the brothers their journey is still the same.
You can watch both FMA series if you'd like, but in my personal opinion i prefer and enjoyed the Brotherhood series more. But that doesn't mean the previous FMA serie is a bad anime, it's just different.
And basicly, you can watch the FMA: Brotherhood anime and follow the storyline easily, even if you didn't watch the former FMA series that came before Brotherhood.
Now, about my ratings for this anime;
Story 10:
The story is well written, as you watch the anime, you notice just how good everything that happens eventually fits together like a puzzle. Also, the story has, action, drama, comedy, shocking moments, conspiracies, and a bit of subtle romance i think.
Ofcourse the brothers play the main parts and you will see them wrestling with past regrets, and their current hardships, but also their happy moments and succes. 
Al while supporting each other and as they go on their journey they'll meet new friends and allies who help them in their quest. I enjoyed it. 
And like with most other shounen anime, friendship plays a part aswell.
Art 10:
Not much to say about this really, just that i liked the art style of the serie and the characters.
Sound 9: 
The only reason i gave this a 9, is because i didn't like al the opening theme's of the anime, but that's just a matter of taste. The voice acting was good, and nothing wrong or bad about it in my opinion.
Character 10: 
Besides the two Elric brothers, the cast exist of many other fun, cool and enjoyable charcters who shine in their own right, not being put in the background by the main characters.
The rest of the cast, have their own past, regrets, sorrows, goals and joys you'll get to know about throughout the serie, although with some charcters more than with others.
Enjoyment 10:
Like i mentioned before, i enjoyed this anime, so much that i'v watched it twice now, mostly because i really liked the ending. If you're curious about this anime, you should give it a try, i recommend this anime.
Overall 10:
Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, is a good anime, with enjoyable charcaters, a very well written storyline, good voice-acting and soundtrack, good looking art.... what else do you need?
Give this anime a honest chance and you will be pleasently suprised at how good it is, and best of all, you can watch the entire series now, episode-after-episode, without having to wait a week for the next episode.",10

                In chronological order, I've watched the original FMA series (dubbed over in English, unfortunately), read the manga, then watched FMA Brotherhood (subbed in English, thank GOD!) after giving myself plenty of time in between. If you liked the original, you will LOVE Brotherhood. As other reviews have pointed out, there's a lot to love about this series. Instead of re-hashing all that for you, I'll just point out the differences between the original and Brotherhood and why these differences are the reason that the show's worth watching.
Plot: the original series was really compelling as a stand alone. If you've never read the manga, then the
                  orignal isn't too bad. BUT, if you're like me and read the manga (albeit for me I read it AFTER watching the original), you'll notice that the manga has a far more developed plot. And, if you're like me and watched the original and was satisfied with it (more or less, it's flaws and all) and therefore put off with having to watch Brotherhood, a whole other series, and are worried of being disappointed, let me tell you, YOU WILL NOT BE. (want reason? look at other reviews, they all say the same stuff, like the first reveiw that pops up for this). Basically, the plot, since it follows the manga, is friggin amazingly AWESOME and in no way can I find a fault or anything to put it down. Well, actually, I could probably say that the Japanese have a flare for wordiness, but it's for our benefit, considering that there is a lot to take in.
Anyways, back to business. OTHER differences:
Sound: the music is much more dynamic in this series than in the original. There's a lot of varying during the whole series even though they do have a theme music they fall back to. But the music for this series reflects the darkness and twistedness of the plot. You get the sense of some underlying BAD right from the start because of the ambience the music produces. Then there are the voices for the characters, which were well picked, I believe, even for those who watched the original series and were put off by the thought of different voices screwing up preconceived ideas of the characters. None of this occured, but I'll get back to the point on the voices under Characters. Anyways, moving on, the beginning and ending credits change throughout the series, which in my opinion is a good thing because normally I would skip through credits, but the music and animation for them are worth the watch. Which leads me to my next point....
Design: one thing I noticed right away was that the background design differed from the first. The characters were still designed the same as the original, but the setting, like the music, created GREAT ambience. For instance, perspective is very effectively used to emphasize how twisted people can be. The angles for buildings or point of view angles are distorted, showing how distorted people can look at the world and how this world is full of some messed up stuff. It foreshadows the larger plot quite nicely. And anyone with an eye for design will notice how this change in perspective really helps to add to the whole series. It's very noticeable from the start for anyone who watched the original series, but as you progress through the episodes, you don't notice as much because you're so absorbed in the plot, but that doesn't mean that it's not still in use. Unlike the original, there was also much more effort put into the fluidity of the action scenes in Brotherhood. Like any anime, signs of laziness are evident the farther into the series you get. As though to make up for this, the action scenes, and even some of the smaller motions, like the swing of the head and hair, have amazing fluidity that makes watching the show such a delight for any anime fan who's tired of seeing lazy animation (no offence to animators, it's understandable that it would end up that way).
Characters: like some other review noted, because this series follows the original manga closely, you catch far more than just a wicked plot. There are great interactions between the characters. If you're like me and watched the original series but was disappointed that the girl didn't get the guy (sorta), then, because this follows the manga, you will be happy at how this series ends *hinthintwinkwink* (though that's pretty obvious). And like I said earlier, if you watched the original and liked the characters there, you'll love the characters even more in Brotherhood. There's more depth, more emotion, and the voices are well picked to reflect that (I was worried that I wouldn't be able to watch it because I really liked the English voices in the original, but the fact that the Japanese voices were so well chosen just goes to show that the English translation wasn't half bad for finding voices that were pretty similar. However, hands down, the Japanese is alwasy better!)
Overall: YOU. MUST. WATCH. THIS. If you're looking for something with depth, THIS IS IT. There's no fluff, there's no over-ambition (and given the kind of alternative world this is set in, what large ambitions there are seem reasonable enough, all things considered. And besides, without a little ambition, things'd be BOOOORING), there's no time-wasters. You'll dive right in and get hooked! Admitedly, it's fast paced relative to the orignal, but it's to your advantage. The majority of this series is dedicated to the latter half of the manga so that we get right into the grit of it, skipping over some of the fluffy beginning while not compromising it in the least. I only suggest that you don't do all 3 (original series, manga AND Brotherhood) all in one go. I gave myself some space in between because, as mach as I liked the original and LOVED the manga, you're almost put off by the idea of having to go through it ALL OVER AGAIN after JUST having gone through it all ONCE. But, after you've given yourself some R and R, GO FOR IT. It's worth it!",10

                One day my friend Derik ask me: do you watch Fullmetal? This happened when fullmetal alchemist was displayed in TV in my country. If i remember that time i was watching Knights of the Zodiac (Saint Seiya) in other channel so i do not care about Fullmetal. After a time i got a computer and because a recommendation a started to watch Fullmetal Alchemist. I enjoy it. I watched the movie too. I think it was a great end for the anime history. After i discover the studio who produced Fullmetal Alchemist modified the original history and because of that a new serie was launched,
                  following the story of manga. So i watched Fullmetal Alchemist Brothehood and have a conclusion:
The most of shounens is full of fights, fighs and fights. But Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood are not like this. FMAB combine a wonderful history, captivating characters, steampunk politc conflicts and creative fights. The saga of Van Hohenhein and his sons, Alphonse and Edward Eric is epic, a truly masterpiece of the animes. A short and outstanding anime!",10
"
                Trying to give myself reasons to not give this anime 10's across the board. Every aspect of this show is astounding and spoke to me at a personal level. This is my favorite anime of all time and I can't see that changing anytime soon. I can recommend this anime to anyone who watches anime or just shows in general. Anyone could be able to enjoy this show. The plot is so tight and thought out. At the end of almost every episode I saw myself awing at the twists an getting myself reeled back in to watch the next episode every time. The sheer
                  amount of times I have found myself dumbfounded by the engagement and pacing of the plot.The plot never drags on and always is throwing things at you at an astonishing rate yet it never gets overwhelming. Every set piece, character, character arc, and story line are executed almost perfectly. Each character has a distinct personality and relevance to the plot. The world building done is also fabulous, seeing as all of the settings can be connected in one big map, which makes everything piece together perfectly. I also never cared for anime soundtracks until I watched this. Every track is a phenomenal work of art I can listen to in itself. These tracks are distinct and make each scene even more invigorating. This why FMAB also has my favorite anime soundtrack. Studio Bones is one of the most talented and respected anime studios of all time. This can be seen in its brilliant animation and in every refined frame. The sakuga in some scenes is astounding. Some of the finest anime animation ever comes from this show and all of the work that has been put into the show and all of these minute details. I have come back time and time again to see this show and each time I like it even more. I would not say there is such thing as a perfect anime, but if there were to be one I would choose this.",10

                Strap yourselves in for an honest review of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood!
The publicly acclaimed ‘best anime ever made’. Does it live up to the hype surrounding it? Distancing myself from bias as much as I could, I embarked on a critical rewatch to find out.
Story: 9.15 / 10
As far as action-adventure stories go, it is great. I would throw some criticism in the way of the pacing; specifically throughout the first 30 episodes where everything is buildup and things often feel rather slow when compared to the last 20-or-so episodes – where everything that was built up culminates in one intense section that is executed
                  well. The issues with the pacing aren’t major here, since it more so affected my enjoyment than me being able to call it bad. I would call the story over the first 30 episodes decent, the next 14 episodes good and the final 20 episodes great. The only instance worthy of complaint within the final section is a specific scene very close to the conclusion that makes overuse of action protagonist tropes and nonsensical strength that is purely there to satisfy the audience rather than to uphold the integrity of storytelling. Other than that and the slower-paced first third, the story is great.
Art: 8.78 / 10
The general animation style is good and above all, consistent. Many of the action scenes looked great and none of the scenes ever looked terrible. There is however a separate gag-style for comedic use, and this, to me, was very unfunny, poorly placed and felt like it was aimed at a young audience – which is clearly not the target market since children would not exactly appreciate seeing God, war or human mutilation on a regular basis (or if they do appreciate it, they could not fully understand it). My interpretation of the comedic style had more influence on my enjoyment, however, since as far as gag-art styles go, it was fine. All in all, the art style was unique and the animation varying between good and great.
Sound: 8.73 / 10
The soundtrack is recognizable and was used very well to uphold tension and attach weight to events – especially in the final third of the series. More impressive, though, was the music choice for a number of OP’s and ED’s that fit the progression of the story well and was outright catchy. As far as the sound effects and characters go; the effects were good and the characters sounded good overall. There are a few characters whose voices sound rather annoying in both the subbed and dubbed versions, but some of those may have been as designed to change the viewer’s perception of said characters.
Character: 7.45 / 10
The biggest complaint I have about Brotherhood is concerning the characters. Very few of them are likeable to me at all. I actively dislike 4 characters, the main character, Edward, being one of them. He is a cocky, condescending child who is never brought down to earth since he is always right and can always make up conditions that allow him to make the best out of any situation. He talks down to everyone for no reason and even in times of apparent peril, he can just solve it seemingly purely because he is the protagonist (which also leads into the dislikeable scene near the end). Of course Ed is built to fit the badass justice enforcer stereotype, but he just comes off to me as a dislikeable person as well as the singular cause of many contrivances. Because of that, I think his positive popularity is undeserved. The other dislikeable characters are either equally condescending or are just ridiculously powerful without explanation. There are those on the opposite end of the spectrum; Roy Mustang being a very good character, a respectable person and also fun to watch. In general, then, the characters are decent; a couple of annoyingly bad ones, a couple of great ones and the rest being just fine.
Enjoyment: 7.75 / 10
I didn’t enjoy Brotherhood as much as I should have. Some of the reasons have already been brought up in this review: the gag-comedy style, the in-your-face dislikeable characters and the somewhat dragged-out pacing in the first half. Other things that I didn’t enjoy are more minor things spread throughout; like some inconsistencies with the use of alchemy – specifically characters choosing not to use alchemy for situations that could clearly be made much easier by using it, rather inconsistent power scaling throughout and the abundance of time spent focusing on the dislikeable protagonist. I did however enjoy the final 10 episodes quite a lot.
Overall: 8.37/ 10
I wouldn’t argue against anyone calling Brotherhood the best action-adventure anime out there. It does many things very well and caters to a pretty wide audience. My enjoyment aside, I don’t think it is flawless. In fact, it has more narrative issues than a couple of other anime I have seen. But I can also see why so many people would be able to overlook those issues and have such a high opinion of Brotherhood. In the end, I don’t think it is the best anime ever made, but with the right mindset, it could certainly become a favorite within its genre.",8

                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is easily a top tier shonen anime!!
When I first watched this series, I didn't make it past the first few episodes because I was skeptical and ended up sleeping on this masterpiece. In my mid teens at the time. However, after re-watching and finishing the series several months ago, man I was wrong! FMAB is one of the greatest stories and anime I've ever seen. 
Reasons being is because it has everything you could ask for and does everything right and brings it justice. Most, if not all characters feel important to the story. Awesome soundtracks and character designs, the emotions of
                  whether there's an intense fight scene, awkward funny moments or even the sad and horrific backstories of it's characters. All in all, this is an awesome anime and most people who I've asked about this series usually say great things. Looking for flaws, I didn't really find much except at first listening to Edward complain a lot but as the story unfolded I appreciated him much more. Looking back at this series, I really had a fun time watching Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Enjoy!

                A science that teaches you how to create object from raw materials. Thats basically what alchemy is about. Our story resolves around alchemy and specifically two young boys determined to get their lost bodies back as a price they paid for braking the most important tule in alchemy.
If one wishes to obtain something, something of equal value must be given. Or else equilevant exchange.
Follow our two protagonist Ed and Al in a journey to find the secrets of alchemy, while they try to protect their friends.Fighting against strong opponents, finding new allies and progress throught etchical and moral choices they have to make.
Not much to
                  say, trying to be objective at one of my favorite  (if not the best) animes I have ever seen.
Ingredibly intelligent plot with beautifull main and supportive charachters, each one developing in a unique way and following their own paths. One of the best voice actors choosen, eveyone fitting the roles the voice with an exhellent soundtrack production.
An all around perfect anime must see by everyone and a personal life changer experience that you wont regret spending their times",10
"
                Everyone should watch this anime it is a great starting point for anyone everything about it is a masterpiece in storytelling in character development in everything.
The two protagonists are the best part of the show and Al is one of my favourite anime characters of all time, I would recommend this to non-anime fans and hardcore along side each other I watched this on Netflix way back in 2014 when I was 12 and most of the scenes still stick with me today a truly beautiful but haunting experience, a story about loss, forgiveness, revenge and yes brotherhood.  
I would say that scar is
                  probably the most complex character I have seen in anime history.",10
"
                This show made me laugh, cry and feel sick. Although it is very plot-driven, the characters were appealing enough, the fighting was well done, and several hard themes such as cival war, identity, humanity and the strong bond between two brothers were woven into this much appealing story. The Alchemy element really adds to the whole and could well serve as an example for the scientific progress, including its ethical side. The plot is complex, confusing at times, but well-told. Every time you think you get the story, it becomes more complicated and makes you wonder if there is an end to the revelations. 
This
                  is the first anime that I have encountered where within a few episodes a child that you actually care about, dies. I do not like drama for the drama, but this occurence fits well within the story that the writers wanted to tell us: the human deficit when it comes to choices of life and death and all the trauma that it depicts, while on the other hand the question rises how to remain and act human. 
Ed and Al are brothers who have committed a terrible sin. It hits back in their face multiple times during the series but also gives them a strong drive to do what they do: Ed being a State Alchemist, or rather, a dog of the military, and his younger brother Al supports him. Their main goal is to get their bodies back. 
The result of their terrible sin, which they committed to bring their beloved mother back from the death, is that Ed misses his right arm and left leg, and Al is no more than a soul bound to a suit of armor. Ed's missing limbs were replaced by automail, granting him the name of Full Metal Alchemist. 
The two brothers are supported by a range of people from the military and foreign countries. As the serires is mostly plot-driven, the characters seem to fit somewhere in this plot. I have to note here that although this may reduce the versatility of each character, I believe that in real life there is not much room for this versatility anyways, as the common goal or the greater good demands certain behaviour. Luckily, the writers included some great plot twists for us. 
Another good part of this series is that the line between good guys and bad guys is basically non-existent. It fits very well with the shows` themes on the ethcial issues from life and death choices. The 'bad guys' here are no more than the rebels with a personal story that drives them to do what they do, no more than Ed and Al. There is Scar, from the adjacent country of Ishval where a massacre took place, the Homunculi that are named after the seven sins, and royalties from the adjacent country of Xing. They all have their own goals and are willing to fight for it. 
Somehow I never like movies or series with a strong accent on the romance and I was happy to discover that FMA has some subtle, developing romances. The relationships between Ed and Winry (childhood friend of the brothers and automail expert), Al and Winry, Roy and Riza, and a few others are all exapmles of that. There's no obscenity, rather silence on the matter, but by showing their communiation (or lack of it) the relationships are naturally evolving. There is some stereotyping here (might be because it is still shounen) as both Winry and Rize are supporting their male counterpart in a similar way. It did however not disturb me and felt quite fitting with the whole of the show. 
Though somehow, towards the end, the plot seemed to drown in abstract god-like schemes, throw-over the kingdom from the insde-plans. It was a little disapointing considering all the plot twists I had endured and fairly vague. I did like the ""talking black furry ball in a glass jar"" (no spoiler here) but I still wonder where it came from. I might have to rewatch the series to see if I maybe missed a crucial line or visual somehwere. It did however made me realise that the writers mostly wanted to tell a sad but true story and created characters to tell it for them. In that case, it was very well done. 
In general, it was a good step to widen the story line with an attack on Amestris, that intertwined with the brothers` search for the Philospher's Stone, but the few last episodes felt a bit like: how on earth do we end this in a constructive way? And that kinda failed. 
In all this was a very compelling show. I could identify with the characters and the story itself holds a lot of difficult yet unsolved issues that reflect good thinking of the writers.",9
"
                FMA: B is one of the first animes I watched, needless to say it's one of the most important ones for how my preferences developed and one of my all-time favorites as well.
There is little more that I can say about this anime then that it is truly great, an adventure from beginning to the end in which you follow the characters, see them grow and change as the story unwraps. Deaths and sad moments, wholesome ships between characters as well as epic fighting scenes. All of it is incorporated in Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.
To summarize for those at the beginning of their path towards watching
                  anime basically as a hobby: watch it, it's nothing less than a masterpiece.",10
"
                Ok everyone knows why this anime is good, but because of the minimum word limit, ill just reexplain. But scroll down for why i didnt go for a full 10. There are issues people...
Story is mad good obviously. Its paced so well, with emotional arcs perfectly plotted. The logic and science of this work are so well done that i can't beleive it.
The characters are really solid when they need to be. You dont really understand their brilliance untill you see all their flashbacks and how their stories end. Its really a sight to behind.
Art is solid, and so is sound.
I enjoyed it quite a
                  bit.
Ok, now for the bad.
I really hated certain points of the story. One of them being Envy. I thought envy was just a lazy character. It was just annoying, and seemed like it had no character traits. You might say, Hey, its envy, that's the point, but no. I disagree. Envy is a clear character trait, and while it was present, it was not exemplified in the story. Sorry, Envy is just a bad character.
Same with Greed, and the other dude. Greed's logic makes little sense. I really found him to be confusing as he flip flopped ideologies. He never had a core set of values, even at the end when that was supposed to be ambiguous. I just really hated his arc. Plus the emperor and his relationship was kinda bs.
Finally, i really didn't like the symbolic ending. It was too abstract right before the final fight. I didnt get it, and it was explained as it went on. I kinda get it now, but so much doesn't line up. Same thing happens a lot through the series. The heroes' do some weird stuff and no one questions it because its meant to be thematic. Ok sure. Whatever. Everything else is soooo sick tho.",9
"
                I will say that the overall anime is pretty solid and a straight 9 . But indeed there are some arcs in the story that just feels its being dragged on. 
Overall , the characters were well written , But 4 of them were written a little better than the others IMO , These are Mustang , Scar , King Bradley and Hohenhiem. 
The music choices were good . 
The Promised Day arc was probably the best overall , though at some point it felt like it was being dragged on. 
The only flaw was before the promised day arc , Information is thrown
                  at you like a bullet train , and the pacing of the story felt rushed. 
Overall , A Solid 9/10 . A great story with brilliant execution .",9

                ""Hiromu Arakawa Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood yet great entry in this long-running franchise thanks to Yashiro Irie and Romi Park.""
- YESTORAKS, GeeKon Magazines
Over the course of 64 episodes, Fullmetal Alchemist has basically turned into the greatest anime where Romi Park voice acted does crazy stunts. Brotherhood, the newest entry,is no exception—and I’d have it no other way. Yashiro Irie—he directed this anime as well as its predecessor 2003 version—seems to have cracked the code to this long-running franchise. In Brotherhood, the story is negligible. There’s enough plot to keep the momentum and the twists keep it engaging. Yashiro seems to be the perfect match to star
                  Romi Park‘s unique voice acted take on action.
The difference between the action in this movie and the action in the equally audacious Cowboy Bebop franchise is that in Brotherhood, Yashiro captures the action in a clean and economical way. It’s the reason Cowboy Bebop was so successful. Every action set piece has a narrative pulse whether it be a two on one brawl in a bathroom or an snow fight or a final arc—the best scene in the anime and possibly of the year.
In Brotherhood, we begin three years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity. Refreshingly, that main plot, which is set up breezily in the cold open—it features an amusing cameo by Wolf Blitzer—is the goal for the entire film. Unlike the Hunter x Hunter animes which have twisting plots that end up somewhere different than where they started, Brotherbood stays focused.
Romi Park is infamous for concocting crazier and crazier stunts that she voice acted herself. While it seemed like a publicity ploy, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood makes it clear why she’s been indispensable until now. Her screen presence is irreplaceable specifically when she is performing action. Now that she’s found a director that knows how to capture them, the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise has found new life. Don’t let us down Edward. That is your mission, should you choose to accept it.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist was the first anime I ever watched and I am happy to say I'm glad that it was. Honestly, I have to say that Brotherhood was the better of the two. The first season was great but the ending and some plot changes (compared to the manga) were just some things I didn't like I guess. Brotherhood was funny, creative, heart pounding, and heart wrenching. This series is unlike any other with the story of two brothers in search of something they're not sure even exists: the Philosopher's Stone.
Just reading about FMA: Brotherhood drags you in and once you start watching it, you'll
                  be sucked in for sure. This series was done very well and it will always have a place in my heart.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist. Fullmetal Alchemist. Wow. What can I say about this anime that has not been said already? This critically acclaimed underrated masterpiece, albeit being the top rated anime on this website, has been analyzed, dissected and thorougly researched this decade, but its surface has barely been scratched.
""Non fortuna homines aestimabo, sed moribus"" (I do not estimate the men for their fortune, but their habits) - A famous latin quote by the roman stoic philosopher Lucius Anneus Seneca The Younger, better known as Seneca the Younger, perfectly encapsulates the core messages and themes of this beautifully written anime/manga. 
It would serve a severe injustice to
                  the creators, the fans, the writers and everyone else to even try to understand the grand themes and the social commentary of this manga which serves to reflect our current state of affairs in society, or in Layman's terms, a disservice to even attempt to give a sufficiently detailed report without appearing disingenious; ergo I will not.
Ali out.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of the highest rated anime of all time, and as someone who finished the series I can see why. Real stakes, real characters, and real fun. I've been excited to write this review for a while, so let's get into those juicy details.
Story (9):
The story of FMAB is very coherent and I was never once confused during the story. They expanded upon the universe and each of the important characters very well, and they always did a good job of weaving each of the arcs together. As someone who never watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist, I was surprised that I
                  was never lost in the story besides the first few minutes of the first episode. All of the arcs were exciting to varying degrees, with the most 'boring' arc being just a 7 from me. The story kept getting better and better with each episode, which only made me more excited to keep watching. I can't talk about the detail of the ending, but it was really amazing and definitely worth the journey. 
Art (9):
The artwork for this series is great. The metallic colors and shades as well as the duller pastels really added to the more serious tone of this anime. FMAB does have some comedy moments, but the art style perfectly represents what it was going for; a more series anime that wants to make you FEEL the stakes. The artwork and colors do a great job of reminding us of the intents and purposes of this anime. 
Sound (7):
The sound for this series was really good and did what it was supposed to do, but it wasn't anything too special. I noticed the sound, such as metal clanking or gunfire or Alchemical noise, and it always fit the occasion and did a good job of drawing attention to what was happening on the screen, but I was never like ""woah that's some awesome sound"" I was more like ""this is good, but I am too focused on the art to notice this"". 
Characters (10):
The characters in this anime are really perfect. I always either felt a strong attachment and relatability to the struggles of some of the ""good guys"" like Edward or absolutely despised the ""bad guys"" of this anime. I really like how even with the ""bad guys"" of the series I actually was able to understand WHY they were doing the things they were, which made them relatable in a way too. This is something many series miss out on that FMAB really did well. I could understand the goals of every character in this anime, which made it all the more investing. 
Enjoyment (10):
As I think I mentioned earlier, this series kept getting more and more exciting with every episode. Each arc seemed to improve from the previous one, with the exception of a couple moments that felt a little off for me. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed this series as a 10 despite its flaws because I understood what it was going for and that happened to be something that is right up my alley. 
Overall (10):
If you like lighthearted series, you probably won't like FMAB. This series is more serious than most anime around, and while it does work in its favor, I realize that's not for everyone. If you love high stakes, intensity, and sometimes even a feeling of powerlessness followed by overcoming all odds, you'll probably like this series. Don't let me choose your path though, if you want to watch it, just go for it. You can always drop it later if you don't like it, but I think you'll probably enjoy it, but if you don't, well, I am sorry.",10
"
                 I wish I had some Japanese people to talk to about this series because it effected me deeply. It had such depth to it that said a lot past the story line I felt and I am very glad I watched it on many levels.
  The story was done well. In a way you needed to see the Full Metal Alchemist orig. series first. Because the Brotherhood got deeply into parts that were left hanging and just not clearly done in the first one. It made a point of giving all the people (and sort of people) depth and a reason why they
                  did what they did and what they were all really after.  The moral lessons in it took me by surprise and opened up my eyes in a way no other show has before and made me a better person because of it. This is very very rare of any show/cartoon or anything in life so I really got into it on many levels as I said before.
  I think this one has to be watched a few times to really get things put together because it is pretty complex and easy to miss a lot just watching it once or twice.",10
"
                Don't get me wrong it's a good anime, but there are just so many better animes out there.
Things that annoyed me:
All the openings except the first one
I wanted more screen time for Ling/Greed and Lan Fan
The story was stretched out for too long
There were no intimate relationships
Main characters pondered over important decisions for too long instead of being decisive
Not set in a real life(or similar) settingThings that I liked:
Characters- you grew attached
The story is interesting
The first opening
The variety of alchemists
Summary:
It's a good anime but I would put it at the same level as the first season of sword art online but not as good as Attack On Titan/Shingeki no Kyojin.",8
"
                A Shounen Masterpiece. I can see why it still top the MAL list for a long time
Story 9/10: Its getting darker in the second half of the series and the final sequence (promise day arc) is easily on my top 3 list of the best shounen anime arc ever made. I love the daily life portrayal in this series because it gives a right balance towards a non-stop action happening in the series
Music 9/10: Amazing. All the OP and ED are well curated and well made and perfect for this series.
Characters 10/10: Characters are what FMAB leads in comparison to other shonen anime. Each of
                  the character is so unique and each of them has their own personalty. Personally, i like Elric Alphonse and Roy Mustang, they are both strong, competitive, but somehow so funny and kind, love em!
Art 8/10: For 2009 anime, it is pretty good and for sure it way better than the 2003 FMA 
One of the most well written series of all time and also one of the best ending i've witness
A masterpiece thats for sure and it lives up to this hype.",9
"
                I will preface this by saying I am very VERY biased. I feel the original story was better. The original ending was far more resonating. The purpose of remaking FMA was just to shut fans up that did nothing but complain about the original ending. To silence those critics, they gave those fans the sappy, disney-like ending that they begged for. The ending I didnt enjoy. 
Here is my reasoning, the original was far more tragic and was more fitting for the  context of the entire anime. The whole anime is about the tragic events that lead up to that end. And it emphasizes
                  equivalent exchange as it is intended. I absolutely LOVE that Edward had to give up his body for Alphonse to get his back. Winrey never got to tell Ed she loved him. So many tragedies that shows the viewer that not everything comes out like the movies. Not everything gets a happy ending. 
What I DIDNT like about the original is that they left the window open for Ed to return to his world. It would've been better if he was permanently trapped in our version of earth. The emphasis needs to be that he can never go back. Ed and Al played god, and they got punished for it. To give Ed the ability to return to his own earth deminishes that punishment completely. 
FMA: Brotherhood is a bastardization of that story to please some critics that couldnt deal with an ending that wasnt very ""disney like."" Ed lives and gets to marry Winrey. Alphonse gets his body back. Al still hates milk. Its all happy ending horseshit. 
The only positives I have to say about this version is the addition of Olivier Mira Armstrong. She is BOSS! And, it never gets more badass than Col. Roy ""muthaf'in"" Mustang. When he snaps King Bradley to crispy goodness, I had a nerdgasm. That was hot fire!
Overall, FMA: Brotherhood is a good anime. It does deserve to be treated as one of the best anime to ever be made. But calling it a masterpiece is a fallacy. And that is one of the absolute WORST things about Myanimelist is the amount of trend followers that sometimes frequent here. Some, not all, but some dont have any real fact based opinion on this anime. They are just told that this anime is a masterpiece, so they follow along with what they are told. But this anime doesnt deserve first place. At least in my opinion, Cowboy Bebop should be #1. Not this anime. FMA: Brotherhood is a great anime, just not a masterpiece and a little overrated.",8
"
                There is nothing I can say about this show that would make it better than it already is.
It's a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The characters are was inspiring, the music is breath taking, and no other show has made me feel the emotions of the protagonists with such intensity.
There is nothing bad to say about this show and i'm sure anyone else who has watched it feels the same.
It’s impossible for it to be rated any higher because it serves as a benchmark that all modern anime are measured against in terms of nearly every characteristic. Must watch this Anime and tell
                  me again how anime like this can't be art in itself.",10
"
                Simply put, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of the finest pieces of media I've laid eyes on. The world and lore are constructed in such a way that it leaves you wanting more, and the characters are written in such a way that even the worst of the antagonists you can feel some degree of sympathy or pity for, apart from a few who you grow to be in a love-hate relationship with. And then there's Shou Tucker.
Story
An area where the show excels in particular. Throughout the series, you learn more about the shadowy past of the militaristic country Amestris, as well as the obviously
                  China-like Xing and the tragic, horrifying past of Ishval. Throughout the series, more details are revealed about the countries and the world around the protagonists, uncovering a countrywide conspiracy that threatens the lives of them and everyone around them.
It doesn't let up on plot twists, either. I could name several different occasions where I was shocked, terrified, sad or all 3. This show knows how to wring emotions or shock out of you, and just when you think the plot will let up for a few episodes it pulls you straight back into the nitty gritty and never lets go. Even the obligatory recap episode is masterfully done, giving an insight into an important character's psyche and mindset, helping us learn about him and what he is.
Art
Rather standard anime artstyle, however for the comedy moments it distorts itself into chibi faces and bodies that look absolutely adorable. An example of times like these are in the hugely entertaining ''4-panel comic theater'' OVAs, funny little shorts that parody major story events. 
The series has the ability to alternate from these styles to a more serious style in a matter of seconds depending on the tone of the story, which is rather impressive. The peak of the animation is in the jaw-droppingly fluid fight scenes with multiple characters, which, late in the series, somehow get even better, spanning several episodes that all culminate in a satisfying end. It's hard to explain without spoilers, but you'll be amazed.
Sound
The OST is very good. Particularly, the track ''The Awakening'' is one of my favorite BGM pieces in anime. More importantly, the opening and closing themes are all AMAZING. They tonally fit the show, such as the final OP, ''Rain'' by Sid, which has an air of tragedy to it, yet is still hopeful. Like the whole show, really. By virtue of being the first, the first OP and ED will probably stick with you the most. If there's a weak spot, it would be the fourth OP in my opinion, while still excellent it's very very loud compared to the rest and really goes all out. Of course it's still fantastic and fits for that arc of the show.
Characters
This is what the show does undisputably well. Edward Elric, the titular Fullmetal Alchemist, goes through a realistic growth throughout the series, both physically and mentally. It is hard to talk about his growth without delving into spoilers, so I'll talk about my favorite part of the entire show. The villains.
The homunculi are the driving force between many of the acts in the series, and make for a formidable leigon of antagonists. Some are entirely sympathetic and innocent (Gluttony), some are absolutely hateable bastards who still get moments of sympathy (Envy, Pride, Wrath) but they all make for extremely compelling villains who I personally couldn't wait to see more of. 
Even the non-homunculi villains are extremely effective. Take Kimblee, the psychotic State Alchemist with a twisted moral foundation, or the mysterious Scar, who while appearing to be outright evil, has hidden depths and layers as well as genuienly understandable motives under the surface. That's not even getting into Shou Tucker (and to a lesser extent the cryptic Gold-Toothed Doctor), one of the most hated anime characters of all time and for good reason.
Apart from the villains and central characters, the side characters all have extremely compelling arcs that are as good if not better than the Elric brothers. Colonel Roy Mustang and Riza Hawkeye in particular have an arc running throughout the entire show that's extremely emotional, and is done incredibly. I couldn't possibly talk about them all here, so you'll have to wait and see.
Enjoyment
As I stated at the start of this review, this anime is absolutely incredible. Every arc is masterfully done and concluded, with an amazing, fleshed out lore and universe that has massive potential to still be expanded (I'm not the only one who'd love a spin off about Xing). Every character is memorable for one reason or another, and honestly, there aren't any faults that I can think of right now. It's a masterpiece not just in anime, but in all of pop culture it's incredibly unique and nothing else is quite like it. 
Simply put? Watch it.
As a sidenote, watch the dubbed version. It's a very very good dub, and is nearly unanimously agreed to be better than the sub. Take time to get used to it and you'll appreciate it.
Second sidenote: watch the outtakes. They're amazing.",10

                There are anime that you have to watch. There are anime that are overrated and underrated (in your opinion and my opinion.) There are anime that go as quickly as they entered on in the scene. And yet this show always stayed. As a reminder of how to do a shounen correctly. FMAB is hands down one of the greatest pieces of art ever to come out of this medium. And it is great that this site advertises this show as an essential watch for everybody, veterans and newcomers alike. The show has now been talked about for over a decade, and will be talked
                  about for decades to come.
This anime is here for a reason, and is not just for a overrated opinion. FMAB have a great plot, with not as simple development of either the characters or the story itself. And besides all that, fullmetal has a great ending that finishes all the story in a great and not so obvious way. Every aspect of this anime is here to stay and can be so appreciated with all the episodes. This is a shounen with rules, and rules that are followed. This matter of fact creates a pure sensation of danger and understanding in the right situations (something that many shounens fail at) and just that is enough to enhance FMAB to another level too.
Just give it a try ;)

                What is there to say. Constantly being at the top, praised by the community. Despite being a re-adaptation of an older series, it goes further beyond the original. One of the exceptions to the overall idea that run-backs aren't generally better than the original. Shorter that most of the big three whether it be the old or the new. It's story still leaves you satisfied despite being slight shorter. The overall story is simple and easy to follow even for those who are watching anime for the first time. Little to no plot hole left by the end of the series. 
Each character developed throughout
                  the show allows for that much more investment. A connection can be made to almost any character. Art style is mostly on point. When it really matters, you can see the investment to the creators have in this anime. The sound track is iconic with most of the opening reaching heights rarely reached. Introduction that this anime have given to many people into the world of anime cannot be understated either.",10

                Figured it was about time I reviewed my personal favorite anime. I've rewatched this bad boy around six times, I lost count after that. I love it more and more with each rewatch, especially when exposing new anime fans to it, seeing them enjoy something I love wholeheartedly is noteworthy in itself.
OKAY. Where to even begin?
I did watch all of the original FMA animation. It was good, though the pacing was a little jarring. FMA:B definitely does the series justice, and follows the manga pretty closely. It flows nicely and everything is super fleshed out. You certainly do not need to watch the original first
                  or anything, it does switch some things up with the story and characters.
STORY
Listen, I'm a big shoujo fan. I'm not one to choose a super action packed anime let alone anything over 25 episodes if I can help it. I rarely find a series I enjoy that much nowadays...BUT when I watched FMA:B the first time I was beyond hooked, and still am with each rewatch. The story is D E N S E. With capital letters. Everything and anything is fleshed out. I find the story flows extremely well throughout the episodes, to a super satisfying conclusion. I didn't have many questions after it finished, and if I did, I found the answer pretty quickly after some googling, it was usually something explained that I just missed or it went over my head.
The premise was unique. Two brothers who performed an alchemic taboo to bring their dead mother back to life, that failed miserably and left them with severe consequences. They endure numerous trials and tests to hopefully gain what they had lost, meeting many interesting characters along the way, and twists that put a kink in their plans.
I loved the story so much. I found the concept of alchemy and the use of it in this show to be extremely fascinating. The fight scenes were gripping and again, as someone who isn't too keen on action, they were great!
There's quite a decent bit of comedic relief, moreso in the earlier episodes before things get more serious. This was a little offputting for some of the people I convinced to give the show a shot, as some scenes can be a little ""cringey"" and ""screamy"" but it's easy to look past them and as the show goes on they are more intentional and fit better in my opinion. 
CHARACTERS
Without a doubt my favorite lineup of characters. One of the only shows I finished and could remember the names of every character, even years between rewatches. I loved how unique each character was, both in design and the powers/personalities they had. I grew to like most all of the characters, even the villains. They were just too cool to not respect in the very least.
I normally grow tired with side character backstory and anything that deviates from the main story and characters, but FMA:B managed to make every character so interesting, I actually wanted to know about each of them, which rarely happens in anime these days for me.
SOUND & ART
I adore the soundtrack and OPs&EDs of FMA:B. No idea how they managed to procure so many total unskippable bangers. I listen to them all on a weekly basis. Even the background music was fitting and amazing. 
The art is very well done, especially during the fighting scenes. It's a little hard to believe this came out in 2009. 
OVERALL
I can't recommend this show enough, even to the newest of anime watchers. You will fall in love with the diverse characters and rich storylines. I cry after every rewatch, it's such a bittersweet feeling, and one that hasn't been replicated by any other show I've seen since then. I can't wait to enjoy this show along with my future children, that's how great it is.
I love to say that FMA:B encompasses a large range of genres. Sure it has action and fighting, but it also has a lot of drama, politics, varied antagonists, lots of twists, and even romance. It has a bit of everything for everyone, and that's one of the many things I love about this show. Please give this show a shot, and although many label it ""overrated"" it certainly is NOT. This story deserves every ounce of praise it's received since 2009. I've seen nearly 200 anime titles and nothing has ever come even remotely close to this one.",10
"
                The ending made me ball, watched it over the course of 4 months with my close friend and I enjoyed learning and connecting with the characters. Please take time out of your day or week or month or year to watch this. Absolute masterpiece.
Easily the best part is the relationship between the brothers but the foreshadowing is excellent too and each section is distinct and has new and interesting reoccurring characters.
I cannot recommend this show enough. It deserves the #1 place for sure even though it may not be my personal favorite of all time. It has all the right emotions.

                This series is a little more darker than the original series which I totally enjoy. The original series also had filler when this series did not. This series gave me a lil more emotion that FMA’03 ever did. And part of FMA’03 didn’t make much sense like brotherhood did.
Original series: 6
Brotherhood: 8
The reason brotherhood is a 8 is because 
1. The jokes were not really funny
2. Some parts were kinda awkward 
Why FMA’03 Was a 6.
1. filler
2. Jokes were bad
3. To much plot holes 4. Not very emotional or interesting to watch (except some scenes)
Brotherhood had better art to and was easy to look at, FMA’03 Was not so easy to look at because of the background and the way they drew it/Animated it.",8

                 My favorite anime of all time !
I have enjoyed every episodes and every characters of this show. I have a short attention span yet this is one of the only animes that have captivated me from start to finish.
This anime will always hold a place in my heart because it came at a very stressful and a not so happy moment in my life. I find the story really profound and enjoyable and I find the main characters, as well as the secondary characters, very compelling and loveable.
The art is amazing and very unique and the ost is honestly one of the best ost’s
                  of all time.
Overall, this is anime is a 10/10 for me !",9
"
                FMAB is pretty good, but you need to watch the original FMA in order to get the full experience imo. The characters and story are great, the first few episodes are not good in comparison to fma but after about episode 12 it picks up. The soundtrack per episode is noticeably repetitive, but the opening songs vary from ok to good. This is not the greatest anime ever and really doesn't deserve any #1 moniker, however it is enjoyable and it has a good end.
tl;dr flawed but good, watch the first few episodes of fma 2003 at least prior to fmab.

                I'll try to make this short, because most of what's been said about this thing have already been said. I'll start with the Cons.
CONS: Pacing is an issue on this one, and it's a big one. There's a lot to enjoy but it doesn't always flow well from point to point. There's filler at times that is largely kinda lame. At tad bit overhyped.
PROS: Great, memorable characters with a lot to love about them are bursting at the seams. I can't quite remember the last time I watched an anime of this length and thought so fondly about so many small fries, narratively speaking. Amazing
                  sound design. Amazing main plot. Interesting and deep themes, particularly those about war and statehood. Some great romances. One of the few anime to ever actually make me cry. 
I don't know why you're reading this. If you're on MAL, I don't know how you haven't watched it already. If you're looking to knock this one off its perch at the top of this site, more power to you. It has flaws. But it's easily one of the most accessible, most generally enjoyable anime on the books, and I loved my time with it.",9
"
                Hi, this is my first review, I hope it's good...
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an extremely highly rated show. It has been the #1 highest rated show on MAL for over a decade. It's the 3rd most popular anime as of today. But does it live up to the hype? Yes. It absolutely does.
But before I review this series I must reveal some biases I might have. This was the first anime I ever watched (outside of Pokémon), and I haven't watched a lot of anime (I've only been watching for about 3 months), so I didn't really have any other anime to compare it to.
                  Secondly, I haven't seen the 2003 series, though I have heard a lot about it.
Now, on to the review:
STORY: 9/10
Brotherhoods story was great. The plot is concise, easily understandable, and has one of the most satifying conclusions in any media, ever. The pacing was a little off for the first 12 or so episodes (because that was already covered in the '03 version), but it definitely picks up the slack at the masterpiece that is episode 19. For the rest of the series, the pacing is on point, with diverse locals, mysteries of alchemy and goverment conspiricies.
CHARACTERS: 10/10
I think I can still name a COUPLE DOZEN characters from this series and say a little about them. These are some of the most memorable characters I've ever seen. Edward is great protagonist, and Alphonse bounces off of him quite nicely. The ''Edward is short'' joke got a little (haha) old eventually, but it pops up less often further into the series. Roy Mustang is badass, Hawkeye is also really cool. The main villians all have entertaining personalities, and you can even sympathise with some of them. The character development was also amazing.
ANIMATION: 10/10
This show was made by Studio Bones, so this rating shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody. This show has some of the best fights I've ever seen. Character designs were all memorable and the world looked awesome.
SOUND: 9/10
The opening were all bangers (especially the first one), and even some of the endings were bops. This show has ONE OF THE BEST DUBS EVER, and it's hard the top the voice acting in the sub, so that's saying something. The music used in the show was good, but I didn't remember a lot of it.
ENJOYMENT: 10/10
This show had me HOOKED. I loved each and every episode (except the recap, that episode was okay), and I watched the last 9 episodes of the show in one day (that's a 
lot for me). I couldn't shut up about this anime when I was talking to other people either, much to their dismay.
OVERALL: 9.6/10 (Rounded out to a 10/10)
This show is amazing, and if you haven't seen it yet, DROP ANYTHING YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW AND WATCH IT. The flaws are so minor, you might as well call them nitpicks. So, I can't feasibly give this show anything lower than a 10.",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an anime masterpiece and it dethroned Avatar: The last Airbender to become the best anime series to date! An absolute ""Must-Watch"" for anyone who appreciates great animation, outstanding character design and a solid plot. There are plenty of heart-warming moments as well as some soul-crushing ones, a massive array of badass fight scenes, solid dialogue, great comedy, a bit of romance, this series really does have it all!
Watching this anime is like watching the first season of 24. You think you can watch just an episode or two and then go about your life but suddenly, nine hours have gone by
                  and you should have been in bed six hours ago and now you are gonna have to call in sick because you are in no condition to go to work in the morning. Brotherhood grabs you by the balls and doesn't let go until it is done.",10
"
                FMAB might be the perfect anime.
Story: 10
The writing in this anime is beyond phenomenal. It keeps you engaged, and it leaves you wanting more. It manages to communicate its philosophies and its themes in a way that feels so impactful and meaningful.
Art: 9
I'm very tempted to give it a 10. The animation is crisp yet fluid, and I enjoy the art style a lot. The fight scenes are amazing. Sound: 9
The first opening might be the greatest opening in anime of all time. And it's not even the only opening in this show I can say that about. Enough said.
Character: 10
This might be the show's greatest strength. The characters are all complex and layered with personality, ideals, and motivations. Edward and Alphonse are the driving force behind this show, but they aren't the only great characters. Winry, Roy Mustang, and especially Hohenheim are all some of my favorite characters, period. What's more, the antagonists are also absolutely outstanding.
Enjoyment: 10
I love this show so much. It is so well-written, so well-produced, and just off of the merits of its quality alone, managed to earn a 10 in enjoyment.
Overall: 10
What can I say? I can't find a single fault. Not one crack, in 64 episodes. It's phenomenal. It's way too good. It might be one of the best TV shows, not just one of the best anime.",10

                The Perfect Anime?
Yes yes it is. Hell i wish all animes where like this but then i feel i wouldn't be able to have some fun reviewing animes that are hidden gems
Listen this anime is Myanimelist top anime if that isn't enough to convice you why are you reading reviews but if it was that simple then i wouldn't be doing this.
Funny enough this was one of those animes that i'd be fine not watching but i watched it with a friend who loves this show and over the couple days of watching it i never got bored, this show has enough going on that
                  you are constantly entertained but not enough that you're super confused with the amount of stuff going on. The one thing this anime does better than anything else is the characters and their relationships each character feels real i didn't find a character i overly hated it was just i like those better than others.
The story is well crafted with a nice couple of twist and turns with a great mystery to boot but the one thing i find most impressive is that has several moments to slow down and let the characters catch their breaths which allows the audience to take a breath as well and not have plot and exposition thrown in their face constantly 
FMA Brotherhood is a worth while anime and is one that i would recommend to anyone either if they hadn't watched it or they are just getting into anime because it truly deserves to be number 1",10

                [Non-Spoiler Review]
I cried 4 times. And this isn't even a slice of life or romance anime. That's how I knew I couldn't rate it anything less than a 9. 
I had high hopes for this anime. It's highly regarded in the anime community and I thought, surely it couldn't be THAT good. And I was sorely mistaken. The first couple of episodes were somewhat slow for me. After the first one, I thought that this could get really good but lazily watched it at my own pace. And after episode 10, I was hooked through and through. I binged it so quickly. 
The characters are
                  the absolute highlight for me. I adored every single character. I have attachments with virtually ALL the characters, even ones that started off as villians. I couldn't believe how often I managed to cry. The art style of the characters made it that much easier, it actually hurt. And also, I really liked how at no point were the main protagonists (and even the side ones) unbeatable. They bled, they got hurt, they suffered the consequences of their actions. They stood right back up afterwards. As much as I love seeing fights where the MC's dominate, FMAB was a breath of fresh air in that aspect. I had no idea who was going to win, and what they had to lose as a result of winning. They weren't invincible. They were genuinely human... to an extent (iykyk).   
And the pacing is just right, not too slow or fast. I could get through an easy 15+ episodes without even thinking to pause. I never thought I'd rate something a 10/10 (though the ones I have, have been purely out of enjoyment, not taking everything into account). I 100% recommend watching this. 64 episodes never felt shorter, I was really skirting around my house avoiding finishing the last couple of episodes. 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is well worth the hype. The comedic relief, the emotional moments, the action, plot, everything. It was everything tied up in a really nice bow. I'm sad it's over but the ending didn't beg for more. I probably could've watched 50 more episodes of the aftermath.",10

                                         ******Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood Review********
First of all let me start off by telling, ""WOAH! What a kick-ass series this is!!"". This was my second time watching the series and let me tell you, the series just gets better and better as you keep repeating it and another thing to be noted is that this is far more better than the original FMA (you will eventually find out once you watch both the series).  
The story of FMA:Brotherhood is what other anime writers crave to develop but fail miserably, this being said I don't want to underestimate other worthy anime series out there.Law of Equivalent exchange was one of the major bases in the show and I must say that it was pretty much well executed by the series.The story progresses in a subtle way and has it's twist and turns, twists and turns which will probably blow your mind off.Overall, The story of two brothers who performed the ultimate taboo in alchemy; Human Transmutation go on a rugged and dangerous journey to get their bodies back and in the course of getting their bodies back they meet different people and face many obstacles is pretty well handled.Pretty Surprisingly, this series was able to include almost everything in it i.e action, comedy( the comic timing between the characters and the comedy was just awesome), emotion, drama, fantasy, etc 
The characters in this series are one of the best part of this series, The main characters of this series around whom the series is based are pretty well protrayed and the development of the characters is absolutely flawless. My favourite characters in the series were Winry rockbell and Edward Elric, their portrayal in the series was awesome. The worst character in the series must be Envy (OH god! Seriously Envy gave me creeps). Many other characters are introduced in the series here and there and their portrayal in the series was also fine.
The music and the soundtrack in this series was just freaking awesome. I can express in words how much I liked the OP and ED of this series, as each and every one of them tends to go with the flow of the series and all of them were able to grip my interest.The sound effects in the series is also good and enhances the viewing experience of the viewer during the series.
Overall, FMA:Brotherhood entertains viewer in each and every episode and leaves them at the edge of their seats with the sudden twists and turns in the episodes. Also, FMA:Brotherhood is far better than the original FMA as the story is better faced and the characters are portrayed better in this series. The series is also successful in portraying comedy, violence, fantasy, drama, emotions, etc in a managed manner. So, I recommend this anime to every person, and especially who are against anime as this anime will definitely change the view of such people. 
What are you waiting for? Just give it a try for heaven's sake.  I doubt you'll regret watching it.",10
"
                Its The King of all anime's. If someone is looking for a start in anime, he should start this one.
The story is unique and provides a thrill after every episode, something that not a lot of anime's can do.
It is also polished as compared to 2003 version. Some characters have been removed or added in order to make the story memorable.
The art style can still compare to modern day anime's.
Even though its 64 eps long, it still has the entertainment and thriller. You will never get bored. 
Summary: Edward and Alphonse Elric live in Resembool with their mother Trisha and father Van Hohenheim, the latter
                  having left without a reason. Trisha soon dies from an illness. After finishing their alchemy training under Izumi Curtis, the Elrics attempt to bring their mother back with alchemy. The transmutation backfires, and Edward loses his left leg while Alphonse loses his body. Edward sacrifices his right arm to retrieve Alphonse's soul, binding it to a suit of armor. Edward is invited by Roy Mustang to become a State Alchemist (to research a way to restore their bodies) and undergoes a painful medical procedure which grants him prosthetic automail limbs. Edward becomes a State Alchemist, with the title of Fullmetal Alchemist. The Elrics spend the next three years searching for the mythical Philosopher's Stone to achieve their goals.",10
"
                A concise and touching story that makes you feel fulfilled upon finishing it. With memorable characters, meaningful relationships, and powerful moments.  
Pros:
- Every line, every visual, and every character has a purpose to the overarching plot and that's what I enjoyed the most about it. It truly feels as if we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg as we watch, but the trust we put in the author is never betrayed as she constantly delivers and rewards us for our attention.
- The theme of family and friendship is not just 'portrayed', it feels genuine. The dynamics between the characters and their interactions have
                  a unique touch of realness to them and the banter between them is always a pleasure. 
- The comedy, even when it's out of place, is gold.
- Mustang and Hawkeye, both as individual characters and together, are absolutely amazing. Everything about them was well-written and they were my favorite part about this anime.
- The politics in this anime actually surprised me with its depth. Human atrocities is a subject lots of stories touch upon, but to start the story on the side of the people who committed these atrocities was a fresh perspective and it was told well. 
- The antagonists were a force to be reckoned with, and though some of them had an overwhelming and scary presence, lots of them felt like genuine human beings. The motivations of the villains were as powerful as the heroes'. Also, their plan for world domination ACTUALLY MADE SENSE. 
- Amazingly written female characters. The author of FMA proves that female characters don't need to be insanely powerful (though there certainly are insanely powerful women in FMA) to be taken seriously. 
Cons:
- The fight sequences just weren't good. I look back and think I've only enjoyed the fights where King Bradley was involved, which weren't many. The number of times Ed broke his automail and rendered useless during fights is ridiculous.
- The pacing was very slow in the beginning half of the story. I almost dropped it because, even though things were HAPPENING, they weren't happening at a pace which I enjoyed.
- Tons of build-up that often didn't pay off. The constant hyping up of characters and moments just to later be interrupted or ruined actually pissed me off. If I had a drinking game every time Edward made an empty threat, I would've been hospitalized. The number of times Alphonse or Greed were hyped up to be strong just to be easily defeated, was infuriating. 
- The character of Alphonse, while provided good emotional support and was the gentle counterpart to Ed, was useless in almost every fight he was in. As a 'fighter' he just... wouldn't DO MUCH. 
- A disappointing conclusion to the romantic relationships that the author put so much emphasis on. I felt cheated with the Winry 'hug', and more so when we didn't even get a conclusion to the Mustang and Hawkeye romantic subplot. 
Quotes:
""Life that has been lost cannot be brought back again. That very truth is what shows us the meaning and value of living."" - Roy Mustang 
""War does not determine who is right, only who is left."" -Riza Hawkeye
""Look straight at the people you kill; don't take your eyes off them for a second. And don't ever forget them because they won't forget you."" - Solf J. Kimblee",8
"
                I just have to say that the final is everything, the anime goes thru with some good phrases and scenes, but man the final got me crying. 
In some point I was not that in love with the characters but as they develop, you start to create some link with them, and I am going to say it again, when you see the last episode your heart cracks of joyness (I do not know how to explain it more precisely). 
All the phrases and things that are said in the last episode are meant to be written in our hearts, and al the scenes and
                  animations, everything is made the right way.
For me the last episode repair all the things that I thought were missing in this anime. 
JUST WATCH IT PLEASE.
FMA is a must watch for sure.",8
"
                A brilliant and well constructed story that follows the manga much more closely apart from the first few episodes.
There is an extremely good balance of humour and fantasy, as well as its spinechilling and downright sickening moments. But with also enough lulls in the storyline such that it's not incredibly action packed every episode.
The range of characters and their personalities are also very well balanced and contrasted against each other in the appropriate situations. Should it be military personnel providing a more serious atmosphere, to more rowdy/different characters such as Edward himself to provide a bit of humour.
Certainly, this is a must watch, and it's
                  hard not to be disappointed by this series.",10

                I don’t need to explain how good Fmab is. It is a perfect story and it never out does it’s welcome. It ends at the perfect place and is just amazing in every way. It is prob the best anime out there that I have seen. The way it transitions from place to place is incredible and so are the characters. Almost every character is likable in its own way and Edward is a great protagonist.The plot was so immaculent and it tells a perfect well rounded story that everyone deserves to watch. If you have anyone to watch it with i would also recommend
                  that. The relationships are so unique and real. The music and ost is also great and the art is really good and this was made more than a decade ago.

                Fmab is really perfect and balanced in each and every aspect whether it may it's story,art style,music,characters and the level of enjoyment. Below I have explained the main aspects that I personally like about Fmab 
(1)Story:The story is amazing and also the way it is structured is mind blowing and what I like most about Fmab is it's masterpiece storytelling layer after layer, it makes you engaged each and every second of it. It's just incredible how adventurous you feel when go through the journey of two brothers sometime you will feel the same feelings as of two brothers. The story is really a adventurous
                  masterpiece. Also it has set many benchmarks in the shounen genre. The adventurous story is the second main reason why I love Fmab so much. 
(2)Art style: Fmab is blessed with perfect word building. It's word building is as vibrant as it's characters. The word building perfectly sets with the main theme of Fmab.
(3)Characters: Well what's the speciality of Fmab and why do you need to watch?The answer to this question is characters. Introducing these much characters and giving them their own importance in the story and structure in only 64 episodes is just incredible. You will surely sympathize and like all the characters of Fmab whether it may protagonist or antagonist or side characters. Really characters of Fmab are unique in their own way who has their own importance in the story and are deeply connected to each other like a circle. The main reason why I love Fmab so much is it's characters",9

                *REVIEW FOR FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST: BROTHERHOOD*
Story (10/10):
In my opinion, FMA:B has one of the greatest stories of anime. Based in a fictional country within a law with its own physics rules (alchemy), the series successfully manages to keep the viewer wanting more and more episodes. This aspect is also completed by the main characters' goals (return to the original bodies and .... (here's a spoiler so nah)) 
Animation & Art (8/10):
The animation deserves a 7/10 but thanks to the beautiful art of the series, I think it deserves overall an 8/10 on this criterion. They knew how to add symbolism to the story, a very important
                  detail in my opinion. Also although the animation isn't great, the shots are amazing.
Sound, Voice Acting & Music (10/10):
Everything in this criterion is a 10/10. The soundtracks? Excellent. The voice acting? Great. The openings/endings? Legendary.
Character (10/10):
The characters are not well-built. They are ""legendary-built"". The character development is one of the things that will impress you regarding the character as you advance further in the story. There are also a lot of characters that from villains turn to heroes, and from heroes turn to villains, an interesting detail that you don't want to miss.
Overall, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an ABSOLUTELY must-watch for all anime enthusiasts. Although the first 10 episodes are weak, give it a try and I assure you the final quarter is LEGENDARY.
Recommendable only to anime enthuasists? : No.
Genre: Action, Drama, Adventure.",10

                This show is amazing, i love it from the bottom of my heart i do, it would receive a 9 on a scale out of 10 from me, the only limiting factors being i missed some of what would have been considered ""filler"" episodes that truly added to the story, and on rewatchability level. this could be considered my first rewatch and i dont have the same desire to go through it all again as i do for shows ive given a 10 to in the past. 
The story itself is one i find keeps me drawn into wanting to see more and find out
                  more about it, and its why i wish that they didnt remove the filler in a way. 
As for rewatching, it just seems that with where it was left it is like a good book that ends right where it should to keep you wanting more, and i dont think it does that in a bad way.",9

"
                This my first time writing a review but I felt the need to, so please go easy on me.
What I really wanted to say is the character so maybe you can skip to that for major criticism mainly on Roy Mustang.
Story 9/10
The story is great. First, it had a solid plot throughout the series. Ed and Al were trying to get their bodies back from the beginning and stayed true to their goal which is good. Some anime had a goal from the beginning but strays along the way or stopped mentioning about it until the end. FMAB does it every now and then. It
                  may sound repetitive but it reminds us what their objective is and what they are trying to do. 
The subplot I would consider to be the scheme of the empire and how it revolves around the alchemy and the fight for the philosopher's stone. It's like some pirates trying to get some treasure at the end of the journey but had issues along the way, which I would consider those issues as subplots. It was developed well throughout the series and well-concluded at the end. Since no spoilers are allowed I could not elaborate further but the subplot does intertwine well with Ed and Al's objectives.
The definition of alchemy in FMAB had a solid foundation. Alchemy could only be performed with equal values and the only interruption that could occur would be the use of philosopher's stone. There was no major power inflation which makes the characters insanely powerful. It thought this was a rare touch on a shounen anime. The elaboration between the 2 difference races, their vengeance, hatred and discrimination felt real to me. The terror of war as such was also well-mentioned in series. Learning to endure and forgive was a subplot too and served as an important message.  
The anime has just the right amount of story-telling, nothing too draggy nor lacking. However, some episodes I felt doesn't link well with the next episode. I felt some were rushed through at certain points. For example, one of them was the time-skip. Most shounen animes have time-skips FMAB had it too. However the previous episode showed Al in a certain place then the next it jumped right into the time-skip which I felt awkward. And the separation of a certain character who was together felt like it jumped out of nowhere. It was never explained why they decided to move to those certain places after the time-skip. So it is a 9.
Art 10/10
I thought the art was great for the year. Art style is a matter of personal preference. I thought the art style was good and since there were no major distortion in the art I thought I would give it a pretty high score. There were some good use of chibi characters and good battle effects and movement. It is rather promising if you look at the year of release. Overall, I enjoyed the art, the flashiness and the character art design and had some characters design which I find cool and adorable so I gave it 10/10 out of my level of satisfaction.
Sound 10/10
Good use of sound. All the OPs and EDs were fantastic. I love them all. Some episodes had the EDs cut into the ending scene which I believe was a good use. It gave me goosebumps. I am loose on battle sound effects, as long as it doesn't feel awkward it is fine. So overall 10.
Character 5/10
Characters. This portion is where I had the biggest problem with. I wish I could elaborate on each character but I think I will just focus on Winry and Roy Mustang(along with Kimblee, Hawkeye, Armstrong, Hughes for comparison)
Before I start on those 2 I mentioned, I need to mention that some characters that later joined the crew felt rather unnecessary. Because IMO I think they could be replaced by basically anyone. No background stories no particular connections, it was like they were just there to help out with the last boss because they desperately needed people. I didn't mind but they felt random to me. For example, Dr. Marcoh was there for a reason, Scar was, Winry was the mech, The Xings had a reason etc but those were not the same. So I was perplexed.  
Winry. I felt like she was just a plot device rather than a character. Her change of perspective and resolve were too sudden. Winry was there because the brothers needed her support, she was Edward's weakness, she needed the interaction with Scar for the plot etc. I needed to see more of her struggle, how she overcome the barrier after knowing the truth. I believe Scar was influenced by Winry and maybe the accompany of the little girl and mustache, but Scar's objective was to wipe out all state alchemists regardless whether they are children or adults. What happened to that? Scar was even threatening to kill Winry early in the series. I needed to see the struggle and more interaction between the 2.
I am going to bash on Roy Mustang so proceed with caution.
Roy Mustang. How and where should I start without spoiling. As a general knowledge, the military took part in genocide of Ishval before the start of the show. I am totally fine with that as a story. Most of the people that were important had their personal thoughts and views with regard to their participation in the war. But Roy had close to none, which makes me feel that he is lacking in his character development. 
If you look at Kimblee, he was someone who enjoyed massacre and enjoyed his moments in his war. I think it was justified because he was portrayed as someone who enjoys annihilation of Ishvalan and I am totally fine with his characterization. I don't hate him just because he's a villain. He was alright as a character.
Armstrong, he was a coward during the war. Armstrong did both the right and wrong things in the war. He escaped after seeing children/civilians getting killed. This might look biased because I think Armstrong was a morally righteous person who chose to escape. However it was also a wrong thing to do as a soldier. But because of that I got to know his character better at that point so I was fine.
The problems with Roy Mustang I believed would be his view on Ishval, how he reacted after the war. How he felt towards the people he killed. How he felt with using his alchemy despite being told not to get the flame alchemy. I know Roy had a resolve, he wanted to stand at the top so that he can change the country. But that decision does not link well with his action in the genocide of Ishval. The best comparison I could use here would be Hawkeye. Hawkeye participated in the war. She wanted to make the country better so she joined the military but ended up killing people. She showed her resentment so she asked Roy to do something to her which I could not say here. She even spoke her mind out when chatting with Edward regarding the issue and was able to show her emotions to Scar. But Roy lacked that. Maybe I could say the resentment phase. Without that it makes me think that he would go on burning people again even if it was needed to make the Ishvalan better. This confirmed my belief because the last episode showed exactly how he can ruthlessly use something gotten during the massacre in order to achieve his goal. He knew that his flame alchemy had done atrocious deeds. They at least need to show him hesitating in using his flame etc. He was so unethical in his last choice in the last episode. Think of the people you sacrificed. Think of your families who were sacrificed and getting used. If Roy was written as a cunning villain or a brainless dude who just follows orders I think he has a justified characterization. But I try to believe Roy was meant to be a righteous person and decisive character at heart, but the anime failed to show that in my opinion. 
The people were saying he was forced I mean the Ishvalans were forced after tying them up. The lost souls were forced to be used. ""I will use the souls I brutally killed"" sounds nice to you? Besides he could do it even in that condition. If the anime showed reasons like say you cannot become the Fuhrer if you are in that condition then maybe he would have no choice but at least he should seek the permission of the Ishvalans first, asking them if he could use the souls of their families sisters brothers mothers fathers friends. After all he is still a war criminal.
The relationship between Roy and Hughes were rather good. Roy showed how he felt with Hughes' situation yet no elaboration on Ishval's case. 
BTW I have read the manga and I must say I liked Roy Mustang much more than the anime. I didn't know why they changed in the anime. I didn't like the anime version of Roy Mustang.
Enjoyment 8/10
I still loved the series. I was touched and teared up a little too. The journey was promising and the fights were alright. If you compare with the recent works done by the same studio, not too flashy but I still enjoyed the sword fights and the use of alchemy, gun shots and their brain power. Moreover, the plot was great and I enjoyed it a lot.",8
"
                A re-styling of Fullmetal Alchemist with crisper animation, more plot, more logical storylines, and better backstory, Brotherhood follows the plot of the manga more closely, giving Ed and Al's father more of a role. And I think most of the voice actors returned, which is great, because Ed and Al are perfect. If you're going to watch just one, watch this one.

                Just one word - Masterpiece !!!!!!!!!!!
This is my first review , please tell me if i lack anything -
FMAB deserves the praise it gets , most importantly people compare it with other animes and tend to say FMAB lacks this but in my opinion its just perfect . 
First time i felt attach to so many characters , it was awesome not a single episode bored me.
If you are confused to watch it or not , i mean cmon man there shouldn't be option for skipping this legendary anime.
The osts are amazing , badass characters like roy mustang. Our man Edward isn't the strongest but
                  one of the best MCs.
FMAB will forever be in my heart.",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is really a testament to the original work of the manga. Although the details from the beginning of the series were omitted (these episodes are covered in Fullmetal Alchemist 2003) in all other respects, it is a faithful retelling of Hiromu Arakawa's work. 
The story has a rich cast of characters whose lives become increasing interwoven with the journey of Edward and Alphonse. The story is incredibly cohesive and many of the characters introduced throughout the series remain relevant and actively play a role in the final climax of the plot, which I find particularly impressive. 
There is a lot of depth
                  to each of the characters and the anime does a good job of accurately portraying their quirks and motivations throughout the series. The animators make it possible for you to deeply sympathize with the characters and makes the impacts of the themes of justice, determination, and perseverance even more stark and relatable. You can especially see Alphonse and Ed go through a lot of character development as you visibly see them grow up through the series.
The action scenes are very well choreographed, and the art style is very classic in my opinion and has aged well. The opening and ending themes were fitting and well animated as well. 
In Summary: The story and characters are really what make this anime shine and a favorite of many throughout the years. This is definitely worth a watch if you enjoyed the manga or even if you haven't read the manga, this anime is outstanding on its own.",10
"
                This show, I dont even know where to begin with it. Wow. Just, wow. 
Very few shows would I rate a 10, in fact as of right now, this is the only one that qualifies in my mind. Whether it really is the perfect show doesn't really matter because it is to me.
I first watched Fullmetal two years ago and I was struck by a colourful cast of characters, an intriguing story and a crippling anime addiction. The pacing is incredible, the romance is believable, and doesn't get in the way of the storytelling. I don't cry much, especially not for background characters, but when
                  I tell you I cried watching this show I CRIED. (In a good way of course!) 
Another thing I love is the small details sprinked throughout the show, some that I hadn't even noticed until the second time through.
In conclusion: WATCH THIS SHOW. DO IT.",10
"
                Did you know, i had to try 3 times to finish this anime. First 2 times, i dropped it cause it was too dark. But after half graduating from anime i became determined to finish this and i finally did.
This anime is a masterpiece and i knew that from the start cause of the ratings.
Firstly, the characters, the mc Elric brothers are perfect characters. Their traits, reactions, actions, emotions everything is enjoyable. Other characters have all unique traits and with enough depth except the main villain the father. He seemed somewhat under delivered. No! It's not cause of him severing his 7 emotions, he is
                  still plain boring but his 7 emotions are good though, just the combined person is meh.
The plot is about the villain, wanting to become god by serving all his emotions and his slave who was somewhat villain's creation wanting to stop him. Alchemy, equivalent exchange, Philosophers stone and you can already imagine the rest. Then comes the MC Elrick brothers who really seen hell on earth because of their immaturity and had to learn everything the hard way. Amidst long term planning, between two sides, the mc has their adventure to search for their beliefs. Various variable comes to play in between.
The art is old even though it's a remake. But, still no complains there cause it matches the anime setting. Sound is good throughout the anime except poor opening and ending themes, which i hardly  care about.
I watched 1500-2000 series in this oriental fiction industry so it's not easy to move me but watching Early Elric hell and that chimera girl left a bad taste in my mouth. Making a a 25 year old veteran have change of feeling means the anime is successful. The comedy was enjoyable throughout the journey. The early part was 10/10 the finishing became somewhat mild because of veteran experience. I had to skip and drag a lot which i really didn't want to but had to. The story overall was perfect. All dots are connected. Only flaw was Edward's last action of sacrificing his knowledge for his arm. It felt like Deus ex machina, they could've done it differently. I enjoyed it even though this experience would've multiplied if i watched it when i started my anime journey. Well, it can't be helped cause the anime is too dark at the start even though it becomes normal as the story progresses.
I give it a solid 9 overall and i recommend this to everyone of course",9

                So the most popular, ""Number One""-Anime on this site can't possibly be bad, right? Well fear not, this is not meant to be contrarian or going against the masses for the sake of being cool or simply different, no. I can wholeheartedly support the notion that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is nothing short of a fantastic show. Really, the only goal this review has, for me personally, is to find out whether it's really great or even a masterpiece. You see, since i always make up these reviews as i go, i am not really sure myself ate the start. But let's take a look:
Story: The
                  story is outstanding, let me get this out of the way first. It's such a carefully crafted plot, with all the foreshadowing that a story of this kind carries around. However, it is always a little subtle, so that you can only really spot it on a rewatch. That said, the story is also rather straightforward, it's nothing to crazy or outlandish, all the concepts seem to be grounded in this world, that's not that different from ours, except that some people are capable of using a kind of magic called ""Alchemy"". It gets a little crazy towards the end, but even that is always established throughout the show, always in the back of the head of the Elric Brothers and the viewer. It deals with some heavy themes, the loss of loved ones, the desperate desire to bring them back, the punishment for ones naive sins and how to deal with it, how to bear it or maybe fight it and to protect the people that still remain. Also, to bring it down the basics: what it means to be human. While it has some truly tragic scenes, enough to make you shed some tears, certainly, there is also just a lot of fun. Really,the story is able to invoke the whole range of emotions, something that is always tough, or even nigh impossible, to do.
Art: Something the art in this show really manages to capture is facial expressions, especially for Edward. When his eyes go wide because he saw something horrible or if he is angry, simply by being called out on his height, the drawings always capture his emotions perfectly. But the same goes for other characters, Roy Mustang, Armstrong and Hohenheim and even Alphonse,fascinating enough. He doesn't even have a face, but just the way his eyes get smaller or just completely go dark, you always get a idea how he might feel in a moment. I gotta say though, not a huge fan of the art style. It looks nice, certainly, it's still pretty good, but it's just a little too basic to me. It' kinda hard to express what i mean, but i just really like stuff that goes a little off the rails. In contrast to that, FMA:B goes a more realistic route and that is okay, it's something a can like, but not completely love. Some of the character designs are a little silly, mostly in the Homunculus-department, but then some are absolutely brilliant, even if a huge chunk of the characters wear the same uniform. Not that this is a problem, the blue looks pretty sharp. So the art is overall very good, even if it seemed like i had a lot of qualms with it. I didn't, i blew it out of proportion, just a tad.
Sound: Something that really stands out here is the voice acting, that is some real quality. Romi Park does such an amazing job as the lead role and she is pretty much the whole reason i could never watch this show dubbed, even if always hear good things about the english voice work. I mention her specifically, but the whole cast is actually amazing, without fail really. Then again, i don't actually know japanese, so it's hard for me to spot a bad actor, i suppose. To my amateur-ears, it all sounded great. And then there is the habit of some great Ending-transitions. They are so memorable and always so brilliantly timed that they really make for the best scenes. Especially the door-scene, that might be my favorite in the whole show. The Soundtrack is nice as well, especially the main theme, always brings a tear to my eye. I just wouldn't listen to it separately. There are also a lot of openings and endings and they all range from pretty good to great. My personal favorite might still be the first opening, but over the rewatch i also grew fond of ""Golden Time Lover"". The sound receives a final verdict of great.
Characters: This section, in tandem with the story might be the best part of the show. The main characters are great, the side characters too, the villains as well, i guess you can see where this is going. They all have their struggles and motivations, even if for some the motivation is simply:""Father says so."" Even that works, simply because the cast is so massive that you really get all kinds of characters. At the same time, however, the how manages to avoid all the common tropes. Yes, Edward is a bit of a hotheaded shonen-protagonist, but at the same time, he is a straight-up genius, levelheaded as soon as he actually enters the fight his short temper brought him into. They are many examples of that, but that's something everyone should discover for themselves, how much there actually is to the characters. Just want to say that you won't find your twintail-tsundere or your dandere with some shade of blue in her hair. Not to say that i don't enjoy these archetypes, but if your fed up with more of the same, Brotherhood delivers something different. That alone wouldn't be enough for outstanding Characters, but again, i won't say too much, only that there is a lot of depth and development.   
Enjoyment: In 64 Episodes, i was never bored or had the urge to check the time on an episode. That is truly amazing, some regular 12 episode anime don't manage that. So what else could i say to prove my enjoyment? That the adventures of the Fullmetal Alchemist Alphonse Elric and his little assistant threw me through all the emotions i already mentioned. The pacing is always perfect too and the payoff for some of the slower segments is outstanding. So this will be the score for my enjoyment, i loved it, not every episode, but i at least liked them all.
So in the end, it only barely misses the ten and i think that's okay. Fullmetal Alchemist is something anyone can enjoy and i wouldn't judge you if you said it's your favorite anime of all time. For me, however, it's a little too grounded. I mentioned this before, but i prefer something a teeny bit more complicated. Really, only a small margin, cause this show is pretty complex too. Does it help if i mention that my favorite anime is either Monogatari or Madoka? Yeah, i am one of those people... . But there you have it, a great anime with pretty much everything you cold ever want, stellar animation, a good story with a nice ending and a whole bunch of likeable and complex characters. This is why we watch anime, right? I certainly do.",9

--The review contains spoilers--
So my review is based on recent rewatch. Used to give this anime a 9-10 given how good the story is for its time. Animation as well. This review really stems from my recent discussion on how I used to feel attack on titan being similar to FMA. But it just made me grow less fond of FMA after further comparison.
Art 7/10
I know its not fair because this was done in 2009. But I felt the arts tone sometimes felt inconsistent. Biggest example is when Ed was showing anguish after confronting Shou Tucker. It was supposed to be a serious moment yet
                  the art made it look comical, but I'm not really bumping it down for that.
Story 8.5/10
Its still a good story with amazing revelations. However they removed so much from the manga causing some very odd pacing. I did not realize this before and simply enjoyed it. Dublith arc is an example of this with no build up to Bradley appearing in South. Like why? In the manga it was much better, with also a clear reason why Bradley knows where Greed was. Another complaint is the gags. The first time I watched it I had no issues, but now I feel it drags the pacing of the story a lot. It also makes it hard to appreciate the dark undertones of the story. I again did not realize this problem before. Only after watching AoT do I get to appreciate the lack of humor. Additionally, felt that the first season had lots of fillers that dragged the story a lot, second season was when the story improves. 
Also I realized a big problem. The beginning of the series, its hard to relate to the brothers other than to he sad for them. But I mean they really want to get their body back, but the urgency isn't there. It had a weaker start.
Characters 7/10
Used to appreciate Edward Elric and Roy Mustang more. But I feel FMA has a large cast with some of them not really essential to the plot. Thus reducing screen time for some of these characters. Hughes and Havoc to me was not developed as good as I expected.",8
"
                Wow, what an anime. Before I get into my full review I have to admit that I've actually dropped this show before. I guess I could blame onto life getting in the way, so when everything was settled I decided to restart from the beginning and honestly I couldn't have made a better decision. Another confession, I haven't watched the 2003 FMA and I probably won't. I've already seen this version and would much rather spend my time watching a fresh new anime.
I was recommended FMA: Brotherhood by a random website. For those you that don't know, I've watched some anime's in the past but
                  never really got deep into the lifestyle. So I decided to do myself a favor and search some anime's a beginner should watch and from the endless lists I decided to start at FMA: Brotherhood. The only problem now is that the other anime's might not hold up.
Where do I even start? 
Story  8/10
I'm guessing everyone has read the synopsis and I'm not allowed to spoil much but story is really good. Unlike some other anime's I've seen, such as Bleach, there aren't filler episodes. The viewer just progresses forward without the plot stopping to catch up with the manga artist. There aren't any plot holes, well not any in my opinion. (I am just a beginner.) The plot twists are also very good, I learned my lesson not to trust everyone and to not judge someone too quickly.
Art & Sound 7/10
My rating might be a little biased because of my naivety but Brotherhood's artwork is good. What really draws you in are the fight scenes. Sound is good as well, I really liked the third opening. It's the only one I've saved to my playlist.
Character  8/10
The characters are very rich. Most of them are nicely fleshed out and each time a major death happens it tugs at your heart. The creators did a good job of having the viewers connect with the characters that when we lose them it's hard to see them go. 
Enjoyment  10/10
It's so obvious that I really, really enjoyed this show. Definitely in my top 5 now.",9
"
                I will be plan and simple, this anime is perfect, it was the only series that fully attended what a want in the genre of shounen, it redefines the genre, refines existing elements and creates and many new ones, the story goes and ends with everything solved and the whole plot is connected, the author had the whole story on his mind so there he could finished it without having the trouble of ""forgetting"" or missing something out, i watched it last year, please make yourself a favor and what it NOW. 
And btw, Mustang X Riza will always be my OTP, and i am
                  not even a romance fan. And also, the comedy on this anime is on another leve, fun but not dumb whille being intelligent but no boring, fucking masterpiece.",10
"
                Brilliant. Absolutely -BRILLIANT-.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is meant to be a more faithful re-telling of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, where the original anime deviated greatly from the original material's story. I must say, they hit the mark spot on. The greater amount of humor that existed in the manga is here, but also the darker story elements are also there, creating a huge contrast from the original anime.
The art is amazing, using the colors and tones from the manga adds a nice visual difference that sets it apart from the original series.
All the same characters are back, and I am especially happy that they used the
                  exact same voice cast for the english dub as the original FMA anime series, this is a HUGE thumbs up to Funimation.
Overall, FMA: Brotherhood is a GREAT retelling of the series from the manga's storyline. You do not have to read the manga or watch the original FMA anime series to follow Brotherhood, but I recommend the original series as well as it was a nicely done anime, despite it's let-down ending.",10

                Unlike the 2003 adaptation, Brotherhood is a faithful representation of Arakawa Hiromu's manga.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is starting at a breakneck pace. However, once you get used to it, the pacing feels very appropriate for the series and only seems to increase the suspense. Brotherhood always manages to switch between serious and comedy. Interestingly, one of the greatest advantages of Brotherhood is actually its wealth of interesting characters. The original FMA focused primarily on the two main characters and their efforts to regain their bodies, while Brotherhood also explores other characters in great detail at the same time.
One of the many good things about this series
                  is that there is no infill at all (yes, I'm thinking of Naruto etc), which keeps the story from losing momentum. All the episodes are concise and each scene is important as part of the huge main story.
The art is in a different style, a bit simpler, but that's not a bad thing. What is lacking in detail, it makes up for with some premier fight sequences. The animation is generally very neat and the movements of the characters are very fluid and natural.
The voice acting is excellent and consistent, and I think pretty much all of the characters have voice actors to suit their personalities. With such a cast of actors, you wouldn't expect less. Most opening / ending are fun to listen to.
You'd be hard pressed to find a shonen anime that will entertain you as much as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Really good anime, there is no other way to describe it. A must have for newcomers to anime and hardened otakus.",9

                The story of FMA:B is just brilliant. It follows two storyline routes; the first one is the supernatural route, which include everything about alchemy and its magic!!! 
The second route is the military aspect of the show which is amazing too.
The main protagonists mostly deal with the problems in the alchemy section but a lot of good characters are in the military part of the story (Hint: King Bradly).
The artwork was great and the soundtrack is just beautiful!!
One thing I didn't like is Winry's part of the story, she is so annoying and adds nothing to the story in my opinion, even the little story
                  about her parents and Scar didn't seem to have any meaning or importance to the overall story.
At the end, till this day nothing I have watched beats FMA: Brotherhood, maybe Bioshock games if just they were an anime.",10
"
                Everything about this anime is amazing. I watched the original FMA and absolutely loved it, I had no knowledge of the manga, and was just watching it for the pleasure of it, not the manga or something else.  FMA was hands down the best anime I had ever seen, up there with Cowboy Bebop and the like.  I didn't pirate it, I purchased the DVD sets because they were so good that they sure as hell deserved my money for the great work they did.  I started out watching Brotherhood with the preconception that the differences were ""Brotherhood is more lighthearted"" and
                  ""Brotherhood splits off in story at episode 14"".  Those were my only preconceptions.  I'll admit, the first 10 or so episodes had wayyyy more anime faces and sillyness than I'd ever seen in FMA before, but I got used to it, because I was persistent in the fact that it had a completely different take on the FMA universe and I really wanted to experience it again.  Once it hit around episode 20, it started getting darker and more brutal, like the old FMA, which was something I preferred.  The character development and background stories were SOOOOO detailed and fleshed out that I was blown away at how much of the characters I didn't understand or know before.  There were just so many incredible details and little tidbits that I NEVER knew and it just blew me away to hear it and wonder why I never heard it or was aware of it before.  The story was amazing, it was so twist-y, addicting, and cliffhanger-y.  This is the most addicting show I've ever watched, I sat down and watched 12 episodes one day.  That's 12 x 20 minutes = 240 minutes of Brotherhood straight in ONE sitting.  I've never been so enthralled and involved in any anime or visual entertainment of ANY kind.  I don't want to write a wall of text, because I could, but FMAB takes the awesome FMA series (which I didn't think could get any better), improves absolutely EVERYTHING, and blows the doors off of any anime I've ever seen in my entire life.  To quote what I said to one of my best friends about the anime after finishing it: ""I can wholeheartedly say it is honestly the best thing I've ever seen in any art form or medium of entertainment in my entire life ever.""  It's a bold f***ing statement, but I've never been so taken by anything like Brotherhood.",10
"
                One is all and all is one. equivalent exchange. war and peace. the seven sins. God and truth. all of these alchemic and philosophical concepts are applicable to daily life and are depicted here. An anime without a single flaw imo. Incredible buildup to an epic conclusion where everything and everyone is connected. The character development of every character is truly phenomenal.
It’s a quintessential story about humanity.
I see now why it's heralded as the best anime in the last two decades. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to check anime out. Don't miss it!! Watch it!! I can't highly recommend it enough.

                NO SPOILER REVIEW
Here is a review coming from a young audience, not affected by nostalgia that typically prefers modern anime over old ones. 
To keep things short, my overall opinion after seeing this anime is that it's good, but, I do not appreciate the fact that the build-up was very long and that it wasn't that good. The pacing killed me halfway through, nearly falling asleep. The reason this anime is so appreciated is because it is long and complex. There were plenty of episodes to build a world from scratch. There were a lot of details and the anime payed attention to them. There
                  are a lot of characters meant to represent your average people, that slowly appear into the life of two people, thus making them grow. But these people I'm talking in fact were very boring to watch. The interesting parts came in sets, separated by 10ish episode gaps.
I do appreciate it not being your average shonen, the MC is not powerful at all and the struggle is very hard. The MC grows in power from experience and from nothing else. The anime successfully gives you the feeling of a loss but 
I absolutely disliked the music of this anime because it is old. Can't complain too much, it was made in 2009, however in this review I'm sharing my impression. The animation wasn't that good either, the transitions between frames was slow, fights lack the punch (being nothing to what Shippuden offered for example).
The anime starts low, gets really interesting for a few episodes (20-25 I believe), then falls into that slow pacing up until the last 10 episodes being the climax. 
I don't think this anime deserves this spot on this site. It's ratings are way too high, I'm not saying it's bad but it's overrated. People got too emotionally affected by the ending (which indeed is really good) but forgot how boring it was to get there. There are also a lot of people affected by nostalgia or just old school FMA fans that were proud to see a remake of the original series.
STORY: 10/10
The story is amazing. Complex, a lot of plot twists, a lot of things make sense and it feels realistic (in a way of reality mixing with fantasy, not just pure fantasy). There was a lot of room for chaos and it was a long and hard ride. A lot of amazing details were shown in this anime, something the new ones fail to deliver. I don't think there is anybody in this world that won't enjoy this story.
ART: 8/10
It is an older anime but I still didn't get their art style at all. The eyes are poorly placed, most are too big, and some character's hair are just...yikes. Now I'm reviewing the anime, not the art style chosen by the manga writer, however the anime was supposed to make them a bit more pleasant to watch. I think they did an OK job overall.
SOUND: 7/10
The music has to be the shittiest part of this anime. There is a cycle of sounds played depending on the arc, the problem is it's very very very very repetitive. And it doesn't move you at all. It's just that music you find in old movies overused in most scenarios that try to move your soul a bit but they make you cringe. That's how it is. You'll get to a point where you'll be able to predict what song will come according to the scene.
CHARACTER: 9/10
I liked most characters because they covered the typical types of people you find around you. They were made realistically. None of them spit shit out of their mouths. You'll relate to what most normal humans would say. About their behavior, the main 2 protagonists start from scratch and although they don't suddenly get stronger they do change their decision making and perspective as time passes, this is the process of growing up. The supporting characters overall are good but there are some that simply make you wanna punch them, being good and suddenly becoming bad just to ""shake things"" up. 
ENJOYMENT: 8/10
In the ""interesting"" parts I just couldn't stop watching but in the build up episodes they simply made me drowsy or made me wanna check my phone just to change the panorama a bit. I had mixed feelings overall.
OVERALL: 8/10
It is a good anime and I cannot deny it, but again, I do not and I will never really see it as the number #1 anime rated by this site. IMO there are better anime out there worth this spot.",8
"
                I just finished the series and it was quite good but as you can probably tell from my rating this review isn't going to be all praises. 
I'll start with the comedy. Don't get me wrong, I also giggle at comedic relief when done right but they used dumb humour so repetitively during the first 10 episodes I almost quit watching. It's a shame because these earlier episodes usually had serious philosophical undertones but the show kept bailing out with jokes and those godawful animation switches. Given the story's dark and serious nature, the humor just felt out of place. It seemed like the show
                  doesn't take itself seriously and isn't worth my time but I endured for a few more episodes and I'm glad I did.
As the story progressed the brat MC became less bratty and the cute armor-clad brother didn't bring up his foodlist as often. But more importantly they got less screen time! Soon it was apparent that this isn't just a show about two brothers but something bigger. With the spotlight being shared more and more by various side characters, the show revealed its strength.
It took only 46 episodes to create a living, immersive world with a ridiculous amount of characters I'm heavily invested in. I enjoyed the pacing of the conspiracy reveal and I found myself breezing through the episodes. As I learned more about the rough FMA:B world, I also began to appreciate the brothers' childish behaviour and their struggle.
Other than that, the action scenes were well done throughout the show and only got better during the final act. I didn't love or hate the soundtrack, I thought it was mediocre (except Trisha's Lullaby <3). The animation was impressive for the most part but I wasn't a fan of the switches to ""chibi"". 
Overall, I think FMA:B is very good (8) but not the masterpiece it's made out to be. If you decide to watch it don't quit early, it gets better!",8
"
                Story: Edward and Alphonse Elric's careless behavior towards the fundamental's of Alchemy law, have ripped away at Edward's limbs and Left Al's soul being sealed into a cold suit of armor.  To get back what was lost, the brother's look through a war-torn land for the philosopher's stone, A fabled relic which grants the ability to perform alchemy in impossible way's. 
Animation: The animation was perfect! Then again, what else would you expect from Aniplex? The same studio that animated title's such as Demonslayer, Fate/Stay Night, and Angel Beats! Aniplex is a powerhouse when it comes to the production of not only anime, but
                  Music and Anime merch as well. It's no wonder at times, their limited edition boxsets are priced at ridiculous prices, but That's to be expected. 
Intro/Outro: The Intro/Outro tracks are forever remember by anime fans around the world, as everything about the Intros and Outros were amazing! "" Again "" by Yui, "" Rain "" by Sid and Let's not forget the Outro's like "" Uso "" by Sid, "" Tsunai Da Te "" by Lil'B are all amazing! From Metal to Rock, and Rap, FMAB has it all and The animation done within the Intros and Outros, compliment the animation within the anime as well. 
Character Development: Character development is done correctly within this anime, as it followed on the manga path compared to the 2003 Iteration of FMA, as it did not. Everything about the character's felt correct and Nothing was changed, as it was all original to the manga.  
Personal Enjoyment: I enjoyed watching FMAB to the point I've seen it four or five times already and I can still watch it over and over again, which may sound crazy, but To understand this masterpiece, you would literally have to see the difference between FMA and FMAB, there are even fans still fighting about which is better to this very day and It just goes to show you how popular this anime series was. I once use to think DBZ was the best anime of all time, but As I grew away from the casual aspect of anime and Became more knowledgeable of anime and It's overall production I had decided by that time, that FMAB was better than DBZ.   
Overall Score: The overall score for Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood? 10/10 - PERFECTION!!!!!
Final Verdict: Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood will always remain a staple in anime history and Will always be considered The GOAT of Anime aka Greatest Anime of All Time! The animation, The amazing Intro's/Outro's, The character development, and Overall enjoyment I got from this anime is just another reason why I can make this statement and I'm pretty sure all of MAL aka My Anime List would agree with me. 
Side Note: Sorry my reviews have been a bit slow, but Working from 6am-7pm has got me busy like New York traffic and Has me feeling sleepy at times, there is also the fact that I stream from 8pm to 12pm now  and That my Anime/Gaming channels on YouTube also take time away from my reviews, but As soon as I get my 50 followers on Twitch I should be able to earn some money here and There and Hopefully with enough followers and Viewers I can quit my job and Entertain my fans from Amino, MAL, and Overall my Social Media, regardless I thank you all for reading my reviews and I greatly appreciate it. LMK if I should review anything else and In the mean time I'm gonna catch some ZZZ's cause it is 2am as of now and I am feeling somewhat sleepy Z.Z Until next time I guess ✌😂",10

                The character growth is not only evident in their behavior, but also visually as they literally grow up, which is not something that anime/manga, and especially shonen, usually bothers with outside of timeskips, but in FMA:B, you can see it happening in real time.
The characters are all unique, charming, and engaging in their own way, to the point that you could literally just read some lines with no context or voice and you could know who it is, and I'm not just talking about Ed's vendetta against milk.
The OPs and ED's are all perfect at their job, which is to communicate the tone and content
                  of their respective arcs. The first and second ones are more lighthearted with only a little bit of a hint of danger, especially when you know the lyrics, and from there, each new OP becomes more and more serious and dark, until you get to Rain, which is just absolutely flawless in its music and visual elements.
The story itself is also incredible. Usually, you'll get a story that's either character-driven or plot-driven, but this one somehow does both and does it in an incredibly organic way such that you are absolutely 100% invested in what's going on, be it the overall stakes, the emotional growth of the characters, or the action in the moment. The information is drip-fed to us. There's not a single exposition dump anywhere that it couldn't be done fluidly by character interaction. Flashbacks are few and far between and last only long enough to convey what information they need to.
And overall, even as the stakes keep escalating, from the boys to the country to the world, it's still just about the boys getting their bodies back.
And that's why Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets a 9/10 and ties for my favorite. It's closer to a 10 than an 8.",9
"
                FMAB is the type of show that makes the viewer think due to its insights about topics ranging from religion and power to life and insecurities all whilst keeping a firm ground in its gripping plot and relatable characters (which should always come first unless a show is making a point about doing otherwise). If you couldn't tell from that run-on, I really love this show and have thus decided to make it my first subject of review on this site (so bear with me :3). Here we go...
Story - 10: Fullmetal's story is truly what binds all the otherwise enjoyable aspects of the show
                  into one of the most celebrated works in all anime. The brothers come from a place of hurt and vulnerability, as revealed with their backstory, and find themselves thrust into a well-developed world in an effort to find the Philosopher's Stone. While this may seem cliche, particularly in comparison with popular shonen titles, this is far more than a couple kids with a dream and a documentation of the overcoming of the obstacles to that dream. Behind the seemingly simple quest for the Stone is a much grander scheme by the secret puppet-masters of the government. One of the most compelling aspects of watching FMAB in its entirety is seeing how the Stone is integrated with this scheme, and how they get more intertwined as more is revealed about the plot and characters. I credit this toward the story's brilliant pacing, which honestly came across as the most impressive part of the show's writing my first time through. Each episode leaves you wanting to see and know more of the world and plot, all the while careful as to how much information is revealed each episode. By the time the final episode is up everything is revealed and wrapped up neatly, which is an impressive feat for a show that has so damn much going on. Overall, I think the story is as good as it could've been, and I felt very satisfied with spending my time watching it unfold.
Art - 8: Considering there were six years in between the original FMA adaptation and the show I'm reviewing now, it comes as no surprise that FMAB is a definite upgrade in animation. The fight sequences as well as character expressions and movements are considerably more fluid than the original, adding in a lot of ways to the depth of the characters. This change especially benefits the emotional scenes, which rely on this expressiveness and emotion that the improved animation adds to truly get across to the audience. The original FMA fell considerably flat in this category and I think it may be one of the core reasons as to why Brotherhood simply comes across as better to so many people, since the emotions and resolves of the characters are one of the primary appeals of the show. That being said, a possible complaint one might have with the art is that everything is animated the same; in other words, none of the villains or homonculi really comes across as menacing for their animation (except Gluttony), but rather their design. This may cause the viewer to get a tad bored after a while, but there is good reason that the world is drawn in this way, which is consistency; for a show that bases so much of its appeal in being consistent in as many realms as possible, a consistent art style that doesn't surprise or astound but does what it needs to could not be more fitting. With all this in mind, FMAB's art is good-looking and solid, but knows that is not the show's centerpiece, and thus tries to do no such thing.
Sound - 7: The soundtrack of Brotherhood is not the greatest addition to the story as I've seen other shows do, but is still very solid. While suspense is especially present in the lineup, the music covers an array of emotions that is diverse and are placed accordingly with the events of the show, as a soundtrack should. The only real complaint I have about it is the repetition that becomes frankly noticeable during the middle chunk of the show. During these episodes, the suspenseful violin track is used virtually every episode whenever something important is about to happen, which began to get on my nerves after a while. However, the final battle in Central as well as the episodes leading up to it do a great job in varying the tracks way more, and I'm pretty sure some new ones are used as well. This significantly adds to the momentum of this long sequence of ending events, and pretty much makes up for the slight repetitiveness of episodes prior to it. Besides the soundtrack, the voice acting was great, especially the homonculi, who all had voices that fit them perfectly. Aside from them, all of the cast work really well together, particularly Romi Park, who brought both Edward's obnoxious/stubborn and sensitive sides to life.
Characters - 10: The characters of FMAB are well-loved (Edward is one of the most liked characters on MAL) and for a reason. Our main cast consists of characters who have relatable personal darknesses and insecurities, but also who have a lot of heart. The brothers, while haunted by their past, have placed each others' lives in their hands, and will do anything to protect one another. While this is the most outward display of caring between characters, there are also instances such as Mustang and Hawkeye, who put faith in each other despite the dark experiences they had in Ishvala. However, sympathy is not the only thing the cast must draw out of the viewer; they must also entertain, and Brotherhood is no exception. The entire main cast displays great chemistry and have well-written dialogue, all of which contributes greatly to the development of each individual. As for the supporting cast, the majority of them are completely buyable as characters (Olivier, Ling, and Ross are all supporting roles that bring something to the table). There are a few vaguely developed state alchemists under Mustang's command that do feel rushed at times, but otherwise, FMAB's characters are just about perfect.
Enjoyment - 9: My enjoyment of this series is deeply rooted in its characters and its ability to pull off a truly compelling narrative unlike any other. Every episode has a purpose, every character adds to the chemistry (except, perhaps, a few background characters), and the themes are brilliantly fleshed out and are clearly written with the intent of making the viewer think. The only reason I didn't give this category a 10 is because after having rewatched it, I realized how important the element of mystery and suspense was to my initial enjoyment. I also reflected on how slow some moments ended up feeling because of it, resulting in my giving this category a 9. I simply feel that a show should be able to withstand a re-watch just as well as the first run through (if not, maybe a little worse) to get a 10 in enjoyment. 
Overall - 10: While I did find it hard to enjoy Brotherhood going through it a second time around as much as the first time, I can still respect just how well-put together this whole thing is. I recommend Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood to anyone who considers themselves an anime fan, particularly someone who has been put off of anime recently by boring, cliche shows; for this is not one of those shows. In particular, I recommend this series to anyone getting into anime, as this is some of the best the medium has to offer. 
Thanks for reading!!!  :3",10

                Disclaimer: This review is not about comparing Brotherhood to its predecessor from 2003 or the manga. I am reviewing this show as a stand-alone series.
It is no secret that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is popular. FMA: Brotherhood still gets overwhelmingly positive feedback from the anime community, although it finished airing over ten years ago. However, being a popular show does not always mean that it is good. That is why one of the most remarkable things to note about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is how it is recognized and acknowledged by the community. It is either included in hundreds of ‘The best anime of all time’ lists
                  all over the internet or ranked by thousands of people as the best show on several platforms, specifically on AniList, MyAnimeList, and Anime News Network. What makes it so special? What does Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood have that the other similar shows lack? Why do thousands of people all over the world love it? So, in an attempt to answer those questions, let’s dissect the show and figure out together why this title is so heart-warming yet bitter-sweet and overall fantastic and amusing shounen. Although this anime might not need an introduction, I’ll still start with the basics for the people who have never heard about FMA or are not familiar with the series.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is definitely one of the top-notch shows because of how it explores and builds the world of its universe.
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the second anime adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist manga written by Hiromu Arakawa. The show first aired in April 2009 and continued its run until July 2010, finishing with 64 episodes in total. It was developed by the studio Bones that gave us such popular titles as Ouran High School Host Club, Soul Eater, Noragami, MHA, and many other decent series. The remake of the 2003 anime is known for following the manga as close as a show can. That is why the fans fell in love with the Brotherhood even more since there are only two filler and four mixed cannon episodes out of 64.
In the world of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, alchemy plays a crucial role in multiple major aspects of the show, including its most basic plot. Alchemy is presented to us as this ancient scientific abstract art of manipulation and alteration of matter by using natural energy. What alchemy essentially does, it comprehends, deconstructs, and reconstructs. While this technique sounds amazing, there is one golden rule, the basis of all alchemy, ""In order for something to be obtained, something of equal value must be lost"". Our two protagonists, young Elric brothers, Edward being the oldest and Alphonse being the youngest, learned this Law of Equivalent Exchange the hard way after attempting human transmutation, the taboo of all alchemists. As a result of the violation, the older brother loses his left leg, while the younger one his body. Scared of his brother being completely taken away from him, Edward sacrifices his right arm to attach Alphonse’s soul to a suit of armor. Now, their main goal is to return to their normal, human selves, since Alphonse is now connected to a huge body armor suit and Edward gets mechanical replacements, automail, for his missing limbs and becomes a state alchemist carrying the name Fullmetal Alchemist. As mentioned above, this is the fundamental plot of the series. Now, what makes FMA: Brotherhood such an incredible anime is not how multidimensional the show is but how multilayered it is. While on a 3-year-long dangerous adventure to return their original bodies, the Elric brothers discover the existence of a powerful artifact called the Philosopher's Stone, which allows alchemists to overcome and ‘break’ the above stated Law of Equivalent Exchange. In return for learning about the Stone (yes, I just referenced the Law), Edward and Alphonse learn the shady story of their own country by getting caught in a governmental conspiracy while uncovering the real nature of the Philosopher's Stone.
As you can see, the bedrock of this show is quite diverse and includes a bunch of food for thought starting from something as basic as the significance of family relationships and ending with a dreadful question about what makes one human. However, the most crucial aspect that separates FMA from many other shounen anime, in my opinion, is the existence of the Law in the show’s universe. I noticed that a lot of shounens nowadays fail to set up any ground rules, which leads to complete absurdity, overpowered characters, and nonsensical tropes. It was nice to see Fullmetal Alchemist lay out the basic principle of its universe for the viewers and stick to it, instead of coming up with random explanations and ‘breakthroughs’ on the fly just for the sake of amusing the audience.
I strongly believe that the overall plot of this anime is incredibly interesting, starting from the brothers’ desire to have human bodies again and ending on the discourse about the military conspiracy that is rooted so deep into Amestris, the country where the action happens. In my eyes, even if we put aside characters, their development, and other aspects aside, it is safe to say that FMA is definitely one of the top-notch anime because of how it explores and builds the world of its universe, how it unpacks all of the enigmas through tiny details not only in dialogs or flashbacks but the animation itself, how it makes you, the viewer, question what is good, what is evil, or do these definitions even exist. Clearly, there are so many moments where you feel so happy for the ‘good’ characters in the show but what makes Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood a part of an amazing-anime-club is how it creates the connection between the viewer and the ‘bad guys’. Speaking in a bit of a harsh and general manner for the sake of avoiding spoilers, the show plays with your feelings to a certain degree and makes you wonder if the villains deserve the punishment or not.
Fullmetal Alchemist might seem to be kinda fast-paced at times but it makes up for it by staying consistent, regardless of the speed at which we are being told a story about two brothers, their family, friends, and comrades. It might seem like we are moving really fast at a certain point because the show tries to unpack a million different topics in a very short period of time, sometimes it’s reversed. However, it is essential to remember, everything that happens on the screen happens for a reason. As mentioned above, this anime has little to no fillers but even those are tied to the story smartly. Therefore, if the event seems to have no meaning behind it or it feels rushed, my advice would be: trust the process; it will all make sense in the end.
FMA: Brotherhood is a shounen after all, so you get a lot of breaks from or during serious moments when staff decides to input some funny animation or dialog to kindly remind us to have fun while watching the show instead of constantly being focused on the seriousness of it. From my perspective, it is a nice touch to the anime because at the end of the day it is an entertainment medium. I see FMA get criticism for inserting banters because they ‘don’t fit the mood of the scene’, however, I personally disagree with that. FMA can get very intense at times and those funny moments are used in really clever ways to reduce our, the viewers, tension.
I dare to say that FMA has slim to no one-dimensional characters.
I’ve briefly mentioned some characters’ aspects above, so I’m going to dive deeper into characters and their ‘quality’ in this section, which is a quite difficult topic to dissect. It is difficult mainly because this show creates a narrative where it plays with your head, emotions, and rationale, making you believe that nearly every character is the main character of the show. I know, it sounds a bit strange and overwhelming but FMA does it in such a shrewd manner where you don’t really notice that you care so much about this specific side character and actually treat it as the main one for a second. The show usually achieves this effect by, for example, giving you their backstory, analyzing (in a way) someone’s dialog, manners, values through other characters. Obviously, the majority of the screen and storytime goes to the Elric brothers but it would be inexcusable to not mention how well this show treats its side characters, how much love goes into them (both good and bad guys). Each character has a personality, there are no clones in the interest of adding some extra faces to the cast. Although there is a somewhat clear separation between what the good and the bad guys want and need, it can be said with confidence, there are little to no characters that lack some sort of identity. Some of the cast wants to return to their original bodies, others want to rule the country, others want to restore their family’s honor. Therefore, I dare to say that FMA has slim to no one-dimensional characters.
Much like the plot, now and then it might seem as if there are a lot of characters in the show but they are all there for a reason. From my standpoint, Fullmetal Alchemist is the anime where the side characters build up the main ones, the Elric brothers, and intensify the plot. I think that this is something you rarely see in the shounens nowadays because the main character(s) is/are expected to carry the weight of the show, while FMA in some sense splits the story baggage and puts it on everyone included in the show. By doing so, the series can explore multiple characters without really overwhelming the viewers because (almost) every single one of them has some significance to the show that they carry, subtle or not. Therefore, Fullmetal Alchemist gives us so many characters to choose from that we might be able to relate to and connect with on a deeper level. Not only that but, in some cases, it makes our empathy for not-so-good-but-also-not-really-evil characters to get through and questions our own humanity through the Elric brothers’ eyes.
While we are talking about subtleties, this show has a huge number of small, tiny details that bear immeasurable value that is hidden not only in physical objects in that universe (actually drawing/animation wise) but in the personalities, specifically in regards to villains. Those little elements don’t really affect the plot that much since it is not a big deal if you don’t notice them. However, this is why FMA: Brotherhood has such massive rewatchable potential. Trust me, after rewatching the show at least once, you will notice something that you never observed. Although this show doesn’t disappoint you, has a well-written ending and everything falls into place, there still will be a moment in your head when everything just falls into place even more after you rewatch at least the second half of the show. It feels incredibly empowering (in a way) when you realize and detect certain tiny things in the show. It makes us, the viewers, feel like we have truly emerged into that universe and are a part of it. It allows us to continue creating and building that universe in our heads. That is what makes this show an incredible piece of work.
Some words about animation and soundtrack (I suck at this part).
I am personally not a very artistic person and I prefer to focus on other things about the show, so it’s somewhat difficult to talk about animation or music. However, one of the things I would love to say is that FMA’s animation aged very well. While I was watching it, it was really hard to believe that this anime was done in 2009. There were multiple scenes throughout the series that I am pretty sure were money-shots. The color palettes follow the ‘mood’ of the series, the timeline is set in as well as the atmosphere of different scenes. I really enjoyed watching the fighting scenes since they were not as obnoxious to the eye as other shounens scenes nowadays (I’m blind as a bat and sensitive to light because of chronic headaches).
Soundtracks, openings, and endings were incredible, although some of the openings were inconsistent in their structure (when they introduced characters) and animation (coloring wise) but the animation itself saved those ones. The music fits perfectly (to my tastes) and doesn’t feel disconnected from the show. My most favorite part about this show is when they insert the ending song when something really important starts to happen, and then it is slowly transitioned into the regular ending animation sequence.
TL;DR
The bedrock of this show is quite diverse and includes a bunch of food for thought starting from something as basic as the significance of family relationships and ending with a dreadful question about what makes one human. In my eyes, even if we put aside characters, their development, and other aspects aside, it is safe to say that FMA is definitely one of the top-notch anime because of how it explores and builds the world of that universe, how it unpacks all of the enigmas through tiny details not only in dialogs or flashbacks but the animation itself, how it makes you, the viewer, question what is good, what is evil, or do these definitions even exist.
Each character has a personality, there are no clones in the interest of adding some extra faces to the cast. Although there is a somewhat clear separation between what the good and the bad guys want and need, it can be said with confidence, there are little to no characters that lack some sort of identity. Therefore, Fullmetal Alchemist gives us so many characters to choose from that we might be able to relate to and connect with on a deeper level. Not only that but, in some cases, it makes our empathy for not-so-good-but-also-not-really-evil characters to get through and questions our own humanity through the Elric brothers’ eyes.
FMA’s animation aged very well. The music fits perfectly and doesn’t feel disconnected from the show.",10

                Oh, the elden ri- I mean, Oh the good ol' ""why is it the top 1?"" well, let's get into it...
Imagine a perfect masterpiece, one that is so amazing that you literally have nothing to discuss about after the end, because it just doesn't let anything without explanation. 
You can dislike it, but you can't deny that it's just all around perfect, bro. As an adaptation, it's perfect. As an solo story, it's perfect. If you never watched any anime before, it will be the perfect start, but if you're a veteran weeb without social life that started with School Days and readed/watched the entirety
                  of One Piece more than one time like Me, or is already used to watch crazy, bizarre and full of bullshit stories like JoJo, it will still be an amazing journey for you!
Good start, perfect development and epic, but still very personal conclusion!
And the characters? Oh the characters- maybe I am biased, ya know, it's really good seeing a short MC when you are... short. 
You want good fights? it's made for you. You want a perfect central plot? it's for you too then! 
Besides that, the anime has OVER THE TOP soundtrack and openings (I don't even need to talk about RAIN and Again, do I?) outstanding and consistent animation and extreme precise direction.
Just ask yourself, when people use a series to compare when a contender to the ""best anime"" spot appears, it must mean something, right?
it is what it is, a frozen-in-time Gem, untouchable and unreachable, a Born legend, that is now retired just sitting on the well-deserved throne, watching everyone from above.",10
"
                Even though it was an anime more than 10 years ago, the development is more unpredictable than I expected.
As for the title, it was an unpredictable animation in a good way. But I think it was a work with exquisite content that was not too unreasonable.
[About story/drawing]
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a remake of the ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", and I had a faint memory of seeing 2003 when I was a kid. To be honest, it was based on Shonen Magazine, let alone 10 years ago, so I didn't expect much. I knew some old anime songs, so I started watching them for that purpose.
Therefore, until the
                  first course, I saw the battle scenes and the depictions of detailed drawings and felt that it was good work.
Did you start to get hooked around the second course? Every time I finished watching one episode, I wanted to see the next number of episodes as soon as possible. For recent anime, I feel that it is often possible to predict future development as you watch it. However, it's been a while since I felt that I was betrayed in a good way. Furthermore, I think it is good that the development is not ""simply an unexpected development"", but ""a development that can be convinced if you look at the depiction of the character so far"". As a result, after the 3rd course, I was completely addicted to the show.
[About voice actors and characters]
Many mental depictions are different from simple emotions, but the acting of the voice actors, including the main character, was also good, and I think that the complex emotions of each character were well expressed.
There are many characters, but even myself, who is not good at remembering people's names, caught up without problems. I think it's because the designs of the main characters aren't covered at all. It was clear how to draw the basic design such as age, body shape, eye position and shape, and skeleton. Especially the design of the eyes is clearer than in other animations. 
[About music]
After all, OP and ED songs were good. However, the drawing moves more than I expected, so I thought it was good to see it not only in the song but also in the animation.
【summary】
I thought it would be redundant to add all ☆ 10, but I think all the items are wonderfully well-balanced works. It is a work with a lot of stories.",10
"
                It's been nearly ten years since Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood started airing. I remember trying to watch it then (was it an early example of simulcast here in the US?) and struggling with it. I had seen (and loved) the original series, but the pacing of Brotherhood just felt off to me. A few years later after failing to keep up with the simulcast, I would read the manga and ""get"" why the ending to the original series disappointed a lot of people. I would try again with Brotherhood in the middle of this decade, enjoying it more, getting deeper into it, but would peter out
                  in the beginning of season four. Now, finally, with the decade about to wrap up, I re(re)started the series and took it to the home stretch.
At this point it's been a long time since I either watched the original series or read the manga that I felt like I was coming into Brotherhood with fresh eyes. Gone was the need to try and compare what Brotherhood does with what either prior form did. I would still argue that the original series has better pacing during the first half, and does a better job hitting some key emotional moments--but I no longer know if that's an argument of reality, or if it's just nostalgia.
But even if we give the original series a bit of a nostalgia-boosted leg up on early series pacing/emotions, Brotherhood does such a phenomenal job of developing characters that it carries the series through to the end. And sure, a heavy load is carried by Edward and Al, as well as Winry and Roy Mustang and Izumi, etc, etc, but what really impressed me here is the way our antagonists are treated, particularly the Homunculus, are treated. These are characters that start off feeling cartoonish in their evil: big powers, snake-like smiles, a disregard for human life, Pinky and the Brain take-over-the-world plans. But as the series progresses, they develop in surprisingly complex ways. Certainly Greed is the greatest benefactor of this, but Envy comes close, too. Envy never reaches a point of being LIKABLE per se (too much cruelty there to find any kind of redemption story), but we see sparkles of humanity (a term he himself would despise) in him--we get a sense of sadness, even as we detest him. It's a tough balance, too easy to try to justify a bad character's actions or to try to ""redeem"" them. Thankfully, Brotherhood doesn't try, and as such some of Envy's scenes land heavy punches.
Anyway, Brotherhood proves to be top-tier anime.",10
"
                It took me a while to watch the whole anime, but finally i will make a review about it, on the first 10 episodes the anime looked a bit boring and hard to watch, and because of that i thought that i wasnt gonna expect much, however the real deal started on the Homunculus Introduction Arc, and then story got really interesting and because of that, i couldn't stop watching it, i was desperate and i wanted to see the ending so badly, the art its pretty good at the time the anime was made, the sounds are perfectly well made and OST is pretty
                  good to, and all characters are remarkable and well developed, in my opinion this is one the best anime in history.",10
"
                What can I say? It's the highest-rated anime on MAL for a reason. The excellent and deep story, fantastic pacing, pleasurable music(sound is also great too) and beautiful art culminate in a great anime.
I did watch most of the original FMA anime and while it does give me nostalgia it is obviously the weaker anime compared to Brotherhood. I definitely appreciated the fact that what took 3 episodes to deal with in the original, needed one in Brotherhood. Almost all the openings in Brotherhood are great as well as the ED's. 
Over 64 episodes, I became extremely attached to these characters because they are so
                  well realised in this anime even with the Elric Brother's being the main characters the whole show is based on. Each layer of mystery is unwrapped perfectly with the pacing of the show. Everything is done so well.
It's hard to express in words what an experience this anime is, seriously.
Go watch it. Now.",10
"
                Hello today I'll be reviewing my favorite anime (so far) note I haven't seen the FMA 2003 so OG fans don't hate on me please, anyways let's get started. [Also this the first time I've review an anime so I'm kinda nervous cause I don't wanna look dumb ya feel me?]
Plot:
The plot is about two boys (Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric) Trying to find a Philsopher Stone to get their bodies back after trying to resurrect their mother with alchemy (which is a taboo). The pacing at the beginning is a little fast and might turn off some people but once you pass episode 13
                  the pacing is well done and good and the story is straight forward with no unnecessary confusing plot and no fillers (unless you count that beautiful recap episode a filler than yes) and the world building of this anime is amazing as hell.
Art:
The character designs are amazing not all the characters have a unique designs or anything but still well drawn and beautiful. The world drawn beautifully and the fights are amazing to watch although there's a certain CGI monster character (not saying his name cause spoilers) that annoys me a little and just really bother me but the animation is still amazing as hell.
Soundtrack:
The music in this anime is amazing it has so many memorable tracks and the openings and endings are amazing (Golden Time Lover is the best OP IDC IDC) but I feel like they use some tracks a little too much but that's just me the music is still memorable.
Characters: Brotherhood has such a loveable and memorable cast man it gives you the characters you're supposed to hate and the characters you're supposed to love. Not all characters really had an emotional impact on me but they were still memorable though in conclusion the characters are cool.
Final Thoughts:
This anime in my honest opinion is a Masterpiece it has a memorable cast, amazing soundtrack, fantastic animation, it has shocking WTF moments and scenes they'll leave you excited and sad everyone should really give this anime a chance and watch it in Conclusion this anime is a 10/10.",10
"
                Objectively, a flawless masterpiece. This is the manga adaption that follows the manga through and through. If you have watched the older version of the anime, it may be a good watch, but nothing like this. To put it simple, this anime is not short, but not long either. It hits where it needs to end correctly. It starts from A to a whole lot of dramatic fun to B. The story tells is precise and not confusing, but very complex with many twist plot holes that connects to the end that finish any loose ends. It's an absolutely stunning anime in ever section, from
                  story, to art, to sound, and to character. But more importantly, it ultimately entertain the audiences to no end. More importantly, it stands alone with no crazy ""movie sequel"" or a sequel in general and kept true to us to the very end. While, not my favorite anime, it is my top 5 to watch both subjectively and objectively. Does it deserve the hype? Hell yes. Is it overrated? No, not at all, it deserve to be a highly rated anime. I'm not only recommending to watch this anime, I'd force to watch it. And if you don't like it, well, each of every own opinion, but seriously, you must be ices if you don't like FMA:B. I suppose if you don't like anime in general, then you wouldn't like this, but then, why would you be in MAL in the first place. If this review isn't enough and you want more depth of my review, say no more, it'll be on the bottom.
Without spoiler!
Story: Too amazing! Two brother embark on a journey to find a way to get their bodies back. However, in order to get there, they would need information. And the best way to get to their goals is to be the dog of the military (metaphorically). Upon entering the military, they found out about things that they shouldn't and as a consequences, they get sucked into many unfortunate situation that eventually involves the truth of how they could get their bodies back, but in order to do so, there is a dreadful truth. When learning that dreadful truth, they sought another way to get their bodies, but before they know it, the brothers was already destined to meet their fate as a sacrifice. Again, without spoiling anything much, it's basically about two brothers trying to get back their bodies because when they were young, they committed a forbidden technique that causes their body to be somewhere else. 
Art: What is there to say, it's an anime. I like it, but it doesn't mean that you have to like it. 
Sound: Too many awesome Openings & Endings. Not to mention, every background sounds are so appropriate for each moment, like when there is death, you can hear the sadness. When something is scary, it can be dreadful.
Characters: EVERY DAMN CHARACTERS ARE INTRIGUING AND COMPELLING! Enough said. 
Enjoyment: I think I've watched, at least, 3 times already from episode 1 to the final. Sometimes when I feel like it, I'll watch it again. It has sadness, despair, humor, happiness, tragedy, dramatic, emotional scenes. Each scenes felt necessary and not pointless to watch. Even flashbacks are good.
Overall: A true masterpiece that cannot be copied. The genius in this work is far too amazing to let go. If you haven't watch FMA:B, do so now because you'll end up regretting it.",10
"
                What defines a great show? Does the series need great story, does it need cool characters or good soundtracks, what about atmosphere and sceneries? I myself has always been a fan of good endings...
Do you ever wonder what defines a great show, or how great a show possibly can become, well... then i know for a fact, that you haven't seen Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood yet, because FMAB masters all these things almost flawlessly.
Fullmetal Alchemist: brotherhood is a show that strives for perfection. You can look all you want for flaws, but you won't find them easily. Though animations, characters, soundtracks etc. are great, I feel
                  like i should focus more on telling you about the story, as the story is thing that distinguish most from other series. Because the rarity of a great story is so extreme, and this might be your only chance to see something close to perfection.
Not only is it unique and original, but it constantly pops up some kind of new plot twist, so you can never truly predict what happens next.
FMAB would probably be the only show that never left it's original plot. There were some side stories, but if they first started on a side story, they would at least tangle it up with the main story and follow the story up to the end.
Summary:
Anyways... A great show that needs to be seen. I would recommend watching the original FMA first because of some inquiries that tends to be in a few count of episodes in FMAB. Also the first 12 episodes of Brotherhood is kind of a recap of what happened the first (ca) 1-28 episodes in FMA. Even though they have made it possible to be seen without seeing FMA...",10
"
                Fmab could have been better but the characters are too loud and annoying especially Elric Edward who was spouting nonsense everytime in a SERIOUS SCENARIO. 
The atmosphere felt wrong corresponding to its very mature and complex themes regarding politics, military, war, and technology.
The sound effects are a bit unbearable for me because I have big standards when it comes to sounds and it's bland as hell and it's so repetitive.
It has a really good story but it got destroyed because of nonsensical cliche tropes and unnecessary use of repetitive jokes with too much chibi artstyle. (ugghhh)
I also kinda not interested with its art because it
                  felt so cartoonish. Sorry but I am one of the new anime watchers here so I have bigger standards in animation and I watch modern anime shows.
The pacing and transition are somewhat uncomfortable but still watchable. It should have been 80 episodes. It's too fast and too much information are condensed in every episode.
I kinda enjoy and not enjoy it at the same time because of its good themes and unique story while bad execution.
Most of the characters especially the 7 deadly sins are so one dimensional I am getting very annoyed at.
This is my opinion. It would have been 8/10 if the characters had been more realistic than they are and if the pacing was not too fast. I'm Sorry fmab fans this anime is not really for me.",5
"
                The Elric brothers just become special since the beggining of the anime, you can the feel the love, hope and brotherhood they share together. This is my best anime, the story, the argument, the characters, all the do a magic stuff to us. Enjoy, my boys, this is probably the best anime we all ever have seen. 
Some people always ask whats the difference between the 2003 series and this one and i might say it's the way they evolve as brothers and even as a alchemist. Here i can see a more detailed relationship between the Elric bros and the fire alchemist, Roy Mustang
                  (btw he is one of the most intereting things in the whole series, no kidding you gonna love this rude guy.)
Another point is that Himoru Arakawa do not sexualize females characeters, just like many other animes do. Winry Bell as well as Riza Hawkeye are empowered women.",10
"
                It is very good. Watch it. You won't regret it.
The characters are great, each of them distinct and unique. Even though it's been a good while since I last watched it, I can still remember each of the characters and their unique character quirks.
You will laugh, you will cry. You be scared, you will be excited.
There really isn't another anime like this.
It's one of the highest-rated anime of all time for a reason.
Ten out of ten will watch again at some point when I have time.
If you've never watched an anime before, I probably wouldn't go for this one straight away but it's still a
                  good introduction into anime.",10
"
                The majority of shows are either light and enjoyable or profound and serious. This show, while making you believe profoundly, manages to entertain you to the end. Difficult to do that. To deeper shows or just another anime, it's a gateway show. Over a long weekend, you can readily binge this and it's worth your time.
This show has many topics, such as science vs. religion, institutional bribery, fear and panic that allow governments to systematically do awful stuff, what's real and different sides to the same case, and friendship/family vs. higher understanding. The best part is that without thinking about this stuff, you can just
                  watch this show. It's a fun show that has these topics, not a profound show that's fun at times.
The one issue I have with the show is the end. The ending feels like several deus ex machinas in a row because they didn't set stuff up correctly. IMO is rushing to the end and the villain never feels super strong. I would have liked him to show his authority and ideology a little more; I only grasped the motive and views of the villain after watching analytical videos.",8
"
                Re-make of the original FMA, but this time staying on track with the manga.
At first, the anime seemed rushed. But once it caught up to the spot it once reached in the original, it slowed down a bit, and started to really show potential.
All the way up to the end, i was kept at the edge of my seat wanting more, even if i was already farther in the manga, seeing it in anime form really brought joy.
It stayed faithful to the manga, all the way to the end.
Although i did like the original FMA's art style, a tad bit more... It was still amazing
                  to watch.
Overall i give this anime an EPIC/10",10
"
                its difficult to give this series a perfect score, because at times i wouldnt feel this way, but critically judging. it hits the mark
at times a moment feels rushed, or perhaps i just want more of a moment.
at other times i want the story to move one direction and the characters don't quite do that or what seems most reasonable
and especially the worst part is i want to see more of a certain character or thing, and sometimes the most loved characters you see little of.
all of this being said........when i really sit down and critically judge it, it scores perfect. also when im done
                  with a episode, i wanted to watch another, i haven't binged an anime in years. and i watched pretty much the whole thing in 2 days.
based off that, i and the little criticism i can find. i judge this as a masterpiece",10
"
                -Might contain spoilers-
This is an absolutely amazing anime. I specially loved the philosophical aspects of the show. Everything from homunculus to ending The Father had a meaning. I never thought i would cry at Envy's death, but it made me so emotional. ""One is all and all is one"" was so good. It also teaches us that death is inevitable and final. The Story and the characters all were amazing. I liked Edwars's and Alphonse's character development be it as little as it was. The bond of brotherhood shown was amazing as well. The show had its fair share of laughs and incredible moments. Especially
                  during the final episodes, the last episodes were so good I couldn't control myself to watch them. I recommend this anime to everyone.",10
"
                This anime is highly praised by many and rightly so; the action, drama and climax goes hard. The characters are motivated and passionate about their desires. When more hardships arrive they step up to the plate in order to get closer to achieving their goal. Both protagonists and antagonists are likeable where you wish they had more screen time and a way to shine more often. 
The characters each have their own charm that make them both unique and enjoyable, like Alex Armstrong's caring and passionate personality and Ling's banter with Greed. 
Alphonse and Edward's bond and morality is one of the driving force where
                  they want to make things right but at the same time don't want others to die in the process. It shows how they're still kind hearted even after the hell they experienced. 
The animation is fluid and beautiful, especially the fight scenes. I like the breaks they have when they show one of the characters and the narrators saying their name. The various openings is worth watching every episode. 
I highly recommend this one.",10
"
                From the beginning, the anime is slowly building up to the end of the series. It can feel a bit slow and pointless at certain points but I still believe it has a much more focused pace and plot than the majority of other shonen. The build up works well at developing characters that actually have character, distinct characters that you remember and actually care about. Many elements of FMA brotherhood can be compared to other shonen such as Naruto, and FMA brotherhood pulls these elements off much better than Naruto and the others. The story was conclusive and ending satisfying. 
If you want a
                  focused shonen that doesn't go 1000 different directions and doesn't have an infinitely powerscaling main character that eventually has to fight galactic beings or the strongest beings from other universes, then watch this. 
9/10 pretty good",9
"
                I'll keep my review for FMAB plain and simple...
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a once in a lifetime anime. It's visually stunning, comedic, well written and just straight up amazing in more ways than I could tell you, so I'll keep to the basics...
I've never once had a series where I was so pleased with the ending that it didn't even make me sad to see it end. I haven't seen the original FMA, and I don't plan on watching it for a while, but this.... Oh this...
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is, in my very personal opinion, the greatest anime of all time, nothing, not Death Note,
                  Clannad, Your Lie in April, nothing, comes close to FMAB. It's one to be remembered for decades and it will never be forgotten, at least I hope.
STORY - 10/10;
Nothing more to say, watch it, it's perfect in every sense. The fights are all intense, everything in paced well, and it's awesome.
ART - 10/10;
Again, everything in this aspect is absolutely perfect. The style is creative and the art style keeps you hooked.
SOUND - 10/10;
Every single OP in this series was a classic. The first being my favorite, sits itself on my Soundcloud playlist and downloaded on my phone to bring back some nostalgic memories of this series.
CHARACTERS - 10/10;
Again, if you haven't watched it, do. Winry is the best waifu, hands down, if you disagree, you die, it's not an opinion, it's a fact. Every other character were beautifully done, written, and acted.
ENJOYMENT - 10/10;
I'm just repeating myself at this point, just fucking watch it... lmao.
Don't hesitate to watch this given it's 64 episodes. Even with school, I downed all of them in 6 days. No other series has engulfed me like that before. WATCH. THE. DAMN. SHOW...
-0.00001 points because Ed doesn't like milk... Milk is lit...",10
"
                so freaking goooooooood!
i waited to see this anime for like 4 years!
well it's 4 years later and i devoured it. and i can see now what everyone was talking about. 
my boyfriend showed me the original fullmetal alchemist (2003) 4 years ago
and i absolutely loved it. 
i wanted to watch brotherhood right away but he told me i have to forget the original to appreciate brotherhood. to tell the truth, i did compared them at the beginning... it felt too fast for me, like they didn't gave much attention and time for relationships to develop properly.
but around episode 8 it starts to slow down a
                  bit and the relationships and personalities of the characters really starts to form.
i loved the way everything feels like it's on the line, everything is high stakes. they kill and injure characters you love so you don't get the feel of "" oh he's a main character so nothing will happen to him"" 
everything here has a toll, and the characters don't get a ""free ride"" or an easy way out, and it really changes the vibe for the viewer.
also something to note: even though i knew the characters, their stories and the basic plot i was so surprised how i couldn't predict and see ahead most of it. i couldn't tell what was coming and it made it all the more exciting.
the hype is real on this one. 
i'm just sad i can't watch any more episodes :(",10
"
                so i will keep this review as short as possible. if you have not watched fmab then you are missing out brother really u r missing out. so i will be divising this review into 5 parts
1= story----10 score
so the story of fmab is beautiful but but the first 9 episodes is a bit rushed because they try to recap al lot that has happened i the og fma anime. so in my opinion you should watch fma before fmab THEN YOU WILL HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDUNG OF THE STORY.
2= art----9.91 score
the studio that produced fmab is studio bones and oh boi didnt it do
                  a masterclass animation and art the art is beautiful and clear and beaytiful. yes.....
3= sound----9.81 score
....................... so the only place in my opinion wher fmab fails is at its character monolog if they fixed it it would have been even better but regardless the soundtrack is beautiful the voice actors are also op ans opening are also good so ya.

                Fullmetal Alchemist is a famous manga and Bones adapted it successfully. Here is my opinion about this Anime:
--Story: Its story is great. Some people will see that FA's story is similar to most of shounen anime but it's not all. Its story is added some tragedy details. Elric and his brother can't always save everyone. It makes them haunting.
--Art: Thanks to Nakamura, fight scenes are very well. And its art also doesn't have anything to say.
--Sound: I like some OP and sound is always good.
--Character: There are plenty of kind of character in Fullmetal Alchemist. This makes anime become more and more attractive.
--Overall: Good anime
                  to watch",9

                Oh yeah... Not just the note says a lot .. First time, I seen the original serie. But, FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the most complete series of all times! Drama, Actions, Adventure, Suspense.. The story is complex and very well defined. 
I liked because we have new characters, the best quality, a history and all make sense. This anime deserves the 1st place everywhere. 
All is best but in contrast to the first serie, the soundtracks is weaker. This anime should not be missing from anyone's list! 
For me, it's that anime which will stay in my mind and my heart forever!
Brotherhood power will always
                  remain an example to us, the rest!",10

                Grr wanted to rate it 9.5 but it's not possible. :D
Very very solid with only a few minor gripes that I can quickly cover.
There's some elements of the story that seem rushed, are poorly explained, or don't make a lot of sense. Sometimes there's time skips too which can be confusing. I had to do a little bit of research to connect all the dots. But when I did, it was fair enough. There's a good amount of room for interpretation.
And that's about it! Now on to the positives!
- Fantastic character designs! There's a large cast of supporting characters and antagonists that are just so
                  much fun to watch. They're all influential, interesting and alive, with their own goals and suiting voice actors. Some characters especially are a joy to watch every scene. Even the characters I ""don't like"" are well-created and established.
- Solid soundtracks!
- The animation is generally good throughout, but sometimes it just skyrockets to amazingness. Of course it does so on epic battles where it's required, but also on minor scenes it suddenly oomphs up. Battles are generally 'slow' and sceneric, with well-choriographed attacks and poses, which I found very refreshing, clear, logical, and just good.
- The story is also generally good! It starts strong and you get a lot of material straight away to start guessing. Then, along the way it gets more involved, better and better, evolving into mostly logical twists and turns.
- The pacing is like a rocket! It starts and never stops! But it's not too fast, either. They somehow manage to just keep it entertaining start to finish.
- The magic system, for better or worse, is very vague, but very cool looking. Sometimes it's not entirely clear what the 'power levels' of some characters are, and their abilities sometimes vary widely in strength, but whenever stuff does happen, it's fabulous.
- It's got several very true references to actual alchemy and philosophy, which is a nice touch! They did their research!
All in all I would definitely recommend it, whether you're new or a veteran to anime. It's got just the right amount of exploration, combat, and political intrigue combined with strong animation, characters, and story. It's even better if you're interested in (steampunk) Victorian age and/or WWII.",10

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
Okay, I think everyone must have even heard of this anime. 
I acknowledge that I'm not a pro-reviewer or something, but I'll try my best to be objective while writing this. 
First of all, I'd like to say this anime has some flaws, for example, at the beggining, it is as if animators assumed you've already watched 2003 adaptation, or even read the manga, even tho that wasn't the case for a lot of people. Another big and kinda annoying flaw, is that the ""joke"" of Edward being ""Small"" just breaks the immersion at times, and bruh, why? It can lighten the
                  ambient, but they overused it.
The story is pretty solid, I can't even think of any other anime series with any store alike, it has some philosophical messages and a lot of production behind, Arakawa-sensei had to study some of the alchemy's story just to make it coherent. 
It isn't perfect tho ... Father has some big issues as a final villain, even the homunculi feel more like villains and allies at some times. 
The thing I like the most about this anime, is how everything comes together, every character, every situation just comes together at some point of the story to make something big, demonstrating how a journey that began with 2 brothers alone, could be enormous at the end, enemies, friends, they all joined up at the end against a greater evil, even tho that ""evil"" is a very plain and generic character. 
And well... The concept of ""The Truth"" is awesome, it's a very interesenting interpretation of what is god. 
The art style is awesome and unique, every symbol shown has its own alchemic meaning, as I said, Arakawa had to study some alchemy to make everything cohesive and coherent. 
The music is great, it isn't the best, but I can say it's great at some moments, like when Buckaneer passed away, or during Greed's death (Sorry for the spoiler, I love him).
Characters... I think THAT is where this anime really shines. Let's begin with Edward and Alphonse. The story began with them being mere kids, innocent, ignorant, childish. They had one goal and nothing else. But as the story went on, a lot of things made them grow, made them cry, feel powerless against the situation. 
Winry is awesome, she is a perfect counterweight to Al and Ed, as she, from the beggining to the end, ignores Equivalent Exchange. She helps the brothers without asking something in return, she gives, but a lot of times, doesn't get anything in return. That's why I think that the scene at the end, when Ed declares that he loves her by telling her that he will give her half of his life, asking half of her's in exchange, she says that she will give him all of her life is so powerful and demonstrates how Winry just breaks the mold.
Another great character is Mustang, he is analytical and cold, but gets blinded by his own wrath, wanting revenge, the fight with Envy is epic, and demonstrates how he, as a character, didn't grow, but after that, he grew along with Riza, who was always by his side, helping him, both emotionally and phisically. They are a great couple till the end.
The homunculi are pretty ironic. They all represent perfectly that ""sin"" they are. And their deaths are ironic, as I said, most of them (excluding sloth) die in a way totaly contrary to their sins, or recognizing their sins, and what they really wanted in the first place, taking as an example Envy and Greed.
And I'll finish this section with Scar, a character with a really good development, another character, wich, like Roy, wanted revenge, but through a lot of moments on the series, realized that wasn't the way to go, that revenge would only bring more pain, and through redemption ended up on the good side, never forgetting his past, but accepting it. Throwing away his own name, cuz it is a gift given by his god, but he, at that point, had already betrayed him. 
In general, I can say this is a pretty enjoyable anime, even more if you're not that young and can analize every philosophical message this anime gives. It is rewatchable, I've seen it around 4 times since it came out and every time I watched it I've figured out new things in every character. But... It makes 2003 adaptation impossible to watch.",10

                Mostly spoiler-free review!
I know there's a fair amount of debate as to what the ""correct"" way to watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is. Some insist you have to watch the original series, while others say you don't. Since there was a lot of contradictory information floating around the internet regarding this, I decided to take my brother's advice and just watch Brotherhood as is. That is to say, this is a review coming from someone who has only seen Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
First off, I enjoyed it. But while I will concede that it may have been the cream of the crop for its time, I don't
                  think it holds up by modern standards (in regards to both storytelling and animation quality). As is the case with other cult classics such as Death Note, I think Brotherhood suffers from its own success. A lot of people, myself included, come in with high expectations when a series such as this receives recognition to this degree, and are subsequently let down when the series doesn't turn out to be the life-changing experience that everyone has been hyping it up to be.
Now, with that little preamble out of the way, let's get into the nitty-gritty.
As far as the story goes, the overarching plot and the motivation of the main characters were interesting enough to get me hooked right from the beginning. I was rooting for Ed and Al to get their bodies back the whole way through and I was genuinely interested to see how they would achieve it when it's clearly established that any kind of human transmutation should be impossible. It goes against the laws of nature.
However, while a good story is fine and all, slow pacing or a plot that meanders around can seriously damage it. And I felt like that was exactly the case with Brotherhood. The main plot frequently takes a backseat to bore the audience with politics or history lessons from secondary characters that seem to have very little to do with the situation at hand. Exposition is also handled poorly at times, usually in the form of flashbacks that are placed in the middle of the story with no connection to the present. Meanwhile, most of the main bad guys are playing 4D chess off-screen somewhere.
So if you were expecting an ""action-packed shonen"" with lots of spectacular fights and intense moments, temper your expectations a little. A good chunk of the show is spent dabbling in politics (I have no idea why the author thought this was a good idea) and things don't really start happening until you're 40-50 episodes in. It's a shame, but I think the ending more than makes up for it, even if some of the plot developments didn't really make a whole lot of sense.
The cast was a mix of both bland characters and interesting characters, and there's quite a number of them so don't feel bad if you can't keep track of all of them. Some of them (four characters in particular) also seem to come into the story out of nowhere with not much of an introduction, but I just learned to accept it. These days most series tend to give secondary characters a little more backstory, but in Brotherhood most of the focus was on the main characters so you're left with a supporting cast that doesn't feel fully fleshed out. That said, some of them can be very likable and I did find a few favorites personally.
Overall, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an entertaining ride with slow pacing and a finale that brings closure to just about everything you were wondering about while watching. Is it worthy of the number one spot? I wouldn't say so, I have watched plenty of shows that are far more deserving of it. Top ten, however? Yeah, definitely. Which is why I'm giving it an 8/10.",9
"
                To begin with, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite anime. I had mixed feelings watching, I laughed and I cried, the narrative is very well developed, the characters have a good development too and the soundtrack is beautiful, really, a lot of the feelings you have watching are because of the soundtrack .
The animation is good, but in many scenes it loses its quality, but in important moments it is absurdly fantastic. The mood timing is very good.
And the ending is spectacular & lt; 3
the only problems for me are a few ruined episodes in the beginning and the little twist that happens in the
                  final arc.
I recommend!",9
"
                It's not every day where completing an anime gives you fulfillment, or in my case, satisfaction. I've seen countless of shows, both anime and live-action TV shows, and I can say this is by far one of the most incredible and epic viewing experience I have ever been greeted with. I am glad that I  decided to watch it almost a decade after its release, and I'm a little bit salty I was reluctant watching this ""mainstream"" show. I truly believe this is a must to watch in regards of its fabulous storytelling and amazing character development. I have never seen a show where
                  its side characters, or ""randoms"" (that are not the main focus of the plot), become a significant character in itself despite being a ""support"" or ""side"". They are truly not side characters; as every person, figure, and animal has a profound impact on the Eldric brothers' morals, and the encompassing story that surrounds them.
I won't make it lengthy, as the synopsis gives a decent indication on what the story is about---however there is more beyond the story. It's the cliche journey that everyone must take, and that is what the Eldric brothers, and dozens of ""side"" characters go through. The characters feel so alive, so filled with exuberance and vitality that it is a truly unique experience to live through. 
If you are looking for an anime, tv show, or fantastic time, watch this. This isn't #1 on MAL for no reason. It's #1 because it's a masterpiece. That is one of the Truth I can provide you. The rest is up to you to discover its message.",10
"
                I must note I have only watched the Anime of FMA-Brotherhood, not read the manga and not seen the first anime version of this either. Because of all the praise this series has been receiving, my expectations were pretty high. And frankly, during the entire time I watched this, I've not been into it as much as expected when reading all of the reviews. Not to say I didn't like FMA-B, but I feel the concept was good and a bit more was in store than came out now.
Story:
The whole principle of Alchemy and later Elixerology has something mystic and spoke to me a lot.
                  Equivalent exchange, leading to the loss of body (parts) with the two main characters set the scene for a good story. Now, the reason I say good story and not great is really because I feel there was more potential here. As the story progresses I've hardly been surprised by plot changes and progress continuously is kind of obvious. Strangely, I even feel as if the story could unfold itself quicker, while I read in previous reviews the pace of FMA-B is actually quite high. Therefore I'm not too sure if I was satisfied with the ending, mainly because you could see it coming from far, far before.
Art:
Really good. Not much to add.
Sound:
One of the best anime when looking at sound. Good intro('s), hardly skipped them. During episodes not a lot of music stuck with me, bot never bothered me either.
Character:
I believe there was too little character development in Brotherhood. Now maybe more character development would have meant more episodes characterized as ""filler"", but I don't think that would have bothered me. Still, the main characters I believe are strong enough for a fair review.
Enjoyment:
Nice story in a nice setting. Didn't exactly deliver what I expected, but overall I never felt the urge to drop this one. Overall very enjoyable.
Overall:
Very good anime and I can understand all the buzz. Just not my top favourite.",8

                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was a masterpiece, there's nothing else to say.
This anime did everything right and nothing poorly.It managed to house a large cast of characters, with all of them having at least some sort of character development/growth.
The music was phenomenal, the dramatic vocals and eerie suspenseful pieces did wonders for the show and I still listen to a lot to the tracks to this day.
The animation itself was great, although it did hit too many over the top points like in Mob Psycho or My hero Academia, it still managed to provide consistently well-animated footage.
If you can point out something wrong with this show,
                  please let me know, but you are unlikely to find anything.",10
"
                Writing the analysis of this anime is very complicated because I reassemble it at least three times, just to have a better depth. Because, just praising gets boring. But I'll be honest ... I did not really find any fault.
If there was a perfect anime, he could well call himself FMA Brotherhood.
My only criticism, it would be the first few episodes that I found a little harder than they should be. Okay, there was already the FMA Classic that had the same beginning, with that already a good excuse to have run a little more.
The story is simply harmonious. All the mystery involving the homunculi,
                  the philosopher's stone, the truth, everything fits right. Even the background of secondary characters are well used.
The art, is very good for an anime of almost 60 episodes. Only sometimes it slips. The comic moments were very well fitted ... anyway, you can see that they put them more to save design time kkk
Soundtrack is also unique and very well enjoyed. I just found it very repetitive in parts. In the beginning everything is great, but from the middle to the end things get kind of boring with that track you've heard several times.
The building of characters by PERFECT. There is no word to describe it better. Because they managed to fit all backgrounds with the plot of the story, without letting annoying. This really helped to give that great pleasure of watching. Because ALL the characters were well used. POX TO EVEN THE FIGURANTS.
And finally, just talking about it ... Fullmetal is not in the first position atoa is not even",10
"
                Now I’m not a fanboy of the franchise by any means. I never read the manga or saw the first adaptation. All I did was watch this show. It’s no “masterpiece” but it is still VERY good.
Story [9/10]: The story was by far this show’s biggest high point (and the most important thing by far when rating an anime). The storytelling was properly paced, dynamic, and complex enough to satisfy everyone. There were many twists and surprising reveals along the way, but not too many where it becomes confusing and annoying.
Art [4/10]: The animation gets the job done... that’s it. The characters, settings, special effects,
                  and backdrops are bland in design, but are also crisp and well-animated. Visuals clearly weren’t on high priority.
Sound [6/10]: Voices and SFX were amongst the best of the best in terms of audio quality, but no cool sound effects to be found. Music leaves much to be desired, and in some instances causes the show to be dead silent.
Character [6/10]: The characters didn’t really feel too engaging. Most of them were just your by-the-numbers anime tropes. Nothing else to say here.
Enjoyment [10/10]: I really enjoyed watching this show. It’s storytelling kept me engaged and coming back for more. I’m sure you will enjoy this show as well.
Overall [7/10]: When the story is the show’s only high point, I struggle to give this show any more than a 7. I really like this show and I truly recommend it. I just don’t find any other aspect good enough to bump the score up any higher.",7

                FMAB holds up to its reputation as one of the greatest animes of all time, but I do not regard it as a masterpiece. It is a well-balanced series that does almost everything right, from animation and story character writing, yet excels at none. It has a tight story with deep philosophies woven in, and features lovable characters, some of whom are incredibly complex. The animation is smooth, and the fights are well executed. However, FMAB does not necessarily break any new ground, although to be fair, most anime series doesn't. It is quite difficult for an anime series to be called ""masterpiece,"" since most
                  of the more influential directors direct animated movies.  
Compare this to Neon Genesis Evangelion, a highly acclaimed series that is the touchstone of anime. Evangelion is highly flawed, especially when it comes to the controversial last two episodes, but it is a masterpiece for its original and daring visual artistry. Evangelion is a good example of Japan's avant-garde genre, and even though not as many people can appreciate it, once you have entered the world Anno built, you cannot escape. Your mind is reined in by the symbolism woven in, and you feel the need to rewatch it over and over to understand the message the director is trying to send. 
I am not trying to promote Evangelion. I am merely using it as a reference point, and to juxtapose FMAB with it to explain why I do not give this incredibly entertaining show a 10, as many MALs users do. I truly enjoyed it, however. 10/10 enjoyment. FMAB certainly is a classic that anime fans can enjoy even 10 years from now.",8
"
                Superb superb and even more superb
I’ll begin with its flaws first....
Right, now that’s over with i can continue with everything that’s great.  Firstly the characters. Expertly delivered character development which goes way beyond the main characters.  Even the sub sub sub main characters develop throughout.  Furthermore, the subtlety in which they develop is excellent.  I also don’t think I have watched an anime with such a thoroughly engaging cast, pretty much everyone you enjoy watching which each of them drawing you into their small piece of this magnificent story.  
Secondly the animation. From the very beginning a smooth and colourful
                  style hits you. There no waiting around. It get down to business right  away. The colour palette is warm and vibrant, even within the first scene at night.  These brilliantly animated fight scenes don’t continue in the same vein however.....they get better. With every scene they seem to improve, that coupled with the excellent characters partaking in them make for wonderfully enjoyable fighting.
Finally, the magnificent story. With every passing episode the story builds a little more, all the way trough to the very final episode. The reveals come early and are very frequent. There will be times where a big reveal will hit you, you take a step back, look at the episode count, see you are still in the teens and wonder how the hell they will top it in the episodes that  remain. Well let me tell you they do. The reveals get bigger and more impactful all the way to the penultimate episode. This story has to be, quite possibly, one of, if not the best story ever told in anime. The pacing is second to none, the characters are brilliant, the engagement is unrivalled and more importantly, is even better than the hype!
All in all I believe this to be one of the beat anime’s you will see. I would be very interested to chat with someone who thought on the contrary.  I honestly could watch it again immediately. Top 5 maybe even top 3 anime. Watch it, you won’t regret it.",10

                Spoilers Included
Story-The plot is about a pair of  boys,Edward Elric the FullMetal alchemist and his brother Al Elric, who venture out to the world in hoping of finding the key to restoring their bodies back to normal after losing them in a result of failed human transmutation.This is the best part about the anime,the crazy plot itself. It is very original and unique.Always being unpredictable,always catching you off guard with the plot twists and revealations,always making you think.Also the pacing is godly,not even the fights slow the plot down.Not to mention zero filler in existence and the ending is a god send.no complaints here.(10/10)
Art-The
                  art's pretty good and the animation is even better.It can just be really inconsistent at times like the character models,their faces for example.Animation never fails to impress.The  fights are also short,always interesting to watch,they,never feel dragged on characters like Mustang and Bradley often get the best animation strapped to their fights.The artwork usually changes when a gag scene is on screen.I recommend watching this in blu ray as well to see the art at it's highest quality,just can be inconsistent at times but in spite of that,i don't care,it's a 9.(9/10)
Sound- Sound is good between great.I'm a bit mixed with some of the new openings and endings and alot prefer the 2003's fma over them though I do favor openings 2,4, and 5 and endings 4 and 5.The ost is really good and really help convey the mood being on screen,though it can be unfitting at times,though at least they're played and stopped at the right times though alot of it is really fitting for the action scenes and gets better the farther you watched into the anime.Also,the voice acting for the dub is superb,all of funimation's voices really suit their characters persona and are well acted,no complains there. The dub Voices earn  itself a 10 while the ost,ops and endings get a 8.(8/10)
Characters-My favorite aspect about the show besides the story.The characters.lots of good ones here,even the minor ones.Your bound to find one to latch on to and we see a lot of them develope.
We get all sorts characters here like the military amestrians, the Ishvalans, and theXingese,The military amestrains are by far my favorite group of characters to watch on screen,many of whom wear the same uniform but have very distinctive personalities between them but that doesn't make the ishvalans and xingese characters any less interesting. The villains are based on the 7 deadly sins.speaking of protagonist,Edward Elric is a great one,I never get bored watching him on screenMy personal favorite crackers are Roy Mustang, he's the ambitious,arogant, snide, and manipulating Type ,the infatuation family obsessed loving realist Maes Hughes,cold,loyal and stoic Riza Hawkeye,and Greed.Really the best part about the show next to the story,not as single one feels bad or a waste of space,they all felt important to the story (10/10)
Overall-I enjoyed the anime all around from start to end except maybe the first select few(first 13 episodes,after that it was great),after that it comes the most enjoyable shounen to me,really strong unforgettable anime with lots of message. I recommend this show to new comers and veterans alike,there really is something for everyone here for all demographics,if not then most.even if you don't initially get attached to the show's character and plot,you should watched and experience this anime at least once.Totally worth all the praise and attention it gets. (10/10)",10

                The premise of this anime and the hype surrounding it were all but a hullabaloo. It never managed to rub off its 'supposed invincibility' on me. Sure, Alchemy is such an interesting subject to tackle but this show never managed to flesh out everything that its promise held. Naruto's chakra system's even more creative when it comes to power scaling and overall execution. The characters also look cartoonish and most of them are just borderline caricatures. I remember struggling just to finish watching all 64 episodes as it felt like sitting out a meeting when it could have just been an email. It's too predictable
                  that you can never get excited for the next episode or for what's to happen later. Respect to the author though for making her work shine in a male-dominated industry. No matter how the anime adaptation turned out, her story's still one of those tales you can't miss for the world.",6
"
                as per usual when i am extremely overworked and pulled so many all nighters in a row that i no longer wish to exist i want to roast something. today i will roast one of the most hyped mainstream shounen battles of all time, FMA in da hood straight outta compton.
my thoughts overall can be expressed shortly as: entertaining enough that i didn't start spacing out and daydreaming for 5 minutes before realizing that i have to rewind.
i kind of want to compare it to d.gray man. i'd like to think this is what d.gray man would have looked like if the author actually used
                  the ideas and setting in an interesting way instead of making it into a one pattern snorefest.
so it is about two brothers who do alchemy. their mom dies, they try to revive her and end up losing bodyparts/whole body. they then start working for the corrupt military, responsible for some genocidal war, and it turns out the ones pulling all the strings in these wars are artificial humans, called homosexomonculus or something, and of which the original homo-thing was created from, we don't get to know, only that van homoheim added his blood to it. the original homonculous has very vague, if any at all, motives for his creating of philosophers stones by destroying nations. as far as i know none of this is explained and it is thus hard to take seriously, he only blabbers on about ""oh silly humans how pitiful they are blablabla insert generic grumpy old man muttering"".
give him some warm milk and an alt-right newspaper subscription and send the bastard to the retirement home i say.
if your mind isn't boggled by above it is pretty great. well structured, the pacing is top notch. quality entertainment
TL;DR artificial human/homo-thing wants to destroy/consume god by gathering philosophers stones by destroying nations and killing all of its inhabitants, for reasons unknown.",7
"
                Definitely THE anime of its decade. A must-see for every anime fans out there. FMAB certainly set the standard high for succeeding animes.
Everything about this series is beautiful, from the creative and emotional storyline, the smooth animation, the brilliant music and sound edit to the complex, badass and likeable characters. What stands out to me the most about FMAB is its line-up of amazing female characters that other shounens can only wish they could create. FMAB is proof that you don't need to make a female character a protagonist to make her memorable. I am happy that for once a shounen doesn't provide fanservice using
                  its female characters by making them wear scanty, revealing clothing or act cute. 
But of course that's not all distinctive about FMAB. The poignant story about the two brothers on a quest to retrieve their body after a botched alchemical experiment is already an interesting enough of a premise, but as the story progresses, viewers soon realize there is more than meets the eye. The two protagonists soon uncover a conspiracy involving high-ranking officials that threatens to engulf the whole country. The brothers' journey is not only a journey to retrieve their bodies but also to save the country while reflecting upon themselves, what alchemy means, what life entails, and what the truth is. The brilliant philosophy of self,  humanity, truth, and universe is smartly woven into the story, giving the viewers not only a roller coaster ride of action and plot twists but also time and emotional break to ponder about life and ourselves.
The only flaw that I have with FMAB is the pacing in the first few episodes, which is a little too fast. We do not have enough time to become attached to a character whose role becomes pretty important as she is serves as a wake-up call for the two protagonists about the evils of alchemy, and also the impetus for Edward's decision at the end of the series.
Anyway, this series is a masterpiece. 10/10. If there is any anime of this decade that I deem capable of toppling FMAB, it is Shingeki No Kyojin.",10

                9/10 overall for me
I've watched this anime over 5 times already. It's easy to watch, or listen to. The story is very entertaining, and captivating at parts. I definitely developed a slight sense of attachment to the characters, and it was awesome to see how much they grow throughout the series. 
What I enjoyed the least, is how annoying Ed seemed at first. But they balanced it out with his brother being the calm one. However they made his personality match pretty well with how people around him treated him, and reacted to him. 
He also gets less annoying later on, as they show him
                  growing.",9
"
                I really loved this anime. I loved the original version too. They're very different stories after the first few episodes so if you're planning on watching either, I'd recommend you see both. 
The original Fullmetal Alchemist is much darker and quite slowly paced at times, but the characters are developed superbly, and you have sympathy for the villains which is always a good thing in my opinion :) The ending fits well with the tone of the series although a lot of people were unhappy about it, but the movie sequel helps somewhat.
Brotherhood, on the other hand, has a much more fast moving plot and
                  tighter storyline. The characters aren't as well developed, but there are much more characters in this series (some, like General Armstrong, are totally badass, others, like the chimeras whose names I can't remember, kinda blend into the scenery but are still kinda cool). The ending is also much happier and more satisfying in this series :)
So if you like something dark with lots of character development, watch the original. If you like a more shonen feel and a slightly tighter, more fast-paced plot, watch Brotherhood. Both are excellent animes and both are worth watching :D",10

                Comparing this to the manga, I was very dissapointed. 
Everything moved too quickly... I understand that they skipped a few parts of the manga that were already shown in the first anime, but other parts that were never showed in the first anime, completely disappeared. :(. I was frustrated that they didn't stick to the manga 100%, which was what I thoght they would do.
But the animation, music, and everything else was great,xD. And although it's kinda dissapointing, FMA Brotherhood is still awesome. Same with every other version they would make of it.xD

                While searching on what to watch next, I saw in numerous forums many people agree that FMA:B was one of the best anime without fighting too much about it. So what anime could have such an impact? That's how I started my journey into this masterpiece.
Story:
It really follows closely the manga. Some initial details are left out in the first episodes, mainly cause FMA had already an anime adaptation that went through that stuff. The pacing is great and whatever question you have about the plot is answered. The transition between the brothers' journey to getting back their bodies, discovering a dangerous secret and then
                  fighting not only for their lives but for a whole country was really smooth to me. It deals with many things like ""Is it ethical to search for eternal life and how to resurrect people?"", ""A war is justified just from having a single person die from an enemy?"", ""What is the truth behind everything?"". The sure thing is that the story will get stuck to your mind.
Art:
I'm no animator or artist but the art is so nice and easy to the eye. The fight scenes were great from the coloring to the pace. Also I was very happy that the comedy parts were as cute as in the manga. Studio Bones did an amazing job with keeping Arakawa's art intact.
Sound:
FMA:B has a suberb OST from Akira Senju, wholly orchestrated and also some of the greatest OP's in all of anime. You'll be singing ""Again"" like crazy. Guaranteed.
Character:
In all the anime I've watched I still haven't seen a number of so many characters so fleshed out. All the people we watch have a beginning, a middle point that influences them and an ending that fits every single one perfectly. Male and female characters don't fall under stereotypes. Men aren't all powerful and we feel that they are aware of their weaknesses and women aren't crying little girls, they are more dynamic and know when to take action. You won't find a character that dosen't deserve your love (or hate).
Enjoyment:
I'll just say that I've rewatched the series 4 times. I absolutely love it. I have bought all the manga volumes too. For me there's no other anime like FMA:B. It has that special something that lures me back to its' world.
Overall:
It is, and will always be, a masterpiece to me. I can't recommend it enough to the people who ask about it. Of course for some people it might not be that amazing as they thought, but I believe that everyone who will watch it will agree in one thing: 
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a story that you must experience even once in your life, even if you are not fond of anime.",10
"
                I really enjoyed the anime and think it's good. I was impressed with how it tricked me many times and always made sense. It was enjoyable but not enjoyable enough to be in my top 10 or something like that, and I see I don't enjoy it as much as most people. Still, really good anime.
The story was all connected and well built. It's impossible to say anything that happens, even the most minor detail, without spoiling so much, which might be why I barely ever see people talking about this anime. 
Some of the best opening songs were used, Rain being one of my
                  favourites of all time. USO, the first ending, was also really nice. The soundtracks also complimented the events very well.
My favourite characters are Ling and Hohenheim, and overall I really loved the characters. I was sad that Scar wasn't as good in my opinion as he is in FullMetal Alchemist though.
Final Score: 8/10",8

                This review contains some spoilers
Story: 9/10
So, I liked the idea about the main anime. It makes the viewers want more from this anime. It really catches everybody's eyes when reading the plot. The story is basically about two brothers trying to retrieve their bodies since they lost doing a revival process. The younger brother's soul is kept in an armor and the older lost his leg and arm. The reason I did not give this a 10 was because it confused me at first since the beginning was not that great but you will soon get used to it.
Art: 10/10
The characters looked different from other
                  anime. It has more of a cartoon vibe in it and since it was made in 2009, the quality was outstanding. I was surprised when first watching this anime.
Sound: 8/10
I guess the sound was fine since again it is quite an old anime. How they voiced the main characters were also outstanding as well.
Character: 10/10
I absolutely adore all the characters in this anime. Edward Elric is short but super hilarious. He may be a little childish and rude sometimes but I still love him either way. The way the brothers perform alchemy is very eye-catching and cool. Alphonse Elric is equally as funny. He is a timid and caring boy. The complete opposite of his older brother, Edward Elric.
Enjoyment: 10/10
This is an action packed anime. It has a ton of scenes within the use of alchemy. The fights are awesome. This anime also was hilarious that it made me tear-up. I love this anime all the way.
Overall: 10/10
I highly recommend this anime to people who loves comedy , adventure, military and action. You will love the characters skills and personality.However if you take things seriously this anime might be childish for you. Overall, I loved it and most people will as well",10

                                                         [POSSIBLE SPOILERS]
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is undoubtedly one of the best shonen anime.
Story
The story starts off when the main character Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric wanted to resurrect their deceased mother but since the human transmutation backfired, it costed Edward's leg and Alphonse's body. Edward realised that he made a huge mistake so he made a deal with The Truth (God of transmutation) to big
                  back his brother Alphonse and that costed his arm. The story then continues when Edward burns down the house that him and his brother lived in so that they cannot turn back and are forced on the journey to get their original bodies back. They joined the military to accomplish their goals but not to participate in brutal, genocidal campaigns to generate a Philosophers Stone from the people they killed. Of course, the military get complicated throughout the series as it gets corrupted by evil immortal devils using Philosophers Stone to create an immortal army of alien-like creatures. The story overall is interesting and written well throughout the series. 
10/10
Art
The general art and animation for an anime adaptation from 2009 is impressive, it has high definition and high framed action scenes with simple colours palette used to light up the world. The simplistic colour palette gives the look of the early 1900s matching the general theme of the show.
9/10
Characters
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood introduced many side and minor characters are in the show in a steady pace. All the characters have depth and a reason why they exist in the show especially the main characters. The main characters changed a lot from the start like how childish Edward was eagerly trying to bring back his brother till the end when he realised the truth about the military and prioritised others lives over their own body.
10/10
Enjoyment + Overall
I surprisingly enjoyed it despite the fact that I almost dropped the show. The show started off really slow paced because it developed the general background information of how alchemy worked prior the development of the main characters. It was a smart way to engage me more into the characters with a little background knowledge of what is alchemy. The show used its slow paced story to foreshadow future events and introduce new characters and give them depth. Overall, the anime is both extremely enjoyable and well written in every aspect of the show.
8/10

                Fullmetal Alchemist; Brotherhood was a series I picked up because of its raving reviews. Of course, I had to watch the show rated no. 1 on MAL, and boy am I glad that I did. In this review, I'll sum up how I fell in love with the show and its characters, and how FMAB sauntered its way into my no.2 spot of favorite animes of all time.
disclaimer : slightttttt spoilers, nothing major at all
Skip to the end for a shorter review summary :)
---
To start off with the art and sound, I thought the animation was very well done and the Japanese VA was done
                  perfectly. Both the animations and the VA captured each character so well and because of it the show ran so so SO smoothly. I definitely appreciated the effort that went into the animation and both of these factors made the show run at its full capacity.
---
The characters are AMAZING. Like I'm not joking, AMAZING. The character development was so well thought out and executed that as a viewer I was able to see all sides of EVERY character, including the damn mini-panda-cat that May had. Like the mini-panda-cat had a backstory, like WHAT?
Ed and Al are the dynamic duo we all know and love, yet we don't deserve them at all. As the plot progressed you could see their personalities and relationship grow and change, and their dedication to each other as brothers was so fulfilling to watch.
As for my other favorite characters, Ling/Greed, Scar, Mustang, and Olivier, they all had great character developments of their own and the show made it clear that Ed and Al weren't the only characters we should be focusing on because all the others had their own qualities that drew us to them.
I will say that some characters were a bit lacking, or at least I wanted to see a bit more of them, including Lan Fan, Fu, May, and the three guys that could turn into the lion, frog, and alligator ( i think, I forgot their names ). I didn't see as much of them as I wanted, and I honestly forgot about them in the last couple of episodes.
---
And for the plot, nothing short of amazing as well. Definitely original, definitely had me thinking, and definitely offered up existential questions for the viewer to answer for themselves. The situations each character was put in spoke to us as viewers, as their opposing views in the show reflected our own struggle to pick what's ""right and wrong"" in a given situation. 
The ending of FMAB was 10/10 to me, and I saw everything that I wanted to, and yes I was brought to tears when Winry, Al. and Ed finally reunited at the end. And let's not talk about the battle that came before that, because that's something you're going to have to experience for yourself.
---
You see I don't think anyone will understand how good this series is until you give it a watch. It had me laughing, crying, stressed out, melting from ed's cuteness, and so much more. I'd say the plot is what made the show amazing, but in reality, its the loveable characters that resonate with us. 
I said it before, but there's a reason why FMAB is rated no. 1 on MAL, and whatever high expectations you have for this series, it goes above and beyond it.",10

                What an anime! 
It's one of the last animes I watched with my little brother. It holds a special place in my heart. 
The story 
The story is just insanely good. It shows you how much does it take to bring back the dead, and it fails. Nobody can bring the dead back to life. Not even the best alchemist in the world! It's seriously good. I was wanting more after the series was over, it's that good! 
The art 
The art style, in this anime, is great. It's one of those anime, where you don't care about the art styles, you care about the
                  characters and the story, but jeeze! The art style compliments the series. 
The sound 
From what I can remember, the sound is really good! 
The characters 
You care about the characters, almost all of them. They are so good! It's like the best for character development. 
The enjoyment 
I throughly enjoyed this anime. It's so good! I was left speechless after it concluded. 
The overall 
Watch this anime if you haven't already. It's so good. Try it if you don't even like anime. It's that good!",10
"
                The best anime I've ever watched. My #1 favourite anime when I was a teenager, and now, almost 10 years later, it still is.
Story: A perfect mix of action, tragedy, thriller, fantasy, and a dash of romance. The main story started off so simple - two brothers looking for a magic stone in order to restore their bodies - but over time grew complex without ever becoming confusing. The plot progression was just right, with the perfect pacing and perfect amount of details that went into each significant part of the plot.
Art: Great animation, great art work from Hiromu Arakawa. This anime has a lot
                  of action scenes, and everything went as smoothly as could be.
Sound: All of the opening and ending themes are amazing (for some reasons they fit the current plot perfectly). The soundtrack, bless Senju Akira, is stunning and clearly deserves its own praise. So many different BGMs for so many different scenes. It was never a dull moment.
Character: A myriad of characters, either good or evil or something in between. They were all excellently written and described, and each of them serves an unforgettable part in the story of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood as a whole.
Overall, this is possibly the one title I would recommend to someone who has never watched or liked anime. For me, it's perfect all over. Most of the anime I enjoyed during my teenage years I have grown to dislike (or found cringeworthy) when I rewatch it nowadays. Today, December 20th me attested that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is still the masterpiece I watched and loved. If you haven't watched it already, by all means, give it a try. You will not regret it.",10

                I just finished FMAB and I have to say it was so well made. Most of the character was flushed out and had their backstories and goals. The world building was so vast and expansive you can do a whole analysis on that such as the cultures, people, beliefs, and nations. The themes Fullmetal explored was also fantastic such as war, man's inhumanity to man , personal struggle the characters faced, and understanding morality. The author of Fullmetal really put a lot of effort into making Fullmetal. The art, animation, and music was a big plus for this anime also. The comedy in this anime
                  was well done and funny as hell, the funniest anime I have ever watched. The tone and the vibe was very nice also, at times it would get dark but I would be lifted by the comedy. But at times they mixed the comedy with the fights which was suppose to be serious and dark. The story was well done and nothing seemed out of place or didn't make sense.
The fights were confusing at times, half the time in the fights the good guys and bad guys were talking too each other way too much and other times they wont even talk and just start fighting. Another things is the pacing, I felt like the creators should have done a better job on shedding Ed's and Al's younger years and their troubles when they first joined the military and also the other characters also. My last problem was the consistency such as keeping the same music people enjoy alot to become a nostalgia for example keeping the same opening instead of it changing every time. And also doing a better job of making the audience care for the characters by doing a better job on the emotional scenes, their origins, and their dialogue.
So overall I enjoyed the show, it wasn't a masterpiece to say oh I will remember this show for the rest of my life, or bad to say that I'm never going to watch this show again . FMAB put a lot of passion into the visuals, story, and music which was a big plus because I enjoyed those aspects alot. But I think they could have done a better job in certain scenes and could have made the characters even more interesting and memorable then where they are right now.",9

                lol baccically the best anime ever dont @me... oh wait i have to write why um well OK THIS WILL BE SO EZ :D. first of the characters are amazing and lovable

                The art of the adaptation is, as any other, a colossal mountain to scale. To reach the summit, nothing short of mastery is necessary. Though, it must be said, there is no shame in climbing most of your way to the top and deciding to call it quits. Either because that final stretch seems impossible to clear, or to make it this far was your goal from the start. This is where many adaptations place their white flags and wave to the rest of the world. In anime, this is where many mildly successful manga adaptations meet their end: good enough. It is rare to
                  see one soar to the top, and even beyond. And even rarer to see two. Of the same work? Now, that's a true treasure, right there. You see where I'm going with this, don't you?
Spend enough time in the community, and surely the name Fullmetal Alchemist will have been shouted from the rooftops a thousand times, at least. In this day and age, who hasn't heard of it, right? Those who have done a little homework will have realised there are actually two separate anime adaptations with that name: a 2003 one and a 2009 one. Okay, easy enough to understand. Which one do you watch? And therein lies the bigger problem. Well, in this review, I'll be taking a look at the 2009 one, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and how it fares in comparison to its elder brother. 
By now, it's a given that almost everyone will have a general understanding of the basic premise of the series: two brothers, in an effort to bring their mother back from the beyond, perform an experiment that goes horribly wrong, and so begins their journey to try to find a solution to their predicament. 
The narrative of Brotherhood is tightly-written, and quite consistent in delivery. It appears to have been a well-planned story with ideas and concepts being developed from beginning to end with seldom a pitfall. There are no stooping lows to the curve, and occasionally it peaks during moments of electric excitement. Arakawa-sensei, the mangaka, has carefully crafted a philosophical epic  which manages to seamlessly weave thought-provoking themes and high-octane action. From Plato to Nietzsche, it is clear that the work has taken a page out of some of the most influential philosophical texts ever written, and somehow combined it with its own brand of slapstick comedy and adrenaline-fuelled fights. And the ending achieves a degree of catharsis that few stories ever do. That said, this adaptation, and even the original source material, is unabashedly Shōnen in nature, more so than the 2003 anime. Overall, the tone of the series is significantly lighter and warmer in contrast to the tragedy-loving 2003 adaptation, despite the underbelly of darkness lurking throughout both. Moreover, for some viewers, the first fourteen episodes will appear to be incredibly rushed or paced rather poorly in comparison to the remainder of the show, and some speculate that this was a conscious decision, to speed through the parts already covered by the 2003 adaptation. Whether or not that is true, I cannot say.
Brotherhood has a much larger ensemble than its predecessor, but manages to develop the major players as well as the original. Nobody is perfect, and the story does well to highlight the flaws in each and every single character, including our beloved protagonists and heroes. Many of the antagonists act as interesting and memorable foils for our heroes and will be remembered for years to come. While some may argue that the 'Big Bad' wasn't really all that much, in my opinion, they were actually a fantastic antithesis to Edward. The 2003 anime on the other had a much smaller cast, but as a result allowed a deeper look into many characters who were not as prominent in the manga or 2009 anime. 
So, reader, should you watch the 2003 anime or Brotherhood? Easiest answer: watch both of them, and if you end up liking them, check out the manga! On the other hand, for those of you who want to make a concrete decision, then it is better to see them for what they are. They are different shows. The 2003 anime is a dark, character-piece which delves into the lives and tragedies of our main characters as they realise the truth of their world. Brotherhood is the epic journey of two brothers and their friends as they uncover the truth behind their world on the path to redemption. 
And with that, I bid you adieu.",9
"
                Well now.  I've now seen this one.  I don't know if there's anything I can say that hasn't already been said much better by other people, but here we go.
Pros:
- Probably the greatest story ever told in anime.  The calmer moments, the action scenes, and even the backstory moments do nothing except aid the story resulting in one of the greatest climaxes and conclusions I've seen maybe ever.
- Amazingly fleshed out characters which the audience is able to relate with you watch them on this massive, epic, journey.
- Villains are written great as unlike a lot of shows/movies/etc. they pose an actual
                  threat.  There are no OP protagonists here.  Each character is given very believable strengths and weakness that make the action scenes that much more entertaining and awesome.
- Japanese voice actors do a flawless job for these characters (especially Edward).
- Soundtrack is great.  It feels very cinematic and huge which is perfect for this anime which also feels very cinematic and huge.
- Animation looks quite good also.  The final 10 or 15 episodes especially stand out in my memory as having very good art and animation quality.
- Some interesting ideas thrown around regarding the place and purpose of government in society.  There's actually quite intelligent commentary throughout about how a country can disservice it's people simply by being overpowered and lacking transparency and mutual trust with its citizens.
- Without giving anything away (although I'm sure most of you know by now what I'm referring to) Thanks a lot episode 4, you now have the distinction of being the first anime episode that was so screwed up that I had to take a break from this series altogether.
Cons:
- Not really a legitimate criticism, but this series suffers from a serious case of sakuga.
- While I do think such a grand-scaled story deserved to have tons of characters in it, I do think that maybe there were possibly a bit too many characters (mostly minor ones).  Often there'd be characters that were introduced in a couple episodes and served a purpose for that arc, and then about 20 or 30 episodes later they'd show up out of the blue after I'd forgotten about what purpose they served earlier.  Kind of a minor nitpick, and one that's mostly due to the fact that midway I took an extended break from it, but I still think it is something that needs addressing.
Overview:
The best way I can describe this anime is that it's sort of like a Japanese, steampunk version of Lord Of The Rings.  Similar to Lord Of The Rings it is a massive story that needs to be visited at least once in your life.  So much goes on throughout the course of this 64 episode series that the only way they could have done it true justice is by adding 64 more episodes.  For what we got, though, it still manages to captivate the audience and engage it in the journey of these heroes whose quest descends deeper and deeper into hidden, undesired, truths taking their journey in many different directions.  This is truly one of the most fascinating epics I've encountered, and I highly recommend it if you are looking for a fantastic fantasy adventure that is intelligent and adult it nature while also being very accessible and not overwhelmingly complex.  An absolute recommendation.  See it now if you haven't already.",10
"
                Oh. My. Goodness. At first, I was hesitant to watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood since I don't typically love watching Shounen anime but I figured that since this was the highest rated anime of all time on MAL, I'd give it a shot. And in my opinion, it definitely lived up to its hype.
What first drew me in to FMAB was the first opening, Again by Yui. Even knowing that it had such a high rating on MAL, I still didn't really want to watch it. But after hearing Again, my mind switched to ""I have to watch it-- for the opening."" And after watching that
                  first episode, I was drawn in immediately by the plot line, wanting to figure out the story, the humor, everything just fit well together and made for an amazing first episode.
The characters grew dear to me over the span of these 64 episodes. I cried with them, screamed, laughed. There's a perfect blend of adventure and seriousness which is balanced out with some humor but not overly cheesy or overdone. Given that it's a much longer anime than most others (that are usually not shounen anime), it only makes sense that I, in a sense, miss the characters and miss the fact that there isn't anything left to watch. However, I know that the story ended at a great place and that if there was even one more episode, the story would have been dragged out too much (though I wouldn't have minded a little segment of their lives afterwards...)
The score that I give it, a 10, isn't a score that I usually give to any great anime. FMAB really was a great anime that I will hold near and dear to my heart and that I will miss the fact that I can't watch it for the first time ever again.
All in all, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is most DEFINITELY an anime with watching, that is, if you haven't already seen it.",10
"
                One of the best anime I have ever seen, a masterpiece.
WARNING, THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS!
Story: 10
No cliches or overused things from other animes. There are also no lame/boring transformations. It only has 1 arc, which is pretty unique cause it's not a seasonal anime.  This is also the very first anime that made me cry (For example, Hohenheim's death) and after finishing it, I felt empty, I didn't know what to do after that without this anime.
Art: 10
The art and animation is absolutely amazing! Good fighting animations, effects, backgrounds, and a lot more. So, it gets a 10.
Sound: 10
It doesn't really have the best soundtracks, but it definitely has some great ones. I remember back when they were preparing for the promised day and then the 4th opening sound started before ending the episode. That thing hyped me up. And this is also the first anime that made me watch all the openings without skipping them, in every single episode.
Character: 10
It has awesome characters. Ed doesn't really train like other main characters do, instead, we have Winry to make better automails for him and that's how he gets stronger. And this is one of the first animes that made me like a few characters in only the first 10-15 episodes. Mustang, Hawkeye, Father, Hohenheim, Ed, Al, Winry... So many great characters with awesome designs.
Enjoyment: 10
Do I really have to even talk about this? I was able to watch up to 10 episodes/day of it... Which is pretty bad cause I finished it fast.
Overall: 10/10 A masterpiece.
P.S This is my first review, so I hope it's good.",10
"
                This was the first anime that I have watched all the way through.
When I first went to watch FMAB, I had no idea what it was. The only reason I started watching it in the first place was because I saw the opening theme and was drawn in by the catchy opening and animation. So when I watched it, I was no disappointed with what I watched.
This was also the anime that got me into it as a whole. I watched FMAB a while back and saw it as just another cartoon (yes, yes, don't annihilate me for calling it a cartoon) but I got
                  attached to the characters as I watched on and on. It made me happy, it made me sad and pretty much every other emotion. When I pushed through all the 64 episodes, I left saying simply ""wow."" Because it blew my mind.
The art in FMAB was pretty great and gave it a ""feel good"" type feel to it. The character designs were also great as each character was different, even the background ones which really shows how good it is.
The characters were all outstanding. From the Elrics, Winry, Mustang, Hawkeye, Armstrong, Scar, all of them! They were all unique and I found it hard to hate them (except you Shou Tucker.)
Honestly, there's a reason this is #1 on MAL, if you haven't watched it already... DO IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR.
DO IT",10

                One of the greatest shows of all time, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is exactly what a shonen anime should be. It has lots of action, a great world, great characters and everything it needs. My favorite part of Fullmetal Alchemist was it's take on power scaling. Unlike other anime, where characters get more powerful throughout, in Fullmetal Alchemist the protagonists stay consistent power wise while only maturing emotionally. The animation was also stayed top notch. The plot is also interesting enough so even if an episode is just talking, it remains engaging. It also handles mature themes well while not being edgy, and retains a funny
                  side to most interactions. There are actual stakes, and the show actually ends unlike other shonen which drag on for a hundred episodes. This has no filler, and if a website labels certain episodes as filler ignore it and watch all 64 episodes. I can strongly recommend this to any anime fan.",10
"
                one of best anime in the history of anime. period. 
plot is amazing, characters are well-developed, and the soundtrack is stunning. there is not a single boring moment in this show, and it brought me so much laughter and tears. absolutely touching story of two brothers and their journey of self-discovery. the way this show portrayed alchemy is something very refreshing too, and delves into the themes of sacrifice and exchange. although this is a fantastical show, many of the lessons learned and themes explored are applicable in real life too.
all in all, a beautiful masterpiece that all anime fans should watch. whether you like
                  it or not, you will take away something from this show.",10

                In all my years of living, I was holding off this show. I am not an avid anime watcher, but when me and my brother were bored one day in June of 2018, we came across Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. I knew about this show, but very little of it. Me and my brother agreed to watch it and now that it's almost been a year since we've finished this show, we both agreed that it changed our lives. This show has no plotholes, no filler, no bullshit. This anime will always keep you on your toes and the way everything comes together so perfectly in
                  the last half of the show has to be the result of the most genius writing I have ever seen. Every single character is so loveable and well written, I found myself loving the way Hohenheim was hinted at being this good-for-nothing father and then revealed to be the most selfless, kindest, father to exist. The main duo Ed and Al will always have a special place in my heart for giving me laughter and tears. The females of this show are absolutely GOD TIER. All of them are strong, intelligent, and play an extremely important role in helping Ed and Al get their bodies back. All in all this has to be the greatest piece of entertainment I've ever watched! I will definitely be rewatching it for the rest of my life. Happy 10th-anniversary FMAB!",10
"
                Honestly, there are lots of anime I do not like and it is really difficult for me to enjoy some. I tried watching Fullmetal Alchemist a couple of years ago. But I ended up passing on it. Later on I found out the Brotherhood version is the one to go. So I watched it on Netflix. And man.. Do not regret a single thing. First of I did not think much of it, neither did I get why it was a masterpiece. But finishing it, I started to search for the song, reading about it etc etc. I grew more and more fascinated with it.
                  Ever since, I have re-watched it a couple of times and even got my boyfriend into it. I totally love the intro and outro songs, and I love show this anime made me laugh but also cry a lot. I totally love it, never got my eyes of the screen one single bit. I love it, totally worth the hype, outstanding anime. Would even see it as a classic later on in life.",10
"
                I just finished this anime and I'm in an incredible void and mixed feelings don't know where to start.
Story: Has a gripping and creative story
Art:The illustrations and animation quality were great
Sound: Their opening, endings and OST were good, especially the first opening was indispensable
Character: I can say that I love all the characters. (Father and Gluttony are off this list)
Enjoyment: I had a lot of fun in comedy scenes
Overral: It was really a great anime in every way, it became my favorite anime in the 30th episode. I recommend it to anyone reading this, watch it before it's too late.

                This anime is just a straight up 10, simple as that. It's beautiful and fascinating, and it's a good manga adaptation, unlike the '03 version which had a terrible ending, this one closes the story with perfection. Glorious soundtrack and animation are part of this masterpiece, you can watch as many episodes per day as you like and not get tired, you will just want more and more.
I consider this to be the best anime out there and I'll probably keep thinking like this for a long time.  I'm sorry for the '03 version fans, but this one is the deal.

                A must-see for all anime fans. By far my favorite anime. FMAB takes all anime cliches and puts a huge twist on them, keeping the viewer tuned into the show at all times. This show somehow finds a way to me laugh, cry, and keep me on the edge of my seat constantly. The rewatchablity is insane. If you have seen this show once, I highly recommend you rewatch. I have seen the show 4 times now and I still find myself on the edge of my seat the whole time. The story telling elements are un-rivaled. I can't say much else other than this
                  is my favorite show of all time",10
"
                Okay, so I'm coming back to this show which is commonly praised as one of, if not, the best anime of all time. Now, we have to consider these many different things that make this anime what it was. This show may start off slow, but gradually hikes up the pace making it big on the anime scene, especially since it had another adaptation before. As this is my second review, take this with a grain of salt.
Story-10: As a piece of Shounen trash, I decided to watch this show. Why? I don't know. I at first thought that it would just be FMA with
                  slight changes. What was actually changed caught me by surprise and made me more intrigued. Of course there are moments where you first think, wow, this is just not as great as I would expect it to. And you're right, but this show always picks up the pace and makes it interesting when it matters. It seems that this show is always trying to hype up some piping hot action. This would seem worthless and stupid, yet this show manages to bring some of the strongest plot points in the anime world. Thus, a 10 would suffice in my book.
Art-8: Now, to the art in this show. The art is spectacular, when the animation team is actually working hard. Sometimes the team tends to either save their budget for later, which is much more commendable, or they're just being lazy. The show has some amazing art and shows how deep the plot points are meant to go. It makes great use of some art, though some points make me feel like I'm watching a kids show. Overall, the show has great art, it's just the occasional bad art that prevents me from making this go any higher.
Sound-9: The sound in this anime is one of those soundtracks that make you endorsed in the show. It makes you feel the emotion the crew wants you to feel. Sound is very important, and this show clearly recognizes it. It makes great use of its abundant equipment and makes it so that the viewers can connect with the characters and keep interest. I would give this a 9 for those following reasons.
Character-9: If you've watched the show, you will either disagree or agree. This is coming from a guy who thinks that they have good personality. Sometimes the characters do things that just seem out of the ordinary and don't tend to make the cut for me. However, their backstory has an extremely heavy point in the show, and though this might not be convincing to other people, to me, this is something that would be important for this show, as it brings the plot into perspective and allows full endorsement. That's a 9 in my book.
Enjoyment-10: What I care most about, is my enjoyment. I'm just gonna say that I enjoyed very thoroughly. 10 outta 10.
Overall-10: Now, I personally think that this show lives up to its name, but if you have a different opinion, it's fine. This show to me, brings out the greatness of what anime can be, and I hope to see things like this in the future.",10
"
                I usually dont review shows that I didnt finish, but here I will have to make an exception, since FMA is the highest ranking anime on this site. To put it bluntly this has to be one of the biggest disappointments I have ever experienced.
My expectations were high when the show started and the show 100% delivered. The first quarter or so is pure kino and if the show ended there, it would be an easy 10/10. Sadly it didnt. Instead I had to watch as the plot slowed to a complete crawl. Seriously, in the first section of the show the plot was running
                  forward (but it wasnt rushed) and then out of nowhere, it feels like the show completely ran out of gas. Dont get me wrong, it doesnt just stop and stand in place, but you could see that it is rapidly loosing speed and you can only watch and hope that the engine will turn back on. At first I kept watching but when it slowed to a complete crawl, I just opened the door and let myself out. I feel no need to ever finish this show and I am honestly not interested in watching it crawl to its destination where the wheels will turn for a last time and then rest.
So this is my review. I could talk about the animation or music, both of which were good, but what would be the point? Even the best looking and sounding car in the world is completely worthless if it refuses to move. For me FMA brotherhood stands as a grim reminder of what could have been, if only the engine didnt break.",5
"
                I remember season 1 FMA but it don't follow parts of Manga story.. but I don't remember too much about it. I enjoy watch old and new: Brotherhood. I had hard missed for new FMA brotherhood ep. I only I have seen ep. 1-11 and parts like 20-25. I puts sound rated 9..well because I can't hear that very well only i can feel that..I don't understand about Voice Actors i mean I'm born deaf...=/ I only watch with subs. So i checked my anime list until I noticed FMA: Brotherhood rated: R? What's that? =/ I know some people say foul words but I
                  mean come on? I just wonder want ask you guys do you really think rated of R or not still PG-13? i just want know of that. o.o It's sound strange to me.. I..don't like how that rated 'R'... >.>",10

                Story 10/10
The story is just perfect. The story follows the adventures of Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric. They try to bring back their mother to life using alchemy. However, the experiment goes terribly wrong, Alphonse's body is destroyed and Ed loses a leg and arm. Edward is able to save Alphonse by putting his soul in a suit of armor. They then go on a adventure to try to bring their bodies back.
The story looks really simple, but it is told in a beautiful way and very well paced. I like how they added humor as well and it is perfectly timed.
Art 10/10
The art is
                  very nice and beautiful. I really don't have much to say here.
Sound 9/10
The openings and endings are very nice. My favorite opening and ending is the fourth one. The music for fight scenes are really nicely done as well. I put 9/10 because I felt like the third ending could've been better but nonetheless all the songs are really good.
Character 10/10
The characters are very nice. If I had to say a criticism of anime a bit is that they develop some characters really well (explaining their past and all of that), but they don't do that with other characters. Why can't they do that with all the characters? Well, FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood develops all their characters. I like every single character as they all serve the story in some way. Also, their villains are developed, which is also a criticism I have of anime sometimes is that the villains can be very one-dimensional at times.
Enjoyment 10/10
I really enjoyed this anime series better than the first FullMetal Alchemist series (2003). I had a lot of issues with the 2003 series because the pacing was really slow and I really couldn't deal with it. FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood just fixes all the issues. I loved every bit of it.
Overall 10/10
This anime is a MUST WATCH for any anime fans and people looking to get into anime. FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shonen in a way and even though you don't like shonens, you gotta watch this! This anime really sets expectations for what other animes should be like in a way. If you're looking to understand Edward's story, just watch like the first 15 episodes of the 2003 version, but really just watch FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I highly recommend it!
Thanks for reading. Let me know your thoughts on this review and any feedback you may have for me. Until next time!",10

                This was the first anime that I watched, and is my favorite of all time. I don't have much to say since enough has already been said. The only gripe I have with this anime, which is very very minor, is that the romance between Ed and Winry wasn't fleshed out as well as it could have been but in the end, it's still such a small thing.
But I have to write more so I guess I'll do so oof.
The story is great. There really aren't many plotholes that I can point out. The pacing is overall great, albeit the beginning was fairly slow. Each
                  arc shows development within the two main characters while fleshing out the world. There are no story arcs that feel unnecessary. Overall, I think that it's a flawless story. 10/10
The art, while it is great, I won't give it a 10/10. This is purely because I've seen animes that look better. But of course, with Bones being the animators, the show itself looks fantastic. Also the openings. MMMMMMMM the openings. They are all fantastic and are some of the best that anime has to offer. 9/10 overall
The music in FMAB is fantastic also. Sometimes, I just listen to the OST for the heck of it. The only ""negative"" I can say about the soundtrack is that Brothers from the 2003 adaptation is missing. 10/10
The characters are also amazing. Every character, heroes and villains alike, get so much character development or have fleshed out backstories. An obvious standout is Ed. He develops from being a snotty brat who is very cocky and is easily riled up. However, after everything happens within the story, he matures and makes decisions that he would'nt've done so in the beginning. 10/10
Enjoyment gets a 10/10. I mean... it's my favorite anime of all time so there isn't much to be said about that.
Overall, this anime gets a 10/10 from me. As I previously said, I think that this is basically a perfect anime so a 10/10 is an obvious score from me.
Anyways I'm basically done with this cyall",10
"
                Even though I'm watching anime for a long time,I hadn’t watched FMAB.Now,Finally I've completed it.
Story-9.5
The plot of FMAB was unique & different for a shonen anime.The story is great from first to last.The ending is definitely one of the best.The themes/philosophies are also great & very mature as a  shonen.I've decreased 0.5 because sometimes it looks like the story is going nowhere.
Character-8.5
The protagonist Edward Elric can be a bit annoying & childish on sometimes but still I'd say he is one of the best shonen protagonists.The Side characters are also great & likeable.Most of the characters are also well devoloped.FMAB is one of those
                  Anime's wgere every charcater has importance & role in the story.The villains are also good sepcially King Bradley.
Fights-8
The power system was pretty.Fights were average but I expected more from the fights.
Animation/Art-9
I personally really loved the artstyle.The animation is very great compared to it’s time.
Soundtrack-8
Soundtracks are fine.Didn’t like them that much but OP's werw great especially Rain & Again.
Before watching FMAB,I thought it would be generic overrated shonen like AOT,Demon Slayer,Bleach,Dragon Ball Z but nah,I was wrong about this show.It doesn’t focus on only one element but it has almost everything done perfectly.It’s Jacks of all genre but king in none.It’s one of those shows which can be considered as perfect.It might not come in my favourites & it’s not the best anime but it deserves the ratings & position.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood really shows the endeavors of two brothers as they advance in the road of life and alchemy. Hiromu Arakawa has truly done an excellent work with her art. With these mentioned, I personally like this show for the simple fact that it shows uniqueness in some way such as the use of alchemy to defeat enemies. With the balance of comedy and action, FMAB has become a top ten in my list and has become successful to most readers and viewers.

                Full metal alchemist: Brotherhood is a classic. I have given this anime a 10, because if there is one show I would want to give a friend who hasn't watched anime yet it is full metal alchemist, OG or brotherhood either one works in my opinion. The way this anime is driven and revolves around it's plot is a great middle group for those just getting into anime. This anime earns it's wide reputation for it's unbelievably well told 'journey' story for the Elric brothers. I love the adventure and the action present in this anime. Brotherhood is worth the watch, it has made an
                  incredible improvement from the original anime whose storyline wasn't as phenomenal as brotherhood's was. Personally I still recommend watching the original full metal alchemist first, because it is still an amazing show and the two shows are so different that both can be watched without worrying about overlapping story information too much.",10

                what a great anime. so here's my review :
Story : 9/10
i really love the story. first episode is not that good but after that episode, i found it interesting although there's some episode that i dont really like it (because its boring). i love the final arc, i got curious in every episode and unexpected thing happened in every episode. i really like that ""unpredictable"" story.
Art : 7/10
i appreciate the staff(the animator) effort but its not that great or bad so i will say that its good. 
Sound : 10/10 
i really love the soundtrack wtf. i dont really like the op/ed (only 1st op
                  that i really like lol)  but i truly in love with the original soundtrack. my fav ost is trisha lullaby. the ost suits so well with the episode 
character : 10/10
i dont have a fav character in this anime but all the characters are likeable. and one thing that i like the most is the bond between edward and his brother. i swear they are very cute. i wish i had a lovely brother like edward lol. but sometimes i dont like edward because he's too naive i mean you need to kill the enemy but its a no for him lol (but i still like him tho)
Enjoyment : 10/10
i really enjoy it. back then i was curious with them i mean will they get a happy ending?or sad ending? thats why i kept watching it until last episode. one thing that i hate about the ending is WHY MUSTANG AND HIS SUBORDINATE CANT BE A COUPLE GDI. and one thing that i really like because i love their adventure its interesting and outstanding. (tbh action and adventure are my fav)
overall : 10/10
this anime will always be my 3rd fav anime",10
"
                This is a very good anime. If you are looking for an action anime I would not recommend this. Sometimes I felt. Bored with some episodes. The story is amazing and gets you hooked right from the second episode. The characters are good and have realistic goals. Also, the alchemy system causes characters to not be OP.
 The sound is amazing but can get repetitive. My second favorite anime.
The characters are simple but realistic as I said above. Alachemy is original and makes the show already better with an already amazing plot. A true piece of art alongside classics like death note 
              ",10
"
                I'm always very picky about that anime series I watch and usually watch anime with many episodes so I have time to process the story and tie with the characters, if that makes sense. But for some reason, even though I liked the plot, I loved the characters, the art everything, I was never hyped up to watch the next episode. It was more like I was bored watching it, while other animes, I couldn't wait to see the next episode. I don't know why, but I just can't find THAT SOMETHING to keep me going. Like, I thought that when I started watching, the
                  way the story progresses and the events that take place would make me GASP and like, make me hyped up to see what happens next, but never have I been hyped up to come home to watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. And even though this has such high rankings, from me as well, I find it weird for this particular anime to have higher rankings than animes that, I think are more to everyone's liking and get you hyped up.
THAT'S JUST ME BEING WEIRD THOUGH, SORRY, SORRY",8
"
                First off, I'd like to start off by saying that FMAB is my first anime ever so bias is inevitable. However I will try to address the criticisms. Do note that while criticisms exist, they do not take away from my personal overall enjoyment of the series. Others might see it differently which is completely fine. I'm writing this review because lots of people in the anime community believe FMAB to be overrated. While I might not change your point of view, hopefully I can at least give you some reasons why some people (including myself) believe it to be one of the, if not
                  the best anime of all time. I don't think it is necessarily a masterpiece, nor is any anime, but I believe it be very close. Every anime has its flaws, that is inevitable. However, what makes something a good anime is how its highs outweigh its lows and how others perceive the flaws.
Story (9/10) FMAB is an anime packed with twists and turns, an incredible journey throughout its whole. It's written with such delicacy and care, and strings along the viewer. There's a strong aspect of mystery surrounding the homunculi (main villain group) and their origins but there's something that makes that mystery incredible. We are given bits of info at a time that lead us to make inferences. And then those inferences are proven to be not quite right-in fact what we are given is far more exciting than what we had imagined. We are never given too much exposition or lore at once but at the same time FMAB is always making us ask the questions. And thankfully, unlike some anime that raise questions and don't answer them, FMAB does the opposite. It'll answer questions and then bring new ones to the surface. Or partially answer them wanting us to crave for more. And when the big reveal finally arrives it is incredibly epic. Lots of people criticize the first arc as being rushed, but personally, I think it does exactly what it needs to. Lots of anime dwindle on the setting up the plot but FMAB gets right to the point and gives us 10-13 episodes of action packed goodness right off the bat. I will say however, the Briggs arc was far too slow. It introduced the worst villain (Sloth) and the plot slowed down from its previous pace. However, the briggs arc sets up an amazing final arc which I think makes up for it. The Final Arc is perfect. It flows so well from battle to battle that it all feels like one massive final battle. It's epic and militaristic filled to the brim with emotion and high stakes. It embodies the desperation of the Brother's improbable quest and the journey to the final segment. Finally, all the arcs flow very well. Everything is relevant and nothing is forgotten. The only episodes that are one offs are the two fillers. The story get progressively more hopeful as it continues. Additionally events in the the first arc very relevant in the final arc.
Art (10/10) Not much to say here. I'm not huge on animation in general in anime so long as it's not Ex-Arm or Berserk. The animation was great for its time and still looks great now. Particularly the homunculi regeneration animations were impressive. The chibi very much retains its manga style which pays homage to the manga and I believe enhances the experience. 
Sound/Music (10/10) The OST of FMAB fits perfectly. When it needs to be suspenseful the music is suspenseful, when it needs to be militarily grandiose it is epic, when it needs to be sad it is tragic. When listening to the OST on its own, you can even visualize the scenes that certain music is played in.
Character (10/10) This is definitely the most impressive aspect of FMAB. EVERY CHARACTER STAYS RELEVANT. Ed are not given too much power and require each other to balance one another. Ed is an alchemical genius but is lacking in combat. Al is vice versa. Together they are a strong duo but without each other they are limited. Ed in particular fights smarter, not harder. He doesn't sat some anime cliché when he loses like: ""I wasn't strong enough"" There is no boring training arc. He simply outsmarts the opponent when it is appropriate. He never wins a fight he shouldn't be able to win. The narrative digresses the focus from Ed and Al to all the side characters on several occasions.  They all matter in the grand scale of things and fit perfectly in the beautifully written work of art that is FMAB. For one, the female characters are given more justice than almost any shonen out there. They are strong willed and take the lead while still preserving their femininity. Winry doesn't need to be a hard ass. She is Ed's mechanic and yet she is given so much more than that. Olivia is FMAB's answer to the Damsel in Distress cliché. Characters are not one note. They are given multiple dimensions and each have their own unique philosophies that are complex. For example, Kimblee is a psychopath, but he also serves as a realist to put Ed and Al's outlandish goals into perspective. He values non hypocrisy and consistency, something that the narrative needs. The side characters are all so relevant and this is barely touching the surface of all the characters.
Enjoyment (10/10) If you couldn't already tell. I love this series more than is probably healthy. I enjoyed every second of it. FMAB is often critiqued for its comedy, especially in the first arc when it is the most dark. Often, people say that the comedy takes away from the dark moments. But I think it balances out the darkness, not making it too edgy.
Overall (10/10) If you're looking for an anime with an incredible story, fitting music, a balanced magic system, a unique shonen, epic moments, deep themes, an amazing journey, a classic that lives up to the hype, then I highly recommend giving brotherhood a shot. Episodes 1 and 27 are optional and the dub is phenomenal (arguably better than the sub, which is not common) The manga is also great and has some cut content the anime does not include. Enjoy!",10
"
                A fantastic story of humans, hubris, humility (or lack thereof), self-sacrifice (or lack thereof), well-deserving of its reputation.
The ending in perticular was a highpoint, a heart-wrenching gentle going into that good day.
(I feel like alchemy mechanics could have been better explored: as it is, the characters' plans seem to often to come out of nowhere. You need to understand a magical system in order to be satisfied with narative solutions derived from it.
Also, the uniforms have been an eternal eyesore all throughout. I get what aesthetic and influences they were going for, and their flaws as military uniforms are all greater for it. How are
                  those skirts attached to the belts? What happens to those rectangular flaps when unbuttoned - historically those lapels on coats and tunics have started as out as perfectly normal, to be maybe later slightly stylised - but this!? Blergh, I'm ranting about nothing.)",9
"
                From when I watched this show for the first time to 3 years later, I have probably rewatched this show 7 or 8 times in full as well as going back to story arcs that I especially love and rewatching them separately. This show is a gift that keeps on giving. The thing that makes the show so good is the fact that the author weaves dark and deep thematics into a relatively digestible story, even for people who are just watching the show for the sake of enjoyment. There is not a single episode that is a filler and everything scene and development in
                  the story leads to character development or adds to the tension and builds up till the climax. Out of the hundreds of anime I've watched, I've yet to find another that has beat this one for me. Absolutely outstanding.",10
"
                ah! My first review...and of course, i should pay the homage to the GOD-dIest tier anime, the GOAT- Full Metal Alchemist BROTHERHOOD.
I am using capital for 'brotherhood' so that you don't get confused with its ""elder brother"" Full Metal Alchemist.
A MINOR SPOILER : The armor wearing guy is not the 'full metal'.
The runt looking guy is.
There is no need to even review it. Just watch it blindly and let its magic( plot) unfold.
When parallel storylines intersect and everything makes sense and the sense of satisfaction....ah YOU know its gonna be good. I believe that if there are more genres, the anime gets the license to
                  explore more emotions and sometimes you will be laughing, sometimes crying, mystery, supernatural shit, gore....ah just keep naming it and i swear this anime has everything.",10

                I know FMA from the adaptation of 2003 and I was a little disappointed of what I watched. Six years later this anime came out with the idea of been more true to the manga and I didn't doubt a second in jumping to watch it. No regrets.
Pros:
The story is rich and interesting, full of unique characters that fill the journey and the end is really satisfactory. The music goes really well, having some pieces that are memorable and personally is phenomenal that I could watch the main characters grow physically during the show.
Cons:
I'm not to fan of having this anime moments when the characters
                  became like simplified in post of been funny, because, in my opinion doesn't fit with the feeling the anime gives, but I'm glad that this moments are not used to frequently. 
There is one scene that piss me off because one of the villains is monologing when it looks like the same villain is in a hurry, and one of the characters has a broken ability that never uses properly because is too broken and will probably ruin the story.
Beyond that the show is one of my favorites and every one should watch it, is too good to don't do so.",10
"
                Number one on this site for a good reason. A show with fantastic music, very solid animation and character design, many loveable characters, a very satisfying story, and an emotional heart matched by few others. Not much to be said that hasn't already been said. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood provides an incredibly interesting world with a good magic system that is integrated into the story very well. I particularly enjoyed the fraternal bond between the two main characters that drove the story throughout, which helps to ground the story given the huge cast of supporting characters. The thematic content dealing with war, revenge, and family gave
                  the story an interesting message that gives good thematic grounding to the setting. Also, the dub voice acting is great, providing fitting, distinct, and memorable voices for the vast array of characters, so for anyone who prefers dub, this anime is a solid choice. Highly recommended.",9
"
                To put it simply, this version of Fullmetal Alchemist blows the socks off of the original.  While some people say that it is close to the manga, I myself have not read the manga so I do not know whether this is true or not.
Story 10:
The story at first is awkward if you have seen the original FMA, but after about two episodes this no longer really matters.  Unlike the original everything is wrapped up into a tight ball, with out any strange occurrences that end up having no real effect on the over all story.  The story pulls you along very
                  nicely and to be quite honest makes you want to know what happened next.  The ending does not leave a bad taste in your mouth the way that the original did.
Art 8:
There is not much to say over all on the art, as far as it goes it is above standard, but nothing spectacular.  Though it is important to note that while the basics are kept the same between the original and this one, this one does improve the over all artwork.
Character 10:
I always loved the characters from the original, and they are depicted even better in this one in my own personal opinion.  
Overall 9:
Now while I think that this is a phenomenal anime, and all, it only gets a great on over all because though it has so many good qualities, it is still lacking in a few areas.  Though I honestly recommend that any one who is interested in this anime should take the time to watch it.",9
"
                10/10 Masterpiece, right up there with the best shounen of all time like HxH, One Piece, One Punch Man, and Bleach.
The story is dark but not too dark for a shounen, and the way the mysteries are unveiled, the world is built, the political tension, and the moral issues of racism, war, genocide, and revenge is just great.
The Art is so detailed and the animation is so clean that you know the animators just put a lot of love into the show because it was worth it.
The sound is so good it amplifies all the fight scenes, tension scenes and emotional scenes, the selection and
                  timing is just perfect. The openings and endings are also bangers. Voice acting in sub is just perfect.
Characters are written so well to make them endearing and each with their own unique traits and characteristics. When you think you've seen all the characters, bam another new one comes in and they are instantly like-able. Even the villains are written so well that you love to hate them.
This show is so enjoyable and so rewatchable, I've seen it multiple times.
All in all, this is the benchmark for a great shounen anime.",10

                ""In order for something to be obtained, something of equal value must be lost.""
Ok I just copied that from the synopsis
Story: 9.2/10
The series follows the story of two alchemist brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who want to restore their bodies after a disastrous failed attempt to bring their mother back to life through alchemy.
FMAB's story is refreshing and captivating. There are many tragic moments in the Anime. Many people complained about the first few episodes being rushed, I for some reason didn't really feel the same way. Interesting setting and world building kept me engaged. Story's narration was impressive. The only problem I faced was
                  the bad comedy, It decreased the overall enjoyment by a little bit
Art: 8/10
Not the best I wanted honestly, The characters has very simple design and art style is cartoonish. But the colors were pleasing to my eyes and the action scenes were drawn out very well. FMAB's light yellowish vibe and European setting is the first thing that flashes in my eyes when I think about it
Soundtrack: 9/10
FMAB's soundtrack is very consistent. All of it's OP and ED are insanely good. For the OST's I think they could've increased the variety but still great nevertheless
Character: 8.8/10
Ed and Al aren't much good. But Roy Mustang is the definition of a true badass character, too bad Levi imitated him and got more popularity. FMAB has strong female character such as Riza Hawkeye and Olivier Armstrong. They introduced the Xingese character which weren't in original FMA and they did a pretty good job. The main villians are extremely well written for a shonen. Most shonen features absolutely dumb villians, FMAB is a good exception
Enjoyment: 9/10
FMAB is constantly praised for it's appeal to all ages. It features action, comedy, sorrow all. Both child and adult can enjoy the show to the fullest.
It's not worthy of ""Best Anime of All Time"" but it's worthy of ""Best Shonen of all time""
Overall: 9/10
It's 9 been years since it was finished but it's still so critically acclaimed. FMAB has some flaws but it's worth being loved. You must give it a try or you are missing out something!",9
"
                The number one rated show on MyAnimeList. I mean as of writing the spot is held by Attack on Titan Season 4 Part 2, but it wouldn't surprise me if this show reclaims the number one spot in the long run. It honestly isn't my favourite show, but I can see the broad appeal and excellent quality.
The first 10 episodes or so aren't that excellent frankly. They feel a bit rushed and I found them a bit boring personally. This is because they were speeding past this section of the manga, as it had been covered extensively by the original anime adaptation, Fullmetal Alchemist. I
                  understand why they did this, but it still would have been cool to see a properly fleshed out beginning of the story. But following this the show gets quite interesting, introducing new characters, motivations, information about the philosophers stone etc. This all culminates in the final arc. The ending arc is honestly peak television as people like to say, it's so damn good, and a nice length. Watching the kinda boring first episodes definitely pays off at the end, no doubt.
The character development is so damn good. It's fairly generic in a sense, but it's done so damn well. My personal favourite character would be Colonel Mustang, such a damn legend. I prefer this interpretation of him over the interpretation in the original anime adaptation actually. I like the dark side of him and how it's explored. But of course the ambition, grit and wit present in his character is so damn badass.
Whilst the show is often light-hearted, the exploration of deep themes such as war, peace, genocide etc. are some of the best factors of the show. I think Avatar the Last Airbender is similar in this regard, with both shows grappling with ethnic groups that were both brought to near extinction. The character Scar is of this ethnic group, from the nation of Ishval, and his character arc is really good. It could be argued that these themes have fairly generic feel good liberal conclusions (in the broad enlightenment sense not the left wing sense), but I still think the explorations are interesting regardless.
For a better beginning arc I think it's worth watching the original Fullmetal Alchemist adaptation before this one, but if 115 episodes of anime sound like too much I think you should just stick to this one.
The humour is criticized sometimes on the show. But I think it's mildly amusing and works well. Nothing laugh out loud but it keeps a degree of comic relief to the show and some occasionally hilarious moments. I like the recurring gag Edward does where he puts short jokes into other people's mouths and being angry at them.
I didn't care much for the opening and closing songs initially, but they've grown on me, I think they're quite solid.
There are a lot more things to discuss about this show but I'm sure other reviews have covered that well enough. It's clear that this show is a classic, and considered by many to be a masterpiece. The spot it holds in Otaku's hearts is valid in my view, I give it a 9/10.",9
"
                Before I state my opinion about the show I‘d like to say that this is an anime that holds a special place in my heart, seeing as FMA (Fullmetal Alchemist), and FMAB (Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) were my very first anime series (well, not including the Pokemon, Naruto and etc. episodes I used to watch on TV as a kid). These were the series that first showed me how great the anime medium can be. That said, this review may or may not be a little biased because of how special the series are for me personally.
In short I would describe FMA as a great story
                  about the adventures of two brothers, their quest to achieving their goal, their hardships along the way and how their relationship grows stronger despite that. Throw in some likable characters they interact with while on their journey, great fight scenes, lighthearted comedy and a lot of alchemy and you got a general idea what FMA is about.
Story (10)
The story has a clear goal to move towards, but it doesn’t mean that it’s the only thing you’re going to see here. There are plenty of smaller segments, that are kind of short stories of their own, but they don’t go too far off the main story. Most tie into the main story in some way or another and I don’t think I’ve seen anything that felt like it could have been skipped or was unnecessary.
My main complaint with FMAB is that the first 12 or so episodes felt rushed, but if you’d like to watch the story unfold in more detail the first 30 or so episodes of the first anime adaptation of this series (in 2003) covers mostly the same story just in a slower pace.
The beginning aside, in my opinion, FMAB beats the first adaptation in the ending department by a mile. I won’t spoil it for  you if you haven’t seen it yet, but because of this, if you only have the chance to watch one of the adaptations, I’d recommend watching brotherhood, even though both of the adaptations have their own different charms and are worth a watch.
Art (10)
The animation style isn’t overly cute or overly rough and the colors aren’t too bright nor are they too bland. The animation is fluid and I didn’t notice any major faults with it.
I think it’s also worth mentioning that this show has one of if not the best fight scenes, especially involving some sort of magic (in this case – alchemy) that I’ve seen so far in anime.
Sound (10)
The OPs ranged from ok to good, even thought I personally liked the first adaptation’s OP songs better.
I have no complaints about the sound effects. They aren’t out of place and work well.
Personally, I have seen the dubbed version of this anime, and I have to say, the DUB is really good. The voice actors did a good job and they fit their characters well. If you like myself don’t usually watch dubbed anime because a lot of the times it just doesn’t seem to work, but don’t mind it when the DUB is good, I’d recommend at least trying the dubbed version of FMA.
Character (10)
As I have mentioned earlier, I find the characters very likable. Let’s start with the main characters – Edward and Alphonse or Ed and Al for short. The two brothers and their relationship is one my favorite parts of this show. They are smart and capable, yet not perfect. Both of them make mistakes and learn from them. Even though they share a very strong sibling bond with each other, they still disagree and fight at times. These are all things that make them believable human characters and it brings me joy to watch them change and grow over the span of the story.
The brothers aren’t the only characters that change and grow over time, though. The more important supporting characters also develop quite a bit throughout the story, including the villains.
Speaking of villains, FMA has some really good ones. I unfortunately can’t go into much detail about them without spoiling the story, but I can say for sure that I rarely ever see anime villain characters that I love, or should I say love to hate as much as I do in this show. Their motives make sense and I was even able to sympathize with some of them to an extent. Perhaps most importantly, the villains aren’t villains just for the sake of the story having someone for the main characters to defeat, but instead they are actual characters with good reasons for acting the way they do.
Enjoyment (10)
It probably comes as no surprise, when I say that I enjoyed this anime to bits. It was the first anime (well the second if you count the first adaptation as a separate anime, which I personally do not) that I’ve ever seen from start to finish, it has what I consider to be a great story with some of the best characters I’ve ever seen and it probably helps that I am very fond of elements such as alchemy, strong sibling and/or friend relationships and action in not just anime, but other entertainment mediums as well. And to top it all off – a nice and clean animation style and a fitting soundtrack, what’s there not to love?
Overall (10)
Is this anime for everyone? Well, no, I doubt such an anime exists, but that aside I think this anime can be easily enjoyed by most anime viewers. It has a great story for those that want one, great action for those that enjoy shows better when there’s a lot of movement involved, characters that feel human for those that want to see characters change and grow, comedy for those that like to have a good laugh with their anime and etc.
Fullmetal Alchemist really is a great anime, and I think it’s one that you should at least give a try to. Who knows, maybe you’ll find something else it’s worth praising for? Or maybe you’ll find the exact opposite – a major fault that has escaped my attention? Either way, I hope you give it a try.",10

                Before watching I had indeed seen the original FMA, I thought it was good a bit sketchy at times and I appreciate what they tried to achieve with that series. But one problem with that series is that it didn't get me hooked, the series pace was addled, slow at times then awfully fast, it skipped over parts that personally I thought needed explaining. And the ending I found to be too ambitious as you have to watch a continuation film. All the same it was fun for what it was. 
However, Brotherhood is a completely different ball game. The start of the series is
                  pretty quick as it skims over the stuff covered in the previous series so its was a bit much to take, but after that the series matured and gave a thoroughly gripping and intense story that for me was not predictable in the slightest. 
The art style shocked me when I came into watching this as it was different from FMA. It has a more simplistic style which I love especially in the humorous scenes I feel that the style adds to the hilarity. Man! the action sequences though, they were animated so beautifully and colourful. That's something Brotherhood doesn't skimp out on is the colour its vibrant and really sets a scene, from the intensity of the scenes with the antagonists to the peaceful interactions with our heroes. I would personally say that FMA has the hold over brotherhood in this area though, but the animation was still of a high standard. 
One of the very masterful things this anime achieves is almost every character in the series is so beautifully fleshed out. I found myself caring for so many characters in this series and its something ive rarely seen in all the animes I have watched. 
Ed and Al this is their show and their characters are so lovable and you're always rooting for them, Brotherhood added new elements to them which came as a shock in comparison to the original but the thing is that it made sense for some of the actions they made. But if you're reading this you should already know how good these characters are. Their dad however is almost completely different from FMA hes more developed and actually does a lot more. His backstory was a nice addition and the events that lead him to this story were great. However I didn't like how his character arc ended, it made sense but personally I disagree with it.  
Mustang was one of my highlights watching the original, I loved what he stood for and how was willing to do anything to get the best outcome and in this, they added even more compelling and emotional scenes with him which truly made me love the character even more. This series however added so much more story to his team, hawk-eyes struggle, Armstrong's heritage. Oh! did I forget to say the Armstrong's ROCKED, they were nuts from beginning to end MAN THEY WERE SO GOOD!!!
Now to the MVP, Ling. Guys Ling I feel is such a well rounded character and to have Greed be his *associate* just made me love him even more. I found him absolutely undoubtedly hilarious I was in stitches with some of the things he did. His reasoning to be there was stupid but i loved it, his willingness to achieve his goal was idiotic but I loved it. Did I mention his action sequences were stellar I personally feel that him and the Xingese have some of if not the best action sequences and their fighting style was SO GOOD! so yeah if you haven't already guessed I liked Ling.
The Homunculi were incredible antagonists in this series, I liked them better in this series rather than the previous because in the previous I felt like the traits they had were way too predictable, and they were pretty weak as well. In this series they are strong, vicious, violent and live up to their names at times I actually felt like they were going to win, they rivalled the protagonists, but man I LOVE TO HATE PRIDE!!! 
I cant end without mentioning that the Xingese characters were a shock to see enter the story as they didnt exist in the original. And they were so fresh and different compared to the characters we already had established. It was nice to see other countries in this incredibly well built world.   
The voice acting in this series is very well done, it never lacked and was encapsulating and its some of the best I've heard in anime. 
The story was compelling, always had me on the edge of my seat and rooting for everyone. The north arc possibly my favourite part of this series, as it introduces even more world building and new characters and the events that happen in that part of the series were so unpredictable, I will never forget that arc and how vital it was to the story.
So on a final not this series is incredible. It must be watched and suggest watching it after the original. I'm thankful it was suggested to me and it will forever be one of my favourite animes.",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is such a great anime. Some may say that it is kinda overrated, but for me it deserves the recognition it receives. The plot and story line is so well-written. I just love the irony and symbolisms hidden in the story. Salute to Arukawa sensei~
*Spoilers ahead, read at your own risk*（＾∀＾●）ﾉｼ
The symbolisms on the death of the homunculus never fails to fascinate me. 
Gluttony died eaten. Envy died through suicide because of his envy for humans. Lust who makes men kneel for her, died kneeling on a man who bears no lust for her. Sloth died because of sloth. Wrath died on
                  the hands of a man who conqured his wrath. Pride was reduced to an innocent and humble being which is an infant. Lastly, Greed died satisfied. 
Also, the punishments for those people who performed human transmutations is so fitting that it gave me goosebumps.
Edward and Alphonse who tried to ressurect their mother was punished. Alphonse who seek the warmth of a mother was deprived of feeling warmth. Edward who was the ""breadwinner"" of the family lost his leg to stand. Izumi who tried to ressurect her stillborn child, was taken the ability to carry a child. And Roy who has a vision to save his country lost his eyesight and the ability to see its future.",10

                I have watched the original FMA series when it first came out and even though i enjoyed it a lot. FMA Brotherhood over rides FMA because its more enjoyable, adventurous, dramatic, hilarious, everything. Dont get me wrong FMA was a great series too, however if you think that you dont need to watch FMA Brotherhood because you watched FMA..you are completely WRONG!! Basically Brotherhood focuses more on the manga story line so if you read the manga you know how amazing the story line gets. How Edward and Al meet even more people, than the original FMA series shows. FMA Brotherhood seriously had me crying,
                  laughing, smiling, anxious, etc. As the story progress's on you get more connected with Edward and Al on their journey to get there bodies back. You meet even more memorable characters like the people from Xing, you see that not all homunculus are not bad *Greed*. FMA Brotherhood also shows you the little love story developing between Ed and Winry which the original FMA series just over looked. Seriously this is a must watch series, if your a fan of FMA in general then you MUST MUST MUST watch FMA Brotherhood!! Even if you havent watched the original series FMA, you can start with FMA Brotherhood. It doesnt matter! Just know with Brotherhood your gonna be captive once you start watching it. Its hard to stop! SO GO WATCH IT! You wont be sorry, i promise that!",10
"
                “Stand up and walk. Keep moving forward. You've got two good legs. So get up and use them. You're strong enough to make your own path.”
FMA Brotherhood tells us the story of two brothers: Edward and Alphonse. They wanted so bad to return their mother's life that they used a forbidden alchemy technique in attempt to bring her back to life. Alchemy is the scientific technique of understanding the structure of matter, decomposing it, and then reconstructing it. It's based on the principle that only one thing can be created from something else of a certain mass: The Principle of Equivalent Exchange. The cost for
                  attempting to revive their mother was losing their bodies parcially or completely. Thas said, the brothers' journey for recovering their bodies using alchemy starts, having plenty of events surrounding it.
So yeah, it's pretty much a shounen anime in essence. However, Hiromu Arakawa (the authoress) revealed a complex plot, with action, comedy and drama all in the measure to bring us a well balanced plot. The story takes place in the Amestris Military State, a country that in the past was the scene of a terrible civil war that almost ended the Ishibalian race. The show is full of conspiracies and terrifying hypotheses involving alchemy and politics, all well tied with extremely captivating characters.
The characters are all great. It's amazing how a show having a large cast was able to handle it with such excellence. Ed and Alphonse stand out as one of the best pairs in shounen with their great strong motives and deeply personal bond. The support cast shines as well. Mustang and Hawkeye relationship is always fun, Scar is a highly intriguing complex villain, Hohenheim with his mysterious background and personality gives is really captivatingt, the Armstrongs are great, so as the teacher. I thought Winry would be the kind of boring useless character, judging by past experience with shounen, but I was pleasantly surprised. Everyone has a purpose, fitting very well into the story.
The anime shows us the various weakness of humankind concerning how we struggle to live inside a society in contrast to our ego and selfish desires. Humans should have a minimum of empathy for things to work out, since even the things we least imagine can be connected. If we become corrupt, it maybe disastrous. We are just humans. We can't live without consequences, as the alchemy's principle states. Plus, it has a meaningful message to take away about the cost of gain and the meaning of perseverance. It's like Ed says:
""A lesson without pain is meaningless. That's because no one can gain without sacrificing something. But by enduring that pain and overcoming it, he shall obtain a powerful, unmatched heart. A fullmetal heart.”
In addition to a fluid animation and a great soundtrack, FMA Brotherhood stands out in every area. I wouldn't say it's perfect though, since the first episode is not a good introduction and the main antagonist should get more attention, but its qualities definitely obfuscates its flaws.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist is one of my favorite anime series of all time.  When I heard there was a new Fullmetal Alchemist coming out I was excited but then I read that this would be a recreation of the original series but following closer to the manga I was disappointed.  How could they possibly make this series be better than what it already was?  This will be a complete train crash. I could never have been more wrong.
I would recommend watching the original series before embarking on Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as it allows for you to make a good comparison between the two
                  series which are both worth watching but, it’s not necessary.  
The overall plot here is essentially the same as the original Fullmetal Alchemist with some improvements in the sub plots.  The Brotherhood series is also longer than the original by 12 episodes so there is a bit more to watch.  Brotherhood has moments of excitement, action, and drama blended together with perfection making it one of my favorite plots in any anime series.  Character development throughout the show is considerably noticeable through the long adventure Ed and Al partake in.  The villains are also superbly developed doing that much more for the overall plot.
One of my favorite parts of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the music and dialogue.  The music is seamlessly sewn into the show providing emphasis when needed and enhancing the overall mood of the show.  The music is blended in so well that if you aren’t looking for it you most likely won’t even notice it.  Considerable time must have been put into the development of the dialogue.  But the subbed and dubbed versions are very nicely done and are not overly cheesy as in many series.  
There are 3 distinctive animations styles used throughout the series that may or may not be accompanied by different art styles and are often situational.  Each different style complements its situation.  I really enjoy the exaggerated and semi-elongated style used in combat.  It helps to provide a sense of intensity.
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a very fun and exciting series.  It is one of the beast shows anime has to offer and I would recommend it to anybody whether they are just getting into anime of have been watching it for a while.",10
"
                Note: I have only seen Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and have not yet seen the original anime and the manga series nor the movies. Also this is my first ever anime review. I’ve only ever written drama reviews and constructive criticisms would be appreciated.
Fullmetal is a masterpiece of an anime. Everything about this anime is fantastic. Every character has a reason, a premise, and is memorable. The art is pleasing to the eyes. The voice acting brings the characters to life and full of emotion Every ending and theme song always got me signing in my horrible Japanese. The story is engaging, yet you will need
                  tissues with every half hour 64 episode. 
Now to get in depth.  
Plot:
	The story follows two state alchemists named Edward Elric, aka Fullmetal, and his brother, Alphonse Elric. When they were younger their father left them with only their mother who then dies to a fatal illness. Which then leads to committing the ultimate sin/taboo of human transmutation. Human transmutation is essentially bringing someone back to life. Due to the first law of alchemy, equivalent exchange, Edward loses his arm and leg and Alphonse loses his entire body, but gets his soul bound to a suit of armor. We get to watch Ed and Al go through the journey of getting their bodies back. 
Story:
	Brotherhood is nothing, but story. Filler doesn’t exist in the anime and it’s amazing. You never have to wait for the plot to move along. Without having to spoil anything, you will need a emotional support. This anime had me emotional through every moment. I was even crying over the villans! You feel all the sorrow and happiness every character goes through. In the end, it feels rewarding watching everything unfold and seeing how it ends.
Sound:
       Wow did SID get a nice paycheck. All jokes aside, I loved every theme and ending song. I am someone who normal skips the openings and endings yet I found myself singing along. I personally love SID and their work and NICO Touches The Walls performing Hologram (ホログラム)  was a very nice introduction for me. Overall my favorite opening is Rain (レイン) and my favorite closing is Uso (嘘) which are both done by SID. For voice acting, I watched the dub and hearing Vic Mignogna voice Ed is always a welcoming sound. As for the rest the feeling seeping through them through every word being said made everything be very fluent.
Characters:
       I hardly ever get to say a that all characters are interesting or compelling in any t.v. show yet FMA:B breaks this rule. Every character is memorable and interesting. I can name each villain, protagonist or side character with ease. You start to care for almost every human (or non-human) that speaks.When I finished the show, I felt as if a family member died. I got so close to these characters, I honestly didn’t know what to do knowing now that I wouldn’t watch another episode with these familiar faces. I know that these characters will always live in my heart and be an inspiration for as long as live.
Enjoyment:
        I enjoyed riding the Fullmetal coaster the entire length (see what I did there?). Yes it is quite lengthy and in the beginning I did wonder how long I would keep interest. Yet as the end grew closer and closer, I didn’t want it to end! The only problem I would see people having is crying. I, myself, am a very emotional person when it comes to anime and if you’re the same then be prepared for water works. But emotion isn’t always just sadness. Through the serious times, FMA:B still found a way to make me laugh despite myself. All around, this show is the definition of entertainment.
         To conclude, FMA:B is a masterpiece of an anime. If it’s your first anime or if it’s your fifty-thousandth this is always a great pick. If you’re not into action anime, then FMA:B will change that for you. All in all, if you haven’t seen Fullmetal then change that. Trust me you won’t regret it.",10
"
                I have rewatched this 3 times; it is just too good: perfect pacing, music, visuals, and dialogue. Although I don't agree that it is the top anime of all time.
I love Alphonse because it's Rie Kugimiya. And I love Aimer.
I would put this in my non-biased top 10 of all time.
Aside from the great story, I think this anime is so good that it should be hailed as a cultural and classical legend.
My favorite part of this series is the first opening and ending; I never skipped and I hate that Netflix has a skip option.

                I loved this anime. It is most likely going to be in my top 3 favorite anime of all time. I enjoyed the first anime but this definitely does the series a lot of justice. Those of you that weren't happy with the original because of the ending or certain aspects of the story will be thoroughly impressed. It follows the manga story line which I don't think anyone will complain about. I waited weekly to watch every last episode and it's just another series that you always want to keep watching episode after episode. Highly recommended

                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a momentous achievement, not only in the realm of anime, but in the world of fiction as a whole. It is a timeless classic, and should be experienced by all. 
Story - If you ask me, a story should leave you wanting more, but also make you feel satisfied with the time that you have invested. FMA:B is the epitome of that. The story is very complex for a shonen and has so many interlinking and well-developed themes that it almost the ultimate story. The way that Arakawa handles racism, mass genocide, responsibility, death, the cycle of life and the power
                  of individuals is sublime. So much so, that there are plenty of videos and articles detailing the all of the themes mentioned as well as many more. The only thing that is somewhat disappointing is that Brotherhood specifically rushes through the earlier parts of the story and also has a pretty bad first episode in my opinion.
Characters - Arakawa understands the one most important thing a character needs to seem realistic - flaws. Each and every character in the series, whether good or evil, has a flaw in some way. From Van Hohenheim's insecurities with his immortality and his family, to Ed's rash and somewhat immature attitude to the events around him, to Fuhrer King Bradley's hypocritical view on the importance of humanity. All of these imperfections not only create clear and satisfying character development, but also allows the viewer to sympathize with them. Another thing that I like is that there are some morally grey characters too. Take Scar, for example, who doesn't necessarily ever repent the actions he's committed, even though they are objectively bad.
Art - This is FMA:B's most unimpressive aspect, at face value at least. The art is very clean and consistent but doesn't try to go too stylized. However, Arakawa's artwork shines due to how malleable it is to the current emotion trying to be portrayed. It is just disproportional enough for the comedic moments but also beautiful enough for the more serious moments.
Sound - As far as the OPs go, they are all pretty great, especially ""Again"" and ""Period"". The soundtrack in the anime itself is also quite good. It's very bombastic and atmospheric, but I do honestly prefer the marvel that was the soundtrack to FMA 2003. The voice acting in both sub and dub is exceptional, and, let's be honest, even the most die-hard dub haters will agree FMA:B's English dub is very, very good. 
Overall - Honestly, this review is kind of pointless. Everyone who is in the anime community already knows about FMA:B's legacy. After all, it is the single highest rated anime series on this site. so don't take my word for it. Take the anime community's word for it and watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
(But watch FMA 2003 first!!!!)",10

                I wasn't sure what to think of when I got into this series, I had watched the original when it came out and liked it even if it left alot of things confusing by the end, this one has a simular start, and some things are the same as it progresses, except it follows the plot of the manga more directly, and certain things are different.   And while I liked the original, I can't help but feel this is the far superior version.
Story:   Closer to the manga, and works as a over all story, I was invested in it, especially as
                  the series progressed.
Art:   I liked the artwork here, it did it's job and was colourful and everyone felt right, and it accentuated every scene perfectly, even the some times childish little reactions to things.
Characters:   This was a strong point, every villian I enjoyed and was happy when some became good, or were given more options then just being bad, the main characters felt like they had a arc and reasons for things, and I don't think there was any one I hated truly as a character, though of course a few your supposed to hate.
Enjoyment and overall:   this was well worth watching and enjoying, and I'm glad I gave it a chance as I wasn't sure about watching it after already having seen the original, and it just worked.",9

                I was immensely impressed with the 2003 adaptation, especially because most of its story was original and not entirely based on the manga, which is a big deal on the creative front. And as I finally finished watching Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood last night, I was left smiling and satisfied to a degree that hasn't yet been achieved by any other anime I've seen so far. The final act of the series, especially, gives blockbuster live-action MOVIES a run for the money, delivering god tier emotions and action.
Renaming this otherwise similarly titled adaptation Brotherhood was a great decision, because the relationship of the Elric brothers is
                  still a major driving force and their ""brotherhood"" is a treat to watch. This is a very atypical shounen when you look at the tone and tropes. The protagonists have a goal, but it much different when you compare it to other shounen anime where training and improvement are the common tropes. This is very much a mature anime even grown ups can fully enjoy, and the balanced tones between dark and extremely funny are very well balanced.
After all, Edward's funny face keeps making appearances more frequently this time.
Since I first watched the 2003 version first, the initial few episodes of FMAB felt quite fast paced and like a quick summary of the former in a way. However, it slowly developed into a different story and from that point there was no looking back. The plotting is excellent, and even the two filler episodes are a treat to watch. The voice acting is still strong here, and the characters, especially the Elric brothers, Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Scar and Fuhrer Bradley shine to their fullest. A cute and rather notable addition is Mei Chang and her tiny pet panda Xiao-Mei. However, I was most impressed with the characterization of Hohenheim, who didn't feel that impactful in the 2003 version. Here, his character is explored fully and with subtlety, and with time I found him one of the best things about the show.
And of course, the action. It is simply outstanding. Some of the fight scenes are so intensely drawn and chaotically edited that they given some serious competition to live-action fights. The final arc of the show is filled with some of the greatest fights and blockbuster moments you will ever experience in an anime or live-action work. The music is similarly apt and a treat to the ears. And again, while there are a lot of dark moments like 2003, this adaptation also adds more hilarity, as a result of which I ended up laughing far more than expected. I have to commend them also for experimenting and adding humor even in the most serious moments, which is something a lot of writers are skeptical of.
And guess what else left me speechless? That a shounen like this, where both male and female characters are equally capable and strong, is the work of a woman. Hiromu Arakawa truly has my respect for understanding both genders and delivering a highly intelligent, memorable, haunting and exciting story which is really hard to top. Once you watch this anime, your expectations and standards are going to shoot up. I loved it to the fullest and I would love to add it to my collection, along with the 2003 version of course.",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
I've watched this anime 5 times now and I'm still fascinated by how much it can overwhelm with its execution and quality. In the shounen realm, it represents the pinnacle of quality that can be achieved and therefore has a solid reputation in the anime community. The focus was not to offer fans something that any other series can do but to create an entirely new experience.  And that was excellently achieved here by removing most of the shounen clichés and keeping only minimal ones. 
Despite all the enthusiasm expressed and what's to come, I'm sadly disappointed by the anime adaptation after
                  finishing the ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" manga last week. As many know, there are ""2"" different anime of the same name, from 2003 and 2009. The older series has almost nothing to do with the original and departs far from the manga. The newer series, on the other hand, follows the manga but made the mistake of deleting many scenes that were already in the old series. You notice less of this when you are completely drawn into the series. But once you have watched it several times, you will find gaps that are present in the narratives and sequences. After reading the manga, I have to agree that this is indeed the case. So much character screentime and relevant moments and dialogue have been removed so that the anime can maintain its tension. However, this caused many characters (especially Lust and Hughes) to lose a tremendous amount of sympathy by being much emptier shells in the anime than the characters they were capable of being in the manga. 
This breaks my heart, but by making these changes, you've lost a notable amount of potential for the series that could have elevated all the ""Important and Shocking Moments"" significantly more. 
So what does this series offer? 
A very original story of two brothers who broke the absolute taboo in the world of alchemy and had to reckon with huge consequences. The brother who lost his whole body and must live on as a suit of armor and the other who lost half his body. The impressive focus of the story is also due to the great will of the characters to want to achieve their goal, whereas in most works it seems more and more secondary, so here this remains constantly in the spotlight. On the journey of the siblings, they meet many bizarre characters, but also discover the ""truth behind the truth"" which was a very interesting approach. 
Especially important points here were the plot and the characters. 
[Story 10]
Most of the points that came off the manga were mostly character-related and showed the transition of many scenes. As for the plot, it is practically as polished here as in the manga. 
And especially here, I must note how positive the creativity and implementation of this plot are. Here an effort was made to create a small world, with an immensely gloomy and shocking background. 
As the story progresses, one learns more and more about the world and the many truths that lie within it. The roots of the military, the wars, and how far everything is intertwined. Constantly receiving new revelations that have always given the story a chance, the atmosphere has practically never collapsed. The tension was completely strained.
The finale, as expected, was weaker than the whole anime, but this is never surprising. Nonetheless, the final battle was well held and especially by the respective characters and their final confrontations. Since all the mysteries had already been solved by that point, all that remained was the final clash between two fronts. 
A very rare theme of alchemy, which was set as the main concept of the story, with respective approaches, principles, and philosophy. Like one of my favorites, the Equivalent Exchange approach. This was an excellent link in the narrative to highlight the importance of not rising above the laws of something people are only trying to understand anyway. Furthermore, alchemy was very interestingly eviscerated in this story, on different branches, perspectives, and applications. Comprehension, Deconstruction, Reconstruction, the pillars of the concept.
[Characters 8]
FMAB has many notable characters that I would say had fascinating personalities and excellent development. Unfortunately, some characters didn't get out of their diapers. Especially due to the lack of screen time, some particularly popular character deaths appeared, relatively mediocre for me. The implementation was good, no question about it. But a character who didn't even have 5 minutes of screen time will die accordingly. With more material and sympathy, her final moments could almost have been shocking, this chance was wasted.
So it would be far from saying the characters were flawless here.
However, some were very close due to various interactions, representations, and developments. Take, for example, the fascinating contrast between Ling and King Bradley, who were both who were destined to be number 11 (the eleventh prince and the eleventh candidate), both held/aspired to the same position and yet possessed such a fascinating contrast.
The 2 determined protagonists, Edward Elric and Alphonse. Although Alphonse looked like a boring character at first, he was the more mature and understanding of the two. No matter what emotions tormented him, he chose the passive and controlled way of coping with situations rather than cracking them with simple force. Whereas Edward, the smarter of the two, was very explosive due to his short temper. It is noteworthy, however, that the two did not benefit from a single, but from many different character traits and also had to adapt immensely depending on the situation.
Apart from that, there were characters like Roy Mustang, who had an immensely impressive final character arc. It was simple, but the representation of his goals, actions, and how they intersected just to achieve his personal goals was remarkable.
Scar has been very similar, also driven by revenge, he was one of the best characters in the series. With probably the greatest development.
Many supporting characters also received more or less positive attention. Notable ones like Kimbley, Hughes, Hawkeye, who had smaller character arcs, but still had enough influence on the series.
It is obvious, but the ""7 sins"" the ""Homunculus"" are the best representatives of the series and the most fascinating characters. Especially Envy, Bradley, Father, Greed. While Gluttony and Lust were also interesting, they lacked a massive amount of screen time. Which kept them relatively simple. Sloth, on the other hand, was relatively boring and had hardly any points worth mentioning.
Envy and Greed were both my personal favorites. Greed, the one who wanted everything and in the end achieved more than he could ever hope for. His development, and personality, was very nice.
Whereas Envy has been the perfect symbolic representation of human envy. He was the character who probably had the greatest influence on many scenes, as well as most of the whole story. And by far one of the best endings as an antagonist I've ever seen.
The author managed to give the symbolic sins so much depth and character that it still fascinates me to this day. As ironic as each of them came to an end.
Father and Hohenheim's character arc was also very interesting and how pathetic Father's attempts to understand humanity were. The symbolism behind his actions, his greed for knowledge and power, was still reflected, even after he had given up all of his sins.
You can interpret a lot in many of the characters and find a lot of fascinating little details regarding their existence and their irony, the role they were given.
[Animations 9]
Most of the animations are attractive and colorful. Through various adaptations to the respective scenes, the atmosphere could be raised by a certain play of colors. Especially later in the Brigs Tunnel, where it was most noticeable, in the depiction of light and darkness.
The fight animations fluctuated but were mostly very dynamic for individual scenes. Since the fights in the series are relatively short, it is all the better that the budget was placed correctly. Which also supported special moments of hype with beautifully choreographed movements.
[Music 10]
The outros have varied from pleasant to relaxing and beautiful. The musical style was more recognizable. But especially with the Osts, FMAB has by far some of the best intros you can find, each with its personal quality.
The Osts are beautiful too and I could hardly choose a favorite. They were very well laid out for various scenes and could support practically all kinds of moments. Whether emotional, mysterious or fascinating.
[Conclusion]
I would generally recommend the manga to every fan of this series if you want to have the same experience but again in full format. With more character screen time, better transitions, and no cut-out explanations. I was skeptical about it at the beginning, but I don't regret it, even if it damaged the image of the anime a bit.
Nonetheless, FMAB is one of the best anime I've ever seen, one of my personal favorites, and probably the best shounen to date. Even if you can argue about it, the quality and creativity of the author are undisputed.
[Enjoyment 10]",9
"
                I'm my opinion this is not a 'masterpiece' as many people say.
The adaptaion is enjoyable but is not a  masterpiece.
The story starts off strong and as you continue to watch episodes they become less enjoyable and when you try to express your opinions you get bombarded by the community calling it a 'masterpiece'.
The middle of the story feels extremely boring and the ending is a high point.
At the final battle the thing that is wired is how everyone was just standing still not even helping out they were all just staying still while Edward did all the work they were all useless.
I also dont
                  think it is that memorable as other series such as Code Geass or The Monagatari Series.",7
"
                This is shonen done right. Good plot and strong character build focus. Initially i was going to give it a 10, but there are some minor issues which in my opinion lower the score.
1.- The show is twice long as it should have been. Yes this makes space for more characterization but it's not used well.
2.- There is a lot of redundancy and overextended scenes of dialog which makes the pace slow, even boring by the end of the show. Characters repeat themselves quite often and talk about obvious stuff or reference things which the viewer and the other characters know for sure. This isn't
                  necessary, it's not like the show has 400 episodes, and is dull. 
How many times the characters have to say the rule of equivalent exchange per episode? Twice? 
Overall it's a good show and i recommend it to anyone who likes shonens",8
"
                I had two problems while watching. NO.1 should I watch FMA or FMAB. In the end, I realized both are the same. Except for FMA describes the story in detail while FMAB doesn't.
A great introduction to a new world with a simple yet intricate, original magic story mechanics which is rare in any story (Alchemy!) and utilizes it till the bitter end
This anime has the story and quality. Probably my most favorite so far. The characters are cute and their development was awesome. It would've been better if they showed the past clearly in FMAB like FMA. The death is of Hughes's really sad. Winry
                  and Edward's relation was cute. Scar's revenge was meaningful. The humor was really amazing. 
I've seen many people comparing it with Pokemon or Naruto. But really it's fully different. It's not as good as modern-day anime tho.
SPOILER ALERT: Selim is a child, but actually a homunculus. Bradley was specifically created to be King, but he didn’t ask for it and had to go through some terrible things (such as being forced to kill his comrades and not telling his wife the truth about himself) which made me realize that neither he nor most of the other homoculi would care about world domination, but due to them being pawns in a bigger scheme, they really didn’t have much of a choice. They weren’t too overpowered like with other anime villains, and actually had some cool abilities that made each fight feel like it could go one way or another. All in all, this anime was great and I’d recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy animes such as myself. I feel like this anime is the Mozart to ones like Saitama or Pokemon. Sure, it may be old, but it has a certain beauty only people with open minds can understand. So if you can do that, I think you’ll be happy that you ended up watching it.
It's really worth it. I hope you can enjou=y it as well.",9
"
Summary:  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a popular series. It even reached #1 on MAL. While the series is excellent, it's difficult to say if it deserves the top spot on the website. Taste is subjective, after all.
However, I feel that despite the popularity and hype, FMAB does do many things well, and it definitely deserves to be recognized for its strengths. I am also a fan of the 2003 series, but this review will primarily focus on the 2009 series.
Breakdown:
Story: Fullmetal Alchemist is set in a fictional version of Europe. The universe expands in the 2009 Brotherhood adaptation to include other nations that serve
                  as fictional versions of China and Russia.
FMAB is fast-paced and offers many engaging fights and political intrigue.
It isn't labyrinthine or incomprehensible, but it's compelling enough to create an effectively complex narrative.
FMAB might be a bit more of a stereotypical shounen than the 2003 anime, but it still introduces themes and quandaries that are philosophical in nature.  There are also several scenes that provide closure to the 2003 anime (such as Envy and Lust's fates), and the ending is also more closed-ended and satisfying.
Art:
The art quality is high. The fights are well-animated, and the show is bright and colorful. The nations have distinct landscapes and the characters also have distinct and varied designs.
Sound: The soundtrack in the 2003 version was slightly better, but FMAB also has a good soundtrack and an excellent dub.
Characters: FMAB's characters are quite memorable. While some comedic moments with the characters might fall flat, others are quite funny. The characters' motivations are all closely tied to the plot, and few seem to be filler characters. The 2003 FMA did develop some characters and relationships a bit more, but FMAB balances the characters and plot fairly well. The characters are easy to root for, and many of them are given a chance to shine in the 2009 anime, mainly Roy Mustang, King Bradley, and Scar. Ling, Olivier, and the new homunculi are also welcome additions to the cast.
Enjoyment: FMAB is fun. It is complex enough to make you think but simple enough to entertain you with its animation, comedy, and action. I have watched both FMA and FMAB, and I would recommend watching both to fully enjoy the franchise.
Overall: FMAB isn't a perfect anime, but it's watchable, memorable, and entertaining. Some things are resolved a bit quickly and some humor falls a bit flat, but FMAB is an enjoyable adventure anime that ends both series on a high note.
Overall score: 9/10",9
"
                This is my anime series, and my imagination was just captured by him. This series has it all: an exciting plot, interesting characters, humor ...
You are already waiting for the next one to find out the sequel. The end is not so predictable that I personally probably day two, and I could not believe in the possibility of such an end.
I would like to say that all this will be in the series, that ""you can’t get something, something exploded."" In conclusion i want to say that this anime it's a kind of masterpiece to me.  I was really exited to watch it and
                  every episode was extremely interesting . I hope that everyone will like this anime as much as i did",9
"
                A retrospective thoughts on the series and its fanbase.
I will be short on discussing the plot and the character but I have to mention something.
First of all, it is better than the first adaptation.  As much as I like FMA, Brotherhood is times better.  We all know dramatic moments of the series and it is a classic that everyone has to watch/read.
And now my opinion on the fanbase that boils in my mind for year.
I appreciate opinion of the majority, so if Brotherhood is #1 on MAL, is fine for me.  But subjectively, in my opinion there are series that may be,
                  and even are better than this show.
The fanbase of FMAB is so overprotective, so unapologetic, so egotistical, that cannot accept any show to be number 1 apart from 
the one in question.
Subjectively the Final Season of AoT is better than FMAB.  And so many people agreed on it it got its first place.  But as soon as it did, the fans started to downvote Attack on Titan.  It just makes FMAB fans to look bad, sad and pitty.  Shame on them.",8
"
                Watched twice (first time back in ~2012 and 2nd time in 2021).
Episodes 1 - 44 were thoroughly enjoyable. However, I began losing interest in the final ~20 or so episodes to the point I would skip entire sections to speed it up. Watching the protagonists with their battle cries flinging themselves into chaos does lose its edge...eventually.
To put it bluntly, the show went from ""Here's a conspiracy beyond your wildest dreams"" to ""Here's a bunch of (supposedly) entertaining fight scenes."" 
They could cut out on 15-20 of the final episodes (or distribute them to telling the story of Ed/Al more cohesively from previous plot points)
                  and it would easily be a 9/10.
At my age (30), I simply don't have much interest for that kind of melodramatic action. Also, it defies imagination that when fighting some entity so powerful, pretty much no significant protagonist ended up dead. 
This is a 8.2-8.4 out of 10. Great show, but definitely not the best.",8
"
                Story: The overarching storyline is intriguing and well done. However, a few plot points only make sense if you watch the first adaptation like with one of the characters. The script was out of character every once in a while and one entire arc this was just a bunch of boring melodrama that did not make sense and nearly made me drop the entire anime. 8/10
Art: Character designs looked nice and the animation is smooth. It really shined with the action scenes. 10/10
Sound: Voice acting was good. The sound effects were also good. The soundtrack was good but that is it. It did not really
                  help with anything other than filling the silence and was just bland. 9/10
Character: There was development with some of them but they did not really leave much of an impression. I only enjoyed 4 characters which sucks due to what happens to them. Still, though, they get the job done and the 4 characters were still enjoyable. 7/10
Enjoyment: The first time I watched this was after watching the original and on my second watch I enjoyed this adaptation less than the first adaptation. I think the first adaptation just was better and the flaws in both show. However, I still enjoyed this a lot more than other shows. It is just that I have a version of this I prefer so I do not have much reason to watch this. 9/10
Overall: While I mostly pointed out the flaws, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is still A really great show. I just decided to speak of the flaws. The world building and story are really good other than one really bad arc and the fights are well done. It is not perfect but there is an adaptation that I argue is better. 8/10",8
"
                A masterpiece. There are no bad episodes. At most prehaps a slightly good episode. The characters are all very well written from the two amazing protagonist in Edward and elric, to the villians, to some of the other characters like Roy mustang and Alex Armstrong. The story is compelling and keeps you hook. The backstory of the brothers is great. Popped with great openings. Really good animation for  the late 2000s. Alongside a really interesting country and settings. With liore, central, ishval, xing and more! The openings are all bangers with again, hologram, golden time lover, period and rain!. The endings are very hit
                  or miss but my personal favourites are ending 1 and 4. And the final arc will just keep you hooked",10

                Que dire...
Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood est un de ces animes qui ne vous laissera pas indifférent, tant certains thèmes évoqués sont percutants, tant les musiques accompagnant l'intrigue sont d'une justesse et d'une puissance sans égale, tant l'histoire vous fera vibrer au fil des nombreux rebondissements, tant chaque personnage est développé dans son entièreté. 
Rien n'est laissé au hasard, chaque personnage se voit un développement parfois court mais convainquant. Chaque personnage a son importance, son passé, son future.
Mais si je devais vraiment résumer mon avis sur cet anime, je devrais parler de son impact sur ma personne, comment je l'ai ressenti, comment je l'ai perçu. Et
                  dieu sait que je l'ai prit en pleine tronche, tant la tristesse de certains passages, s'est abattue sur moi telle la foudre d'un orage divin. Cet anime suinte le désespoir, et ce, dès les premiers épisodes. Certains moments m'ont vraiment mis dans un mal intense tant le désespoir était présent dans l'intrigue et tant ce désespoir était crédible et authentique. Je me rappelle avoir pleurer, ris, éprouver de l'attachement, de la peur, de l'interrogation. Je me rappelle avoir été secouer de tout mon être devant cet anime qui m'a laisser une marque au plus profond de mon coeur, au plus profond de ma sensibilité.
Il y a tant de chose a débattre, a critiquer, mais je préfère laisser parler mon coeur tant cet anime peut aborder des thèmes que je ne me soupçonnais pas prendre autant personnellement.
La quête de reconnaissance, l'importance de l'amitié, les traumatismes, la guerre, nos péchés, nos désirs toujours plus grands, la vengeance, les différences, le deuil, la recherche d'identité profonde... tant de sujets viennent frapper le spectateur en pleine poitrine, dans un cocktail d'action, d'émotion, d'amour, de combat, d'intrigue, de mystère, mais surtout d'alchimie. Une recette alchimique qui chez moi a fait mouche, et qui me permet aujourd'hui de placer Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood dans mon panthéon des animes favoris, et ce, pour toujours.
Ce sera un anime qui laissera un vide après son visionnage, un trou béant dans votre coeur, mais qui vous rappellera sans cesse l'importance de vivre sa vie a son plein potentiel, d'être sois même, de réaliser ses buts, de ne pas s'attarder sur la méchanceté, sur l'avarice, sur la gourmandise... de profiter pleinement de la vie et de ses plaisirs, des personnes qui nous sont chers, tout comme de rendre hommage a ceux qui sont partis. Cet anime est presque un mode d'emploi de la vie, tant il nous apprends des choses par le regard D'Edward et d'Alphonse, ces deux jeunes frères au destin si tragique.",10

                (I try to keep my reviews short and sweet and straight to the point without giving away spoilers with that said lets get this show on the road)
this anime is so confusing because i watch fullmetal alchemist and i thought that fullmetal alchemist brotherhood was just a continuation of the first series its not like that at all they made fullmetal alchemist and i guess they didn't like it or what ever so they decided to make a new and improve one     
this anime have
bits and piece of romance (nothing huge)
the plot/story is kinda good
the art is okay 
is really funny
sometimes
                  sad
i recommend that you watch this anime because its just general anime that everyone would like but this is just of my point of view you should watch it and choose if its good or not but the enjoyment is great",9

                SPOILERS FOR FMAB BELOW
fmab is really something else
after finishing it not too long ago, this fucking show is still on my mind and i swear everything about it is near-perfect, so i decided to write a review about what i think
STORY: 10
this is the first story i have seen that is THIS consistently satisfying in an anime. there isnt a single arc past the first 13 fast-paced episodes that i would rate below a 9/10.  yes the story of fmab is super consistent, and thats something i see a lot, but i think the peaks make themselves very clear with that final arc, watching
                  that unfold is really what made me 100% sure that this show was a 10/10 and deserved its #1 rating. it has literally everything you want in a plot, and no other show has made me almost cry like a bitch more than once, but fmab managed to do it in episodes 54 62 AND 63??? the pacing in the first arc is a problem yes, but it isnt enough of a big deal to me to make the story not 10/10, because even then the first arc is extremely enjoyable past episode 1. another flaw is that fmab makes it way harder to hook people into the show than it needs to be; episode 1 just throws you into ed and al doing their job as state alchemists and it really just feels super empty without context and its the main reason why i didnt watch past the first 2 episodes for a week. luckily i dont drop shows and that was probably the best decision i ever made because oh my god every other part of the story is so amazing and enjoyable
ART: 9
when i first picked up the show, i did NOT like the art at all. mainly the art style of characters, i thought their faces looked too round, and it looked stupid, but oh my god every other point of the show being a 10 brings this up because while i still dont find it as great as some of the other shows ive watched, the art and animation is very enjoyable. almost every big fight has 10/10 animation, and there are very few characters who look they actually have awkward design like i first thought (i thought mustang and riza looked weird) but seriously, i dont think i couldve asked for animation thats a lot better than this, because fmab animation really is special, although its not perfect to me. also wanted to talk about how perfect the op/ed animation is, ESPECIALLY op 4 op 5 ed 1 and ed 4, literally just perfection, never seen ops and eds animated better. ALSO the animation on humorous moments is a flaw for a lot of people but i fucking loved it sm it just made the scenes that much better
SOUND: 10
oh my god the sound is so amazing, the voice actors in sub are 10/10 (didnt watch dub), the ops are for the most part are amazing, the eds are EVEN BETTER TO ME??? the ost is astounding, like what do i even say. some of my favourites have to be op 5, op 2, ed 1, ed 4, ed 5, crime and punishment, sorrowful stone, and the main theme. some of my favourite voice actors.. like what do i even say everyone was so amazing. i was a huge fan of scar and bradley though, their voices just made that fight in episode 61 even better.  the biggest thing i could say is alphonses voice is very awkward on his post-timeskip self when he has his body back, but its really just a nitpick because i have 0 problems at all with his voice without his body, i feel like it makes sense that his voice hasnt developed when its just in his gate of truth. 
CHARACTER: 10 (11 if i could)
my favourite part about fmab has to be the fucking amazing, huge, and diverse cast. almost every character serves a purpose, and it just makes the final fight with like basically everyone that much more satisfying. the cast has everything, it has characters you are guaranteed to love, characters you are guaranteed to hate (fuck the golden tooth doctor,) the coldest mfs alive, the most wholesome mfs alive, the funniest mfs alive,  A DOG WHO LITERALLY SAVES ONE OF THE BEST CHARACTERS LIVES??? like seriously what more can you ask for, fmab has my favourite cast out of any anime ever and its not very close either. apart from the 3 most popular that are ed mustang and al, some of my favourites would have to be envy, bradley, and hohenheim. yes i am a massive envy fan fight me episode 54 was probably my favourite in the whole series for that reason
there are virtually no flaws with fmabs cast, and the biggest one i could think of is father felt underdeveloped when he like.. u know... swallowed god but i feel like the scene when he was in his dwarf in a flask form speaking with truth.. that scene made him a much better character for me, but i still feel like there couldve been an even better final villain even if im very happy with this one, i just like a few of the villains more
ENJOYMENT: 10
like i dont think i need to say much here, its fullmetal alchemist brotherhood LMFAO, its #1 on mal for a reason and its kinda extremely difficult to not enjoy it unless youre one of the people who hate popular stuff because its popular
OVERALL: 10/10 SOOO close to perfect but thats good enough for me",10

                Definitely created an account just to review this beautiful epicness of a show. I am someone who 99% of the time would prefer the original text, but FMAB adaptation is the 1% that elevated its origin to a god-tier level experience.
Out with the big gun; I love how the show reshuffled the storyline and added character moments in this anime. Yes, there are scenes I do want them to include, but the adaptation also focused more on building up the tension to a nerve-wracking mode and slowly revealed at the moment of relief. 
*Spoiler*
- I especially enjoyed Hohenheim's role in here more, despite seeing less
                  than the manga because he truly embodies the mystery and the theme. Yet he still brought me to tears in the recap episode! That was just crazy good writing.
- Kimbley's investigation of Scar was also thrilling to watch, he became my favorite villain in this show at that instant because I love my bad guy cunning, terrifying, and morally tempting. 
- The Ishval War stories spanning out through the series to gut-punch you at the right moment.
- Colonel Mustang kill or no-kill suspense. I trust him til the end, but that slow reveal was riveting.
The soundtracks are just plain haunting. Not even including those bangers of opening and end credits.
The voice actors are all superb, both Japanese AND English dub, how is this possible?!? I still mostly prefer watching in Japanese, but I did enjoy Mustang's deep voice in English because...hot🔥. LOL
Even the color adds another texture to the stories. The beauty and the dreadful moments. Like Scar's tragic backstory scene just proof to me the power of coloring. That one truly puts me in his state of mind.
The action scenes *oh my*! Where do I even begin. There are just too many memorable, brutal scenes I loved here.
- Lust Vs. Mustang is still the one of top anime moments ever.
- Bradley the Slicer Vs. the army. 
- Hohenheim's true plan, while not entirely action-packed, was definitely the best twist ever.
I admit to completing the series before reading the manga, but this is not at all to disrespect Sensei Hiromu's impact on the stories because it IS her world, characters, and deep philosophical idea on morality that intrigued me so. I just want to praise everyone behind the adaptation as well, especially the anime directors and team who did not sleepwalk through the process. They make the themes in the manga fully realized and heartwrenching beautiful. I'm so thankful. This show basically resurrects my love for anime.",10
"
                I believe that this version of Fullmetal Alchemist delivers the story in greater detail right from the beginning all the way to the end. I've seen enough episode to know an awesome animation when I see it. One thing I like is that the voice actors retain their characters personalities and feelings without going a little overboard. The art was impressive, though both beginning and ending themes are too high pitch, but still decent. I hear that some people come with mixed feelings about the new characters , like I said though they're part of bigger relationships and tensions.My opinion about the art used is
                  quite admirable watch the anime you'll see what I mean instead of me telling you. Overall, this deserves a 9/10 for its trouble and hard work.",10
"
                I really enjoyed watching this show from start to end, it felt amazing watching the end credits roll after 64 episodes it felt like I had watched an entire life story of not just Ed and Al, but so many other characters shown throughout the show. It does a really good job of not forgetting side characters and bringing them back at good times because they all played a part in the story shown. 
I started watching it after getting a bit worn out by some other shows I was watching at the time and I have spent the last few days watching the entire
                  show and I dont think I have done this for any other show yet so it felt really good to watch the show in what felt like one sitting. Whenever I had to take a day off from watching and went back the next day it really felt like I never stopped, and knew exactly what was going on, the flow of the story just felt great.
I never watched the 2003 version but from what I have heard this version does a much better job at sticking to the source and im sure thats true. 
I highly recommend this anime to anyone whos looking for a great watch, may be hard to find something to top this.",10

                A review done a few years after wachting and re watching this show 
Story 
Full metal is the history of two brothers that expands over entire country worth of travel and years of their lives, what i like the most is the use of relatable themes in a fantasy setting; they explore a broad range of topics like how to deal with lost, the impact of religion or science on people, the abuse of goverment power, and even existential awareness and the concept of god, and it manage to wave this thing form start to finish with cohesion most of the times.
Art and animation 
I
                  miss 64 episode animes, it was another time, the art its faithful to the character design, the enviromenta are also very well acomplish, the only thing bugs me its the comparison, the original anime had a more wash classic 2000 anime look and it was great undo there were some shorts in the animation department, this is the opposite fluid animation but its look its more digital but still great.  
Sound, music and op 
There all great, the ops and endings set the tone of the story and are overall great, the ost its also a highlight because its iconic and complements the funny, dramatic and action moments. 
Characters 
In this regard FMA stand very tall, edward and alfons are great alone and working of each other as older and younger brother respectively, their supporting cast is charming unique and well develop noteworthy examples are amstrong and mustang, the antagonist are complex and likable/ despicable when they have to, i really like envys arc, and solf j kim is a bastard, they all get the chance to be explain and stand a remainder of want people become when dont deal with their circumstances or emotions. 
Downsides 
Unfortunately not every thing is perfect, even with a high praise as this series gets, some  plot points are  rush in the beginning ( nina) and some are straight up omited, meaning  that is almost necessary to wacht the 2003 version. The ending is a something that requires a spoiler conversation, but i dare to say that it is emotinaliy good but in terms of the action not so much 
Overall 
This is a most watch for anime fans and people how like great stories in general, an definitive recommendation for my part",9
"
                Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is considered by many to be the greatest Anime of all time. This is for very good reason.
The storyline is its strongest point. It is full of twists and turns that are interesting and do not feel like completely asspulls. 10/10
The art is great mostly. There are parts of the show I am not too fond of. And there are some CGI uses that I personally disagree with. As with most animation though it comes down to preference. 9/10
The Characters are almost all amazing. There are a few characters who are introduced later on in the series who I genuinely feel
                  take away from both the main storyline and the enjoyment of the series. with the exception of this every other character is well executed and satisfying to learn about, watch, and see in action. 9/10
The series is beyond enjoyable. If you are not interested in action, you might be interested in the mystery, if you are not interested in the mystery perhaps you are interested in the somberness or the comedy. This show truly has a little bit of everything in it for everyone and does not feel forced or inorganic at all. 10/10
FMA: Brotherhood is not a perfect show, no story is and that is okay. But it has held up even all of these years later. Worth the watch.",10
"
                FAVORITE.  As I said with the first series, how can you not sympathize with two boys missing their mother?
Although the beginning feels a little rushed, it does make sense not to dwell too much on the events we already saw in the first version.  Subtle differences make the recap worth it.
With strong characters like Winry, Hawkeye, Lan Fan, and Major General Armstrong, you can really tell that this series is written by a woman.  Winry is far more independent, and actually involved in the plot instead of just tagging along.  None of them are your typical damsel in distress, or even
                  magical girl.  They also prove that normal folks can be even more badass than alchemists.
As noted by Vic and Caitlin, if the first series had its dark moments, Brotherhood was kind of like ""so how dark can we get?""  I do not recommend eating while watching the final battle.
I am a shameless Ed/Winry shipper, and while the manga still delivers more, Brotherhood gives me some great moments.  I have a bone or two to pick with some English translations (""She's a good honest girl.  Take good care of her"" =/= ""That's a nice honest friend you've got there.  Make sure you both take good care of her""), but episodes 22, ""Backs in the Distance"" pulls some lines and animation straight from the manga, and I'm more than satisfied with that.",10
"
                NOTE: English is not my first language and I don't usually write a reviews but I will try my best.
Oh dear, where do I start. 
I didn't actually think I would enjoy the concept of alchemy, because I hated that subject back in school, but oh man I was wrong.
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood really is something special. I enjoyed every single episode through out the show. I have spent 4 sleepless nights watching this masterpiece and it didn't disappoint in any second.
Story 10/10
I am not going to repeat the whole story into this review but I am going to tell you that this is incredibly well
                  written, you really start to get immersed into it after only couple of episodes. I love how many different areas and cities were covered into this somewhat short anime and that is something I always loved about this one. It is incredible how well is the whole country of Amestris designed for only one purpose. I like how cities and government are inspired by Germany and Britain in that time, also names of the cities kind of remind me of how communists used to give names to the city parts like eastern block, western block etc. Also I love the diversity of people and I like how they showed us the strugle of certain people group or race which is really relatable to real life, in fact many things in FMA are relatable but this one really stood out to me. Although I would love to know more about the cuntries around them and how different is their life style compared to Amestris, I get that it would probably be too much. At least they showed us the desert and the story of the ancient city and how it all started.
Art 10/10
At first I thought that I will not like this art style but I ended up loving it. I am not going to talk too much about it, but it is pretty appealing to the eyes. As I said in story section, I love how they showed us different areas of the country and even outside a little, it just looks stunningly amazing. 
Sound 10/10
I am one of those people who prefer watching dub over sub, because I can actually focus on beauty of the actual art and animation. I am not much of a reader so you will probably understand why. Anyways the dub is actually pretty well done. I watched many different dubs of other anime and I can say that this one is probably one of the best out there. English voice actors really did hell of a job to express the emotions of different characters. Sound effects were pretty good also, they sounded pretty realistic at times.
Characters 10/10
I coundn't resist not to fall in love with the characters. Oh man, they are probably the main reason why this show is so popular and this successful. I love the fact how quickly the characters can get emotional and how much their emotions can affect the story. I can't describle my feelings well but I felt all kinds of emotions in different moments, I got emotionally conceted to many characters like Ed, Al, Winry, Mustang, Amstrong, Greed... I love when writers put a little romance and just spice things a bit more. They kind of trolled us at end there when Ed proposed to Winry, i expected a kiss or just a simple ""I love you"" but nope... Anyway I am just happy that he did propose to her, I was shipping them all along and in the end it all worked out he indeed got taller :).
Enjoyment 10/10
Well what to say here, I was getting so exited episode after episode that I spent many sleepless nights watching 14 episodes a day. I can clearly say that I don't regret anything. All this time and sleepless nights are worth it and I enjoyed every second of it.
Overall 10/10
To be honest I couldn't really find big flaw that is worth mentioning at all, there are just all these beautiful moments that really push those small negatives that this show has. That's why I won't even bother mentioning any of them.
There are many things I wanted to say but this language barrier is screwing me over. I tired my best to explain how I felt watching this masterpiece. I know there is a lot of Love/Like stuff but you will have to deal with it if you ever end up reading my review.
So if you haven't watched Fullmetal Alchemist yet you better do it, you won't regret it. :)",10

                Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood is one of quite few animes that have both enormous fidelity in the art TOGHETER with a great story. This comes partly from the fact that the anime was made by a great array of experienced animators, and partly from the story being carbon copied from the manga (Not a bad thing!)
-- Story: 9 --
Brotherhood is meant to be a remake of the Original FMA to fix up its mistakes and follow the manga, which means the story isnt all action based, which is a good change of direction.
The story is quite fast paced, but that isnt a bad thing, as it
                  doesnt lose track of anything or fail to explain anything, which in turn makes the pacing in the end, perfect for the series.
However, I could not come to enjoy the story fully (hence, the 9), due to some slight clichés that were in it, but it was still great.
-- Art: 10 --
The art direction.
Oh. My. God.
The art is simply top class. I have no complaints about it.
A short, quick and simple 10/10.
-- Sound: 10 --
The soundtrack was outstanding, and it did a GREAT job at placing the themes exactly where they should be, as well as using a wide array of different styles in the music.
I will keep all openings in my favourites, thats for sure.
-- Character: 9 --
The character development was handled very nice and most if not all characters had great depth to them (excluding background characters, for obvious reasons). Not many characters was simply left without a background
Also the thing Edward does in the final scene, just sealing up his character development in a nice bag and taking it home with him. Perfect.
-- Enjoyment: 9 --
I REALLY enjoyed it.
-- Overall: 9 --",9
"
                NOTE: I may be comparing Brotherhood with the 2003 version of FMA a few times in this review.
*I'll attempt to keep spoilers down to a minimum.*
   Brotherhood is a re-adaption of the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist, except this time it stays as close as possible to the source material (The manga).  I have roughly seen both the Manga & the original and this anime is better than the original & manga in many ways, but can fail to be better in certain areas, the problems are extremely minor so It's not all of a bothersome to me.
STORY: 9
   If your unfamiliar
                  with the plot MAL does a nice job summing it up already, but I'll make a short summary. 
   There's two brothers named Edward & Alphonse Elric, they live in a fantasy like setting and alchemy is used for military or whatever else customs. Ed and Al's mother passed away, they try to bring her back using Alchemy, it obviously fails because Human Transmutation is a taboo amongst alchemists, Ed loses his left leg, Al loses his body, Ed bonds Al's soul to armor & Ed loses his right arm in exchange. Most of the anime revolves around them trying to fix what they've lost, and trying to seek the legendary Philosopher's stone or any other resource to restore their bodies back to normal.
   Now, unlike 2003 the first 15 or so episodes feel a bit rushed, you don't get to spend much time with Nina or the Hughes Family, there's also a lot of cut out things like for instance the Youswell's Coal Mine incident, where it just becomes a flashback in the story of Lieutenant Yoki. However, a lot of people think the creators believed most viewers have already seen the original FMA before viewing FMAB, so it was rushed so viewers could get to the new material faster. There's only this minor pasting problem. After around episode 15 this anime is fantastic & almost flawless.
   In Brotherhood there's more to Amestris, Brotherhood opens up to world where more things do exist, such as Xing, Xerxes or Ishval.
Also, I'd like to mention..
   The tone of Brotherhood feels more Adventurous & more Shounen like which sets a different tone from 2003 which is more philosophical & leans more to the darker scale. I personally loved both series for the different feel of the story.
   Brotherhood is also a good start out anime, it's got a variety of different genre's and it pulls it off extremely well, the balance between seriousness and comedy is a little iffy for the first couple of episodes, but it starts to balance out well as the anime progresses.
ART: 10
   This is probably one of Studio Bone's best work; the animation is seriously flawless for this one. The action scenes look great, the openings are well animated. The Atmosphere feels right with the story, never had it felt out of place, the backdrops are visually nice, the character designs are unique and look cool, they fit their characters, there's no problems with getting a character mixed up, you can tell who's who easily. The art style wasn't bothersome at all. The simple effects like Alchemy & fire are also done really well in this anime. So yeah, there's nothing really to add, the art's fantastic.
SOUND: 10
   The soundtrack is much more ""Epic"" in terms of tone compared to 2003 being more somber. I personally like the more emotional tracks more, and that makes me like the 2003's OST a little more than Brotherhoods; but I understand that it wouldn't fit with the whole atmosphere, as Brotherhood is more adventurous & fantasy like in nature. Don't get me wrong, the OST is still amazing, I'm sad ""Brothers"" isn't in there because y'know that song literally has a huge label that says Fullmetal Alchemist on it, but it probably wouldn't really fit with the style of Brotherhood. Some of my favorite pieces from Brotherhood's OST are ""A soldiers honor"", ""Trisha's Lullaby"" or ""Crime & Punishment"". All openings in my opinion were great, I don't think I disliked any of them. Also, ""Again"" by Yui is amazing. The endings are all great as well. The sound effects are done well & the voice acting for Dub & Sub are phenomenal. I normally don't like English dubs, but this ones amazing.
CHARACTER: 10
   Never have I liked ALL the characters in a anime before, the characters are extremely likable even if they were 'bad' or were 'villains' & their motives or goals were interesting to see. All characters had a purpose to be there even if they were just thrown there for a episode or two and never to be seen again. There's a vast amount of characters, but I'm going to focus on the two main characters- Edward & Alphonse Elric. Ed is probably one of my all time favorite anime characters. There's something about him that seems unique. He's a prodigy, he's moody & hotheaded and has a short temper (mostly when he's called short) but that's mostly for comedy purposes. Behind acting like a ass sometimes he's extremely caring for his brother, he'd do anything to protect him & would give up everything just to save him or get him back to his original body. Edward also isn't destined to win everything, he does lose and there's consequences to his mistakes. He's not a cardboard cutout like most shounen protagonists. Then there's Alphonse- He's Naive, innocent and could be easily manipulated. He really cares for his brother though, even more than himself & would do anything to protect him or get his arm and leg back to normal. I also enjoyed character development in this anime, as the anime progresses you get to see the Elric brothers mature a bit, same as the supporting cast, you get some insight on the villains motives as well.
ENJOYMENT- 10
   This anime was enjoyable, actually one of the only anime's I've watched where I was gripped by the plot at any given moment. It was hard to stop watching this anime & I easily became hooked after the 3rd or 4th episode or so.
OVERALL- 10
   WATCH IT NOW. If you haven't seen any Fullmetal Alchemist I'm jealous. It's a must watch, this & 2003 should be viewed by any anime fan even if it's just to say you watched it.",10
"
                I'm going to be very honest..... I'm not seeing this #1 anime of all time factor. I enjoyed it enough to finish the show (and if you've seen my first review you'll know I lack the patience to finish an anime regardless of length that has totally taken the fun out of watching such anime) however, I found that at times it was somewhat dull and even some of the fights were kind of boring to watch. I suppose I should just list my ratings.
Story: 8/10
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is about 2 young boys, Edward and Alphonse Elric, becoming State Alchemists so that they can eventually
                  find the key to recovering their bodies/ body parts that they lost when they attempted to transmute their dead mother many years ago. Overall, the premise is nice and it leaves the audience hoping for the characters' success in their endeavors. The story of the Elric Brothers' journey is beautiful and while I'll try not to spoil the end, the theme: the Law of Equivalent Exchange is certainly well illustrated. 
Art: 5/10
I don't care as much about animation when I think of the reasons why I like an anime, but to be honest the art/animation is extremely mediocre. The colours are dull, the design of the world and characters is very bland, and these things kind of make the overall feel a little dry. It's not supposed to be a goofy or upbeat anime like other shonen we all know, but it could have used some vibrancy.
Sound: 6/10
Not much to say about this category. The music was okay but nothing to write home about.
Character: 6/10
Yeah.... this is one of those categories that really makes or breaks an anime for me and unfortunately I can't say anything was great about any of these characters. They all felt one dimensional and most weren't very interesting at all. Not even the main characters were interesting. I guess I preferred some characters (Envy, May, Izumi, Scar) but others were just one note, even the one's with the most tragic backstories.
Enjoyment: 7/10
I was able to enjoy this anime. However, there aren't any other takeaways from this anime. Not many memorable moments come to mind for me and I just finished this show last week. Sure there were some cool fights and the concept of the relationship between God and Alchemy was interesting, but I think that this show deserves a solid 6 in the Enjoyment department because unlike how I feel deeply in love with other anime, I did not feel the same way about FMAB. For me it was missing that WOW factor and that might have partially been because I was expecting it to be so good.
Overall: 7/10
I would recommend this anime, but don't fall for the hype. Just enjoy it for what it is and if you find that you don't, I guess you can just drop it.",7

                - English Review (Translated version)
At this point I am not going to be the one to discover anything to anyone about ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"". Years ago I read the original manga version of Arakawa's work. In fact, I have it complete in physical format and I keep it as gold in cloth. By this I mean that I no longer had the surprise factor of the script, characters and other elements at the time I started to see this adaptation, but even so I must say that I was amazed as if it had been the first time that I was immersed in the adventures
                  of Ed and Al. Partly because ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" is already a wonder in itself, partly because I can't think of a better way to bring to anime the great work of the, also great, Hiromu Arakawa.
One of the strong points (if any) of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" is, without any doubt, its plot. From the very beginning it is intuited that the story will be colossal, epic, of those that marks... and hell if it is. Throughout the 64 episodes of the anime, Arakawa gradually spins each character's background, each new situation, each detail and each nook and cranny. In this way he manages to weave a completely solid net, entertaining, impactful at times and that makes you stuck to the screen from the first minute to the last. Along the way he is able to perfectly combine really hard moments with other very emotional ones, without forgetting that funny white humor, which is also one of its great signs of identity. To name something negative (but I insist that it is basically to make a little counterweight to the amount of positive aspects it has), perhaps the main plot, especially towards the end, has moments in which a little entangled entering into metaphysical and philosophical aspects, which generates a little confusion at some point. Nothing important, of course.
From ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" I am very clear that its greatest value are its characters. In fact, I can state categorically that its character squad is the best I have ever seen in an anime. Just like that. For variety, charisma and ability to create empathy. It has a lot of merit that in a story with such a large number of characters, all of them border on such a high level. It's just spectacular. There are other animes with very good characters (I think ""Steins;Gate"" or ""Shokugeki no Soma""), but they have a smaller quantity of them or they don't have such a high quality in the overall, but in specific characters. I think Arakawa's ability to create so many different and charismatic characters can only be compared to Eiichiro Oda's genius in that sense. Big words, yes, but totally deserved. To name a few, without forgetting the brilliant protagonists Edward and Alphonse Elric, there would be room for characters such as Winry, Roy Mustang (and his inseparable Hawkeye), Scar, May Chang, the Armstrong brothers (especially Olivier), Ling and Lan Fan, Hohenheim... All with their role, with their importance, with their background, and even with their own sub-plots. And the villains, of course: Lust, Envy, Greed... In short, a list that would be endless if I had to name all the great characters of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"".
Finally, I'd like to talk about the technical sections. So in short, I think that the visual section meets without emphasizing too much and on the contrary the musical section is outstanding. I will explain something more in detail. When I talk about the visual section I am not referring to the artistic style. Not at all. Arakawa's style, so characteristic, I like. It's relaxed yet detailed. She is also able to create a relative variety within the, also relative, visual realism of his works. But I think that technically this adaptation could have done a better job. Nothing serious, eh. Sometimes the drawing is not as good as it should be, especially in certain character animations or in the excessive blurring/simplification of scenarios. I'm not saying it's bad, but I'm saying that maybe sometimes it's not up to all the other great sections of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"". As is the musical section, which is a real marvel. Probably one of the best global OST of the anime, with some pieces that are directly masterpieces. There are so many that are worthwhile, but I personally get ""Lullaby of Resembool"" if I have to name just one of them. As for openings/endings, I won't tire of repeating that I prefer a small number of them, as this creates a strong relationship between melody and anime that helps to create a greater self-identity in our mind. In ""FMA: Brotherhood"" there are too many. Five openings and five different endings in 64 episodes. Excessive. It's a detail I can forgive such a good series, but it's reality and I want to comment it. At least most of them are quite good. If I have to choose, I keep OP1 and ED3.
- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)
A estas alturas no voy a ser yo quien descubra nada a nadie sobre ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"". Hace años que leí la versión original en manga de la obra de Arakawa. De hecho, la tengo completa en formato físico y la guardo como oro en paño. Con esto quiero decir que ya no contaba con el factor sorpresa del guion, personajes y demás elementos en el momento que me puse a ver esta adaptación, pero aun así debo decir que me ha maravillado como si hubiera sido la primera vez que me sumergía en las aventuras de Ed y Al. En parte porque ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" ya es una maravilla de por sí, en parte porque no se me ocurre una mejor forma de llevar al anime la grandísima obra de la, también grandísima, Hiromu Arakawa.
Uno de los puntos fuertes (si es que tiene alguno flojo) de ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" es, sin ningún tipo de duda, su trama. Desde el principio ya se intuye que la historia será colosal, épica, de las que marcan... y vaya si es así. A lo largo de los 64 capítulos que dura el anime, Arakawa va hilando poco a poco cada trasfondo de personaje, cada nueva situación, cada detalle y cada recoveco. De esta forma logra tejer una red completamente sólida, entretenida, impactante por momentos y que te hace estar pegado a la pantalla desde el primer minuto hasta el último. Por el camino es capaz de conjugar perfectamente momentos verdaderamente duros con otros muy emotivos, sin olvidar ese humor blanco tan divertido, que es también una de sus grandes señas de identidad. Por nombrar algo negativo (pero insisto en que es básicamente por hacer un poco de contrapeso a la cantidad de aspectos positivos que tiene), quizá la trama principal, especialmente hacia el final, tiene momentos en las que se enmaraña un poco entrando en aspectos metafísicos y filosóficos, lo que genera un poco de confusión en algún momento puntual. Nada importante, eso sí.
De ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" tengo muy claro que su mayor valor son sus personajes. De hecho, puedo afirmar con rotundidad que su plantilla de personajes es la mejor que he visto nunca en un anime. Tal cual. Por variedad, carisma y capacidad de crear empatía. Tiene muchísimo mérito que en una historia con una cantidad tan grande de personajes, todos rayen a un nivel tan alto. Es algo simplemente espectacular. Hay otros animes con muy buenos personajes (se me vienen a la mente ""Steins;Gate"" o ""Shokugeki no Soma""), pero tienen una cantidad menor de ellos o no tienen una calidad tan alta en el global, sino en personajes concretos. Creo que la capacidad de Arakawa para crear tantísimos personajes carismáticos y diferentes entre sí solo se puede comparar con la genialidad de Eiichiro Oda en ese sentido. Palabras mayores, sí, pero totalmente merecidas. Por nombrar a algunos, sin olvidar a los geniales protagonistas Edward y Alphonse Elric, tendrían cabida personajazos como Winry, Roy Mustang (y su inseparable Hawkeye), Scar, May Chang, los hermanos Armstrong (en especial Olivier), Ling y Lan Fan, Hohenheim... Todos con su papel, con su importancia, con su trasfondo, e incluso con sus subtramas propias. Y los villanos, por supuesto: Lust, Envy, Greed... En fin, una lista que sería interminable si tuviera que nombrar a todos los grandes personajes de ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"".
Para terminar quiero hablar de los apartados técnicos. Aquí veo claroscuros. Así de forma resumida, creo que el apartado visual cumple sin destacar demasiado y por el contrario el apartado musical es de sobresaliente. Paso a explicarme algo más en detalle. Cuando hablo del apartado visual no me estoy refiriendo al estilo artístico. Para nada. El estilo de Arakawa, tan característico, me gusta. Es desenfadado a la vez que detallado. También es capaz de crear una relativa variedad dentro del, también relativo, realismo visual de sus obras. Pero considero que técnicamente en esta adaptación se podría haber hecho un mejor trabajo. Nada grave, eh. A veces el dibujado no es todo lo bueno que debería, especialmente en ciertas animaciones de personajes o en el difuminado/simplificación excesivo de escenarios. No estoy diciendo que sea malo, pero sí que quizá en ocasiones no está a la altura de todos los demás magníficos apartados de ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"". Como sí lo está el apartado musical, que es una auténtica maravilla. Probablemente una de las mejores OST globales del anime, con algunas piezas que directamente son obras maestras. Hay muchísimas que merecen la pena, pero yo personalmente me quedo con ""Lullaby of Resembool"" si tengo que nombrar solo una de ellas. En cuanto a los openings/endings, no me cansaré de repetir que prefiero poca cantidad de ellos, ya que así se crea una relación fuerte entre melodía y anime que ayuda a crear una identidad propia mayor en nuestra mente. En ""FMA: Brotherhood"" hay demasiados. Cinco openings y cinco endings diferentes en 64 capítulos. Excesivo. Es un detalle que puedo perdonarle a una serie tan buena, pero es la realidad y quiero comentarla. Al menos en su mayoría son bastante buenos. Si tengo que elegir, me quedo con el OP1 y con el ED3.",9

                Having watched this as a non-gateway anime in 2021, I can still say that this is quite a good show. The vast amount of interesting story progression, surprises, and action scenes per episode makes for a well-rounded and consistently entertaining experience. I wouldn't call it perfect, though. The comedy, soundtrack, and dialogue suffer from a lot of repetition, and I think there were about 10 too many characters that were given importance for how shallow many of them are. Also, I can't help but feel that some of the most important fights weren't all that satisfying because of how simply they end. Lastly, since there
                  are so many story arcs, it's to be expected that a few of them were kinda average. A lot of the episodes that take place during the third opening come to mind. Despite all that, FMAB does deserve to be called a classic, and I think that, more than most other anime, there's little reason anyone should dislike it. [FINAL SCORE: 8.5/10]",9

                - Slow start (that eventually made sense) but fabulous pacing afterwards.
- CONSISTENT ANIMATION.
- GREAT CHARACTERS who were all handled well & had key roles to play.
- BRILLIANT PLOT that showcased imperialism, racism, feminism & what not. Plot definitely was its strongest point.
- GOD-TIER ENDING. Satisfaction is guaranteed.
- ATYPICAL FIGHT SHONEN. Never felt like ""I'll save the world, yeah!!!"" stuff as the characters had much larger reasons.
- FANTASTIC PLOT TWISTS. Especially the one with Selim & Philosopher's Stone.
- FABULOUS WORLD-BUILDING. I loved Amestris!
- Lots of Sakuga fest. Studio Bones nailed it.
- Great art. Takes time to get used to eyes though.
- Great music. Although, the OP's
                  or ED's weren't consistently great.
- Winry is cute AF.
- Ed & Al are a lovely duo! The dynamic they provided to the series is unimaginable!
- Sound designing problems (effects felt too loud).
- EASILY TOP 5. 10/10. 🐐",10

                Surely my favourite anime. It starts like an non-pretender show... and then, the emotional charge hits you, and not kindly at all. It has a couple of epic fights, i can give it that. The story and the background story it´s not a sure masterpiece but, if you sit down to apreciate might worth to spend some. I liked how it ended, and the motivation for Edward to keep going on to save his brother and mother it´s pretty beautiful though. A great piece indeed. Anyway, a good anime for those who´s not aquainted to 'the otaku world' lol. Kinda easy to watch( saying this
                  ´cause i didnt rewatched tho.)",10
"
                Two brothers and one single purpose, return to their original bodies or parts.
Edward Elric: A character with enough charisma and a pretty good development, just works perfectly.
Alphonse Elric: It makes very good complemnto for his brother, is a bit more sensitive and as the story is advanced, we are getting a good development of characters. I'm going to stop talking about the characters here because, I do not want to engage in spoilers.
Technical section: It is a solid animation where the scenarios where they evolve, the battles are very well achieved and the animation of each of its characters meets luxury. That ""Steampunk"" style is
                  handled very well.
Maybe my only problem is the development of a couple of characters, I feel that they deserved much more prominence.",8
"
                Just a Masterpiece! 
This anime is like a Roller-coaster ride. Full of drifting actions, bleeding edge emotions, a very powerful plot and with so many great (Pss...I mean best) Characters. The journey starts with two brothers but after you've gone deep, you'll face so many lives and their stories! Just a full mind blower! I think each person who knows the name 'Anime' should no, MUST WATCH IT!!!!
It’s literally a masterpiece shounen anime and that is why considered as #1 ranked show and is constantly referred to as greatest show ever created.
FMAB- Plot (No Spoilers)
The FMAB plot and character are its strongest aspects. The world
                  that it creates. Never once does the story contradict its own rules, and even smallest of details becomes very important and literally everything gets clearly jelled in the story with passing of the show. It unveils itself at just the right pace to keep you interested whilst still keeping other things for very end. It’s one of the marks of strong storytelling and it is definitely a benchmark for any writer out there.
The series follows the story of two alchemist brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who wants to restore their bodies after a disastrous failed attempt to bring their mother back to life through alchemy. They do the sin of human transmutation and lost their bodies and that’s how story unfolds. In beginning, One of the best scene comes when scientist transmuting his own daughter into a dog. The show has very few flaws, like telling audience so many times about how ed and al lost their body and sometimes lame comedy in serious moments. But, with every episode it becomes Mind blowing. Every character is amazing and all characters are developed in a brilliant way through series. Around the show (episodes 40-53ish) in which the show drags incredibly, with the battles, monologue between the characters and suspense.
One of the best thing about Fullmetal Alchemist is it's characters. Every single character has a completely different personality and exceptional development, each one having their different reasons to act the way they do. Even the villains are awesome, with their dark stories and troubled personalities that make our heroes journey long and troublesome. It also has the best main villain of all times. Every character is amazing and all characters are developed in a brilliant way through series. You will fall in love with both protagonists as well as antagonists. One thing about the main character Edward was that I loved the way Edward was even arrogant and rude and maintained his persona until the last. That showed his flaw. He was the most human character possible in every way with his morals and ethics intact.
The music is just heart touching. Even the intensity they create through music in between is unmatchable. Animation is fantastic, less long fight scenes, short fight and battles are breathtaking.
It’s philosophical part is totally stunning. It even has a bloody philosopher stone:). It touches everything from nihilism, religion, god, law of equivalent exchange, Existentialism, Rationalism, life, fate, truth, humanity etc. every character has it’s own philosophy and there’s so much we can learn from each and every damn character.
One thing: Remember that full metal alchemist and full metal alchemist: brotherhood is different. Make sure to watch the latter one.",10

                This review contains spoilers:
Some people might prefer the tone of the first series. FMA was a seinen and FMAB is more of a shonen and both are great.
In general It´s such a good series I binge watched It in one and a half week. Though the first part It´s not so good and have some flaws like that the death of Coronel Hughes doesn´t have a great impact on the viewers beacause we don´t really get the chance to know him. The changes between drama and comedy aren´t well managed causing some akward moments.
But after the first part I was hooked up. The characters are
                  great both heroes and villains. Their development It´s overall pretty good and scenes like the moment Envy tried to provoke Mustang, Hawkeye, Edward and Scar to fight between them at almost the end of the series show us how much they have grow.
And the moment when Edward finally recover his arm thanks to the sacrifice of Alphonse to beat the shit out of Father It´s one of the most satisfactory moments in anime I have seen in a long time. The change between the sadness of the previous moment and the adrenaline, satisfaction and happiness  we feel seeing Edward humillate the main villain of the anime in front of everyone make me have a catharsis.
It´s not so long and you won´t regret It at all. Even If you saw the first adaptation before you´ll find something knew here and It´s not so long.
You could say It´s a masterpiece.",10

                I have a love-hate relationship with Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. 
First of all, I’d like to say that my main mistake was going in expecting it to blow me away and be the best anime of all time, which it wasn’t. If I found it of my own accord and watched it without knowing that fact I would have enjoyed it more, but it led to me watching it with a more cynical perspective and enjoying it less. However, I have gotten over this now and can now formulate a proper opinion. 
It’s good! It’s not a 10/10 or even a 9/10 for me, but it’s
                  a solid 8/10 and I can’t see myself putting it any lower than that. The episodes where significant things happened were very good and I felt that some episodes, mainly in the second part and towards the end, lived up to all the hype and were some great anime. Episode 4 and 60 were my favourites mainly since they were shocking and dark and episode 60 reminded me of a slightly worse version of End of Evangelion, but I had my jaw dropped for the last few minutes. 
Now comes the problems. First, I think that while the episodes with a lot going on or episodes that have strong emotional moments were great, lots of the other episodes fell into the “yeah it’s ok” category of 7/10, without that much interesting stuff happening, just moving the plot forwards. The main time I felt like this was during the 10 episodes that take place at Briggs. I didn’t like Sloth as a villain, I didn’t like the new characters that much, and I didn’t feel like anything big was really happening. 
My next big problem was the characters. Don’t worry, I’m not going to start saying why Ed, Al, Mustang or Hawkeye aren’t good characters, in fact I think they’re very well-written and I liked them a lot. I mean the insignificant side characters that didn’t have enough time to become interesting or developed, like the two sets of chimeras they pick up along the way who I couldn’t tell apart from each other, some of the Briggs soldiers, and even Kimblee. It wasn’t that I didn’t like them, it’s just the anime didn’t make me want to like them because they were mainly insignificant and just added to the pile of names I needed to remember, so by the later stages I felt like groaning every time another new character appeared. I also didn’t find The Father that great as a villain after episode 60. He just became a dude that they had to kill who was pure evil rather than being interesting, and I found the final battle a bit underwhelming 
My other problem with it that I can think of is that some fights were drawn out over several episodes and they just got tiring and I didn’t find them all that great. Examples include Armstrongs vs Sloth and the main group vs Pride. 
I’d like to end on a good note though, the main emotional moments were executed very well, like episode 4, 10, the moment with the 3rd of October, and the ending. This anime was more positive than negative, even if there were parts I didn’t like (and I didn’t go into the comedy aspects because I didn’t find it that bad and everyone talks about this already). I’ve decided to try out the original FMA 2003 to see what direction they went in after they overtook the manga and just to chill with the characters again, even if Greed (my favourite) won’t be there this time around since he was introduced later on.",8
"
                brotherhood is much more lore focused than the original fma but the overall emotional attachment to the characters is less than the predecessor, if you want to care about characters you need to watch the original brotherhood the very different endings are even more alarmingly different to see that mediocre ending show to me that the only reason to watch brotherhood is for the character development of the homunculus (especially greed) and the bigger dive into the lore of that fascinating universe.
ah and something to the newcomers that I only noticed at a grave in brotherhood is that the anime happens in the 1920s I
                  got my head crazy around the time were they story happens while watching until I saw it into a grave.",8

                Slade's Quick Review
If you liked full metal alchemist, may I introduce full metal alchemist: brotherhood. Both shows have almost all the same characters, concepts and settings. However the two couldn't feel more different. Brotherhood from what I have heard follows the manga closer then its brother show. This is good and bad, full metal (the short one) felt slower but had some very interesting things that made it great such as its omnipotence of The Gate, where as in brotherhood they gave it a face which I'm not sure if i liked. Brotherhood definitely has more action and better choreographed fights. The real issue is
                  that while most of the show differentiates itself from its counterpart they rush through the beginning as if they had expected you to watch the other one first but still makes you sit through a bunch a sh%t you already know. ""Yeah, I'm my own thing!... but you have to watch the other one if you want a good beginning...""",8
"
                Well well well....FMA. Yep, this is the one, the big one, the one everybody likes, the top anime of [i]all time[/i]. The anime you're [i]supposed[/i] to like and [i]have to[/i] like. 
Uh, so, this anime has serious issues, but nothing to do with foreign watchers or people who aren't Japanese. Look, the Ishvalan War thing is a dangerous territory for the Japanese. They actively try to ignore their history during WWII and don't go to much lengths to teach this history in schools. And tbh, to not teach about an atrocity is to commit the atrocity over and over again a thousand times. Japan still
                  has petty battles with S. Korea about the comfort women, which was basically slavery. And much could be said about how characters in FMA are basically war criminals. 
Now, depending on your view of war, this is either good or bad. I can't help but feel the author is trying to create an excuse for war criminals. ""They will lead a good life now so everything is fine!"" ""War criminals should not be prosecuted and hanged"" But in Germany they were, in Japan they were not, many were let go. So Japan got a 'special deal' after WWII, and the elders of Japanese society decided to hide these crimes and censor them. 
If you have any doubts, lookup Yasukuni Shrine, which enshrined war criminals and also has been accused of war loser's apologism against the United States. And you know, there's going to be some nuts and nationalists in every country. Hirohito it should be said was not pleased with Yasukuni's actions, and emperors and emperesses have not visited. So that's something. 
And you may say, what's that got to do with FMA? Well, a whole heck of a lot, because these pernicious attitudes show up again in Brotherhood. Maes Hughes, Hawkeye and Colonel Mustang all participate as class A war criminals in FMA and are seen as empathetic, good characters. The only character who wouldn't be a class A war criminal is Louis Armstrong. And the Elrich brothers support the state of Amestris' military who committed the war crimes. 
I think to S. Korean and Chinese people, watching a series about war criminals who commit atrocities and human experimentation is going to be a bit of a 'miss'. Part of this history is why S. Korean, Chinese to Japanese relations aren't as great as they could be, because Japan seems to refuse to acknowledge what they really did, that it was wrong, apologize and properly atone for their actions. This arrogance could be harmful in the future, especially considering growing Chinese nationalism these days. It's very concerning. 
So on that basis, the series has extreme, legitimate issues about war. A racial genocide just hangs like a sore fruit through the series. I can't tell how much the author knows about her country's history, or if FMA was meant to be war loser's apologism for young Japanese. I'm not Japanese! But it's highly suspicious. 
But this is really for Japanese and the Asian-Pacific theater countries. A lot of us are American and only think of Germany after the war, we don't consider Chinese genocide or Korean slavery by Japan during WWII. So, I guess I'll view it through the perspective of a western audience. 
Now that we have the hard politics out of the way, which you can make your own decision about, this adaptation is a full-on masterpiece. The music, character movement, story pace, are absolutely great! If you can forget about WWII war atrocities for a few minutes, it really is a breathtakingly beautiful series. 
In fact, tbh, this is more of a 32-hour long movie than an anime series in the classical sense. So, a shounen series that steals notes from Berserk adapted in movie quality is going to be hard to beat. It's some of the best cinematography in an 'anime series' you'll ever see outside Kyoto Animation or something. The direction is phenomenal and nearly every episode or action sequence has immense sakuga animation. It doesn't get a whole lot better. 
The adaptation of this anime? A ten, a full perfect ten, full-stop, no doubt, absolute perfect ten. Yep. Especially pretty is the Hohenheim episode where his philosopher stone victim/friends are dancing with him or he is having a dream. Very beautiful episode. You'll hardly see better outside of Mamoru Oshii movies. 
The way it looks, moves, flows, directed, pacing, tone, hitting on the mark (action coinciding with dialogue and the drama/plot of the story on time) are the best you'll probably ever see in anime. 
So, they budgeted a great all-time adaptation for this series. Which is why you should not skip any episodes. EVEN IF YOU HAVE WATCHED FMA 2003, WATCH FROM EPISODE ONE, since it adds to the epic pace and grandioseness of the story. Don't skip a darn one, start from one and move to 64. 
So no doubts about Bones' efforts here. So then the story. Well, it's a woman's story, and I'm not a woman. But it's nice. It's your classic collectivist shounen: friends make me complete and oh what would my life be without friends!? Which is basically the same as Gintama, Naruto and One Piece. Which makes it where I can't help but feel that this whole thing summates to Berserk-influence + Naruto Shippuden + extra steps. I couldn't make heads or tails out of what the author meant in regards to the homunculus and [spoiler]his desire for knowledge [/spoiler]or why he was wrong. None of it makes a lot of sense, and near the end we get into character-action-convenience to solve plot problems, like Kimblee showing up in Pride at the last minute to thwart his plans. 
Also, if you punch people hard enough, they will die. The only way to [spoiler]beat father is to punch him hard enough[/spoiler]. So, punching is really the solution for all of life's problems. 
Which is just like Naruto, One Piece, Gintama and every other shounen in existence. (Naruto Shippuden with extra steps). 
The plot has a lot of conveniences and deus ex machinas, something I don't like in my best stories. Stuff doesn't make sense and isn't explained, like the lore of the homunculus or his motivations until the very last minute. Nor are they completely satisfactory. They're merely good enough to 'pass with a C'. So it's best not to spend much time on the philosophy, lore or history of this series, which is just like all or most shounens in that regard. 
So, the story? 4? It's not that great. In my head it's around a two, but since it's just anime I'd put it higher. It's not worth debating much because all shounen is the same. 
Who cares? Nobody is going to read much into the story, especially considering the fact that the main theme is human humbleness, and the fans of this show downvote other shows that get even close to it in the charts. So nobody is watching this for some masterpiece story. 
Comparison? There's the fun.

Togashi is a masterful storyteller who doesn't need a masterpiece adaptation to make masterpieces, just give him good enough. Winner: HXH.

There's a reason Oda-sensei is top of his game, his stories are ingenious and work like clever clocks. The adaptation is good enough. Winner: OP
[i]AOT[/i]
Uh, AOT is all over the place and its lore is WAY worse and less clear than Brohood. Winner: Brohood
[i]Gintama[/i]
Uh, Gintama is all over the place and mostly a comedy, it's not a fair comparison since Gintama never promised to be anything other than a lampoon of shounens. Winner: Brohood

[i]JoJo's[/i]
JoJos is too much fun and far too brilliant with intricate plots. Winner: JoJo
[i]Monogatari[/i]
Monogatari has this wrapped up from the first episode, since it's not average shounencore. Winner: Monogatari, but it's the greatest AOAT, so not a hard choice. 
As a movie, Brohood is okay. Akira and most Oshiis are better. It's simply a cinematic fandaptation of another shounen, so it's an in-universe adaptation, like any Naruto movie. Same class as Naruto Shippuden films. 
Yeah, so it's okay, but people are trying way too hard to turn a molehill into a mountain with this series. It's got its idiosyncratic Japaneseness like anything else. Don't like lolis? Try war atrocities on, how does that fit you? All anime are anime. Really, the only universal animes that don't fall into this trap are the big shounens: My Hero Academia, One Piece, Naruto. Extremely popular stuff, but anything will have a bit of its nation's influence stuck into it, that's natural. Also, I'm not saying America doesn't have southern civil war losers' apologism or voting rights suppression or The Trail of Tears or Japanese internment camps, but we teach those things in school and people are aware of them and discuss them openly. We don't hide from the bad things we have done, and if people do they get caught and left to rot on Twitter or bad press. Our first amendment is supposed to mean we talk about everything, nothing is hidden. Maybe we don't always live up to it but we try. 
All bad, rotten things should see the light of day, don't hide from them, and don't inculcate an apologist's propaganda to somehow 'forgive' yourself of your sins so you can just move past them without discussing them. That's how the problem resurfaces generations later. You have to be open and honest and discuss your faults as much as your glories. 
You can't be perfect, but you can try. Which I thought was a low bar. 
Either way, watching this series from the bottom up was a fun experience. It's a pretty good movie in the FMA universe. And the ending is pretty cool. I wish I hadn't skipped the first twenty episodes years back on Reddit advice, that was dumb. And since most people voting on here aren't Japanese, you can enjoy this series at least 70% without considering the problematic Japanese war history that their elders should've dealt with generations ago. 
I agree that this series is going to be hard to beat since it's 32-hours of movie quality with a pretty good story. It's also somewhat pro-mothers and women and feminist which is a good point. But if it was up to women, men wouldn't tinker with technology and would've been fine staying in their hut with their children and never arguing with their wife. As a man, I can tell you, that way lies insanity. 
So considering the censored war history and wrong view of war criminals, this pernicious angle cancels out the good of the feminism for me, which I didn't ask for in the first place. So all its left with is faulty plot mechanics of convenience to tie together the story the author wanted, all neat and clean. Personally, I like a story dirtier, ragged, edgier, breaking through the polite walls of heart and hearth and seeing the free world and breathing the clean air. I want to break through. 
So, not necessarily my bag but I guess I can respect it if it's your thing. There are other series and anime I want to see get this good of an adaptation and I have a hard time believing I'm ever going to get it, which leads to the question: why this series? Why did FMA receive SUCH a good adaptation? Because of sales? Or because it logicalizes Japan's war history for them? Hmmmm, just a question I'll leave out there. 
I won't bash people who enjoy this series, just as long as you consider the implications of the war stuff and consider it thoughtfully. Overall it's pretty good and worth remembering, but it may be the most problematic manga in the canon. Hey, the author brought it up, not me!",8
"
                So I remember watching the first adaptation of this story about a month before I watched this and I thought the original adaptation was great and I loved it except for the ending but now that I watched this I figured out I was wrong this is definitely the greatest anime I've ever seen and I love it so much. The characters, the story, the art, and the sound and I had a great time over the entire show I was never bored it was always interesting and never failed to deliver excitement. I would recommend this show to any fan of anime because of
                  the top tier quality of this show.",10

                Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is one of those extremely rare moments in anime (or entertainment in general) where an artist has one very specific vision, idea, goal etc and executes on those fundamentals outstandingly without compromise! 
FMA is the brainchild of talented female manga writer and artist Hiromu Arakawa and chronicles the journey of two brothers in search of a fantastical stone called the ""philosopher's stone"" in hopes of using it to get their bodies back. In this quest they meet a myriad of allies and foes ranging from different ethnicities, ideologies, motivations, abilities etc. As well as unearthing dark secrets surrounding their country and
                  government, the morality on the alchemy they use and the murky concept of God. FMAB with its straightforward premise takes on and successfully tackles topics like racism, God V. Science, war, Morality, Immortality etc without ever tripping over itself, overwhelming the viewer and keeping the tone from getting too dark. 
The Animation Behind FMAB is handled by none other then the wonderful studio bones! the steampunk setting is fully realized and brought to life thanks to stunning backgrounds and vistas, fluid character animation and flawless shonen action scenes that put the genres titans to absolute shame! most action or fight scenes in Shonen Anime usually bore me to tears with their terrible pacing, incessant padding and drawn out length. Battles in FMA end as quickly as they suddenly start, dazzling you with absolute stunning choreography and slick animation. needless to say you wont be waiting multiple episodes to finish one fight. 
The entire Score behind FMAB is composed by Akira Senju and while I admittedly am unfamiliar with his previous works, after watching FMAB I really think every animation studio whose serious about making a serious anime should consider hiring him! The music behind the show is simply godlike with its angelic and chilling tracks like the main theme, requiem for the brigadier general, beyond these walls etc to Military hymns like Heroic Bolero, the next chapter, the intrepid, fanfare for the brave, battle scherzo and more! The sound design behind FMAB is absolutely top tier and really comes to life when watching on a 50 inch tv and surround speakers. Gunshots, explosions and all special effects overall have movie like quality to them and really makes you wonder what the standards for other animation studios are. the last few episodes in general really sounded like I was in a movie theater!
The characters behind FMAB are what really make the show what it is. unlike a lot of shonen anime where the cast gets so big it inevitably forgets characters or has a humongous gap in relevancy or importance, FMAB miraculously avoids these pitfalls while having a pretty sizable cast. without spoiling anything I can say that the heroes are heroic and brave but not unbelievably so, most of them suffering with some sort of trauma or problematic past and its watching them power through these struggles to be the hero's their world needs is what makes them so compelling alongside their beforementioned ideologies, pasts and motivations. The same is also true for the villains.
In a era where more and more Shonens are being published everyday it can be to sit down and figure which one you would like to sink your attention into but. However if you could only pick one I would most certainly recommend FMAB. It's a well crafted story that won't cost you a lifetime of watching devotion.

                Of course, why not 10/10, this is how anime should be. Almost perfect at every aspect. No waste character, no waste plot, everything is good.
As an anime that released on 2009, this is actually very good for me. And IMHO, this anime can still relate until nowadays. Forget rivalry with AOT, AOT has its own world. As for me, Bones do very well job at everything. And they still doing good until today. 
Opening and Ending Song is good enough for me, especially first opening and last opening. YUI and SID do really good job for this one. its almost iconic.

                Full Metal Alchemist is an extremely popular franchise. I had watched the original series a few years ago and enjoyed it, but I didn't think that it was the greatest series in the world. However, the characters in the show stuck with me like few ever have. I was eager to see how FMA Brotherhood lived up to the original-and it surpassed it. This anime does everything right-a great plot that is intricately woven and resolves everything, terrifying villains, breathtaking action sequences, drama, humor, joy- It does it all perfectly. I am normally one that enjoys more obscure and unpopular anime as I grow older,
                  but this somehow eked it's way into one of the top 5 best anime I have ever watched. A required view for all anime fans.",10

                Not many words can describe this anime but a few do come to mind when i think of this anime, epic, masterpiece, awesome.These are the words that come to my mind when i think of full metal alchemist brotherhood.
Story- i have not seen the original FMA but after seeing this i might be interested to see it. The story is the most original and interesting story that i have every seen, it is very interesting an throughout the whole thing you are wanting to know what happens next and eager for the next episode. It is very hard to tell a part of the story
                  without giving spoilers but the main idea of the story is the main characters Edward and Alphonse Elric lost there mother from an illness and they try to bring her back with alchemy but human transmutation is a taboo among alchemist and Alphonse loses his whole body and his soul is binded to a suite of armor, Edward loses his left leg from trying to bring back his mother and he loses his right arm from putting the soul of Alphonse into the suite of armor and they are trying to get there real bodies back throughout the series.
story- 10/10
Art- The art in FMA brotherhood is very well done also. The lightening from the alchemy is drawn very well and the character models are very original, instead of having the normal triangle shaped face with the sharp chins in most anime's, FMA brotherhood go's for more of a realistic art style for the character models that is very appealing and nice the see a change in character models for a change.
Art- 10/10
Sound- The sound in FMA brotherhood is some of the best sound effects i have ever heard in an anime, it could be the lightening sounds from when they use their alchemy or when someone get punched in the face, all of it sounds very convincing and very very top notch.
Sound-10/10
Characters- One thing that i do believe is better than the story is the characters. The characters are the biggest stand out for me, all of them are very relatible and are very fun to see in the show. There is the stubborn kid who does not give up on what he wants, the naive brother and so much more characters that i will not tell any of the names. It is very hard to tell some of the characters of the show without telling any spoilers and this is definitely an anime you want to watch with absolutely no spoilers. That being said this anime has my favorite characters of any anime so far and on another note the English dubs are some of the best i have heard as well.
characters 10/10
Enjoyment- ah it still gets me a little sad to think that i actually finished it, i have never gotten this much enjoyment from an anime and you will not be disappointed either.
Enjoyment 10/10
Overall- Overall this is going to be without a doubt one of the best anime's that you will ever see, the story is interesting, original and compelling. Art is also original and very well detailed. Sound is top notch and very nice to listen to. Characters are the biggest strong point in this anime with great relatable characters that you get attached to very quickly. The enjoyment is great and getting close to the end of the epic story you realize that you don't want it to be over. Overall everything in this anime is top notch and you will not want it to be over 
Overall- 10/10",10

                Despite having some good reviews, i didn't watch the first version of Full Metal Alchemist, so i can't make the comparison with the original.
It is a great anime, and my favorite, to be more precise. When you start watching it you can't stop until you finished.
To support my review, i'll give you some points.
It has engaging characters, not only the mc is developed, like Mustang or even Winry, a nice story, which does turnarounds and have little plot twists and good soundtrack. 
And one of the most important points for me, it ends in the right time (unlike Death Note, that in my opinion should
                  end in L's death).
My overall rating is 10/10.",10

                Alright, this is my first anime review so bare with me ;-)
(P.S no spoilers in this review)
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, an anime one of my friends have been hyping me up to watch, claiming it was the best anime he'd ever watched. I already had a watch list and wanted to save Fullmetal for later but the hype was unreal I had to put Samurai Champloo on hold to watch this. Giving it some thought after watching this I can see why people would consider Fullmetal the best anime in the world, thou I will say in my opinion it didn't live up to the hype
                  I've heard about, yet it still didn't disappoint.
Story: 8/10
The story is actually pretty unique compared to other anime I've viewed over some time, turning the elements science into a type of power and having the ability to use matter or substances around you to your advantage is something I would have never imagined. The story starts off nice and basic starring the two Elric brothers trying to fulfil their goals (like any other main protagonists), but the more in depth you are in the story, the more secrets that are revealed, the plot twists in the story make it even more worthwhile. I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 because even though the story was great, I felt like they could of expanded the story more  and really get more in depth with certain things and characters which is why instead of a 9 I make it 8.
Art: 8/10
I never have a problem with art when it comes to anime. I will say the art is good, shouldn't have any complaints I think. For art I would give it a 7/10 but because the animation goes so well with the art and even amazes me at times seeing how it was made back in 2009, gonna have to give it that boost.
Sound: 8/10
The OSTs used in Fullmetal are used so well and are played at the right moments. They're pretty nice to listen, especially the OPs and EDs, they go crazy. I watched Fullmetal in sub so I don't know about English voice actors but the Japanese voice actors voiced their characters quite well (P.S for those who have watched one piece, you may notice the voice actors of Zoro, Franky and Nami are in the anime). Thus giving the sound an 8/10.
Character: 6/10
I won't lie, at the start of the series I thought everyone fitted their roles perfectly, all had their own personalities and found it quite cool, but as I continued to watch Fullmetal I kind of started getting annoyed on how some of the characters began to behave. Everyone has their own ideals and opinion for what's good and bad and I respect that, but sometimes the Elric brothers can be pretty hypocritical at times when it comes to judging people for their actions, then again it's not like I don't completely understand why they do it (Also the attuite given from certain characters some times ticks me off). In some ways as you journey through the series, some have good character development as they progress, some should of had more. Therefore I give Character a 6/10.
Enjoyment: 6/10
I actually enjoyed this series a lot and I would of given this an 8/10 but a few things put me off. I've practically enjoyed every moment of the series, at the start the pacing of Fullmetal seemed pretty fast as if they were trying to get all the early information out of the way, but soon slows a bit down and has a moderate pace which becomes enjoyable and understanding to watch. Then near the ending arc, what felt like it should of taken like at most 4-6 eps, it was pretty dragged to the point where I was wondering when are they going to finish. So that brings it down to a 7/10, thou I will admit the reason I brought it down to a 6 was kind of a bias reason. I heard so much hype from this anime and I guess since the anime didn't meet my expectations of hype it kind of ruined the experience for me a bit, which is why I rate my enjoyment 6/10 (you can ignore this if you want and consider it a 7/10, I don't mind tbh).
Overall: 7/10
Yeah this anime has it's ups and downs, the mean of the ratings I've given above makes an overall of 7.2/10 but you know, 7 on this website so yeah, 7/10. I haven't read the manga nor seen the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime adaption (2003 version) but I'm pretty pleased with this anime, not my top 5 but wouldn't mind re-watching. Then again you may have a different opinion to me and enjoy it more than I did (or dislike it more). Anyway that's my review, cheers for reading my view of things :-)",7

                Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,I remember when before pandemi,in days when teachers dont come at school I stayed and I watched this anime,ok this happend just one time but it was good,one of my favorites thincs about this anime is that he is not overrated,its a masterpiece and every body knows that,the story is simple but is just,perfect.In this anime is about 2 brothers who want to take their bodys back because they lost it when they tried to revive a dead persona,but like others anime,need to exist a antagonist,the antagonist name is humununcul,but other humununculs know him as father,he look like Edward father but he lived centuries,he created
                  another humunuculs using his emotions,to make alchemi you need to give a a think who have the same price like the think you want to transmutate,the entire anime is based on this,our protagonists wants a philosopher stone because if they have one,they will can take their body back,philosopher stones are maked with humans souls,the anime have plot twists and this make him very interesting,is not just 2 brothers who wants their bodys back,its more and that is what make him a masterpiece.",10
"
                CONTAINS LITTLE SPOILERS
When I saw FMA at the top anime I started to wonder why it had the best rating out of all of the animes. It had a better rating than all the classic animes everyone likes, so I decided to check it out and I wasn't disappointed. This truly is a masterpiece. 
Story: 10/10
The story is great, with multiple people trying to accomplish a single goal unlike one or two people in most animes. The story has a perfect blend of humor sadness and a little romance. I can see why it has a high rating, the story is very enjoyable. I think
                  the story is liked because it has an ending a lot of people wanted. 
Art/Sound: 10/10
The animation is godlike, the way they animate the character transformations and alchemy are perfect. The colors they use to for the sets blend in very well with the animation. The whole animation is very fluid, the attention to detail is even better too, not a dull point in the art. The sound is great too, it matches perfectly with animation even when I tried I couldn't find a mistake in it. 
Character: 10/10
All the character shows were made very well but the homunculi were perfect. What's best is they match with their name which makes the fights and encounters with the protagonists even better. All the other characters are great too but Mustang and Edwards are by far the best out of the protagonists, those two really made the show more enjoyable than it was. Another character that was great was Ling's/greed split personality, I wanted them to stay like that until the end. 
Overall: 10/10
I like anime a lot so my reviews are very high but I didn't think I was going to like it this much. Would I recommend it to others, of course, now I see why this gets such high praise from the reviewers.",10
"
                The first manga I ever read, and the first anime I ever watched -- and boy am I glad. Fullmetal Alchemist is a classic, one of those incredibly rare shows that does *everything* right. The world is quirky and engaging, the production quality is top-notch (with special shoutouts to the soundtrack), and the story features some of the best characters and dramatic moments in anime. 
It should say something that this show is ranked #1 on MAL; there's a whole lot to love, regardless of who you are or what you like. I don't think it's perfect, but it's about as good an introduction as
                  any if you're trying to get your friends into anime.",9
"
                   This anime has it all: realistic and exciting characters, an intricate and interesting plot, profound moments of symbolism and even philosophy, strokes of tragedy, romance, humor, and action. 
   The anime's only problem? It was too long.
   Honestly, all the anime's best moments could have fit in half as many episodes, easily. The other half of the show (the ones it could do without) is composed of abundant violence, which unfortunately pales in comparison with mainstream shonen.
   If you're easily bored, or impatient this might not be for you.
   But I know there are
                  some of you out there, who think 64 episodes is nothing. 
   In short, if you can bring yourself to watch it, watch it.",8
"
                overall a great show that i would not mind watching again and its highs are so high it really did hit close to heart, had me crying out of hype, sadness, happiness. It had its fair share of gore fair share of comedy and serious moments and hype moments ( i am sure you know which part i am talking about), totally a binge-able show gets you hooked right away, the characters were not the dull. Everyone had their own problems goals pasts. As far as i have noticed there were not any plot holes that made me ask why, felt like i understood everything,
                  i personally like the ending a lot, power system is balanced i would say, and he did not have any weird ass op only-mc type powers so that was nice as well.",10
"
                I have never really gotten into anime up until i watched Fullmetal alchemist: Brotherhood. I decided to watch it after a friend let me borrow a copy of the manga and i really enjoyed the story, so i decided to watch brotherhood (I skipped tbe original because i like to stick to whats canon). and watching this show at first was kind of a nice turn from the normal mainstream anime i had been watching at the time. but then, once i really got into it, i found myself astounded by the story, the plot, the characters, and the emotions i felt watching this was
                  amazing. I could sit and watch other shows with some pretty emontional scenes, but brotherhood had a lot of effort put into it and it really got me feeling for the characters. i just wanna say thank you to all the people who poured there heart and soul into this, it was the most amazing thing i have seen in my life and this show will always hold a very special place in my heart. I just can't wait to have kids so i can show them this (Don't judge me, it demonstrates good morals to have in life)!",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is probably the peak of the 2000s shounen anime. Where high-production anime of a similar era (i.e. Bleach and Naruto) built compelling worlds but at the expense of interesting characters and plot development, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has no such flaw. Characters are fleshed-out while the story has excellent pacing and intensity. 
Like other anime that heavily rely on world-building, the details of alchemy and its role are explored deeply, but, quite uniquely, are never forced. The fluid animation and action sequences only add to how captivating the world is. (I think every child who's watched FMA growing up has copied a transmutation
                  circle on a piece of paper, then clapped their hands together.)
The series is also experimental in some ways– while still retaining a comedic tone similar to many other shounen anime, themes such as the nature of truth, science and ethics, as well as personhood are explored with refreshing depth and severity.",10
"
                Unlike the 2003 version, this one is not very introductory, some things that exist in the manga and were presented in the previous version were cut, but nothing that interferes with the unfolding of the plot, it's just a detail. The redemption plot, which differs from the ""shonen"" standards, in addition to addressing complex themes of genocide and racism, are part of these themes. Another negative point, which in the other version did not exist, is the controversy of addressing racism and using stereotypes in the design of certain characters. The soundtrack, which was already a good thing in the 2003 version, got even better
                  in this one (even the Dante theme exists). Speaking of the devil, in the other version, a new character was created, which completely changed the story, which was something more selfish, became something more romantic, with the right to the existence of a parallel universe, and an externally frustrating ending, which yielded a mediocre film. Even with some flaws, I consider this one more faithful to the original and consequently better.",9
"
                i have to say when i first heard about fullmetal alchemist brotherhood i had serious doubts about watching it, and that was way back when it was airing. i have never enjoyed an anime as much as this one, that is why i gave the scoring all tens. just to let you know this is the only anime that i have ever given a 10 score on my list. the story was outstanding and i was realy caught up in it from the beginning. to be honest there where a few episodes that were not needed in my opinion but the majority of anime is
                  like that. i had always liked the art style from the first fullmetal but in this anime it is slightly different, and if i had to compare it i would say it is sharper and slightly if not more detailed better drawn. for voices etc. i would have to say the subbed version is better than the english dubbed but that is due to my personal preference since i have trouble watching dubbed anime. as for characters Edward is my favorite but overall they are well made and distinct with unique personalities. i shouldn't have to explain my enjoyment that much since i explained most of it, but i will warn you that this anime is beyond awesome.",10
"
                Let me start with this anime is overhyped beyond belief. Now don't get me wrong it is a great anime with a amazing story with some really loveable characters, along with that it has a great dub.  The first 3 parts are amazing but then towards the last couple parts i felt the story was getting drawn out a bit. I found myself still enjoying the anime I was just a little less engaged. Without getting into spoilers I felt like some really absurd things happened that shouldn't have happened. It had some good character development however with a good plot nothing bad just
                  definitely over hyped I would still highly recommend watching it.
                             My personal rating 8.5/10",8
"
                I can't recommend this show enough to people and anime watchers.
This show has some the best story, characters, sound design, music, and writing I've seen in an anime.
All the characters in the story are vital none of them feel ""useless"" and they all have their own personalities, goals, and ideals they live by. All the characters have their own reasons for coming into the story and all have some kind of pay off and it's excellently well-done.
All the episodes feel like they belong, there's no filler stuff like the original series, every episode develops the show in some way and it doesn't waste any time
                  with the viewer, which is BIG plus for longer shows like this.
The music is orchestral and really adds to every scene that it's put in, making both the scene and song more memorable. Though the emotional songs of FMA 2003 are also quite excellent as well.
Openings are some of my favorites in all of anime (do I even NEED to mention which one it is at this point?) Some good rock and pop mixes of tunes.
Wish I could go into more detail, but it's REALLY a show that has to be seen to TRULY understand it and see the master workmanship in it. Definitely give it a watch.",10
"
                I have not seen the original FMA because I got quickly bored with it because it felt like the target audience was a young age group of about 8-12. With this rebooted version, this is not the case what-so-ever.
This anime is action packed, fantastic storyline, and one of the most emotional animes I have seen so far (I cried A LOT). The OST for this anime is phenomenal, the characters are amazing and to top it off it has an awesome storyline* and great voice actors**. I heavily enjoyed this anime and I would recommend it to anyone.
*I didn't like the way it ended however,
                  and I judge about 60% of the anime on it's ending, so this is the only reason it scores #6 on my list of favorite completed animes.
**I watch the dubs of an anime whenever possible.
Final Spoiler Notes: My only gripe was that- FINAL CHANCE SPOILERS -Ed and Winry, and Hawkeye and Mustang didn't have bigger romantic relationships, because I enjoy that sort of thing, you may not though so you don't have to worry about it.",9
"
                How does one even properly begin a review of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood? By discussing its legendary status? By laying out the tricky relationship with its 2003 sibling? One thing is for sure, Hiromu Arakawa created something special when Enix began publishing her manga back in 2001. Brotherhood's top rating here MAL is not difficult to understand in the slightest. It is arguably the most accessible anime program to ever grace the world. The characters are indelibly likable, with strong personalities, distinct appearances, and well-defined goals. The setting is both immediately familiar in its parallels to early 20th century Europe and intriguing with its underlying mechanics
                  of alchemy. The story is straightforward and never devolves into the confusing, bizarre, or abstract jigsaw puzzle-plotting so common in anime despite expanding its scope to cover many characters and a political conspiracy. Both Japanese and English VAs are top notch. And while the blending of drama and comedy can often be abrasive (notoriously so), I find that it only adds to the endearing qualities of the show. Brotherhood is some of the best YA fiction around, with a little something for everyone, and offers what I consider to be an almost perfect entry point into the universe of Japanese animation.
I say ""almost"" because there is a catch. Brotherhood can only barely be considered a stand-alone work. The figure of Studio Bones's first FMA adaption, which began airing in 2003, looms large over Brotherhood. Whereas the older adaption only managed to cover part of Arakawa's story before catching up to the source material, forcing the writers to take things in their own direction, Brotherhood tells the mangaka's version of the story in its entirety. Needless to say there is much overlap between the two and the consequence is obvious to anyone who has seen both. Brotherhood more or less assumes its audience is familiar with the ground covered by FMA 2003, condensing ~28 episodes worth of material into 14. 
Nowhere is this flippant attitude towards the viewer more obvious than the first episode. With original content not found within the pages of the source material, Brotherhood's first episode plays more like the beginning of a movie in an established franchise (no different than Conqueror of Shamballa or Sacred Star of Milos really), than a proper introduction to its world and characters. Many characters are introduced. Specific events and plot points are name-dropped like crazy. Even the true evil nature of an important character, which is supposed to be a major plot reveal, is less than subtly foreshadowed.  Clearly there is an expectation that we already know all this. 
Brotherhood proceeds to quickly plow through the redundant material from here. While this is understandable, and serves as a decent refresher for the already initiated, it makes for a less than ideal experience for first-time watchers. Granted, there's nothing missing from the early parts of the story. Everything anyone needs to know is covered. But it's done at the sacrifice of real impact and character development. These early parts of the story are key to understanding who the Elric brothers are, how they think and approach problems, what their strengths and weaknesses are, etc. Such clarifying moments are abridged, or even cut out entirely if they don't serve an understanding of the larger story. Worse yet is the execution. Watching FMA 2003 and Brotherhood back to back reveals how much better the former handled these moments. Brotherhood's direction is often flat, with excessive use of odd visual gimmicks like splitscreens, fish-eyed perspectives, and dutch angles. The music can be insufficient or even inappropriate. Brotherhood just lacks the subtle atmosphere of horror and gut-punching impact of its 2003 counterpart. This is a deal breaker, especially when the most dramatic and heavy hitting moments come in this part of the story.*
Thankfully, Brotherhood quickly finds its footing with the introduction of a few new characters unfamiliar to 2003 veterans. It's clear at this moment that Brotherhood is more interested in a bigger picture. Whereas FMA 2003 never gave the country of its setting a name or any geopolitical details, Brotherhood gives us Amestris, a map, and bordering neighbors with a history. This is a bigger story, a more political story, and (for better or worse) a less tragic and Elric brothers-driven story.  The climax is wonderfully epic, finding clever ways to work in the enormous cast, but one can't help but feel some dramatic absence in the mix. While 2003 Ed and Al never lose sight of their goal to get their bodies back, as the motivations of companions and enemies alike converge on its central rule-breaking Philosopher Stone, Brotherhood's dual protagonists get caught up in the whirlwind of conspiracy and cosmic threats. I prefer the persistent and intimate tragedy and horror elements of FMA 2003 (along with its more classic art and storyboarding) than the more traditional machinations of Brotherhood, but the latter can certainly pull it off like no other. Studio Bones manages to do so with gusto thanks to some stellar production values carried across an impressive 64 episodes. 
*Honestly, I strongly recommend watching the 2003 series first. It can make the viewing of Brotherhood more fuller with the characters already being fleshed out. Plus, it's refreshing to see how the story diverges, where mysteries that were solved by the 2003 series are revitalized as they take on new tantalizing intrigue.",7
"
                Depending on your age and disposition, battle shounen can be an endless source of entertainment or a tedious, tired proposal. Brotherhood--a faithful adaptation of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, unlike the 2003 TV series--is very much beholden to the tropes of its genre, but rises above most of its peers thanks to its laser-like storytelling focus. A well-developed magic system, an appealing 20th-century steampunk setting, and fantastically fluid action scenes make it one of the most satisfying anime of its kind. It's also willing to indulge in political commentary the likes of which most shounen would consider overly polemic, asking questions such as: is war ever
                  justified? Can you really change institutions from within? Does industrial society put a price tag on human life? And while the ending is a little trite and the 2003 adaptation had a handful of better individual episodes, the beginning-to-end experience of Brotherhood is practically unmatched in shounen.",8

Characters: 9/10Through the series we meet various characters with different personalities, different abilities etc. it makes world of Fullmetal very lively.
Character progression: 9/10
Our MCs are deeply developed and explored, we see their past, their attempt to resurrect their mother, their training and their path to get back limbs and body which were taken away as a fee to the ritual of resurrection ( failed). Even side characters are heavily invested, some change their beliefs through the series, some comes to our heroes side ( Greed) and etc.
Story: 9/10
Story goal is quite simple our MCs are trying to get back their limbs and body, so they enlist to te army in order to fasten their research. This doesn't go well as planned and our characters later has to stop destruction of their country and stop Homunculi from becoming a god.
Story progression: 10/10
This is outstanding. This is masterpiece. There are many side episodes, but NOT even once I felt they were unnecesary or boring or just time extension. Every side episode was interesting and it added something new to our main story, I have to applause to the studio and I think this was masterfully done.
Villains: 9/10
Homunculi family: 9/10 They are creations of the 1st Homunculi and are absolutely loyal to him except of Greed. We get to see them trying to stop our MCs in their effort, but they are also taking care of our protagonists so they can use them in ritual, which will allow 1st Homunculi becoming a god. Even though they are not humans they show emotions towards humans. Pride loves his human mother, Envy is envious of humans. They were very well done villains, which I liked to see everytime they appeared and that is a good villain by my book.
"" Father"" 1st Homunculi: 9/10 He's creation of Hohenheim ( father of our MCs), he wished to get out of bottle which he managed after a ritual which was supposed to give immortality to the emperor, but Homunculi tricked him and gave it to Hohenheim and he appeared as human looking being, his ultimate goal is to become a god. He isn't "" unnecesary evil ( that means he doesn't do thing which would artificially make him hateable villain)"".
Sound: 8/10
Fullmetal offer many soundtracks, though I didn't found any that struck to me, but that doesn't mean they're bad I think they are pretty good, but they just didn't struck to me.
Sooo overall rating of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is 9/10 exact. As I am writing this, Fullmetal has the best rating in my reviews, so I guess it deserves it's spot yet.",9
"
                ""Deserving of its #1 title on MyAnimeList and many other sites that it claims"", is something that I'd say about the shows, and for different reasons than to other people might give, this show is NOT my favourite and isn't even close, so then what's deserving about this show to be so high up and deserving you might ask as a casual viewer, answer is simple, objectively, it's the most well written and broad mainstream I have ever watched and probably ever will. 
While some people choose to reject the fact that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is good, either because they watched it's anime predecessor
                  or aren't a fan of the concept, what they are unable to escape from is that objectively speaking, the writing is about as perfect as you can get in the anime medium, name me one plot hole or flaw worth speech, you can name any small ones, but are they really worth throwing a show over? Even so these details are just ignored and are in the manga, overall, it's just super difficult to prove Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood as bad in any way, I guess the only real negative comment you can make with any sort of valid point to it is either that it's a generic battle shounen (which means nothing for its quality), or that it just isn't your kind of show, which is respectable which leads me to my next point of discussion.
Moving on from the objective quality, is a topic I found to be more relevant to my personal placement on my list. Despite the broad demographic that this story connects with; that being the shounen demographic, and relatable theming that most people can connect with and empathize, is that the show does not meet my own personal quota for philosophy and psychology. While this seems generic you can talk to any psychological fan such as myself, who will admit to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhoods quality, but who also fail to enjoy it as much as other shows due to its lack in that general department of anime. Which proves that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhoods only ""flaw"" is that its genre is so broad it fails to connect with people who like niche and exotic shows. Which if anything is more of a compliment, just saying that the show is so easy to follow that it is, as you could put it, ""boring"" because it does not require much amount of thinking to really get or understand, which brings me to my last point of this review: 
How can a show have a meaning and a lesson for the viewers to take away, and yet be so easy to understand that it can get through to even the most braindead and stingy people? Simple, something so common place that most people overlook, equivalent exchange. You pay for bread with money you worked hard for, that's time out of your day to earn those coins, which you exchange for bread worth the same amount, it's so simple yet so overlooked that when it's shown to anyone, they realize how much they connect with it and are almost blown away or at the very least impressed to an extent, it's hard to find any well recognized shows, or even shows in general, which bring you something so simple yet so ingenious, which happens to be Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhoods greatest strength.
To conclude, this show may not be for everyone, and anyone can escape from watching it or accepting that it is a good show, but what you cannot escape is how well written this show is, writing, moral, character, pacing, and all, it's pretty much impossible for you to give a valid reason to say that this show is even mediocre, so submit to equivalent exchange, spend 24 hours of your life, and appreciate the unembellished genius of the show.",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one of those rare anime series that found acclaim all around the world. The reviews in this forum has already shown how popular it is in the Anglosphere. I just like to add on that in her native country, Japan and in the Sinosphere, this anime received similar universal praise. For example, on douban (the most critical Chinese movie review site), it has a rating of 9.4, the best of any anime. In Taiwan, it was voted unanimously as the best in the last decade on a similar review site. In Japan, Arakawa has won two awards for the manga and
                  was consistently voted as one of the best anime/manga ever. So why do this story resonates with so many people across different cultures? Perhaps, it is because its story is on an epic scale spanning several regions/countries. It deals with moral values and dilemmas that would concern any human. Its characters are relatable and believable. Its pacing is astoundingly crisp and to the point. The artwork especially the fight scenes are done extremely well. The story has a satisfying conclusion and feels complete. It is certainly not perfect but every aspect of this shonen anime is near the very best of its genre. If only I can write and draw as well as Arakawa...",10

                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (Bones)
Part 1: (Episodes 1-13) Sometimes I wish this show went full edge-lord and took the dark topics that it has and rolled with them while omitting the goofy cringe anime humor. (See that section below) But at the same time, I love the Elric brother's relationship with each other and their backstory. And even though Lieutenant Colonel Hughes was annoying at times, I did like his character, and like that his death is sparking a darker tone in the story, and am curious to see how the brothers react to it. The show has a lot of potential. I am enjoying it,
                  but I feel like it will grow in quality in its upcoming seasons. 6/10
Part 2: (Episodes 14-26) As I suspected, the show really gets kicked into gear upon the death of Hughes which thrusts us into a political thriller with Homunculi entities as enemies which exhibit traits of the Seven Deadly Sins. Early on the show did a good job of making me mistrust Colonel Mustang before letting us know how brilliant he's going to be. He's wildly outmatched against an enemy that has powers that we can't even fathom, but so long as he's still breathing, he's a guy that you can't count out. He reminds me of Captain Levi from Attack on Titan and he's a badass that is easy to root for. As for the Elric brothers, Ed still is prone to his childish outbursts, but the duo go through some heavy character growth when they revisited their old teacher and inevitably get lumped into Mustang's plot to stop the Homunculi. I suspected that the show was going to get better, but I never anticipated it getting better this fast and staying consistent. The themes of the show get darker each episode with the philosophical question of what makes us human and what the value of a soul is being asked in a variety of ways. Unlike season 1, this season ends at an appropriate time leaving a lot of questions left unanswered and a few encounters awaiting the brothers with their father. God damn that ""Let It All Out"" song hit me in the feelz right there at the end. 9/10
Part 3: (Episodes 27-39) The show continues to be strong as it builds upon the fantastic season 2. We get the backstory on the Ishvalon War, our heroes are halted in their plans of overthrowing the Fuhrer, and the Homunculi's plans of creating a new Philosopher's Stone seem to be progressing while Colonel Mustang tries to fight from the shadows with his allies purposefully scattered by the Fuhrer. Scar and May Chang try to find out the purpose of his brother's research in the hopes of getting vengeance on those that caused the Ishvalon genocide while Ed and Al continue looking into how to get their bodies back with their new lead being the alchemy of the Ishvalons somehow being unaffected by the Homunculi's temporary blockage. There's a lot of intrigue in this season and it continues to build up to bigger and better things... 9/10
Part 4: (Episodes 40-52) Kimblee is an awesome antagonist. I love how he is limited in what he can do to the Elrics because of working for the Homunculi but he still suspects them every step of the way and even was even willing to kill Ed to get what he wanted. The Dwarf in the Flask episode which gave the backstory on Johenheim will go down as one of the best episodes in the series. Excellent backstory! I was so glad to see Envy finally taken down. Scar and Dr. Marcoh working together to destroy his Philosopher's Stone was awesome and with all of the atrocities that Envy has done, it was about time that humanity got a little revenge.
I don't get why the Dwarf in the Flask keeps making Greeds since he actively works against him and he knows it, but I am glad that he does because he is a lot of fun to watch. Plus with Ling Yao's body being the construct for the Philosopher's Stone, having Yao fight from the inside adds a whole new dynamic to the homunculi which already makes that even more interesting. Then having him team up with Ed and get in a showdown with Pride the most terrifying of the Homunculi? Yeah, that was all awesome. Then as always, Colonel Mustang keeps getting himself backed into a corner but just when you think he's down for the count, he flips the script with an elaborate scheme and finds a way to come out on top. They have yet to interact, but I would love to see Mustang duke it out with Kimblee. It all builds up to a final stand to prevent the day of reckoning... 9/10
Part 5: (Episodes 53-64 ) The beginning episodes were frustrating. On the one hand, it has some super powerful moments and the story remains fascinating. And everything about the eclipse and the Father's quest to become the perfect being was awesome. But it becomes way too Shonen for its own good and it drives me nuts. And for the life of me, I can not understand why Mustang does not use his flames more. He could have mowed down the mannequin horde, burned the super-soldiers to a crisp along with the scientist, and hell, he had a shot at Bradley when he was talking. But he chose to fight hand-to-hand until it was too late in all of those scenarios. It was so annoying. But boy was that Envy scene super satisfying! I was so pissed when Edward stopped him.
The season picks up for the better once all five sacrifices were brought to the Homunculus Father and he initiated the summoning circle and tried to become a God. While it was peak Shonen levels of fighting, it was actually really interesting because of the cosmic horror aspects and because the tone went from goofy to super serious with a couple character deaths including Greed, my favorite Homunculus. And above all, the show was an epic journey and it was nice to be rewarded by having a satisfying ending. So overall, I think this season has some amazing highs and it was still entertaining, but the writing wasn't as great as the last three seasons.
8/10
Plot: It's the 20th century and alchemy, the study of deconstructing and reconstructing matter, is used by a select few who are able to master the art. The rule of alchemy states that you cannot create something out of nothing, so when one wishes to obtain something, something of equal value must be paid. When the Elric brothers try to perform a human transmutation to bring their mother back from the dead, the experiment goes horribly wrong and they are left deformed with Ed losing an arm and a leg and Al losing his entire body, and having his soul put into an armored suit. The show follows Ed who has gained renown as the ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" who is on a quest to find out a way to get his brother and himself their bodies back.
Visuals: A *Besides the show involving elemental users that can manipulate matter, I think the artwork (not necessarily the character designs) for Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Avatar the Last Airbender are similar as well as the humor. It's a very colorful world with fluid animation and fantastic fight sequences. And like Avatar, characters are easy to distinguish from each other due to their characteristics like the Ishvalan having red eyes, Alphonse being a giant suit of armor, Edward being short with a metal arm and leg, the central military donning blue uniforms, and each of the Homunculi having their own monstrous forms and powers and the alchemists themselves having their own specialties with how they cast their alchemy.
Voice Acting: B *As usual, I watched the dub and throughout the series, I've gotten used to the few voices that did annoy me at first. Al's voice is super cute and I love him. Ed's voice is fine... when he's not yelling about someone calling him short. But the gag and the yelling grew on me in time especially as the gag gets used a bit less as the show gets more serious. But Ed is far from the only character that screams and gets angry out of nowhere for trivial things for no reason. I'm looking at you Winry! The ""screaming for comedic effect"" anime trope turned me off in season 1, but the show gets so much better with each season afterward. And most of the voices are really good.
Film Score/Soundtrack: In the context of the show, I felt like the music does a good job of enhancing scenes and being memorable. The themes that repeat in particular are excellent at this and during the many emotional moments during the show, that's where the score shines. However, as a standalone listen, I find the score to be pretty boring to listen to. There are a bunch of songs I hear and I'm like ""oh I remember that, I like that one"" but there's no way I could sit through a lot of the atmosphere fillers.
***My favorite track: Look, this is 5 seasons worth of material, there is no way I can only choose 1 song ok?
Requiem for the Blind Alchemist
(I am partial to bells and pretty melodies ok? This is a gorgeous song!)
Lurking
(You hear this too many times an episode to not include this eerie track amongst the best. It is a powerful atmosphere setter which is heavily used when important plot points are being discussed by the characters. It's a short and sweet song, but very, very memorable because it lingers)
Postlude
(Ditto to my first comment. I love songs that have bells. Haunting melodic lullabies I find memorable and really pretty)
***I can't find this last track and it's driving me NUTS!!! It's the ""happy-sounding flute song"" that plays in most episodes which serves as sort of a theme for Ed and Alphonse. I've searched for a long time but I am unable to figure out what to call it. So frustrating!
Characters:
Colonel Mustang is the GOAT. Master strategist underdog that finds a way out of the muck. Plus his flame alchemy is super powerful and I hate how underutilized it is.
Ling Yao started as a funny comedic relief and evolved into one of the best characters in the show.
Alphonse has awesome armor and his personality is so pure and I loved him!
Edward is probably the most likable whiny protagonist I've seen in a show. I love his determination, but he could be a bit much at times. And much like Mustang, he relies too much on hand-to-hand combat when he's a skilled alchemist and it drives me nuts.
Scar is like the Prince Zuko (see Avatar the Last Airbender) of Fullmetall but far more ruthless. He fights with a vengeance and eventually learns that revenge isn't the way of making the world a better place. But that doesn't mean that he doesn't kill his fair share of people either.
Johenheim has an awesome backstory and much like Mustang, he is someone you can't count out because the show likes to make you think he's going to lose when in actuality, he apparently was playing chess the entire time while the Dwarf in the Flask was playing checkers.
Homunculi:
1: Greed *Badass personality and voice. He just had a really cool vibe and I love how much of a wildcard he is. And when he fused to Ling Yao, game over. He already made a good first impression in his limited time in seasons 1 and 2, but then he solidified himself as my favorite Homunculi and one of my favorite characters on the show. ""I want money, women, status, fame... and everything else in this world."" In the end, he actually wanted friendship
2: Envy *The evilest of the Homunculi that committed the most amount of atrocities. He was a mass manipulator because of his ability to shape-shift into any form that he wished to. And besides that, he has a sharp tongue and has fun turning people on each other. Yet he still could hold his own in a fight because of how many souls he consumed. Envy was a parasite and a monster. But eventually we discover that Envy was jealous of humanity and needed humans as a vessel to survive because he hated his own ugly form.
3: Pride *Out of all of the Homunculi, Pride was the one with the most frightening ability. I almost wish he didn't reveal his identity to Hawkeye because he could have remained a secret and continued to cause a lot of problems for our heroes without them even knowing who was attacking them. Pride was the only Homunculus to share his Father's form and I find it ironic that his original body was of a human despite the Father's resentment to humanity and his desire to ascend to a more perfect being. Also, I loved when Kimblee stepped in to ensure that Pride didn't take Ed's body. That was badass!
4: Wrath *A friend of mine was telling me about a Kung Fu RPG game called Jade Empire and how in the game you can get a gun from a sidequest and that you can use it to kill the final boss because guns > Kung Fu to which I replied: that isn't the case in anime. In the world of Fullmetal Alchemist, somehow not only is Wrath's sword mightier than the gun, but it is mightier than the tank too. It was a bit absurd, but at the same time, awesome to see how many people were required to bring Wrath down. And it was beautifully ironic that Wrath died peacefully with a smile on his face
5: Lust *She was an interesting opponent for the time she was in the show. And much like Envy, I enjoyed it a lot when Mustang was able to unleash his power. Manipulation was her game and she did a number on Havoc and made Mustang's life a living hell.
6/7: Glutonny/Sloth *I lump these two together because outside of their main traits, they don't really have that much personality. Gluttony was always hungry and Sloth hated existing. Both could always be outsmarted by the heroes or manipulated by their fellow homunculi. And because of this, I always saw these two as minor players.
Cringeworthy Anime Moments: For a show with a premise as dark as this one has, it sure has a lot of light-hearted humor. Sometimes I like it, but it was often cringe-inducing. The loud girl squealing because she sees something she loves stereotype or the main character repeatedly getting pissed off when someone makes a joke to him, or the unrealistic use of violence as a means of characters interacting with each other all irritated the hell out of me as I watched this. But it does get significantly better after season 1 and I've actually grown to enjoy the humor for the most part even if my eyes roll when it happens.
Opening Titles:
Opening 1 *is the GOAT! Classic anime opening that I doubt most people skipped. Super catchy and badass! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONlpjTnXlms)
Opening 2 *No offense to people that like this type of music, but it's not for me. Sounds too much like whiney emo rock. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqIahGU9ZtY)
Opening 3 *Not bad but looking back these intros a couple years later, I totally forgot that this existed and I have no urge to add this song to my anime playlist after relistening to it. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et7oxRRkPEo)
Opening 4 *Ditto with part 3. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMPUhjUmRI)
EndingTitles:
Ending 1 *Cute animation and melody. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHbUcpXypd8)
Ending 2 *Easily my favorite of the bunch. Super catchy chorus, lovely progression and great animation. In the never skipped once territory for me. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi9zgj8foKo)
Ending 3 *Hard to follow up ""Let It All Out"" but somehow the cute big-boobed Winry being mechanic with Japanese rap and Xiao-Mei looking cute playing with her panda holds up pretty well even though it is totally pandering with cute anime girls doing cute things. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ6Bp9E3OFA&ab_channel=1)
Ending 4 *Back to never skip status again. Super catchy rock song with a memorable chorus and flashy and exciting animation. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxkyElx0pXI)
Ending 5 *The type of song that tries to hit you in the feelz with the chord progression and the build-up to the catchy and powerful chorus. It hit its mark on me. Fitting for the final ending track. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hpfhV9SLx0&ab_channel=RinElric)
Final Verdict: 9/10 *Fullmetal Alchemist is a ridiculously entertaining show with an awesome premise filled with lots of likable characters, awesome action sequences, entertaining villains, and a satisfying conclusion. Even though I won't rank it as my favorite anime, I have no qualms with this being one of the highest rated and most beloved anime series of all time. I loved the ride that this show took me on.",9
"
                I put off watching this anime for a long time, despite all the high praise I heard about it, thinking that it would probably be overrated. And boy was I wrong. Very mild spoilers ahead so read at your own risk!
Story (10/10): I can definitely say that in my opinion, FMA:B deserves all the praise that it gets. The story is fantastic and moves at a good pace - with 64 episodes, it never felt like the story dragged on or was ever boring. There are some good twists and turns to keep you on your toes, and the fight scenes are great. I'll leave
                  it at that as to not spoil too much. 
Art (8.5/10): Compared to some of the newer shows, the animation still holds is own (Bones Studio comes through as per usual), but it is definitely not as polished as some anime from more recent years. They do a great job with the fight scenes, especially in the later half of the show 
Characters (10/10): Aside from the story, one of the most compelling things about this show are the characters. You truly grow to care for the Elric brothers and are rooting for them to get their bodies back and get a happy ending. Edward is probably my favorite shounen MC of all time, and it is so satisfying to see him grow (mentally and physically) and learn from his past mistakes.This show is also jam packed with amazing female characters, which is something that the shounen genre is sometimes lacking in. Winry, Riza, Izumi, and Olivier are all amazing (just to name a few). In addition, Greed and Scar are some of the best anti-heroes that I have come across in anime. There are really no one-dimensional characters in this show, and it truly allows FMA:B to shine. 
Enjoyment (10/10): To be honest, I have a hard time finishing shows as I get bored easily. Not once did I consider dropping FMA:B, since it kept me entertained throughout. Especially in the last 2 seasons, it was pretty hard to stop watching once everything that had been leading up to the Promised Day got set into motion.
I do want to talk about a few things that some people might dislike about the show:
1.) Again, the animation is good, IMO, but if you are used to watching anime from more recent years, it might look subpar.
2.) Some people have issues with the comedy in the show. Personally, I didn't have an issue with it, but I can definitely see why some people might. I will say that some of the jokes/running gags do drastically decrease after the first season or two, so if that is something that bothers you, keep in mind that it will not be as prevalent as the show goes on. 
3.) I think this is mostly for people who have seen the 2003 version first, but some people do find the first few episodes to be rushed. I watched FMA:B before reading the manga, and I didn't notice any pacing issues, but just thought I would point that out. 
Overall, FMA:B really is a 10/10 show for me. If you are putting off watching this like I did for a long time, GO WATCH IT! 
FMA:B weaves an amazing and philosophical story about family, war, revenge, love, and ultimately, humanity.",10
"
                After rewatching it again, it is still a damn masterpiece 
I cried, laugh, and enjoyed it.
I still can’t believe that this was made in 2009, the animation in the fight scenes were so smooth and fantastic. The blending of funny, sad, and hype in this is so well. The story is very unique, the morals being taught was done well.
The characters are so well written that even you would feel sympathy with the side characters that you’ve only seen 2-3 episodes.
This is still the best of all shounen animes out there.
Berserk and FmaB really deserves to be the best seinen and shounen or even the
                  top.
Every episode is just a masterpiece, The voice acting is magnificent thanks to the talented seiyuus that are here. A 2009 anime beating the latest shounens with this kind of animation, really hilarious, thanks Studio bones for this wonderful adaptation and also thank you for the wonderful story, mangaka <3
And also one thing that makes this even better is how human every characters are in this anime.",10

                Summary:
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a fantastic show with an engaging plot and interesting characters. This is for good reason. This is one of the best anime to watch if you have never watched one before. Its overall quality is superb, although it is not a masterpiece. The suspense will keep you invested, and it’s awesome that you can now binge-watch it. I recommend it to anyone interested in trying a new show or getting into anime.
Story: 9/10
Unlike many anime with the same genre, FA:B is not overly plot-driven. The characters develop over time and make choices that coincide with the plot. This is an important
                  aspect of any good story. The viewer gets to know the main characters based on their traumatic past and their goals to reverse the mistakes they’ve made. The world-building is excellent, and watching this from start to finish makes you feel as though the characters’ world isn’t just a fantasy world. 
Art: 9/10
The art is beautiful 90% of the time. There are some scenes where it seems like there are missing frames, but the overall art quality is amazing.
Sound: 10/10
The soundtrack, openings, and endings are absolutely the best part of this anime. If MAL ranked anime based on these categories, FA:B would probably listed #1 for sound alone. Even the voice acting is great, and that can be hard to find in English dubbed anime.
Character: 8/10
Compared with many anime, this show has well-written characters who gradually develop over time. Ed’s face literally gets bigger and more mature as he grows older. Some characters seem to lack depth while many are quite life-like. Overall, the characters help to depict the themes throughout the story.
Enjoyment: 10/10
This is absolutely one of my favorite anime because of its overall quality and how enjoyable it is. It keeps you wanting more until the very end. The ending is also beautiful.
Overall: 9.2/10",9
"
                I loved the series. I laughed with it. I cried like a baby, especially whenever Ed shows his selfless nii-san love for Al. I was intrigued with every ending of the episode, which was one of the reasons I finished the whole thing in a week. The series was not a disappointment in my part, and it made me wish that all of the other remakes would be AS GOOD as this. This is a quick recommend to my friends who love to watch shounen and for those who were familiar with the original FMA, because Brotherhood was told in the manga's point of view,
                  and the story came in full circle in the end.",10
"
                Full metal alchemist Brotherhood was one of the first anime i watched and i am sure the same can be said for many others, I believe the reason for this is not purely based off of the fact that it is very popular but also because it is a great starter/beginner anime. The reason i think this is thanks to the shows inclusion of everything that makes anime what it is (music,animation the works) and the fact that the anime isn't missing anything crucial like some other anime shows is a testament as to how much care was weaved during production. What i am trying
                  to say is the show does everything well and in my humble opinion has no glaring flaws aside from the fact that while it does everything well it doesn't go above and beyond in any aspect so in retrospect it has no glaring negatives but also no glaring positives, it is simply put a tightly made show, a jack of all trades if you will these facts combined make it very appetising for newcomers. 
Now don't hate me for this but i do think the show is slightly overrated. Majority of people who watch this show watch it as one of their first anime due to it being recommended to them through various means and because it is so balanced overall (as mentioned) people hail it after the first watch and that is because they don't really have anything to compare it to. Now i'm 100 percent sure that there are people who have seen the show after seeing many others and still give it a shining star of a rating and that is fine everyone is entitled to their opinions this review is just my opinions on the matter.  
If you want to describe full metal alchemist in one sentence it would either be : the perfect starting/beginner anime (death note is up there as well) or one of the most balanced and tightly made anime.  
I feel there is no need to go deeper into an analysis as if you have not seen the show watch it because the show has everything while also having no major flaws. As i have mentioned countless times (sorry) it is a great beginner anime for those reasons, but just because its a good starter anime does not mean you shouldn't watch it if you are not new to the anime scene as its an absolute joy to watch from start to finish thanks to it being a great quality show all the way through. 
Its an anime that sets the standard for other anime for a reason. A must watch.",8
"
                Brotherhood is an amazing show. Although I like the 2003 adaptation better, I think that Brotherhood still deserves the hype that it gets. 
STORY:
The story is a refreshing and entertaining adventure that never ceases to impress. The knowledge and mystery that goes on in this show mixed in with its own unique philosophy make this show supposedly one of a kind. The first 12 episodes start off a bit rushed, this is only because the author created it assuming everybody watching had already been familiar with the manga or have watched the 2003 series. The rest is solely based on opinion, I think that it's
                  good but it also turns into a typical shonen near the end of the series. FMA 2003 is more of a darker-seinen type of show that doesn't fall into the horror genre but isn't happy-go-lucky at the same time. I recommend you watch both shows.
CHARACTERS: The Elric brothers are an amazing dynamic along with a lot of the other characters in the show. Each of them barring their own hardships that affect their decisions and how they act and or view the world. The characters in this show are pretty good and they give the show a good atmosphere.
ART: Stunning, crisp, great quality, enough said.
ENJOYMENT:
Fullmetal Alchemist will always hold a spot in my top 10 anime and I will always re watch yearly, it most definitely deserves the ratings it gets I think everybody should watch it when they get the chance. I enjoyed it a lot.",8

                No spoilers
A very nice anime. Excellent in every aspect. 
I have watched it three times. 
The plot twists are especially entertaining. 
The animation quality is also great.
 The character development is exciting.
 It's much better than the original.
 The openings are magnificent and extremely memorable. 
It's worth it to watch all 64 episodes and the ending is especially satisfying as no plot holes remain. 
The relationships between characters can get confusing at times but overall adds to the plot.This show is definitely a 10/10 and deserves to be watched by everyone who considers themselves an anime enthusiast
Although it's true that the plot can get slow at times, this is a common theme in any large anime. This also provides a much-needed break for viewers.
Overall an excellent anime, I would recommend to a friend.",10
"
                I really really loved this anime, its a masterpiece and a really good entry for non anime viewers, however I personally think that the opening episodes are weak compared to the rest of the show, the humor is not very good (it's not THAT bad just used poorly), and has some very awkward tone shifts, despite all of my gripes and criticisms, it's still great and I highly recommend it. 
Edward Elric is one of my favorite characters of all time, his development is so great, its such a great story about tragedy and becoming stronger by learning from your mistakes, he's also a very
                  flawed person, who has trouble compromising and changing, and feels entitled to certain things, but his flaws are understandable because of what he's been through as a child, not to mention he's still a young adult, and despite all his flaws he's able to move forward and improve both himself as person, and also the world for the better. I also love his design, and personality.
I also love other characters like Ling Yao, Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Alphonse Elric, Greed and others.",9
"
                Okay so there's so many awesome things about this show. I'll start with my favorite thing about the show. The female characters are written so well. They have their own desires and motivations throughout the show. They're really awesome and just as important as other male characters. Many of the side characters also have a lot of really cool aspects to them. There are very few characters who seem flat. There's just a lot of attention paid to everyone in the show and I enjoy it. 
The use of a power system like alchemy is also very unique to the show and I enjoy seeing
                  how Alchemy is used in inventive ways throughout the show. It's also the main means for others in the show to create conflict (and then resolve the conflict) It's a cool magical system without being ""magical""",9

Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood is a highly acclaimed show that i started years ago but i couldnt finish it cuz of the slow start , but all my friends who have watched it gave it 10s , so i decided to give it a second chance and finish it , here is my brutally honest review about it .
Story 7:
The main story line is fairy simple ,it tells the tale of  2 brothers trying to get their bodies back after committing a taboo (trying to revive their dead mother) , this premise is very good and effective plus its unique among the i wanna be
                  the very best overused formula of other battle shonens , but sadly i didnt get as invested in this particular premise cuz of hte 2 main characters but i will leave the reasons  for later .The sub plots are what carried the show for me , scar's revenge , the corruption of the military and the seven sins's objective...etc , are all excellent sub plots that made me finish the anime . the show also tackles some very deep and interesting topics and themes , from religion to the morality of science . to racism and corruption and evem exsitentialism , the show is one of deepest shonens out there with the greastest of ease . But sadly it suffers from a very big problem imo , the freaking comedy and especially in the first half , not only its repetetive and unfunny ,but also used in a lot of serious moments and mid fights which breaks the tone and makes me furious , this is a problem you find in low tier shonens like fairy tail and dr stone we dont need that here . The final arc is one of the best climaxes of a story ive seen in anime in term of fights , and sheer numbers of characters present , and the big majority of them played a big role in the narrative which is something rare to see , but on the other hand the ending felt forcibly happy i would  ve prefered if the author had given us a more bitterswet finale with more deaths and heavier prices to pay . Another thing to note is that , i ve wanted to see more about xing empire maybe an arc about it , or the agenda of the old military geezer who i was expecting to pull a plot twist on us . Also to finish this paragraph there was some plot convinience in the mix but its not a big problem by this point.
Art and animation 9/10
Very consistent through all the 64 eps run , with some animated scenes of mind blowing sakuga in the final arc , sasuga studio bones 
Characters 7/10
Its time to address the elefant in the room , the freaking main characters , the mc edward (and this might be a little bit harsh)  is one of the worst protagonists i ve seen in an anime  , not only he is the source of the comedy i hate so much in the show , but he a goody goody too shoes with naive ideals that survives to the end of the story just becuz the villains need him to be alive so they can complete their master plan  , he also has this atheist ideaology going for him which i wont dwelve into . His brother is a little bit better than him , but he is  in the majority of the times a dumbass , a beta male with a body of a hulk but the brain of a bird.Tehir childhood friend wnery , is a character that i didnt care about at the first half , but i ve come to appreciateher after her developpement . Other characters carried the show like : mustang , scar , greed , ran fan , lin and others , they are so many good characters you will have at least 2 or 3 of them that you like .T wasted character imo is king bradely who had the potential to be the best character in the show , but i wasnt a fan of the way the author handeled him , the same can be said about mustang and his revenge  . the final character that i need to talk about is the main villain , the dwarf in the flask , the concept behind him was very deep and interesting(him wanting to be free from the flask at first then becoming greedier and greedier wanting to surpass humanity ) but overall i think he was lacking as a final villain , he is cartoonishly evil and his masterplan that btw could ve been stopped with greatest of ease if the main characters used their small brains , was kinda underwhelming and even generic . 
Sound 9/10
Excellent , opening 2 , 3, 4 ,5 are all great , the soundtracks are varried from sadness , to hype to dread , it music i can evoque every emotion possible from you .
Enjoyement 7/10
Despite the high expectations i entered this show with , i would say for the most part it paid of,  it had some pacing issues in the beggining and the middle , there was one episode about a random women giving birth that i feel it could ve been removed too .
Overall 7/10
In conclusion , full metal alchemist brotherhood is a very deep show , its not perfect by any means , but at the same time its very solid , is it the best anime of all time ? Hell no . Is it the best battle shonen out there ? Its not my fav personally but i can see why it is so praised . The exact score that i calculated is 7,8/10",7

                (Sorry for my bad english, I'm brazilian and I used the google tranlate)
English: Okay, this anime is amazing, considering this, I'll separate by topics first:
Sound:
Well, I confess that I don’t have enough property to talk about it, since I didn’t pay attention to them, because for me, every anime should have a good sound, of course it’s not the case for everyone * cof * One punch man 2 * cof *, but, I'm going to talk about the anime songs, first of all the Openings, which obviously are all wonderful. Dude, it's hard for an anime to get me to watch all the Ops,
                  but this one did, but the most impressive thing is that besides the songs being impressively good, the ""clip"" itself is wonderful, it has great meaning for the entire anime.
History:
Well, this story is crazy, that to say, not as much as other anime, but certainly it is, and this is not a bad thing, and the ""crazy"" I mean is in relation to its complexity, and the plot twist that history itself has it. And the narrative rhythm of the story is very good, I confess that one thing that distanced me from this anime for a long 6 months, was mainly due to comments saying that the beginning of the series is bad, but, at least in my lay opinion, the beginning is very well, and it made me curious about how the anime was going to go from there. Of course, I didn't watch the classic, nor did I read the manga, but in my opinion I liked it.
Character:
Well, what about the characters? Maybe we can talk about how amazing they are. They are charismatic, funny, fun to follow, with good developments for most of them. And surprisingly few characters are irritating, and those that are, are not irritating irritants, they are interesting irritants, well, I think I can give an example: [Spoiler from the beginning] Scar in the beginning, he is irritating, because he only killed the federals without you knowing why, he was annoying for killing for no reason (until that moment) [end of spoiler] but interesting because you know he's not just a loose character, bringing you more and more curiosity, until you find out his plot, and boom, becomes one of the best characters. For me, this type of development is one of the best.
Finishing:
Well, you can clearly see that I liked it, but for me, it's not the best anime in the world. Of course, it is a very good anime, with magnificent action scenes and captivating characters, but something is missing, which is in other animes that I will comment on, I don’t know exactly what it is, but it’s missing, so I put 9, for is an incredible anime, but not a masterpiece at all.
Português: Ok, esse anime é incrível, considerando isso, eu vou separar por tópicos primeiro:
Som:
Bom, confesso que não tenho a propriedade o suficiente para falar sobre isso, já que eu não prestei a atenção neles, por que pra mim, todo anime devia ter uma boa sonorização, claro que não é o caso de todos *cof* One punch man 2 *cof*, mas, vou falar sobre as musicas do anime, primeiramente as Openings que obviamente todas são maravilhosas. Cara, é difícil um anime conseguir me prender a assistir todas as Ops, mas esse conseguiu, mas o mais impressionante, é que além das musicas serem impressionalmente boas, o ""clip"" em si é maravilhoso, tem um ótimo significado pro anime inteiro.
História: 
Bom, essa historia é maluca, que dizer, não tanto quanto outros animes, mmas com certeza é, e isso não é algo ruim, e o ""maluca"" que quero dizer é em relação a complexidade dela, e o tanto de plot twist que a própria historia tem. E o ritmo narrativo da historia é muito bom, confesso que uma coisa que me distânciou desse anime por longos 6 meses, foi principalmente por comentários dizendo que o começo da serie é ruim, mas, pelo menos na minha leiga opinião, o começo é muito bom, e me deixava curioso sobre como o anime ia seguir dali pra frente. Claro que eu não assisti o clássico, e nem li o manga, mas, na minha opinião eu gostei. 
Personagem: 
Bom, o que falar dos personagens? Talvez podemos falar sobre como eles são incríveis. Eles são carísmaticos, engraçados, divertidos de se acompanhar, com um bom desenvolvimentos para a maiorias deles. E surpreendente poucos personagens são irritantes, e os que são, não são irritantes irritantes, são irritantes interessantes, bom, acho que posso dar um exemplo: [Spoiler do começo]O Scar no começo, ele é irritante, por que ele só matava os federais sem você saber o por que, ele era irritante por matar sem motivo (até aquele momento) [fim do spoiler] mas interessante porque você sabe que ele não é só um personagem solto, te trazendo mais e mais a curiosidade, até você descobrir o plot dele, e boom, se torna um dos melhores personagens. Pra mim esse tipo de desenvolvimento é um dos melhores.
Finalização:
Bom, dá pra perceber claramente que eu gostei, mas, para mim, não é o melhor anime do mundo. Claro, que é um anime muito bom, com cenas de ação magnificas e com personagens cativantes, só que falta algo, que tem em outros animes que vou comentar, não sei exatamente o que é, mas, falta, por isso botei 9, por é um anime incrivel, mas não masterpiece de todos os tempo.",9
"
                I was introduced to this anime by my brother because you could say five years ago I often watched anime with him and finally I came back again last year after not watching anime for a long time. At that time I was watching a lot of anime in one week, so maybe I was dizzy when I was recommended the anime fullmetal alchemist. So when I watched it ... I got bored right away in the first episode. And I went back to watching it again four days ago.
And I swear if I could rate this anime up to 100, I would. This anime
                  is definitely my favorite anime. Why? because the storyline is not boring 
This anime provides comedy that can be said to be funny and not made up. There are so many anime these days that the element of comedy is only screaming and getting angry (it is a type of comedy that is cringe-worthy).
Lessons about kinship and friendship are found here too, and when i watch this anime, and when I watched this anime, when I watched episode one for the first time I thought that this anime had no sad part ... and it turned out that there was sadness too
So when there is a sad part of the story ... I always cry. Because it is very sad, super sad.
And maybe if you watch it, you might feel guilty
For the things that I don't like in this anime, there are lots of good characters who die. Hahahaha and I would prefer it more if there were mei and alphonse parts to meet in xing.
Akhhhh I hope the episodes are up to a hundred !!!!",10

                (first of all, I'm sorry about my english, I know it sucks but not everyone came from America or England)
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, what a awesome tale. This anime can be considered a masterpiece.
Story: 10
Hiromu Arakawa is a genius. The story is so complex but its tell so well that is rare the thing you don't understand, the 64 episodes help tell the story piece by piece and all comes together perfectly. In the beiggining I thought that the story was basicly them after the philosofer stone, but this show that it's not that simple and when you start putting the pieces together you will see
                  how great this story is.
Art: 9
The art was pretty good, it was detailed in certain moments and was as simple as it could depend on the situation. There is not much to say about this topic, I mean it wasn't the most beatifull anime ever but it was far away from being ugly.
Sound: 10
The sound is awesome. The openings and endings are some of the best I've ever heard (and the visuals of them are awesome aswell) and it make me go to youtube just to watch and listen the openings and endings. The sound track was great aswell and maid us fell the moment
Character: 10
The characters are so well develop, you can see everyone's motivation o why they are doing what they are doing and they tell us in many diffrent ways everybody's past and they tell us that many times, each time with difrent details that have to do with what's happening.
Enjoyment: 10
I just could resit to this show and made it more important to me than every other thing, it's just great
Overall this showis a complete masterpiece that everyone can enjoy and I recomend it to everybody, including you that are reading this.
This show is a solid 10/10 the greatest anime ever.",10
"
                I was definitely late in watching Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, and even more late in writing a review because I finished the anime over 2 months ago. In addition, I actually finished the original Fullmetal Alchemist today. But despite my wrong order and lateness, I only have one thing to say about the show. 
Outstanding. 
I was very hesitant about watching Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood because I was worried of not understanding the storyline or not being fond of the characters and animation, but I'm glad I decided against it. 
I won't spoil either of them, but they are indeed very different stories and I overall prefer
                  Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. 
The pace is definitely much better, the story fits together beautifully, and the events that occur are much more...preferable and enjoyable to say the least. This anime had about every good aspect that I could think for an anime to have. A good story, amazing characters, humor, sad moments, and moments that make you think. 
I usually adore any anime that involves a relationship between a family, and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood definitely takes the cake for that in the struggles and obstacles Ed and Al face to triumph in the end.
It was a great watch and I highly recommend it, especially if you're someone like me who's hesitant about starting an anime with the unique background this one contains. Its worth it.",10
"
                Brotherhood has the strength to appeal to the masses, which is why I believe it is a very strong anime. Whether you are just starting down the path to watching anime, or if you've been an avid watcher for years, this series still has the potential to reel you in. 
Every aspect of this show is pretty solid, especially the art, the story, and the characters. Some characters are not as likeable as others, but there's a nice ratio. The music was OKAY, as most tracks sounded pretty 'generic'. There's a few dull moments here and there (as with MANY other shows), but there are
                  also some great moments too. Brotherhood could be described as the perfect ""mid."" A very average show, but the best average show out there, which is why I think it has one of the biggest fan bases out there. Do I believe it deserves the highest rating on MAL (as of 1/23/2021)? Sure, why not?
I would like to point out that the anime came out in 2009! And compared to a lot of shows that came out during that time, this assuredly stands the test of time. 
This is also 100x better than the original series in my opinion, and the ending is much more fitting.",8
"
                FMA brotherhood is great, In my opinion I would prefer FMA brotherhood than FMA. FMA brotherhood's story is imaginative and and has a great plot, The characters are memorable and it has great animation and good fights. The ending is perfect and i can see why this is the highest rated anime. 
A lot of people say this show is over rated, but i would say no because FMA brotherhood doesn't seem relevant now a days. FMA brotherhood is a great anime to start with and it has a great philosophy of nothing can be achieved without sacrificing something else in return.

                My first review:
I dropped it but then rewatched it. The beginning is a little rushed (relations mainly) and not very good. And I found the action VERY weak, it had a maximum of 15 seconds of good animation every 20 ep. I mean really good, fluid, well choreographed and exciting. Okay, it gets exciting but, only because of the great direction. The real bad thing about it was the 'cuts' of a bunch of fights just to don't animate them, there were times when the camera just turned around, to someone who was watching (for example) and then turned back to the guys fighting and
                  the fight was over. There must have been a lack of funds. I saw so many people making a great deal out of it, when it wasn't. That's all I have to complain about. The rest is really good. The characters are very good and well developed (like 90% of the cast), the comedy was good, the music, the alchemy (what a well thought thing), the drama, the brilliant story, but it's all thanks to the EXCELLENT script, my god.",8
"
                I am still quite new to anime in the sense I've watched more mainstream types, however, FMA:B is one of the best anime I have come across. I think what really sells the story is the rich character development as well as motive. When you look at different types of shounen, it's all reaching for the top. I do like those kinds of animes, however, it gives a different and warm feeling when watching this show. The family bond is one of the most important driving forces in this anime which the creators keep consistent. The only mark that was lacking was the art/animation style
                  since with the anime now lacks compared to most. (demon slayer lol) But, at the time of release (2009), this was one of the greatest. Sound is great, love the music. Love all the characters. Not as tear-jerky, but I do consider it pretty emotional. Any new anime watchers NEED to see this masterpiece. Probably one of the only 10s I consider giving out.",10
"
                I absolutely loved this series. I felt that character development was great, and I felt like I was truly a part of the story line. All of the characters brought about some sort of emotion, whether it was love or hate, or anything in between. There was everything you could imagine; action, mystery, romance, comedy, you name it. It was beautifully animated and there's not really any negatives that I see. I've not yet read the manga or fully watched the earlier series, but I completely loved Brotherhood.
              ",10

                Mayhaps the most spacious of Anime I have deemed to witness which is my assertion indeed.
 The story is based upon the magical fairytaleland of Assermitus ruled by the dear and beloved leader, going by the nominated name and illustrious title of King Fuhrer Bradley. As a fellow Aryan this touches and affects my very soul to have further representation and presentation from the Nipponese (The japanese word for Japan), which I am quite fond of.
The artstyle is virtuous and benevolent, a proposition of the Nipponese studio which fell kindly upon my ear, alas the age of the Anime lingers upon it which I dare
                  say must drag my critique and my steep and advantageous critique of the series which I have watched into submission. Hence, I must cede that the sequence I have evaluated must only acquire a ""good"" rating.
The sound quality was outstanding! As the Anime is one of the few English-speaking animes I had no problem or difficulty understanding and acquire the tactile property of the Anime. Therefore I must dare say that the sound and production quality of this Kinoesque masterpiece is of the highest quality. I am consequently obliged to give it a perfect 10/10 outstanding rating.
The characters were very good, as an aging man myself I must feel the need to point out how relatable the concept of age and of aging is. Perchance this was a meaningful choice and an existentialist motivator from the studio? We might never know, truly.
My enjoyment of the series was indeed quite to the contrary of the worse. For who are we but men and women pushing on, to fullfill our enjoyment? Yes. These are the questions one must ask of themselves as they retell their own prospect of this outstanding masterpiece classified as art, indeed.
Thus my review has concluded as an overall great review with a few flaws from the Nipponese studio which calls itself Anime.

                My biggest problem with this show is its start, which is why I gave it 9/10 on the story because the intro doesn't really flesh out the characters because they assume you already know everything because of the original series, but this leaves the original having a great intro and this one having a really lackluster start. The soundtrack is pretty good but its hardly above average for me. The action sequences are amazing and the characters are fleshed out. The story is phenomenal as well, every scene has a purpose and the mysteries continue to fold and never really stop. This show is anything
                  but boring.",10

                I was someone who watched the 2003 FMA and considered it to be the best anime I'd seen even though I hadn't seen a lot of anime's at the time. I had only heard of Brotherhood from the top 10 best anime of all time lists that I watched for recommendations. When I realised that Brotherhood was an authentic adaptation of the manga I bought it on Blu-ray and was completely blown away by how different (and better) it was to the 2003 version. 
Brotherhood is just a perfect all round show. Everything from the story, worldbuilding, characters and action just work together to create
                  something that is flawless. FMA:B isn't a show where the Story or Characters or Animation is the highlight of the show. Everything that is needed in a show is done to near perfection. 
The way it builds one of the greatest stories, worlds and characters in just 64 episodes is simply incredible. There's nothing more I can say about this anime because everyone's heard how great it is but it is truly one of if not the greatest anime's of all time.",10
"
                A story about two brothers overcoming their greatest past mistake from childhood, they learn the harsh reality of fair trading with the supernatural, or in the case of what the anime itself calls it, ""the law of equivalent exchange"", and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood makes this message perfectly clear all throughout. It masters many elements of the story it tries to convey, from fleshly developed characters, dynamic battle sequences, and the setting of the world these characters inhabit. It is all shown without feeling too fillerish or forced as well. This is an anime that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a shonen of top
                  quality, there is a reason why people say this is the best anime of all time. I just might agree with them, though I can't say for certain as I have a tough time deciding whether this is my favorite anime series or ""One Piece"" (And that is still ongoing).
With all that said, this anime is not perfect, sometimes the comedy while mostly good, can be a bit forced, certain jokes can be showcased during moments that don't call for them, whether it is directly after a very serious conversation or a very serious fight. I'm all for a good laugh but it's best to keep your comical moments far away from the very emotional scenes and they can appear very abruptly too. Thankfully, this doesn't happen too often and most of the comedy (while not the series' strongest point) is relatively good. Also another problem is the tiny handful of characters that annoyed me, like Mei Chang and Olivier Armstrong, this is merely just a nitpick as they aren't necessarily bad characters, just not well developed characters that I've grown to respect compared to a lot of others that are way better.
With all that said, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a beautifully crafted story with moments of sadness, fear, excitement and happiness all blended together to form one of the best anime of all time that will stand the test of time and live on in anime history as a testament on what makes a good anime. To end this on a metaphorical note, ""Human life is short lived and time is precious to every single person on this planet, but the sacrifice of watching all 64 episodes / 1408 minutes / 23 hours of this series is most certainly worth the time I gave away, I'd say that it's a fair equivalent exchange. :D",10

                This is an astounding anime - heres why. the story starts off slowly, but as characters develop throughout the story, it blooms into this masterpiece of an anime. Theres many twists, revelations, and fun times in this anime. It's funny when it needs to be, and in other times it's intense or sad. The music is by far the best I've heard from any anime to date and I still listen to it often. 
Story - 10 (My second favorite story in any anime I've watched)
Art - 10 (The music is really good)

Characters - 10 (Got
                  super attached and they develop beautifully)

Overall - 10 (Close to being my favorite anime and an amazing story!)
PLEASE WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE",10
"
                First of all I can definitely see why it's a lot of people's favorite anime. There's a reason why it's ranked so high. It also has some of the deepest feels in anime history. It's a different kind of feel than the psychological things that darker anime can throw at you. It's a simpler kind of feel. Although this show is about alchemy, it's very relatable. This show will make you want to hug your parents and siblings. This show just gives you raw emotion. There's nothing really to think about. Everybody knows what it's like to lose something that they love.
Story: 10
Our amazing main
                  character, Edward Elric, loses his left leg when trying to perform human transmutation to resurrect his mother. His brother's body disappears completely, so Ed sacrifices his right arm to bind his brother's soul to a suit of armor, making him a golem. His brother can't enjoy the simple things of life like eating. So they both go on an adventure to get their bodies back. I wanted to phrase the plot of the show in my own way, because I just want to emphasize how deep this show actually is. It will most likely make you cry. They really couldn't have made the story any better. So much thought and emotion was thrown into this anime. This anime is also the perfect length.
Art: 10
Very pretty animation. Definitely deserves a 10. I HAVE seen better, but that doesn't mean that this animation style and quality deserve anything less than a 10. I can only say good things about it.
Sound: 10
Going off of the feels of the overwhelmingly deep plot, we have the haunting chorus from ""Lapis Philosophorum"" and all of its forms. Also, this anime has 5 intros and outros, and THEY ARE ALL GOOD! It's really rare for that to happen. This soundtrack is perfect. Just as much time went into it as with everything else. That is apparent.
Character: 10
Okay, as good as EVERYTHING about this anime is, this is probably the best part. The characters are incredible. All of them. They are all deep and all have fantastic backstories. If they don't make you cry, I don't know what will. The main villain is really cool, too. Definitely in my top 10 villain list. I can't say ANYTHING bad about them, and I don't want to say any spoilers. So I think that I'll leave it at that. Also, there are some biblical references in some of the characters, which is interesting whether one is religious or not.
Enjoyment: 10
What's not to enjoy about this anime? I was so sad when it ended. I'm usually really critical about things, and I would critique it if I could. The ONLY thing I could nitpick is one thing during the end, and that's how a couple of our main characters handled a particular death, but I'm not going to spoil anything. But that's it, and that's me really looking for something to complain about.
Over: 10
Obviously I'm going to give this a 10. There are 10s across the board. I'm going to have to rewatch this anime with my dad, since he likes the anime that I show him. Anyway, this anime will always be close to my heart.",10

                There isn't much more I could say with all the praise it already has, but I truly believe that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood deserves every bit of it.
The pacing is phenomenal; filler is minimal to nonexistent and every episode serves as another step forward. I know a few people who thought that the first few episodes were not explanatory enough, but one of the great things about it is its lack of unnecessarily long narratives; it gives you just enough background information without petulantly walking you through it.
FMAB is also one of the only anime that I prefer the dubbed version over the subbed. The voice
                  actors are fit fantastically in their roles, and the openings and endings were, for the most part, great. The animation was gorgeous as well, especially in action shots.
But I think the most important thing to be taken into account is the plot and characters. At its center, FMAB is about two brothers who have just enough flaws for you to emotionally connect with them, but not so many that it crosses the boundary into overly annoying. The length (64 episodes) allows for steady character development, whether it be for the better or worse. Even the villains have some sort of depth without making it seem like a rushed pity backstory. It can sometimes have crass humor (which serves surprisingly well as comic relief), but it is also harshly realistic; good people die and there isn't always a good reason for it.

So go watch it! I hope you'll love it as much as I do.",10

                I don't know how to word this out without sounding too biased, but here we go. First of all, I have not seen the original, 'Fullmetal Alchemist'. Now, this review is simply based on my own opinion and preferences.
STORY: 9
The basic plot is great, outstanding, even. It's about 2 boys who committed a 'taboo' and their journey to getting back their bodies. 
ART: 7
The art is great however, I'm not much of a fan with 'childish' or rather, some characters look like teens and not their own age.
SOUND: 10
Absolutely amazing. That is all, one of the few anime in which I never skipped the opening.
                  Soundtracks, background music, definitely adding to my playlist.
CHARACTER: 5
The characters are basically pawns or a 'plot' rather than a character. I mean, they are treated as a plot. I don't see much character development and if there were opportunities to, the character overcomes the problem and they learn close to nothing. Or at the very least, it isn't shown on their actions that they learned something at all.
ENJOYMENT: 7
Unlike other anime, there were definitely times in FMAB that made me distracted. I would often quit the site I was watching the anime and begin starting other anime, but it's more a 'me' problem.
OVERALL: 8
I mean, it's too far of a stretch to call it 'the greatest anime of all time' but I can't deny that it was a pretty good anime. Would recommend watching.",8
"
                When compared to the first fma, it's more funny than dark, it has a lighter kind of humor and still remains serious. In a world of equivalent exchange we all know we've gotta give things up in order to gain things. Just like how I'm giving up time I could use for more productive things but I'm writing this review. Or how you'll give up all your time watching this awesome anime. The characters are great, there are many funny situations, and the animation is great along with the animation. The plot is wonderful and there isn't a boring moment in this show, there is
                  also a lack of fillers so the awesome keeps on coming.",9
"
                Context:
This was one of the first shows I watched, so I am naturally gonna be biased a bit positive throughout this, do keep that in mind.
Story:
FMA:B is a relatively simple story, a classic adventure plot, with a bit of mystery thrown in (albeit one that resolves itself long before the show ends). However, what it lacks in insane depth and complexity, it makes up for in execution. Every single plot thread that gets brought up, pays off, most of them even coming in right to the end of the 64-episode run. No scene feels wasted, but equally, you don't have to be keeping notes of
                  every little event just to understand what's going on. It finds the sweet spot for flashing back, where it does it enough to remind you of what you need to know, but not so much as to become annoying. 
Art:
Visually this show is perfectly passable. Nothing ever looks particularly terrible in motion, save a few moments where they get a bit...pain. But equally nothing is ever particularly jaw droppingly pretty. Equally, it being a show from 2009, it has a few attempts of what look like CG. They're again, mostly ok, but do occasionally grate a bit. The art does not ever detract from the rest of the show however, which is the most important part.
Sound:
First and foremost, this soundtrack is a gift from God. Akira Senju knocked it out of the park with this piece of work. The sound effects are, as all good sound work is, unnoticeable, with one glaring exception. There's one instant where for reasons unbeknownst to man or god, all ambiance cuts out to have a man sipping tea in total silence. And the dub (yes, yes, hang draw and quarter me for watching dubs) is wonderful with all the actors giving top tier performances. 
Characters:
This is again an area where FMA shines through. It has a wide cast of characters, and yet each and every one of them feels deep, developed, and for use of a better word, alive. Even those who turn up only briefly, like General Grumman, have well fleshed out personalities. It's one of the few shows where nearly every death, for heroes and villains alike, brings a tear to my eye.
Enjoyment:
Yeah, this show is fun, in case you hadn't got that already. It can bounce seamlessly between laugh-out-loud comedy, brutally enticing action scenes and heartwrenching emotional moments, and everyone already knows this. It's a show that I'd heartily recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it, and even those who have should give it a re-watch. 
Overall: 
FMA: Brotherhood is one of my favourite shows, one that I keep coming back to, and one that inspired me to actually make an account on this site, to start cataloguing and see if I can't find a show as good as it. Watch it if you haven't, watch it again if you have.

                This is the most deserved anime to be described as a masterpiece i have ever watched . every piece of it is a master and the overall is a master of pieces . action ,drama ,comedy ,tragedy , military ,history , adventure, philosophy , fantsy even romance all together . a story about family and brotherhood , a story about friendship and a great story about humans . 
Every aspect of the work  is amazing : The art ,the motion , the sounds , every single charcter in the anime and how it has its specific , identical role in the story , even
                  the songs of opennings and endings and their words which are suitable for the story and the arcs . 
The journey of edward from someone who sees alchemy capaple of everything and the answer of everything to one who sacrifice this alchemy . his journey of questionning and finding answers , meeting people and changing principles , seeing how wide is the world and how many ideologies it has . 
the anime discuuss many thorny topics like scientism , human experiments  ,racism , politics , wars, humanity  and power misuse .how science without morals and principles can be terrifying . what makes a human a human ? if humans are only a form of energy why human experiments are forbiden ? why even with their seven sins they can become an amazing creatures . why they choose to sacrifice even they have the sin of greed ? and why they choose to protect ? 
By fighting theirselves , fighting their sins ,learning to love and trust , learning from their painful lessons and enduring the pain , they obtain their powerful and unmatched heart  A Fullmetal Heart .",10

                I finally got around to watching this anime and quite honestly I am glad that I did, despite the confusion between this anime and Full Metal Alchemist. 
I frequently find myself in a 'funk'. The kind where I set myself in a panic when I think about things such as death. I feel like after watching this, I am a bit more at peace about the topic of death. 
There are many lessons to be learned from this anime that I think many people  need to take the time to learn. The main one would be the consequences the come from revenge/hate. 
The story
                  itself was written well and I hope to read the manga soon to compare the anime. 
The artwork is still good for the air time (2009). I thought the sound work was great! Especially when it came to Alphonse Elric and his metallic voice.
Well worth the watch and I highly recommend to anyone who has not seen it yet.",9
"
                I rarely write reviews. In fact, this may even be my first. But I felt the need to say a bit about FMA: B. I neglected watching it for a while because I don't normally agree with the masses when depicting what makes a great anime. 
 I tried watching the first episode some time ago and it honestly bored me. I couldn't bring myself to keep watching it.  And now, I was running out of good anime to watch and decided I would finally go through it. 
 I can't say that I didn't enjoy it. But for so many people to claim
                  it to be the best or greatest anime ever, the only reason I can fathom that they would think so, is because they haven't really watched that much anime. Because it was far from being great in my mind. If anything it was really good at best. No better or worse than most anime I have watched.  It introduces so so many characters, many of which you never really get to learn a great deal about. The story however, was quite intriguing and did at least get a happy ending, which is more than what many anime get. Many other shows I've watched are lucky to get a second season, let alone a proper ending.
All that being said, I've watched hundreds of different shows, which may not be an immense amount to some people but even still, I likely wouldn't even have this in my top 20 favorites. It would be safely in the middle of the pack with the rest of the shows I rate an 8/10.  Good enough to keep me busy for a few days but not great enough for me to want to watch again.
So if you're bored and haven't seen it yet, then watch it. You'll probably enjoy it if you enjoy most anime.  But don't expect it to be the best thing created  since sliced bread.",8
"
                What  could  I  say  about  FMAB ? Well , it's  an  excellent anime  and definitively  one  of  the  best  anime  of  all  time , if  not   the best , with  all the  aspects  getting  at  least  an  8/10.
The  animation  is  beatiful  and fluid and  really  like  it . I  really  enjoy  its  sound  ,  although  it's  not  one  of  my
                  favorite  OST's.
The  charachters  are  funny and  I  love  their   development and evolution 
through the anime, know  when  to  be  serious  and not  joke  around , it  feels  
 ike  they  are  real  persons.
It's  really  enjoyable  most  of  the  time , but  I  was  kind  of  bored  in some 
of   the  last  episodes , despite  the  fact  that  I  adored  the  ending. 
Overall, simply fantastic and a must see!

                I finished watching this anime three years ago but up until now, I still enjoy watching it. It's an anime that totally changed my outlook on life. I believe many people were hit in the heart because of it. It's not like any anime out there. I'm not comparing okay? I'm simply saying that it's different, that it gives a different vibe. It balances everything. 
I really love this anime. Why? I don't know. It's just so perfect. I guess one thing I really like is that it  balances the romance part and the action part.
It's really awesome.

                If you plan to see Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood for the first time, be prepared to be horrified by the first episodes! It took me a long time to get used to the way things work. Many lives are taken, many shadows lurking and many sacrifices are made.
Between being immortal and having all the knowledge of God or being human, most people would choose the first option. But with Fullmetal, you'll find that even immortal beings would want to be human. Because there is nothing more precious than that, human being.
Every human life is extremely important, which is why human transmutation is impossible. What's more, one
                  of the basic things you'll learn about alchemy is that to have one thing, you have to sacrifice another. This is the equivalent exchange, and if you are smug you may lose your most precious possession.
Funny how I identified so much with the homunculi, human means representing the seven deadly sins, and I was so moved by them. Each farewell hurt my heart a lot. Even though they were horrible while alive, they also had feelings and suffered in silence.
I can't help but say that this anime filled with Plot Twists, with characters that initially make you angry, and then you will have an inexplicable affection for them - as well as vice versa. The fact is that some have the opportunity to start over, but not everyone is so lucky.
I confess that at first the atheistic thought of Edward Elric the protagonist bothered me a great deal. It seems that he thought himself on the same level as God. But over time, his maturity surprised me too much!
One is all, and all is one. This is the flow of life, this is the universe. Edward, whether alchemist or not, always was only a mere human being in this stream. No more than the others, but also with a significant existence for the universe.
Everything I may be saying may seem a little confusing. But the fact is, even you go out with a slightly different head after watching. There are so many things that make you reflect on the importance of life, feelings, compassion.
It also urges us to think about what ""Truth"" is. There are characters from many different cultures in Fullmetal, each with their own beliefs - or religion, their own culture. That's why I believe the truth was different for each one.
The Ishvalians, for example, believed in God Ishvalia. But Edward in the laws of the universe. We shape our reality, which is why it is different for everyone. The truth is in you. The truth IS you.
An anime that at first seemed so dark and violent actually has an immeasurable depth with good, sentimental teachings. Still being horrifying in many parts, of course. So much so that characters really die in this anime! It's all very unpredictable and you really get scared if someone is going to die.
Not like the other shounens where the protagonist is the strongest of them all, the good guys remain firm and strong and there are no big losses down the road. On the contrary, it is just the opposite. Although Ed and Al are strong, most of the battles are fought by other incredibly talented characters, mostly adults, not children. Precisely because everything is so unpredictable, the battles, which already had everything to be great, become even better!
Regarding art, I find the appearance of the protagonists basic, but of many other characters is beautiful. Nothing exaggerated, but nothing ugly. I liked very much. The soundtrack is also very good. It fits perfectly with every situation, and will no doubt leave a trademark in your heart.
Finally, the last episode showed us that there are new beginnings even after the end. This is the life. This is the universe. This is the flow in which we live. Yes, this is alchemy!",10

                Non-spoiler review
I have always been curious about why FMA:B is rated no.1 in MyAnimeList. After watching it, I understood completely why it is rated no.1. Its very enjoyable anime for all ages and all kind of people. It has the right balance between pacing of the story and fighting scenes. Just the right mix to create a legendary anime.
 I love how each and every episodes are VERY consistent on the quality and each of the episodes are very important on its own. I also love how everything concludes and there were no plotholes or any of those kind. I love how the story is
                  very consistent too as they never add-in anything at the last minute just for the story but instead slowly unravel the crucial hints to the viewers. All in all , a very pleasing story for everyone.
10/10 Love this anime",10
"
                1. Story = 8.5
 1.1 Main Story (10) = 8
Protagonist finds a way to undo his pact with a god. (about his body and his brother body) This adventure turn upside down by military act of their country and the reason behind that. With 64 eps and with this kind of story. It's too much -1 for that. It does not engage me all the time. Some of the episode will make you yawn because it does not cut to the chase.
However, around the end, things will get more intense. Most questions from the beginning of the story will be answer and what I'm really
                  looking for is all there. So it's worth the watch.
 1.2 Characters/Progression (10) = 9
This show does a pretty great job in progression of the body. At the start of the show, the protagonists will look like a child but in later episode. They will all grown up. Also, all the characters have their past which will project in the story quite well. At least most are share same experience in Ishwa civil war. This make every characters deep and had their motive. 
and most surprisingly is an awesome performance of homunculus in this show. They play a vital row around the end of the show. Their emotion and motive behind them is breathtaking. Their existence or meaning of life is well-design. 
2. Art = 7.5
 2.1 Character Design (5) = 3.5
Simple design and easy to remember yet unique in its own way. Also, suit with the setting of the world as well. 
 2.2 Background (3) = 2
I understand that its old but I can't give point more than this.
 2.3 Animation (10) = 8
For its age to be ten years ago, It has a very well-done animation. All the action that perform in story really match with anime nowsaday. 
3. Sound = 7.5
 3.1 Voice/Dialogue (5) = 5
All voice actors are expressed characters emotion into their voice very well. For example, you may not see face expression of 
Alphonse because he is an armor that walk around but you can feel how he was by the voice that he talks. I really like this. They nailed it.
 3.2 OP/ED (5) = 2.5
OP that good (2 out of 5) = ""again"", ""Rain (レイン)"" by SID
ED that good (4 out of 7) = ""Uso (嘘)"", ""LET IT OUT"", ""Shunkan Sentimental (瞬間センチメンタル)"", ""Rain (レイン)"" by SID
 3.3 OST (3) = 1.5
I only remembered the Main Theme. I don't recall any catching ost than this. So I give this half the full. 
 3.4 Special Effects (3) = 3
The sound of alchemist using is immersive. To create sound that no one hear before and feel like it's real is perfect for me.
4. Settings = 8.7
 4.1 Feeling with Genre/Enjoyment (10) = 7.5
I count this as Action-Fantasy then. It suit its genre pretty well. The action pretty short but they made it with care. 
I can say that this is masterpiece if it cut some unimportant things out from the story. Unrelated part make story too long and boring and I see a lot of this in early episode but in latter it's very lit!
 4.2 World Design (5) = 5
Great job with world design. After you pregress through the story, you will realize that there are more than two nations in north, east west and south. This intrigue me to look for more in the world of FMAB.",8
"
                Well this is my first review. Out of all the animes i watched, this one stood out. The story was fast paced but was really interesting. I recommend watching the original fullmetal alchemist before watching this because the old one is slower in pace. 
The story is really good so i gave it 10/10.
Art was a bit better when compared with the two fullmetal alchemist.
              ",9
"
                First 10 episodes are really boring, in fact I left watching FMAB after them and thought would never look back. But from episode 11-20 it is just fabulous. It's here where they make you watch the next episode just after the current one finishes unlike the first 10 episodes. It is a visual treat to watch battle between Roy & ---(censored to avoid spoiler) in episode 19. Story is told in a fine way, art could have a bit mature like death note but this I guess appeals more to teens. Talking about sound 'Again' by Yui is great but other openings and closing songs
                  are just okay. Edward Elric is a very focused character. Alphonse lacks character development and is interpreted as a side hero, most of the times he is seen helpless and weak in battles. Few characters and topics who deserved more screen time and background story telling are Roy Mustang, Trisha Elric, Doctor Marcoh, water alchemy, flame alchemy, etc. Ending feels stretched over lot of episodes thus loosing the impact a little bit. Overall the ending is good but lacks a fulfilling climatic ending fight. Some major questions are left unanswered like what did ling do with the ps when he got back ?, can alphonse still perform alchemy without transmutation circles ?, etc. I wonder what would have happened if the Elric's didn't perform human transmutation, probably no one could have saved Amestris then. It's over dramatic when Izumi Curtis and her husband meets the Armstrongs. Sloth is a very badly written character.",8
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is an immaculate show. From the characters, plot, art style, action, and thematic elements: all of them are masterfully crafted. The show has very serious themes and asks the viewer very deep questions like: what it means to be human, how does one value sacrifice and loss, the plausibility of zero sum games, how far are you willing to bend or not bend your morals for your goal, and so many more. As well as touching on themes of brotherhood (of course lmao), loss/sacrifice, morality, mortality, human nature, genocide, friendship, love, as well as plenty of others. The characters are all very
                  nuanced and have much depth to them, all of the characters are complex in nature with tangible motives. The action is top tier and extremely entertaining. And the plot is so well executed and planned out, like the show ends with no loose ends. The soundtrack is extremely catchy as well. All in all, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a masterpiece that I would highly recommend to anyone. A perfect 10 out of 10.",10
"
                You can feel all the emotions of the characters sincerely. You get angry when necessary, you get sad when necessary, and sometimes you get annoyed, but  you can connect to all of them.An anime that can definitely be called a masterpiece. Although it is not very new, its animations and drawings were quite satisfactory. The opening music was excellent. You also feel the brotherhood of Ed and Al most sincerely.you can feel love too.ofc not as much as in a romantic anime But you definitely feel it. I can guarantee it.In short, there are all kinds of emotions, and most of them are deeply
                  felt. You can't always get this chance.You also see how deadly the 7 deadly sins can be.I'm not kidding it's really a masterpiece.Even if you won't watch it now, it's a must watch before you die!Btw sorry for my bad english:)",8
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an amazing anime. 
It deviates significantly from the previous Fullmetal Alchemist anime as Brotherhood follows the manga to the letter. 
One of the most interesting aspects of it is the hard magic system. Alchemy has specific rules and limitations that it sticks to. Deviations have explicit and important explanations rather than being a deus ex machina like a lot of magical systems tend to be. 
There is a lot of mystery and intrigue that's well delivered, makes complete sense, and is just plain satisfying as the plot unfolds.
That said, the story is pretty dark. If you can't handle villains doing truly
                  villainous things, I would recommend you not watch it. However, it isn't super edgy. The characters feel human and not entirely 2 dimensional or melodramatic.
I love almost every opening and ending theme. That's unironically one of my favorite things about it.
If you prefer dubs, the voice overs are pretty good. I fondly remember the Adult Swim reruns although I later watched it subbed.
My nostalgia is probably influencing the score a bit, but I honestly have nothing bad to say about it unlike other anime from my childhood. It's a solid anime and I highly recommend you watch it.",9
"
                Have you ever wondered what is the greatest anime to ever exist? Well here it is. This is undoubtedly the greatest anime to ever grace this planet deadass no CAP on GOD. The best word to describe this god-sent gift is LIT. It is so lit that it may as well be a part of the litty committee which I myself am in charge of. Yes, it is that good.

"
                I used to watch this show back when I was around the age of 13 to 14 but I didn't get the opportunity to consume the series as a whole until I was 17.
At the end of the day, I am extremely glad to have finally gotten around to it because this show was an extremely well-executed series that balances a plethora of both subtle and diverse themes that can be enjoyed on a number of different levels and the series' ability to disguise more mature themes into the background of this entertaining story is almost matched by no other Anime I've seen before or
                  really ever since.
There are a few points however that keeps this series from being a 10/10 in my books that range from mildly cliche moments to a wonky first few episodes that don't really gain the true direction or direction of the series until a little bit further on.
Overall none of these issues is anywhere close to being noticeable through the first viewing and they're buried underneath so many other highly well-produced elements ranging from animation, sound design, story, characters/development and interesting lore.
This Anime is definitely one of the must-watch Anime of its time.",9
"
                An indeed legendary classic anime. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has all the elements a typical anime should have from comedy to sheer thriller. I loved the one thing about this show is Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has shown profound character development of each of its characters including Maria Ross to chimeras like Zumpano. In the end, the friendship part is most focused upon like in the Dragon Ball franchise. At the start, I was reluctant to watch it because of so many characters and a totally new technique in anime called alchemy, but I kept going for a few episodes, and then after that, this show build
                  up a great story and I couldn't stop myself from finishing. Overall it's a wonderful anime with the precaution that it's a little dark which only mature people can handle. I would say don't hesitate. GO FOR IT, it would turn out to be one of the best anime you've seen.",10
"
                I have seen the original FMA. What's the difference??? This version is better than the original. The story, characters, everything is perfect. Every episode is canon and none of them are fillers, that's the best part. The villains were also likable. They are powerful in their own ways. If you noticed, the characters' appearances especially the MC is aging, which is also required to see the time during watching the anime.  Truly a masterpiece. It deserved the No. 1 spot. Very enjoyable to watch but not for little kids though, wait for them to reach 10 years old. 
SPOILER:
There is a scene that it
                  will leave you a great depression after watching that scene. Believe me,  I became depressed after 1 hour.
So watch it now, if you haven't. I'm also worried about the live action of this anime. Pls. don't ruin it.",10
"
                Story - I'm honestly not a huge fan of the actual story. I can look passed potholes but some things seem sloppy or only halfway thought out (example, the gold toothed doctor). I don't hate the story but the fact the last fight because Edward punching shit in your typical Shounen fashion kind of really devalues the more interesting Team dynamic between Alphonse and Edward that they had in the beginning of the series. It's far from terrible and I kind of wish it gave more of an idea of what every character did after the events (it doesn't tell you what Olivier Armstrong or
                  Izumi Curtis is doing at the end) because the show felt like such an ensemble but instead it only focused on Edward and Alphonse and I find that to be a weakness. 
Art  - Gets an 8 because while I like the style and the visuals are great, it still suffers from the fact it spans 64 episodes and therefore there is a lot of people laying still in the frame with only mouth movement and the camera pans slightly. Otherwise, I like the style and some sequences look stellar. Very solid.
Sound - Some of the music is great, some of the music is very forgettable and serviceable at best. It was never distractedly bad and some tracks really elevated the scenes. The sound effects were fine, no complaints. The english dub is way quieter than the Japanese dub for some reason so switching between them was kind of a pain but this is a minor problem. Overall the sound was alright. I wanted to give a 7 for the sound but it gets an 8 because of those few tracks that really pushed a scene from being typical into fascinating.
Characters - The best part of this anime. I have heard arguments that the 2003 anime has better character development and that may be true. But the reason this show kept me at all was due to some of the really strong characters that I liked. So many very strong female leads which surprised me like Hawkeye, Olivier, Ross, etc. It wasn't perfect but it was by far the biggest reason I kept going with this show and the story is very much secondary to the characters and I'm fine with that.
Enjoyment - I only gave it a 7 because Story is such a huge deal for me. I know this show could have an even better story if the manga hadn't been written as it went and was planned a bit better in advance. I can't say I want to watch it all again anytime soon, I just wasn't that enamored with it and I think it's highly overrated for being ranked so highly... I just don't see why. It was alright though.
Overall - A solid 7. Definitely above your average anime, still don't understand the overwhelmingly positive reviews. It's elevated above most Shounen so maybe that's enough. I still prefer the HxH manga to something like this.",7

                Overall Rating 10/10
This is one of the anime that you can call ""Original"".
I will keep myself from writing any big spoiler.
First of all, the most important one, the story.
At early episodes, you will see this anime as a general shounen anime with naive MC that doesn't want to kill anyone with a big dream on his heart of returning their original body back. But as the story progressed, you will see the exact differences. That is because instead of winning by being OP thanks to nakama power at the lasts second in a battle, you will often see MC either being saved by someone else
                  or running away instead. Me, who actually expecting a generic shounen, am impressed by how good the author played the cards on their hand. Even though he seems so OP, seeing the despair in that anime makes even me realize that his OPness is only a small being compared to the climax. 
The author also played the "" sacrifice"" and ""equal exchange"" thingy beautifully. 
As for Art and Sound, I'm pretty impressed too. The OP and ED fits pretty well, and the BGM were played out nicely. The art animated beautifully for a 2011 anime, though in one of the fighting scene, I realize some minor things like when there are 2 people join hand fighting a single enemy, while one of them fighting the other one just stayed still for a few seconds which is weird. But that doesn't stop me from enjoying the scene.
The characters development is one of the good thing too. I thought that most of the important role might become naive after meeting MC, but surprisingly they still maintained their former personality, but I still can see the character development. Some of the example were Roy and Greed.
It's definitely something worth trying, and doesn't leave a bad impression.",10
"
                Although there were some important informations in the original than ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"", I prefer ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" better because of better plot line. Furthermore, the art is really good that even my friends who watched it didn't realize that Ed beat Winry's height. I don't remember when that happened either...On the other side, it's really grotesque. There's a lot of blood and it's a surprise that some of the main charatcers didn't die of blood loss. And a lot of people dies. I'm not going to tell who, though.
Overall, it was an oustanding story. I hope you'll watch it too.
P.S. I heard that the
                  dubbed version was pretty good... I actually watched it and it was one of the best dubbed anime I've ever seen!",10
"
                One of the things that defines a good anime to me is when it both stands the test of time and how it is when compared to other anime I watch.  With those things in mind, I can't say enough how much I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  I have watched ALOT series since watching it, and this one still ranks up very high for me, even almost 10 years later.  
It's funny, I enjoyed the original FMA series so much back when this came out that I avoided this series, in fear that it would somehow make me upset at the mishandling
                  of this series when compared to the original.  I waited until the series was almost over before starting it, and in the end I kicked myself for denying myself this series.  The story does get slightly weird at the end, but it cleans up nicely.  The characters are great, and you get alot of new characters to follow and like to really set it apart from FMA.  Art is good, this one has more comedy than the first series, and it is pretty well done.  This is a great series for new or seasoned anime watchers, and for me serves as one of the series I use as a ruler on how other series measures up.",10

                This Anime was my first and i was hooked on the first ep and its just the bestest anime of all time no cap and i could alwasy rewatch this masterpiece and the character are so good and the villans are so good like in this anime there is no bad arc imo and this is a anime that i would recommend to a new anime watcher and i recommend this anime to everyone
 I just love how well writen edward elric is he is just the best MC in all of anime imo and the sound effects are so good like it gives me
                  shiffers through my spine on some scenes",10
"
                Although I have not read the manga or watched the original version of Fullmetal Alchemist, I can say that this anime is the whole definition of perfect. From the animation straight to character development, was absolutely outstanding.
The story is very unique as the two brothers; Edward and Alphonse have one main goal, which is to get back their original bodies. Through this tough journey, they have to overcome many barricades with the help of others. The story is exquisite as it also focuses on the other characters apart from Edward and Al. Therefore each character gets their own sort of development and this gives the
                  audience a better understanding of every character. The way the story is set and how it slowly unveils the true intentions of the characters,  even the villains, makes the audience feel quite sympathetic towards them, even though they have caused a great deal of damage to others due to their selfish desires.
You could clearly see that there was a lot of time and effort put in the animation, which makes the anime even more appealing to watch. Fullmetal Alchemist is an anime that definitely gets better to watch as the episodes go on. Through part 1, the story is quite slow-moving but it suddenly picks up pace after part 2 and it puts you on the edge of your seat waiting for whats to happen next.
The sound was beautiful from the openings to the original sound tracks, which fit accordingly to its chosen scenes. This made the anime more emotional and tense. 
Overall the anime was impeccable with minimum defaults. I would definitely recommend to anyone.",10
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, is quite an amazing watch. It nails its interesting setting, featuring tonnes of world building and fitting characters with individual values, cultures and reasons to fight. And therefore following the Elric brothers on their difficult journey to get back what they lost. Truly feels like 2 kids crossing paths with the worlds powerplayers and getting entangled in the nations larger conflicts.
To repeat myself, then it's an amazing watch, that at least partly deserves the praise it's recieving. However its really broad appeal may have hindered it's potential. 
At times it feels as if the series is having an identity-crisis. With deep dives
                  into serious story telling, such as multiple army-characters being haunted by their past contributions to an ethnic genocide. And other times it flips and uses very ""anime"" comedy such as slapstick humor to brighten the mood. Which (and I hate to say this) I actually never found genuinely entertaining as much as forced. The very ""shonen like"" conflicts and fights also end up feeling a bit the same. Like they were meant to entertain a younger audience. Losing a lot of the groundedness to the supernatural abilities, by introducing characters with so strong abilities it gets hard to understand them in context to the rest of the universe.
My biggest complaint with this series however, is something I have to reserve to the soundtrack, which is odd, as I usually don't put this much focus on the music, I've also never head anyone complain about this, so keep in mind this is exclusively my opinion.
But I disliked the soundtrack, not in itself, but mostly how it was implemented. Again, it feels like it's executed with a younger viewer audience in mind. There are many emotional scenes in this series that would actually be more impactful if there was different or even no music at all.
There are also ""themes"" that play at certain times. Such as when something is revealed, or there's mystery plot afoot, or when a fight is going on. It sounds good, but many of the tracks are so bold, loud and most importantly  overused, that it can get atrociously repetetive if you're binging the series. 
Now that might sound like an overly negative point to leave an otherwise positive review on. But I think it says a lot about what this series does right, if these are the primary concerns I've got. FMA Brotherhood is absolutely a series you must watch if you'd like to jump into an interesting universe you've never seen the likes of before, that will keep you entertained for all 60+ episodes. All I wanted was to address a criticism of the series that I haven't seen yet, and I still enjoyed it to the point that I'd only give it 1 point less in a review score that it has otherwise been recieving.",8

                REVIEW WITH NO SPOILERS
FMA is one of my first animes (tha classic version)... and the story is really great and fun. But the classic and the Brotherhood has a lot of differences.
First, let's talk about this one isolated. The story is outstanding: all the philosofical and mystical elements, the metaphors... but it has some deffects. I thought the FMA classic had a lot of supporting characters but this one breaks records in this task!! And it's not like they are useless... actually there some really charismatc! But in some situations with them, it happens an EX MACHINA effect.
I could say that this version explores the
                  FMA universe way better than the other.
As well, the animation is better than the classic one... there are some deffects but the fights are better and the Bones Studio reached a high level and consistance here. And the end of this one is more satisfying and exciting.
So if you are looking for a fun mystical adventure and a really good (techincally) anime, here it is!!",9
"
                Minor but basically irrelevant spoiler warning...Except the character section which is paragraph 5...do not read that if you do not want to literally have it ruined for you. But if you cbf any of it it's 10/10 overall in my very unprofessional opinion.
Ok so to be honest, this is the second review I have written for this anime. However I deleted the old one because I realised how susceptible I am to viewing something I just finished enjoying through a filtered lens and did not give as honest a review as I would have liked to. From the start I will say that regardless of
                  the re-write my rating is still 10. However it will not be as hard of a 10 it will be worth more because without the filtered lens I still view this as a masterpiece unlike many others which usually lose value in my eyes when I start to look deeper.
Let me say that in any other circumstance I would probably have given this a 9/10 for story. Even with the very...I struggle to find the word...um...issues with the final arc (Anyone who has watched the anime will know what I am referring to but do not let it differ you if you have not). The only reason I would drop the story to a 8/10 is because honestly it just does not start up as strong as the 2003 anime. And though I do not want to judge them the same, it simply is that we saw what it could have started as and if both combined the best aspects of each other I think story wise it could have come out as a true masterpiece. I can not drop it any lower than a 8/10 though because as far as story goes it is still a cut above the rest. Mainly due to the many intricacies of the plot that tie in so very well. With such weight placed on philosophy and the value of a soul everything feels like it has weight beyond the lives and world of those in the anime. I would like to note that putting story for 8/10 only occurred due to me trying very hard not to rate it higher as I truly do believe it to be great however I can not ignore the issues that came about.
Art was good for the time. I appreciate the lack of fan service being shoved in your face and the detail put into transmutations. The art style though appearing simple is actually one of my favourites and though it may be partly due to bias on that it could influence the rating. Objectively however I think the we'll say dusty style of art suits the old setting of the anime. 8.5/10 The mark being less than 9 is me trying to slightly dull the bias.
Sound was overall great honestly great. I remember the sound tracks being very classical but suiting the themes of the show and whatever setting they were played in well. Unfortunately I don't really pay attention to OST's most of the time. The openings and endings however were exemplary. I can say without a doubt that the second opening for good reason and how they used it will always sit in my heart fondly. All of the openings and endings however are great, foreshadowing most of the time is very creative, seen most in the first opening (I realise this is less about sound now but I usually judge sound like this due to lack of anything else I recall to judge when watching anime). Now I'll be honest, in most case I am way too impatient to sit through endings to anime (bar some exceptions). But in the case of FMAB I feel as if I have cheated myself to not let them run as they are some of the greatest you will hear and have the pleasure of viewing in my opinion. 8/10
Characters show continuous growth throughout the series. What can I say? Ok look there will be more SPOILERS for this one so prolly stop and just accept you should watch it if you haven't. If you don't care. Keeping reading. The series manages to fit a good deal of character development in for not being long running. Before I go into the good I must critique what they could have done better. Which falls into the first third of the series. Maes Hugh's needed more time for the viewers to care like in 2003 just as the Shou Tucker ARC needed that extra episode. I feel like Lust could have been done better but at the same time I am less effected by her treatment as I think however way she was dealt justice was done to her character in different ways. I want to first acknowledge Mustang overcoming the loss of a friend. Because to me that is what stuck out most in his character. Beyond him trying to become Fuhrer by moving up the ranks, and beyond being a guardian of sorts for the Elrics I think the most interesting part of his character was watching him trying to follow through with these self appointed obligations whilst trying to deal with the losses that life had dealt him. Eventually this became too much as he exploded on Envy in the end where his constant bursts of fire represented his uncontrollable rage. Who better to take it out on than Envy who is one of the biggest reasons for Mustangs pain? I think this is why he is a fan favourite. That and he makes f***ing fiery explosions by snapping his god damn fingers. I think Ed and Al Both place blame on themselves for each others fate and it was beautiful to see them go on in hopes to find salvation for themselves but more importantly each other. Ed feeling like he needs to bring Al back to his own body regardless of cost and Al regardless of the literally hollow shell of who he was is ready to and did give his life in order to save his brother. Only for Ed to give up what he believed would save them both to save his brother (Alchemy if you didn't guess). I could cover a lot more but I think I've made my point. 10/10 for character.
Enjoyment...seriously I mean look this may be a re-write but I still love the anime. Like the enjoyment section is where I am basically obligated to be bias in my results like come on. 10/10
Side note if you have any wish to discuss philosophy and psychology blah blah blah based on anything you might find in FMAB, some other anime or just for the hell of it, be sure to message me because I love that shit. Have a good one.",10
"
                                      I dropped the original FMA after hearing that FMAB was a much better adaptation, so this review is solely based on my opinion of Brotherhood. The only way to truly explain how I felt while watching this is to explain every single element I enjoyed... and every single element I HATED. The basic review structure by Sound, Art, Story, Etc would not do the obvious problems the show has justice and I believe it is the biggest reason the show is rated so
                  highly.
Things I like: 
-Best OP of all time no cap
- almost all the characters. love Al and hawkeye
-the way ""god"" is portrayed
-Every single flashback. Seriously, anytime there was a flashback, the quality of directing and even animation would go up like 3 tiers.
-The general Idea of Alchemy and how it was utilized
-The philosophical questions; morality being subjective, what defines being a person, and Equivalent exchange. 
-That episode with the dog transformation thing. Just a solid episode. 
Things that Sucked:
-Every single ""fight scene"", I swear to god it went the exact way every single time. ""Oh wow, you ar  homunculus. now u must die. oh wait but u wayy stronger and homies with the government so ill wait and pretend like I don't know sheee. ok now let's fight. U can heel and are LITERALLY IMMORTAL??!?!? Ok, mustang come here."" Rinse and repeat that 7 times. Sometimes they get creative like when defeating Sloth but by then I was so bored. The problem with having so many villains is that after a while it becomes a huge chore to just sit there and watch them fight these meaningless battle when deep down you down that eventually it's going to end up in their favor without consequence. 
-When they stand around and discuss the plot forward. Yeah, I hated that.
Like in a good anime like Breaking Bad, It isn't a long conversation about the events in the plot that drives the story forward. It is the events and circumstances and the way the characters react/responds to them which drive the plot forward. 
-The relationships between the characters (except for Alphonse and Edward) 
I completely understand why people thought the relationship between Ed and Winry was handled great. but I think the complete opposite :D.  Ed and Winry have great chemistry as characters and obviously were gonna end up together and I liked that alot. The problem is that the part where they.. yah know... GET TOGETHER is completely rushed and feels so empty given the fact that Ed DIPS immediately after confessing just like his father. 
Also Mustang and Hawkeye... yeah that was supposed a THING. Felt like there was so much build-up and then I was robbed.
Final Thoughts:
This show is good when it good but is really boring most of the time but your brain tends to suppress it from your memory entirely. This show just feels so unsatisfying I almost want to say it should be continued, but I really doubt with the ending it can. 
Very Iconic, show is worth watching but definitely OVERRATED.
6.7/10",6
"
                I'm literally in tears both of joy and sorrow after watching this anime. It's a complete masterpiece, what else can I say.
Don't miss out on this one. It's perfect for everyone. 
Even the opening and ending songs are so good, and have very good messages with them.
Out of all the openings, OP-5: Rain is my favorite. Every time I listen to that, my eyes just couldn't stop raining tears. 
I'm sure that you'll guys also go through same emotional feelings.
But wow, this anime is just awesome ♥
Character development is also very good.
It's packed with humor so that you don't get bored.
I love the moral, and
                  the way this anime is directed.
I don't want to type a lengthy review, because rather than reading my review, just go and watch the anime instead.
I hope you guys watch this anime.",10

                Several Very Basic Things:
~Great Story
~Great Characters
~Great Voice Acting
It has one of the best stories I've ever seen and the amazing cast of characters, and amazing voice acting. It is also deep and touching at times with parts of the story that are just wow. The animation is also good and you can simply tell a lot of care and detail went into every little thing in the anime. FMAB is one of those animes you show to first timers cause it’s just that good.
it deserves the high praises it gets everywhere. I pushed it away way too often thinking it would be overrated but boy
                  I was wrong !!, it really exceeded my expectations. Truly a Masterpiece.",10
"
                The story of Edward and Alphonse Elric is still one that pulls on my heartstrings. Their completely tragic childhood, the way they went on their profound journey, and SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER ultimately prevailed. 
The characters all had their quirks and individuality. The main cast all had something that made you want to like them and the enemies hate them. They mixed in a lot of humor, political tensions/themes, and very dreary and dark aspects. It found a great mixture between all of it. Plus there was not the huge thing with out of control sexualization that truly gets on my nerves, it was way more
                  mild compared to a lot of other shows. 
I think that it is an inspiring journey and I recommend all to watch.",10

                I went into FMA: Brotherhood without watching the manga or the original 2003 anime, so this review is from the standpoint of someone who really knew nothing about the series or source material.
I'm going to start with what I believe the series' main weak point is: I found the first quarter of the show to be somewhat of a confusing slog. The problem, in my opinion, is that the show introduces a large number of characters and threads at once, and bouncing back and forth between them hinders the development of any one of these threads. The advice many will lend regarding this is to
                  watch the first part of the original anime before jumping into Brotherhood. I can't comment on that approach, so my advice is to stick it through the first part of the show, even if the thought of ""where is this all going?"" comes to mind.
Once these threads come together a bit, the story is really fantastic and intriguing. I found myself constantly wondering how the Homonculi were going to hatch their master plan, and how the alchemists were going to attempt to thwart. The show has a knack for teasing some very intense, epic twists. Additionally, the show looks and sounds amazing and really sets the bar for other shonens. It has a really amazing art style throughout, especially when it comes to the dark, supernatural aspects.
I found the cast of characters on FMA:B''s journey to be enjoyable and interesting. Learning about everyone's backstory's was compelling and very much important to the overall story. Ironically, the two characters with the most boring/plain backstory were probably the two main protagonists. I initially was somewhat annoyed by Edward being little more than a cheesy caricature at first, but he does develop quite well and become likable.
The final quarter of the show was not quite as exciting as the middle portions, mainly because a lot of the mystery was wrapped up at this point, and what remained was for our heroes to defeat evil once and for all. I definitely enjoyed the ending of the show, but the show still really shines in its middle, and the thrilling intrigue of that portion is what makes FMA:B such a fantastically rewarding show.",9
"
                I can rap this up by just saying this is the best anime ever, great for any crowd with an open mind and thirst for knowledge. 
But to go deeper, its about two brothers on the road to find out the secrets of their world, and this world just happens to have alchemy in it(ability to shape environment and such). 
The ending is great, it will make u think. 
little to no perverseness with great characters that you can cheer for. 
cool fight scenes.
every episode progresses he storyline.

                There's a reason this is #2 on MAL. I originally didn't want to watch this because I binge watch all animes, so 64 episodes seemed too time-consuming. BUT after finally being nagged by my friend to watch, I did, and I was sucked into it. It's so worth the time it takes!
The plot is action-packed but incorporates some deep themes (e.g. nature of humanity, divine power, family) and light-hearted moments as well! 
The art is great. Everything is full of color, and the contrast between duller scenes really serves well to emphasize the more sullen nature of them. I also think the classic anime expressions
                  were incorporated very well. The battle scenes are depicted amazingly too.
I really liked the soundtrack, though it doesn't make it my top 1.
I think the character development was good, and it was present in supporting characters as well! In fact, I'd say the character development in one of the supporting characters matches (or even exceeds) that of Ed himself. The only complaint I have about the characters is that Winry seems to become irrelevant towards the end of the series, which was a bit disappointing.
Overall, this is a great and must-see anime. If you want action, it's here. If you want humor, it's here. If you want deepness, it's here. 
One thing I find particularly interesting is how although this anime/manga is probably the most well-known shonen, it was actually authored by a woman. I liked observing the contrasts between the various female protagonists, but that analysis is just for me :)",10
"
                I just finished watching FMA Brotherhood AGAIN after a few years of not rewatching, and once again I cried and laughed with the characters and practically devoured the entire show. It’s just a piece of art - interesting and captivating from the first episode to the last, only one filler/recap episode (and even that one offers new insights), a great (first) opening, a lovable and diverse cast and many deep and intriguing storylines woven together in a net of questions and answers that won’t let me put the show down until I watched the entire thing through in a matter of days - in fact,
                  this show was the entire reason I just did pretty good on a final exam yesterday, because I only allowed myself to watch as many episodes as I revised that day! Also the length of the anime is PERFECT - enough to fully dive into the world, but not so much that it stretches beyond something you can’t watch and finish in a few days and weeks. The ending is very satisfying - hurts just enough, leaves you wanting more just enough, but also satisfies plenty and doesn't leave you hanging (which is pretty important for me when picking up an anime and devoting days of my life to it)! 
All in all, this might‘ve been the best time I’ve had with the show ever since I first watched - since it‘s been a few years, I’d forgotten many details and some more major plotpoints, but still knowing the characters and their journeys well enough, I connected to them on a level I hadn’t been able to on my prior viewings. Maybe because of my prior knowledge, maybe because I’ve grown as a person myself since I first watched this at like 16 years old. Especially Ed - I liked him a lot in my prior viewings already, but he might’ve just overtaken my other favourites in this show and become one of my overall favourite characters in anime in the span of this rewatch (what a truly basic pick, especially with having had Mustang as a favourite before.. probably half the populations top two, at least after episode 19). Anyways - legit bawled my eyes out on the outro - had a great time 10/10. 
To break down:
The art has aged a bit at this point, but it still looks very good - just not an anime I'd recommend on the basis of visuals purely (7). The sound is petty good aswell and I adore the first opening, but overall the sound is not as outstanding as some other animes I've seen (8). For the characters I'm inbetween a 9 and a 10 - this show is full of diverse and interesting characters and some great story arcs. I'm leaning slightly towards the 9. Lastly, for enjoyment and story I'm giving 10s, because I enjoyed every minute of watching this AGAIN, for at least the 5th time now (maybe more, I didn't start counting my anime consumption until I was in deep already). I absolutely love how many deeply intriguing plots are woven into the main storyline for it to still run at just 64 episodes - without feeling rushed or overexplained at any point!
I should really finally check out the original some day now...",10

                My reviews on this anime is pretty goofy but challenging. That said latest get on with it. The anime has very good pacong though it Start's off as boring at first it actually does do a very good job at keeping consistently especially well done. The show focuses on brotherhood hardships and philo aspects of life which is very insightful and informative to the new anime watchers as it has abit of an eye opener lesson to it. It is also very challenging to watch especially when you are alone as some episodes forgive me but it gets boring of course its very Goff to
                  watch. The best lessons I have learned from here. The fight scenes were good the music were good also everything a bout it was awesome and deep. It is also very relationship to me as I am also short like Edwards haha dad",10

                While many series can hold the passing interest of an audience due to novel concept or execution, create hype by playing up a recent trend, or revamp an old idea with some original magic, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood delivers on all fronts from start to finish. 
In a world where Alchemy has trumped science  ,two brothers embittered by the loss of their lone mother pledge to use forbidden methods to resurrect he. Suffering terrible consequences, the two are forced to embark upon a journey that will lead them across the continent, as they experience war, tragedy, and an evil that coils around the very heart
                  of the land. 
Whereas the first series focused in on a smaller number of set pieces and actions, Brotherhood roars out of the gate and almost never lets down the pace. With every episode devoted to furthering the plot arch's, the story is very focused and driven. Though it lacks some of the fun that was exploring characters on ""off-days"" in the original series, it compensates with action that keeps you glued to the screen. 
The animation was top-notch, with many of the abilities used my the Alchemists wonderfully rendered. The world is party static in terms of interactivity, by the cast chews up the scenery and spits it out at every turn, so this is hardly the focus.
While the soundtrack to the original was appropriate, if noticeably re-used, the emotional connect with numerous tracks is a testimony to how well-placed much of the score was. From the overture to the haunting, Chaconne-sounding end, it was a memorable experience. 
The characters are universally fun and different, a particularly enjoyable exercise being to contrast the differences between the series. My only criticism is that some of the characters lose some depth due to a larger cast in this series; this being more than compensated for by a widely different and fun group, plus a better realization of the romantic sub-plots.
All-in-all, another resounding champion of the genre. The series is the heavyweight hitter for accessible, fun and mature treatment of all the topics it broaches, and is a must-see for anyone interested not only in animation but quality cinema in general.",10

                Hi,
Well, let us first of all talk about the story very briefly. Two sons lost their mother and sought to recover her. They became alchemists, but their attempt was unsuccessful, one of them lost his body and his soul was locked in a body of iron, and the other lost parts of his body; In this show, we will see their adventures as they strive to return what was taken from them.
I think everything is clear for now, but .....
The show itself is very interesting, wonderful and beautiful, the effects and sounds deserve a 9/10 rating, the graphics and animation are at a very good
                  level, but the realisation and the story, here I want to clarify some points:
The story is great and good, but unfortunately it is not original. You may see several anime when you see that the hero has lost something in the beginning, then the adventure start, same thing here, so the story here needs to be renewed, we need new ideas that not make me feel ""Oh, I saw  some show like this anime before "";
The realisation has several question marks. Yes, the events are somewhat fine, but there are scenes in which you will wonder about ""what does the producer want to tell me here?"" I don't want to spoil you, so I'ill stop here.
And now the question that haunts you now: Should I watch this anime?
I will answer: Yes 100%, you will not regret every minute of this anime. FMAB deserves to be fully evaluated, although I think that a 10/10 evaluation is too much for him, but we all have different a point of view. 
So yes go watch it it worth it",8
"
                FMAB is a darling of anime. I think it's good, but not as great as
people say.
This review will mostly be negative, but here's the positive. 
- The story. The story is beautiful. At face value, it's the story of
  two brothers, Ed and Al, journeying to recover their bodies after
  committing Alchemy's taboo: human transmutation. Their journeys take
  them far and wide, pit them against enemies both human and monster,
  and force them to face their fears. And in the end, they return back  home, to the place they were in their innocent days, away from the
  crazy world of monsters, conspiracies, genocide, and the like. 
  However, it's also the story of Scar, the manifestation of revenge for
  a downtrodden people, and his journey of reconciliation. It's the
  story of Hohenhein, and his journey from slave 23 to being forced into
  an immortal body, facing a seemingly insurmountable enemy in a
  conspiracy that could consume the world. It's the story of Roy
  Mustang, and his journey to turn the country he loves around with a
  band of comrades willing to descend with him to hell.
	The story starts out slow, but once it picks up, you're hooked. You're
  glued to the screen, pressing the next episode button.
- It's a classic shounen. This is both good and bad, but if you like
  classic shounen anime, this one is exactly it. You know the good guys
  will win out in the end, you know there'll be great reveals about
  characters' pasts and how they interrelate. If you like this kind of
  anime, this is the one for you. 
Now, for the negative. 
- The characters. Above, I seemingly praised the characters. Yes, I
  liked their concepts. But I didn't like many of the characters
  themselves. Almost all of the characters felt one-dimensional. Ed and
  Al were standard goody two shoes shounen protagonists. You know that
  they'll never sacrifice their friends for anything. You know that
  they'll fall for silly tricks of the enemy, until of course the grand
  final plan occurs, at which point they'll have predicted everything
  the enemy does (luckily FMAB doesn't have this issue too much, but I'm
  making a point). The other characters are the same. Whenever any tough
  decision arises, you pretty much already know what the characters will
  do.
	Furthermore, there's very little development. Ed and Al seem barely to
  change over the course of 64 episodes. The other characters are the
  same.
	As for the other characters, many got basically no development at
  all. This is fine, but it docks some points for me b/c it detracted
  from the story. I mean, really, Kimblee's men join their group just
  like that?  And then furthermore, in every scene after, they're just
  there. This is standard in shounen, but for such a masterful (and
  mature) story, I was left a little disappointed.
- The world. Usually when I digest some piece of fiction, I can tell
  whether the author did significant worldbuilding beforehand. In this
  case, my verdict is no. 
	There are small details that bug me. What are the power levels of the
  various characters? Ed and Al were completely defeated by Scar the
  first time around, but later they're an even match? Wrath completely
  beats up the first Greed, but the second is fine? As usual with
  shounen, every competent character seems a reasonably equal match for
  every other, which makes no sense. If you have a gun, you beat a guy
  with a sword, and a guy with a sword beats a guy with just his bare
  hands. It isn't rocket science. 
	There are also issues with alchemy. How is it Ed can transform a car
  into a completely different design? Actually, why does Ed usually just
  transform his arm into a short spear-like thing? Why isn't Ed using
  alchemy in more clever ways? At some points, there appeared to have
  been limits to alchemic power, but then we are shown them creating
  massive platforms hundreds of feet into the air. Speaking of which,
  why are there so many alchemists, each with their own special name?
  Shouldn't there be more systematization? Mustang's flame alchemy seems
  pretty OP, how has no one else figured out how to copy it? And
  furthermore, why has the military not tried to get the secret of it
  out of him?
- Comic relief. There's random comic relief. Really random. And
  unnecessary. 
Bottom line: this is an anime you watch for the story, through and
through. Don't expect anything too meaningful. But it does what it sets
out to pretty damn well.",7
"
                This animation is a story of a paranormal phenomenon called alchemy and the alchemist who manipulates it.
All alchemists and non-alchemists are unique, and there are various types of alchemy, and you can feel a very attractive view of the world.
Elric, Edward is a so-called genius with a peculiar talent, a boy but well known as ""Fullmetal Alchemist"".
But the story is not a monotonous success story, and Ed feels frustrated, conflicted, and defeated by other alchemists. Still, he keeps moving towards his purpose.
I recommend it because you will get a very good feeling of satisfaction after watching the final episode.",8
"
                FMAB is a good anime. Everything in this show is good wheter it is the concept of the story, the characters, the soundtracks and so on. But the main problem of this anime is like I said. Everything is good (except for the comedy that was horrible, childish and overused, which remove a lot the impact, the seriousness  and emotions of certains scenes), but there's nothing amazing. 
There's nothing in FMAB who blew my mind away. Not even the philosophy of the serie (which was the main point of the serie).
I noticed that the author of the anime decided to not take risks this
                  time and mainly wrote this story to please the fans. It was most likely a fans service anime which i understand why it is at the top and most likely recommanded by others. 
For least to say, it's the perfect anime for teenagers. The story isn't hard, the plot is predictable and easy to understand, same for the philosophy which is at the level of a high school student. It's a good anime to just sit down and enjoy. I understand why it's so popular, but if you are older, i would say 21+ don't waste your time, you are most likely gonna drop it. Tried to watch it again at 24 and that wasn't it anymore.
It's a 7/10 for me",7
"
                There are anime that you have to watch. There are anime that are overrated and underrated (in your opinion and my opinion.) There are anime that go as quickly as they entered on in the scene. And yet this show always stayed. As a reminder of how to do a shounen correctly. FMAB is hands down one of the greatest pieces of art ever to come out of this medium. And it is great that this site advertises this show as an essential watch for everybody, veterans and newcomers alike. The show has now been talked about for over a decade, and will be talked
                  about for decades to come.
Scores:
Story - 10/10

                My first anime and my eternal love. I cried that's how much I cared for the characters. I was suggested to watch this and was rather skeptical but it truly lived up now I am an anime addict. The soundtrack is perfection the story telling is immaculate and the quality is astonishing a must watch for everyone!
One will come to a sad realization that FMAB is one of the best things ever made with a minute amount of content leaving you with such an imprint. The lack of plot holes the lack of issues or complaints will leave you longing for much more but nothing
                  will ever fill the gap. There are only 2 shows in the whole world that reach such a level of excellence that's FMAB and ATLA.",10

                SPOILER FREE***
FMA Brotherhood is the peak of anime, my personal favorite series, and the only anime I can stay deserves a 10/10. The creators went above and beyond and the result is outstanding.
Story:
Incredible story, it does speed through the first 10 episodes but its not something that will detract from the experience. The story is both enjoyable and really builds the world around the incredible cast of heroes and villains.
Art:
Really high quality from start to finish.Sound:
They really topped the original series with its excellent music and spot on sound.
Characters:
You really fall in love with the characters, feel their pain, excitement, and wonder as we follow their adventure.
Enjoyment:
Will have you laughing, sometimes crying, and interested basically the whole way through. Intense and really sticks the landing too.
Overall:
FMA Brotherhood exceed and far surpasses its predecessor. Some will recommend watching the original FMA but in my opinion its completely fine to watch Brotherhood without bothering. This iteration is just complete on its own. Everything is true to the original excellent manga and they pulled everything off amazingly cleanly in its adaptation. Please don't miss this series, it is the best of the best in all of anime.",10
"
                I'm a be real I haven't really seen the 2003 FMA, not that I hate it or anything.. but they really should have waited until the manga was finished.
So FMA:B huh? Where do I begin.. the story about being about 2 brothers: Edward and Alphonse Elric, their main goal trying to get their bodies back. They're trying to find something called the ""Philospher's Stone"" that is powerful enough to fulfill their goals. A doctor warns them it's ""The Devil's research"" if they try to find out how to make it.
Don't wanna give too much away but this show isn't afraid to get dark, because early
                  on.. it gets messed up real fast. It's still a good show, Edward is still trying to work through his trauma.. slowly but surely! Lot of the characters are cool, Ling being my most favorite. The fight scenes are amazing and I love the comedy! If you don't mind a show to go from 0 to 100 then FMA:B is up your alley.",9
"
                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a lopsided experience. 
The world and plot are well-crafted. This is its strong suit, the biggest pulling factor of the show. Its an epic quest with heartfelt moments along the way. Its what anybody would expect out of a fantasy action series. The setting takes place in an area inspired by early 20th century late industrial Germany, with obvious references to WWII, among some other locations being other countries with their own cultures, giving it a sense of geopolitical worldliness. Although the series starts off with a rough first season, mainly only there for exposition, it progresses pretty well into the
                  final sequences of the show, setting up characters and uncovering mysteries along the way. There's a great sense of finality within the last few episodes that really give the series most of its praise. The fights were really well animated and choreographed, I loved the way the music would swell during certain moments. I found the whole philosophy and morality of the show to be uninteresting. With all these cool inspirations, including a literal f***ing gnosis moment, where Edward meets with ""Truth,"" and has literally all of the world's sophia poured into his brain, there's definitely an empty spot where it could've had an extra layer of religiosity and exploration of philosophical beliefs in ""goodness."" Hell, this show is a big reason why people even know about the esoteric magick of alchemy.
 Most of the key plot points had good pacing, not a part really sticks out in my mind that lasted too long, although i didn't like when they were in the winter place, that was really boring. The little side stories that existed to make the world seem large in themselves were mediocre sketches. The priest episodes in the beginning were terrible. Also the moment when the guy releases the dummies and they fight them for idk like 5 episodes is really really boring and absurd. Highlights for me were Scar, Ling, Greed, Wrath, and Kim Lee scenes. All in all, it has a sort of a grand building up to the final episodes, which made it cool. The journey along the way isn't as interesting though. This is because of the lack of interesting characters within the show. 
Edward Elric is a generic shonen protagonist. His whole personality revolves around the motive to ""Get Al & I's bodies back,"" which is more of just a personal goal than anything laudable or fiery. Alphonse is pretty bland in this series, he mainly just plays the little brother troupe, and has no actual character development without Edward. Winry is a sorry excuse for a female side character. Its kind of hilarious how badly she is written. Von Hohenheim is also some lame, later introduced character, who only serves to progress plot and nothing else. His backstory is cool but his character is super duper lame, a lot of lost potential. The homunculi are all unremarkable except for Greed. His character is this reject from Father, a confused loner-leader sort of bastard, who finds his own morality along the way, and in fact even shows up Father in the end, which makes his whole development complete. Later on when He and Ling share the same body, it creates a sort of synthesis of characterization, one of my favorite dynamics in the whole show, I just love it when they interact. Kim Lee is also one of my favorites too. Just a genuine cool guy strung along with these idiots. The military crew are all merely problem solvers. There's scenes with interactions between Mustang and Hawkeye that could've been expounded upon, but there's a certain lack of personality from the whole team. Mustang is the only notable one, but there was so much wasted potential that could've made him more cool. I found his scenes to be lackluster in important dialogue. Just generic really. Its clear they went the route of having a diverse cast of characters, constantly making blank interactions, for the shonen world aspect rather than making any memorable people.
The comic relief of the show is god-awful. Its almost cringeworthy how reused the joke of annoying screaming. I find it extremely grating to the experience as a whole, making a lot of moments annoying to sit through because of the terribly written dialogue at times. It takes away from the experience more than I'd like it to.
It did what it set out to do, make an epic story, some cool fights, and used only the bare minimum characterization necessary to make it seem ""cohesive."" The artstyle is generic, yes, but not bad. Animation is pretty good. Soundtrack sounds tight. 7/10",7
"
                	The show did characters very well. There is a wide array of main and supporting cast that each have
their own values, personalities, etc. Most are very memorable. 
The character development was done pretty well, notably so in the antagonists.
	The world building is another thing that the show did incredibly well. The various nations, the history, the
laws, etc. make it all very immersive and well fleshed out. Nothing much else to say here other than it was great.
	The art is one thing I had some issues with. I didn't really like the art style from the get-go, it felt 
simple (though that isn't inherently a bad
                  thing, it didn't seem too well done here). ""Easy on the eyes"" is not always
a great thing. That said, the animation was fantastic for most of the time. CG was only used for a couple things 
(envy and father in their ""true"" forms), though it wasn't used very well. Many parts during alchemy and action had 
me very impressed, and it was very fluid and crisp. 
	The show had very good sound design as well. SFX were well made and fight scenes were put together cleanly.
The OPs and EDs were good songs and I think they fit the show pretty well, but none of them were really memorable-
I can only remember the tune of one off the top of my head and I just finished the show. Additionally, the themes 
in the show itself were especially forgettable. A show like death note had me humming to L's theme every time it came,
but I didn't ever even notice the BGM of the show and I don't think much was gained from it. The voice acting was
done very well (sub), and I've heard a lot of the eng dub from clips and I know it's good as well. 
	The plot was well done, though it was simple. The ending was by far the best part - it was exactly what you 
wanted... though that brings me to my next point. A lot of it was predictable. None of the dramatic moments were
impactful whatsoever, except maybe Hughes' death (though with all the monologuing he did about his family and such
it wasn't hard to tell that something bad would come of him). More on this in the next section. On top of that, I
never really felt ""gripped"" to the series - in fact at some points the only thing keeping me watching was the fact
that I had already seen so much of it (briggs arc). The first quarter of the show was pretty good, the second was 
better, the third was mediocre, and the fourth was best.
	The execution of the show was decent. I think the pacing was fine for most of it - the start could be slower
and the third quarter could be faster - but overall it was good. I think the show could have greatly benefited from
a more serious tone - it would make the dramatic moments more intense, heighten the suspense, and make it feel like 
there was something actually on the line. The lightheartedness of it all made it feel like nothing was important, 
really (I know that's a bold statement but I can't really think of any other way to put it). A component of this
was the all-too-often comedic relief and chibi moments. I feel like many of the moments that could have been heavy
and intense were ruined by a reused joke followed by a chibi sequence (see: ed is short). Most of that, however, was
only in the first half and as things got more serious it got much better. My final nit to pick is that the show does
too much telling and not enough showing. Sure, Ed and Al want their body back. It's the whole driving force of the
show. But I think they don't show us why - they show us all the benefits of Ed's metal arm which gives him a weapon
and durability, and Al's body that never gets cold or tired. However, they tell us a million times why they lost
their bodies and that they need to get them back, without showing us the psyche issues or all the nights Al needs to
stay awake because he doesn't sleep. The closest thing they do to that is talk about how Al wants to eat and taste 
again, but I feel like it could have been so much better in that regard.
I made a lot of criticisms, though I did genuinely enjoy the show a ton. I expected a lot out of it because it is the number one anime on countless sites, but I just don't think it lives up to that name. I thought on whether I would give it a 9 or a 10 for a long time, but I've settled on a 9 - though it's easily the highest 9 on my list.",9
"
                Somewhat spoilery review of why I love this show. I'm not really going into an objective breakdown of what good anime should be, but I want to talk about why the story of this series is such a compelling one that I still think about today:
Now over 10 years since the completion of this series, I've looked back and wondered if Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was as good as I remembered. Why would anyone want to go back and watch it today? Is it really a classic masterpiece that still holds up, or is it a fairly standard action show by today's standards? First of all,
                  yes, I think it's still amazing. This was the show that got me into anime and I still love it.
I need to start by noting that I think the goal post has moved for shonen anime today. The best of the best as of 2020 and in the last few years are absolutely gorgeous with stellar action choreography, animation, and effects. Fights are hype and exciting as heck. And that's what we're all here for when it comes to shonen. 
When the original FMA and FMAB came out, its contemporaries were the likes of Dragon Ball, Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Inuyasha and Fairy Tail. While many of these shows are still beloved today, they did kind of drag on with tons of filler, and you had to wait ages to get to the good fights. Shonen of this era tended to have high peaks but pretty low lows as well. Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, however, with its comparatively low runtime, is remarkably consistent in its quality throughout.
FMA stood out in another way. What these other shows provided was a constant stream of cool fights, cool powers, cool characters, and sense of constant and inevitable progression as we watched the protagonists become stronger and stronger, and we consequently became invested in their growth. However, FMA kind of doesn't do that. There are fights, sure, and I think some of them are pretty cool particularly near the end. But the steady stream of one-on-one fights, the battle of powers, wits and will, that anticipation of ""Oh, man! Ed and Scar are finally going to a show down and it's gonna be epic!"" just doesn't materialize as much as in other shonen. Honestly, this show seems to be barely about the action sometimes. So, why watch this when there are so many hype shonen anime coming out today that drip feed better animated adrenaline filled goodness straight into your eyes?
FMA pulls the same trick as another one of my other all time favorite anime, Mob Psycho 100. The characters all start out incredibly powerful. There are a couple of level up moments, but in general, the show isn't about the main characters getting more powerful. This is where, in my review, I now proudly exclaim, ""It's actually about the characters!"" but I think it goes a bit deeper than that. They still have villains to defeat. Incredibly powerful villains. And if we're not getting stronger, then how do we overcome them? Every major hurdle, every major fight displays the power of one thing: Collaboration. Oh gosh, it's just the power of friendship thing again isn't it?
Our connection with humanity, nature, and all. The duality of the self and others. Everything in this show is about that idea. Every villain sees human connection as a weakness and attempts to destroy it, to exploit it to manipulate other for their own selfish gain, or to elevate themselves above it often through an abuse of religious zeal or scientific power (aka alchemy). Scientific knowledge and religious belief are notable some of the most important core values for many of the main characters. These are things that should be used to serve others and provide hope in their eyes, but are instead twisted into tools of destruction by those who care only for themselves.
Every regret, mistake, or potential dark path for the protagonists involve them forgetting their connections to the rest of humanity and nature. The Elric brothers get struck down by god itself for forgetting their place in the cycle of life, Scar becomes consumed by revenge and mercilessly hunts down those that defy his personal creed, Dr. Tucker is desperate to continue by the progress of his work no matter the cost, Mustang and his crew are haunted by the war crimes they committed in Ishval. And many of these lapses in judgement are caused by the loss of their most cherished and personal connections. For Ed and Al, it's the loss of their mother. The Ishval war starts with the death of a child. For Scar, it's his brother and people. Mustang almost succumbs to destructive revenge himself due to his losses. And the few sympathizing glimpses into the life of the villains all revolve around their own desires for connection, be it Envy's, well, envy of humanity or Fury's pride in his own free choice of his wife.
But what ultimately saves each of them, and the world as a whole, are the vast connections that remain. Every protagonist is dependent on others for support and healing, for their aide and strength, for their knowledge and ideas. In so many shows, the main character is destined to seize victory through their own willpower and strength alone. But in Full Metal Alchemist, none of us are as strong as all of us together. But only if we recognize our mutual dependence and strive to serve others as well. Which each and everyone one of the heroes does. The eventual defeat of the villains requires the collective effort of nearly every character we've met in the show. 
The show isn't about the power of friendship or cool fights. It's about what it means to be human, and our individual role as a part of humanity and the world. All is one, and one is all. And that story of humanity is brilliant one that is told expertly from the first to last episode of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood.",10
"
                How dare the creators of this show forget about best girl Sheska?
At it's core, Fullmidal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a bog-standard Shonen anime. Like most Shonen, this show makes it hard to care about anyone with a bloated, uninteresting cast (aside from a few great characters) it doesn't bother fleshing out. In equivalent exchange for sticking more closely to the manga, Brotherhood sacrificed almost every character having a bigger role and more development that was present in the 2003 show. For example, Lust is turned from a homunculus pondering her own mortality and desiring to be human by any means necessary even if it meant going
                  against her allies in the original show, to a generic Saturday morning cartoon villainess lackey with no goals or agency of her own, known only for her huge pair of tits and drops out of the story fairly quickly in Brotherhood having done nothing of note or importance, never to be brought up again. Honestly now that I think about it, this whole show is like a Saturday morning cartoon a.k.a a Shonen anime. There are no stakes and anytime anything bad happens that would make the show more interesting, it is immediately reversed (especially in the last few episodes).
When deaths happen, it's drawn-out and cheesy with people you don't care about giving their last words for 20 minutes straight while other people you don't care about scream their name over and over. Comedy is much more prevalent in this than in the 2003 adaptation, which gets annoying when it's used in scenes that are supposed to be completely serious.
It's such a shame too, as the dub is fantastic, there were many times where the funny moments made me keel over with laughter, and any scene with Roy Mustang (and Sheska) is guaranteed to be phenomenal. But ultimately, I just can't see anything in this show that warrants it to be the #1 anime of all time. It's not even good enough to be the best Shonen anime. So to watch people claim it's the best anime ever makes me laugh.",5
"
                This anime is by some reffered to as the best anime ever, and while i can certanly see why it on some points could be a contendor there are just way to many things that rub me the wrong way for me to agree. 
First of all is the ending. In my oppinion it is one of the most anticlimactic endings i've ever experienced, and that's not to say it was bad. In most other animes i've watched it would've been good enough. But my problem with it is simply that it's a letdown. I spend the series watching these people grow, become stronger and
                  just generally become more fleshed out character. Just to then have the main villain become the most steriotypical bad guy and start shooting lasers from his hands. And that's not even mentioning the METAL-ALCHEMIST getting stuck to a rock by a METAL object which results in his brother having to sacrifice himself. We also have the brother who many previous times during the series has repaired himself with alchemy, but for some reason he doesnt do it. This actually happened a bunch of times, if there is a reason i didn't understand it. 
The reason this bugs me is that the beginning was great. The chimera episode was amazing and i loved colonel roy mustang. The mystery Führer Bradley was also a very dope addition. And this is the reason these little inconsistansies and poorly played out moments annoy me so much. Because i was expecting so much more.
Now of course there are positives. The soundtrack is amazing, i give it a 10/10 and i frequently listen to it just for enjoyment. The art is also amazing, these are some of the best fight scenes i've ever seen. The characters are also wonderful, as previously said i absolutely love Roy mustang, but Bradley, Riza, Marie Ross, Lin and Greed were amazing. The only reason i didn't give the show a 10/10 in character is because of the main character. I think they are very bland and while Alphonse is fine Edward just annoys me so much. And since the main characters often are the most important i have to drag it down a bit. Luckily the show often focuses on other plotlines and that's where it REALLY shines imo. I would've loved to have watched the ending but with just Bradley vs Roy Mustangs people.",7

                This was my third ever anime i ll be honest, but I still think this some sort of gta of anime lemme explain. I know it s the highest ranked game but so are the gtas and thats because they have plenty of good stuff that makes almost everyone happy, but it will allways be in the top third or second spot or just even in top 5.
Story: I think the plot is really good, the pacing is really good and consistent, I never felt like some episodes were too dragged. The only little problem I have its with the script as I felt that
                  sometimes it feels like japanesse trying to be more western-ish. And I do believe thats what they went for as even the characters names aren t most of the times asian.
Art: It s pretty well done but it wasn t that groundbreaking, but for anime this one felt really cartoonish, and a friend compared to the last airbender and i think thats putitng it right
Sound: The problem is that its either really repetitive like you ll have the same track everytime it s a tense moments, at times it felt really empty cuz there was nothing playing. But nonetheless some ending and intro ost are good my favorite one was ""let it all out""
Characters: The only dissapointment I have but its not a bad thing is that I expected more complex and top/god tier characters but no one it s really a 10/10, but Eric is still a good mc, him and Al work really well and carry the show, but also all the characters in general are really enjoyable. I don t think I have one that I can say it was bad written. They re all in general +8/10. I liked Mustang, The Armstrong siblings
Enjoyment: It did have a slower start but by the 19th episode i wacthed at least 10 episodes almost every night
My overall rating is a 9/10 (9,15 will be in average as I rated every episode)",9
"
                More than a decade later and its still the king the medium. The plot takes its time and thinly distributes over each episode but uses that time to develop its characters and environment. It is an optimal pacing. You'll find yourself asking questions each episode. The anime just gives you the answers 10 episodes later which can be critiqued writing wise but it is still engaging.
It isn't immature compared to most shounen but doesn't take its self too seriously either which helps the tone. The humor doesn't always land but it does when it needs to. It has consistent central themes of war, politics, and
                  family that are explored to give the series its depth. 
The characters become endearing overtime especially Al. 
The fight scenes are more like problems the protags solve rather than the common combat simulation of who dies first. A bit like jojo. Often solved with magic which brings me to my critique:
Although this is a magic based show, I feel like the magic could be better explained. It claims to have rules but I don't think the rules are really consistent. Like sometimes the protags come across a similar problem that they solved before. For example edward can fix a radio when its completely in pieces but cant fix his prosthesis when it breaks. Like it or not but it seems to be a very much a power level based magic despite how much the show claims it isn't. All the characters have limits on how much raw plot usefulness they can do with their magic but it isnt really clear what exactly those limits are. Then you'll have characters that are OP when they need to be like Roy Mustang that thanos snaps shit with his flames. Thats my only criticism really. Quite a big flaw but doesn't take away from the enjoyment.",10
"
                I really enjoyed FMA Brotherhood, even if some of it was rehashing what FMA already had done in previous episodes. The characters are very likeable, even ones you might only see once, and decisions make sense from a logical stand point. I never had to second guess why a logical character was making a bad decision, because they didn't. 
More so, the plot and music were beautifully executed. The sound track hits emotional beats and the story unfolds in a well paced manner. I loved fight scenes, because with the world building, you actually get to see the creativity and limitations the creator has clearly
                  thought through. Plot twists are nicely foreshadowed, but not so much that the anime is spoon feeding you information. 
All in all, the anime was enjoyable to watch and I never really wanted to skip episodes because they were all entertaining. FMA Brotherhood is a great anime to watch for the first time and again and again when I want to revisit badass, fast paced, cool fight scenes.",9
"
                For my First review on MAL : As a person who has seen a lot of anime , the anime i would suggest to a begginer (who just started to watch anime) , AND a seasoned watcher ....(really to anyone) is most definitely FMAB .
It is 64 episodes long , so it doesnt feel like a short 24 episode anime where they have to rush the story AND also doesn't feel like those 200 episode long shonen anime. And thus it has the perfect length to smoothly unfold its amazing story.
It very nicely blends both the serious and comical scenes . 
A very unique story
                  and i would strongly suggest you watch it if u haven't seen it already!",9

                 ""Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Fullmetal Alchemist"", aka ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" is the second anime adaptation of the FMA manga. Unlike the first anime series, Brotherhood follows faithfully the original material. It's considered a masterpiece and an amazing adaptation by many people, but I disagree.
 Story: 8/10
 The plot is really grandiose: in the beginning the story focuses only on the Elric brothers, but then a lot of new characters are introduced. There are no real plot holes, but sometimes the story can be really predictable, especially during the last arc. The ending felt artificial and saccharine. The beginning is pretty bad too: the first
                  episode is a poorly written filler, and the first 14 episodes cut away two chapters. Also, the world building isn't as good as people say: in fact, we know nothing about all the countries introduced in the story (like Xing or Drachma), except Amestris. 
 Art: 7/10
 The art style is similar to the manga one, but it didn't work as well as the original. It feels lifeless and the bright colors don't fit he dark tone of the story. The backgrounds are really bland. However, the animation is fluid and the CGI is fine for a 2009 anime.
 Sound: 6/10
 I liked the OPs and the EDs, but the OST is pretty forgettable and the same soundtracks (like Lurking) are reused in almost every episode. The japanese dub is really good.
 Characters: 8/10
 Like I said before, FMAB has a solid cast, but not as much as the manga. Also, there are too many characters, and because of that the main character doesn't have enough screen time to grow as a person. The brotherhood between him and Alphonse is never explored.
 Enjoyment: 9/10
 Despite it being inferior to the manga, I really enjoyed Brotherhood. It wasn't really emotional or anything and the themes aren't very well explored, but I just couldn't stop watching it. The only things that I really didn't like were the first and the last arc, the way the main character was left aside and the cheap comedy. 
 Overall: 8/10
 FMAB is a very good anime, but it's not the best out there. It's vastly inferior to the original manga and it doesn't excel in anything. If you're new to the franchise I recommend  to watch FMA 2003 + Shamballa first, and only then to read the manga or to watch Brotherhood.",8
"
                It's one of the greatest anime. 
The character has their own thoughts and feeling, not just something you use to push to the plot. Animation is outstanding, every fight is enjoyable. MC is not overpowered, and there isn't stuff like ""RAGE=MORE POWER"" like every shonen anime does.  Every fight makes sense. And there isn't power that comes out randomly in the middle of the show to stretch to show. On top of all that, this show still has a good plot. Every action makes sense, there is no sugar coating the villain. Yet you still can feel the charisma in different characters. Halfway through,
                  you will start to discover different character's philosophical theories, which is the main conflict between characters. Adding a lot of depth to the character and the plot. The ending is the greatest part of this show, it's one of the best endings I've seen. It starts with Alchemy, it ends with Alchemy itself, like a perfect circle. If it isn't for the somewhat cringy comedy part, it's definitely a 10/10.",9
"
                At first, I though this show was very slow and wasn't going anywhere. But then once I started season 2, I thought it was one of the best shows, not only anime, but SHOWS of all time. Then I continued watching, and now that i am done, i can say it is the second best show I have ever seen. ( breaking bad is no.1). The story is a masterpiece, and you cant help but love all of the characters. ( except May Chang, she was annoying. Here are all my individual points 
Story: 10. story was possibly the best story of any anime ever
                  written, due to the amazing plot twist and outstanding dialogue. Amazing backstory for the Elric brothers as, well, giving a very sad and heart wrenching story for the brothers.
Art: 9. The art for this was outstanding. It also has a very unique character design, not using the traditional pointy chins and instead using round heads and big eyes. The characters are not sexualized, which is a bad thing for some people but i prefer the characters to super sexualized because it is uncomfortable to watch. The animation and fights were also very clean and fluid.
Sound: 10. The music in this show was outstanding. Every opening was top tier, especially "" hologram"" and ""again"". The soundtrack was equally amazing, from the eerie music of the homunculus, to the upbeat music in the battles. It was a perfect soundtrack from end to beginning. 
Characters: 10. The characters in this show were impeccable and probably the best supporting characters of all time. From the military characters ( King Bradley, 
Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Jean Havoc, and Olivier and Alex Armstrong), The Homunculi, ( Wrath, Gluttony, Pride, Greed, Lust, Envy, and Sloth), the main characters ( Edward, Alphonse, Scar, Kimblee, Winry, Ling, The chimeras, Izumi Curtis, Hoenheim, lan Fan, Maes Hughes, Dr marcoh etc...) As you can see, there is a whole cast of amazing characters in this show.
Ending: 10. The most perfect ending in television history. Period. Everything wraps up in a tear-jerking, heartfelt, amazing ending that needs to be studied by future anime writers for years to come. I can not give this anime enough praise and fully deserves the no.1 spot on this website.",10
"
                As i'm sure you already know, FMAB is an anime that is known both to anime watchers and non-anime watchers. It has dominated the polls, taking the spot of greatest anime of all time, but does it deserve that title? Let's look and see.
Story: 10/10 
The story itself is rather straightforward. You have Edward and Alphonse Elric, two boys who lost their mother and attempted to use alchemy to revive her. Unaware of the basic principle that encompasses alchemy - The law of equivalent exchange - Ed and Al end up losing their arm, leg, and whole body, respectively. The boys build their notoriety as
                  top-class alchemists and come across other characters with which the story goes into more depth as they face a threat that could destroy them all. Despite the anime's straightforward approach, Fullmetal Alchemist does an amazing job of fleshing out each character and the world around them, something that the original FMA does not do very well. A testament to this would be the introduction of the people of Xing and the development of characters like the Fuhrer and side characters like Jerso. To add on to this, unlike the original FMA, this anime is faithful to the original manga and paces it very well. The show itself doesn't feel too long or too short; It's just the right length. The worldbuilding and lore are top-tier, touching on subjects like the Ishvalan War and the after-effects of it, which serve as one of the main driving forces in the story.
Art: 10/10
Bones Animation did a great job of animating the series. I don't have much to say about this. Even the animation for the openings was absolutely amazing, the first two openings in particular.
Sound: 7/10
Despite the amazing storytelling, i believe it does fall short on the OST side of things. There were a few soundtracks that would stick with me and others that i'd just forget about. The openings, however, were amazing and well-chosen. The voice actors were spectacular as well. Romi Park and Rie Kugimiya do a wonderful job portraying Ed and Al,  and don't get me started on the Fuhrer and Greed's voice actors. Overall, the cast was amazing and brought more life to the anime, offsetting the ""good but not great"" soundtrack.
Characters: 10/10
The best thing about the series. The original series had more focus on our two main characters, Ed and Al, which isn't necessarily bad. With that being said, I appreciate when stories touch on the main character's surroundings and give you a more thorough understanding of the climate they live in, and Brotherhood exceeds my expectations in that regard. The introduction of the characters from the fictional country of Xing, to seeing the most irrelevant side characters have some sort of role to play. It outdoes it's predecessor in terms of fleshed out characters. Some series have characters that you can't seem to like, but with FMAB, even the most rotten individual is well written. I mean, have you seen how many FMAB fans talk about how great a person Shou Tucker is....?
Enjoyment: 9/10
As you've probably seen (assuming you've read up until this point) I've had nothing but good things to say about this series. It's a very enjoyable series, but the fast pacing might take a bit of getting used to. When i was watching it, I got used to it about 5 episodes in but some people would take about 15 episodes before they got hooked. Each person is different but once you're hooked, you will enjoy it.
Overall: 9/10 
FMAB is an amazing series, especially for those that are trying to get into the anime scene. It's one that I've recommended to friends of mine, both anime and non-anime watchers, and is a great starting point for anyone trying to take a dip into the wide sea that is the anime scene. Don't even watch the original FMA release, if you want it as it was released in the manga, watch FMAB. You will not regret it. :)",9
"
                This show is literally the most amazing show ever. There is not a single part about it that deserves anything less than a 10. All the characters are fully developed and fun to watch. The art is nothing less than beautiful and both the dub and sub are equally matched in their quality. It has a perfect mix of humor and seriousness. This is by far the most enjoyable show I've watched. By the way, if you like Brotherhood, I would recommend also reading the manga since I believe it does an even better job at fleshing out the characters. The extras are also very
                  enjoyable to read.",10
"
                There is nothing I can say about FMA that hasn't already been said. and no words I have express how great it is, masterpiece is best verb to describe it. Firstly do not think of the original Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as the same story or a continuation, because they aren't. They are based on the same story points but their stories go in vastly different directions because of when they were made. The original was made while the Manga was running and eventually they caught up to it, so instead of waiting for new volumes they made their own where as Brotherhood
                  takes place after the Manga is set and sets that as the bottom-line. The first few episodes can be slow as we meet the characters but they aren't bad episodes by any means, just different. As the story goes on and you learn more you put the pieces together with the characters, their problems are mental games you endlessly play in your head as the viewer. Their moral challenges are questions you end up asking yourself. The themes, teachings, and philosophies stick with you years after finishing the show. As you go from knowing what they are saying, to understanding their words, and finally accepting it as real to you as they are the characters. A story of sadness, hopelessness, bittersweet, and hope for good at the end of the story.",10
"
                Brotherhood is a completely different ball game to the first FMA, actually starting the series in the past and spending more time focusing on each character and their developments. There are a lot more characters introduced in the series, such as the people of Xing and Fort Briggs. Because of its darker and grittier tone, the story and characters could go further with what they could allow and it makes for great action and emotion. The ending is much more well rounded and deserved and I think that the final fight is definitely better. 
The characters have been fleshed out a lot more and go
                  into deeper backstories. There is just enough time devoted to side characters that the focus on the main characters isn't lost, but that they are still worth a watch",8

                Short Review: (minor spoilers)
A great anime indeed. Stable quality throughout, thematically consistent (mostly) from start to finish. In comparison, some classics I was obsessed with in my childhood are full of retconned elements (Saint Seiya, Fist of the North Star, etc.). When the actions start to get going, the show is usually a total blast. A few things held it back from perfection for me though, namely, immersion-breaking gags; wishful-thinking resolutions for some core antagonists and a not-so-subtle anti-male ideology (to be fair many anime sport ""goddess-dominating-over-men"" trope, but this issue sticks out in FMAB's otherwise amazing writing for me). Sorry FMAB fans and MAL,
                  but in my opinion there are more stellar shonen/seinen shows. 
For clarifications, I never read the FMA manga, nor have I seen the 2003 anime version. I went into FMAB only knowing the basic premise--that two brothers paid a great price after a transmutation attempted for resurrecting their mom went horribly wrong. On MAL, the show might just permanently occupy the throne of the best rated anime ever. I never hated or resented that (just as being an IMDB user and casual reviewer for years, I've never had a problem with Shawshank Redemption permanently being No.1, despite it's never my favorite movie). Some of my friends shunned MAL for this reason (to quote a friend, ""the rating system on MAL can only give you an idea of the most popular shows, but not really the best shows""). I want to give the top shows here a fair chance, and I am glad to see different views from people here. That said, I started FMAB with my expectations cautiously cranked to 9.5/10. When I finished the last episode, I was happy that the show mostly lives up to the hype, mostly.
Pros: 
+ Overall a fantastic production. Very consistent quality. As a fantasy/action/adventure/military-themed shonen/seinen that dishes out supernatural combat in spades, the show is surprisingly grounded and gripping. Almost on the level of Hunter X Hunter for me (close but not). 
+ Sustained suspense. Around half-way, the show becomes easy to binge in a single sitting. Most episodes ends on an intriguing cliffhanger. 
+ Overall story and themes. A very straight-forward take on modern humanism among other heavy subject matters (Fascism, Scientism, Existentialism, Utilitarianism vs. Moralism, etc.). Again the show shines in its consistency in its treatment of these matters. The entire anime has only one single arc from start to finish (mostly driven by the dual protagonists' quest to get their bodies back).
+ Art and animation. I am sure the design for Envy's true form alone deserves some kind of award. It's one of the best examples of blending 3d and 2d elements in an anime. Butter-smooth explosions and special effects. Characters have their distinct designs (unlike some popular shows that keep copying and pasting the same face on characters). 
+ Endearing characters and their suitable fates. For example, the major twist regarding the protagonists' father is layered and smart, and a clear testament to the talent of the writer/author. Von's ending could have easily been generic (but still proper), yet the author was able to put extra thought into it. Same thing goes with King Bradley, Dr. Marco and Scar. 
Cons: 
- The show seems to be shy/unconfident for being serious and brutal, therefore inserting countless chibi-character sequences, sometimes at the cost of the immersion/thrills (e.g. during some of the most intense and white-knuckled battles the main characters suddenly turned chibi for gags, and the enemies just stopped attacking). I am not 100% against comic relief or gags during intense/mature sequences, but I'd prefer that they don't break my immersion. 
- For a show about demonic forces and their real consequences on humanity, the author went for a wishful-thinking, naïve conclusion for some of the main antagonists (e.g. a certain deadly sin's turn of heart and final sacrifice as he was ""transformed"" after taking over another character's body). This problem, in my opinion, undermines the show's overall believability and the weight of the Xerxes incident (if the lesson Von learned at Xerxes is ""don't let the devil play with your seemingly innocent wishes and desires, for the devil never plays fair"", he should never had led his sons onto the path of Alchemy, but then again there wouldn't have been this story at all). All the serious explorations of morality/metaphysical aspects before the climax/ending were also weakened for this reason. 
- Anti-male imagery dominates the show. I lost count how many times our male heroes were casually bullied or beaten up by super-powered, dominating and sneering female characters. A main villain is just named ""Father"". A most masculine character has the head of a baby, and often soils himself at the mere sight of his ultra-tough sister. The ideal ""family man"" is really just a bubbling idiot who shows off his happy family around (causing dire consequences for himself). By the examples of some characters (e.g. Col. Mustang; Lt. Hawkeye; King Bradley), the author is very capable of writing layered, nuanced and realistic characters. Therefore it puzzles me why she couldn't write more strong female characters who don't need to assert their independence, prowess and dignity by beating men into pulps. To be fair there are other exaggerated representations of this type of ""girl power"" in many other anime, but for FMAB's overall amazing writing, this issue sticks out like a sore thumb for me. 
- Some uninteresting side stories and slow-to-a-halt episodes. Like I said, when the actions start, the show is usually a total blast. There are also quality quiet character moments, but some episodes made me just want to fast-forward. For a large portion of the final climax, Edward as the central character was just given generic brainless zombie-like creatures to fight with. Moments like this made me shout in my thought: ""come on, FMAB, you can do much better than this!""
In conclusion, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a great show with some caveats. 
Baseline quality: 9/10; in the end a strong 8.4/10 due to the issues mentioned.",8

                This is it chief, the supposed #1 anime of all time (at least until ""Shingeki no Kyojin Final Season"" finishes :P).
So I've been putting this one off for a long time and only a year after I started watching anime did I actually manage to watch this one. It took a solid two months to finish (school has been hectic) but the show was worth it. But, does it really deserve the number 1 spot?
""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" is famous for a reason. And not only is it famous, it is really, REALLY good. The story is ridiculously creative and everything comes together incredibly smoothly. I
                  was initially worried they were going to sacrifice the ""let's get our bodies back"" plot line for the other that I can't talk about in detail because of SPOILERZZZZZ but they didn't do that which I appreciate. The story develops very well and once you get through the first two parts you're left with a super fun, epic, enjoyable action/drama which is very nice. It goes without saying that Bones does a great job with animation. I've never been a huge fan of their art style, but that's just my personal opinion, it's better than anything I could draw lol. The Kono omoi wo song is really good. The rest of the soundtrack has some strong points and I really like the voice-acting. Especially Al's voice, it's just super cute/cool/nice/I'mnotgayIpromise. The characters are all really cool. I really like Ed, Al, Winry and Hohenheim. Scar get's really good and ROY MUSTANG aside from having the coolest sounding name of all history is an absolute machine. Maes Hughes is... aaaaahhhhhh- Yeah the Armstrongs are fun and I really like the Xingese guys. Especially May Chang. I mean, she's a cute girl with a miniature panda, how can you not like her? And all the homunculi are interesting. I especially like Greed and his dynamic with this one character I can't mention because SSSSSPPPPOOOOIIILLLLZZZZZZ. All in all the show was super entertaining and fun.
However, despite being the #1 anime I do have a few problems here. I really feel like sometimes the themes they try to mix don't mesh too well and some of the emotional moments are awkward. There are some cheesed that-guy-should-have-died moments but they make up for it with some crushing that's-the-one-guy-I-didn't-want-to-die moments so it balances out I guess. I also was completely lost in the final fight scene. Like... What??? Huh??? Idk I can't go into detail cuz SpOiLeRz but it didn't really make sense. I don't like the comedy moments, they get on my nerves, and so does the way they're animated. The soundtrack honestly isn't particularly amazing, go ahead and beat me up idc. And sometimes the characters say some really bizarre stuff where I'm just like: 'Huh? Why? Do you have brain? Ooga Booga?' and the first two parts are a bit slow which takes away from the overall enjoyment. Those are my problems.
Despite MY problems with this show (emphasis on the my) it's really good. The philosophy behind it and the great story (which I gave a ten despite its shortcomings because it's just so dang genius) make it an anime absolutely worth watching. Is it the best? Eeeeeeehhhhhhh I'm sorry but I'm more of a ""Steins;gate"" man, and I honestly think a lot of people give ""Your Name"" a really hard time just because they don't like romance, but Fullmetal is still really good, definitely deserves the watch, so give it a shot and enjoy it to the max.

                this is probably my favorite anime. i'll preface this by saying i havent watched the original FMA anime (yet) so i cannot compare and instead just gonna focus solely on FMAB itself. 
FMAB has a really good plot. it certainly has its ups and downs but id say it's still consistently good until things get a little out of hand in the final part of the story. 
the world building is phenomenal, alchemy is nicely explained without going in too deep (*cough* hxh nen). the world is very interesting and while the plot is always good enough to stay in one place for a good
                  amount of time, it makes you want to see more of the worlds diversity all the time. 
again, its not all great and theres a bunch of unnecessary scenes as well as the dumbass ""meme animations"" (for a lack of a better word) in between. while i can easily live with some scenes that dont contribute anything to the plot, the caricaturesque scenes just make me cringe. it's not even remotely funny and it's hugely annoying if they keep repeating the same terrible jokes and memes over and over. the series has a lot of positivity and heartfelt moments in between a rather dark main plot. it wasnt at all necessary to try and ""lighten up the mood"" - if anything it destroyed the suspense and the ""feel"" there was to the show.
Moving on to the art i think the art is mostly brilliant. the fighting scenes arent the only aspect that makes the series shine in this category, the facial expressions, background etc. all look really nice. if youve watched the series and read my review so far you already know what i didnt like: yea the meme-cringe-scenes and their terrible artwork. moving on.
The sound is the only part of the series where id give a full 10/10. aside from one OP i think theyre all nothing short of amazing. the endings are great as well and i liked the voice acting, too. no complaints here - to be fair: judging the music is rather subjective. 
With the evaluation of the characters we are now entering the part where i had most of my concerns about the show in general. while i know a couple of people dont like ed and a lot of people do like al, for me its the other way round. i think al is almost always acting like a little baby - which is a stark contrast to what is happening around him. i think he doesnt fit the narrative. and while ed often goes on the borderline of that, al constantly crosses it sadly. 
luckily FMAB has a bunch of amazing villains as well as a couple of great side characters to make up for that. the homunculi in particular were really well fleshed out and they had more character development than basically ANY of those that confronted them. i liked envy and wrath a lot in particular, up to the point where i was actively rooting for them not to die. i would say this is good writing - but i'd also see the point if someone would say it is bad writing in the sense that the main characters are overshadowed too much. 
of the side characters the relationship between mustang and hawkeye obviously stands out - they have great synergy and its a bit of a shame this doesnt get explored more (no i dont mean shipping them necessarily). 
As for the enjoyment i had a lot of fun on that journey. i always wanted to see more, even the scenes that didnt particularly advance the story were good way more often than not. the xerxes-flashback episode was particularly great. 
all in all i'd say this is the closest to a masterpiece i've seen from anime so far, but not quite there yet. 9/10 with a tendency rather to 8 than 10.",9

                Overview:
It's strange that out of the two ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" anime series, ""Brotherhood"" is the one with the subtitle, because it should really be the other way round. This is because ""Brotherhood"" is the anime that faithfully adapts the original manga series written by Hiromu Arakawa, something that very much works in its favour. While the first ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" was certainly a great anime in its own right, there is much, much more to love about ""Brotherhood"". This is a better-written, more powerful, action-packed and enjoyable experience from top to bottom, and to call it a masterpiece would be an understatement.
Story & World (10/10):
No matter what
                  powers you may have, some things just can't be done. That's a lesson brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric learn the hard way when they try to resurrect their dead mother using Alchemy, a scientific process that revolves around creating something in exchange for something of equal value. However, resurrecting humans with such a process is regarded as a serious taboo, and for good reason. The experiment proves to be a colossal failure, as not only do they not bring back their mother, but Ed loses an arm and a leg, while Al loses his entire body, forcing Ed to bind his soul to a suit of armour in order to save his life. Now stuck in these forms, Ed and Al embark on a several-year quest to fix their mistake and get back what they lost- not their mother as they planned before, but simply their bodies. Of course, things prove to be far from simple, as not only do they have no idea to find what they need- a Philosopher's Stone, which supposedly has the ability to bend the rules of alchemy- but they soon find themselves in conflict with mysterious demonic beings known as Homunculi, who are plotting something extremely sinister that threatens to reshape the entire world.
While the setting of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", the country Amestris, is fictional, it is heavily inspired by early 20th century Britain and Europe. As far as anime go, ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" is on a whole other level when it comes to world-building, as we end up learning a ton about the country's history dating all the way back to its origins. The concept of Alchemy is explored immensely as well. To be brief, many of the Alchemists are employed by the government as high-ranking officials, and such Alchemists are known as State Alchemists. Edward is one such Alchemist, with Fullmetal Alchemist being his title. What truly separates him from most Alchemists, however, his brother included, is that while most Alchemists need a special symbol called a Transmutation Circle to use Alchemy, for Ed, using it is as simple as clapping his hands together, a power he gained as a result of being confronted by Truth, a supposed God of Alchemy that is believed by many to punish the arrogant. But honestly, as far Alchemy is concerned, I've barely only scratched the surface. When you hear someone say that anything can become anything in this series, they mean it. Throughout the series, you will see Ed, Al and others transmute everything from spears, swords, doors and even fire. It is a concept that is used to its fullest potential, and the series is much deeper and more original because of it.
As incredibly rich as the world-building is, however, the actual storytelling is just as good. While the series starts off very fast-paced, that's only because it's quickly going through things that were already covered in the first anime (with that in mind, I would recommend watching that series, or at least the first half, before you attempt this one). Once all of that is covered, things slow down a good deal to the absolute perfect pace, with things just consistently getting better and better with each passing episode. Everything makes sense, nothing is anti-climactic and things are almost never quite what they initially seem. The themes are plentiful and there are plenty of messages here that are not subtle at all, but absolutely need to be said. Once the series gets its momentum going, it never loses it, and tops off everything with one of the most rewarding, fitting and well-earned endings I have ever seen in any story, anime or not.
Art & Animation (9.5/10):
Even by Studio Bones standards, ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" is a fantastic-looking series, both for the time it was made and in general. The characters all look distinct and are masterfully drawn, the environments are equally brilliant-looking, the fight scenes are incredibly well-animated and choreographed and the various Alchemy visuals are an absolute joy to behold. There's a little too much deranged animation for my tastes, but this thankfully never distracts too much from the series and, better yet, it appears less and less as the series progresses. In particular, the final quarter of the series features some of the most gorgeous visuals I have ever seen, in animation or otherwise.
Sound & Dialogue (10/10):
There are so many great tracks in ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" that it is pretty much impossible to list them all. I honestly don't have a favourite part of the soundtrack for the simple fact that all of it is brilliant. That said, when it comes to particularly noteworthy tracks, the final two openings, ""Period"" and ""Rain"" come to mind. The voice acting, however, is even better; Vic Mignogna delivers an incredible performance as Ed that earned him several much-deserved awards, and the series in general boasts one of the finest dub casts ever assembled, including Travis Willingham as Roy Mustang, Maxey Whitehead as Al, Colleen Clinkenbeard as Riza Hawkeye, Caitlin Glass as Winry Rockbell, Monica Rial as May Chang, Todd Haberkorn as Ling Yao, Christopher Sabat as Alex Armstrong and many, many more. Ultimately, just about everything sound-wise is near-flawless, accompanied by a truly fantastic script, and this is just one of many reasons as to why I love this show so much.
Characters (10/10):
Edward Elric is an incredible protagonist, and calling him three-dimensional would honestly be putting it lightly. He starts the series as very immature and short-tempered (particularly in regards to this height) and while this is definitely hilarious, he tones it down a ton over the series, especially when things get very serious towards the end. Even at his worst, though, Ed is shown consistently to be very compassionate and extremely selfless; restoring his brother's body always takes priority over restoring his own and there's never any question that he's becoming what he's fighting against. Hiromu Arakawa could easily have written him as this ruthless person willing to do anything to restore his and his brother's bodies but she didn't and I applaud her for that. After all, part of the brothers' quest is atonement for thinking they could play God, which would be rendered meaningless if they were willing to become monsters. Ed's flaws instead lie in his belief that he can solve all of his problems with Alchemy and, more prominently, his guilt complex, which leads to him initially unwilling to accept help from anyone but Al, and that's largely because they share the same situation. Overtime, however, he learns to accept help from others and to share his burdens, as well as coming to terms with the fact that he is only human, which in turn allows him to forgive himself for his failures. In short, not only is he the single best character this anime has to offer (which is saying a LOT), he's one of the best anime characters ever conceived.
Al is, in many ways, the opposite of his brother. Where Ed is brash, short-tempered and eager for a fight, Al is kind, calm and pacifistic. He also hates to see anybody in pain and will go to great lengths to keep people from dying. However, while it's a lot harder to anger him than his brother, it's not impossible; he doesn't like people claiming it would be cool to have a suit of armour for a body, generally responding to such comments by saying they should be careful what they wish for. After all, while his armoured body does save him and his brother numerous times, it also means he can't eat, sleep or even feel the air around him. As such, he is notably more eager to have his own body restored than Ed is, even keeping a diary of things to eat when he has it back, though his brother's body is ultimately still his main priority. However, while Al is a fantastic character, one who I found myself liking even more is the brothers' commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Roy Mustang. Known as the Flame Alchemist, he has the ability to convert air into flammable gas using a Transmutation Circle on his glove, then lighting a fire to cause a huge burst of flames to attack. He's also a master tactician, deliberately acting much shallower than he actually is so that people don't take him too seriously. Not only is he one of the most badass characters in the series, he's also one of the most idealistic, having grand ambitions for Amestris that will very much benefit the people, in no small part thanks to his strong faith in humanity. These ambitions stem from a desire to make up for a terrible tragedy he took part in in the past, making him come off as a lot like the Elric brothers in this regard, but very different from them at the same time.
Another truly fantastic character is Riza Hawkeye, Roy's second-in-command and closest subordinate who lived through and was forced to do many of the same things he did. She's an incredibly loyal woman who would do anything for Mustang, yet also won't hesitate to remind him of his shortcomings or call him out when he goes too far, generally showing a no-nonsense attitude that hides her warm heart and desire to make up for her past actions, which is justified by the fact that she's a soldier. Plus, as her name implies, she's master marksman, with pretty much all of her best moments coming from her incredible aiming skills. Speaking of great female characters, there's also Winry Rockbell, a childhood friend of Ed and Al as well as the love interest of the former, and a highly skilled mechanic. She doesn't fight, but she still proves to be an invaluable asset to the brothers, both as emotional support and for the fact that she's the one to fix Ed's automail (artificial limbs that he wears in place of the ones he lost) whenever they get broken, which happens quite often, and you can expect her to be pissed whenever it happens. As a bonus, she's a huge geek for machinery, and I'd consider her to be a great character just for that.
As a whole, ""Fullmetal Alchemist""'s cast of characters is absolutely mind-boggling. Throughout the anime's 64 episodes, we're introduced to over 100 different characters, and by some miracle, most, if not all of them manage to be important. There's also plenty of strong connections between them, on top of the ones I've already mentioned, which really helps to reinforce the story's many themes. Even you don't like certain characters, you're not meant to. The Homonculi act very much like the sadistic, misanthropic demons they are, but even they all manage to have at least one sympathetic trait. The only real exception is the big boss, and trust me when I say that while you may enjoy the threat he delivers as an antagonist, and the great performance from the voice actor (whom I will not name to avoid spoilers), you will HATE him by the end of the series.
Enjoyment (9.5/10):
""Fullmetal Alchemist"" is a massively enjoyable series, having some of the most original fight scenes I've ever seen thanks to the many different uses of Alchemy. There's a ton of great comedy relief as well, whether it be Ed's comical overreactions, Winry's geeking over technology or Ling Yao's trolling among others. The only thing that stops this category from getting full marks is that it takes a bit too long to get to the good stuff, though when it does it will have been absolutely worth the wait, and as I mentioned earlier, things just get better with every episode, meaning you will absolutely want to see it to the end.
Overall:
Even more than a decade after its initial run, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" still stands as an absolute benchmark for all anime, making it hardly a surprise as to why calling it bad or even okay is such a sore spot in the anime community. There isn't a single aspect this series doesn't hit the nail on the head, from its amazingly well-developed characters, its fantastic visuals, its impeccable sound design (the voice acting, in particular), its brilliantly creative fight scenes to its incredible, deep story with a long list of powerful messages that only ""Dragon Ball"" could hope to match. This is easily one of the greatest shows I have ever seen and comes highly recommended to anyone who is unfortunate enough to have not watched it yet.

                An amazing story with an undying soul. The fullmetal Alchemist brotherhood has more of a theming that are not even cared by the children at the age of the characters in the show.  A carefully crafted characters and emotions make it to stand out as an anime and made itself be comparable to an epic. Yes, it is an epic and it is good. The Elric brothers are the most beautifully develo9ped protagonists among the five seasons or the 64 episodes long show. The show was paced too fast and it's predecessor paced too slow. It seems the series couldn't get rid of the
                  pacing problem that they are having. Except for that the brotherhood had a better ending than the original. Thus, making it a truly epic story for the anime p-latform..",8

                king of shounen.
everything was wrapped up perfectly. everything made sense. nothing felt out of place or unnecessary. very memorable. 
even the dub was amazing,
 moreover the female characters aren't treated like crap by the author (ahem like in Naruto) which probably has something to do with the mangaka being a woman. Unlike in other stories in battle shounen Fullmetal alchemist portrayed a romance between a man and a woman that didn't involve the woman also fighting, but in an equally useful role (mechanic) because other battle shounen (ahem naruto and bleach) just sideline them and make them useless in fighting anyway lol 
the story dealt
                  with some nice philosophical issues without going into territory the mangaka wasn't equipped to handle efficiently and with nuance (ahem attack on titan). 
The idea of ""alchemy"" as a power system was also very unique and memorable.",10

                There's nothing bad to be said about this anime
Personally, this anime will always be a masterpiece
When it comes to story, this anime is flawless. The depiction of the characters journey is uplifting and outstanding
Art is beautiful, amazing to view, amazing aesthetic wise, amazing all around
There's nothing much to say about the sound other than ""outstanding"" Characters are beautifully written and how they are adapted in this anime is amazing 
Enjoyment wise, this anime is one of the most enjoyable anime that I've watched in a while. Everything about this anime is enjoyable, there's nothing bad about this anime in general
Overall: 10/10. One of the best anime of all time.",10

                I think FMAb is a must-watch anime for the new comers. Because the story-telling, characters, animation, soundtrack, world-building in this show is insane. The alchemy concept is amazing and unique. I really like this show. And I would surely recommend this to all people who are eager to watch good anime. One other thing is that the characters are really likable and hilarious. Edward is just hilarious but also an amazing protagonist. But it's Roy Mustang my favorite. That guy is just on another level. Story - 10, Character Designs - 7, Animation - 9, Characters - 9, Soundtrack - 10, World-building - 8.5.
The pacing
                  can be a bit frustrating at the start but it takes time to shape a great show like this. And MAL keeps telling I have to write a longer review. I'm honestly Outta words.",9

                lings hot 
real review: 2003 / the manga is far better sorry not sorry, 
- I felt like they forced jokes into the more serious scenes when they WEREN'T supposed to be humours, 
- dumbed down the homunculus to ""grrrr we're evil and will follow father no matter what"" instead of how 2003 gave them personality by connecting them to humans, ofc that's not in the manga but still, was something i enjoyed, anyway this reviews about brotherhood, not 2003. 
- Roys character, I've always HATED roys character, he never treated edward well, ofc edward didn't want to be seen as a child and or
                  compared to one by roy, but roy went to fucking hard on edward, especially when they first met, one instance i can remember where he didn't wasn't hard on ed was when hughes died, only because roy was also feeling hurt. Then ed had to outright convince him to not kill envy, as if ROY was a child.
That's all for me 
9/10",9

                Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood gets great, but it has a sloppy start. The first 14 episodes of the anime were already adapted into a show before and so this version decides to go through those episodes at a fast pace so that we can get into the new stuff.
The bad news is a lot of iconic moments are rushed and some important characters and setting (like the coal mine and its workers) are mostly absent from this. The good news is they adapted the new stuff really well and so we can finally see some of the best moments in anime history in their full glory
Said
                  moments are brought to life by the top of the class animation that still impresses 10 years on and a great (but repetitive) soundtrack. But animation and soundtrack wise FMAB's greatest achievement are the ops.
Every anime franchise has that ONE op that sucks. FMA doesn't, sure some rock more than others but the entire package is filled with visual marvels 
However, none of that compares to the great cast. Ed is a great character and one of the few shounen protagonists that actually have a character arc. His brother Al is a great spin on the big guy with a secret heart of gold trophy and the supporting cast surrounding the brothers is amazing and everyone gets at least one chance to shine.
There are very few shows that deserve the title of classic, but FMAB is one of those few. Heartbreaking, exciting, funny, and many more things. This is a must-watch for anyone that likes regular series or anime",9
"
                I recently just finished Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood in a week from start to finish. I had high expectations going into this one as it currently sits as the #1 ranked anime on MAL. Initially, throughout the 1st and 2nd parts, I felt that the show was enjoyable to watch but I did not understand why it was the top-rated anime. I think in the beginning the pacing and story were a little bit boring at times. I didn't feel immediately invested in the story and especially the antagonists. 
Once I got to Part 3 of the series I felt that the characters started to really
                  shine. And ultimately I think the quality of the character's personalities and design makes the show as good as it is. I think that you combine that with a very good story and you've got a recipe for an excellent show.
Until the final 20 episodes or so, I would give this show a low 8. But the finale is very satisfying and I think the Homunculus started to become very cool and interesting villains towards the end. 
Overall I would give this show around an 8.7 but since there are not decimal scores on MAL I will settle for the 9. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in a fun adventurous series with very likable characters.",9
"
                First of all, I have seen the original FMA and although it was very popular and original, the pacing and conclusion did not sit too well with me. Brotherhood is meant to be a remake of the original, this time sticking to the manga all the way through, but there were people who thought it would spoil the franchise. That myth should be dispelled, as there's only one word to describe this series - EPIC.
I admit that as I've seen the original and read the manga, the pacing of Brotherhood seems to start off being VERY fast (I finally got used to the pacing after
                  watching the first fifteen eps or so). Events that took up half a volume of the manga and had spread though a few episodes of the original anime were now shown in just a single episode. However, after trying to look at it from the perspective of someone who's new to FMA (not comparing it to the manga nor the original), I believe that the pacing works and it manages to tell an intriguing story effectively with little confusion. The plot is full of clever ideas and unpredictable twists that link various parts of the story together. By the final episode, all loose ends are neatly tied up and what's left is a hugely satisfying epilogue.
The animation in FMA Brotherhood is crisp and very well done (although it does sometimes dip a bit in quality). Compared to the original FMA it's a bit simpler but that's just because the original set a very high standard to follow. The facial emotions of the characters are also perfectly presented. The action scenes are brilliant and VERY well animated, with a variety of alchemy techniques and other talents being displayed nearly every episode. The various battles are consistently exciting to watch, but somehow get even better towards the end of the series.
The voice acting is of an excellent and consistent quality, and I think that pretty much all the characters have voice actors which suit their personalities. The majority of the openings/endings are a pleasure to watch due to fantastic animated sequences and theme songs. The background music which play during the episodes usually fit very well with the situation, although some tracks seem to be overused a little at first. This becomes less of a problem as the series progresses, with plenty of new music being introduced to support the story as it reaches the finale.
Moving on to the characters (best thing about this series), the original FMA focussed mainly on Ed and Al and on their struggles to regain their bodies, whereas Brotherhood also explores other characters to great detail at the same time. The majority of the spotlight is still on the two brothers, but it highlights their interactions with new characters which were not present in the original anime. New characters include a group of people from Xing (a neighbouring country), another person from the Armstrong family (who I think has become one of the coolest members of the supporting cast), and a new main antagonist. For me, the Xingese characters in particular (Ling Yao and Mei Chang among others) provide a new dimension to the FMA world, by showing us a different culture to the militaristic one we're familiar with. I think the new antagonist is an improvement on the original FMA, as this person has a much stronger and clever link to the Elric brothers' father. Returning characters from the original FMA, such as Mustang and Scar, are much more awesome and developed due to the fact that Brotherhood is 100% faithful to the manga. Plus, Winry Rockbell now has a much more active role in the story. I can say for sure that this anime has one of the best main/supporting casts I've ever seen, and you'd probably find it difficult to label any of the recurring characters (whether they are good or evil) as being either boring or unnecessary in terms of the storyline.
One of the many good things about this series is that there has been absolutely no filler at all (yes, I'm thinking of Naruto, Inuyasha, etc), which prevents the story from losing momentum. All the episodes are concise and every scene is important as part of the huge plot. The dialogue fully explains everything and is straight to the point. As multiple characters are explored there are lots of side stories, but these are all perfectly intertwined with the main story of the Elric brothers and more often than not directly influence their journey too. Like most anime series, there are things from the manga which have been left out, but these are usually just restricted to comedy moments. There has been one episode which shows a lot of flashbacks of events so far, but that's forgiven as it shows the most epic moments of the series, and also provided us with some history on the father of the Elric brothers.
FMA Brotherhood will be sorely missed now that it's finished. It is excellent in every aspect and has very little, if anything, that can be called a flaw (maybe rushed character development at first due to the fast pacing, but this quickly subsides). Each episode feels like it's too short, a testimony to how much it draws you in to the story and characters. There are moments which leave you smiling, laughing, sad and simply amazed. Try this anime, it's recommended for absolutely everyone, to newcomers and to those familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist.",10

                10/10
FMA: Brotherhood was nearly flawless not only because of the amazing story but also because of memorable characters. You quickly become engrossed into this world as you learn about the characters, the struggles that they each go through and how they change. This spotlight isn't just reserved for the ""main"" character or even just the good guys but we are also informed about the ""bad"" guys and their struggles. I was truly unable to find a SINGLE character that I found boring, annoying or bland which tends to be true in every other anime.
The writer wasted NO time with insignificant fillers or ""fan service"". Every
                  single minute was the foundation for this great anime. The pace that the anime goes through is reminiscent of death note. Each and every episode is filled with thrill and suspense. You really can never expect what is going to happen and there are plot twists around every corner. This is NOT a ""typical"" shounen, beat-em up anime but instead is a cleverly written and exceptionally well executed one.
The ending is neatly tied up without a cliff hanger. I recommend this to EVERYBODY who has not seen it. If you have seen the 2003 anime, you could start at episode 14 which is when the story takes a turn",10
"
                Definitely, among the best anime I've watched. At this moment, one of the four titles that I've rated 10/10. And it might be because the other version (not Brotherhood) was so bad compared to this and influenced my opinion, who knows. Still, I'm not gonna change my opinion. This is a classic and it is worth watching. Whether you want to watch the other one is your own choice, you don't have to, but at least then you'll know how things went downhill in the second half, totally ruined the ending, sudden cut. Here, we get a lot more (sub)plot, characters, action, logic... Everything.
The magic/supernatural/powers
                  genres are definitely my favourite so if you like them too, give it a try. Well, on the other hand, if you like it I'd be surprised if you already didn't watch it. The overall plot is always what I appreciate the most, I hate when things are boring and I can't watch episodes anymore. Thank heavens, it's quite long but imanaging to be nteresting the whole time. Also, some very iconic soundtracks. Not hating on the art style, since everyone gets used to what they see after some time, it's old, but not bad. The most important is overall enjoyment and yes, I did enjoy it.
tldr; Watch this classic, it's one of the highest rated ones not without a reason.",10

--------------------------------
Before I begin my review I need to advise you to watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood it is definitely worth your time trust me.
Story 9: The story of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a must-watch for anyone that wants to or already started watching anime. It builds on a sad story of two brothers determined to get their bodies back and turns into a story of despair.
Art 10: The art included in this anime was ahead of its time with the alchemy and the godly figures featured in the anime
Sound 10: The sound is what I believed made this anime with it being played by an
                  orchestra it builds the perfect atmosphere for this story. The soundtrack featured in this does such a great job building despair for the atmosphere that while listening to the soundtrack for this review my heart just sunk.
Character 10: The characters in this anime did a great job building an emotional connection with the person watching. Which in term build great scenes of tension where you would be wondering whether on not your favorite character would die. And unlike other big series like AOT the characters are not only there to cannon fodder they all have their own scenes to build connections with them or build hatred or fear of them.
Enjoyment 10: This piece of art with its amazing soundtrack paired with its amazing characters, and the story makes for a really enjoyable experience that is almost unforgettable and is a must-watch for anybody that enjoys anime",10

                This is my first review and i figure this would be a good place to start. Brotherhood is great however one thing many people don't look at is if you didn't see the original some of the story doesn't make any sense there are parts that Brotherhood jumps right over since they assuming you have seen the original still very enjoyable but something new comers defiantly must know so that they don't lose out on enjoying a great story. My scores that i have given for this anime are low only due to the fact that there is more information in the original and not
                  because the story or characters are sub par. thank you for taking the time to read my Review.",8

                This is a very good show, but it was still disappointing because I started the show thinking it would be a masterpiece, seeing as it is ranked #1 in MAL and so highly praised by so many people. Here is all the places I thought the anime felt off.
**SPOILER ALERT**
-> I dont understand why it started from a random point in the timeline with episode 1 and then episode 2 onwards it starts it for real. Its a bit weird.
-> Episode 10 : Hughes was starting to put the pieces together, so Lust was sent to assasinate him. But she failed to do so in
                  the first try and Hughes manages to escape her. But after managing to leave the room what does he do? You would expect him to go to somewhere populated in the office or maybe call out for help. But no, he does the opposite of that actually. He wanted to make a phone call to Mustang and inform him about the recent developments. He could have done that call from the office, but for some mysterious reason he thought it was better to leave the office and go to a phone booth in the middle of nowhere. 
  One way to explain this could be that he thought that many in the military were traitors so staying in the office will be worse. But this is not true since he said that he should inform Bradley about the recent developments before. Which means he did not know that all of the higher officials were corrupted yet.
  Another explanation could be that since he had planted a knife right in the head of Lust he thought he was dead and thus did not call out help. But that is still not good enough explanation of why he had to leave the office as there were telephones in there as well. Not like there were no telephones nearby and he HAD to leave the office. 
So this was a big weakness of the plot in my opinion
-> Episode 17, there was no reason for Barry to free Ling, just because he was a foreigner.
->  Throughout the series Ling and also May Chang seek immortality. It says that somehow that will help their clan, help them become rulers etc etc. But there was no clarification on this matter till the end. It makes no sense to me why both of them were strangely searching for immortality.
-> We know that Bradley became the king and manipulated all the higher officials of the military. But how did bradley infiltrate the military in the first place. How did he manage to become the king? There is no explanation to that in the show
-> Why did Van Hoenhan have to leave his kids and go away. I find no good explanation for this throughout the series. It is evident that he cared for his family and kids plenty. Yet for some reason he left. It said in the anime that he conversed with all the souls inside him and sorted them. But that has nothing to do with leaving home.
-> Episode 46: Winry asks why Elric doesn't go see Al at the station, and the reason given was that he was a fugitive so he does not want to go. I dont think there is any connection between being a fugitive and not going to meet his brother after such a long time.
-> Episode 51: Al came up with a brilliant plan of trapping Pride in darkness to remove him until the end of the fight. It happened successfully too. After getting trapped Pride kept hitting Al's head for the whole night. He was signalling his location, but Al was unaware of it. Now I can understand that he did not know that Pride was signalling his location, but still, creating that annoying noise throughout the night, at least he could have not let him make that annoying sound. In the morning when he was asked why he allowed him to make that sound continuously, his reply was that Selim was a little kid so he was just playing. When he knew full well that Selim was no kid.
-> The show always kept saying ""Human transmutation is a taboo, for what could be the value of a human being"". And finally guess what was used as equivalent exchange to bring Al back to life. It was that Elric could never use alchemy again. Seriously, thats all it takes to do human transmutation. Something that lost Elric 2 of his limbs and Al his whole body and still was not equivalent to bring their mother back to life, it took only the sacrifice of never to use alchemy again to do the same thing at the end of the show. This really made me hate the ending.
 You could say that unlike their mother Al was not dead, but trapped inside that weird dimension of truth. The price was only to take him back to the human realm. Yea, thats an explanation, but I still dont think that it is satisfying enough.
That was all the points I disliked about the show. Feel free to message me if you feel like having a conversation. Thanks.",8

                This anime has executed well in almost all the elements, the story, the story progression, the enjoyment, the characters' depth. GOAT of anime. 
I remember watching this without the influence of social media, it still hyped me, the story is unique, sci-fi + shonen + action + suspense + idealism. The music and OST of the anime is great too, knowing that this has been produced last decade, I'm still amazed on how they executed this anime and turns out to be a success.
The art is also great and the characters, they were fully unique and embodies a depth of story not just to be
                  aesthetically appealing.",10
"
                A series with a very well worked history. With a beginning that little by little warns you of everything that is coming, with a development that advances at a decent but elaborate pace that allows you to enjoy all the problems throughout all its episodes. And as a end, an ending that manages to close the story very well and with the desire to continue.
Good characters (both main and secondary, protagonists and antagonists), very good plot, good soundtrack, decent animation and a significant and considerable amount of enough chapters to enjoy everything it offers. Definitely a masterpiece like no other. A jewel of the anime.

                [WARNING FOR SPOILERS ON FIRST PARAGRAPH]
I binged FMA:B after binging the 2003 FMA adaptation, and while I fell in love with both adaptations, there's a couple things I missed.
I personally LOVE 2003's twist of Mustang being the one who killed Winry's parents, and honestly, to me, it just sounds so much more realistic as a show that shows a bit about how people like him are able to do anything under orders. I feel like in Brotherhood (although probably in the manga canon as well, haven't gotten to it yet) he's made to seem more like just an awful person than a vigilante. I missed
                  the whole Dante storyline a bit, since I thought she was just an amazingly written villain. I also feel the whole ongoing joke of Ed being short gets really tiring after the first 10 times (or whatever) it's mentioned.
However, in Brotherhood, I find it very beautiful how Hohenheim is portrayed in a much more humane way, instead of the somewhat selfish man desperate for eternal life we see in 2003.
Brotherhood's animation is simply a delight compared to 2003's, however, I personally think 2003's soundtrack is much more elaborate and entrancing.
Basically, I think both have great parts to them. However, 2009 feels much less terrifying and serious than 2003, which is something I missed a bit. Humor is sometimes used in situations where I think it wouldn't be needed, but I believe for younger viewers, it must be a breath of fresh air.
tl;dr both are great and have their own good parts!",8

                ""What could equal the value of a human soul?"" 
Fullmetal Alchemist asks this question, and does not give a definite answer. Many different characters put different values on a human soul, yet none of them have the correct value. When our protagonists, Edward and Alphonse Elric attempt to put a value on a human soul through alchemy, it causes the Edward to lose his arm and leg, and Alphonse to lose his entire body, they must set out on a journey to restore their bodies, unknowing on how they can accomplish such a feat.
The only issue I have with brotherhood is that it does not
                  include the coal mine town episode, which in the manga and 2003 version of the show, displays an interesting aspect of Edward Elric's character, how he has a selfless streak.",10

                Legendary status is what this anime has. I honestly don't know why I am even bothering to write up a review on this, other than to save the poor souls who settled on the regular version of Fullmetal Alchemist when they were younger.
This right here is what you have been waiting for! You don't read manga, but you can appreciate movies that stick exactly to the written source material? Well, here you go! I wish more anime and other media would follow in Fullmetal's steps. 
Imagine a world that directors didn't put they own ""personal"" twist on everything. 
Imagine a world that didn't have shows
                  and movies cut stupidly short to fit a half hearted story in.
Imagine WATCHING an audio book. 
This is the perfect anime to get someone to START their anime addiction. I have seriously gotten bro's and ladies in their late 30's and 40's to start watching anime (THEY CHOSE THE BLUE PILL FINALLY) just from watching this show in its entirety. 
If you are here because you finally got out from under your rock, and heard they remade a cherished childhood show that you caught on Adult Swim, OR you are just starting down this path of anime media, this is your first stop. 
WELCOME FRIEND!",10

                I have never in my life written a review for a show or anything. This is my first time ever so cut me some slack.
I have been watching anime for a really long time. Precisely for 7-8 years, and i have seen a lot of good shows and bad shows. 
When i came across myanimelist.net lont time ago, i went to the top anime to get some good recommendations. Reaching that place i saw Full Metal Alchemist brotherhood.
I watched it and, wow! I was happy that my eyes witnessed such a show. The world building to the character development, openings to the animation, and the
                  plot was just over the top.
I would love to tell you why this was soo good.
Our 2 main character Edward and Elric are brothers on a journey to find a philosopher stone to regain their lost limbs and body. They go through hardships and struggles but finally in the end get, i wont spoil.
The villains were some of the best i had ever seen, [Spoiler Warning?] like for expample the lizard guy, and his death was extremely sad, i had never cried for a villains death but this made me cry.[Spoiler Finished]
I love anime where we have a simple goal but it turns into something else entirely. Fmab is about that, and it does that beautifully. 
So if youre looking for the best anime ever, watch this.

                There's not too much to say about this anime that hasn't been said already, but I did want to share my opinion on it regardless as someone who went in with high standards and was already aware of the rating of this show beforehand. 
In terms of the pros and cons of this anime, the pros are: Very compelling, thought out, and unique story. It doesn't have many holes in it (none that matter, anyway) and the pacing is pretty close to perfect. It's pretty fast pace at times, especially in the beginning, but it remains to be that perfect balance of not too fast-paced
                  and not too slow. The characters are all pretty likable for the most part and some have more character development than others. The soundtrack is amazing and definitely help to create and amplify the atmosphere of the scenes in the show. The ending is fantastic, and the story wraps up without leaving any important loose strings. I also love the fact that it doesn't go the typical shounen all-powerful kid route and instead opts for a story in which the protagonist and people around him really aren't that powerful compared to the villains (with one exception) and so it doesn't just come around to deus ex machina bs. Instead, it uses actual strategy and plot progression to deal with the antagonists. 
Now for the cons; I honestly hated the comedy throughout this show. It was extremely repetitive and often cringeworthy, which I could forgive, if it wasn't for the fact that these comedy scenes often take place in the middle of what should be SERIOUS scenes. There's plenty of examples of this that you'll see throughout the show, but the creator clearly does not understand when there should be comedy and when there shouldn't be. I understand not wanting the to take itself too seriously, but when you implore serious and thought-provoking scenes and then have a random burst of comedy it just makes the seriousness less serious, giving viewers a strange mood-whiplash. The story was also pretty boring at times, and I don't think it has anything to do with being slow paced, as it's not. Certain arcs of the story just simply don't have much interesting going on and it led to me just being straight up bored throughout large parts of the show leading up to the climax. The main 2 protagonists were also just...alright? I don't have any real dislike for them but nothing about them was all that interesting to me. Edward, to me, doesn't seem to have much of any 'development'. He was already incredibly remorseful for what he did in the beginning and also realized that humans can't come back and he was foolish to try and play god. In the end, it seems that rather than developing he just came to a sudden realization. Alphonse is just simply a young, loveable and sweet child but that's pretty much all there is to say about him. The father (both the antagonist and the father of ed) are definitely the most interesting characters to say the least. 
Overall, I still really enjoyed this show and thought it lived up to the hype for the most part. It feels really complete and just all around a great story. I wouldn't say it was groundbreaking or a 'masterpiece', though. I don't know if this show is really a 9 but I'm going more off of the words use to describe the numers, with 9 being a 'great' and I do feel that this show is great.",9

                FMAB review by Rfonzx (potential spoilers!)
FMAB. This anime is WIDELY KNOWN around the world for being the number one anime on MAL. 7/14 is the date when I've finally decided to watch FMAB. Why, you said? because I wanted to know the reason why does this anime gets the number one spot on MAL. It took me like 14 days to complete the whole 64 episodes of it. I'd consider it a binge watch, since I usually don't watch anime at a consistent amount of rate. And now, here I am, making a review about this anime. 
(disclaimer: this is my first time making an
                  anime review, and there's gonna be a POTENTIAL SPOILERS here on the review!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
Plot : 9.5/10
At first, I thought the plot of FMAB would be way more superior than the cast. But I was 100% sure that I was wrong back then. But that doesn't mean that the plot was bad, it was good. The pacing of this anime is fine, you just gotta pause the certain confusing part of the episode to make sure that you don't miss anything. The first 50 episodes are good, but the last 14 episodes are definitely the best part. It was like a roller coaster of emotion, there are times when you feel like you're gonna bawl your eyes out, and there are times when you feel a heartwarming feelings in you.
Art (Sound and animations)
For the sound, it was definitely a 7.75. It was nothing special, but it sure does the job, especially at the last few episodes, it was done thoroughly. For the opening and endings, my favorite openings are the 5th one while my favorite endings are the 4th one. Animation-wise, it was around a 8.5-9. Some of the fight scenes are very well made and I found nothing (about the animation) that bothers me.
Cast : 9.75
So basically the Elric Bros are the main attention of the cast. Their character journey throughout the anime is beautifully made, especially at the 60-64th episode. That's basically their whole character conclusion. The way Ed overcomes his hardships throughout the series and then finding out what was the true meaning of the ""truth"" really is was defo the peak moment on the anime. 95% of the cast serves a huuuugeee role on the plot. They were made for a necessary purposes. And almost every one of them are well written (IMO the best written characters on this anime are Scar, Hohenheim, and Edward). FMAB's cast is definitely one of the best cast that I've ever seen. (This cast is in my opinion slightly better than AOT's)
Enjoyment: 9.75/10
Well, my enjoyment for the series would be a 10 if only I didn't get spoiled. But it was   very enjoyable nonetheless.
Overall: 9.5/10
Overall, this anime satisfied myself in almost every aspect (except the sound, it didn't fulfill my expectation very well). My predicted rating for the series before I watched the whole thing is actually a 10. I would never expect it to be a 9.5, but you know what? 9,5 is still a high rating. 
Well, now I know why does this anime is the best-rated anime on MAL. It 100% deserves the rating, cause it's a great anime to watch and I had a great journey watching it. It's not the best anime ever made, though. There are a few animes that are better than FMAB (Like Eva, AOT, and ASV). But it doesn't mean that FMAB is not worth the watch just because it isn't the best anime ever made.  If you haven't seen the anime yet, then you're truly missing out! It deserves the watch!!
Thank you for taking your time reading my first review =)",9

                I've put off writing a review for this show a lot of times. It's one of the best reviewed and most praised anime of all time, currently sitting at #1 on MAL. And I felt conflicted on this since I started watching it, so I think I'm just gonna say what I feel and try not to think too much about it.
First of all, the things I liked: I actually thought that alchemy was an interesting as fuck concept and that it was really well implemented in the story. And that was probably my favorite thing in the show, the story. I liked all the
                  twists and turns that it took and how everything slowly unravels. 
The animation was also really good, and the artstyle really fit the tone and world the story took place in.
But I didn't like everything in it, and that's where the problems started forming for me, the story didn't really balance well the attention that it gave to some plot points compared to others. Like Nina for example, for such an important part of the story and the main characters' motivations, I think that it could have used one more episode to develop, since two scenes of them playing together wasn't enough to build a connection with me, which led me to fell nothing when the thing that happens to her happened.
Which brings me to the thing that I probably liked the least in FMAB, the characters, I think that most of them (with the exception of Edward, Alphouse and Hohenheim) weren't that well developed and I didn't care for a lot of them. Especially the villians, since most of them get ""last minute development"".
Another thing that I had issues with was the pacing, since the show slows down at the middle and I felt really bored when watching it (but I think that that was more of a me problem).
And also the comedy sometimes outstayed its welcome.
However, what saved this show from being a 7/10 for me, were those 2 last episodes, because I absolutely adored them, everything was wraped up nicely and I ever cried a bit ngl.
So I think that’s it, I like this show, the story is interesting, but a lot of the times it failed to keep me invested (especially in Briggs), and the characters were not that amazing for me. But the strong ending, and interesting concepts make me think that this is a solid 8/10 in my eyes.
Thank you so much for reading through this entire thing! It really was hard for me to write this since it is my first review, and I really wanted to like this as much as everyone else xd. But I didn't, and that's ok.",8
"
                What I like: 
It's great to watch all the pieces move around and come together. I really REALLY like that it takes it slow but once everything starts to fall into place it gets very good. 
What I don't like: 
The fights are okay it's pretty much only talking then at the end it's pretty much Edward being a good boy and honorable it just doesn't do it for me. 
The characters are pretty rigid they don't change too much they do change however it's not by much Edward doesn't change a lot from the beginning to the end. When people do change like Scar
                  it's pretty tame and by the books and predictable the same for Winry
Overall it's great it ticks a lot of boxes for me",8
"
                This anime was the first anime I watched and I was confused in the first episode I watched it, I didn't understand what was happening, but the more I watched it got better and it immersed me in action scenes.
It makes the scenes even more beautiful and gives you a beautiful drawing that reflects and feels the action.
  As for the sound, the actors seem to be complemented by good characters, we can say that the characters' voices help to understand the personal characteristics of the characters, and after watching the anime, we came to the best part. The music made me addicted, I
                  kept listening and I couldn't give up, but other opening songs are not as good as their first music, but not bad either.
Let's move on to the characters, I think we can say that the characters are legendary when the personalities of the characters are combined with very beautiful illustrations and one of the best animations comes out. , ingenious voiceovers and moreover a masterpiece story, reactions and friendly personalities. From the main character to the supporting character, these anime characters seem to have been subtly studied, but the illustrations do not stand out.
I think he should watch an anime, my score for this anime is 9, I broke the scores because nothing is perfect.",9

                Post Series Depression: ~1
Tear Factor: ~1
Laugh Factor: 6.5
Drama Factor: ~3
Character Attachment: ~7 - 9
Story: Very on track with no fillers or sidetracks from the main plot, and very easy to follow all the way through up until around the ending portion of the series in terms of the complexity.
Art: Can be very playful or very serious depending on the tone/mood of the scene. but overall it is pleasant to view.Sound: Nothing too special or unique, but not low in quality either.
Characters: Each one brings their own angle onto the entire series and fits into place perfectly. Each character is very well thought out.
Enjoyment: I'd say it's enjoyable, especially if you're looking for something with a scientific alchemy vibe that runs like HxH or Naruto (without fillers).
Overall: I'd have to say this one is high up on the charts - it is medium to long length though so buckle up for a long watch.",9
"
                Visual and pacing
Clear visuals, pacing is tad bit slow for personal taste but comparative to other anime, it's good. Animation quality is very consistent, lowest looks good, best looks amazing. Fantastic imagery and depiction of the world of Amestris. Many different cultures, architectures, and nature and cities. 
+1.8 (Pacing could be a bit faster)
Sound and Voice acting
Voice acting is phenomenal both English and Japanese. Characters really deliver the emotions through the voice. Pain, anguish, suffering, disgust, hatred are highlights of the voices. There are also some loving and emotional lines that are also delivered very well. Sound effects never distract from the story, almost always
                  enhances every element of the visuals. Some emotional OSTs and many triumphant OSTs, that are recognizable but they all blend in together. Some good openings and endings, few of the songs are very memorable. 
+1.5 (Nitpick, it's just OST is very cohesive and maybe that made it less memorable)
Theme and story
There are multitude of themes, at the top of my head there is theme of what is lost can't be replaced, the war soldiers and the consequences, hatred breeds hatred, the value of individual life and the foolishness of grandiose self serving thoughts, etc. The overall plot of the FMA has story of the Elric brother as the focus but there are many other stories as well, Roy Mustang and his revenge against the homunculus, Scar and his story of redemption, the many B plots all have very satisfying conclusion and all culminates towards the finale of the story. The mystery and secret plots from the villain, as well as hidden plot moving behind the scenes by the protagonist groups, many things to speculate, even just the philosopher's stone. The plot twist of how fundamental of how alchemy was performed, what is needed for philosopher's stone, who are the true villains completely changes the perspective of these character interactions happen early on in the story. 
+4 (Full points, perfect)
Art Style
The character design is already tells quite an interesting story between Alphonse and Edward and their dichotomy, as well as this does get addressed as the story progresses. The art style stands right in middle of cute and handsome, and characters can be put into this wide spectrum of style, and most characters can give clear expressions ranging from happy/silly/cute expressions to serious/solemn/cool. Very adaptable style befitting of a long series that has extremely large range of stories to tell, and wide range of emotions to convey. 
+0.8 (In brotherhood I felt there were some misused art style queues, too many goofy moments)
Value to rewatch 
There are so many things going on you are bound to have missed subtle details and interaction, as well as plot twist reveals changing the viewer's perspective. Definitely worth the rewatch and more careful analysis. 
+1 (Mostly carried over from perfect story elements)
Personal Interest
It was very interesting from episode 1 of 2003, not so much in brotherhood unfortunately. If we combined the experience then it gets full marks. 
+0.5 (Comparatively 2003 first episode was very strong unlike brotherhood)",10
"
                I just rewatched it and ooh boy it aged badly. First episodes feel rushed. Every plot point starts and ends in a single episode, propably due to repeating same content that was in the original series. That just removes all the emotional connection and impact those scenes should have. On the other hand the middle section of the series moves way to slow. Everything is stretched, full of fillers, terrible jokes and uniteresting dialogues. I understand the purpose of down time between action but sometimes it takes far too long. Also some characters are just utterly boring even if they are useful in the story.
                  I cant give a 9 or a 10 to a series in which I skip scenes and skip some stuff I did.",8
"
                I think it is a little bit overrated, but very good for real :D I fucking enjoyed this anime bro so for real..
The story is interesting and unique.
Art for a 2009 anime is good i think.
Sound is not that special.
The best part in the show is the characters, i can say just ONE anime who has the best side character (I mean Writing,enjoyment etc...)this is the ""One Piece"" of course. The character here in this show is incredible, i mean they writed edward,Elric, Hoheinheim, Mustang, Yao, Armstrong family, and more..
The villains is just AHH i loved them, i loved the main enemy and the other
                  for example: Envy, Bradley, Selim and more :D
So for overall the character it is just 10/10 :D
I cant say anything special the enjoyment for me is 10/9
Overall 10/9 :D

                This is a fantastic adaption of the manga storyline. When it comes to writing about large topics inside tiny tales, Arakawa is a master. Fullmetal Alchemist is, at its heart, a narrative of two brothers who are learning to mourn and grow up together. The serious topics of what it means to be alive in life beyond death are handled delicately and expertly subverted throughout the show. The program's type of alchemy is used often enough to make it a wonderful action show, but it does not get in the way of the plot, which is excellent. The plot and the characters are the ones
                  that have the power in the program, not the other way around. This is an excellent anime for anyone who is interested in topics about their purpose in life as well as the hereafter. 
A recurring topic in the program, grief, is not overplayed or pounded to death (haha). There are many humorous moments in the program, and the characters who are presented in the anime are so well-written that we, as viewers, get emotionally concerned in the fate of each character.
Some of the show's disadvantages, on the other hand, include the fact that the surface plots get complicated. In addition, the explanation and application of alchemy in the program might be a little unclear at times. However, one positive aspect of the writing is that the people and their adventures are depicted so beautifully that the confused power relations may be overlooked. Overall, this is a fantastic program that serves as an excellent introduction for those who wish to watch more serious anime.",10

                FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST BROTHERHOOD: A TIMELESS MASTERPIECE
1) INTRODUCTION:
I picked my words carefully here, because it's far from my favorite anime, it's not even in my top 5, but it's a brilliantly built show
This masterpiece of an anime literally has everything, deep themes and philosophies, characters each of which have their own backstory, beliefs and goals who stay relevant to the end, whether it would be the good guys or the bad guys, an intricate storyline and one of the best and most satisfying endings in all of anime, an amazing power system that actually makes sense and the power scaling doesn't become garbage, good fights, superb
                  animation/art style and great music.
Now let me explain how fmab excels in these categories.
2) THEMES:
I'll be brief here since I'm just gonna list the prominent themes within the story and not expand on them since I'll do so in the other categories.
Essentially, other than your typical generic themes like hard work, friendship and never giving up, fmab masterfully tackles three themes and expands on them in detail, and they are:
- Human nature
- Evolution
- God
3) CHARACTERS:
Without a doubt, the best aspect in fmab, all the characters are so amazingly written and actually stay relevant in the end and not just become sidekicks for the main characters, all the while strengthening the show's themes and depictions. Let me give you examples
1- The theme of human nature is very prevalent in arakawa's characters such as:
-Kimblee who's a clear depiction for power corruption and what happens when power is given to the wrong person
-Bradley who's sole purpose in life is to find a good fight to the death, and he'll do anything to get it, just like every greedy person in our world
-Hohenheim who's someone simply struggling to make human connection, thus fails in his life as a father, a husband, and human being
-Scar who wants revenge more than anything else with a justifiable reason to do so
-Hawkeye, yes, someone as earnest as she is can in fact reflect the dark truth behind humans, it turned out that even Hawkeye finds enjoyment and satisfaction in shooting ishavalens
2- The theme of evolution is as prominent as that of human nature, here are characters who strengthen it
-Greed whose development is just amazing, as his name implies, he always wanted everything the world has to offer, yet what he truly wanted was the cheapest thing to have yet the hardest item to gain, he simply wanted friends, and after making this self-realization, he exhibited the least greedy act possible, he sacrificed his life to save his friends
-Scar who really surpassed my expectations after rewatching fmab, his development is actually fascinating, he just needed another perspective in life, and when he found that in miles, he started his development, to end up helping the very nation he swore to destroy
-Envy whose self-realization at the end and the fact that he finally understood that humans are in the same level as homunculi was just amazingly written
3- God
This theme is always fascinating to witness, seeing how every anime tries to depict God's existence in different manners, whether it would be Steins gate's depiction of the complete lack of a god given that normal humans are doing acts only God can do, conveying the message that there is no god, or the depiction of code geass of God being the thoughts, memories and emotions, or in fmab, in which Arakawa depicts God as the accumulation of all knowledge, truth, or put simply, god in fmab is ""all"", everything.
And the character that greatly strengthens this theme is none other than father, he just wanted freedom, but the sad reality is that no matter how much he escaped the flask he was put in, he'll always be trapped in another bigger flask, one can't obtain everything, so father's attempt at absorbing God was bound to fail before it even started.
4) STORY:
What can I say about fmab's story that isn't already said really. The storyline is just as close to perfection as you can possibly get. Having one of the best endings in all of anime, the journey the brothers went on felt real and the victory in the end just felt so damn satisfying and earned.
The first half of the anime served as a good introduction to the world, themes, concepts and characters and those first 30 episodes were solid, it was an 8/10 so far
But then, the Briggs arc happened and only then did it start deserving the hype it gets. Not only did this arc expand the world and introduce new great characters like kimblee and armstrong, it also answered many questions about the world, lore, and the past of some characters, like really, episode 30 (the ishvalen war) and episode 40 (hohenheim's past) are among my favorite episodes in the entire series
And all that build-up culminated in one of anime's best War arcs to date, the battle of central, my 5th favorite arc in all of anime, this is where we truly see Arakawa shine as a writer, her handling of the homunculi and how she masterfully executed their deaths, with each one being ironic seeing what their sin is, is just fascinating
5) FIGHTS/POWER SYSTEM:
I'll keep it brief here, the power system's great and the fights are really awesome, Bradley vs scar is one of my favorite fights in all of anime, both on a superficial level and on a thematic level, the fights are a visual treat
6) THE ADAPTATION:
Bones really took the adaptation into the next level with fmab, everything regarding the adaptation is great. The animation and art style are awesome, the music is just on point especially the dramatic soundtracks, and the openings and endings are also great, in fact ""rain"" op 5 and ""let it all out"" ed 2 are respectively my favorite opening and ending in all of anime
7) SOME MINOR FLAWS:
Nothing in fiction is perfect, that's a fact. You can nitpick and find mistakes in every fictional story ever. However, the amount of flaws is what matters here. And personally I can't find but two flaws in fmab
1-The beginning is a bit stiff and slow, at least compared to the madness in the second half of the show
2-The comedy is just terrible, especially in the beginning, it's forced, artificial, and it just ruins the moment. 
Like for example, in episode 9, Al blames Ed for what happened to his body and accuses him of faking his memories, and winry overhears them and then talks to Al to tell him how wrong he is, the moment was really touching, seeing winry cry and the music in the background gave off that feeling too, only for Al to make that stupid face expression and ruin the whole moment.
Of course that's without mentioning the joke that forms 90% of fmab's comedy that gets old after 3 episodes literally, and the ""joke"" goes like this:
- Ohh the fullmetal alchemist is here points at al
- ummm actually it's my brother
- what you mean that little kid is the fullmetal alchemist?!
- WHO YOU'RE CALLING LITTLE?!!!
EVERY time rinse and repeat like it really got old
8) CONCLUSION:
As I said, that's just my subjective take on the matter and why I think fmab is the greatest anime ever. Thanks for reading",9
"
                FMAB is one of the most famous shows on this site, having held the #1 spot for quite some time, and after having watched it in its entirety I definitely can see why. I don't personally think its my favorite show, but I can definitely see why a large majority of people do. It manages to weave a long and interesting narrative through all 64 of its episodes. When so much of the modern anime scene is dominated by 1 cour shows, it can be nice to see a larger scale narrative like AOT or FMAB, they have more time to develop and set up
                  the story, leading to a much more satisfying narrative conclusion. Of course problems can arise within longer narratives: the larger amount of space can lead to lengthy filler portions in works with poorly planned or paced narratives, lengthy plots can sometimes become complicated and convoluted, or they can just end up being too damn long for you to ever want to finish. FMAB is the definition of a well executed longer-form narrative, and its 64 episodes are all worth the time investment to reach its conclusion.
The plot woven through those 64 episodes is definitely my favorite part of FMAB, because of how well it fills its runtime. The pacing is sublime, starting comfortably slow as the characters slowly uncover the plot and basic characters, elements, and setting are set up and established. The first chunk of the show is at this slow pace, as Edward and Alphonse go on small adventures dealing with relatively small scale problems as the bigger plot is teased more and more until part of its revealed in a big sub-climax and the stakes are raised and the pacing is sped up. This formula is then continued all the way up until the finale, where all of the elements come together in a super epic climax that ends the long journey with a satisfying conclusion. FMAB also has its own fair share of interesting plot twists throughout its runtime, while none of them are anything as crazy as what's in AOT, they all keep the plot fresh and interesting to make sure our heroes aren't just following the same exact goal for the entirety of the series. Bones did a great job with their execution of the plot and it is easily the strongest part of the series.
FMAB also carries a great sense of humor along with it in addition to its fantastic story. I found the jokes decently funny and they were great at easing the tension in the moments in the show when Ed and Al weren't fighting for their lives against incredibly powerful enemies. Humor is obviously even more subjective then other aspects of an opinion on a series, but personally I liked a good majority of the jokes  in the series and found them to be a refreshing break from the rest of the action and drama that populates FMAB.
Second to the story, my next favorite element would have to be the characters. While I don't think they are a masterclass in character writing, I believe they all feel a bit grounded and relatable in some way. Their are plenty of valid arguments as to why they aren't good because of things like being defined by trauma or wearing their goals on their sleeve, I don't think they are necessarily bad characters for those traits. While sometimes a character can feel like just existing to die in a dramatic fashion, if I still enjoyed that character and their death impacted me, then I say its fine. Their are plenty of really blatant examples of ""tear-baiting"" characters as I am going to call them and I feel that FMAB isn't really one of those blatant examples. With one exception, I think pretty much every tear-baitey character in the show has some other reason to exist other than just getting a reaction out of the audience when they die. They are more developed and well rounded than characters that exist literally just to die. I ended this series enjoying a majority of the characters and I think that overall they did a pretty good job in their execution of them.
The art of FMAB was definitely one of its more weaker aspects, it was far from anything even resembling bad, but it was definitely one of the most average feeling aspects of the show. The overall style feels pretty generic barring some character designs. It wasn't something that detracted from the viewing experience, but it didn't add anything too special.
The music definitely fairs much better. The show has some good OP's and ED's for one (except for the bad ones) and has some quite memorable tracks played throughout the series. I don't know if its just because they were played throughout a 64 episode series that I have some of them engrained in my memory, but they are memorable all the same. The tracks are all well suited to the show and its style and setting, and exercise great control over the tone and feel from scene to scene.
FMAB is definitely one of the great shows in the vast medium that is anime. It is not personally one of my favorites, but I think it is a great example of what a shounen anime can be given time, effort, and sufficient development. I can totally see why it has received so much praise and will probably continue to for some time. I enjoyed my time watching this show and can firmly recommend it to basically anyone who likes anything even closely resembling the shounen genre.",9

                Story:
Thrilling pacing with an addictive flow. It is a beautiful blend of simplicity and complexity which carries over well from the manga. There's plenty of meat to get one's teeth into and yet it doesn't overload the mind, and it represents its somewhat complex dynamics in a highly effective and clear way.
Art:
Consistently very good with no jarring sequences and many truly splendid battles filled with scintillating direction and dynamism.
Sound:
Some of the best music in a TV show I can recall, though it's a little lean. The tracks are memorable and paint the moods exquisitely and often profoundly. The added dimension introduced in the soundtrack toward
                  the end as the gravitas of the plot becomes ever-greater is one of the key elements which takes this show to rarified heights.
Character:
Adequate balance of character development without disturbing the tempo of the storytelling. We learn just enough about the characters, the depth of development sufficing, without getting bogged down. The important feature here is how the flow of the show isn't compromised by clunky writing, and a large part of that is the handling of character development and the time given to it.
Enjoyment:
Wish I could give it 11/10. The main draw of this show for me is how endlessly enjoyable it is. Perhaps other shows have better peaks and better sakuga and such, but the sheer joy of watching this tale unfold is simply unsurpassed perhaps in TV show history - so that includes shows which are not anime. If there is one show I could watch again and again it's FMA: Brotherhood. It's the way in which the show weaves together all its aspects with a flair and brilliance rarely matched, which gives the show a perpetual impetus — albeit I must confess that episodes ~30-39 didn't pull me through with the exhileration of the rest.
Overall:
It's a 10/10 - a score I give out very infrequently, whether that's for TV, movies, music, so on. Not that I ever want to instruct what people should do, but FMA:Brotherhood is one of the few ""must at least try it out"" shows.",10
"
                FMA:B is certainly a great anime, but personally I didn't find it that outstanding.
Concept: 9/10 the cocepts and ideas behind FM:B are great. lots of original ideas. it's more than anything philosophical. one might not agree with everything. but they are still interesting to explore. also they might not be that catchy at first.
Plot: 8.5/10: the plot is really good for the most part, everything is fairly balanced with great conflicts, great twists. and also some comedy. It's not too complicated, actually it's quite simple at times, I would say it explores complex ideas with simplicity(to some degree) 
however it's not always necessarily engaing.
first few
                  episodes are boring(for well known reasons) but even after that it might not keep you interested all the time.
(for the first few eps) the show fails to properly build up for some stuff early on. and you just don't feel the anticipation and thrill (=less interest). and when you get to some events, they might feel underwhelming because of that.
but as for the rest, I'm not really sure why it was not that interesting for me at times. I think it's because the show does not constantly present you with really catchy stuff for a good portion of the story. it's mostly build up with catchy stuff in between. for me it really got good at about the mid point when the build up was done and everything started unraveling. at which point I was fully invested. but others might not be that patient.
Visuals 8/10: Art and animation is fairly good for it's time. action is also good.
soundtracks 8/10
Characters 10/10: the characters in FMA are genuinely great. great protagonist(s), great antagonist(s). sometimes decent sometimes mind blowing motivations. exploration of each character done nicely. ironic fates. great main characters, fairly decent side characters. almost all important characters have some level of unique complexity and are really interesting and likeable. even the villains.
Enjoyment 8/10: it might or might not be personal taste, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.
Overall 8.7/10: with that being said, I personally don't find it to be the best anime of all time it's certainly great. but just not on that level. for me it's a high 8, not above 9. besides it's concepts and ideas there is not really something about this show that will blow your mind. concept isnn't everything. great animation, action, music, complex plot, complex characters, almost every other aspect is done better by other shows, sometimes altogether sometimes individually.",8
"
                10/10 Masterpiece do I even need to justify it? It's been #1 on this site forever, you all know it's good.
Is it perhaps, over-hyped a bit? Is there anything overrated about this show that maybe gives it a boost in popularity it doesn't deserve? Actually, that's probably true. I think that like Naruto, FMA as a franchise was a gateway anime for a lot of people, myself included. The 2003 series was always on on Adult Swim when I was in middle school and I remember when this series first dropped it was a bid deal.
I didn't watch it at the time it came out
                  because I didn't really understand how it would be different from the 2003 series, and the first episode is kind of a confusing one. They were trying to tell us this would be a brand new story starting from the beginning and following the manga more closely, but it seemed this first episode wouldn't make any sense to anyone who wasn't already familiar with the characters. It was like they were trying to say, yeah it's a new show but come on in look we've got all your favorite guys in it.
Lowart is a youtube channel that has a really long in depth video series talking about all the differences between the two shows, so if you've got like 5 hours to kill check it out. I think that regardless this show is one of those few great anime that manages to tell a complete story in just around 50-75 episodes. I think this is a level of storytelling that is rare in the medium. Most often you'll either get anime that run 12 episodes and never get an ending, go buy the manga please, or you get One Piece. 1000 episodes strong upon writing this and no signs of stopping anytime soon. It's okay to let a story progress quickly and end organically rather than milk it forever just because it keeps making money.
Just the story being complete would be enough to get this an 8 for being good. But the story is also still really good, even after seeing it so many times I choke up a bit near the end. I love the episode where Hohenheim reminisces on his past, especially since we aren't sure at that point in the story what the deal with Father is or whether Hohenheim is actually a bad guy. I love the prince of Xing and Mustang and Greed and Scar, to say nothing of our main protagonists. It's a good story with amazing character writing that manages to be complete and cohesive and not go on forever.
So yeah maybe it's a little overhyped because of it's position as the great gateway anime, but honestly you could do much worse for a gateway series. Imagine becoming an anime fan on stuff like Trigun or Cowboy Bebop. Frickin anime boomers.",10
"
                It's been quite long since I watched my first anime ever, Cowboy Bebop, so I decided to watch another anime recently, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
As someone who has a twin brother, I found Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood's story and main characters to be very relatable at times, and that made the experience all the more engaging and emotional. However, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has incredible story and characters on its own anyway, filled with different metaphors, themes and ideas.
Surprisingly enough, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a fairly humorous series with a wonderful sense of humor and witty dialogue!
Also, the music - particularly the opening/ending themes - is beautiful, and
                  the pacing is consistent. I've heard that the first few episodes feel rushed if you watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist series but I didn't have a problem personally because I haven't watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist series.
Fortunately for Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I actually can't think of any major flaws to be honest; I thought it was pretty much perfect overall.
Pros:
+ Engrossing story & characters
+ Charming humor & dialogue
+ Amazing music
+ Well-paced plot
Cons:
- None
Final Rating: 10/10
- Masterpiece -
Simply put, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a masterpiece; it's fascinating in every single way, it never gets boring and it does almost everything right.
Do I recommend it?:
Hell yes! It's really worth your time.
If you're a fan of Anime, you must watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.",10
"
                In my opinion, no matter how good the Anime is, it will be very difficult to beat this Anime Remake from Fullmetal Alchemist and it is not wrong if there are people who OVERPROUD this anime, the main reason is of course the StoryLine which is very stunning and doesn't leave the slightest gap until to make me stand and applaud after seeing the sentence `` Fin '' on the last scene at LastEps.
If almost all anime only have a StoryLine 0-80 or a maximum of 0-98, this anime even has a StoryLine 0-101, especially with the 10 opening and ending songs which are so
                  nice to hear with lyrics that are so in accordance with the situation that is happening in The anime. In addition, each Chara also gets their own portion in the story plus the concept of science combined with the Fantasy genre that makes us so interested in exploring and understanding what Alchemy really is, (I plan to make a Thread about this Anime in the next post😊) . So of course it's not wrong if this Anime is no longer called Legend but Master Piece hehe. [Remember this is my opinion Loh: v]
   The only drawback of this Anime is that it brings the element of God and then it violates its Nature (Even though I know that the god referred to in this Anime is not the real God but a supreme fictional existence in FMAverse, after all the God that is meant here is not Omnipotence but only Omnisaince. ], Actually there are no shortcomings at all in FMAB Anime but because I am also a religious community so in my opinion those are the few drawbacks:)
    • Personal Rate: 11/10.",10

                it's one of the best animes that i have ever seen the plot is very interesting and u can never guess what's going to happen next not to mention that all the opening songs are smply awsm and there'salso comedy in the anime for all anime lovers this is simply one anime that u can't miss out on
              ",10
"
                A masterpiece of an Anime and one I recommend to watch.
The story, art, characters, and action of this story are all on point, so you can never get bored watching.
The story starts off with two brothers just wanting to return their bodies to normal, yet as the story goes on they discover deeper and larger conspiracies that threaten the entire country if not the world.
The dynamic of Ed and Al shows as they are brothers who would do anything for the other. It sometimes feels like there is one main character, that being the Elric Brothers.  
There are so many interesting and meaningful characters
                  throughout the entire story you can't help but feel for them all.
So again, I recommend this anime be a must-see.",10
"
                I really enjoyed wachting it. It  has one of the best the story lines I have ever seen. Detials in storyline and also in the art made love it. It has really good character development and also pretty good side characters. They did not neglect the side chacters and focus on the main characters. All characters are well writen. Soundtracks are pretty good as well. They are perfectly suited to the scenes. It made me feel the emotions in those scnes. Art in the fmab is good as well. They really tried their best for the art. Overall I recommend everyone to watch it.

                Nice time pass anime, I enjoyed the story but sometimes after half 30episodes, it feels like it is being stretched. Animation and sound is good, the majority of the story focuses on character building. I can say that this anime is for people who like watching story-type anime, brotherhood and somewhat childish anime.
Nice plot twists at the end of a few episodes but it was so long to watch 50+ episodes of the story that I wanted it to just finish asap.
This is not the genre I usually watch and it is 64+ episodes so It was not worth watching for me.
