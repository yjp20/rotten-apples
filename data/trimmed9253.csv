                ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***
""People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non subjective viewpoint it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbley ... timey wimey ... stuff"" - The Doctor
When it comes to entertainment, one of the easiest things to get wrong is the concept of time travel. Part of the reason for this is because our scientific understanding of ""reality"" is still in its infancy, and this means that the writers for shows like Doctor Who, Quantum Leap, even Star Trek, must apply their imagination and creativity in order to resolve some of the
                  inherent paradoxes that will occur whenever a narrative decides to hop, skip or jump.
In other words, they make it up.
More often than not the implausibility of any sort of time travel is camouflaged with pseudo-science, techno-babble, and a good smattering of conversational quantum-hokum. These add a veneer of believability so that the average person can achieve the suspension of disbelief required to buy into the storyline. When it comes to anime though, the concept of travelling through time has generally lacked in substance, delivery, and even narrative relevance.
Until now ...
Originally a visual novel by 5pb and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate tells the story of Okabe Rintaro (the self styled mad scientist known as Hououin Kyouma), and his ""colleagues"" at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Hashida ""Daru"" Itaru and Shiina Mayuri. Okabe spends his days making strange inventions with Daru, and the oddest one so far is the Phone Microwave [name subject to change]. At first it seems as though this device does nothing more than turn bananas into a green, jelly-like substance, but it has a hidden side effect that no one knows about. Everything seems placid and normal until the day that Okabe and Mayuri decide to attend a lecture given by the eminent Professor Nakabachi on the subject of time machines and time travel.
For the most part Steins;Gate is a surprisingly well thought out series that applies the notion of cause and effect in a reasonably intelligent manner. The plot follows a logical, if somewhat timeworn progression, and while there are numerous recycles, repeats, reboots, and ""do overs"" that form an integral part of any time travel tale, these are handled in a way that would have turned Endless Eight from tedium incarnate into an arc that was at least watchable. The show throws around a number of concepts and theories to explain or justify certain  aspects of the science fiction, and on quite a few occasions these have been woven into the main body of the plot very well. Ideas like the Butterfly Effect (which, given the visual cues, should be obvious to anyone), the Observer Effect and Schr√∂dinger's Cat have been used to support the problems caused by time travel (and their resolution), and in that respect Steins;Gate deserves a good deal of praise for trying to use science to support the science fiction (and it does it far better than the likes of Puella Magi Madoka Magica).
Unfortunately it's not all fun and games.
One of the problems within the narrative is the inevitable conflict between human drama and science fiction, and in true anime fashion the emotional side wins out. This has the unfortunate effect of removing much of the chaos that is inherent in a story about time travel, and replacing it with predictability and melodrama. Thankfully the human side of the tale is handled in a surprisingly decent manner, but this is tempered by the fact that a number of basic questions are never actually addressed. The very nature of this anime automatically requires that certain aspects be resolved or explained, and while there are all sorts of ""scientific"" reasons flying around, the series tends to shy away from tackling certain first order issues like the Grandfather Paradox.
There's also the matter of the rather ""neat"" ending, but we'll get to that in a bit.
Steins;Gate is a very good looking series, but as with any adaptation from another visual medium, there's an automatic limitation placed on aspects like character design. That said, White Fox have produced a series that viewers may find appealing, if a little generic at times, and have used what they've been given to very good effect. The character animation is of a high standard, and many of the visual effects are imaginative and well choreographed (which should be no surprise given that White Fox also produced Tears to Tiara and Katanagatari). It's unfortunate then, that the typical anime mentality comes to the fore in the little details, the main one being the distinct lack of variety where clothing is concerned. Everyone seems to have only one outfit, which may seem a little picky to some, but imagine how you would feel if you wore the same underwear for three weeks while running around and in mostly warm weather.
This mentality also comes to the fore in the script, and while the majority of the dialogue in the show is actually pretty good, the usual shenanigans come out to play at times when there really doesn't need to be any more drama. Thankfully the voice actors are experienced enough to know how to deal with the scriptwriters' attempts at overcompensating for various shortcomings, and in truth they're the ones that carry this series. If it wasn't for the talents of Miyano Mamoru, Imai Asami, Seki Tomokazu, Hanazawa Kana, and the rest of the cast, Steins;Gate would quickly collapse under its own weight, and it's thanks to the seiyuu's abilities that the more technical or scientific portions of the script can be delivered in a manner that fits with the narrative.
The opening sequence features Hacking The Gate by Ito Kanako, a fairly average J-pop track track that has been set to a montage of most of the characters who seem to be deep in contemplation while a variety of clock faces, cogs and technical looking diagrams zip around the screen. On the other hand, The Twelve Time Governing Covenants by Sakakibara Yui works rather well as the  closing theme, and for the most part the end sequence is a far more subtle and off kilter affair that is more in tune with the atmosphere of the series proper (until the last few seconds that is, and one has to wonder about the mentality of the person who thought ending the sequence like that was a good idea).
As for the background music, there's a rather nice variety of tracks that are often very subtly used. More often than not the series relies on mundane noises and silence, and because of that attention has been paid to the timing and usage of the score.
Steins;Gate has a core set of characters who are surprisingly well defined from the start of the series, but in terms of overall development much of the growth applies only to Okabe. Now this isn't really surprising given the events in the story, and to be honest the show is actually better with his character being the only one who truly changes. Okabe's development when dealing with the events that are rapidly spiralling out of control is handled in a sensitive yet realistic manner, and it's nice to see that the anime hasn't shied away from depicting the apathy he feels after experiencing a series of personally harrowing events.
Unfortunately the attempts to further develop some of the other characters tend to fall a little short of the mark, and this leads to a few situations that effectively remove the dramatic tension that has been painstakingly built up. The sad part is that while it's laudable to try and develop characters like Suzu, Mayuri, Feyris, and even Tennouji Yugo (Mr Braun), this should never come at the detriment of the main storyline.
Steins;Gate is a very entertaining series that isn't afraid to play around with various scientific concepts, but at the same time it clearly avoids tackling certain major issues related to time travel, and the focus on human drama can sometimes be at odds with the events in the storyline. That said, it's a very enjoyable anime that doesn't get too bogged down in technicalities, and while I rather liked the fact that Okabe cast himself in the role of mad scientist (complete with laugh), imagine my surprise at finding out he's supposed to be 18 years old.
Which brings us back to the ending.
There's a certain ... ""clinical"" ... feel to the conclusion that really doesn't sit too well, and while it's always nice to see a story end happily, one has to wonder about the plausibility of it all. The thing is, Steins;Gate uses a concept of time travel similar to that used in Quantum Leap, and therein lies the problem. Anyone who is familiar with the latter series knows that Dr Sam Beckett (an actual doctor, not an 18 year old first year student like Okabe), is unable to return to his original timeline because too many changes have been made to past events. In the nomenclature of Steins;Gate, he's moved across too many world lines and affected too many lives, and this is one of the major things that Steins;Gate glosses over completely. Now one could argue that the idea used in the series creates an effective escape clause, but that only covers certain people. The simple fact is that everyone you meet when you travel through time, no matter how brief the contact, is affected by your presence, so in order to return to one's original timeline, one must undo every contact with every person, even down to brushing shoulders with a total stranger on the street.
One of the other aspects that really should have been explored is Okabe's ability, Reading Steiner. At no point does the series delve into why he has this ability or how it works, and this is more than a little odd given how much importance is placed on ""Fool yourself. Fool the world"".
Even with those issues though, Steins;Gate is easily one of the better science fiction anime to appear in the last few years, and while there are areas that could have been improved upon, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Steins;Gate is an enjoyable romp in the realms of implausibility that delivers on several levels, and while the happy ending may not sit well with everyone, the conclusion to the story does offer a degree of catharsis.
It's just a shame that everyone seems to think you need a happy ending in order to make a story great.",8

                ‚ÄúNo one knows what the future holds. That‚Äôs why its potential is infinite.‚Äù
Okabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)
Such a powerful quote, from an anime at least just as powerful. It‚Äôs one of the many wise quotes featured in the excellent time travelling tale called Steins;Gate. It is a story praised by many, and I think the show is definitely worthy of all its praise: it‚Äôs an excellent piece of work. Steins;Gate is, in essence, a unique anime. There‚Äôs not a single show that I found to be comparable to Steins;Gate.
But why does everyone think of Steins;Gate as such a masterpiece?
Story: 10/10
Steins;Gate is about Okabe Rintarou, a ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù
                  who spends his time hanging out in his laboratory with his friends Mayuri and Daru. Ocassionally, they manage to invent futuristic gadgets, though these are never worth mentioning. The first few episodes may turn you down, as it seems like your general slice of life/comedy anime. However, when their most interesting invention, the Phone Microwave, turns out to be able to send text messages through time, everything changes: the text messages sent to the past have a huge impact on the present. When Okabe, in a horrifying way, finds out about an evil organization called SERN, and their ways, he is forced to use time travelling methods to prevent from getting captured ‚Äì and stop their plans. This (around episode 9) is where the amazing Sci-Fi thriller fires up its engines, and puts the viewer on the edge of their seat. What follows is a fascinating (somewhat complex) plot, which manages to blow your mind each episode. Steins;Gate is not just your generic time traveling show; the plot is executed perfectly. Hardly ever before have I encountered such a well thought through plot as featured in Steins;Gate. The show features several jumps in time, but still manages to keep the viewers‚Äô attention without confusing them. The pace present in Steins;Gate is not lacking either ‚Äì in fact, from episode 9 onwards the show holds a perfect pace. Piece by piece, the mystery of the events that happen is unveiled, working towards a fantastic, satisfying ending. (Which is very rare, especially for a show with such a complex plot) Story - and plot wise, Steins;Gate is pretty much an unprecedented piece of art, and I think it might stay so for a while.
Art: 8/10
This is the field in which Steins;Gate lacks the most. Steins;Gate isn‚Äôt a show with a huge budget, and therefore it is to be expected that the art isn‚Äôt jaw-dropping. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean that the art is bad, or that the drawing style is unbearable. In fact, the goal of the art is to portray the atmosphere as well as possible ‚Äì and it does: the art style simply has a way more realistic feel to it than your generic anime.
Sound: 8/10
Amazing voice acting, nice opening, and decent BGM. There were quite some moments where I think there could have been made better use of background music, which is why it misses out on a perfect score here. Nonetheless, very solid sound overall.
Characters: 10/10
What can I say, the characterization in this one is just fantastic. The characters are written in such a way that you are bound to like them. They all have their own likeable and recognizable traits, which are perfectly described from the start: Makise Kurisu the tsundere, Daru the nerd, Mayuri the childish girl, and so on. I found myself having a weak spot for Kurisu in no time. There‚Äôs hardly any character development, but I think this is not necessarily a bad thing; it would only distract from the fantastic plot that is ahead of the viewer. The only character which, logically so, develops, is Okabe: you‚Äôll find him changing in character over the course of episodes, due to the events that unfold. But this is all for the better: this development is, again, done exceptionally well. The development has a very realistic feeling to it (And so do all the characters in general), which makes the story as a whole even more compelling. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
Steins;Gate is one of the few shows that manages to score a 10 on enjoyment for me. Like most people, I found Steins;Gate hard to get into, as the first few episodes don‚Äôt really cover much ground. However, once the engine got running, I was hooked. I couldn‚Äôt refrain myself from watching episode after episode, slowly crawling to the awesome ending ahead. And I think most people would; as the plot is set up in such a way to keep you hooked each episode. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, then you will surely enjoy this anime ‚Äì but that‚Äôs not a necessity. Steins;Gate is an anime that is very likely to keep you hooked. So go ahead, you won't waste your precious time. In fact, you might want to go back in time to watch it again!",10
"
                The subject of time travel is no stranger to the world of anime, so it takes a lot of work to make a time travel story stand out. For Steins;Gate, that hard work paid off. This is by far the best-executed time travel story that I've ever seen in my experience with anime, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're definitely missing out!
Story: 10
The story revolves around the antics of Rintarou Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist that goes by the alias ""Hououin Kyouma,"" as he essentially dicks around with time and subsequently deals with the consequences of his selfish actions. I'll be completely honest
                  and say that the incredibly slow and random start to the anime threw me off so much that I re-watched the first episode 4 times over the course of 6 months before I could resolve to just pushing onward and finishing the anime. However, this slow start is balanced out by the fast-paced second half. By the end, it was answering questions that I never thought to ask, pointing out the significance of things that had long been discarded by my mind, and that sense of tying up loose ends is just the most refreshing feeling to have after dealing with so many time travel stories that are too lazy to clean up after themselves.
Unlike many time travel stories, especially in the world of anime, Steins;Gate has no noticeable inconsistencies objectively. I say objectively because this is a science fiction story, and that makes it really hard for everyone to agree on it. The thing is, none of us have experienced time travel in the way the characters in these science fiction stories have (and if you have experienced it, I'm very sorry for making assumptions), so there isn't a clear right or wrong way to write a time travel story. Obviously, if a story contradicts itself, something went wrong. But Steins;Gate seems to obey its own rules, and while a lot of people have made very compelling arguments that point out flaws in Steins;Gate's concept of time travel, they all make assumptions about how time travel works, and no one can really say for sure how things would change if we altered the past. 
In the end, this isn't a science textbook, it's a science fiction anime. It's not supposed to be 100% believable, otherwise we wouldn't be able to watch it and say ""wow, that was unbelievable!"" I give the story a 10/10 because it was interesting, well-researched (many ideas are borrowed from other works of science fiction and played with), and overall just plain entertaining. 
Art: 8
I really prefer talking about the art of a particularly spectacular-looking anime or else a particularly underwhelming-looking anime. Since the art in Steins;Gate is neither extremely good or extremely bad, I'll rate it an 8/10 for not influencing my opinion of the anime in either direction. Consider it a passing grade, basically where we should expect the art quality of anime to be in this day and age. Anything better would be remarkable.
Sound: 9
I can't say much for the soundtrack, but the voice acting is awesome! Okabe's seiyuu is all kinds of talented, but everything good about the sound in this anime, and really, everything good about life in general, can be summed up in the maniacal laugh of Hououin Kyouma. I can't really speak for the English dub, and while I love Michael J. Tatum's work in Baccano, what I've heard of the dub sounds to be sorely lacking compared to the Japanese voices. Miyano Mamoru is just so cool! Sonuvabitch!
One thing of note about the soundtrack is the lack of one for a large portion of the anime. During quiet moments, rather than listening to quiet music, you're usually just listening to nothing. This is something that I've seen a few times, and I think it's pretty cool. It accentuates the importance of those scenes that do have music, and at the very least creates a nice contrast of mood, not between happy and sad music, but between silence and... not silence.
Character: 10
You should know that while not each and every character is the pinnacle of how great anime characters can be, they're all very interesting, entertaining, and Hououin Kyouma can handle being the pinnacle of just about everything.
But really, my rule for judging a character to be good  is that I either like them or appreciate how much I don't like them. There are characters that I like and characters that I don't like in Steins;Gate, but all of them fit, and none of them are pointless and annoying. And yeah, Okabe is startlingly charismatic, and that can take an anime pretty far in the character department.
Enjoyment: 10
This anime made me laugh maniacally and cry silently. It also made me think, and it rewarded my thoughts by having closure and clarity, which left me more than satisfied. Easily a 10/10 anime, and now one of my favorites that I've seen!",10

                As you may have noticed, Steins;Gate is revered as a masterpiece by most.  For those of you who haven't had the privilege of watching this show yet, i'm writing this (belated) review to emphasize just how much you're missing out on. 
First of all, you have to understand that Steins;Gate is completely unique compared to other anime, in terms of story line. Now, with such a complex plot, it would be incredibly easy to mess the series up. Except that they didn't. If they did, it wouldn't a masterpiece. Steins;Gate explores the world of time travelling and time lines, putting in acknowledgements to theories
                  such as the butterfly effect and how, once you change a minor thing of the past, the future transitions into one large scrambled egg. Once you pass the first slow starting episodes, the intrigue and mystery begins, and the pace of the series accelerates. The plot throws in numerous surprises and sudden, unexpected turns that, in turn, creates a powerful ending that is almost flawless. Also, you're hit bluntly in the face with quite a lot of feels early on in the series. 
One of the great things about Steins;Gate is that the characters are developed incredibly well. Astonishingly well. To the point that you feel connected with them in terms of their feelings and aims. They each have their quirky side too - not everything is all serious. I'm talking about the mad scientist personality, the Dr.Pepper jokes and Daru's perverted jokes which lightens up the series so that it isn't all serious drama. But the trouble is, the more like able the characters are, the harder you find it to leave them behind when the series ends, meaning that even a week after Steins;Gate ends, you'll probably still be thinking about Okabe whenever you spot a bottle of Dr.Pepper. 
I didn't really pay attention much to the soundtrack of the series, i admit, due to the fact that i didn't find it all that enthralling or unique. However, i did enjoy the opening and the ending particularly. Aside from that, the soundtrack did it's job of emphasizing the mood/atmosphere of scenes pretty well. 
The animation in itself was done really well though - i found that the consistency was great, meaning that (to my eye) there was no sudden drops in quality. 
Something that i loved the most was that the ending was fantastic. There were barely any loose threads, and as a poor ending can sometimes ruin a good series, i'm grateful that they executed such a content finale. 
I stress that you must watch this series. It's not enough for you to read however many reviews you can lay your eyes on, but to actually experience this masterpiece for yourself.

                Just a horrible anime. This is the anime equivalent of Inception. It tries to disguise itself as being complex and cool when it's really simple and stupid.  How it managed to fool so many people into believing it is the former is beyond me.
The story is just a complete mess. Even the very premise of the anime would not have ever happened had the so called time travel expert followed the very basic concepts you learn from any time travel story. Not to tell everyone about your time machine let alone let people screw around with it. The show basically makes you watch as
                  the main character repeatedly make this same out of character mistake you've seen 100 times before over and over again until he finds out that doing so screwed up everything up. GASP! What a shocker! He then spends the rest of the series struggling to try and undo everything. 
All the characters are walking over the top anime stereotypes. They can all but summed up in their entirety in about a half dozen words if even. The silent girl that always texts. The he that looks like a she. The moe girl. The computer nerd otaku. The tsundere. That's not oversimplification, there's really not much else to get into about these characters. They are really that shallow. 
I'd give it a pass if it was some harem joke anime, but for a story driven anime, this is just unacceptable. The only one that seems to get significant character development is the main character. A mad scientist, which the writer seems to think is a valid excuse to have him do the most out of character ridiculous nonsense all the time. This makes him completely unrelatable which leads you to remotely stop caring about any of what he goes through.
While you're struggling to try to piece together all the plot holes, to understand why the time travel expert keeps blabbing about his time machine to every person he meets on the street and to make sense of dumb concepts like how a banana that is somehow reduced to jello but still retains it's shape so you can identify it after traveling through time, don't be fooled. It's not because it's a really deep well thought out story that you're having trouble understanding everything. It's because it's 
TUTURU~
Shallow and poorly written. 3/10",3

                One word: Hype.
Before watching this show, i was amazed by it's high scores, big fanbase and critics puting it to a pedestal. I had high expectations and was going into it thinking it would be the second time Jesus would step on earth. But as always, there's nothing worse, than diving into the hype.  
What else should i say? Steins;Gate has everything a mass consumer needs:a concept about time travel, sci-fi theme coupled with unique characters and....a poorly written story. How did something like this went wrong? I can't imagine, since the production values were high enough to hire a good writer. Not only
                  the first half of the show, specifically the first 12 episodes do absolutely nothing, and i mean NOTHING. They are painfully boring, painfully slow, painfully killing every good aspect the show initially put into it. After that it gets better, but i didn't have the desire to watch it, because if half of the show is shitty, there's just no helping it. But i still forced myself through the agony. And.... it still didn't pay off in the end.
Now about the characters, they all seem out of this world. I mean an 18 year old guy invents a time machine? Or an 18 year old girl writtes scientific articles, is a research member and somehow she surpasses her own father? and a few other characters also seem unrealistic. The only real character is maybe the owner of the office where the cast was spending most of their time.
Only the art is good, but even then, the setting is very strange, the sun is somehow to yellowish, i don't know, some colors where too bright.
Overall, i didn't enjoy Steins;Gate as i would have expected. It represents very well the hype that never justifies itself and that Steins;Gate is a second class, no, a third-class show. It is slow, dull and weak.",6
"
                Note that I have not read the visual novel that Steins;Gate is based on. This is a review which judges the anime adaptation by its own merits alone.
Over the last year since the Steins;Gate anime finished airing, the series has garnered massive popularity and acclaim, becoming an internet sensation and skyrocketing to #3 on MAL‚Äôs Top Anime page. So, the obvious question is: does it live up to the insane hype? Well, yes and no.
Steins;Gate is a mixed bag of sorts. It has some great concepts behind it, but they often fall short in their execution. The story follows Okabe ‚ÄúHououin Kyouma‚Äù Rintarou, his lab
                  assistants Hashida ‚ÄúDaru‚Äù Itaru and Shiina ‚ÄúMayushii‚Äù Mayuri and their encounters with time travel. The story should be familiar to any science-fiction fan, and for the most part stays within the established expectations and norms of the genre, including all the technobabble and repeated recursions of time that one would come to expect. The plot is packed with drama and thrills, and this can make for a very exciting experience for those who just want to sit back and enjoy the ride without sweating the details. However, if you‚Äôre a supporter of science or even basic cause and effect, you may find yourself wanting to rip your hair out in frustration at the massive leaps in logic this show makes on a regular basis.
The series sells itself as a sort of celebration of science; the characters, self-proclaimed mad scientists, are constantly parading around in lab coats, talking about science, using science lingo and bragging about their immeasurable intellect. The problem is that Steins;Gate isn‚Äôt nearly as intelligent or ‚Äúsciencey‚Äù as it would like to think it is. The scientific justifications behind the various implausible events which take place throughout the duration of the show range from the laughable to the absurd. They are grounded in some solid scientific principles such as chaos theory and special and general relativity, but whoever dreamt up these explanations is obviously someone whose grasp on these principles is shaky at best. 
Now, I‚Äôm aware that it‚Äôs unreasonable to expect absolute scientific accuracy out of a time travel tale, but the series also violates some more basic principles that you don‚Äôt have to be a science geek to understand so much as you just have to think about what you‚Äôre watching as you‚Äôre watching it. Things such as the butterfly effect and world lines are treated with almost childish simplicity, and one plot thread in particular throws the entire concept of cause and effect out the window in exchange of ‚Äúfate,‚Äù a device which seems extremely out of place in a sci-fi series. There are some unresolved plot threads, and some things that deserve a scientific explanation go by without so much as an attempt at one, which only serves to further damage the show‚Äôs image as a ‚Äúscience‚Äù anime that it spends so much time trying to build up. It‚Äôs things like this that make me wish that, if they weren‚Äôt capable of creating a convincing and consistent sci-fi story, the creators would have just gone the magic route instead of wasting so much time with far-fetched pseudoscience explanations.
On the more emotional side of things than the cold, hard science is the character-driven drama, and in the case of Steins;Gate, it‚Äôs this side that outshines the other. The characters themselves, however, leave something to be desired. Although the anime panders to otakus in other ways (the dialogue is peppered with 2ch memes, and the show is not without its fanservice scenes), the area where this is most prevalent is the characters. Daru is the perverted otaku surrogate, with the rest of the main cast neatly filling the role of a different otaku-friendly stereotype. Kurisu plays the blushing, stammering, tsundere-for-everything girl (who wants nothing more than to assure you that it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs tsundere or anything), Mayuri the air-headed moe girl with an irritating catchphrase, Ruka the trap whose actual gender is irrelevant given the exception of one particularly ridiculous arc, Moeka the silent, predominantly emotionless girl who communicates solely by texting, and ‚ÄúFaris Nyan Nyan‚Äù the flirty catgirl maid who, as you may have guessed from her name, feels obligated to add cat noises into her speech at every opportunity. It wouldn't be such a problem if only one or two of these archetypes were used, but the fact that main cast is made almost entirely up of them seems just a little too convenient. Okabe, as the protagonist, manages to avoid these stereotypes altogether, and as a result he is by far the most interesting and enjoyable to watch out of the main cast.
The other characters, though stereotypical they may be, are given more depth than the average anime that contains these stereotypes. These characters are each given their own dedicated arc through which their personalities are fleshed out, and these arcs, though somewhat predictable due to the way the second half of the show is structured, are where Steins;Gate excels most. It‚Äôs unfortunate, though, that any character development that happens within these arcs is completely undone by the next resetting of time, which makes one romance subplot feel particularly forced and unnatural, something that is half-compensated for with a plot device that should have a scientific justification behind it but slips by without one anyway. The series also feels somewhat empty, as there are very few background characters in the series to accompany the relatively small main cast, and there are even a few instances where the viewer is lead on to think there are more characters than there actually are, only for it to be revealed that the true identities of these characters are actually the same as those of other characters.
The series makes some attempts at humour to lighten the mood, primarily through the interactions of the characters, which largely consists of arguing, in frequent and large doses. Now, you might expect that people who are brilliant enough scientists to break the very laws upon which modern science is based would be capable of coming up with some rather witty quips, but the banter between the characters is mostly made up of immature name-calling followed by the recipient of the name-calling expressing their distaste for the name which they have just been called. This may be amusing to some, but it got very old very fast for me and I grew tired of it by the second episode. These bouts, however, become less and less frequent as the show progresses and becomes more serious which is definitely a plus.
I‚Äôm confused as to whether I should be rating the art or the animation in this review, since the page for writing a review says art while the finished review that other people see says animation. It‚Äôs a shame that I can‚Äôt rate them separately, but I‚Äôll talk about them both here anyway. Personally, I was not the biggest fan of the character designs as they appeared rather lifeless to me much of the time (I think it was the pale skin tone and white pupils). Many of the characters also suffered from some of the worst cases of noodle limbs since Code Geass, with the obvious exception of Daru, who looked to me like the strange offspring of a barrel and a human. On the other hand, the anime was made with very high production values, and it shows; the proportions of the drawings remain consistent and the animation is smooth, with few hiccups throughout. The backgrounds also look rather nice and detailed, and offer a nice backdrop to the characters and their various antics without distracting attention away from them.
The music in Steins;Gate is rather good, with some quite memorable background pieces that are placed with appropriate timing to accentuate the different emotions that the various scenes in the show aim to convey. The opening and closing sequences are solid tracks with some rather pretty and high-budget visuals that do a fine job of representing the series, including some hints about the show‚Äôs plot dropped here and there. The voice talent in the anime is strong, with Miyano Mamoru‚Äôs performance as Okabe in particular standing out. The other performances are somewhat overshadowed by this, but are solid performances nonetheless. I did have some personal hang-ups about the casting though; Daru‚Äôs voice (which I was surprised to find out was put on by Seki Tomokazu) was especially hard for me to take seriously during dramatic scenes due to its cartoonish quality.
Enjoyment is probably the area where people‚Äôs experiences differ most, as it is the most subjective. Personally, I found my immersion being broken frequently by questionable science and plot holes, which hindered my enjoyment significantly. The humour wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea either, but I can see why people find the show as enjoyable as they do. This is doubly true if you‚Äôre a non-critical person or are just new to anime in general, a group of people which seems to make up a large chunk of the Steins;Gate fandom as, over the last year, it has become a gateway anime through which many newcomers have been introduced to the medium.
You might now be under the impression that I hate this anime after reading this review, as it focused more on the negatives than others; however, this is not the case. Although I don‚Äôt normally write reviews, I had some issues with this series that I felt were not addressed properly in the reviews that I read (skimming over most of the 10/10 reviews that nearly fill every page) and decided to take it upon myself to put them out there as someone who watched the show after the hype died down quite a bit. If you still have an unquenched desire to read somebody praising this anime unflinchingly, then feel free to check out almost any other review for this series.",7
"
                Steins;Gate changed my life.
It completely changed my views about anime, and even life in general.
'How can an anime change your life?' You must be thinking. 'Is he completely mad?' You must be asking.
If you think the above, this is probably because you simply didn't watch Steins;Gate.
This review will cover my reasons why you should watch Steins;Gate for those who still did not. It will also hype Steins;Gate through the roof for those who already watched it and want another view about the show.
Alrighty, then. Let's get started.
Story: 10
The story starts out slow, boring and uninteresting, as expected from a story that starts on a small scale. What else can you expect from a story that starts with a small group of friends of a hot summer in Akihabara, in  a small cramped place they gather called 'The Future Gadget Laboratory', with nothing flashy, no boobs, no high budget shounen battle scenes? 
The first episode will confuse you, even bore you because of that.
 You might even want to say... 'Hey, I'll just drop i-' 
STOP.
Don't. Don't be fooled.
 It might start out on a small scale of a simple happy going slice of life anime. But the fact it's no shounen or doesn't have any boobs is plus, and will serve as the form for the great things to come.
You might even think, 'Episode 2. Boring. Episode 3, Boring. Episode 4 Boring. Episode 5, BORING. Episode 6 Boooring. Now lets just drop i-'
But after episode 6 is when the things are going to start super entertaining, intriguing and even funny at times with some nice portions of light hearted-ness. The comedy will be funny, the characters will finally start fleshing out, and the story will progress in a steady pace with no filler moments, nothing to distract from fully  enjoying a truly good story.
ARE YOU STILL NOT ENTERTAINED, going to episode 7 - before the ending of 12?
If you think like that, then this anime is about to change your life, just like it did for the millions who watched it already.
Keep watching, and be amazed. Keep watching, and thank me for creating this review. Keep watching, and add it to your favorites after that. Keep watching... and be prepared for one of the most epic journey ever done in TV shows, movies, manga, games, in the past, present and even in the future. Nothing might even not come close to the experience that Steins;Gate will offer you. I consider Steins;Gate story to be White Fox, Nitro+ and 5pbs true masterpiece. A true life changing Sci-Fi Thriller about Time traveling and everything that beautifully ties into that concept. I don't want to spoil you the story any further.
Art & Animation: 8
The weakest point of Steins;Gate, is truly the art & animation, as it isn't a really high budget anime with amazing animation, beautifully drawn boobs or 200 episode long fighting scenes like in your Typical shounen anime. But it takes out the small budget it has, it uses up every single ¬• out of it. The art in the visual novel in which the anime is based on is done by Huke, and is truly the most surrealistic, most atmospheric and most artistic art I have ever had a chance to lay my eyes upon. The fine fellows in White Fox anime studio said: 'HEY, that art is fucking awesome! But we don't have enough yens to fully transcribe it into a TV series with everything moving like it's alive. So lets take a solid take on the art, which will be much less flashy, but will do the trick'. And so they did.
The final product however, is a bit full of QUALITY in times, and doesn't look really beautiful like in the visual novel.
It looks like a standard realistic art in anime, and while there are some weird hair colors like in your most anime series, this art still helps fleshing out a believable story.
Sound: 9
In the beginning of the anime, you will mostly hear the sounds of cicadas chirping, with barely any BGMs present, and that's why my score was downgraded from a full 10 to a 9. While it feels atmospheric, it can also bore alot of new watchers who are searching for masterpiece first episodes with bombastic Star-Wars like symphonic soundtrack. Later on, there is much more soundtrack, Done by Abo Takeshi who did the soundtrack for the visual novel too, and by Murakami Jun. The soundtrack is different from the visual novel, while there are some tracks present from there fitting to some scenes. My favorite track is 'Gate of Steiner', which is basically the opening title menu music from the visual novel, but is present at the best shocking and thrilling scenes.
Itou Kanako, that I consider as the Goddess of J-pop music after her songs in various Steins;Gate visual novels and ports, has made the opening music, 'Hacking to the Gate'.  I think I listened to this track and to the animated OP more than I watched the whole series and read the visual novel, and considering that I rewatched the series many times and the visual novel is about 50 hours+- long, means that I listened to this track alot. A fuck whole lot, even. It's that good.
Sakakibara Yui has made the ending song for the anime. The song is a pretty sad track, and is a perfect closure to every single ending of every single episode. So perfectly, it fits like a glove into a human hand. A great choice.
Lastly, the SFX are believable in every single scene, and help you feel the tension in the thrilling scenes, laugh your guts out in the funny scenes, cry like a motherfucking wounded animal in the sad scenes. White Fox have them pretty fucking awesome SFX.
Characters: 11/10 (MAL fault for having a faulty grading score, not me):
Okabe Rintarou (Nicknames: [Self Proclaimed] Mad Scientist, [Self Proclaimed] Hououin Kyouma, Okarin) - 
My favorite protagonist of all times. This dude is like fucking anime Jesus or something (Nope, not Jesus from Saint‚òÜOnii-san). For those who didn't watch Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, you might confuse this dude as Schizophrenic, and not as a guy with a simple case of Chuunibyou syndrome.
He helps carry out the shocking scenes with 100 percent enhancement, and his Chuunibyou personality is so addicting and cool, that  I can't help to take out my closed cellphone and say ""OREEEEEEEEEEEE DAAAAAAAAAAAAAA' and ""KIKAN' etc etc.
When shit will get realer than real , his mask of the Chuunibyou will break, and his true layers of his caring personality for his friends will show. He will be sad, shocked, everything you'll expect from a protagonist stuck in a Sci-Fi thriller.11/10 Protagonist, right here. I want to be him.  Where can I buy some Dr Pepper in my country, BTW? 
Makise Kurisu (Nicknames: Christina, Assistant, American Virgin, Perverted Genius Girl , Celeb 17, The Zombie [MAN THATS LIKE 1K NICKNAMES OR SOMETHING]) - 
The main heroine of the series. The best heroine with a tsundere personality, no contest. At the beginning she will act all tsun-tsun, later on when shit gets real, dere-dere. She will help Okabe in the toughest times, and the two will be the perfect combo in them shiny white Lab Coats. 11/10 Heroine.
Shiina Mayuri (Nicknames: Mayushii) -
The mascot of the show who keeps saying Tuturu - and you will too, and a main plot device. No further spoiler allowed, so sorry.
Hashida Itaru  (Nicknames: Daru, Perverted Gentleman, Super Hakar; Robotics;Notes - DaSH, DaSP) -
A fat super hakar- I mean hacker, that without him the main plot won't even budge and will still stay on a small slice of life scale.
Amane Suzuha (Nicknames: Part-Time Warrior, Suzu) - 
;_; (This is probably my third review I'm doing the same description for her, but you can't stop me.)
Akiha Rumiho (Nicknames: Faris Nyan Nyan) -
Moe character that keeps saying Nyan and has cat ears. How perfect can she even get?
Kiryuu Moeka (Nicknames: Shining Finger)  -
I liked her introvert personality at first, then hated her to death, and then liked her when the story came to a closure. You will do the same.
Urushibara Ruka (Nicknames: Rukako) -
I want to tap that trap (Or is he really a trap even later...?) And I'm perfectly straight. Blame anime for that.
Tennouji Nae (Nicknames: Sister Braun [In the visual novel]) - 
Even such a small girl minor character like her as her secrets and awesome scenes, some both different in anime and visual novel. Appears in Robotics;Notes as a full grown sexy lady.
Tennouji Yuugo (Nicknames: Mr. Braun and another [spoiler to tell]) - 
Where can I buy a braun tube? This old guy's speech later in the story is so fucking awesome. Share his secrets too that unfold later on in the story.
Dr. Nakabachi -  Oh man. I'll skip talking about this guy, you'll just see.
Enjoyment : 10
Never before have I enjoyed a series like Steins;Gate. It will change your views on anime and life in general, just like myself.
Overall: 10
It's time to for me to go so I can't write any further. Just.. watch it. That's all.",10

                Tutturu~! It took me awhile to finish this review, school, other online drama and whatnot. So here is my in depth evaluation/praise of the show Steins;Gate. I must say that I have excluded a lot of spoiling content so that I can have a legitimate review posted. This is my first review and I hope it informs you and gives you a different perspective of the show!
The genre of Steins;Gate, from what I observed, was Sci-Fi, Thriller, and Drama. The demography reaches out to both Shonen and Seinen crowds. The concepts of time traveling, time paradox, time looping, time leaping, and the butterfly effect were
                  all presented very well. They were explained with a fluent, consistent logic and the concepts are supported by using time lines (in the show they call it world lines, when really it‚Äôs almost saying ‚Äúparallel universe‚Äù.) Some may criticize Okabe‚Äôs ability to retain his memories through his ‚ÄúReading Steiner‚Äù, which I personally choose to ignore for reasons I will say at the end of the review.
The setting is in modern day society and the conflict is between our main characters and a secret organization called SERN. The whole SERN conflict shows this kind of Terminator-feel to the overall plot and Okabe is basically John Connor in retrospect to the beloved Terminator series. Overall, the story is greatly supported by the several types of conflicts and plot progression being utilized all throughout the series. Steins;Gate also consists of addicting suspense that supplements the story with a fluent, chain-linked consistency that makes you crawl back for more‚Äîa well done job.
Characters are usually all too static in anime, rather than dynamic such as those you find in some Hollywood produced dramas. Here in this particular series, there is a gold mine of dynamic-range for personality and human-quality. A lot of the characters share this quality and all have some elements that any one person could relate to somehow. 
Let‚Äôs start with Okabe Rintarou. He is just this loveable, hilarious mad scientist that starts off as a comic relief by acting as a mad conspiracy theorist. There are several attempts in different series that attempt the main character to act as a comic relief; Okabe accomplishes this attempt with ease such as characters from Gintama would capture attention.  Albeit, the Engrish and Kurisu jokes could get old for some(I personally never get tired of his Engrish due to the excellent voice acting by Miyamo, Mamoru,) he has his frequent moments where you can‚Äôt help but to burst into hysterics.  Besides the comic relief, he also has the strongest human quality. He shows a unique dynamic in such a way that nobody would expect: at first he is a seemingly arrogant college student that is a flamboyant conspiracy theorist, then later on he develops many different states of mind and expresses a diverse range of emotion/mood, finally he resets back to his normal self and shows empowerment. Okabe is by far one of the strongest characters I have ever analyzed in an anime title.
Ah, a fan favorite: Makise Kurisu. She is as tsundere as they come‚Äîin a good way though! The presentation of her tsun side definitely shows the dere in moderation; they definitely kept this clich√© at an appropriate level‚Äîmaking her, in my opinion, one of the better tsunderes in the anime world. As a main character, she too has a dynamic personality that develops as well. Even the tsundere part of her personality supplements her character development, like all ‚Äúdere‚Äù types should accomplish. Her dynamic spectrum is unique to the tsundere type: she appears at first to be a stubborn know-it-all, and then they utilize the tsun-tsun personality to such consistency that later on it makes sense that she‚Äôd eventually show some weakness. She too later becomes an empowered character and my respect for this is inexpressible. 
Tuturu~! Mayushi is certainly the clearest example and definition of ‚Äúcute‚Äù. Hit-or-miss, give-or-take, you can‚Äôt really get pissed off at her character mainly due to the fact that she can be anybody‚Äôs friend at any cost. Being the role of the ‚Äúchildhood friend‚Äù of Okabe, she shows an excellent example of exactly what friendship is. She is always so happy and optimistic, and then becomes somewhat of a push over because of her pure maiden self‚Äîalways too kind to really voice herself unless it was urgent (this exact point here is what drives the plot for half of the series with Okabe.) Lastly, she shows her dedication to keep true to her friendship to motivate a depressed Okabe and return him to his original character with her traits alone. Head-to-toe, inside-and-out, she brings joy to all viewers at some point. 
SUPA-HACKA DARU!!! Itaru fills in the role of the typical otaku, with the twist of being a super hacker. He is a fan of another main character Feiris NyanNyan and shows his otaku qualities through his worship of her. The majority of his character is utilized as comic relief. He is, however funny and loveable. Outside of his perverted sense of humor at times, he does express emotional value at times such as: shock, sadness, and even shows constant determination as technician and hacker. 
Here we have Suzuha Amane, a fun and high-spirited girl that would never seem to have anything mysterious about her until after the plot develops. Simple words I can say to describe her is that she is a curious character. She is a tomboy in all aspects, she rocks the look and has the swag and cuteness factor to pull it off. She too has her human qualities: she is viewed with this enthusiastic persona, then is an ever so weary and shows threatening body language, then shows the same determination that Daru has, then becomes stressed, and then back to her normal self. Here we start to see a trend of the characters all returning to their normal states‚Ä¶
Feiris NyanNyan~ She is simply the other moe factor alongside Mayushi and plays the role of the ever-so cute neko girl. A fun, energetic, cute, lovable, and playful girl puts the sugar to the spice in this show. Her trend for personality is less dynamic than the rest of the characters: starts off as a cute, playful neko girl, then begins to break down emotionally and falls in love, then returns to normal later on.
‚ÄúUrushibara Ruka. The mannerisms and voice of a woman... No... More feminine than any woman. But he's a guy. Taller than Mayuri, but so very thin... But he's a guy. Looks great in a miko outfit... But he's a guy. It's already twilight And yet, it's so hot. The cicadas are crying. But... He's a guy.‚Äù ‚ÄìOkabe.  Okabe pretty much hit the bullseye on Ruka‚Äôs entire character‚Äîthe dangerous bishonen. The moe factor is deceitful, yet so powerfully cute. He is kind, shy and awfully self-conscious overall. There are slight dynamics for Ruka such as playing shy, later sucking up and becoming a bit brave for once, experiences heart break, then follows the trend of returning to normal. A bit flatter than the rest of the characters, but still is a very entertaining character.
Moeka is the last person I wanted to cover, note my sarcasm. She is the fan base‚Äôs least favorite due to her involvement in the plot. She plays the role of the popular pretty girl, although it seems as though she acts like a mute‚Ä¶ odd combination there for sure. She is easily and reasonably a hate-able character because of her total structure and involvement, just everything about her can give her hate‚Äîyet this is why she receives so much attention from the fans. She is interesting; however, that she has this psychological issue from the obvious attachment to her cellular device.  Even she can receive love from some fans due to her ‚Äúemo‚Äù part of her. Her human qualities are a bit odd and she could come straight out of an Edgar Allen Poe tale: she comes off as a dandere at first, then turns absolutely insane, then goes back to her dandere self. It‚Äôs a bit bland compared to even Ruka, but she receives the right amount of attention anyways from her demograph.
The character designs are well done, original and very contemporary. The movement and flow of the characters are flawless as well as the background and scenery. The concept illustrations of world lines and such are presented with amazing touch without the use of any computer graphics. Over all ten out of ten for art.
The voice acting is excellent, emotionally moving, adorable, and unpredictable with the dialogue alone. The emotional drive that comes from the voice actors at certain parts are so well done, that their contribution to the entertainment is one of the key factors of a superb feeling a viewer may get while watching the show.
I noticed that most of the time, the music is either very low or non-existent. I find this to be appropriate for this show and not some cheesy xylophone sounding music during casual moments. During the softer, more melodramatic times they sound a piano piece that utterly captures, raptures your attention and emotion and manipulates the atmosphere and feel of the moment. The score is excellent and consistent.
The opening song ‚ÄúHacking to the Gate‚Äù by Kanako Itou is an anime masterpiece in of itself. Here‚Äôs why I say this: the beats are set at an acceptable tone/volume, the guitars are kept at a constant rhythm that gives a good name to J-Rock for those who are especially unfamiliar to the genre, the vocals are pretty good (the vibrato isn‚Äôt heavily used in her voice, her tone and pitch are stunning, and she has a very powerful voice‚ÄîI think I just became a fan of hers.) The ending song ‚ÄúToki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku by Yui Sakakibara‚Äù is another appropriate song for this series that starts off with a soft instrumental that should really get you on the tip of your chair, awaiting for something epic.  It is a mellow song and interesting at the same time.
Funny how the genre of Steins;Gate is ‚Äúthriller‚Äù; I was thrilled in the sense of utter excitement. My eyes were literally glued to the screen as I, while doing my usual Otakuthon, watched each episode with the suspense one would have when receiving X-Mas presents. There were many moments where I would burst out into laughter, rewinding those parts obnoxiously. There were times where I simply balled out crying, tearing up so much that I had to pause the show in order to finish crying up a river. There were also times that had me blush for how utterly cute and adorable some of the scenes were‚Äîbe it romantic or moe. Even as a guy, I found a lot of the material awesome.
There is my full criticism and review of Steins;Gate. I gave it a ten-out-of-ten status mostly because of the emotional roller coaster I had with it. It isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúhow believable‚Äù an anime may be no matter how close to reality it is trying to resemble. We all watch and seek entertainment simply to be entertained. Albeit there are many, upon many things that needs criticism. I just didn‚Äôt feel that this particular show deserved hardly any criticism, so my overflowing hormones force me to over look some of these in-depth details. Can‚Äôt wait for the specials and many more things to come along from this series! El. Psy. Congroo.",10
"
                I Have no Idea why I am writing this review
I guess I just need to state why Steins;Gate isn`t the greatness thing of all time
OK
Lets start with some good points
Time Travel is one of the hardest things for Sifi shows to handle correct. Why because there is to many things that can go wrong and once something is changed you need to keep that paradox or the change could never have happened.
This show handles that correctly. 
The plot is pretty good not completely original but done well.
The art and sound are fine.
I guess its time for the negatives
It has a slow start. I know you can't judge just on how things start but I should not have to watch 4 hours of something before I get into something. It just doesn't connect with the viewer, to make them feel like they should keep watching. The reason why I kept watching is that I was curious, to know why people love it so much. That is not a good reason, its my reason but not a good one.
That leads to my second point the show drags, and trust me it drags out everything or nearly everything. It does not like to get the point it wants to keep you thinking. Some people might call this creative writing, doing this sometimes is creative, doing this all the time is Dragon Ball Z Fight scenes.
There is a episode if I remember right where it is just the same thing over and over and over.
Characters this one is a little bit more personal obviously.
The Protestant is uninteresting, he is boring, he is ridiculous, and I don't understand him. In saying that the other characters are more interesting but still a little bland. A pervert, A kindhearted unintelligent girl, a genius, a mystery none talker, a what should be a girl, and an energetic girl. 
Even though the characters themselves are not all to interesting the relationships with each other can be. There back stories are OK somewhat generic, so not all that great.",6
"
                Steins;Gate. One of the most popular visual novels of 2009. When I first heard it would get an anime adaptation, I was both psyched and worried. We all know VN to anime adaptations don‚Äôt work out that well most (read: almost ALL) of the time, and we all know that Ch√§oS;HEAd‚Äôs anime was absolutely terrible, especially if you compare it to the obviously superior source material, but even because of all this I was incredibly hyped for it. I had only heard great things about the VN, and I was getting my hopes up really high. 
I didn‚Äôt want to get them too that high
                  though, because I was bound to get disappointed, right? Right?!
Well, guess what. I didn‚Äôt.
Steins;Gate is an absolute masterpiece. The first episode is incredibly confusing, and the rest is some light-hearted story about a group of friends developing a microwave that is able to send text messages to the past. The story does get more dark and thrilling along the way, and when you're half way into the show, shit gets real. As in seriously, it gets effing real. 
Steins;Gate then turns into a science-fiction thriller with twists and turns that almost every viewer did not see coming. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and almost every episode ends with a certain cliffhanger, which made watching this show while it aired extremely painful, but also an amazing experience. The story is very good, and the plot development has great pacing; it is neither rushed, nor slow. 
The show‚Äôs characters are great. They‚Äôre all loveable, and almost all the supporting characters get 1 or 2 episodes dedicated to them, which develop them more than most of the supporting characters of other shows. And what‚Äôs even funnier, almost all of the female characters are kind of stereotypical. We have the tsundere, the cutesy maid, the childhood friend, the silent and shy one and we even have a trap! And I can tell you, that all of these characters are absolutely great. We all hate the stereotypes that IS: Infinite Stratos and almost all of JC Staff‚Äôs latest crappy anime give us, but guess what. These girls are amazing.  I started watching the series with not really liking everyone, but I ended this series with loving almost every character. They‚Äôre beautifully written, have great personalities, and they all end up way less stereotypical than you‚Äôd think they were at first. There just isn‚Äôt a single thing that you can hate about them. It‚Äôs like the complete opposite of School Days‚Äô characters. 
But the absolute star has to be our ‚ÄúMAD SCIENTIST‚Äù Okabe Rintarou. His personality is great, and he isn‚Äôt like every single other anime‚Äôs male main character: he isn‚Äôt dense, he isn‚Äôt afraid of girls and he doesn‚Äôt take shit from anyone. I mean, hell, how long has it been since we‚Äôve had a guy like this? 
Along with Steins;Gate‚Äôs awesome characters, we have beautiful performances of very talented seiyuu. We all know Miyano Mamoru is a great seiyuu, but his performance for Okabe has to be one of his most amazing ones to date. Miyano and his superb voice for Okabe will leave you laughing for several minutes multiple times. Imai Isami plays the tsundere for Steins;Gate, and she‚Äôs fairly good at it. She has a nice voice, even when she‚Äôs mad, but it‚Äôs better when she‚Äôs being kind. Hanazawa Kana does a great job at portraying the seemingly brainless Shiina Mayuri, but I have to admit, I‚Äôm kind of getting sick of this voice of her. I prefer she‚Äôd do some different roles now and then, like she did in Kannagi.
Kobayashi Yuu gives an outstanding performance as the show‚Äôs trap, but we‚Äôre used to that. Her ambiguous voice does its job once again. And Tamura Yukari definitely deserves an honorable mention, since she has delivered an absolutely amazing performance as Amane Suzuha. During one of the episodes, she expressed so much emotion, that I got all teary-eyed. I mean, I shed some manly tears. 
Steins;Gate‚Äôs soundtrack is nice, it fits the situations perfectly. It excels at giving amazing background music at the show‚Äôs most suspenseful scenes, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd be a lot less enjoyable without it. 
The bad thing about Steins;Gate is its sound effects. They sound INCREDIBLY dated, it‚Äôs like White Fox cut them straight out of a 90‚Äôs anime and just pasted them at the last moment using Windows Movie Maker. The most simple sound effects were horrible, like hitting someone or smashing a door. This annoyed me at times, but it didn‚Äôt take away any of the enjoyment this show has given me. 
And now, the show‚Äôs opening. I‚Äôm an avid Itou Kanako fan, so you probably could‚Äôve imagined that I went rabid when I heard the show‚Äôs opening theme song. It‚Äôs amazing. I can‚Äôt stop listening to it. And the opening animation fits the song perfectly. Props to the person that directed the opening, it‚Äôs a great start to an amazing episode of a superb anime.
The ending theme song, sung by Sakakibara Yui, who also voiced FES in Ch√§oS;HEAd which is also a singer in that anime/VN, fits the anime perfectly, whether it ended happily, with a cliffhanger or with something incredibly sad. 
The animation was, sadly, disappointing. Especially after 5pb‚Äôs producer told us through twitter that Steins;Gate would feature movie-like animation. Some of the scenes are beautifully animated, but when a scene has zoomed out characters, they‚Äôre drawn very ugly and you just can‚Äôt refrain from pointing out the errors and laughing at them. It also features awkward zooms on the characters‚Äô faces at times, which do work out most of the time, but sometimes it just looks plain bad. The anime also has dark and grey backgrounds, which feature no life at all and are mostly boring to look at. But well, that was expectable, since most of the anime takes place in a small room.
I know that I‚Äôm only naming the bad things right now, but Steins;Gate‚Äôs animation is pretty good. Let‚Äôs just say it works most of the time, and some of the scenes feature a peculiar style of art, animation and camera angles which look great.
Steins;Gate‚Äôs original character designs were handled by Huke, and he did a great job with it. It‚Äôs a pity that the anime production staff decided to not keep the VN‚Äôs original art choice, but it‚Äôs would‚Äôve been difficult to adapt that in a moving animation, so I do understand their choice. I do wish that they had kept the VN‚Äôs eye designs, since they were beautiful. And I thought they kept it too, after looking at several promotional images of the anime and seeing that they featured the VN‚Äôs awesome eye designs. Sadly, they weren‚Äôt there in the anime adaptation. But now I‚Äôm just nitpicking again.
SUMMARY:
Steins;Gate is a suspenseful ride that you will not forget any time soon after you‚Äôve finished watching it. It is so incredibly thrilling and it has so many plot twists and mind blowing events, that you‚Äôll hold your breath or scream at the screen multiple times. It features amazing voice acting performances by talented seiyuu and a great soundtrack, including the opening and the ending. You will end up loving all of this show‚Äôs characters, since they all of their own charm and they‚Äôre all incredibly likeable. 
The animation is fairly good, and the sound effects are incredibly dated, but don‚Äôt let that scare you off. Steins;Gate is a masterpiece. It will twist your emotions in multiple ways loads of times. It‚Äôs an absolute must-watch, and it‚Äôs definitely one of THE best thrillers in the history of anime.

                Let me start with some back story and then the actual review will follow.
About four years ago two Japanese video game companies, Nitroplus and 5pb., started a collaboration to make the world a better place with some neat visual novels. The first project came out of it was Ch√§oS;HEAd with its scenario written by Hayashi Naotaka-shi, a guy who worked on Remember11 and Memories Off series, if this means anything to you. In general Ch√§oS;HEAd turned out to be rather average novel and it lost most of its good parts in its anime adaptation; however, Ch√§oS;HEAd still has enough impressive ideas and nice concepts to
                  be memorable. And thanks to it I took my interest in Steins;Gate anime adaptation, when the word about it got out.
So, Steins;Gate, the second fruit of Nitroplus & 5pb. collaboration‚Äôs labour, is again written by Hayashi-shi. (I haven‚Äôt read the original novel, so I won‚Äôt reference it in my review.) The story revolves around a group of people who remodel their microwave into a device capable of sending text messages to the past. The first part of the series is dedicated to introduction of various characters and showing them fooling around with the microwave ‚Äî standard stuff. The enjoyment here mostly depends on how much sympathy do you have for the characters, so let‚Äôs take a quick look on the roster.
Hashida Itaru, a fat geek, otaku and ‚Äúsuper haker‚Äù. Calm, lazy and perverted, but won‚Äôt go as far as stealing woman‚Äôs pants to wear them on his head, which in fact makes him one of the most well-written geek characters in modern anime.
Shiina Mayuri, a moe girl, cheerful, merry and voiced by Hanazawa Kana-shi. Since I hear her a lot nowadays, her voice doesn‚Äôt sound as cute as it used to be a year ago, but still she does a nice work singing ‚Äútuttur≈´‚Äù on this role.
Makise Kurisu, a science genius and tsundere. She can be a bit clich√© because of her character definition, but becomes more complex and deep character as the series progresses, so I find her rather likeable and interesting sort of person.
There are, of course, more characters in the series and these three are not all of the important ones, but I can‚Äôt spend all my review listing them like some Wikipedia, so let‚Äôs proceed.
‚ÄúBut hey, wait, Tsunekicchi!‚Äù Some of you can interrupt me. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay to skip some of the characters, but you said nothing about the protagonist!‚Äù
Yep, right. That‚Äôs because I consider him so important that I‚Äôm going to give him a whole paragraph.
So, H≈ç≈çin Ky≈çma, or Okabe Rintar≈ç as some humie humans tend to call him, a lab-coat-wearing self-proclaimed mad scientist and, as I already mentioned, the protagonist of the series. Very original and distinctive, one can call him ‚Äúa parody of parody mad scientist characters‚Äù with all his feigned paranoid behaviour and maniacal laughter.  For me most of the fun in the show was delivered by Okabe‚Äôs interaction with other characters, his exaggerated reactions and fanatical devotion to the chosen stereotype. Of course, he is not there just for comic relief since he‚Äôs the protagonist, so you‚Äôll see another, serious and caring, side of his person. Personally I think that at least one third of its success Steins;Gate owes to this guy. (He shares my fondness for Dr Pepper, an intellectual drink for the chosen ones, so I can probably be a little partial while describing him. Just saying.)
Another great share of success is obtained by the second part of the show, where the pace of storytelling speeds up and most of plot twists happen and where the characters you probably grew to like face the problems their invention caused. And allow me to tell you, Steins;Gate is really good at drama. It‚Äôs been a long time since I last felt that way while watching anime, as this series is capable of triggering a lot of complex emotions, especially if you empathize with the characters.
Overall the stylistics of Steins;Gate leaves a nice feeling with all its culture references ranged from Back to the Future films to Large Hadron Collider, and with all its ‚Äúmake-believe science‚Äù and technobabble. Well, there are some things hard to swallow (compress 3.24 terabytes of data into 36 bytes using a black hole‚Ä¶ no, seriously, what the hell, Makise?), but as I always thought, the moment you‚Äôll start taking all fiction seriously your life is ruined.
Animation is rather nice and good looking. And regarding the soundtrack, it‚Äôs wonderful. Both the opening theme by It≈ç Kanako-shi (who appears in pretty much every Nitroplus-affiliated project) and the ending theme by Sakakibara Yui-shi (who I remember as seiy≈´ of Kishimoto Ayase, my favourite character from Ch√§oS;HEAd) sound magnificent and it was a pleasure to listen to them.
Okay, Steins;Gate is definitely worth watching, if you still hesitating. I will really miss this series (and looking forward to the film, of course). Steins;Gate is an impressive and influential piece of fiction, and one more thing I appreciate in it is that it brings back one of the classical sci-fi themes ‚Äî the rules and problems of time travel ‚Äî which is not common in modern anime. Plus Steins;Gate made me remember my favourite novel by Mr Isaac Asimov, as it has similar d√©nouement and triggers similar thoughts. Their plot is much different, however, but I still don‚Äôt want to mention the title of the novel for spoiler reasons just in case.
Phew, guys, I like a way too many aspects of Steins;Gate to rate it anything lower than 10 points, so nothing can be done here. Well-earned 10 points. El‚Ä¶ Psy‚Ä¶ Congroo.
P.S. Looks like Robotics;Notes, the upcoming third visual novel by Nitroplus & 5pb., deserves to be looked forward to. And it has story that deals with something like fighting games and robots. Ah, Japan, the Motherland of Ridiculous Plots!",10

                An anime as dull and flat as its colour palette.  
Well.. This was the most overhyped piece of trash anime I've seen in my life. Calling it a disappointment would be an understatement. I regret spending all those hours drudging through this dreary, pretentious show. Maybe I'm being overly critical and it's just a matter of it not aging well. After all, a lot of amazing sci-fi has been released since this anime first aired. Movies like Interstellar, Inception, and Edge of Tomorrow, hell even Looper (a movie nobody probably even remembers) all come to mind as having similar elements but being superior in
                  every way - from plot to character development to the underlying mechanics of time travel they choose to adopt. 
Steins gate is a badly disguised harem anime that tries to be whimsical and 'deep', but just comes across as cringey and shallow. The delusional grandiose ramblings of the MC somehow attracts a one dimensional tsundere with daddy issues, an intellectually disabled trumpet, a scantily clothed NEET, a trap shrine maiden, and a neko maid that ends every sentence with ""nyan"". Does anything else even need to be said? 
May as well right? It still can't be as exhausting as watching literally three quarters of this show where..nothing happens. The pacing is horrendous. I wanted to drop it so many times but the cult status and high ratings convinced me that it would be worth it if I stuck it out. No.. No it wasn't. The animation is boring and lacklustre, the sound is.. Wait there was sound? The overarching plot has potential but it's bogged down by its slow pace and unlikeable characters. 
The main character is truly an apt description for this show - an eighteen year old boy masquerading as a mad scientist trying to be more than what he is. As someone who loves the sci-fi genre, I strongly advise you to stay away from this show if you're looking for a cohesive plot, believable time travel mechanics, or characters that don't pander to a virgin weeb's wet dream.",3

                This is what should be considered as art, not what is considered as art nowadays. Sadly, nowadays among the majority of people, Anime is just considered as nonsensical and childish trash. It is drawn, so it is immature. This is what the majority thinks, and this is why it is normally difficult to find any Otaku living in near of you. It's a shame actually, that they will not experience this awesomeness, and obviously I am looking at Steins;Gate when I am saying that. Ironically, I've recently been pretty much the same, like, two or three months ago.  But I tried Anime and was
                  amazed. I hate myself for disliking Anime in the past because I thought it was immature, especially when Anime like Steins;Gate exist, which includes an immensely clever and emotional story. I love this Anime from the bottom of my heart, and really, I will slap the one who thinks that Steins;Gate is immature.
The plot of this Anime is really creative and clever as well. In fact, I have never seen something like this before. It's about a 17 year-old scientist, named Okabe Rintarou, who is highly intrigued of time travels and believes that they are possible, and meets a 18 year-old woman, named Makise Kurisu, who does not think so. In the beginning, he has three laboratory members. Hashida Itaru, also known as Daru, and Shiina Mayuri. During his research of time travels, he obtains more laboratory members due to the oddest situations. Once, in a scientific building, he saw the corpse of Makise Kurisu. He sent a E-Mail to Daru, and oddly, it says that he sent it one week ago. Confused, he concludes that the E-Mail was sent to the past, and right after his conclusion, he saw Makisa Kurisu alive, although he has seen her corpse.
Steins;Gate has done something none of the Anime I have seen so far has done. The story is absolutely consistent, it is totally flawless. Some parts of the story are really difficult to follow, and although the story is so complicated were mistakes are easily done, Steins;Gate did it perfectly. Even if haters were supposed to find a mistake in the story, they would fail. The story is absolutely flawless, and then it's even brilliant, too. The only thing I failed to understand is how everything that is written in a D-Mail will automatically be realized. In the past, it would have the same effect as a E-Mail, so that fact should be clarified, but maybe I just missed it. Nonetheless, you can dislike the story, but never say it is a flaw.
The story is interesting all the way, but you will easily get lost, so when you are watching Steins;Gate, make sure you do not turn  your brain completely off and concentrate in order to understand the story decently. If you understand it, you will see why it is so clever, and it is actually really interesting, too, especially how the time travel theories would actually make sense, even though it is impossible to do. It sounds like it would actually work, which is quite interesting.
While the pacing might feel really slow in the first twelve episodes, after you watched them and look back to what happened, you recognize that they have actually accomplished more than it feels. If the creators would try to make the pacing feel faster, it would probably end up horribly rushed, so actually, even if it feels sometimes the opposite, the pacing is perfect. This Anime gives you the feeling that it will always go on like that, but it would end up having 12 or 13 episodes, would not be dramatic at all, wouldn't be as popular as it is, and SERN would feel completely out of place. The plot-twist in episode 12 was definitely surprising, but it was amazing. It feels like now it would get deeper in the thriller genre and comedy will totally be left out, but it is interesting how Steins;Gate does actually never loose its comedy. It doesn't feel out of place and it's actually really hilarious as well.
There is one aspect Steins;Gate lacks at immensely - the character development. Actually, only Okabe Rintarou and Makise Kurisu are developing slightly, but their personalities never change. To be honest, character development in Steins;Gate was not too necessary, though. It is always refreshing to see how the characters are always the same, and it is good that the only existing character development in this Anime doesn't change the personalities and the comedy. Every character has an unique personality, which is cool and/or hilarious in various ways. Okabe for instance, gives everyone odd nicknames (including himself) and has odd habits, but is serious when necessary. No secondary character feels actually out of place and plays a fair role, and most of them hide a certain secret as well.
Every character has an unique appearance and seems to never actually change its clothes. Okabe wears always his laboratory coat, while Mayuri wears always the same hat and dress. Kurisu always wears her pullover so, that it doesn't cover her shoulders, and Daru's clothes are pretty much Standard. Mayuri's eyebrows look strange, but I guess it has a purpose. As far as I know, ""mayu"" is Japanese and means ""eyebrow"" in English, so that is probably their intention. The animation is usually not bad nor good, but there are situations where the animation is wonderful. In Anime the animation tends to be occasionally particularly fluid, and Steins;Gate is no exception. The art is a true eye-candy. It looks truly outstanding. The eyes look a little bit strange, but it is tolerable. The backgrounds are mostly detailed create a decent atmosphere. 
The Seiyuu cast has done an amazing job. Okabe's voice fits just perfectly for a mad scientist, and Kurisu's voice sounds great and fitting as well. Mayuri's voice is also amazing and fits perfectly, too, not to mention Daru's voice. They definitely made proper choices and they do not sound lifeless or emotionless at all, they have an accurate sound and even emotional scenes were well done. The sound effects are greatly done as well. In this Anime in these special situations, the sound effects are of course special, too, but they sound logical.
There is only one opening, while in the last two episodes have, the opening was modified with the lyrics of the full version, which sound better in my opinion and is a great idea. Nonetheless, the opening is probably one of the most amazing ones I have ever heard. The singer has a great voice, and the same applies to the ending, too, though in the last episodes there were different endings, too. Episode 23's ending is definitely one of the best songs I have ever heard. The lyrics are decent as well. As for the background soundtrack, it's definitely one of the bests out here. While most of the tracks do not sound really particular, which are always the comedy and science background musics, they fit pretty well and do not sound bad, too. The important themes are those which are used in emotional scenes, and nobody can complain about those themes, since every single one sounds utterly amazing.
This is so far the best Anime I have ever seen. You do not have to be into Sci-Fi to like it, it is actually for everyone. It has a really brilliant and emotional story, decorated with wonderfully executed comedy moments, which were simply genius and made me laugh every single time. The characters are definitely the bests I have seen so far as well, even though the character development was missing, but every character was hilarious and cool. No character is actually annoying and even the secondary characters give a fair input. Everyone has to watch this Anime, simply everyone. What you will see in this Anime is awesomeness on the highest level, and in all seriousness, I could describe this Anime almost as a drug. I can not get enough of it. I want more, more, more and more. I seriously can not wait for the upcoming movie and I will make sure to review it as well.",10

                I'm just going to go ahead and say its overhyped to hell. Its not that it's a bad show, it was a enjoyable experience. But certainly not without its flaws as its ratings or most reviews would suggest.
My biggest gripe with Steins;Gate is that, as an engineering student, at no point was the suspension of disbelief at the science in its science fiction, or the logic of its plot (or the soundness of its explanations) effortless. It is a good show, but not as science fiction. I don't want to include any spoilers but I will say this, at times I couldn't help myself audibly
                  chuckling and saying ""bullshit"" after hearing long-winded explanations of its in-universe sci-fi. There are quite a few glaring plot holes in the show, and the series relies on deus ex machinas on more than one occasion to dig itself out of dead-ends its written itself into. THAT SAID, none of that matters if you can overlook it. Do not go into steins;gate for Sci-Fi and that still does not qualify it as a bad show. For story I would rate it good(7), but only because it was at least original and did have some really great moments and twists. 
In every other department however, Steins;Gate excelled. In hindsight, it really is something that this show took such a hilariously varied and mismatching cast of characters and managed to make them so believable and mesh together so effortlessly. The interactions between them were endearing and well written; full of charm, wit and  chemistry, taking you through the full spectrum of emotions. You can't help but grow attached.
The show's relied on its cast so much that for long lengths of the show, nothing really progressing the plot happened at all, yet it still feels unfair to call it filler. In these parts the show doesn't seem to try at all, the events portrayed being completely laid back and banal, yet still infinitely interesting and hilarious. The comedy of Steins;Gate is facile in manner and doesn't even seem forced even when referencing internet memes and otaku culture, which is not an easy thing to do. Houoin Kyouma and company would definitely find a place in any list of favourite characters of mine. For cast, Steins;Gate recieves a solid 9(Great)
The art of Steins;Gate was gorgeous, the character designs unique and refreshing and the animation was fluid. You could at parts tell there were budget constraints but overall, what they managed to do was more than adequate easily deserves an 8(Very Good). 
The voice acting was superb, and even in the english dub, it was hardly disappointing. In fact, I'm going to even go far enough to say that FUNimation and their VAs put their whole heart and soul into this dub and managed to produce something very quality. I personally have heard both and can't find myself being able to choose one that is objectively better. 
The music was very minimal in Steins;Gate and the OST does not consist of many songs. At the moments, it does though, it stands out and is brilliant. ""Gate of Steiner"" and ""Believe me"" being my favourite tracks. The ED was also very appropriate and in-general a good song. I personally didn't like the OP very much though, but that is my opinion. For sound, I give it a 7(Good).
For total enjoyment, I give Steins;Gate an 8. It definitely is something worth watching.",8
"
                When you walk the streets of Akihabara, you‚Äôre bound to run into many weird things.  As the mecca of the otaku world, this district isn‚Äôt just a major electronics shopping center.  In addition to supplying you with anime merchandise for all ages(and I do mean ALL ages, including those quite a bit older than 18), you‚Äôre also likely to find cosplayers, concerts, maid cafes, an entire AKB0048 theater, and enough sexual imagery to make anyone not used to the culture believe they had fallen down the rabbit hole into a perverse misogynistic wonderland.
And yet even the people who have been used to this
                  atmosphere their entire lives have no idea how to react to one of it‚Äôs most strange residents, the self-proclaimed mad scientist HOUEN KYOUMA!  By all outward appearances, Kyouma...  Or, Okabe Rintaro by birth...  Is an 18 year old man-child who refers to himself in the third person and always talks as though he‚Äôs unveiling his latest diabolic trap for Superman.  They think he‚Äôs delusional, but little do they...  Or even Okabe himself...  realize just accurate his claims are.  As crazy as he may sound, Okabe has, through some miracle of science, accidentally created a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past.  Will this inexplicable invention be his ticket to the fame and notoriety that he‚Äôs always imagined, or will it be the greatest mistake he‚Äôs ever made?
Steins;Gate was produced by a relatively new animation studio called White Fox, and out of the dozen shows that they‚Äôve put out, I unfortunately have only seen two others.  They did The Devil is a Part Timer, which I highly recommend, but they also did Akame Ga Kill, I show I dropped after seven episodes.  Both shows looked good despite having low budgets, and the same can be said of Steins;Gate.  It‚Äôs not a very expensive show, which is fine, because it doesn‚Äôt need to be.  The vast majority of it is dialogue heavy, alternating from people standing around talking to people walking around talking...  Or, in it‚Äôs cheapest moments, people standing around thinking or brooding.  It uses a lot of framing and perspective tricks to make these slower moments look less dull, and while I‚Äôd normally call a show pretentious for doing this, Steins;Gate never comes close to as bad with it as most Studio Shaft productions can get.
When something other than talking is going on...  Say, during the more exciting moments of the show, of which there is a generous amount...  There isn‚Äôt a spike in the budget, like there would be with most shows, but they use a lot of clever editing tricks so the movement on screen appears more fluid than it really is, which I really appreciate...  After all, a well-managed small budget will almost always impress me more than an unrestrained big budget.  The character designs, while somewhat simplistic, are memorable enough.  The characters don‚Äôt exactly look realistic, but in the anime medium, they‚Äôre about as grounded and non-cartoony as you can get, one weird moe-girl aside.  The color scheme is dull, but it plays very well to the mature aesthetic of the series.
Aside from the really quick and beautiful animations that happen whenever Okabe time travels, there‚Äôs nothing really special about the look of this series, distinctive and unique though it might be, but it works perfectly in context, and any more movement than it has would have just felt unnecessary.  
The music is also barely noticeable, skulking around in the background of scenes as it does it‚Äôs job accentuating the tone of the show without ever standing out.  If you‚Äôre actually listening for it, the instrumental portion of the soundtrack is comprised primarily of soft piano pieces, although it‚Äôs not afraid to get loud and bombastic during it‚Äôs more intense scenes.  In terms of both music and animation, Steins;Gate never gets more awesome than it does with it‚Äôs opening theme, Hacking to the Gate, one of my favorite openings of the decade so far.  Having said that, this is one of those rare moments where I wish the series had split itself into two different openings, as Hacking to the Gate, with it‚Äôs fast pace, explosive tune and clock-related imagery overlaying unhappy characters in a way that makes them feel hopelessly trapped in time feels way too intense for the first half of the series.  Nevertheless, it‚Äôs pretty damn awesome.
The English dub is a Funimation effort, which is normally a good sign...  Except for when they hire J. Michael Tatum as the script writer.  I ragged on him really hard in my Heroic Age review, and I still stand behind everything I said...  He‚Äôs a pretentious writer who thinks he‚Äôs better than the material, and makes a lot of really bad choices because of it.  In spite of this, his style is more or less perfect for a show like Steins;Gate, whose dialogue poses, tries to sound smarter than it is, and panders to the audience just as hard as Tatum does.  It made incessant references to Sci-Fi and nerd culture in the original Japanese, and Tatum clearly had a lot of fun Americanizing these references, throwing in nods to Star Trek, Doctor Who, and internet memes that fit well in context...  Mostly.  There are some quotes...  For example, a Leeroy Jenkins reference in the final episode...  that feel so out of place that you can‚Äôt help but notice Tatum‚Äôs giant wink to the audience.
His passion for over-writing also finds it‚Äôs home here, as a character like Okabe can only improve as his dialogue becomes more stilted and over-the-top.  There are a few moments that do go way too far, one of the worst of which is a confrontation that Kurisu has with her father, who‚Äôs lines were so bad that the actor himself doesn‚Äôt sound comfortable reading them.  Aside from that, it mostly works, and there are only a few moments where different characters sound the same(Mayuri and Dabu both using the phrase ‚ÄúInterwebs,‚Äù for instance.  Stop trying to sound cool, Tatum).
Fortunately, the acting in general is above par.  Tatum actually sounds slightly better in the lead role than Mamoru Miyano did, which is a real feat when you consider just how awesome Miyano was with the character.  Being able to both write and act as an over-the-top melodramatic nut-job like Okabe was clearly a huge inspiration for him, and he takes it to gleeful extremes.  The only actor in the cast who really surpasses him is Trina Nishimura in the role of Kurisu, the show‚Äôs only truly scientific-sounding character.  She plays her with a reserved dignity that smooths out any tsundere edge that the character may have had, and she pulls off Kurisu‚Äôs emotional nuance flawlessly.  She‚Äôs the rock of Okabe‚Äôs team, and Trina makes you believe it.
Jad Saxton and Cherami Leigh do wonderful jobs as usual.  They‚Äôre both basically playing characters that they‚Äôve played several times before, so this is well-known ground for them, and their veteran instincts carry them through.  Relative newcomer Jessica Cavanaugh had a disproportionately tough job with the character of Moeka, who spend the majority of the series speaking quietly and delivering very few lines, but then suddenly having to scream hysterically at the top of her lungs in her big episode, so I have to give her props for pulling it off.  As for Daru and Mayuri...  Well, let‚Äôs just say the actors did the best they could to make them less annoying.
The characters are acted well over-all, which is a good thing, because the sad truth is that they‚Äôre not written very well.  There are a handful of good or likeable characters, but there are only two in the main cast that I didn‚Äôt have any serious problems with...  Moeka, the cell phone girl, and Suzuha, the part-timer.  They‚Äôre both tied very tightly to the plot, and while they initially meander for much of the first half, they don‚Äôt disappoint in the long run.  Also, neither one is after Okabe‚Äôs dick.
The two main characters, Okabe and Kurisu, are really likeable.  Okabe is an interesting and highly dynamic character, and he has a great developmental arc throughout the story, but he‚Äôs not believable.  He represents two of Japans more recent social issues...  He‚Äôs a NEET, or ‚ÄúNot in Employment or Educational Training(at least in the anime),‚Äù and he‚Äôs also a chuunibyo, or an adult who can‚Äôt let go of his childhood fantasies.  And yet, his weird and socially inept ways are justified by the fact that he‚Äôs made one of the most important inventions of all time, and he has three very attractive people so in love with him that they‚Äôre willing to do horrible things to themselves just because he asked them to.  Hell, he even has a best friend who‚Äôs a complete skeezwad otaku just so he can look dignified by comparison.  He‚Äôs the perfect self-insert fantasy for the very people he‚Äôs representing.
And Kurisu?  Yes, she‚Äôs awesome, but she‚Äôs supposed to be awesome.  She‚Äôs awesome by design, and I don‚Äôt mean that in a good way.  She‚Äôs a nerd‚Äôs perfectly idealized girlfriend.  Even if it weren‚Äôt for her cool head, high tolerance level for absurd people, and laid back personality, she‚Äôs still that unrealistic fantasy girl who‚Äôs willing to look past your awkwardness and terrible first impression just because your differences from other people are charming to her.  I firmly disagree with anybody who calls her a tsundere, as she only acts abrasively towards Okabe when he deserves it for antagonizing her, but she‚Äôs still basically a magical girlfriend without the magic.
Then you have Faris and Ruka, whom...  And I‚Äôm sorry to say this...  The show would be better off without.  Their only two purposes in the story are to extend the plot by a few episodes and be Okabe‚Äôs other two love interests, and they‚Äôre both very problematic in their own ways.  With Faris, we never find out exactly why she has such a high opinion of Okabe...  I mean, if she was just playing along with his BS because he‚Äôs a customer, that would be fine, but we get no indication of that.  And the idea of a teenage girl being indirectly responsible for the development of Akihabara‚Äôs moe culture is a whole other can of worms.
And Ruka...  Well, anime normally isn‚Äôt kind with it‚Äôs portrayal of LGBT characters, but this one crosses a brand new line.  He...  Well, she, I guess?  She‚Äôs a biological male who identifies as a female.  She uses the time machine to change her gender to the one that feels right, and while her character does involve some ignorant stereotypes, it doesn‚Äôt really become a problem until Okabe asks her to change herself back for plot reasons, to which her response is basically ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll go back to my old miserable life in order to prevent a greater tragedy from happening...  If you go on a date with me!‚Äù  Holding the greater good hostage just to spend some time with our favorite awkward adonis.  And of course she‚Äôs also in love with him when she‚Äôs a boy, because stereotypes.
I‚Äôve already mentioned in Okabe‚Äôs description what Daru‚Äôs role in the series is, although I do appreciate the attempt to develop him further through his relationship to Suzuha.  But Mayuri is the worst.  No, let me rephrase that:  Mayuri is THE WORST, all capitals.  She‚Äôs a doe-eyed infantilized moe blob, or basically a toddler with big boobs.  Aside from humanizing Okabe, her purpose is to make the viewer feel like she needs to be protected, thus adding more emotional stakes to the second half of the series.
If you haven‚Äôt seen the show, but have heard a lot of word of mouth about it, you‚Äôve probably heard something along these lines;  ‚ÄúThe first half was really slow, but when the second half kicked in, it became the most awesome thing ever!‚Äù  Or something of the like.  I don‚Äôt personally agree with that assessment...  The pacing of the first half never bothered me, and the second half had more than enough problems that I‚Äôll get to in a minute...  But what I do take issue with is when people refer to it as one of the smartest shows they‚Äôve ever seen.  Now, I‚Äôm not saying Steins;Gate is a dumb show...  It knows what it‚Äôs doing, and to that end, it never falters...  What I‚Äôm saying is that it‚Äôs full of shit.  
I can‚Äôt say much about it‚Äôs time travel logic without giving away too many spoilers, but it does cheat towards the end and go in the Back to the Future direction.  What I can talk about is the huge turning point that everybody loves so much.  Halfway through the series, a tragic event occurs, and Okabe starts using the time machine over and over again to try and prevent said tragedy, but his efforts prove futile.  This is fine at first, until it‚Äôs revealed that even when the cause of the tragedy is completely removed, the tragedy still happens in all of it‚Äôs Final Destination glory.  Frankly, if you can get through this story arc without even once saying ‚ÄúOh My God, They Killed Kenny!‚Äù, then this show has you by the short and curlies.
Since Steins;Gate is a Sci-Fi story, there are a lot of things it doesn‚Äôt need to explain...  It is, after all, Science fiction, not science fact.  It doesn‚Äôt bother to explain how a Microwave can send texts through time, but it doesn‚Äôt need to, because no time machine in the history of fiction has ever been fully explained.  They give you a few details and you just take it on faith.  It never explains how Okabe got his Reading Steiner ability, or the ability to retain his memories from alternate timelines, but it doesn‚Äôt need to, because Okabe‚Äôs the main character, and he needs to have some element of chosen-ness in order to be special.  As far as these two details go, everything‚Äôs fine.
But if you‚Äôre going to insert a giant game-changing plot twist into the middle of a story, it has to follow some sort of in-universe logic.  The tragic event I mentioned earlier does not.  It never gets explained as anything other than an accepted repercussion of time travel.  I guess the best way to describe it would be to imagine that you‚Äôre stacking dominoes, and you have a pit of lava in your living room.  I don‚Äôt know why, just go with it.  No matter where you aim the line-up of dominoes, the last one will inevitably land in the lava, regardless of what room it ends in.  Now, a normal person would be curious...  Is Chell playing a joke on you?  But Okabe and Kurisu are not curious.  They immediately accept it as a scientific inevitability, and immediately jump to possible solutions, probably to save the writers the effort of coming up with a reason for this conflict that still smells like the place they pulled it out of.  Hell, even a stupid explanation like ‚ÄúOkabe‚Äôs meddling with life and death pissed off the Grim Reaper‚Äù would have been a better explanation than no explanation.
And if that‚Äôs not bad enough, the idea of other people retaining their memories of past timelines through flashbacks is bullshit.  There are several moments where characters that Okabe‚Äôs interacting with have visions of their past lives to corroborate with what he‚Äôs telling them, and of course, it only ever occurs when it‚Äôs convenient for him.  He tries to explain it by saying that everybody has Reading Steiner to some degree, but this makes no sense whatsoever.  I can think of any number of characters who, if they retained certain memories from past timelines, would have been able to screw Okabe and his friends over six ways from sunday.
Now, I know I‚Äôve been very negative in those last few paragraphs, and that‚Äôs because I was saying things I haven‚Äôt heard often, and that I felt needed to be said.  But the truth is, Steins;Gate does more right than it does wrong.  It‚Äôs adapted from a light novel/dating game, which is a notoriously hard source to adapt from, and while it‚Äôs attempts to build stories out of two of the side characters‚Äô romantic paths does make for some infuriating filler episodes, it still weaves a better story than any other light novel based anime that I‚Äôve seen.  I haven‚Äôt played the original game, but from what I‚Äôve heard, they left a lot of the more ridiculous content by the wayside.
I also appreciate the slow pace of the first half a lot more than other people I‚Äôve talked to about it.  Steins;Gate did a great job slowly developing the story and dipping it‚Äôs characters further and further down the rabbit hole, dropping subtle clues about the disaster to come when the story gets serious.  The build-up is fantastic, and the relationship between the characters and their interactions with each other kept me from ever getting bored.  Yes, I said the characters are calculated and unrealistic in the way they‚Äôre written, but the friendship and chemistry between them does feel real, and it comes from a very believable place, so I can‚Äôt completely write them off.  Not most of them, anyway.
Nor can I write off the overall story.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the work of pure genius everyone else does...  Sorry, I don‚Äôt...  But it‚Äôs still a pretty damn good mystery, with enough build-up and payoff to keep you on the edge of your seat from episode to episode even after multiple viewings, noticing small, seemingly insignificant details you might have missed on previous viewings.  It‚Äôs at it‚Äôs best when it‚Äôs focused on this mystery, and to that effect, it‚Äôs executed really well...  And even when it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs emotionally resonant enough for it‚Äôs flaws to be largely excusable.  But as a sci-fi time traveling show, it really does make shit up as it goes along.
Steins;Gate is available from Funimation.  It was originally released in blu-ray/DVD combo half-packs, but it has since been released as one product in the Anime classics format, and for a much more affordable rate than before.  The original visual novel has been released stateside for several formats including the PS3, with the text actually translated, but I haven‚Äôt played it and probably won‚Äôt for a while.  The 2013 movie, Fuka Ryoiki No Deja Vu, has not yet been released stateside, but it has been licensed by Funimation, and good news:  It‚Äôs not a cash-grab movie!  It‚Äôs an actual sequel!  A sequel series named Steins;Gate 0 has been announced, and appears to be set in an alternate universe that Okabe left behind.
You can love an anime series while impartially acknowledging that it has problems, and that‚Äôs the camp I find myself in with this series.  Steins;Gate doesn‚Äôt really live up to all of the hype, nor does it deserve it, but it‚Äôs still a pretty awesome series.  It‚Äôs well produced and cleverly directed, and it‚Äôs original enough that I can honestly say I‚Äôve never seen any series like it before.  I guess it kind of reminds me of Angel Beats, insofar as the fact that it works far better emotionally than logically, but that‚Äôs pretty much it.  The comedy and drama are blended well, but it‚Äôs just too problematic for me to give it the high mark it‚Äôs clearly aiming for.  Just like all of Okabe‚Äôs friends, I accept this show and all of it‚Äôs weirdness and pretense.  I give Steins;Gate a 7/10.",7

                Who knew physics, that story boring as hell taught by our high school fat teacher would be so cool?
No, my little friends, I do not hate physics. In fact, quite the contrary: I have always been fascinated by the crazy theories that modern physics has brought us, especially in the areas of Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology. It was due to this personal interest that led me to seek Steins; Gate. Incidentally, let us say in passing, with great delay. Another one joined the list ""Animes that should have watched before.""
The major plot of the anime is nothing less than the big taboo popularized by
                  Einstein: Time travel. Yes, for those who are unaware of it or find it funny, time travel is theoretically possible, we just do not have such technology. Yet. Perhaps this is one of the most fascinating things in the anime.
The story of Steins; Gate takes place in a laboratory Akihabara, having as protagonists physicists Rintaro Okabe, the self-proclaimed Mad Scientist Houin Kyoma and Makise Kurisu, a young prodigy who is in japan passing.
We have as great antagonist anime none other than the SERN! Yes, you've heard? The SERN, or European Organization for Nuclear Research does exist. It is the largest particle physics laboratory in the world, famous for having developed the LHC in 2007, an instrument that would try to collide particles at the speed of light, much feared by their risk of eventual generation of a Black Hole, which once created would expand indefinitely to suck our planet and everything in it orbits.
Warning them of the forehand: you will find the beginning of the anime a little confusing. But do not worry, it's normal. A tip that I give you here is simple: do not worry about understanding the story in the first episode, but try to remember the details displayed on it, because later they will be resumed.
With 24 episodes, the anime is divided into two parts: the first, in which the pair of scientists, together with team mates from the laboratory is focused on the research and development methods of time travel, very light and funny, practically a Slice of Life of a crazy guy doing scientific experiments. Incidentally, here's one of the great successes of the anime: Steins; Gate can have a really clever comedy and very good, without having to resort to clich√©s resources like little songs, beatings, moe and other inductive methods to laughter. In the second part of the anime it changes dramatically: turns into drama, become sad and full of action and suspense at the same time.
If you've seen the movie The Butterfly Effect, will definitely familiarize yourself with the second part, since the anime also addresses, in a much more evidently that part of physics belonging to Chaos Theory. And it would be impossible not to talk. It's practically a consequentialist logic: changing certain fact already accomplished generates thus a Butterfly Effect.
Steins; Gate is an anime for those seeking thrills: is an anime to laugh, cry and even gasp with certain events that happen throughout the episodes.
Do not miss it.

                Steins;Gate Review:
This show can be described with one word: Brilliant. My 9 rating is deceiving however. For me, I tend to enjoy almost any show I watch. Some more than others. You will be hard pressed to find me giving a show anything under a 5, but at the same time it's not like I hand out 8 or higher rankings. Anything above an 8 for me is truly a remarkable piece of work and a must watch. once you get to the 9 ranking, the anime has blown me away in all aspects and is a true masterpiece. A ten... well that is territory
                  that only a true otherworldly anime can receive. For me, this show is more like a 9.5 than a nine (which obviously says a lot). But enough with my rambling, on to the review!
Story 10/10:
Now, Steins;Gate is yes, a time travel story. But, unlike most other shows, this anime doesn't just use the time travel as a plot device, but instead, time travel IS the center of the plot. Because of this, and the well written background behind the time travel concept itself, the plot is truly intriguing. We follow a self proclaimed ""mad scientist"", Rintarou Okabe, and his fellow members of the future gadget lab as they accidentally invent a time machine that can send texts back in time, and thus, alter events in the past. Obviously, by changing the past, they change the future, and must in the end try to fix it. What makes this seemingly cliche story unique is how our main character is the only one who seems to remember the ""world line"" before AND after they have been altered. Because of this, he is the only one who can fix the mistakes that they have made. Watching Okabe struggle through a multitude of timelines, repeating things over and over trying to get them right is fascinating. Now, the first few episodes are just plain ridiculous at first, and will make absolutely no sense until, you watch further into the show. I was inclined to drop the show after the first episode because it made absolutely no sense, however, if you stick through it, it will all piece itself together to become a brilliant storyline. Although many of the plot twists are very predictable, how they are dealt with is not, and will without a doubt keep you on the edge of your seat. To go along with the suspense, there is plenty of comedy, romance, and sadness too mix it up. It isn't the best at any of these other areas, but the show does a very good job with these areas none the less, and they are mixed in well with all the suspense to keep you from having a stroke. The show is somewhere between over the top, and not crazy enough. The setting is in an average city, primarily in a small apartment, and its not like random characters are popping out of nowhere like in some other shows, but at the same time, you are dealing with a very complex time travel plot. I really feel like words can't do this shows story justice, so just watch for yourslef!
Art 8/10:
I found Steins;Gate's visuals to be good. The character art is all borrowed from the visual novel, and looks as modern and up to today's standards as any anime. Movements and other animations were fluid and seemed natural, same goes for the lip movements. My only complaint is that the characters seemed to all only have one outfit each. It's not a big deal since many anime have this problem though so it is easily overlooked.
Sound 9/10:
The overall sound of the show was great. My one complaint was that damn cricket noise that seems to be in every anime I watch. It's in like every show and annoys the crap out of me... Anyways, the music during the show is kept at a low volume most of the time or made more for ambiance to set the tone of the show. All of the trAcks fit the scene perfectly and although subtle, they still evoke suspense/curiosity/sadness, in the scene. The real star of the ost though is the opening, ""Hacking to the Gate."" This is definitely my favorite opening song to an anime and is catchy as hell. As far as voice acting is concerned, in the dub version I found all of the voice actors to have done a great job. I don't really see any weak links and think that Okabe was voiced brilliantly.
Characters 9/10:
The characters in Steins;Gate are an interesting bunch to say the least. We have the crazy, but not as crazy as he thinks main character. The genius girl from America who argues with the main character all the time. The cute, innocent childhood friend. The fat, perverted, anime obsessed hacker. The cool, mysterious girl. The cosplaying waitress girl. The absolutely crazy girl who likes to text. And that's about it. On their own, each character isn't that special. But the interactions they have with each other, particularly those between Okabe and Kurisu Makise, bring out unexpected sides from the characters and really make you enjoy watching them. The intriguing plot line, and time travel element only enhances the strength of the characters as well because you get to see them remaining true to themselves even as (unknown to all but Okabe) the worldliness are changing around them. My one gripe is that the back stories of most of the characters aren't well developed, but really when the plot is about jumping around in time, adding another time period into the picture could complicate things beyond the writers' control.
Enjoyment 10/10:
Between Okabe and Makise's exchanges, the brain frying complexities of time travel, and the suspense of the story, there was never a moment after the dreadful episode 1 that I didn't thoroughly enjoy myself. By the second half of the show I was on the edge of my seat for each episode. This show made many laugh plenty of times, and although the show didn't manage to make me cry, i was still VERY sympathetic to the characters as they dealt with hardships. However, what made this show so enjoyable was the suspense and the intriguing story that gave birth to it. Steins;Gate made me actually care about what happened in the plot, and made me want to see everything work out for Okabe.
Overall (9.5/10):
It doesn't matter what kind if show you think you like. You will love this one. This show wasn't perfect. But it was pretty damn close. It had almost everything you could ask for in an anime without overdoing anything. Action, drama, comedy, suspense, oh god suspense! I feel kind of guilty for not giving this anime a 10. I have been changing my mind over and over on whether or not it should be. I decided since that because there was a small bit of doubt, I would give it a 9. Perhaps in another worldline, myanimelist allows the use of decimals in user reviews. Howeverm in this world line they don't, so I will have to leave this anime with a ""mere"" 9. If I could though, I would give it a 9.5. 
Verdict:
Fantastic. A show that will keep you on the edge of your seat while your brain fries like an omelette. A must watch for everyone.
Pros:
+ Brilliant story
+ Concept and use of time travel actually works
+ Greatest opening song ever
+ Suspenseful as f**k
Cons:
- Minor flaws in character development and art
- Some minor, barely significant plot holes are left unanswered
If you liked Steins;Gate, watch...
Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica:
It's hard to get too into why they are similar without spoilers, but trust me... both of these shows are brilliant and can be extremely similar at times when it comes to edge of your seat excitement in a dark form.
Clannad After Story:
If you enjoyed the romantic aspect of Steins;Gate, do not hesitate to watch Clannad. Regardless of what you like, I recommend Clannad, but there were definite similarities between these shows in terms of the tragic romance department.
9.5/10 - Brilliant",9

                What Steins;Gate does can accurately be described as pandering. It panders with such gusto that the anime has been confused with a masterpiece by a fanbase that is spellbound by being spoon-fed memes and eccentricity. People have heaped so much praise for this show that the glaring blemishes of its characters and pacing are neglected, so time to attempt to change that. Keep in mind, this is a good show, it's just not flawless!
The story's protagonist has about as much trouble picking a name as this show has picking a genre. Okabe ""Hououin Kyouma, Okarin"" Rintarou is a supposed mad scientist who operates in a
                  quaint apartment, which he so endearingly calls a lab. Mayuri Shiina, his personal sidekick, mindless husk, and jailbait also works with him, along with his fat hacker, otaku, and token pervert, Itaru Hashida. They call it a lab, the viewer can call it purgatory, because the next eleven episodes consist of listening to these characters talking about noodles, bananas, anime, and internet memes.
Anyway, somewhere amid mind-numbing dialogue, the maid cafe replete with cat ears, perverted jokes, and other hijinks, they invent a way to send text messages through time and change the present. Finally, what follows is the science-fiction thriller that was teased by the first episode. Still, this is time travel, so you basically know what to expect from the story: something that is relatively pointless as a whole, because time travel means no development is permanent. Unfortunately, while the pace certainly does recover and redeem itself from its slog of a first half, its characters and setting do not.
Okabe, Mayuri, Itaru, and later Kurisu, a blatant tsundere, are the most transparent characters you can find in anime, not just because they're generic, but because they exist solely to milk the audience. Okabe is the least offensive of them, but for half the show he doesn't act like a human. He is a walking weird-machine, there only to bring a contrasting spirit to the otherwise extremely monotonous cast of characters. 50% of all dialogue scenes can be summarized in three steps: Okabe says something whimsical, Kirisu protests him, then Itaru puts him down sarcastically. More distracting than this obvious formula is that Okabe is really only there because anime fans tend to view themselves as eccentric and awkward geniuses, themselves. Hence, every time Okabe gives a villainous laugh or says something extraordinary it's because absolutely nothing else is interesting about the scene, not as a result of an emotion or thought like a human being.
Speaking of humans, why didn't one write a personality for Mayuri? Oh, because she's only there to be cute for the audience and to be harassed by Itaru, who's the most unforgivable sin of Steins;Gate and the sole reason the dialogue scenes are so unbearable. The writers must have gone down the checklist of demographics and saw they were missing a character who spouted memes, so they threw in a fat guy who just happens to be tech-savvy. Not only that, but Itaru's a pervert, as well. How convenient to have so many comedic cliches in one character! Unfortunately, fat, try-hard, obsessed virgins are extremely difficult to like, and comedy doesn't work when you've already heard the punch-lines, kind of like how tsunderes don't work when that's their only trait. Kurisu, who's a red-headed mate for Okabe, plays hard to get for the entire show until she decides not to anymore. Anime fans enjoy when an elusive, intriguing mate succumbs to their geeky charms, right? Her eyes are as empty as her character.
Did I say empty eyes? Well, that's the trademark art style of this masterpiece. Since the characters are empty, anyway, the artist apparently decided to give everyone in the show empty, soul-less features. Naturally, this extends to the colors of the show, which have all received the Harry-Potter treatment. That is, every last bit of color and energy has been siphoned from the show to make it more stylish. Everything is a pale blue or bright yellow, which gives Steins;Gate a presence of light and darkness, which works well when paired with the unique, doll-like appearance of many of the characters, but also makes things pretty drab to look at, too.
So, are you a nerd who needs to live vicariously through characters who do nothing but try to ingratiate themselves to you? Perhaps you're thinking time travel is cool, but you'd really like it in the form of a slice-of-life anime? Maybe you're tired of characters who have reasons for what they do, instead of just doing things because they seems wacky? Or maybe you want characters to talk nerdy to you because your anime club's been extra stinky and pretty full of hormones lately? Well, Steins;Gate might be for you. After all, it's certainly trying to be!",7

                ""It's an intellectual drink for the chosen ones."" -Okabe about Dr. Pepper.
Well, where can I begin? Too many things can be said about this anime.
I didn't play at the VN, so there some things that I don't know.
Okay, let's resume the story first. All the review may contain spoiler, especially one part. 
Okabe Rintarou, also known as Hououin Kyouma, the auto-proclaimed mad scientist. That's the main character. His laboratory contains three members: him, Daru also known as Super-hacker, and Mayuri (Mayushii). In this laboratory, they developed what they've called ""Future Gadget"", all a bit strange, with epic names.
At the beginning, they met Makise Kurisu, a
                  young clever scientist.
One of the machine developed by Okabe is the phone microwave [name subject to change]. They do some experimentation on this machine. In fact, they discover something. This machine is a time machine.
Here begin the story, a fight to change the future by altering the past, more or less.
Now I'll explain one or two things that seem to be weird in my mind. This part contain spoilers.
As a lot of anime, Steins;Gate put some rules. And he does it very well. For example, a D-Mail is used to alter the past, and it will have the following effect: changed the actual worldline. Okabe have the reading Steiner, so when we switch between two worldline, he remember all the things about the old worldline.
To cancel the effect of a D-Mail, and so return to the initial worldline, they have to send another D-Mail, to the same person, and tell something opposite at the first D-Mail.
Okay so here's the plot hole. At the episode 22, they have to cancel the last D-Mail, which is in reality the first one: ""Makise Kurisu has been stamped"". They do that by using the IBN 5100, hacking the CERN, find this message, and... Delete it by pressing enter! Here we are. How the action of deleting the D-Mail in the present can have effect on the past? It can't, if we follow the rules of the anime. I can agree that it change the future, but it means that Makise Kurisu should be dead, and the worldline shouldn't change. The fact that we see the animation that indicates a switch of worldline isn't logic, and it's for me an inconsistence.
All others inconsistencies can be resolved in the way that it's an anime, and there's some things that we just have to admit. For example, I read on the net the following thing: when Okabe send the first D-Mail to Daru, we can‚Äôt know if the door of the microwave is open, that is necessary to get the effect of the D-Mail. Honestly‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even care. We don‚Äôt see it, so I trust that Daru do some experiences on the microwave, and leave the door open. Who cares? 
But this one can't be resolved in an easy way as this. They put rules and not respect it.
Anyway, that's why I put 8 to this anime, because it's the only thing that I was disappointed.
Characters: 10/10
From Okabe to Mr. Braun, all the characters are interesting in my mind. We have a great casting in this anime, a mad scientist, the girl who don't know anything about the science, but just follow Okabe (Mayuri), Daru which is more interested about 2D girls than 3D, Kurisu who is the little highbrow, and all the other are well defined, Suzuha Amane the ""Part time Warrior"", Moeka, ect...
For example, when Mayuri see Okarin, she always said ""tu tuluuu"", and I found it so funny!
Art: 10/10
Steins gate was published in 2010, and for this date the graphics are really good. And just the global graphics universe is... Wow I don't know how to said, but it fit really well with the theme of the show: a little bit dark when they are in the lab, even the street where the lab is, it's like the lab is a secret place.
Story: 8/10
Here‚Äôs the black point. I think this anime is the anime the most constructed that I see. You can check all the dates when Okabe change worldline, it's coherent. You can't say that the story is bad. You maybe be able to not appreciate it, but don't tell me that it's a bad story.
I don't put 10 because of this inconsistence that I underline higher in this review. And I think Steins Gate excels in the story because it's a really really big anime, with high budget. Every people have high expectations when they start to watch this anime. And there's only one inconsistence, and maybe, I search everywhere an explanation of this inconsistence but I didn't found one, but maybe there is one explanation.
The more you make something with high budget, and well wait by people, the more the public will be exigent. And Steins gate satisfy a lot of people, so they did well I think.
Sound: 10/10
I'm not really an expert about the sound in anime, so I just put 10 because I like the show. But I never heard a bad music when I watch it. The openings and the endings are also very good for me, so I have no reason to critic it.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Even if I found a black point in the story, I really appreciate to watch this anime. It's one of the shows I enjoy the most. Everything is well constructed, and when I start to understand what's going on, you just want to know more things about it. There is a funny part in the anime, which is really really good because it give to the show a bit of humour.
If I have one advice: watch it. You HAVE TO watch it.",8
"
                Steins Gate is one of the most famous Anime of all time, especially on this website, and during the last twenty years or so that have passed, many works that do not deserve any fame or recognition have unfortunately garnered a lot of fans, and we saw a lot of these works get sanctified and venerated by others, whereas in actuality, these Anime do not deserve five minutes of your time. So, is the original Steins Gate Anime one of those Anime, or is it something that is worth your time and investment? 
The story revolves around a young guy of nineteen years of age
                  who is called Okabe, and he dreams of inventing a machine which controls time, and for that he sets up a laboratory in a modest apartment, then he commences in his projects with two friends of his. The first of his friends is a girl that has no relation to his experiments, but she is only there on the count of her being a really close friend to him, and she is called Mayuri. The second friend is an Otaku guy who is of the same age as the main character, he is called Daru, and he is the one who does all of the technical work in the laboratory. This small team is then joined by other people, the most important of them being a genius girl who is called Makise Kurisu, so that she can help the main character in accomplishing his goals. This is the main body structure of the story which is unaffected by the time changes. There is also a body structure on top of it that is changing throughout the course of the Anime‚Äôs run. Each set of episodes is changed to serve the course of the story, and this means that the overall story structure is complex and not simple, but not to a negative degree. I find that the structure of the story is distinctive and adds an effective touch to support the element of time travel in the story. We will go through a period of research and preparation that will last about five episodes in the first timeline, then through the second period, the second timeline which is crowned by the Dmail technique, where the characters send messages to the past, in an alerting manner so that they could change some events which occurred in the present, and that changes the current present into a different version with different circumstances. These changes turned some of the events in the present into beautiful for some people, but in turn it caused a tragedy to other people. This drives us to our third period, the third timeline which centers around Kurisu‚Äôs device ‚Äì leap machine ‚Äì and it works on sending the present tape to the past in a limited manner, and here the hero tries to fix what he ruined during the second period. Then we move to the fourth and last period, and we return back to the first timeline by using a time machine from the future, which was constructed by Daru. Here the protagonist seeks, after learning his lesson from his previous failures, to fix things from their roots by not tampering with what happened during the past directly. The story ends after the hero succeeds in saving everyone. This is the body structure of the story in a more detailed manner, and it is divided in a lively, fun and convenient way to follow, because the story depends on the machines and the gadgets that are used, and that is a lively thing to have in a narrative, because the events can be shaped according to the capabilities of each gadget. 
Add in to the fact that the writer added something very imaginative to support the story, and that is the fact that everybody forgets any new time change, so they live in the new present without knowing that it indeed has changed, with the exception of the titular protagonist, and this is what makes the time travel aspect of the story tight. An issue is that the writer did not explain why the main protagonist has this memory ability in the first place, but he made the story more exciting by making Kurisu remember what had happened through her dreams. 
The characters in Steins Gate are standard, none of them have any noticeable flaws within them, nor do they have any qualities about them that would make them three dimensional, but some of them do have qualities which manage to bring them closer to excellence, and this is noticeable especially in the two characters Okabe and Daru. As for the rest of the cast, there really isn‚Äôt anything special about them. The general atmosphere between the cast gives off a theme of a harem, which occurs when one person of a certain gender is given love and care by many people from the opposite gender. The undertones of a harem in this story are not suitable at all for it, because who is this scientist who gathers random girls around him? And who are these girls who are interested in someone who is as weird as the titular character? This all weakens the believability in the relationship between the characters, and to add more insult to injury, there really isn‚Äôt any comedic paradox to help ease this issue. What weakens the seriousness of the story more is the fact that all of the characters are young people of age, which really borders on illogical in a story that is trying to make time travel seem as realistic as possible. The protagonist and his mates are otakus, and not real scientists, and this is a weakness again in the believability of the characters with accordance to what they do. 
The dialogue between the characters is divided into two parts: Technical dialogue which revolves around everything having to do with time travel, and general social dialogue between the characters which improves their relationship with one another. The technical dialogue is fairly good throughout the show, but the latter dialogue is standard and tends to weaken during it‚Äôs emotional parts at times, and tends to be strong at some other parts, especially during the last quarter of the Anime. 
All of the arcs in Steins Gate suffer from an issue relating to realism. There is no interaction between the characters of the story with people on the streets or shops in a way that supports realism or gives the story life. To make matters even worse, all of the characters who have a relation to the time travel aspect of the story surprisingly know each other, to the point where even the shop owner downstairs was revealed to be the FB. Moreover, all of the characters are na√Øve and kind in an unrealistic manner, to the point where one of the characters sacrifices her father so that her colleague would not die. This is very unrealistic, especially according to that certain character, who is supposed to be a bit selfish and arrogant, but the writer at the end of the day is stubborn to the point where they write all of them as kind and naive, in a stereotypical and unrealistic fashion. 
Now let us take a look at the four timelines and periods which take place in terms of quality of the events and it‚Äôs developments. We have the period of research and investigations, and it contains the character introductions, and the general goal and atmosphere of the story. It is also the period of experimentations when it comes to innovating and understanding how the first time machine works. This period of time also contains the beginning of the Anime of course, which is one of the worst beginnings for any story, period. The beginning moves through the events in an unstructured manner, and without even finishing the contents of each event. The events themselves do not support the general goal of the story, and do not succeed in identifying the characteristics of the main character in a correct manner. An example of this is him seeing the death of Makise Kurisu - who has no relation to any of the characters at this point of the story - he doesn‚Äôt even begin to question the matter, and this means that the beginning of the story is an inverse start, and there has yet to be an inverse start this bad.  What makes matter even worse is the fact that the comedy is implemented very early on in the story, and how would the writer expect the director to take a time travel story seriously if he was implementing jokes from the very start? With this, the beginning solidifies it‚Äôs status as both bad and rushed, and is one of the worst inverse starts of any time travel story. The events which take place during this part of the story move in a slow pace, and without any hooks or any cliffhangers at the end of the episodes, and this makes it hard for someone to sit through it and for some to drop it upon first viewing. 
The second period in the story is better than the introduction when it comes to storytelling, and the events start to become better when the characters start using the Dmail technique, and this means that the story actually commences at this stage. The time related events are generally good, and it is fun to watch the changes that will be created because of them - even when some of them are unbelievably unrealistic - such as the boy Ruka transforming into a girl if his mother changes her eating habits. The social events are good as well during this stage of the story, and the comedic touch from the hero of the story is nice and fun, as well as that of his colleague Daru, which suits his slightly perverted personality. As for the rest of the cast, they really aren‚Äôt that developed, as most of them resemble most other Anime characters, but not to the same annoyingly quirky extent. 
We then arrive to the third period, which contains many positives and many negatives. The events start to get even more interesting after the changes the team of Okabe make, where even one of the characters gets killed off, and finally we enter events that are sharp and substantial to the story, but unfortunately are transformed into repetitive and stretched out events. For example, the writer takes a lot of time in showing the idea that there is no use in travelling in the near future to change the events of the story, and that Mayuri will eventually die despite all of their efforts. This subject matter took up a bunch of episodes, either to stretch out the content and for financial gain reasons, or because the writer does not know how to show this idea without using up too many episodes. This turns the idea into less beautiful due to the stretching that takes place, and it could have been executed in a much better fashion. Okabe‚Äôs relationship with Kurisu becomes more crystal clear during this arc of the story, and the romance is fairly well done. 
The Anime contains some action scenes, the first and foremost of them being the event where first death of Mayuri took place. Here the action turns very weak and very becomes hard to take seriously, as Suzuha beats up armed men in a matter of seconds, yet none of them think of pulling the trigger and shooting her and Kiryu waits for her to finish beating them off so that she could aim her gun at her. Again, very unrealistic for an Anime that is trying to achieve realism in a fictional story. 
We finally arrive at the fourth and last arc of the story, where the Anime reaches it‚Äôs peak when it comes to the time travel aspect, and the mad scientist Okabe becomes more capable in controlling the time travel aspect of the story. Excitement is positively increased, and the characters manage to identify the main danger when returning to the first timeline. During it Kurisu dies, and we move on to a time machine that is more advanced, and the main character begins to try out ways to stop the catastrophe from taking place. The obstacles which he faces are fairly entertaining and believable, and it is fun to see how he reacts to those dire circumstances, and this means that Steins Gate truly starts to get better from the very weak beginning, until we arrive to the fourth and final arc which is actually good. This arc contains the ending, which is very good, and an amazing conclusion to Okabe and Kurisu‚Äôs relationship. There is a colossal difference in quality when comparing the frail beginning of Steins Gate to it‚Äôs strong ending. 
The character designs are suitable for this kind of story, the hero being the least striking when it comes to his design. Generally speaking, the character designs of the characters resemble the characters‚Äô actions and personalities, the best thing about them being the clothes that they wear, as all the clothes fairly support their traits. As for the movements, it is fairly good. The camera angles were chosen correctly, except for a couple of fanservice shots which weren‚Äôt really necessary to the story, especially something that is trying to differentiate itself from other Anime. 
The English dub is very well made, and the voices are suitable for the characters, and the quality of the actors is good. As for the Japanese dub, it is excellent, especially the voice actors for Okabe and Mayuri, and the voice actor for Okabe managed to bring and add a comedic touch to his character, which wasn‚Äôt to be found in the main script. The soundtrack is fairly good, but nothing spectacular, as the tracks stand out the most during a couple of moments in the show, such as the end of episode nine when Okabe finds out about Okihabara street not having any Anime or games anymore. 
Overall, Steins Gate was a fine Anime. What detracted from it becoming excellent was the weak first arc, which had a very frail and vacuous start, ignoring the fact that the show had many stretched out and repeated events, which could have been cut out from the Anime. If this Anime were cut down to a twelve episode run, then it would have made for a much better experience overall, and if the producers had changed the weak beginning of the story to a beginning as strong as it‚Äôs ending, then this show would have achieved excellence.",6

                Upon writing this review, I believe the series has delivered pretty well and is likely to change in a good way.
I had looked forward to this story simply because of the plot summary. Time travel was always mysterious and unproven so it allows the writers to roll with some imagination while at the same time adding logic and even modern events to the equation. Seeing a female and male lead I always hope for some sexual tension between the protagonists. I haven't played the visual novel and do not appreciate spoilers without warning so hopefully I can write this without giving away too much.
Story -
                  9
So far the plot has been very captivating with touches of light moments. There is a good balance to keep the viewer entertained. The beginning I seemed a little slow and therefore may lose some viewers because there is more focus on the characters themselves, but the plot picks up shortly after. 
Art - 8
The characters weren't detailed as much as I would have liked but some of the scenery and imagery made up for it. I will say though, I did like the emotions conveyed in the characters' faces. Since the series contains time travel you can guess where the animators had to put the bulk of their efforts.
Sound - 8
I love the OP. I find myself listening to the opening credits.  It matches the series visually and as you continue to watch the series unfold you'll find that it fits the mood as well. I didn't really notice the background music too much but it didn't distract from the story. ED is okay for now but it didn't strike anything special for me. Just my opinion. Who knows, it might grow on me later. 
Character voices: I hear they are the same as the Visual Novel (Did not play game) so it's not like people should complain about so-and-so's voice being better. It was nice to hear Asami Imai again. I thought Mamoru's voice was perfect for his character. 
Character - 9
I would have given this a 10 since there is very good character development and interaction. Introducing them in the beginning the way they did allowed me to invest in each character differently but some characters could have been given more background; others, less. Being 24 eps this season, I'm satisfied so long as the show continues to further unfold the characters. 
Mamoru Miyano's voice is highly recognizable. His character....grew on me as the series went on and continues to grow. 
Enjoyment -10
Maybe some might not like the fact that things aren't spelled out for them but I like this series for that reason.  So far I'm loving this series especially because it is both thought-provoking and entertaining. I think it's doing a good job putting us the audience, in the main character's shoes.  I love the discussions and each episode has left me wanting more. I hope this anticipation continues until the very end.
Overall - 9
For a series that isn't finished yet I'm giving a fairly high rating. Based on where it is now, I'm anticipating for the series to pick up even more so from this point on. 
Tuturu~!

                Before I begin, I should make it clear that this review is not meant to promote an anime to those who haven't seen it, but rather, it is meant to evaluate a great title. Thus, be warned that there will be significant spoilers in this review, so do not read if you haven't already completed the show. With that out of the way, let's get started.
Who doesn't love the concept of time travel? Many scientists have been fascinated by the idea, yet there hasn't been any real progress on this field in today's world. Not only is our technology still lacking from accomplishing this feat,
                  but ethical consequences also remind some of us why time travel may not be ""ideal"". Putting this in perspective, think about what would happen if you were suddenly transferred into a future twenty years from now. You may meet your future child or grandchild and you wouldn't even know it. However, by meeting them in this way, you're also changing history itself, and that could have some serious implications on the present world you live in. Steins;Gate explores the interesting concept of time travel by taking the form of a psychological thriller. 
Story -- 9/10
Basically, we have a group of college students who have discovered a way to send text messages to the past, and in doing so, they can alter the world. This ties back to what I talked about earlier -- should time travel really be attempted? Well, the group experienced first-hand just how incredibly wrong things went after they tempered with time. For each message they sent back to the past, the world around them has slowly, but gradually, changed. All of this eventually led to a secret organization named SERN, catching on to the group's experiments, and brutally murdering one of the members. From there on, the story took a serious turn, shifting genre from a normal Sci-fi/Slice of Life to a Thriller. The protagonist of the story is ultimately caught in a dilemma, between saving the life of his childhood friend (who was killed by an agent of SERN) and saving his new love interest from dying. For the majority of the second half, the protagonist travels back in time repeatedly in attempt to save his friend from dying. It is also in this second half that we can clearly feel the protagonist's pain and suffering, since he is the only character who retains any memory after travelling from one world line to the next. The plot has successfully constructed a ""believable"" thriller without too many inconsistencies, and it is subjectively very entertaining all the way. 
Character -- 10/10
In my opinion, almost all characters in Steins;Gate are either well developed or just plainly likable. In fact, Steins;Gate wouldn`t be half the show it is without these characters. The group of college students I was talking about earlier get together in a shop keeper's basement, which sort of serves as their secret lab. Here's a quick run down of the lab members.
Okabe Rintarou- He is the protagonist of the story and the founder of the lab (which really isn't what you would call a lab... but I digress). Love him or hate him, you will definitely remember the guy. He introduces himself as a mad scientist and calls himself Hououin Kyouma (he actually prefers others to address him as Hououin or Kyouma, rather than his real name). From talking to himself on his own cellphone to giving other characters strange nicknames, you will probably think he's an idiot. Personally, I think he's part of the reason why this show works well; since the overall tone in Steins;Gate is dark, his character manages to provide enough comic relief to balance the mood. In a nutshell, this man is usually a goofball, and only becomes serious when it counts.
Makise Kurisu- She is the main heroine of the story and the ""assistant"" to Okabe. She often serves as the voice of reason to Okabe's whimsical decisions. Her interactions with Okabe are arguably some of the most enjoyable moments in Steins;Gate. On the surface, they would constantly bicker, but it's clear from the start that they have strong chemistry together. And as one would expect, she becomes the main love interest for Okabe. Thanks to Okabe, she has at least 8 unique nicknames -- the most common one being Christina. She can be best described as calm and intelligent. Also, she's one of the few tsundere characters I actually love with a passion.
Shina Mayuri- The other central heroine of the story. In a sense, her role in the story is just as significant as Kurisu's, since the actual thriller part of the story doesn't begin until she has been killed. She is the childhood friend of Okabe, and has an unusually cheerful demeanor. She often refers to Okabe as Okarin, and calls herself Mayushii.
Hashida Itaru- Usually referred to as Daru, he is the super haker, er, hacker, in the group, who does most of the technical works (e.g., hacking into SERN's system and learning about their secrets). When he's not busy hacking, he is a perverted otaku who likes to make dirty jokes in the presence of girls.
Akiha Rumiho- Normally addressed as Ferris, she works as a maid and has a habit of ending all her sentences with ""nyan"". Essentially moe personified. 
Amane Suzuha- From the beginning we can easily see that she knows a great deal about time travel. It is later confirmed she is John Titor, the enigmatic time traveller who told Okabe to save the world. She feels insecure when around people, probably due to the fact that she lives in a dystopian future governed by SERN.
Kiryuu Moeka- A girl who is pretty much mute, constantly relying on text messages as her primary method of communication. In reality, she works as a spy for SERN. 
Urushibara Ruka- An extremely effeminate boy who deeply respects Okabe. He wishes he was born as a girl instead, because other guys often made fun of his looks. 
In short, all these characters have their own quirks and serve their purpose well in the story. Definitely one of Steins;Gate's strongest points.
Art -- 8/10
Animated by the relatively new Studio, White Fox (the producer of another great work, Katanagatari), the animation style is pleasing to the eyes for the most part. It isn't comparable to high budget productions of Kyoto Animation, P.A. Works, and Ufotable by any means, but it does serve its purpose for a thriller. The animation is pretty consistent for characters and backgrounds, with backgrounds being more pronounced. Character designs are sufficient enough for the average viewer to stay interested. Last but not least, I should mention that the visuals in Steins;Gate have somber colours, which work well in reminding the viewer that this is a Mystery/Thriller title with an underlying dark tone. 
Sound -- 8/10
The Opening song, along with two other insert songs, are done by Kanako Itou, who, in my opinion, is a talented artist. The songs are pretty catchy and memorable. The original soundtracks are not especially awesome, but they do contain some great pieces, such as ""Gate of Steiner"", ""Christina"", and ""Farewell"". However, I can say that most of the soundtracks fit the animated scenes well, and effectively, accentuating the mood of those scenes. Moreover, the voice actors did a great job on voicing their respective characters. Miyano Mamoru, well known for his role as Yagami Raito in Death Note, did another fantastic job in his role as Okabe; his mad scientist laughs are spot on and effectively captures Okabe's [playful] insanity. Hanazawa Kana and Seki Tomokazu voiced Mayuri and Daru, respectively; both are experienced voice actor/actress's who excel at bringing out the best emotions in their characters. I have to say I have never heard of Imai Asami before her role as Kurisu, seeing how she isn't exactly a seasoned voice actress. But after her performance as Kurisu, I really think she ought to have more roles in the future, for she has successfully displayed emotions on a level I think only a veteran could have accomplished. Special mention goes to Tamura Yukari, who did a nice job on Suzuha's part. The voice acting is overall consistent and great. 
Enjoyment -- 10/10
At this point, you should already know I absolutely enjoyed this show. There aren't many anime out there that have impressed me as much as Steins;Gate did. The first half of the series did well to introduce the characters through witty conversations and dialogues. It's light hearted and comedic at the beginning, then it gradually gets darker as the story approaches its climax. The transition from the light hearted, comedic first half to the more serious, dramatic second half feels smooth and natural. That isn't to say this show has no flaws, because every anime has a flaw in it somewhere. In the case of Steins;Gate, it left a few questions unanswered, along with some very minor issues with the first half's pacing. But that doesn't make it any less enjoyable for me. 
Objective Score -- 9/10
Looking at it from an entirely objective standpoint, the imperfect story prevents the series from being a total masterpiece. However, the show's strong characterization, as well as its brilliant plot, more than compensates for the few flaws it possesses. 
Subjective Score -- 10/10
If you only look at the overall enjoyability and overlook the minor issues, then it's a freaking perfect anime. If you're a fanboy, then this will probably be a 11/10 for you. 
Final verdict? Steins;Gate is a gem among anime. A must-see for any anime fan, especially for those interested in time travel. It is a title to be remembered for many years to come.

Initiating Operation Ragnarok - putting Stein's Gate into perspective.
2011 AD: Stein's Gate (SG) had a huge fan base
2012 AD: The popularity of SG has not faded. We see the epilogue (that in itself does not contain much substance receiving extraordinary scores) getting very much undue popularity.
2014 AD: The hype dies down. The fanboys (and girls) from the FateZero campaign take over. Some die hard SG fans convert. SG is no longer #3 on MAL.
I had BIG expectations prior to viewing Stein's Gate. This was especially since it was able to top other strong contenders in 2011 such as Puella Magi and AnoHana. I was
                  told that it was ""well executed with a touching and deep plot that tackled upon darker themes"". However, after completing the SG I couldn't help feeling disappointed. 
Stein's Gate works with concepts of time travel and uses it as a foundation for its narrative. It's refreshing that they're including real life references such as the LHC and other theories to back themselves up but ultimately the explanations and techno jargon used to verify the plausibility of time travel did not prove convincing.
SG‚Äôs synopsis about a group of friends avoiding SERN is misleading. While this does occur, it is not the focus of the series.  In fact, SERN remains a mysterious organization after SG concludes. Stein‚Äôs Gate is more about attempting to return to one‚Äôs initial world line. The series has a slow start but does pick up its pace later on. By slow start, I mean the first 10 episodes were mundane with a few comedic moments that were not that funny. The plot thickens at the end of episode 11. At this point I thought to myself ‚Äúokay now it gets serious, way to pick up the pace‚Äù. It was entertaining for a while‚Ä¶ but then came episode 14, and my expectations of SG were shattered. In general, the arcs following this subscribe to a similar format: The problem, problem solving and finally resolution and reflection. It doesn‚Äôt seem as if SG is ready to challenge itself and present its rather well thought out story in a different manners. While some argue that the use of arcs was ingenious, I think otherwise. Despite the direct relationship between individual arcs and story events, these arcs feel disjointed from one another and the series did not flow as well as it could have. Another problem was that each arc did not receive sufficient screen time. Often, the resolution/reflection part of things seemed rushed. In all honesty, these parts should have been given extra care especially when they dealt with the more delicate themes. 
Throughout SG, there were also ‚Äòunnecessary‚Äô inserts. Special mention goes to the intro scene in episode 12. This serene scene is sometime referred to again in the show. But what does it mean? What is its significance? Is it a figment of Okabe‚Äôs imagination or an actual event that he remembers subconsciously like how other lab members recall events of different world lines? These questions like many others in the series remain very unexplained. The dialogue makes no sense in this scene. Original Okarin? Original Mayuri? If time could be traversed in both directions, the past, present and future should be undefined. As a result, how can one say that one, from a certain time period (presumably from the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù time period which should not exist), is more authentic than any of the others? Moving on, what was the point of showing Okabe‚Äôs ‚Äòtimeshift-like fever‚Äô when he was young? It didn‚Äôt tie any loose ends. It contributed to the poor time management of the series. But hey, it was nice to know anyways! 
The twists in SG were not as great as people made them out to be.  Admittedly, some twists were unexpected like the one involving Suzu and Daru or Moeka and FB, but like much of the show they were not given much significance. You shouldn‚Äôt give 5 minutes to explain the aftermath of a twist. It undermines any cleverness behind the twist.  As a result, they seemed like afterthoughts. Other twists regarding the cause of Kurisu‚Äôs death were obvious a long time before the second last episode. This brings us to that fated scene that filled me with many questions; how does failing to rescue Kurisu allow Okabe to see the video from his future self? This is especially since he did not cause any changes to that past, how could the present have changed?  Also why doesn‚Äôt Suzu help him at all? Why does Kurisu‚Äôs Dad flee from a half dead person pointing a knife at him? How does Okabe with 170+ IQ make such a mistake that forces him to improvise at the heat of the moment when he had all the time to prepare? How does Okabe, with that amount of blood loss, stay conscious? And finally, why does reaching Stein‚Äôs Gate cause everything to conveniently fall in place? That, my friend, is bullshit. If someone can fill me in as to why the SG‚Äôs story deserves anything more than a 7/10, I would appreciate it.
There are other issues with the story, but for length‚Äôs sake I will stop here.
The art in SG is clean and the animation fluid. Upon first glance, character art seems a bit awkward to look at. But after a while it does grow on you. Character designs were okay. The wardrobe was fine but the faces of some female characters were close to identical. If you swapped the hairstyle and hair colour between Ruka and Feyris, or between Mayuri and Kuruse they could pass off as one another. On the other hand, the backgrounds were very very very well drawn.
Despite the OP and ED songs not being catchy by themselves, they do fit the show very well. Voice actor/actresses also did a fine job in giving life to the characters. Track insert choices and sequencing throughout the show did not overpower or undermine key scenes; instead they improved the atmosphere. In terms of sound, SG excels.
As for the characters (note I didn‚Äôt include some supporting characters because their role in the show was minimal):
‚Ä¢	Okabe: Great lead. Definitely fascinating and different from many others who fall into specific stereotypes. He undergoes good character development, which was one of the things that kept me from dropping the series altogether.
‚Ä¢	Mayuri: Tuturu? She‚Äôs a burden. It‚Äôs not her fault. She seems to be an ‚Äòairhead‚Äô but she isn‚Äôt really‚Ä¶ just a boring girl.
‚Ä¢	Kurisu: Tsundere for the sake of being tsundere
‚Ä¢	Daru: Perverted and otaku-like dude. He‚Äôs a decent guy when he‚Äôs serious but that doesn‚Äôt occur very much.
‚Ä¢	Feyris: The try to be cute character nyan.
‚Ä¢	Suzu: The active character who was unlike some others quite real in her reactions. 
‚Ä¢	Moeka: The quiet character. Everyone should hate her. Everyone will hate her.
‚Ä¢	Ruka: lolwut? No comment here.
‚Ä¢	Mr Brown: Caring father and the landlord for the lab. He has a nice backstory. Wish they elaborated. Might have made him a better character.
I think what we see here is a recipe for a harem. At times, the show does feel like a harem, especially since many characters seem to be attracted to Okabe for one reason or the other. Owing to the little bit of harem in it, the drama in character arcs felt wrong. 
One of the biggest issues I had with the characters was their selflessness. It‚Äôs quite hard to believe that a normal person would surrender their dreams so readily (in a matter of days) to a claim that cannot be factually verified (Mayuri‚Äôs death). Is their trust in Okabe, who calls himself a mad scientist and is known for making up stuff, so strong? Any sane person would do away with such claims. But hang on, these parts show ‚Äútrue‚Äù friendship someone says, and man tears need be shed. No correction, if anything this illustrates that these characters are na√Øve selfless freaks. Another issue I had was how the characters strangely faded away after their respective arcs and seem to have been forgotten when they could be ‚Äòselflessly‚Äô helping.
Overall, SG really wasn‚Äôt bad but it most definitely wasn‚Äôt great either. ‚ÄúDeceive yourself, deceive the world‚Äù. You can make believe that SG is a masterpiece well deserving of a 10/10. With sufficient effort you might even succeeded in making it the rage of 2011. However, understand that even if you found the series magnificent it should be reviewed free from personal bias and according to its actual worth. That is a combination of its literature value, its ability to induce emotions, visuals, sounds etc. Stein‚Äôs Gate does decently when you assess it according to the criteria above, but it certainly receives no nobel prizes in any one department. Consequently, the series always felt like it was missing something.

                I find it incredibly weird that among all the people that suggested me this anime and/or talked about it positively on the internet, there was no one who even mentioned that at its basis Steins Gate is... well, a Harem anime.
Now, I say it's an Harem anime yet you don't see a towering two as my overall rating for it. ""How come?"" You'll ask, ""Isn't this an anime where all female characters exist only to be attracted to the protagonist? And don't all of those characters lack in any kind of agency?""
Well... yes... to both questions... but... hear me out...
Steins Gate is pretty much a
                  mix of comedy and sci-fi thriller, in which a delusional ""scientist"" (or in his words: MADD SCIENTISTU) creates by accident a machine capable of sending texts backwards through time. Learning how to use the machine and the subsequent hi-jinx will lead him to meet a vast of array of trope-y girls (the sweet one, the tsundere, the quiet one, etc.)... and yes, all of them are attracted to him for no reason whatsoever.
The series though, despite following a lot of the harem tropes, seems to at least try to give these girl a wider scope in the thriller-y part of the plot, rather than just using them as waifu fodder. This is at least appreciable, despite the results being far from perfect (near the end the protagonist literally has to make each of the girls fall in love so hard that it puts time back together... lovely).
To be honest what annoys me most about the Harem-like characterization of the cast is that it actively hinders the emotional core of the story. The four ""main"" characters are in fact quite likable and interact with each other in a very enjoyable way... but then we have to be reminded that one of those characters MUST be a tsundere and everything falls down as the characterization steers towards the trope-y and nonsensical for a couple of minutes. Even worse, any other character they interact with ends up as seriously under-characterized and pretty much reduced to their one liner quirky concept (apart for maybe one of them, and even then it doesn't really turns around until the end).
This is obviously a huge problem as the whole first half of the series is pretty much dedicated to exploring the relationship between the characters. As the episodes go by though, the thriller elements will slowly come in, as the characters realize that changing the past can have enormous and unexpected consequences on the future. 
By the 13th episode the series will have pretty much lost any comedic element, leaving us with a bunch of quite enjoyable pulpy-time-travel-schlock. This transition is handled quite well, as by then we will have enough connection with the main characters to actually care about their fate and be engaged in what happens to them as the world around tries to break them. Obviously this later half also has annoyances derived from the harem structure and a couple of stupid plot points, but overall it does its job competently enough.
Mind that I'm not talking about anything particularly mind-blowing or ground-breaking, but I personally am quite happy that it does not try to be so. The plot is laid up in a pretty linear way, it's easy to follow and it mixes well various approach to time-travel to create a story that manages to solve most of its mysteries in pretty straight forward and non-convoluted ways. To be honest, knowing how anime tends to be, I was expecting exactly the opposite, instead I've been pleasantly surprised by Stains Gate's down to earth approach to time travel.
So, yes, Steins Gates did at least manage to make me slightly engaged in the fate of its main characters, at the same time though it made me groan in disapproval and roll my eyes way more than it should be allowed by law. Not unwatchable by any means, in fact there is an ok pulpy sci-fi story hidden in there, but one does have to be able to endure quite a bit of shallow characters and visual novel tropes to actually enjoy it.",5

                Ah~ Okarin! Tuturu! 
Okay, first time I'm writing a review, even though this series is far from over.
As of writing this, I just finished the sixth episode.
Story: 10
Outstanding, this story is just awesome! Set in modern days, but also concerning time-travelling, something that might never be possible (as it would probably create a lot of paradoxes), explained in a very good way.
Art: 9
Not perfect, but certainly very good. It really suits the series well.Sound: 8
The opening theme is catchy, but there're not a lot of other sounds to be found...
Character: 10
Rintarou; the world's hippest 'mad scientist' is very well portrayed throughout the episodes that I've watched thus far, not really the 'stereotype' I was expecting, which is good!
Mayuri; THIS. IS. IT. She's almost the exact opposite of Okarin, though they're very close friends. An airhead, but very cute... stuff... you know... She's awesome.
Kurisu(tina); she's the smartest one, a real 'prodigy', if you will. Also very honest.
Itaru; SUPA HACKA, 'nuff said.
Enjoyment: 10
If you are slightly intelligent (if you can open the fridge without having to consult a neighbour), I recommend you to watch this, I'm certainly enjoying it.
Overall: 9
Not everything is perfect, though this is close, in my opinion...",9

                Every time that I go to the ""recent reviews"" section of MAL, there's two things that I'm guaranteed to find. The first is at least one review condemning one of the two seasons of SAO, and the other is at least one review explaining how Steins;Gate is a 10/10 masterpiece that reinvents the meaning of good anime. Funnily enough though, SAO and Steins;Gate have something in common: the reasons that both of them get such an enormous amount of attention is that they either fail or succeed on an extremely superficial level, making SAO a prime target for butchering and Steins;Gate into an object of
                  worship. Look at the MAL categories: Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment. Steins;Gate neatly ticks every one of those boxes and happily takes its place as one of the greatest shows of all time for meeting the criteria for what makes up a ""good show"" on MAL: it has no weak points. SAO takes all the hate because its weak points are obvious: it has poor pacing, poor character focus, obvious plot holes... a washing machine could discern these problems and exploit them. Then along comes Steins;Gate, and it doesn't have these things. It must be good. Now, I'm not here today to disprove this. I noticed a couple of inconsistencies and plot conveniences in Steins;Gate, but nothing that affected my enjoyment of it. The first thing that I look at in a show is not what it doesn't do, it's what it does do. Steins;Gate isn't good because of what it isn't: it's good because of what it is.
So what IS Steins;Gate? To put it simply, it's a well-thought-out cute whacky time-travel story. It's a lot like Doctor Who, actually, but with a little more grounded conflict and intelligent plot design (so like Doctor Who on a good day). If you go in with no expectations you'll be entertained, you'll ooh and ahh, you'll route for the over-the-top characters, and you'll get a nice dose a romance and a disney-esque ending (except more clever). I would have loved to have written a bouncy and satisfied review about how much fun this show was and how other people should get a group together and watch this, but that's not gonna happen. You see, the most important line of that above description was ""if you go in with no expectations"".
At this point, no one is going in without expectations.
This review is for those who haven't already seen the show. I'm writing this not because I don't think you should watch Steins;Gate, but because when you do I want you to not have to go into it with unrealistic expectations. 
This show has had the crap hyped out of it. The MAL community has stuck it in the number 2 spot of all time for scoring, hundreds of thousands of people have favorited it, dozens of 10s reviews are written every day, and people keep on talking about how it ""changed their life"" or is ""the best anime of all time"". We've seen what happens when shows get this kind of popularity: a counter-culture arises intent on proving that this fame is unwarranted, finding the most obvious problems with the show and using this to destroy it. Bleach, Fairy Tail, Naruto, Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online: all have risen to astounding heights and all have been met with vicious opposition pointing out that they're full of fillers, or have shallow and cliche characters, or are melodramatic, or are repetitive. Well, Steins;Gate doesn't have these problems. It isn't superficially ""bad"", it's not entirely unoriginal, and it doesn't take itself very seriously which gives it a huge defense against anyone being nit-picky. There's no flaw you can hone in on. Sure, you can chip away at the edges, but that's not enough to justify writing a scathing review. It also feels like a pretty cool show, which makes people even reluctant to attack it for its tone or for being too sappy. What happens as a result is that we're left with no one espousing anything but praise for Steins;Gate despite the fact that, well...
Well, we'll get back to that. Time to for the review portion.
ART & SOUND
Not particularly relevant. The art is pretty standard aside from the color palette, which consists of a lot of greys, whites and blacks. This felt appropriate for a scientific show and was a nice reflection of how the characters felt about their lives. The opening and ending were both pretty solid, but nothing otherworldly. The OST left absolutely no impression on me, which I suppose means that it at least wasn't jarring.
EVERYTHING ELSE
Breaking up the elements of a story is a terrible way to review it. The story is going to succeed based on how well these elements work together, not how ""good"" they are on their own. 
Steins;Gate is a time-travel story. While I wouldn't call it ""groundbreaking"", it definitely manages to use the elements of the genre in a way that is fresh and endearing. Steins;Gate uses most of classic elements of time-travel: time paradoxes, various timelines, the relationship between the past, present and future, but it does a really good job of establishing what the rules and limitations of time travel are and how it functions, and then sticking to them. Because it strictly abides by the rules of its own universe, it makes plot revelations related to time-travel very satisfying because you realize that you probably could have figured them out beforehand it you'd put your mind to it. The device used to time-travel in Steins;Gate is a toaster oven (the use of an absurd mundane object makes me think of Doctor Who once again) and it uses just the right about of obvious not-meant-to-be-taken-seriously pseudoscience to make this work. It was also refreshing to find that right off the bat the characters in Steins;Gate weren't trying to invent time travel because there was something they wanted to do or change with it, but instead simply because time travel is really f*cking cool and they wanted to see if they could do it. In addition, instead of just having one mad scientist Steins;Gate understands that science is not usually something that progresses that drastically at the hands of one person: it takes a team of talented and intelligent people to make progress, and it was the endearing dynamics of the Future Gadget Lab and its array of talented and untalented members that oftentimes made the show so enjoyable.
As the story develops, we start to see Steins;Gate make very clever use of its time-travel elements and begins to build a plot that uses many of the small details from its early episodes to make sense. It proves that it's capable of being dramatic and even occasionally a bit dark, but in the end it always comes back to its ridiculous roots and towards the end it shows that it can use its attention to recursive detail to craft some relatively hysterical scenes as well. The characters, with the exception of the main two, are all pretty standard archetypes who exist mainly to further the plot and add to the humor, but they are well-written and the jokes land more often than not. They don't feel forced, and they don't feel recycled even though the bubbly moe girl and the cute, nice, and generally flawless Nagisa-from-Clannad characters are essentially built on the same foundation as ever (along with others, like the romantically unthreatening best friend). The two main characters are original, well-crafted individuals with real depth and personality. They're also adults, which should not be such a big deal but this is anime so unfortunately it is. Both of them are definitely prime examples for standards of character writing, and they easily carry the show, adding a great deal of charisma and much-needed empathy for when the show decides to be dramatic.
But these are all things that have already been said. Everyone talks about this show all the time, and they use far more exaggerated hyperbole than I just did to sing of the show's many merits. It gets described as the most compelling, amazing, and important story ever written for the reasons I just described. But here's what I see: 
1. Good time travel. Nothing genre-changing, but well-integrated and used smartly = clever
2. Good humor. Doesn't feel the need to draw attention to its jokes, creative with its laughs = funny
3. Good characters. Chemistry is present, well fleshed-out, elicits an emotional connection from the audience = cute
Steins;Gate is clever, funny and cute.
But guys, it doesn't redefine story-telling, it doesn't do anything exceptionally unique, and it really mean anything. At the end of the day, Steins;Gate doesn't do anything that exceptional. It doesn't provide any reasons that it should stand above anything else. Solid execution does not warrant a spot in the hall of fame.
It's a fun show: it's smart, funny, and touching. And if that's why you enjoy it, then that's great. It's good at that. But the expectations this show has at this point far exceed being ""fun"". It's supposed to be the story of the century, a life-changing masterpiece that will forever alter the way you see the world. I, for one, went into it being told that this was the case, both by the MAL community and by a few friends who had already watched it. The result? I was disappointed. What otherwise would've been a show I could have enjoyed exceptionally became a constant source of letdown as time and again it failed to really be anything OTHER than clever, funny and cute. The ending struck me as an all-new level of bad, not because the ending was actually bad, but because I had been led to expect Madoka Magica or even Evangelion and instead I got Disney's Frozen. It amazed me that people who had actually seen something like Evangelion were telling me that THIS was anime's masterpiece. Yeah, Eva has tons of things wrong with it. It's really easy to poke holes in the show's structure. But what it DOES manage to capture in the tumultuous internal suffering of its characters is TIMELESS. Regardless of how old Eva gets, people will be able to look back and find truth, meaning, revelation, and significance in the words of Shinji Ikari, Asuka Langely, Misato and others. For Steins;Gate, that just isn't true. It doesn't try to make you look at the world a new way. At one point, it has a very distinct opportunity to end. If it had, my opinion of it would have been slightly different. It would have somewhat told a story of accepting loss, learning that we can't undo our mistakes or the past, and being able to move forward because we are able to see the importance of what we do have over the sorrow of what we have left behind. However, the show happily threw this away in order to finish tying up all its plot threads and make that picture-esque ending happen. Time-travel fixes everything. Now we're back in Clannad: Afterstory.
Steins;Gate is overhyped. It cannot live up to expectations, which is a pity, because it's a pretty damn good show. What's more of a problem than this, though, is just how much the show is talked about. People discuss this show at an unimaginable frequency. The truth of the matter is, there just really isn't that much to talk about. Once the plot has been reconstructed by a couple of fans, all that's really left is to make fan art. There's no moral discussion, there's no philosophical aspect, there's no new way to look at story-telling or some original element that people can examine: it's just an entertaining journey that's difficult to poke holes in. If you haven't seen it yet, go watch it! You have my full recommendation. But please, don't go into it expecting to have your perception of story-telling forever altered. You'll just end up being disappointed.",8

                I almost feel bad not liking this anime as much as most people do, since everyone seems so passionate about it, but as an avid fan of science-fiction, I have to say this show's treatment of time-travel is a complete mess. There are so many contradictions, so many wild misunderstandings of real life ideas, and so many moments where I felt like saying, ""But hold on a second, why can't you just ...,"" that I eventually gave up keeping track of the faults, and just pretended like the decisions the characters had to make, and the things they did made sense, and let the emotions
                  of the show carry me. Because this is truly where it shines. The chemistry between the characters is excellent and it's a pure joy to be in their midst for the while it lasts. So I wonder if by criticizing the sci-fi for its lack of coherence, I'm in a way not taking Steins;Gate for what it is. This is after all a show where CERN is an evil organization creating black holes with the LHC in order to make all of time a communist utopia, and the transfer of huge amounts of data through text messages can be explained by hacking into the LHC and compressing the data using a black hole, which is as absurdly hilarious as it is mysterious.
Even taking it mainly for its characters though, there are some issues, particularly in pacing. The first episode is very confusing, and it doesn't help that the crazy concepts abruptly being introduced come side-by-side with the main character being himself, who for the first half of the show as a joke keeps insisting to everyone he is a mad scientist and talks about paranoid theories he doesn't actually believe. One is left not even sure what to take seriously as for someone unfamiliar with the show, time-travelling is no more believable than conspiracy theories are. After this confusing first episode it then takes about five more before the plot is even established, the ones before mainly being used to set up the characters, and only in episode 13 does the show actually get properly serious. This structure makes sense when one considers the anime is based on a visual novel, and in a way it's admirable that they are seemingly truthful to it, but it does not make for good pacing for an anime. It's too unbalanced. Other than all that, the darkish visuals, and the music do what they are supposed to do.
Concluding, I would call Steins;Gate a fairly above average time-travelling thriller, but mainly for its amusing characters.",7
"
                Kill me if I do say that this anime was just what I had in mind of -- and so I guess I was hoping for a much better end.
Why an 8? I couldn't make up my mind at what kind of rating I was choosing for such an excellent played out anime. I have watched countless of science-fictional movies and TV documentaries that I think I may be a pro on just what I think is a very complicated plot, turns out to be an easy story line to catch.
I think I've doubted my predictions countless of times with this anime. After hitting off
                  with the 1st episode of Steins;Gate, I nearly dropped the show just because it was a confusing-messed up episode. I stayed with this anime ""on-hold"" for the next few months. After months of abandonment, my friend and everybody else started to say Steins;Gate was probably the most extravagant anime out there and I couldn't help myself but to think at how such an anime with such failure to start well be that great to watch. I gave a closer look at the anime's summary again -- ""Time travel"". That sure brought up everything to me. That word says it out loud and my expectations were laid down at the table and I thought 'I knew it!' Maybe my attachment to the movie, Inception, helped me guide the anime.
Story: 8
A group of guys sending text messages to the past and researching on time travel -- sounds like a typical sci-fi to me. What's amusing is how the anime plays out the scientific explanations but still contains a spec of realism in fate and destiny. Combining both of fate and science together is a very creative act that made the anime more puzzling. My use for some science predictions and some of its main components helped me most of the time to get to know the anime more. Likely an example of this is the Grandfather Paradox that I would always see in Discovery or in some sites. I'm a bit of a hype fan for complicated materials and my curiosity does build up as the story goes deeper. And knowing these kinds of paradox most especially in its importance in space and time helped me get to know this anime easier and without me knowing it I started to have great expectations and predictions for this anime's ending. An anime that made great dramatic outcomes needs a dramatic finish.
Art: 9
What do I say? The messy, blurry, magnifying, shaking animation (most especially in the Opening), made the art and the anime well-connected. There are lots of focused angles in the anime that just feels great for a video editor to edit. No problem with the art. It's plain simple backdrop that looked like the city we live nowadays already says a message. Scientists 'were' making theories and logical explanations on time travelling way beyond the 21st century started. They could have started creating a time machine already. You don't know. it could happen.. Anyway, I think the animation itself screamed 'science-fiction' to me.
Sound: 9
The twitching sounds of the opening, the great band, the great singer's voice -- it was pure heaven. The opening made it clear that this wasn't just your normal anime. The ending song was more calm and I think it was great. After a 24-minute episode of pure suspense and mystery, the anime ends up with a warm music that tops off the episode like a cherry. The ending song was perfect for cliff-hangers -- that's what I think.
Character: 9
To be able to make an anime with this logical plot, a boring character has to be out of the picture. There was never a dull moment in Steins;Gate because the characters will either give you a laugh or let you know a personality you haven't discovered yet. I've known quite a well-rounded set of characters and Okabe Rintarou is one of them. Being an influential man who excels in his league of expertise and at the same time being able to instill a sense of humor, care and responsibility was one of the main reasons this anime was worth watching for.
Enjoyment: 7
My first impression of Steins;Gate during the 1st episode was very messy. And by the time the ending went by I had a ""much"" bigger expectation for such an excellent anime who has been making great cliff-hangers and scenes in every episode. I'm guessing an ending that would have left me hanging at the end of a sci-fi anime could have been a perfect ending for such a perfect plot. I just thought of how very ""predictable"" the ending for this anime was as it concerns more likely on time travel. A very predictable ending -- I mean we all know some Time travelling movies goes back in time because something horrible went wrong. It's a very typical ""time travelling ending"" and I knew it was going to happen. I mean almost all of the Time Travelling movies/shows have the same ending or plot going on. It just didn't bring anything new to the ""time travelling"" plot and especially not anything new to the science fictional types of show. More likely an ending like ""Inception"" that ends with your own intuition on what you think could have happened or a new type of information that could bring a much intelligent surprise. An ending that is more logical than the plot itself. But over-all, the anime was worth for the keeps.
Over-all: 8
Watching a sci-fi anime in my part is kind of a shock since I'm not that easily impressed. Steins;Gate showed me a perfect example of what seem like a logical plot can exhibit dramatic scenes and many turn of events. El Psy Congroo. Yup, I definitely miss that.",8
"
                Time travel is an overwhelmingly, infamously difficult concept to build a work of fiction around, as many stories centered around the idea can't help but eventually succumb to a vicious cycle of increasingly-obvious plot holes. You rarely see a work of this sort that's not only able to logically explain its world, characters and conclusions, but also able to make the viewing of such a winding, complex narrative clear, concise and, most importantly, enjoyable. It's just so easy to either fall into the trap of creating a time paradox or to fill your story with so much scientific exposition that the characters and pacing suffer
                  because of it. However, every once in a while a story is created that somehow manages to strike a wonderful balance between storytelling and scientific logic, therefore producing an intelligent, mind-bending thriller with lovable, exceptional characters to attach to along the complex journey. Despite some minor flaws that hold it back from true excellence, Steins;Gate, studio White Fox's 2011 anime adaptation, is once such occasion.
Our story takes place in modern day Akihabara, Japan, focusing on the life of Okabe Rintarou, or, as he would prefer, self-proclaimed mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, an insanely eccentric 18-year-old college student with a flair for the dramatic. He spends his days alongside his childhood friends, the adorable, innocent Shiina Mayuri and the ever-sarcastic Itaru Hashida (Daru, as he's called), as he works to brainstorm new gadgets and gizmos in hopes of defeating what he refers to as ""the Organization"", a group that may or may not exist and that he believes is always conspiring against him in his various scientific exploits. His main interest, however, has always been the concept of time travel and the adventures of the enigmatic time traveler John Titor, a man who claims to have come from the future but only appears on internet chat forums. This leads him and his friends to meet Makise Kurisu, a 17-year-old prodigy scientist from America who, when giving a lecture at his university, persuasively argues against the concepts of time travel, claiming it to be scientifically impossible. The two argue back-and-forth on the topic for days as they become more acquainted with each other, but all debate gets thrown to the wayside when the unthinkable happens: through the use of a microwave and a cell phone, Okabe and his friends inadvertently discover time travel. Together they work to elaborate on their discoveries while simultaneously attempting to help improve their friends' lives by sending text messages back in time, thereby changing the present for what they assume to be the better.
That's as far as I'm willing to go with a general plot synopsis without giving anything away. If the story seems complex, that's because it is, especially once you add in the other significant supporting characters like the mysterious Moeka Kiryu and, my personal favorite, the energetic Suzuha Amane. However, it's never once unintentionally overwhelming, and that is a testament to one of this show's major strengths: the characters.
You'd be hard pressed to find another cast that feels as real and lovable as this one that didn't come from a show with Bebop in its title. Okabe in particular is one of the most fascinating protagonists you'll witness within the anime medium, beginning the show as a hilarious, clumsy goof and slowly transitioning into a more serious, hardened youth to match the narrative's increasingly dark tone and events. Yet through all the hardship he struggles through, he never loses his charisma, effectively keeping his eccentric personality intact while allowing him to mature. His growth is subtle, complete and matches the show's progression perfectly without sacrificing the initial identity of the character that allows you to grow so attached to him from the very first episode. As far as anime protagonists go, it's tough to name one as unique and likable as him.
That's only the tip of the iceberg, though; Steins;Gate wouldn't be the show that it is without the incredible supporting cast that it creates, nearly all of them experiencing a similarly effective growth to Okabe's. While there are varying degrees of success here, almost everyone goes through a quality coming-of-age arc in some sense, most notably Makise Kurisu. Her role as a foil to Okabe's strangeness is needed early on as she's the one who is able to explain the scientific jargon concisely without losing the attention of the viewer. Not only that, but, as she's the most ""normal"" one among the main cast (and I use that term lightly), a lot of the comedic relief relies on her reactions or responses, and she suits this role perfectly while providing enough wit of her own to add to the humor even further. She could have been a boring, dry character used for nothing but exposition, but instead she shines through as one of the main strengths of the show, almost stealing the spotlight from Okabe when it's all said and done.
Makise and Okabe are the headliners that drive the show for the duration, but that's not to say the others don't serve their roles admirably. Daru is a sarcastic, somewhat-perverted hacker, not exactly an original for the ""best friend"" archetype, but he's consistently quick and witty and plays a role in the plot that makes him more than just comedic relief by the end. Suzuha is an immediately likable and compelling presence whose secrets are extremely satisfying to unravel, becoming arguably the most useful supporting character by the show's end, not to mention the coolest. Moeka may seem off-putting at first, but she plays a huge role in the plot's progression and her backstory is eerily gripping. And Mayuri is, quite simply, the heart of the show who is quintessential for the plot's progression and the motivation of our protagonists. Plus, if you don't think she's one the most adorable characters ever put to animation, I honestly don't know what to tell you.
Unfortunately, not everyone's a winner. Two of the side characters, Ruka Urushibara and Rumiho Akiha (Faris) initially are decent comic relief, providing a temporary break from the dry wit in favor of some more overt moments (one running joke involving Ruka is particularly absurd, and therefore fits perfectly). But when the story starts getting really serious starting in the second half of the show, their inclusion transforms from passable comedy into unforgivable filler that completely halts the story's progression. Unlike the other side characters who get their own arcs and backstories, Ruka and Rumiho's past and present are pretty much irrelevant to the overall story, and while Ruka is likable enough (if a tad pathetic), Rumiho is downright annoying and completely uninteresting. There are two episodes, 17 and 18, that focus solely on Okabe's relationships with these two characters, and it's just so boring to watch. The show was finally getting extremely intense, keeping me on the edge of my seat, but then it abruptly stops for 45 minutes to shed light on characters that don't matter and who I don't care about. Considering how smoothly the show could have escalated towards its impressive finale, I find these two episodes to be entirely unnecessary and personally believe they really damaged the pacing of the show.
While we're on the topic of pacing, that's something that Steins;Gate struggles with throughout its duration, not just in the middle of its second half. The first half of the show works well for growing the characters, explaining the scientific concepts and foreshadowing future events. In fact, after re-watching the series multiple times, I've concluded that this show might just have the best, most subtle foreshadowing that I've ever seen from any story, not just in anime. But as good as the world building and the set up for the second half are, that doesn't change the fact that really nothing much of significant interest occurs within the first 11 episodes outside of the discovery of time travel. Episode 12 hits and changes everything, but that's still asking quite a bit from the viewer, as that's half the show down the drain before the first major plot twist. To clarify, the first half of the show is in no way bad; the characters are goofy fun which sets them up well for more serious progression, the dialogue is consistently hilarious (seriously, this is probably the only anime to ever make me laugh out loud), and the concepts, while very intellectual, remain interesting and easy to keep up with. I just think the show could have gotten to episode 12's bombshell a bit sooner, which, again, calls into question the inclusion of Rumiho and Ruka, as they both take up significant time in the first half of the show as well.
That being said, the plot's brilliance still more than shines through despite the pacing issues. I mentioned at the beginning that it's rare to find a time travel oriented story with no plot holes to speak of, but I certainly couldn't find any here from start to finish. Furthermore, they don't take liberties with the established logic or throw in any random events to achieve this impressive feat. Like I said before, the foreshadowing in the first half of the show is incredible; it's present enough so that guessing the events is plausible, but subtle enough to ensure that almost nobody will, and that's a very, very difficult thing to do and where many other shows have faltered. The excellent dialogue, as well as the aforementioned characters that speak it, accomplishes another daunting task: explaining the scientific reasoning behind the concepts of time travel without bogging down the plot in exposition. I was never bored or overwhelmed, only more invested in the world and concepts that the characters were exploring. Furthermore, adding another layer of depth to the plot, the theories at play here actually exist in the real world. Seriously, you could go Google anything found in the story and you'd be reading about it for days. Taking those heavy concepts and condensing them down so that the average viewer can simply comprehend them is hard enough, but working it into an excellent narrative seems almost impossible. The fact that Steins;Gate pulled this off so elegantly is a testament to the excellent writing. Oh yeah, and on top of all of that intelligence, the show is absolutely hilarious, which strikes a perfect initial tone between serious and comedic, evolving naturally along with the events and characters.
In terms of production value, the show really isn't anything special, but it also doesn't really need to be. Despite including strikingly original art for the character designs, everything else is muddled in less exciting, if more realistic grays and browns. This would be much more of a problem if this were an action show or if it needed to display flashy animation, but the story and characters don't lend themselves to that. There are occasional moments where something more happens on screen, such as the flashing of a timer or the electricity emitted from the microwave, which sort of make you wish they had put more effort into the character animations themselves in order to further envelope you in this world. But as it stands, the animation is passable, doing its job and occasionally a bit more.
The same can't really be said for the soundtrack, although you really can't say much about the soundtrack whatsoever seeing as it rarely pops up. The occasional background tune or lament to play during a darker scene works to create ambiance, but there's nothing here that you're going to be putting on your iPod anytime soon. I wish there had been a bit more here, actually. Steins;Gate already has the ability to make you emotional, but those scenes could have been punctuated even more with a truly mesmerizing soundtrack. But alas, despite disappointing a bit, the soundtrack does its job.
A quick mention about the opening song, however: there are many openings that I treasure and that get me excited to watch a show, but ""Hacking to the Gate"" is easily in the top five of all time. It's almost as if the entire animation and soundtrack budget went towards creating this gorgeous two-minute introduction, and I'm certainly not complaining. The vocals are beautiful, the animation is fluid, and there's very good symbolism within it. And yes, there's even a bit of foreshadowing. Seriously, I usually skip an intro, but I never once did here. In fact, I occasionally rewound to take another listen.
Conclusion
Steins;Gate is a rare show, not only because it's an anime involving time travel, but it's a time travel story that's so masterfully written. The characters, especially Okabe and Makise, are just to die for, and the tone escalates naturally and effectively, transforming from happy and goofy to dark and serious. But it never sacrificed the initial integrity of its characters in order to accomplish this task. The foreshadowing was mind-blowingly well executed, and it never devolved into a show about scientific exposition; it always kept its heart, and that's why the second half was so emotionally effective. It's just a shame that some characters felt superfluous and the pacing just wasn't up to par at points, as well as the lackluster production values. Even with those flaws, though, Steins;Gate is a show that everyone should watch, even non-anime fans. It's easily in my top ten anime ever created, and while it can't quite be considered a masterwork, it's definitely something special.",9

                When dealing with time travel in story-writing, one has to look out for many things as such a topic is highly prone to having many plot holes due to being so vast and confusing but then also being so interesting. Steins;Gate takes on that very topic for itself, but does it manage to present itself in a way worthy of such a theme ?
Story:
The story of Steins;Gate starts off a bit slow at first but doesn't take long to take off with a fairly complex plot filled with many twists and also presents the tale of the famous internet legend of 'John Titor' into the
                  mix as a large part of the story and manages to blend that with its own story in a great way. Nearly every step and action  is well thought out and one can not help but notice the amount of effort put into the execution of this show.. But, nothing is ever without its flaws as Steins;Gate does contain a few plot holes and might leave the viewer with some unanswered questions.
Art and Animation:
The art presented in Steins;Gate is well detailed and very polished but not anything too amazing though. The character designs are nicely done and the art-style fits the atmosphere of the Anime well.
The animation is always fairly smooth, movements are good and character actions and expressions are animated well to bring out the personalities of the characters at their fullest.
Sound:
The soundtrack of Steins;Gate does a good job at fitting the situations which further amplified the emotions felt by the viewer, the score was't exactly all that great all the time but did manage to get the job done when it needed to.
The voice acting presented in this Anime is nothing short of amazing, especially when it comes to the main character. All the seiyuus/voice actors did a great job at expressing all the characters to their full potential and drawing out their personalities in the best way possible.
Characters:
This is the department where Steins;Gate shines the most. Every single character in the Steins;Gate universe is explored to their fullest. None of the characters ever seem bland, each and every one of them have their own personalities and are unique in their own ways . There is also ample amounts of character development as the show progresses and the characters slowly change as events unfold.
Presentation:
Steins;Gate manages to keep the viewer wanting more after each episode for almost the entirety of the show, although it did feel slightly repetitive during the second half of the show but that was a minor issue. The twists Steins;Gate presented were ever hardly predictable, it leaves you shocked every time and has you engrossed into the story even more. Some viewers though might be left with a few questions unanswered and events unexplained.
The opening and ending sequences are pretty good, the opening song especially was very fitting to the theme of the Anime along with being a good song on its own.
Conclusion and Verdict:
Despite having a few problems, Steins;Gate stands as one of the most well made Anime's out there, one that in my opinion does the best job at presenting the concepts of time travel. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting story filled with twists, engaging events and awesome characters, give it a go and what you'll find is no doubt an amazing show.",8

                Don't play games! I know you're reading! That's right, freak. It behooves you nothing to ignore me. Take a good look. Quaff deeply from the trough of future shock. Allow that wooly brain to be stricken with envy. You're reading a work from Critic Member 001, anime lover, evil genius, and mad reviewer extraordinaire. 'Tis I... well, I'll think of an alias later. But for now... Steins;Gate. Seriously. Read.
Adapted from a 5pb and Nitro+ visual novel of the same name, Steins;Gate was directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki and Takuya Satou, scripted by Toshizou Nemoto and Jukki Hanada, and produced by White Fox, responsible for other works
                  as Jormungund, Katanagatari, and The Devil is a Part-Timer! Original and anime character designs were drawn up by Ryohei Fuke, otherwise known as huke, and Kyuuta Sakai, respectively. It's another day at the Future Gadgets Lab. Mad Scientist Extraordinaire Okabe Rintarou, otherwise known by his nom de plume Okarin and his in-character nickname Hououin Kyouma, Resident Hack and Cosplayer, Future Gadget #8 (Real Name TBA) and several nuked bananas later, we have Mad Scientist and Hack bickering in their university elevator about text messages and perceived anomalies, events that our main protagonist know occurred, yet, according to Hack, haven't happened. And then Genius Girl Makise Kurisu, a person he could have swore he witnessed dead in a pool of blood, alive or undead. In terms of visuals, White Fox seemed to opt for copious amounts of glare from whatever light source is present juxtaposed by duller tones, darker shades, and shadows to accentuate that uncanny feeling that something's off. This in contrast to other scenes utilizing a slightly richer palette to suck the watcher to be absorbed in the frivolity or sensitivity of the moment. 
Barring the hook of Episode 1's ending, the show's 1st half is a slow build, a build that's an obvious detriment to those expecting an immediate climax into the action. When the shit finally hits the fan in the 2nd half and those who previously criticized the 2nd half's predecessor gets their long sought for release, I speculated whether or not that release would have felt more pleasurable had it come sooner. Would it? Yes, this is all one extended sexual innuendo, and no, it wouldn't. Whether one is conscious of the fact or not, without the 1st half, we would not have felt as strongly about what the cast goes through in the 2nd half. We wouldn't have gotten the opportunity to know the characters behind their stereotypes we put them up to and the facades they disguise themselves under, most poignantly so with Okabe and Makise. We wouldn't have a reason apart from the superficial to connect with them, and the time this characterization occurs allows these connections to happen organically, from moment to moment, rather than through one exhaustive exposition dump. And while messing with the fabric of time is the order of the day, this show also hosts one of the best examples of romance done right. No gimmicky external flirtations or forced internal confessions. Just shared, witty, and sincere moments that are natural extensions of their characters that, before you and they know it, culminate into something intimate, making the next few scenes after this intimacy is realized heartwrenching. This is not to say nothing significant to the plot progresses during this time, because all the while these moments occur, an oppressive atmosphere grows and expands, elucidating this, once again, uncanny feeling. And then a sound of thunder, or silence, or the thunder of one's heart, that dreadful moment you, in the back of your mind, were expecting, that's beyond your control, but uncertain of what specific form it takes. Then, like a gun shot, or a train wreck, or a car crash, it's all over, the pocket watch cracks, the hour glass is shattered, and things fall apart. Then it's a matter of re-piecing what's broken, fighting the good fight against fate. But can he? And if he can, what will he have to sacrifice to make it more than a possibility?
In addition to fate, the show attempts to integrate two different theories of time travel within its narrative: the Multiple Worlds Interpretation and the Butterfly Effect. To better understand the former, imagine this. Any person's past self decides on one act over the other, an act they wouldn't otherwise have committed if they weren't influenced by something sent to them from the future, a text message, for instance. According to the Multiple Worlds Interpretation, that decision results in a shift from one timeline, or world line, to another. Events and memories in this new world line, as opposed to the old one, are modeled after that different decision. The shift occurs only if a different decision was, indeed, made. Were I, for instance, to send a text message to the past such that it would cause the receiver to commit suicide, the world line would shift, or diverge, to a world where the suicide took place. Events and memories in this new world line would correspond both to the shock of the loss and the absence of that person. For more information on the subject, look up Hugh Everett's The Theory of the Universal Wave Function, Bryce DeWitt's The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, and the scoop behind John Titor. To better understand the latter, imagine this. Any act from the current future that would tamper with the past would cause a ripple and snowball effect that would alter what events happen and what memories are made in the altered future. The further back in time the tampering, the more drastic and seemingly random the outcome, regardless of how insignificant said tampering, such as the death of a butterfly, appears. For more information on the subject, read up on Ray Bradbury's ‚ÄúA Sound of Thunder.‚Äù
For casual watchers, the supposed utilization of these two theories working together makes for great drama, and indeed, Steins;Gate is able to pull off this drama quite well. There are, however, some bits of it that fall because of some theoretical misuse. For one, for all the misadventures and mishaps involving time that occur in the series, the Butterfly Effect is only effectively demonstrated twice, the soda scene and Ruka's sex. The rest can be conceivably chalked up to Multiple Worlds Interpretation, so that begs the question as to why the story to integrate the theory at all if it's barely used. The reason, in my opinion, was to provide a convenient safety net for drama and logic that wouldn't be dramatic or even logical without it. The Butterfly Effect as a drama device works properly if its fatalistic consequences, the loss of control over one's destiny, legitimately pervade throughout. When it's used only twice, and used lazily, then that tension, when looking from retrospect, falls flat. Then there's this point. For knowledgeable time travel fans or observant folk, these two theories are contradictory. Any tampering effect to the past, such as the aforementioned text messages, should result in a divergence, independent of whether or not a different decision was made. Reading Steiner, the ability for the mind to brave the memory overwriting shifts, lacks a solid foundation behind its existence, one that doesn't so much bother me as it has others. While Ruka's gender identity and transgender issues in general are certainly problems no one should take lightly, they feel out of place and immersion breaking in the swath of other events that are far more pressing. Lastly, while each cast member fulfills their role in the plot reasonably well and have a meaningful amount of depth, depth that was naturally coaxed out rather than artificially hastened, there is a definite depth inequality between some recurring characters over others, and an argument which I don't particularly subscribe to as a detriment, even if I bought it, wherein Okabe is the only person who gets any meaningful character development.
The OP, Kanako Ito's ‚ÄúHacking to the Gate,‚Äù utilizes a series of staticky animation overlays, character clones, flash images, and hyperdrive blurs to excellent effect. Plenty is going on that I'd never get bored watching it, and indeed, new things seemed to pop out to me with each particular, and old things that popped out suddenly gained new meaning as the show progressed. To that effect, the OP is a masterful display of foreshadow, foreshadow to events and elements that the story would later introduce and explore. The music itself is a blend of Ito's natural vocals and techno synthetics that, like the visuals themselves, establish an energetically erratic atmosphere. Yui Sakakibara's ‚ÄúToki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku,‚Äù translated ‚ÄúThe Time-Governing Twelve Covenants,‚Äù is the ED for all but the last three episodes. Its visuals consists of a broken pocket watch, a shattered hour glass, and an exposed Makise, visuals which, again, lay subtle amounts of foreshadow to events and come and, once those events have passed, bitter reminders of those experiences. The vocalist, accompanied by a melancholy piano, a mesmerizing drum beat, and an intense guitar strum, is a passionate croon laced with mires of biting tragedy. Episode 22 ED by Takeshi Abo, ‚ÄúFake Verthandi,‚Äù Episode 23 ED, by Kanako Ito, ‚ÄúSky Clad no Kansokusha,‚Äù translated ‚ÄúSky Clad Observer,‚Äù Episode 24 ED, also by Kanako Ito, ‚ÄúAnother Heaven,‚Äù are all songs that have to be discussed in context to be fully appreciated. And because that context involves spoilers, I suggest just getting to those points in the show yourselves to experience them...
...and the rest of the narrative. Outside of some inconsistencies, Steins;Gate is an excellent show, something I'd recommend time travel junkies, sci-fi fans, anime lovers, anyone who wants to enjoy a great story with a great cast and doesn't mind the slow build to get there. Now's the matter of dubbing the name of this endeavor. Operation... shit, what name would go great for this from Norse Mythology? El Psy Congroo? No wait, that's Latin and Greek...
I give Steins;Gate a 9 out of 10.",9
"
                This anime is too damn overhyped. It was complete garbage. The first 12 episodes are disgustingly slow, bad, and unappealing. And the characters just suck, they are so boring and one dimensional. They didn't feel real, they just felt like convenient plot devices. I couldn't care less who died, they were just so BORING and useless and the main character was just a waste of time. You're telling me this buffoon who is constantly talking to himself and isn't funny whatsoever built a time machine. Every time he pretended to be a mad scientist i just wanted him to shut the fuck up. 
The only
                  redeeming quality is the suspense, a suspense you only really get to experience after the worst 12 episodes you will ever watch in your life. I'm not gonna lie, I was interested in finding out how the MC was going to solve his problem and I was hoping the anime would get as good as everyone said it would. But every episode was damn near unbearable, I couldnt understand the hype, I was trying so desperately to find out what was actually good about this anime. I hated almost every single cast member in this show, absolutely despised their uni-dimensionality. ""TUTURU"" more like just fucking die please.
After completing this anime I felt disgusted, in much the same way you would feel disgusted after masturbating to some questionable porn.
Never again... I am never again watching this horrible anime",1

                Steins;Gate is an absolute masterpiece. Released in 2011 but still better than most sci-fi shows for 9 straight years. It is not a stretch to say this anime is the best of the best of all time. And I put it on the top of my list, the number one spot. 
( Spoiler Free Review ) 
Story: 10/10
Steins;Gate has progressive pacing and episodic in nature, I was confused the first time when I have watched Steins;Gate, as much as it was confusing I enjoyed how the show progresses throughout per episode. The story was very unique for me when I first watched it, and that
                  especially made me like it. It was not predictable at all since the show can go in a lot of ways. The pacing was very good, There is no room for fillers and each episode holds a purpose. The individual elements of the story are absolutely perfect. Comedy, romance, mystery, a little fan service, suspense, and thriller. All aspects are superb, the deus ex machina in the anime is shown, and is very well used. And literary techniques and or tropes are present. The ending is very satisfying, heartwarming, kind, beautiful and anticipating. As much as I don't want it to end. There is no forced abrupt ending. It was well paced and well done. 
Art: 10/10
The art style fits perfectly well with the story, it has a distinctly unique style to it that fits well with the atmosphere of the anime. It's the perfect art style for a perfect anime. The director did a perfect job in setting up the mood with the art style. Throughout the anime, the animation was well done and consistent. The backgrounds were unique as well, the character designs perfectly fit with the character's personalities, and I love it with all of my heart. Each character design is unique to their own styles, I don't find any problem with wearing the same clothing as I find it quite irrelevant to an anime like Steins;Gate. 
Sound: 10/10
I absolutely love the OST' of Steins;Gate. The voice actors are one of the main reasons for the greatness of this show. And they delivered in a perfect manner. I'm sure that Okabe Rintarou's voice actor had to make a few adjustments with his voice and for Makise Kurisu's as well. Both voice actors played a big part in the anime and I can only thank them for a great job well done, I am very grateful. The background music was a blast as well, It's very emotional I must say, It also helped a big part in setting up the atmosphere and mood throughout the story. I love it. The music in Steins;Gate was always a big part in setting up the entire show's tone. I'd listen to the OST of Steins;Gate from time to time since it's that good, very memorable. The opening and ending songs are both perfect and notable. 
Character: 10/10
The best part of Steins;Gate is the characters. Each is unique in their own way and well rounded. They have flaws and they need each other. And that's what makes them perfect. The characters reacted rationally and emotionally depending upon the situation that they are currently facing. I was able to relate to the characters and their hardships. Each character in some way or another had their own development throughout the show. But more so to our main characters. There are foils for our main character and one that is always right next to him. Mostly Okabe Rintarou is the most fleshed out of the bunch since the main story is focused on him but not entirely, the antagonist of the show is well developed and has backgrounds and depths like the other characters. And to each has their own motivations for doing things. The supporting cast as well is filled with highly well written, likable characters and development. The narration in the show is present in some parts with the main characters like Okabe Rintarou, it simply made the series more aesthetic. A specific character I really disliked was Kiryu Moeka and it was probably the author's intention for me to hate her, and it worked. The characters in Steins;Gate are the most memorable character's I have had the pleasure to be able to watch, and I'll surely remember them forever, etched into my mind. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
I think that the majority of people will be able to enjoy this series. If they gave the time and patience towards this series they will be rewarded with good fortune in return. This may be hard for non-anime fans to get into unless they are a huge sci-fi fan or have the patience to wait it out or enjoy the pace of the show. I have already re-watched this anime 3 times. And I'm planning to watch it again in the near future. It's an unforgettable story and the pinnacle of greatness in anime. Even if I know what's going on and what's going to happen, I still get goosebumps every time I hear that opening. And whenever I re-watch it I was able to pick up some things I haven't seen during the first time I have watched it. This show is precious enough that I'd pay money to buy the source material and support the show for a new season. Steins;Gate is a memoir and will always hold a special place in my heart. It's my very first sci-fi anime after all.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is an anime that was recommended to me by a friend telling me that it was a brilliant Sci-fi anime with a thrilling plot. So I decided to give it a try and see what happens. This was one experience that I feel I will never have again.
Story- 8.9
Steins;Gate initially centres around the idea of time travel and the effects of the time travel and the way in which the machine works. Within the inner workings of the machine and we see the ‚Äúscience‚Äù behind how it works. All of this is very believable as it all seems rather plausible due to its lack
                  of flamboyance and its grounded roots in reality. However this scenario does not last for the entirety of the anime as the latter half shifts into thriller with time travel twist added in. In this latter half the anime becomes plot driven rather than being driven by the sci-fi elements that we were presented with in the first half of the anime and the pacing picks up to high pitch fervour which keeps you on the edge of your seat.
But throughout the anime the sci-fi elements are rarely the focal point of the show and it gives great emphasis on the character interactions and how they develop. This is where Steins;Gate becomes brilliant since it puts so much focus on these interactions it greatly increases our immersion into the fictional world. However there are some minor grievances that I have with plot of this anime is a couple of episodes in the second half of the series which focuses on two of the supporting characters detract from the overall immersion I had with this series. Also the pacing at the start of the anime can be seen as quite slow but I feel that it is necessary as it builds up lot character interactions which only add the immersion. Overall the story of Steins;Gate is original and quite brilliant with some minor hiccups along the way.
Art- 9.1
The animation for Steins;Gate is done the studio White Fox and I have to say that they have done magnificently well. The character movements are very well catered for as they are fluid and crisp and there is no moment where the quality drops. This is also true for the background and it recreates the vibrant atmosphere of Akihabara quite nicely. The animation style is quite unique in this day and age as all the characters have quite realistic facial proportions. However on some occasions they use zany animation styles and it is very effective as it perfectly coincides with the heightened sense of danger or urgency of the scene. On the whole the character designs are new and refreshing but there are a couple of instances where they do seem a bit bland and unoriginal. Also when the slow motions scenes take place the animation does feel a bit choppy. However these are minor flaws among what is an excellent visual display.
Sound- 8.65 (OST -8.1 Voice Acting-9.2)
The Soundtrack for S;G is very minimalistic and relies on ambient noises rather than musical tracks to create the atmosphere. This approach can lead to the lack of any atmosphere being created but in the case of Steins;Gate it is rather effective and suits the overall feel of the anime. However that is not to say that musical tracks are not utilised and when they are utilised they are very effective in setting the mood. Unfortunately none of the tracks are so good that they are memorable apart from one very special exception: The OP. The OP for this anime is truly brilliant and makes me want to watch the whole anime again just so that I can listen to it in all its glory. So overall it‚Äôs a very good OST with, at least for me, one very special track.
Fortunately I have had the pleasure of watching this anime both subbed and dubbed and while I can‚Äôt really comment on the voice acting of the Japanese, I can say that it does sound as if it has been acted with a great amount of passion and feels as if the whole cast had a blast whilst doing it.
The Dub is an entirely different matter. After watching the sub I can say that I was rather cautious when approaching the dub but all those feelings of scepticism that I had were left behind in the depths of the oceans as soon as I watched the first episode. The voice acting for this anime was brilliant from start to finish with each voice actor perfectly portraying each character that they voiced. Each emotion, ranging from exasperation to sorrow, was felt when they spoke and it was thoroughly enjoyable to listen to. The only slight negative I could see was the script on one occasion did feel a bit iffy but apart from that it is truly excellent performance from everyone involved.   
Characters- 9.2
The characters in Steins;Gate are what I feel are the highlight of the whole show and without them this how would have landed flat on its face. To me, even though each character fits into some type of stereotype they never feel confined to that and expand and develop beyond those boundaries. Our MC, Okabe Rintarou, is quite a unique character and is possibly one of the most enjoyable characters that I have ever watched in anime. His quirks and ramblings are wonderfully entertaining but it is his interactions with our lead female, Makise Kirisu, which creates for some of the best moments in this anime. It is mainly my connection with these two characters that immersed me within this world and kept glued to my laptop for hours on end yearning for the best possible outcome. My only gripe is that a couple of the characters feel like an added accessory to the already very good cast but apart from that it is a very good showing in general.
Enjoyment- 9.5
I loved Steins;Gate from Start to finish. The earlier episodes may have been slow but they were still very enjoyable to watch especially the comedic moments and when the anime shifted to a more serious tone it kept at the edge of my seat for as long as I can remember. The time travel was still far enough out there to be sci-fi but close enough to home so that I could grasp the general idea that they were laying down in front of me. The characters literally sold me the show as it was my connection to most of them which was very enjoyable to have and therefore made the anime glorious to watch.
Overall- 9.07
Steins;Gate is a different outlook on the time travel ‚Äúgenre‚Äù and gives an new breath of fresh air into what, at times, is a rather stale premise. The it builds upon this premise to give us a unique experience which relies on its characters rather than the plot to immerse you in its world.
Thanks for reading this I hope that this review has been helpful. And, as always, any feedback is greatly appreciated =D",9
"
                The issue I had with this anime is that it doesn't even want to try to tell a good story. It's a show made by people who are afraid of or unable to push the envelope in any way and as a result of taking almost no risks whatsoever, it totally fails to be compelling. This review will contain major spoilers.
0. Bad science
This is a more personal beef I had with the series because I personally have worked a lot in research settings, but I'm going to say it first. For all the lip service the crew pays to being scientists they don't display ANY
                  curiosity or drive, at all. Like, you turned your banana into gel using your microwave. Holy shit! That's a big deal and a major discovery. What will our intrepid crew do to investigate this phenomenon? This is the opportunity of a lifetime to find out something incredible! IRL scientists would kill for this opportunity that just happened to fall into our protagonist's lap! What does he do?
He does jack shit. He makes absolutely no effort to test the properties of the weird gel in any way other than... eating some??? What? He doesn't come up with any theories of how it might work. He doesn't test the situations under which it works to any meaningful degree. He doesn't test a variety of items in the microwave that have different properties, to see if he can observe anything interesting. It's bananas and more bananas. He doesn't realize it's related to his landlord's TV until pretty late in the series... if he had bothered running experiments on the microwave at different timepoints throughout the entire day he would have figured something like that out much earlier on. Like come on, Light Yagami from Death Note at least tested out what he could do with the note almost immediately after he got it and that guy never pretended that he was a scientist. 
When Kurisu, who is ostensibly a genius who's established in research, arrives, she doesn't have any curiosity either! The crew just figures out how to do one thing, which is send D-mails back in time, and just keeps doing that thing to solve a bunch of random petty personal problems until everything goes to shit. Who cares how it all works? Who cares what the range of what it can do is? Who cares about its limitations? Who cares about possible aspects of its functionality that can be exploited in interesting ways? Not these guys! Because, just because you wear a lab coat and like to say big words and know how to plug numbers into a few math equations, doesn't mean you're a scientist. These guys are LARPing and are only interested in appearances.
1. Plot
For a time travel anime in particular, having a well structured plot and established rules (worldbuilding if you want to call it that) is CRITICAL. Steins;gate totally fails in this regard. And unless this is your first ever time watching a time travel show, Steins;gate brings absolutely nothing new to the table. For the most part, it follows cliches that are staple to the genre in order to manufacture drama, but because the rules are so poorly explained a lot of the drama ended up feeling cheap. 
For instance: why the hell are timelines organized the way they are? Why do we need 1% divergence, and not 2% or 10%? How is the percentage even calculated, if it's from the beginning of time itself making a change to a few years isn't even going to be .001%. How does the machine calculate the divergence difference between timelines? There doesn't seem to be a way to select 2 timelines as inputs. How did that machine get made anyways? Why is Okabe's other timeline self vastly more competent than this timeline's self and why can't we follow that story instead since everyone is so much more interesting there? Why can Okabe magically remember everything from the previous timeline? Just because you give the phenomenon a fancy name like ""Reading Steiner"" doesn't actually explain anything! Jargon like ""lifter"" also explains nothing. I might as well say that they time travel because of ""aether lines"" and in order to activate their time travel machine they need to ""ignite their inner chi using the prismatic rainbow crystal"", it's just as informative and changes nothing in the plot.
Why do they have to undo all of their D-mails to prevent Mayuri's death? If all you need is 1% divergence, why not diverge in another direction? Make even more changes to the world and hop into a World Line C! They could potentially go shopping across all possible world lines until they find one they like this way, since changes are additive.
Why is Mayuri's death arbitrarily chosen as the one event that defines the timeline? From a storytelling perspective, sure it adds drama. But why would the universe give a shit if Mayuri dies? It seems arbitrary that THIS is what the timeline is apparently built on, rather than something like, knocking over a can in when strolling through the park. It's like fate itself just wants to punch Mayuri in the face repeatedly because the ways in which she dies have no logical basis a lot of the time. When she died from being randomly pushed into a train by the landlord's daughter, the writers actually had the audacity to try to milk the moment for tragedy and drama. I was just floored by how stupid the whole thing was.
Why does Okabe need to recreate the scene of Kurisu's death to get to the Steins;gate timeline? Isn't that timeline a completely separate world line from the beta line? Why wouldn't this work: Okabe saves Kurisu and swaps the Oopa. Since Kurisu isn't dead now, world line changes to Steins;gate, easy as that. Why the requirement for his past self to see her body? This is a weird mechanic. Could they have gotten to Steins;gate by faking Mayuri's original death instead somehow? The show does a pretty poor job of explaining why this needs to be done which leaves it feeling very contrived.
For all the talking the show likes do about the chaos theory and butterfly effect, it sure sucks at showing the butterfly effect in practice. Every change that gets made to the timeline that's arbitrarily ""allowed"" (aka doesn't directly prevent Mayuri from dying) has an extremely direct and obvious consequence and no others. This just feels like lazy writing from writers who didn't want to deal with having to vary too much of the world and character relationships between different timelines.
Here's something minor that also really annoyed me: Faris just shrugs and decides to let her dad be dead again because she doesn't want Mayuri to die. But... did anyone consider maybe, you know, asking her dad what he thought about being dead...? Since presumably he's a living conscious person now who should probably be asked about this kind of thing? I bet he has an opinion on this subject. But nah, the show isn't interested in a potential conflict that would actually be meaningful.
Beyond stupid storytelling choices made out of either laziness or the desire to come up with cheap drama with no emotional payoff because no one really cares (the landlord's plotline was a joke), the show was full of tedious filler in the first half. Maybe it would have been easier to sit through if the character interactions were more than a couple of tired cliches bouncing off each other.
2. Characters
This is why trying to tell a serious story out of a harem romance sim does not work: the female characters are barely characters at all. They were all designed to be likeable first and foremost, cute second, useful third, and maybe a few token efforts were made to make any of them interesting as human beings. 
Every character is based on a cliche: chuuni Okabe, a tsundere, a catgirl, a ""trap"" (with obligatory tasteless jokes), an imouto, a pervert, zzz... Only Suzuha actually talks like a normal human. Moeka doesn't have a trope that I can identify but she also doesn't really act recognizably like a human being either. A lot of their dialogue is ridiculous because of this, people do not interact this way in reality.
The main character is very passive and mostly just goes along with what other people ask him to do until Mayuri starts dying. For the most part he only reacts to events that happen to him. This isn't necessarily bad, it's just kind of bland. The only character who goes out of their way to do things is Suzuha. I liked the scene where she ran down to turn on the lifter right before the SERN team arrived to kill Mayuri. Something irritating though is that the time traveler characters are infuriatingly vague about information that would actually be meaningful for the other characters to know. They don't even have the excuse of ""you would never believe me"" because the whole crew has been working on time travel for a long while. Okabe has absolutely no reason to hide the problems that he's facing especially since after he tells Kurisu she just helps him and there's no random retribution from the hand of fate or anything.
Of course, the hacker best friend who's actually competent enough to contribute meaningfully to the progression of the plot... is a fat NEET who constantly sexually harrasses the female cast, because the writers are just THAT terrified that the main character isn't good enough to land a girlfriend unless there are absolutely NO other reasonable male options available to the girls. Because if there was a single other dude character in the show who wasn't an obese pervert or otherwise undateable, the girls would come to their senses and it would be totally unbelievable that any of them would choose to date Okabe. Whether or not this hypothetical is actually true is up to you, but the point is: the writers were too afraid to even let there be any possible competition for the main character. This is just one of many parts in their conga line of shitty and cowardly storytelling decisions. Anyways, we end up with an incredibly obnoxious asshole on the cast who no one really likes very much. Thanks, Hamasaki/Sato/Kobayashi.
Kurisu is one of the major characters of the show and the primary love interest. She's also a walking tsundere cliche which is really astonishing since she's also supposed to be a 4channer. You'd think she'd have some self awareness, but nah she doesn't, since women aren't people of course. Apparently the only thing she got from browsing 4chan in her free time is the ability to recognize and parrot a few entry level memes which I guess is enough for a nerd audience to fall in love with her. Somehow after being on 4chan for some time she still gets flustered by lewd comments which is seriously impressive. One thing that annoyed me immensely about her story was that apparently she was a spy for SERN in another timeline. Then I heard that officially, she had never wanted to work for them and that she was forced to, which resolves her of any wrongdoing. Way to kill any interesting character conflict or development, writing team! Apparently they think people are afraid of seeing a female character who also might not be a paragon of perfect morality, so they decided to rob her of any agency and say oh, it's okay, she was being forced to be bad. Why is it so insane to imagine that a successful student might jump at the chance to work for a prestigious organization and get access to cool tools like the hadron collider? Wouldn't it be more interesting if we could see that Kurisu isn't a perfect angel and that in the right circumstances she might be willing to go along with something evil? Doesn't that make a more interesting statement about human nature? But nope, that's not the kind of conflict the writers like.
The rest of the harem girls are more or less the same as her. They're meant to be cute, and have just enough backstory to make you sad for them and therefore like them. They sometimes will have a hobby or something, but don't worry, they will never have any character traits that indicate that they might actually be human beings rather than perfect nymphs.",3

                In recent years, I can't help but feel that the realm of anime has hit a point of utter stagnation. True, there have been well-produced shows, but many of these fall into the background, overcome by the flood of the extremely-overrated (not to bash any fans, but a great example would be the Pokemon series. C'mon people, just leave it as a game) and constantly recycled. From mecha-animes with repeating themes of justice and revenge to supernatural-themed shows attempting to make something new by making it look more flashy and impressive. Let's be honest with ourselves, in light of a lack of creativity, we've enjoyed
                  (though perhaps not to a point where our jaws have dropped) constantly repeated genres.
Upon first spotting the artwork for Steins;Gate on several image boards, I was intrigued and looked it up on ANN and MyAnimeList. To be utterly blunt, despite being impressed with the art-style of huke, the premise of ""an eclectic group of individuals who have the ability to send text messages to the past"" had me a little skeptical. Based on that sentence alone, I concluded that it might just simply become another failed attempt at a sci-fi thriller. However, it piqued my attention when I found that it was ranked #2 on ANN's ""Top 10 Best Rated"" list (in both the bayesian estimate and weighted averages) with a very impressive average score of 9.17 out of 10. After that, I concluded I had to watch it to see what all the fuss was about.
Let me start off by saying that Steins;Gate is no normal anime in any sense.
The series starts early off with tongue-and-cheek comedy, playing heavily on the theme of nerds doing nerdy things with a self-proclaimed mad scientist who talks on the phone with no one on the other end, an otaku hacker with a hobby of visiting maid cafes, and a cosplaying girl with no care in the world. It may seem standard at the beginning, but the series picks up its pace as more characters join the motley crew and entangle themselves in a dangerous conspiracy that they would have never imagined themselves to ever be stuck in the middle of.
Perhaps some of the really impressive work comes into play when Steins;Gate jumps feet first into the hard-science that drives the anime for nearly half of the episodes. At first glance, all of the difficult chit-chat about physics and super-old super-retro computers might seem boring. Though this may be true, all of it builds up into a super-charged, edge-of-your-seat thriller that makes this 24-episode series into a truly exciting and entertaining masterpiece. By the time you reach the final episodes where the main character is racing to undo the damage he has caused, you won't want to stop watching until the end.
The overall character design makes the cast of Steins;Gate extremely memorable (however, like most animes, it would seem that they all have an endless number of copies of the same outfit). But, in the end, the clothing helps to define each character in their own unique way. The backdrops - based primarily in the mega-metropolis of Akihabara - are extremely well-done, reflecting an interestingly gray (yet strangely beautiful) urban setting,
Steins;Gate ended with a strong note, having a very-powerful punch for an extremely young (and recent) anime. It serves as a very notable (and wonderful) addition to the time-travel genre, paying homage to its spiritual sci-fi predecessors. Despite being rife with familiar plot elements found in films such as the Back to the Future trilogy, it exists as its own story populated by unique characters, mentally-stimulating twists, and a visual style that will undoubtedly keep you hooked.
By the time you finish Episode 24 and the timer reads 23:38, you'll want to build your own microwave-time-leap machine and (uttering the signature code words of Okabe Rintar≈ç) relive the entire thrill all over again.
""No one knows what the future holds.
That's why it's potential is infinite, just as this meeting demonstrates.
This is the choice of Steins Gate.""

                Steins;Gate in my opinion is an overrated anime. Before you outright disagree, read the review. One thing I would say beforehand: This anime had potential in storyline. MAJOR potential to stand out and be different and enjoyable. Yet it messed up.
For those who can't read the complete review here are some highlights:
1. Took me (and others I know) up to 12 episodes to start properly enjoying
2. Major plot holes or moments that seem only to keep the story going but don't make much sense
3. Moments that pull it back in the 'typical anime' realm
First I will go over the positive aspects:Art 9/10
The art in Steins;Gate is good. The colors are crisp and the backgrounds are well done. While the faces are not that well defined, when required, facial expressions are fully conveyed and the atmosphere is one a person can almost feel.
Sound 9/10
The sound is also a positive aspect - the feeling of dread or something terrible/sinister on one side and playful banter on the other is well managed and I enjoyed both the combination of art and sound.
Now a mediocre aspect:
Characters 7/10
Character development in this anime was good. BUT it could have been better. Let me explain. The characters have certain traits that makes you want to remember them: Daru is a pervert, Okabe is a mad scientist, Christina (for those who enjoyed the tone of Okabe saying this the first time) and Mayuri... she comes across as slightly odd but I will come to that. Now while all these char's have their traits, they seem as if they are confined in very confined boundaries. You (or at least I) cannot predict their actions in any random situation. Then Mayuri seemed a bit too much like Tomo from Seikon no Qwasar. A bit odd for a normal life setting. Don't get me wrong - I do get she had her share of experiences but that was a bit off. Then another thing that felt too typical anime-ish was how good Okabe is (when he feels like it) and that everyone is, perhaps slowly, liking him too much (except Daru perhaps).
Story + Enjoyment 6/10
Time Travel lovers go straight for a 10 in this category but sadly it did not appeal to me that much. There were major plot holes, major places where I thought that a specific event happened only for the sake of giving the story a specific turn.
Now to enjoyment - it took me 12 out of the 24 episodes to actually GET INTO the anime. And I am one of those people who ends a short anime when they start it, evaluating it only at the end. But I could pinpoint to the exact moment I felt like ""okay, now it is worth watching.
The story DID have some good portions as well! But the negatives for me outweigh those.
So while I have probably skipped a lot/jumbled things up/confused you, I would like to say that I am not going to review this review over and over and so my verdict is that the idea was brilliant but due to some major plot holes and typical anime elements it did not meet up to expectations. Still, a good anime for those who enjoy the time travel. Happy Watching.",7

                *Virgin reviewer so be gentle*
People will always ask other people what to watch, recommend me something, im so bored what should i watch. People will also say is there ever going to be another masterpiece like Brotherhood or when is something going to become as popular as Death note. What will have the sheer guts to move me to the next episode, to make me want to watch and not go to sleep. WHAT anime is going to be the next big thing and blow my mind for days, weeks, months and even years. well its two simple words and for people to know that
                  these two simple words mean nothing but everthing, Steins;Gate.
This Will be a classic anime in the years to come, people will still talk about great anime's like Death Note, Brotherhood, Code Geass and Suzumiya Haruhi, however they will be talking about Steins;Gate as well.
Story: 10
IF you watch 3 episodes of this you will not need a time machine to see how good this can be, will be, and is. The story revolves around Okabe Rintarou or the Mad Scientist. One day after seeing a certain predicament, he finds himself in a loop. The cause, a make shift time machine that will send his texts back in time. He then finds out the first message has altered the future in a big way. After that he then helps his fellow friends by making there dreams come true. The only problem is he will now have to skip between time lines to make everything right. He then finds out he is blessed with a certain power that helps him between jumps and after jumps through time. This stories base is certainly not that original, a time machine has been done in tv, anime's, movies and so on. The difference lady/gentle otakus, the execution of the story mixed with comedy and all together random moments. It has a serious plot line with comical sub plots that eventually tie the story in a nice little ball for all people to see.
Art: 9
This might just be me being biased but the art was great. It fit with the character designs and semi futuristic vibe towards the end and everything in between. Im not trying to say its spectacular or you need to watch this anime just for the Art, It simply fits with the overall masterpiece that is Steins;Gate. The Art goes from a little bubbly at times that fits with the nonchalant help my lab members to dark and twisted, with half trippy vibes you get from the time machine factor.
Sound: 9
Im at a loss on what to say here, the sound just works. But out of all honesty you will be to focused on what is going on to even realize the shrills and bravado that is going on. I gave this a 9 based on the fact it works with the moods, character development and overall enjoyment of the show. Also because there was never a time when the music pissed me off and distracted me from watching which is hard to do in most anime's, the sound is either to loud, noisy, or just doesn't fit the bill with some bubble gum pop rock garbage. when you watch you will understand what im trying to convey.
Characters: 10
It just has to be, it just does. i wont even say 1 episode it will only take FIVE MINUTES for you to realize this is a crazy cast of different types of characters all meshed into a group almost like how Durarara!! was. Lets start the Bar with Okabe, the main character. He is over the top shatter the mold ""mad scientist"", Feelings of ups and downs insanely crazy and moronic to insanely brilliant and sharp. solving different parts to the puzzle, piecing the facts together, live and death struggle and impossible choices that are choose impossibly well. CHRISTINA!!!! or Kurisu Makise. The zombie, and perverted genius girl celebrity. 17 years old and a genius. (she also looks good in a lab coat MUAHAHAHA) she is with out a doubt a huge piece of the puzzle she is the Glue to this anime. She is first seen in the first episode in a sort of ""bad"" situation. she makes this story possible. Next Do Do Do DO Mayuri. I said Kurisu was the glue... i might have to take that back, when the story starts out you seen her for who she is and when its finished its the same good hearted girl that you will come to love. Every time she was on the screen i could not look away, she fascinated me from start to finish with her bright personality and sometimes to nice of a person, she is one of the better better female characters in my mind and the sad thing is she is not the best girl in this anime as you will see. Lets review the previous characters and characters i haven't mentions in bulk shall we. mad scientist that is crazy, lazy, good for nothing, sane, brilliant good for the world type of guy. 17 year old genius tsunedere with alot to prove nothing to gain, then nothing to prove everything to gain, gain and loss type. bubbly cute, happily funny, adorable and nice Mayuri. a Fat NEET Otaku suuupppa hacka with a maid complex. A most of the time cross dressing man, some times not so gross dressing women/man who is a shrine maiden with a hard crush and sometimes Broken heart. Moe cosplay maid fancy rich girl who has nothing while at the same time has everything but would rather have one thing than everything. future girl who sometimes knows everything, looking for her father when he is under her nose. A average store owner who is not so average nice but hard on rent then mean and murderous. Ok take all that into consideration and try to put those characters in any other anime and make it work.... you tired and failed why, because it can not be done.
Enjoyment: 10
come on if you actually read this review thus far you would have a very good idea to why this was so enjoyable, and if you made it this far here *Gold Star*
Overall: 10
Child Please! twist's and turns, abnormally fantastic character development, surprisingly simply and complex at the same time. At the end you will be thinking about what was said for weeks to come, it has been months since i have watched this and i remember it so very clearly. That is the sign of a great anime.
Final thought...
WATCH! or else there wont be any time machines in the future! and we all want time machines, this deserves its score, its not some hyper inflated anime that has been made up from hype. watch, listen, read, learn..... you must do it John Titor said so.",10
"
                Tuturu !
I was skeptical about this anime. So much praise. This couldn't be true. This has to be overhyped somehow. Somehow...? Maybe this anime was not juste an anime after all ? This changed my vision of the world around me. Despite not wanting to watch this, especially because the synopsis and reviews seemed to be bland in my opinion, I opened the pandora box. Was it worth it ? OH BOY, it sure was! So rewarding. Now onto the review. I'm here to open your mind and incite you to do so by watching this wonder.
Oh dear, how can I start?
You have to know
                  that this isn't some kind of anime adapted like crap as we become slowly used to (be it from mangas or video games). This was adapted from a succesful Visual Novel.
Visual Novel ? In short it's like reading a book, but YOU make your own choices and the story evolves based on them. So fitting for this anime in a sense... Coincidence ? I don't think so. The V.N often only include some still pictures for cutscenes, if you don't like reading and imaginating the events (to some extent) then it'll be boring for you. This V.N was released on Xbox, then PC/Windows and PSP, but, hey only in Japan =) If you can't read Japanese you don't have to worry about missing something here, the anime covers almost everything (well you have ""good"" routes and ""bad ending"" routes... And the anime covers only one ending logically)
Anyway, this sumed up where this wonder came from. Or did it ? In a sense, it's no wonder that the story is so well written. Visual Novels should mostly be based on the storyline. It's written and thinked quite some time in advance, contrary to weekly serialized mangas for example. But it's not just that. Other V.N have been adapted, and they were not as popular as STEINS;GATE.
Why is it so popular? Why?
It has LOTS of real life connections. Beware, if your mind is not prepared it will blow up. I warned you ! You'll spend countless nights dreaming about this... You'll see real town settings, drinks, computer, internet references, as easter-eggs. Coincidence? I don't think so.
This was all well prepared in advance in fact.
The story seems pretty bland at first. Okabe, Rintarou is the main protagonist. He seems really annoying and stupid at first glance. But he has some interesting motives: He's trying, along with his two friends Hashida, Itaru, a weird geeky hentai amateur otaku, and Shiina, Mayuri his childhood friend, to make some ""Future Gadgets""...
First two or three episodes, you'll be bored. You CANNOT understand what's going on. It's because your mind is not ready yet. You don't know the truth. Yet it'll become all clear when you ""clear"" the story. That's one of this anime's feats of strength: its story has lots of details, and you can't grasp it all in only one watching. Thus the replay value is incredible. That is, if TIME TRAVELLING amazes you.
If you're into basic action shonen or romance shojo (yeah, I'm reducing those styles for the metaphor) you may or may not be interested in this story.
This story start SUPER SLOWLY, but will soon DELIVER to blow your mind. You HAVE TO watch at least FIVE EPISODES to get ready for this.
And thus started the RollerCoaster of Emotions... Get yourself a handkerchiefs box, it'll be needed. I cried more tears of joy and sadness than in the past 10 years. And I saw some stuff to tell you the truth.
Anyway, onto the characters themselves.
As I said, it starts like a boring slice of life comedy. But is it really only that ? HELL NO. Characters in here have some major developments. Nothing is left half assed. Every character has a back story, and important interactions with the main character, self proclaimed ""Mad Scientist!"". They are all interesting, touching, like real people you'd cherish, characters. 
With this storyline and characters, you can expect some great moments of funny comedy, love romance and dramatic plot twists.
By now you should be pretty much excited to do this. You'll just have to bear the slow start of this anime, and get ready for the awesomeness that comes after that. You have to be worth it. 
The music is fabulous, fitting EVERY situation. The seiyus are incredible, they seem so real you could touch them ! 
The visuals are stunning. The directing as well. Truely, nothing can be criticized. Nothing is done by chance here. This is a masterpiece.
Why are you wasting time reading this ? Come on, watch this opening, you'll get thrilled by now, and go watch this ! The future of this world depends on you!

                Steins;Gate is definetly one of the best animes I have ever seen.
The story 10/10
It is brilliant! The first episode might make you wanna drop it since it's a bit weird but if you pay attention it makes sense in a way.(you'll get what I mean at the end of the series).They leave a small clue in like the first 10 episodes that will be picked up later and that's how they draw you win. Pretty much when the first big event happen (you will know what I am talking about when you watch the series), you will be hooked because that moment in the series
                  just defines it as...awesome. You will be like ""wha...did that just happen...wait wha???""
Also this is one , if not the only, anime that manages to tell a really good time travel story that you could actually think it's plausible! So SF fans be sure to check it out, you won't regret it.
Characters 10/10
The cast is quite varied and very engaging. You have the mad scientis Okabe Rintarou who invents a time travelling microwave, with the help of the awesome (honestly she must be one of my favourite characters ) Makise Kurisu and the ""hacker"" Mashida Itaru. The rest of the cast is also quite good  though you will hate one of them eventually (not for being a bad written character, just for being bad).
Art   10/10
The art is unique and everything is drawn really good. Really enjoyed it.
Sound   10/10
The voice acting is top notch and very good. The actors manage to emanate the characters feeling through their voice and that's always a good thing!!!
Enjoyment   10/10
Watched in 2 days (had school or it would have been 1 day for sure:)).
Overall    10/10
Overall Steins;Gate provides the viewer with a believable and engaging time travelling story, with well written characters, with very good art and voice acting and it's a must watch for any anime fan out there!!",10
"
                In a nutshell, the least successful amalgam of comedy and drama that I have ever seen.
As a comedy, Steins;Gate ranges tolerable to entertaining, but as a drama, it falls apart completely. Its characters are mostly comical and unbelievable, yet it expects you to take their plights seriously. The grim tale of fighting the inevitable that begins around the midway point is predicated on half a series of the main characters engaging in the kind of stupid and thoughtless behavior that is only acceptable within the context of comedy.
It operates on a kind of dating sim logic where almost all the pivotal characters (themselves shallow dating
                  sim cutouts too; there's the airheaded childhood friend, the redheaded tsundere, the catgirl maid, etcetera) of the story (the scale of which extends far beyond Akihabara where the events of the anime take place) just happen to be teenage girls living within the vicinity of the protagonist, no matter how unlikely. That one of them happens to be the one of the most brilliant researchers in the field of time travel is only the most egregious example I can bring up without getting into spoiler territory.
The opening's good, though.",3

-	John Titor (Steins;Gate)
At the time of this writing Steins;Gate is at a well deserving #2 of all
                  animes rated on MAL. It will forever and ever remain as one the greatest animes I have had the pleasure of watching. It had sci-fi, mystery, thriller, comedy and romance meshed in such a way to make one amazingly well-written, well-presented, and thrilling story. This anime had me thinking for months and I am writing this (belatedly late) review in the hope of convincing some of you to pick up this gem of an anime.
As you all have probably heard Steins;Gate is an anime about time travel, a fiendishly difficult concept to make work in any sci-fi media and it would be no surprise if Steins;Gate failed just because of  this subject material. However Steins;Gate is a refreshing departure from other media of the genre by being not only exceedingly well researched but deftly managing a complicated non-linear plot with a focussed desired ending.
	One of the main concerns that many people have with watching the anime was the slow and confusing beginning. I would like to address this first. First of all, I as well as many others was very confused with the first couple of episodes. By episode 6 however, I was hooked, and we got hints as the episodes went on that there was some underlying truth to the madness that was episode 1. Having watched the ending I have done a 180 and laud it as one of the best openings to an anime I have ever seen. Pay attention, rewatch the 1st episode if you have to and hopefully by the ending you will come to see what I mean.
By far, Steins;Gate greatest strength lay in its exceptionally well-written plot. Not only did it go into detail about the science behind the time machine, but it managed to incorporate in real world events such as the Y2K problem, John Titor, CERN, the Butterfly effect and many other recognisable real world phenomena. Steins;Gate makes use of a variety of scientific disciplines from Physics to Neuroscience to Game Theory in an astounding effort  to create a believable theory behind the time machines. While there are inconsistencies and small things that were explained better in the VN, the science fiction is good enough to throw aside any doubts and just enjoy the damn anime! 
I found the opening ‚ÄúHacking to the Gate,‚Äù annoying at first as it did little to alleviate the confusion from the first episodes. By the second half I found it addictive and it easily became one of my favourite openings. The soundtrack was another highlight of the show. The producers did an amazing job of combining the lighting, soundtrack and animation to convey some of the more emotion and exhilarating parts of the anime. The art was clean and right where we would expect a top tier class anime to be. It is so good that there is little to be said about it to be honest.
There were a few semi-weak points of the anime: the confusing start for first time viewers for one. I can agree that the first episode did a poor job of introducing new viewers to the show. After episode 5 or so pieces of the storyline start to fit together. All of this sets up nicely for the fast-paced thriller 2nd half where Steins;Gate secured it‚Äôs spot as one of the top animes. Another semi-weak point was the characters. While Steins;Gate featured a wide and varied cast there were characters I found were sidelined/useless and made little impact to the story. The female characters tended to be focussed on one at a time and were absent during the many other episodes. However, they did provide refreshing light hearted comedy during the first half which is more slice of life while the second half dealt with the mystery and thriller. 
For me a show can become unwatchable if the protagonist is horrible. Luckily Steins;Gate gifts us with a most original and enjoyable male protagonist Okabe Rintar... I mean HOOUIN KYOUMA! Although his delusional personality allowed him to expertly show us how NOT to use a time machine he showed a more serious side he would require both sides in his journey through time. Okabe Rintar‚Ä¶ Hoouin Kyouma was a perfect protagonist in an anime depicting a human crusade through time as he rebels against god and fate.
Overall the anime was amazing, the art, the animation, the sound, the characters, everything was well done. Everything was meshed together very well, even the weak points viewed from a different light were arguably Steins;Gate‚Äôs strengths. The interaction between the characters was good fun for the first 12 episodes. But by far what took the cake was the superb story. If I managed to convince someone to watch Steins;Gate and bask in the radiance of this gem with this review, this would have been completely worth it.
‚ÄúAnd I was the one who named the target ___________ Steins;Gate. You [would] know why I named it that.‚Äù",10

                **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
Steins;Gate is not a perfect anime, but hey, NOTHING is perfect. However, it is as close to perfect as any anime has ever gotten. This anime absolutely blew me away.
Story: 10/10
Writing a good story about time travel is hard; really hard in fact. The risk of over-saturation of exposition, plot holes, contradicting real-life science, paradoxes, and lacking understanding of the concept yourself is very high and it only takes one thing to wrong before the entire plot collapses on itself. Steins;gate is a rare example of time travel done right.
Okabe Rintarou is an incredibly intelligent self-proclaimed ""mad-scientist"" who is paranoid about absolutely everything.
                  He is convinced that ""The Organization"" is watching his every move and that everything is a conspiracy. He goes by the allius Houin Kyouma simply because he hates his name and wanted one that sounded more evil. He runs a lab out of his apartment with his only two friends (with the exception of Ferris,I suppose) which he calls the ""Future Gadget Lab."" Their latest project? Create a functioning time machine. One day, Okabe witnesses a murder when attending a scientific seminar about time travel, and sends a text to his friend Daru. As he presses the send button, Okabe's environment suddenly and completely changes. The crowd of people that had gathered in wake of the murder instantaneously disappear, Okabe's friends have memories of that very same day that differ from his, and the woman who Okabe saw was dead on the floor is now alive again. What exactly just happened to Okabe? Watch to find out (This initial arc is only the the beginning of a much, much more complex plot that can't be explained without spoilers).
Long story short, this is the best story-line in any anime I've ever seen. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you gasp, and it  makes you cheer. It explores real-world theories of time travel like string theory and the butterfly effect all in a very coherent, very well executed manner.
The only legitimate complaint that can be made about Steins;gate's story is that it gets off to reasonably slow start. The first 3-4 episodes are all dedicated to exposition and character development and it takes a few episodes for the real plot to kick off. In fact, the plot doesn't really become the masterpiece that it is until the end of the 12TH EPISODE! That's not to say the first 12 episodes are bad by any means, but they certainly aren't half as entertaining as the last 12. If they were, however, I would give the plot an 11/10 with a completely straight face, because when the story-line gets going, oh boy does it get going.
Art: 9/10
The animation in Steins;gate is fluid when it needs to be, stylized when it needs to be, and is always pleasant to look at. I reserve 10/10 ratings for anime with absolutely breathtaking animation, which Stein;gate doesn't quite have, but it is still some very quality art.
Sound: 10/10
Songs are appropriately and expertly utilized throughout the anime, not to mention that Steins;Gate has one of the catchiest openings ever. It's hard to get out of your head. The real reason that sound gets 10/10 here though is the stellar voice acting. Both the subbed and dubbed versions are FANTASTIC. I challenge someone to point me in the direction of a better dub OR a better sub. Giving sound anything but a 10/10 is unthinkable for Steins;Gate.
Characters: 9/10
Some people criticize the character setup of Steins;Gate, claiming that Okabe is the only dynamic character and the only character who actually changes throughout the show. Well, people who criticize that aspect of Steins;Gate need to be reminded that this a show about time travel; Okabe is the only one who is time traveling and therefore he is the only character it makes sense to change. All of the dramatic and life-changing experiences that Okabe remembers are forgotten by everyone else after Okabe time travels, so how could any other character be dynamic? Additionally, a character doesn't necessarily have to be dynamic to be a good character, as evidenced by the characters in Steins;Gate. There are a ton of unique, interesting, and well-developed characters that are worth talking about in this show, but I'm going to stick to the 4 main members of the lab for the sake of simplicity.
Okabe, of course, is the protagonist and the best character in the anime. His alter ego, Houin Kyouma, can get annoying at times, but that doesn't stop him from being an incredibility likable character. Despite his brash exterior, he is a genuinely good person with admirable motives to everything he does, even if that's not what he says out loud. He is very concerned with other people and is willing to help others through tough times anyway he can. Watching Okabe go through all the hardships he ends up having to face is one of the best parts of the anime; you genuinely feel bad for the poor guy. Okabe is funny, relateable, and overall a fantastic protagonist.
Makise Kurisu is Okabe's intellectual equal. She is a scientist from America who takes interest in the Future Gadget Lab when she learns that they are attempting to build a time machine. Her chemistry with Okabe and the other characters (but especially Okabe) is very fun to watch. Much like Okabe, she is brash and blunt on the outside, but is actually very thoughtful and compassionate on the inside. She is the second most important character because she is the one who is always helping out Okabe when he gets in way over his head with all the time travel related catastrophes. The evolution of the relationship between Okabe and Kurisu ends up being one of the most redeeming qualities of the show. Again, Kurisu is yet another fantastic character.
The fan base becomes a little more divisive when it comes to the next two characters; Mayuri and Daru. Mayuri is Okabe's childhood friend; Okabe is very protective of her and cares about her more then he cares about anyone else in the world. Mayuri is one of the nicest, most adorable, most uplifting characters you will ever see. A lot of people think she is annoying, but I don't think so at all. Daru is the lab's technical genius. He is a stereotypical nerd character, always making perverted jokes and making references to his hentai games. I'm not crazy about Daru, but he has his moments.
The reason the characters in Steins;Gate work so well is because they have such incredible chemistry with each other. They function so well as a unit that their individual flaws can be easily overlooked. People who criticize Steins;Gate's characters really need to think about the circumstances of the show more.
Overall: 10/10
This is the only anime I've ever watched that I give a 10/10. Everything is so well executed, so well thought out, and so entertaining. This anime has action, suspense, mystery, plot twists, drama, romance, hell it has just about everything you can ask for out of a TV show. If you haven't seen this show, SEE IT! It is an absolute masterpiece. And yes, I know the first few episodes are slow, that is the only legitimate complaint I have.

                What would you do if you had the chance to travel in time??
I'm pretty sure there's a lot of different answers to that, depending on the person. But there's always a particular thing that most people would do: ""To fix a certain event of my life I'm regretting until now"", or something like that. As life moves on and on, the decisions that we've made always have consequences that we may or may not have seen. Action-reaction patterns have always been a part of what makes reality to be possible. Time and Space are always built on our actions.
Before starting how about laying out the
                  following paradox to ourselves:
Say, you want to go back to the past, and tell your past-self that if you do ""X"", terrible things will happen. It turns out that your past self agrees, and you can go back to the future in peace. Here's the most logical outcome: The reason that you went to the past for, isn't there anymore, and therefore, your mind should not have memories of going into the past for X not to happen. We are now in a different timeline.
If this concept makes you curious, you will absolutely love Steins;Gate.
The story follows an excentric, self-proclaimed mad scientist, whose lifetime dream has always been the possibility to travel in time at will. Just out of curiosity, he devotedly investigates all the steps to be followed, as if he was in some sort of a game. When he finds out that it can be done, and it's easier than what he ever thought of, he starts experimenting with all of the possible outcomes, changing the past, and thus, the world he has always lived in. The story also has a certain tragedy approach, as it tackles the topis of frustration, efforts that seem vain and people regretting their own lives and actions.
Steins;Gate has a particular hook that you may see in many animes that have some sort of psychological or thriller approach, building questions and curiosity whenever it has the chance. Due to this, the series feels the need to take its time, and the pacing at the starting episodes feels really slow.
Although the pace of the first episodes made it seem quite boring, it progressively got better as it advanced. Time travel has always intrigued me, and in this anime, it was all over the place. It was a really amusing and satisfying watch.
Overall, Steins;Gate is one of the best anime out there. It has everything a sci-fi lover would ask. And more.",10
"
                Throughout history of pop culture, there are many examples of classic time travel stories in various forms of media and narrative approach. Does Steins;Gate, a much-loved show by contemporary anime fans, have what it takes to join this hallowed ranks and become the medium's definitive representation of the particular sub-genre?
Short answer: no. 
Long answer:
Following self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintaro Okabe and his quirky band of lab mates (i.e. a harem of girls and a perverted otaku), Steins;Gate initially revolves around the idea that the characters can send text messages to the past through microwave oven. Now, credit where it's due: ""send text messages to the past
                  through microwave oven"" is a pretty awesome conceptual hook, and immediately engaged my interest once I've had the show described to me as such. However, eventually I found that the pacing is a bit of a mess (it's way too slow in the first half and way too hectic in the second half), it doesn't do anything remarkably interesting in terms of visual/audio presentation, and despite the instantly intriguing premise, the execution leaves much to be desired. 
First thing to note is that S;G is the furthest thing from hard science fiction, despite what the awkwardly-placed techno-babble might want you to believe. Through its main character, the show repeatedly declare that science is an important process of it, and yet I hardly see an actual example of scientific process/mindset being shown (*no, building a time machine with surprising ease and spouting convoluted time travel theories don't really count). Okabe is much less an actual scientist and more of a poser who slums around in otaku-friendly lifestyle with complete disregard to real life responsibilities, while the show occasionally reverted into rather impressive leaps of logic and demonstration of absurd causality. 
But really, at its heart S;G is a character-driven show with significant dashes of romance and comedy. It's also very much in spirit with its visual novel origin; a genre frequently characterized by individual bonding scenes between its main character and a gaggle of supporting characters, often through slice-of-life manner. That's definitely not problem in itself as I always valued a story that used high concept primarily to amplify its humane elements, but let's be honest, the setting and characters in this show is clearly catered to certain audience demographic in ways that I particularly don't care of. I actually found that the show worked best when it dabbles on mystery/thriller territory, as shown in a chilling early sequence where the group stumbled upon horrific imagery of future time travel experiment, but this tone is rarely used and SERN, the obligatory Evil Organization often found in this kind of story,  doesn't amount much more than a vague antagonistic force and a plot device. The romantic/comedic parts, while not being severely aggravating or offensive, aren't really that well-executed, as it used tiresome and stereotypical character tics way too often (yes, I got that Daru likes to make dirty comments and Kurisu likes to blush furiously whenever Okabe says something that's even mildly appreciative of her, thank you very much for incessantly reminding me of that, show).  
On a more positive note, the show does end in a rather satisfying resolution (you can argue that it cheated around its own rules in order to get the kind of ending it wanted, but consistency and holeproof plot aren't something I expect from even the best time travel story), as it contextualized and explained what is otherwise an incomprehensible beginning. And while most of the characters' design/interaction/behavior still felt off to me, one does grow on me throughout: Okabe's childhood friend Shiina Mayuri, a more complex and sympathetic character than initial impression, and whose inner conflict I found to be much more believable than practically the rest of the cast. 
So yeah, many things in Steins;Gate didn't work out very well for me and I'll continue to be baffled by the immense love it received by certain subset of fans. It doesn't feel like a complete waste of time though, as it's an adequate and perfectly accessible time travel entertainment as long as you're not actively looking for plot holes in its faux-scientific plot and/or severely allergic to some bad tropes on display here.",6

                Undoubtedly, one of the best anime this year and all time. One of the few that makes the viewers actively thinking.
A ""mad scientist"" with his ""hostage"" went to a conference and saw a dead woman. Trying to send a message after being shocked of what he saw, he suddenly finds himself back in an altered time!
WTF just happened!!!!
What do you get when you try to merge sci-fi, mystery and thriller? You get a complicated plot, not to mention it also got drama,action, comedy and romance and it's all about time travel! But that's a no problem for Steins;Gate and it masterfully portrayed it, some of
                  the few that made it.
Although it gets all my praise for being a masterpiece, it still has its downsides. The story, as it goes, slowly loses its complexity and becomes more and more predictable but that didn't make the series lose its spices, it was still very exciting, heartbreaking, tear-jerking, and thrilling till the last second. I just can't stop watching it from the first episode, a day passed by me quickly, as if the show itself was a time machine!(10)
Art was above average. The style was addicting.(BTW I haven't read yet the VN so I can't compare the visual style bet. the two)The background was splendid. Animation is very fluid, no complaints and at some point extremely excellent. Character design was beautiful and cute      ( Nyan!), +very  for Kurisu(Chris). Lighting, hmm, most of the time is good but sometimes its just dull-it was overdone.(8)
BG music's quite few but played perfectly in key parts, greatly added the depth of current atmosphere in the show(loved at mystery spoofs! creepy!), it didn't redirected the viewer's understanding what is currently happening(is this a mystery?/WTH just happened!). Subtly playing in right times and most of the times none, this actually helped amplify it when it's played, like the silence before the storm, though in some sense this is also its downfall, not enough flavor was distributed throughout in some episodes just to make the others extra spicy.
Voice acting, superb! Well you got the some of the best in the industry like Miyano and Hanazawa(two of my fav seiyuus)though not as famous as the others, I loved Imai's performance and she did it perfectly.(9)
No stupid cliches overdone to the point of annoyment, no psychos and retards(Moeka is debatable)as most of their actions are justified and are perfect image of human nature-in anime world. Development went as swimmingly as possible though seems to be lacking in depth except for our main protagonist and heroine, well its a lot better than most 24 eps series out there although not the best. It's good enough for you not to have difficult time understanding them hence leaving no loose ends and misunderstandings.(sorry but this is the best I could say about characters without spoiling too much). (9)
Only few anime has given me this enjoyment. Enjoyment of having a  great time experiencing all kinds of emotions in one show, enjoyment of a good ending, enjoyment of finding out that a good anime can still exist and didn't extinct. (10)
Overall, ""in my opinion"", it is one the best anime I've ever watched. Why? Because even though it is not the best  in the sci-fi and thriller it is one of the few which actually manage to merge it with romance and drama splendidly. I am truly glad to have watched this series and I hope you find this review compelling enough to make you curious and watch the anime for those who haven't yet and for those who have change their opinion, just a little bit, about the anime, because it's  a one of a kind.
P.S. my first review made at 3 am and is edited once.",10

                [I really need to rewrite this review because I don't agree with what I wrote but I'm keeping it up for now]
I have to start off by saying that initially I gave this anime a 9 out of 10. However, as time passed I realized that there was no reason for me to give it a 9 over a 10. Normally with things I score a 9, there was something about it that prevented me giving it a 10. Such as, the ending was unsatisfying, the plot too confusing, too much fanservice, etc. etc. But with Steins;Gate there was literally nothing. 
Some complaints that could
                  be used against Steins;Gate is that the first half of the show was really slow. However, I was hooked from quite literally the first second of the show. As soon as I heard the opening quote I was like ""dayum"" and immediately proceeded to marathon the entire thing. But I have heard from others that the first half was hard to get through. The thing about the first half of the show is that it sets the plot up like dominoes to topple over and then completely destroy and annihilate with an atomic bomb in the second half. This is not your typical time-travel anime. I pretty much spent the entire second half of the show crying and yelling THIS IS EFFED UP to my friend who had already seen it.
Now on to the actual review:
Story: 10/10
As I explained above, the first half sets up the second half. In addition, there are many story elements that are only partially explained at first (i.e. what Steins;Gate refers to), leaving you guessing until the very end when they explain what everything is. Then you're sitting there in a daze going ""OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" for about fifteen minutes. The show's theories about and behind time travel are also very well explained, so there aren't plot holes to be found there. In addition, if you had any lingering questions or regrets, the OVA/special wraps things up very nicely. Overall, the story was absolutely fantastic and still blows my mind away.
Art: 10/10
Apparently Steins;Gate was really low-budget, but I'm not too convinced myself since the art was very pretty and pleasing to the eye. They stuck to the style of the visual novel and did a good job keeping everything focused where it should have been all along: on the story and characters. There weren't battle sequences where you get to see how well animated it really is, but Steins;Gate centers around the plot, not so much the action.
Sound: 9/10
The only reason this isn't getting a 10 is because for the most part, there was a lack of background music. However, that wasn't really a problem for me because the story was so engaging without it. But when background music is playing, and then it stops, you know it's about to get real.
As far as songs go, the opening song, ""Hacking to the Gate,"" and the ending song, ""Butterfly,"" are both really great songs too and fit the theme of the show. The opening song's lyrics actually have a ton of foreshadowing if you go back and look at them later, and the ending song is pretty much my trigger because I'd be sitting there in shock after an episode, the ending song would start rolling, and I'd start crying.
Another thing about sound is that since this takes place in the summer, there was a pretty much constant buzz of cicadas. Since that sound was omnipresent through the whole show, whenever I now hear the sound of cicadas I immediately get reminded of Steins;Gate.
Character: 10/10
The cast of characters was so diverse in this show. All of their personalities resonated really well with each other. You have Rintarou affecionately calling Mayuri his hostage and also walking around like he's the king, only to get reminded that he is only, in fact, 18. Then there's his dynamic with Kurisu (who he calls Christina because he is quite literally the biggest dork ever), where she dislikes his bossy personality and makes it a point to argue with him as much as possible. Indeed, she does establish her dominance over him from time to time. Namely, a scene where she was teaching him to speak nicely to her and use her correct name by repeatedly hanging up on him until he got the hint. In addition, Mayuri and Kurisu have a wonderful friendship with each other, and Kurisu gets really protective of Mayuri because she thinks that Rintarou and Daru are perverts (Daru yes, Rintarou not so much).
Also, Daru's vocabulary basically consists of old Internet memes and the like, and Kurisu knows what they all mean despite her consistent refusal to admit that she does. There was an especially golden moment when she and Rintarou were arguing and Daru said ""They are the OTP in the fanfic I call my life."" Kurisu immediately burst out, ""We are not OTP!"" and then Rintarou and Daru were making fun of how familiar she was with the lingo despite her claims that she is not around the online community that much. That fools no one though. We all know she knows as much as Daru. 
This show also brought one of my biggest ships around here too. It's confusing at first, because there are two main female characters and one main male character, but both of them are not love interests. Let's be honest, if this was Sword Art Online, both of them would be nuts for Rintarou, but that isn't the case. The romance is subtle and develops slowly and quietly throughout the show.
Then there's the character Suzuha, who seems to dislike Kurisu for some reason. I'm going to avoid talking about her for the most part, but her role in the story is very important.
There is a lack of character development in the show, but not for the reasons you might think. It's actually a huge part of the story, but I'm going to leave it at that because of spoilers.
I watched Steins;Gate dubbed, and I thought the dub cast did an outstanding job of reflecting each character's personality. J Michael Tatum was spot on as Rintarou, and my favorite role of Trina Nishimura is Kurisu (though Mikasa is a close second). Both of them nailed their characters and they did such a great job with their acting. According to my friend, the actors mentioned in panels that they kept crying while recording and J Michael Tatum had a mental breakdown while recording an episode, but they kept it because it matched the lip flaps. The fact that the characters were crying while recording shows that they really got into their roles and felt an emotional connection to their characters.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Some people might argue that the first half was hard to get through, but speaking from personal experience as someone who marathoned the show in two days, it was not. I keep explaining that the first half of the show sets up the pain and heartbreak for the second half.
In addition, Steins;Gate does a great job of referencing pop culture. They reference Doctor Who several times, and the text messages they send into the past they decide to call D-mail, short for DeLorean mail, which is obviously a Back to the Future reference. Then there's the bit about OTPs and fanfics, and tons of other references made left and right.
Steins;Gate was engaging the whole way through and just generally had a lot of crying alone in the dark in front of my computer while I pressed next episode and sobbed a lot. As heartbreaking and painful as it was, it was such a good show, and I'd love to erase my memories and watch it again, and get drawn in by it again.
Overall: 10/10
This show definitely made it into my top 5 animes of all time. Unfortunately, it can't move up much farther from there, just because my top 5 animes were all so amazing. That being said, it definitely does not suck, and you just have to watch it to experience it for yourself. There's only so much explaining I can do.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is an anime that might be recommended to you when you begin your anime journey. It's listed genres are Science Fiction, and Thriller. It sits with other heavyweights, like Full Metal Alchemist, Death Note, Bebop, Monster and Natsume.  On MAL, this anime has a ridiculously high rating. Was I excited? For sure. Not just because of its rating but also because it's genre is sci-fi and it deals with time travel. Ever since watching Lost in 05, and catching a few docs on the Discovery Channel, I've become a bit of a sucker for all things sci-fi and time travel. Now, if Steins;Gate
                  combined the clever writing and plot in Death Note with science fiction elements, then, we'd have a winner! However, there are a couple of gripes I had with characterisation and story that really lowered my overall enjoyment of the series. 
Steins;Gate did not do a good job with the science-fiction aspect of the show. I felt that not enough respect was given to time travel; and I'm not being pedantic. It doesn't have to be factually accurate, it just has to be somewhat plausible (I mean, the Da Vinci Code is completely fiction, but it feels 'right' as in this could actually happen). The 'science-fiction' in Steins;Gate was a really disappointing aspect. The concept of time travel was watered down and did not feel 'plausible' enough, so much so that in the first occurrence of time travel, I really thought when the characters where explaining how the message had gone back in time, they were having an inside joke that was lost in translation.
   Time travel. It has drawn the attention of the greatest minds of our times - Einstein, Novikov, Friedman, Hawking, Thorne, Nahin etc. It forms the bridge between time and present. In that everyone has shared a moment in which we think about time, and how we need more, or we wished that we could do it all again, is absolute. Time travel is so alluring because it makes one the master of time. And to master time is to master the poison that must take us all. To master time, to conquer the final, known, dimension. And we always need time. We need more time with our loved ones. Less at work. We need to correct mistakes. Go back in time. Wish we could. And all this is against the age old adage that time is the one thing that man cannot master. It is the one, intangible, thing, concept, that binds, everyone. And to whom everyone obeys. And that's why we always accept time's rules and yet we are infinitely interested in what if's, in time travel.
   The simple truth is that to travel back in time is impossible. It is impossible in that it breaks the fundamental law of our constructed universe - that nothing, without exception, travels faster than light. We have already built man made chambers that accelerate charged particles to very near the speed of light, however the hopes of our greatest scientists in developing these gargantuan machines was never to travel faster than light, but, in the case of synchrotron, study the radiation given off by the particles as they accelerate, or recreate particles such as the Higgs boson particle, and answer the fundamental questions in physics. The only form of time travel that humans can conceptualise at the moment is time dilation, or travelling through time. To do this? The most reasonable ideas put forth are travelling through a worm hole or orbiting a black hole. To understand why these are the most reasonable ideas, is to understand that to travel in time is to approach the speed of light. Approaching the speed of light is a frightening concept - the physics formulas you encountered in high school: E=MC^2 and Ek=1/2mv^2 break down as mass itself, which we assume to be constant, actually changes at such velocities. Believe it or not, we have already time travelled on Earth. As the charged particles in particle accelerators near light speed, they are actually travelling in time. The equivalent for a human would need a lot of energy. Hence the 'reasonable theories.' If we could, like a satellite, fall into orbit around a black hole, and therefore harness the incredible energies of a black hole, by constantly falling towards the black hole at a rate that equals our rotation around it (this is how the moon, a satellite, works) than we could approach the speed of light. At this point, time dilation occurs. Time dilation is the idea that relative to another coordinate in space, time is moving at a greater rate. The humans orbiting the black hole in a space ship, are moving through time, at a relatively faster rate, than an observer away from the space ship. Time travel is a relative process. It requires energies that we cannot supply, in quantities that we cannot comprehend. 10 years on board the space ship, and, if they broke away from the black holes orbit and met with the observer, to the observer, 13 years might have passed. The people on board would have travelled in time. 
   All this is speculation off course, and this is what I recall from various sources [and being a science fiction doco geek]. I hope this explains why I found the time travel in Steins;Gate so disappointing - the concept is dealt with too easily. I found it a little cheap that they could call this a science fiction series, and then explain time travel as a random occurrence with a wannabe scientist and computer hacker who modded microwave, and the lights going out. The time travel in Steins;Gate is only there as a plot device, a crux. It is not treated as a science fiction element. This in itself is fine (I guess...), except for the pot-holed plot. Cue next section:
Not going to go into many details of the story/plot, as per the guidelines. The story is not paced well. There are about six episodes at the beginning where there is no story progression. However, after these episodes there is a definite increase in pace. One of my dislikes in using time travel as a plot device where the leaps of faith the show asked you to take. How many 'timelines' are there? How can you change the past (send a message) and then undo the messages. Would not the existence of the messages themselves have some type of ripple effect? If you go back in time, are you rewriting a timeline, or creating a new timeline from that point. How did that machine work across timelines - would it not have been reset when they went back in time.
   *Spoilers*Also, a lot of the second half takes place within an extremely short time frame. Off course with the help of the time machine, this short time frame is stretched to, well, half the season. So, how can there be any character development when the only character with knowledge of his past experiences is Okabe. Other character's can't develop as they are constantly reset, again and again. If they do remember a different timeline, than this is not science fiction, this is just another crux/plot device that is being used to allow character development to happen when there is none. I guess that's why I found the love story between the leads really unnecessary and just not believable. If you look at the actual time frame, and not just how many times Okabe's travelled to the past, there's like, what, a couple days max for Kurisu and Okabe to form this 'you are the one' love. Yeah, no. Also the ending, it's another deus ex machina - and an extremely anti-climatic one. We already know what needs to happen. And therefore, we already know how Okabe will save Kurisu. Even before the actual thing. So when it actually plays out, you already have the knowledge, like someone gave you a spoiler, that Kurisu survives somehow. You may not know how exactly, but you know what ultimately happens. This leads to a very anticlimatic ending where we already know what happens.
Steins;Gate was an interesting watch. For me, this anime let me down with how it dealt its science fiction elements, and its plot which I found weak (the deus ex machina, and the sudden romance). While I don't necessarily think Steins;Gate is bad, I do think it's over rated. In my review, I didn't mention the positives. These where that the concept was interesting, and the story, albeit a few gripes, is good, and refreshing from the usual anime genres. The idea of what a 'Steins;Gate' was, was good, and left a good 'you can do anything!' feeling. While I definitely think it's worth a watch, I can only rate it a 6/10 due to my own unfounded expectations, and gripes which I feel really detract from the whole experience.",6
"
                Steins ; Gate is the anime equivalent of most mainstream action movies, watered-down content-less drivel completely devoid of artistic value aimed at mass consumption. It checks every box that people use in order judge anime in order to avoid criticism, which in turn makes its massive fanbase gang up on anyone with a dissenting opinion feeling as if they defend the theory of relativity when someone complains about Einstein based on his hairstyle. That being said, I don't restrain myself by only giving low scores to teenage power fantasies where the screentime is equally divided between pantyshots, infodumping and incohohrent yelling, instead I will judge
                  an anime equally harsh for being devoid of what makes one want to watch anime, namely artistic value or even some good old plain fun.
With that metric, Steins ; Gate is complete garbage. It's as bad as commonly ranted upon works like ""There's no way my little sister can be this cute"" or studio Deen's seemingly inexistant Fate/Stay Night adaption. It's arguably even worse than the latter, because in the midst of Shirou's cringeworthy attempts at philosophy and out-of-place romance development it at least presents a concept that has the potential of being fun as well as moving with a pace where I still feel like things are happening, even if it's nowhere near a Ron Paul level. And hey, I like the soundtrack and the magic school setting still evokes chuunibyou feelings in me even if I should be way too old for that.
Steins ; Gate on the flipside moves at the pace of a sludge metal album, except the heavy atmosphere ir replaced by the soullessness of prog. This would be fine if it at least were an atmospheric experience akin to something like Texhnolyze or had the character development of .hack//Sign resulting in great payoffs near the end but instead we have a plot that challenges Wonderwall for the prize of the most mundane piece of media ever created, only coated with  sci-fi elements as a lazy way of attempting to emulate flavor. It suffers the same flaw as almost all visual media (thank Yuasa for Tatami Galaxy) where you can't go in your own pace, thus having to wait from the time your brain registers what's happening onscreen and something new happens, except in Steins ; Gate the process lasts several episodes rather than just a few seconds.
This is of course, after the well-defended first half of the show which supposedly exists so the audience can get attached to the characters. The fatal problem with the first half is that Steins ; Gate never manages to make the characters shine more brightly than the cast of Die Hard & co, (at least here the main character isn't Mamoru Miyamo portrayed by Mamoru Miyamo) with the only bright spot being everyone's favorite mad scientist who breathes a much needed bit of life into what otherwise would be as monotone as waiting for the dentist (instead becomes as monotone as waiting for the doctor, but hey, you take what you get). The rest of the characters are the anime are the personifications of white bread and fail to make an impression further than the stereotype they are presented as. It's fine to have stereotypical characters, but in order for me to feel empathy towards them they need to feel like characters and Steins ; Gate never manages this. Sure, Okabe is Okabe but Daru for example is the fat nerd, and the nerd isn't a character until he is further developed or presented in an original way, of which neither is true here.
After you've forced yourself through the first half, the plot finally thickens and for a while Steins ; Gate suddenly seems promising again. The progression is very natural and for once I could feel excited about what I was watching. I felt like the show was going somewhere, that I would finally see the light every Steins ; Gate enthusiast had seen, but alas, I would soon be very disappointed as the show soon would readjust itself into its old pacing the way an alcohol junkie somehow finds his way to another bottle after a few white days, and shrinks back into the darkness with even lesser hope of a bright future.
So Steins ; Gate ends, in the same darkness it belonged to during the first half, after spending its second half dragging out a plot that should've been the length of a feature film. Heck, if it was only that long maybe I would've liked it the same way I like something like Back to the Future, while the knowledge in the back of my head that it's not really that good, but the charm of it makes me look past that as I shut down my brain for an hour and half and just enjoy the ride.
Let me just clarify one last thing, Steins ; Gate is very polished. While it's profoundly uninteresting due to being thinned out like homeopathic medicine, there's not that many glaring issues with it unlike something like Sword Art Online where there are countless of hour-long videos dedicated to point out issues in it (that somehow ends up being more boring than the show itself, damn you Digibro for green lightning this as the gold standard of anime reviewing). This extends to the audiovisuals as well. They're not particularly artistic, but they certainly both look and sound good throughout Steins ; Gate with nothing to take issue to, like any decent feature film.
If you're new to storytelling regardless of medium, you might find Steins ; Gate fascinating the same way the indigenous people of the Amazon would find vanilla ice cream fascinating, but I fail to see why the rest of this site hold Steins ; Gate in such high regard. It's a monotone and predictable experience with a dull character cast and the pacing of a sloth trying to cross the highway. Maybe if I enjoyed mainstream movies more I could see the appeal, but to be honest, the only value something like 2012 has over this is that it's shorter in duration, and while it doesn't make it any better, it certainly makes it more tolerable.
Now if you excuse me I'm going to go watch some Nascar for a while. I need some excitement in my life after this snorefest. Or darts. Darts works too.",4

                Steins Gate starts off pretty slow. It actually takes half a dozen episodes and at some point, I was starting to wonder what all the hype was about. But trust me, your patience will be rewarded. When it finally picks up, it's funny, sad, romantic, and downright nerve racking throughout the rest of the series. Their approach on time machines is a unique one that will have time travel fans thinking twice. 
It was criticized for stuffing so much information in just 24 minutes for the first episode. 
Yet afterwards the show was much more quieter than what the first episode led on and focused
                  on developing our central cast and when we finally hit the halfway mark (episode 12), all hell breaks loose and the show begins its trek to widespread acclaim.
To the production values: The animation wasn't one of the best, but White Fox did a great job in handling this series. It was really high-quality animation for 24 episodes, though there were alot of dark scenes that i couldn't see at all and can‚Äôt understand why they were so dark (censoring? what?) but other than that i have no qualms. The music was very low-key for me: it didn't really start to hit me until the last 5 or so episodes when the really epic stuff came at the viewers at breathtaking speeds.
Speaking of bantering and quipping, when Steins;Gate is in comedy mode, it is comedy indeed; characters set up their own fall with innocent innuendos and ill-thought-out blurbs, while other characters jump at the chance to take the piss at the hapless bumblers each in their own unique way. The series itself displays its recent pedigree by dropping references to other works old and new, and even in-jokes which would be familiar to today‚Äôs Internet denizens. Yet when Steins;Gate is in drama mode, it is also drama indeed; Okabe, experiencing firsthand the consequences of messing around with ‚Äúworldlines‚Äù, is forced to confront hostile forces which threatens the safety of everyone involved with him, and eventually finds himself responsible for the future of the whole world. And even here, some elements of the drama driving the plot are taken right out of real life. Comedy and drama are both used in just the right dose, at the right time, to make the most impact and keep the momentum of the story going.
The key to this has to be the characters. The characters, like the plot, will seem atrocious if I break them down individually: the childish, nonsense spouting but occasionally brilliant Okabe; the fat, perverted but kind-hearted Daru; the Tsunderish genius Makise; ditsy childhood friend Mayuri; the scarily androgynous doormat Ruka; and so on, but that might just be the point. One criticism I‚Äôve heard levied and have some sympathy for is the complaint that Okabe is really annoying. I can see that, he is at the beginning. The thing is‚Ä¶ he changes. They all do. Some shows have their characters defined within minutes and never waver but, as I said before, this isn‚Äôt about the comedy; it isn‚Äôt about the angst or a crazy, mind blowing science fiction world laden neck deep in symbolism. It‚Äôs about a group of friends, alienated from society at large, that make a time machine and how that affects their lives and relationships. What makes this worthwhile though? What makes this strange bunch worth watching over twenty-four episodes? I‚Äôll tell you in one beautiful phrase: damn good writing.
All this does not come without a price though. The gentle build up of characterisation is effective but slow. The first half of the series, while still very entertaining, seems to lack a little bit of direction while it builds up steam. Also Okabe really is embarrassing to watch earlier on in the show especially before he has Makise to call him on it (which happens mercifully quickly) but it really does take the show time to start building his character to a meaningful level and the wait can be a little tiring.
In the end it is a sacrifice that I‚Äôm willing to make. In exchange for a slow build up and an irritating lead I get a pitch perfect turning point and a thrilling climax that must be amongst the most satisfying endings in science-fiction anim√© history if not anim√© in general. We get relationships we can invest in and we get characters that properly progress through beginning, middle and end. It‚Äôs a show that takes us somewhere. It might not be anywhere that deep but it is affecting, fun and deeply enjoyable.",9

                I don't understand why so many people like this anime. It's the Butterfly Effect stretched out for 24 episodes which makes the story weaker and more convoluted.I thought it was extremely predictable and drawn out. I found Mayuri Shiina very annoying. She spent the entire anime acting like my 8 year old niece. Which would have been fine if she was 8. Seeing a grown woman,who isn't mentally challenged, act like a child  is very weird. Some animes I watch all the way thru because I enjoy the characters and the episodic story progression. And some animes I watch all the way thru because
                  I've already invested a certain amount of time and I just want to see it's conclusion. Stiens gate is the latter. This anime was not fun for me at all. The main character who I actually thought was unique and interesting was wasted on this rehashed story. If you're thinking about watching this anime watch the Butterfly Effect first and save yourself 12 hours of repetitive nonsensical story telling.",3
"
                In short, Steins;Gate is an interesting time-travel story with many plot twists and enjoyable characters. That being said, it doesn't mean everyone is going to like it. If you like Sci-Fi series and you aren't obsessed with just one, watch it and you will probably like. It's kind of a brave anime that includes some risky stuff to include in a commercial product like this.
For those who haven't watched the series yet, I'll try to explain what to expect:
* It isn't the best comedy series around.
* It isn't something action packed.
* It isn't about serious science.
* It requires you to be patient, you will probably
                  understand nothing in the first six episodes.
* It isn't something godly nor is it the best thing in existence.
* If you are obsessive with old school anime (retard in short with my saying), you better not watch it.
So what's so good about it? Why is it rated that highly in almost every anime (and even VN) platform?
It's a very solid mixture of comedy, sci-fi and thriller genres. Twist after twist. It's unique and remarkable. It's done the right way :)
Story
This is the best part of all. Weird things happen in this anime, but they all make sense somehow. It has an amazing story, everything is connected somehow and not even a small part of it is ruined. The story progression is somewhat ""accelerated"". It starts slowly and gets faster by each episode. People looking for action will probably find the first episodes boring. Try to be patient until you cross ""the borderline"" or just drop it. I won't say what that borderline is, you better not get spoiled.
Sound
First of all, with all my objectiveness, I must say that the voice acting in this anime is really amazing. Okabe Rintarou is far the best voice acting performance I've ever seen and I'm really congratulating the VA for this.
I enjoyed most of the soundtracks. Mostly, the main theme, Gate of Steiner was awesome, it was both saddening and thrilling.
The opening was one of the best  and the ending was good.
Art
It was good and I liked it. I think it fits the anime. The animation can be fluid at times, but it was better for me for an anime like this.
Character
The series includes one of the most original, funny -and trolling- characters ever made, ""Hououin Kyouma the Mad Scientist"". You will start enjoying the series for real after completely grasping his personality. He's very unique (actually, a bit more unique than he needs to be), trust me.
Of course the series doesn't include only one character (though he was the outstanding one). To be honest, I liked the most important five characters: Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, Daru and Suzuha and I don't really care about the rest.
Enjoyment
It was very enjoying for me. It's not easy to find an anime of this quality. To be honest, it's not the best anime choice for everyone. If you are seeking for something action packed or something like that romance in the school stuff, skip to the next because this is not your kind of deal. 
Overall
It's a good series. Ah, that's not enough. Even though I don't see any anime as perfect, this is the BEST SERIES I'VE EVER WATCHED and deserves its place to the end.

                I'm gonna try and not makes this too long as reviews that are long can be a pain to read and give too much away, but I don't want to make it too short and miss out some of my opinions!! Put simply Steins;Gate is one of the few masterpieces within Anime today! It is genuinely fantastic and if you haven't watched it I recommend you do so immediately!
At first it isn't very entertaining and you will probably be a little confused but once it gets going, wow its a roller-coaster, and a amazing one at that!
Story-10-The story is gripping and you are constantly guessing
                  what is going to happen next! its so in depth and interesting! the concept of time travel is normal boring and constantly the same, but this story was different with their concept of how it all works and how it can be done.
Art-8-The art is very good and the way they display the whites, blacks and greys is fantastic! I have seen a few anime with better art, but the art in this anime is still brilliant.
Sound-10- I watched it dubbed and thought all the voices matched perfectly and the soundtrack is spectacular in my opinion, especially the OP.
Characters-10-The design and personality of ever character is perfect as the are all different in so many ways but they all combine perfectly together! They compliment each other and I don't think there is any way they could of been made better!! they one thing to always keep in mind is their ages as Okabe and Kurisu are both 18, and I think some people think Okabe is older! Makes his relationship with most the main characters seem weird if you forget that!
Enjoyment-10- I don't think I can stress any more how much I enjoyed it as I watched it in a few days and any spare time I had I used watching this anime as it had me wanting to watch it more and more!! 
Overall-10-Masterpiece!!! If you haven't watched it you are definitely missing out on one of the best animes ever to be created!!
I didn't watch it subbed only dubbed so my review is based on the dubbed version!! I did however watch the OVA's subbed and I think the whole impact of the show was the same I think with this anime is more suited to dubbed as the voices suit better! but thats up to you on if you prefer dubbed or subbed!!
I do hope you give this anime a chance as I know you won't regret it!!
Enjoy!!",10

                Steins;Gate has the potential to be a wonderful anime. Despite its minor flaws, it lives up to that potential. Summed up in a sentence? A 24 episode series with a lot of action, inventive tech, otaku babble, and unique characters.
I have to profess that I did not understand this show for at least half of its running. Then again, I didn't really follow Chaos;Head either. But the English dub of Steins;Gate is superb and I really recommend checking it out. Why?
STORY: I have to admit. Halfway through the series I was lost. I didn't understand the importance between a lot of things in the series.
                  I also wasn't a fan of how the show ran very, very much like an eroge. I get that it's the point: not only are the characters otaku, but it's originally based on a visual novel. Great. Still, I feel it ruined a bit of the frantic nature of some of the episodes. Like, it starts out great and then has to address someone's arc every few episodes to hit each of Okabe's women's arcs (or good/bad endings as they're referred to in eroge). Like the time traveler's story, or the crazy girl's history, or a date with the trap, or saving the moe cafe girl. Ridiculous stuff that we could have done without. I have to say, though, one thing that got me was the whole switching world lines concept. Why bother, if you're just essentially changing lanes and not actually changing the future? A character brings this up late in the series but it's pretty quickly dropped. So, they have an ideal timeline, but there's still all those other world lines. Doesn't make much sense, to me. I think quite a bit more could have been done with SERN, as well. And there's quite a bit of suspension of disbelief. You need to just say, ""Yeah, okay,"" and nod along with all the techno babble and raionalization even if it differs from every other theory you've heard (or flat out doesn't make sense).
SOUND: Sometimes poor voice acting can really ruin a show, no matter how amazing the premise. This is NOT one of those shows; the complete opposite actually. I found the sub hard to follow, but the dub is just great. Each VA really fits their roll and the Funimation rework is lovely. I really appreciate when animation companies rework anime into something that is at once loyal to the original version AND brings in new viewers. I think the other shows I've seen that have done the same (altered, but not too much, and normalized for new English speaking viewers) would be Lupin III (red jacket series that is aired on adult swim) and InuYasha. Steins;Gate is the same. I also got a kick out of Okabe referencing Lupin III at one point, when his VA did a voice in one of the Lupin series (as did their downstairs neighbor). It felt like he had switched to a completely different type of world line!
CHARACTER: The characters in this show are unique. They certainly hit a lot of tropes, but manage to stand alone as well. For instance, Okabe is fantastic. He's a self proclaimed mad scientist and speaks in flowery, academic wording. There's Mayuri, the genki girl. In any other world (I'm thinking almost every single Key Visual world) she may serve no tangible purpose. But here she's almost as important as Haruhi Suzumiya in her scope of casual importance. There's the tsundere genius that started all the problems in the first place. There's the chubby, eroge obsessed guy (who also happens to have a great story). There's the quiet but crazy one. This is a cast of great characters. Okabe quickly gains a harem of women which makes the series feel less like a time traveling delusion (similar to Chaos;Head) and more like an eroge. But the girls are all great. Ok, and the trap is wonderful too. How he's introduced by Okabe in the dub is hilarious. The only misstep here is the hacker who can't open his mouth without spewing a trope or meme, and that's fine. But the show will be heavily timestamped (much like Lupin III in which the characters talk about dated references). Unless, of course, that's the point since the show DOES have a literal time stamp on every episode. In that case: very clever!
ANIMATION: Someone walked in while I was watching this and asked, ""Every time I see this it's just so DARK."" They weren't referring to the tone. The show itself is grungy, dark, and heavily desaturated. I don't understand this trend in anime. I understand it's useful when it pertains to the story, but a lot of the time it really didn't. Still, the character design is unique and nice to watch. 
What I appreciated about the anime was that although it IS based on a ""visual novel"" there was little to no fan service. This show is all about the dialogue, emotions, and ""science."" I highly recommend the English dub.",8
"
                I had a lot of expectation for this since it has such a high rating and is a top 3 anime in myanimelist. I was completely disappointed after watching the show. Many who have watched this said they do not understand the show, but I find it to be easy to understand. For me, the anime itself is not complex but tries to be. 
The concept is good, time-traveling, butterfly effect and it shows that every little things in our life is important. If one were to change something, no matter how small you think it is, it could still affect the future. However, the
                  execution itself is horrible. Uninteresting characters with typical dating sim personalities, art that is not pleasant to the eyes, boring sounds. I seriously do not understand the high ratings that the watcher gave to this anime. I think the novel or manga version of this would be better than the anime.",2

                ""I am the Insane Mad Scientist, Hououin...KYOUMA""
yes, its me ill hopefully be writing a review about steins gate but i really don't want the ORGANIZATION to find out.... El Psy Congroo...
Yoo! mina this will be my first review about the anime i love the most which is steins gate, to start things off steins gate is an anime about time travel and how the""butterfly effect"" can really change everything and cause a time paradox.
Story:
As for the story of steins gate it starts at the summer of 2010 and consists of a group of friends who experiment on different future gadgets in order to change humanity
                  FUWAHAHAHA, anyway they stumble upon their great creation which was phone microwave (name subject to change ofc =P) which helps them send messages to the past and thus begins the long series of unfortunate events. What i liked about the story is that it will always keep you by the edge of your seat, the twists and plots are amazing and that's why i fell in love with the story.
Sound:
I've gotta say, the soundtracks in steins gate are top-notch and very well used in order to convey the scene, as for the opening (Hacking into the gate) its brilliant, Itou Kanako never seems to disappoint me her voice is just amazing. The ending song (Toki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku by Yui Sakakibara) is also such amazing track, and not to mention (Sky Clad no Kansokusha by Itou kanako) which was aired in episode 23.
Characters:
Grab as many seiyuu's and put them together in one anime and what do you get? PERFECTION!
The great thing about steins gate is that it focuses more on character development and to be honest it really did its job.
Enjoyment:
As much as i love re-watching the series over and over again, i absolutely love this anime and could rate it as my number 1! I got hooked to this series so fast that i wish i could go back to the past and watch it for the first time XD.
Overall:
Overall, Steins gate is a must watch series if you are interested in time travel or basically hooked in the ""Thriller"" theme, it has an awesome story, great character's and beautiful sound tracks that just take you away.
Thnx for reading my review, hope you enjoyed it. EL PSY CONGROO.",10

                ""No one knows what the future holds. That's why the potential is infinite."" -- Okabe Rinatoru aka Hououin Kyouma aka The Mad Scientist. 
Humanity has pondered the possibility of time travelling since long, Steins;Gate is the realization of that in anime format. 
Now, time travel is a tricky concept, since it's a phenomenon that humanity is yet to begin to explore. Due to this, whether it be an anime or a movie series, the notion of time travel in its core is succeeded by one fact alone, that is the creativity and what it does with that concept. Steins;Gate is no exception and its success
                  depends on various things it does right. 
The first few episodes give off an awkward feel but once a further episode mark is reached, Steins;Gate is in full flow and every single of that 'convoluted' mess that you thought in the beginning now suddenly starts to make sense, and there is no stopping after that until Steins;Gate is finished. This is where the highlight of the show lies in. Once it has cracked open, it takes the starting episodes to much greater heights all the while making complete sense and not confuse the viewer. Now that I have explained Steins;Gate a little, it still isn't perfect. There is as little a flaw as I can point out while I watched the series, and the story keeps on progressively getting better and the characters are amazing, but on a wider level, Steins;Gate is limited with its characters being limited to serving to the plot alone. 
Okabe Rinatoru is the main protagonist in the show, and the entire story of Steins;Gate revolves around him and his friends or whom he calls as his other Lab Members. On the surface, Okabe can be said to be a nerd who is always preoccupied with fantasy delusions of his regarding time travelling, and calls himself the Mad Scientist and also goes by a different persona namely of Hououin Kyouma. The insight into Okabe's adventure of time travelling carries a great deal of weight, as everything that happens in the show is a direct reaction to his actions. Now him being in the center of everything, the common expectation would be to witness a signification change in personality and ideologies of Okabe over the course of twenty-four episodes, but Steins;Gate defies those expectations. I'd consider this as an achievement in itself for a show such as Steins;Gate which is heavily character-driven, as there is little change in Okabe throughout the show while the enjoyment level never drops down. It would've been a complete success only if Okabe's actions had a motive or reasoning for his actions. It is obvious after a while that Okabe cares about his friends very much and is ready to give his all to try and change their future for the good, but there is no build-up or back-story to his character that it feels just short of the mark. This very much has to do with his childhood friend, Mayuri Shiina, a simple-headed girl that is the second member of Okabe's so called Laboratory that he uses to conduct experiments. Mayuri's fate in the show as it progresses has a big role in Okabe's actions and this leads to the birth of a character so well done even with its share of shortcomings. This is completed with the addition of Makise Kurisu, a genius scientist that in the rush of circumstances becomes a Lab member and joins Okabe, his childhood friend Mayuri, Hashida Itaru, a fat nerdy hacker who also happens to be Okabe's friend and a lab member, who is called as 'Daru' and a self-proclaimed 'Super Hacker'. Several other side characters are revealed with a greater purpose in the show despite being short on characterization. Was this all a move not expected by White Fox at all? Or was it deliberate?
As I mentioned earlier, the concept of time travel is tricky, and one of the main points it has to tackle are character resets. Although Okabe and the other lab members become more familiar with time resets with their progress ahead, the clever pre-requisites that are set before traveling back to time dismiss the possibility of a reset used for conveniences. At other times the reset works perfectly altering the future in that certain time leap behind, while following up for that certain time reset thus again, dismissing it as a convenience. Makise Kurisu acts an important incentive to help with Okabe's time leaps, as she believes what Okabe has to say. This trust is built on the fact that she has a main role to play in the invention of time leaps, thus also expanding her relationship with Okabe Rintarou. All of this co-exists with a very important fact in the whole story. Every time Okabe makes the leap, he remembers all that happens while other do not. He calls this ability ""The Reading Steiner"". The ability, which's origin is unknown is strengthened by the circumstances played out in the time leaps. This carries a huge significance for me personally as Steins;Gate perfects everything it does leaving no plot-holes. A good example is the main character's ability in a similar anime known as ""Erased"". ""Revival"" as he calls it has no explanation to its origins and that leaves a deep plot-hole which cuts the enjoyment of the show in half. Now I don't have any problem with shows which focus on the given plot alone without giving any information to important aspects such as the abilities, but it also needs a co-existing story-line which strengthens its very own existence. Steins;Gate amazed me with this.  
White Fox was a new name to be heard of when Steins;Gate came out, but the art is ever so advanced. The characters with their styles and color palette were overall greatly done. Interestingly, the regular backgrounds and the sceneries were something not hugely emphasized upon. If you have seen Serial Experiments Lain, you'd quickly get what I am talking about. The art in the background is kept minimal while giving full focus to the characters. This works incredibly well with Steins;Gate and creates a sync to how the story unfolds and settles the viewer in quickly. However, the backgrounds also change greatly in sync with the story, which overall gives a great watching experience. There is also a minimal usage of soundtracks in the show, which is exchanged with repeated dialogues so it doesn't feel like a minus at all. ""Hacking to the Gate"" by Kanaka Itou plays as the opening of Steins;Gate. It's overall your typical J-pop but with the regular implementations in the progress of the show, this becomes a treat to the ears every time an episode begins. It's amazing because the song would fit into any of your typical teen-focused anime these days, yet the greatness of Steins;Gate makes the song even more better. I personally didn't pay much heed to the ending as the worst part was when an episode ended and I couldn't wait to go see the next one! But overall, the intro and outro songs depends on preferences. The Japanese dub is always my first choice over its English counterpart and that was the case with Steins;Gate and... Miyano Mamoru does it again! I've lost count of how many characters that he played that I totally cherished. At first, it seems like a bad connection but the 'old-guy' look of Okabe Rintarou and the ever youthful voice of Miyano Mamoru took a good toll on me. Okabe's goofy personality was well presented by him. The rest of the cast was good as well. Hanazawa Kana's voicing as the very simpleton Mayuri was a pleasure throughout the show. 
It was simple curiosity that I gave Steins;Gate a viewing and what an experience it was. Something to cherish for a long time. A show about time traveling is always fun, and I didn't have my own expectations on Steins;Gate beforehand, and that ended as the right mentality for me to go in a watch a show like Steins;Gate... because I didn't need to or wanted to expect anything out of Steins;Gate, but what I got from it was simply great. The 24 episodes were a thrill to watch. As I said earlier before, Steins;Gate isn't perfect. Maybe it could've had emphasized its characters a bit more, but either way it worked out amazingly well. Perhaps the fact alone that Steins;Gate isn't perfect is the biggest reason that makes it a masterpiece. 
Well, that's it from me and I bid farewell as I rephrase ""This is the choice of Steins;Gate!""

                If the enormous amount of almost perfect review scores, the extremely high MAL ranking, or the gushing of people by word of mouth hasn't tipped you off already, you KNOW you should go and watch Steins;Gate already. That said, if you're still not sure for some reason, or you've seen the first couple of episodes and felt dismayed, fear not, I hope this review will clear some of those tricky to enjoy episodes out of the way.
Some people have asked me, who should not watch Steins;Gate? Some people might say that if you don't like sci-fi, comedy, time travel, drama, romance, action, suspense, you should
                  not watch Steins;Gate. I say bullshit. Who doesn't like at least one of those things? With that out of the way, I believe Steins;Gate's target audience is anyone with a brain and interested in ideas typically not shown in popular anime.
STORY (9)
Here's the crux of it. The Story. Steins;Gate is at its heart, a story. That's right Captain Obvious, what else? So then since to give spoilers would destroy the purpose of you watching this show , I will be as discreet as possible. It goes something along the lines of this: You can send text messages to the past. And this will alter the present or the future that the past is linked to. Enter main man Okabe Rintarou and his cast of lab mates. They fiddle around with this time machine, and voila, shit jumps out of the frying pan and into the fire. STOP
That's as much as I'm willing to give you, because here is where you want to read if you're currently stuck on the earlier episodes. GO ON
I admit that Steins;Gate doesn't do itself any favors by introducing things in the deliberate manner you see viewers complain about for the first half of the series. It's true, it's slow, dialogue heavy, still framed, muted colors, weird characters. But hey, look at Bakemonogatari. And Steins;Gate then unfolds like an Agatha Christie mystery, those innocuous details you picked up at the very beginning and disregarded? Congratulations, you're going to get mind blown later on! The nuance of Steins;Gate lies not in rapid dissemination of the plot, nor, like your daily brain [Off] series is it accessible from any point in an arc. From the very beginning the story is established in a precise manner that leaves future implications dazzling in its implications. The scope of the story is such that the plot moves slowly, and randomly at the time you watch it, in order that the second half of the series sends all the things you've accumulated thus far into the wood chipper and grinded into little tiny bits. Comedy, slice of life, dialogue heavy first 8 episodes? Good on you to soak it all in. Now go marathon the remaining 17 episodes.
So far it seems like the only thing I have going for you who are stuck in the earlier episodes and have no desire to move further is that things pick up later on. It's a valid reason to continue, but you're still wondering at this 9 of a score on the story. And does it deserve it? Hell yes, because while Steins;Gate starts off confusedly and slow, the ramp up in tension is so palpable, so extreme, that it's like being high and drunk and asleep all at the same time. The state of your mouse button will be worn down from the relentless clicking of 'next episode.'  So I'm sorry, but the payoff is like the best masturbation session you've ever had. You don't blow it off too early. I mean, that's what you're doing by not following up after the first 10 episodes or so.
Why is it not a 10? Why is Steins;Gate rated lower than Gintama? I disagree with MAL, but Steins;Gate's story does have its problems. And because Story = Steins;Gate, that the strongest and most visible attribute of the series is not perfect, means that the series is not absolute perfection. But it comes darn close.
First off, it's not perfect because the theories of time travel and divergent time lines are not fully elucidated for the perfectionist detail oriented viewer. There are holes in the science, in the events that are shown in the anime but explained in the visual novel. They nagged me like that tiny pebble in your shoe for about two episodes or so. But by the time I realized they were a problem, I also realized I simply did not care anymore. Now to me, that's surprising and great, because a show that can make you not care about its imperfections means it did a whole lot of things right other than its one aspect. And so we move on.
ART & SOUND (8.5)
Technical production values were extremely high. It is a little off-putting in the beginning to see all muted tones and off white color schemes, but you realize after a while, that this IS Steins;Gate. The technical production team really did a nice job here. If you get the Blu-Ray, which I highly recommend you acquire, you can see how flawlessly animation flows and how well the characters, enviros, and effects are detailed throughout the show. A little minor gripe is that sometimes character facial expressions looked slightly distorted. But again, that's nitpicking.
Sound was, for the most part, excellent. In fact, Steins;Gate's BGM was amazing. Considering that it was mostly taken from the visual novel, the insertion songs were placed aptly, chosen well, and correctly emphasized whatever was occurring during that scene. The OP, on the other hand, was polarizing. For 2/3 of the show, I did not enjoy it. But as all things come to be, I grew to like it. I still don't know how this shift occurred, probably Stockholm Syndrome? Got captured by this series- that must be it...
CHARACTER (10)
Here is another crux of Steins;Gate. While the story is necessary and essential, these characters, Okabe ""Mad Scientist"" Rintarou, Makise Kurisu, Daru, Mayushii, and others really drove this series past its plot into something special. They made the plot resound. Surprisingly all of Steins;Gate's characters fall into some archetype or another, and yet, somehow, they bring an element into the execution that is both original and highly entertaining.
I really can't say enough about Okabe Rintarou whose character conception is done and executed extremely well. Generic my ass, that type of boring male protagonist is beheaded like Makoto in School Days, and instead you get one of the most memorable male leads in all of anime. Move over Kamina, here's Mado Scientist Houin Kyouma! Seriously, the guy's character is as unique as you can find, eccentric and goofy, but surprisingly and fortunately, his emotional depth is also second to none. Instead of the jerk with a heart of gold, he's a mad scientist with a body of real. His interactions with his lab mates are endearing, touching, dramatic, comedic, and serious, at all the right points. That is wonderful.
I haven't even gotten to Makise Kurisu, Daru and Mayushii, but I can tell you right now that they fit their archetypes to an art, but also set new bars for enjoying those archetypes. This fitting into your anime stereotypes is also done somewhat tongue-in-cheek as you have the characters sometimes breaking the third wall in terms of describing what's going on.
Some reviewers have criticized that Steins;Gate devolves into a human interest story halfway through the series and that is not entirely incorrect. True, the latter half of the series skips the whimsical theory-crafting and slice of life style that is reminiscent of shows like Bakemonogatari, but I think those reviewers are ever so slightly missing the point. Yes, you don't want an anime to become a mindless pathos-ridden drama with characters tear stained faces grimacing in dismay and anguish as bad events befall them while you can only face palm. (Yes, you know what shows I'm talking about.) However, Steins;Gate has a plot of which the theme, time travel, by itself an element that lends itself heavily to human interest stories. If you can manipulate time, you alter events, and events are done by people, so people inherently are affected. Thus for the story not to include a significant human interest element is irrational and nonsensical. That said, I am pleased to announce that Steins;Gate pulls off this human element superbly, and while things are wrapped up neatly and conveniently, it never seems too forced or contrived. I mean, what can you say about a show that lets you manipulate time to contrive your ends? 
In addition, perhaps my biggest praise for this show goes to how they ended it. A good ending done right with just the right amount of closure. It ended so well, that this show really is a standardbearer for how conclusions should be done. Just don't forget to watch the episode 25 OVA as well.
For lack of a better word, these characters make you CARE. All great shows do this and so I leave it like that. Character and plot are closely entwined in Steins;Gate, and neither is lacking. 
ENJOYMENT (10)
What can I put here other than 10? Well, frankly if I counted the first 10 episodes, maybe this score would have gone down by 0.5. Not because it's not any good in the beginning, but that it takes a while for the story to start up. And yet, there is absolutely no filler. Could Steins;Gate have paced the first half of the season slightly better? Yes. But this is nitpicking. I really can't say anything else other than, I loved the fuck out of this show, and is one of the few shows that made me think beyond the anime itself. Case in point, if you were to actually think about the implications of world lines and divergence ratios, and how events could (fictitiously of course) play out on the basis of this theory, I guarantee you will mindfuck yourself to some degree.
OVERALL (10)
TL;DR I really think you should watch this show.
If you're stuck in the early going, I highly suggest you tough it out. There are PLENTY of worse shows to not watch, so do take the time out of your day to actually watch something good. It's a rare treat when a show's premise sticks with you long after you watch the climax and finale. Steins;Gate was one such anime.

                ‚ÄúEl Psy Congroo‚Äù
-Okabe Rintarou
I‚Äôve had a lot of people ask me to do a review of my favorite anime of all time, and honestly I found it difficult the first few times I tried. It was 2012, and I hadn‚Äôt watched a single anime in years, and I happened to stumble upon a friend at work watching Steins;Gate in the break room. I initially disregarded the show, chalking it up as some other gimmicky cartoon, having ‚Äúgrown out‚Äù of anime in general. That night when I got home, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to stop thinking about it, and after swallowing my pride I asked him
                  if I could download it. 
Of course I watched it all in one sitting. And again a few days later. I was hooked on anime once again.
Not only did Steins:Gate reinstate my love for anime, it became a big turning point in my life. Instead of putting on some sort of facade, I began to embrace my nerdy personality and never looked back.
Produced by White Fox (Katanagatari, Akame ga Kill) in 2011, Steins;Gate took many by surprise with its complex yet understandable interpretation of time travel, something very hit and miss with anime. Following the self-proclaimed ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù Okabe Rintarou, viewers get a first hand look into the mundane and enthralling aspects of science, propelled by a suspenseful plot and enigmatic duo of Okabe and Makise Kurisu. Through 24 unforgettable episodes, Steins;Gate explores a plethora of time travel topics with impeccable finesse and crafts an ultimatum-esque ending that‚Äôll be sure to make you shed a tear‚Ä¶ or ten.
The first major point I want to expound upon is the first 6-8 episodes. Yes, I understand they are slow. In fact, I‚Äôve known unfortunate souls who have dropped the series entirely based on the impression of these beginning episodes. Only while watching SG for the second time did I fully come to appreciate the legitimacy and purpose of these episodes. Not only do the writers take the time to flesh out the cast, they provide a rather no frills look at how experimentation really is. Coming from someone who‚Äôs an engineer by trade, I can tell you that most of the time, science IS boring. There‚Äôs insurmountable work for a very small payout. Honestly, the writers pay homage to the stress and pondering scientists do in order to discover the next big breakthrough. There are also a deceivingly large amount of foreshadows and tidbits you may not have caught on your first watch during these episodes that I‚Äôd urge you to go back and check out again. Does this make for good entertainment? No, unfortunately unless you can relate to this sort of thing, or the characters and their interactions gripped you from the get-go, this introductory period may not be the best part of the series for you.  
it wasn't until Okabe accidentally sent a text to his friend‚Äôs phone (which just so happened to be in a microwave) that SG really start going into overdrive. The latter two thirds of the series is binge worthy, with tons of twists and turns and Okabe‚Äôs emotions and will power is thoroughly tested. Although Okabe is mostly bombastic and even sometimes delusional, the writers do a decent job causing the viewers to really sympathize with what he's going through during the time lapses. It's one of the most well written stories in modern anime. The dialogue between characters is also well composed. It's not frivolous or over intellectual, nor does it stoop down to the lowest mental level. It achieves a nice balance that everyone can relate to.
Another aspect of the writing that's done exceptionally well is the time travel. Instead of being ‚Äúa ball of timey wimey stuff‚Äù (yes I'm looking at you, Doctor Who) like another anime, there are strict rules within SG‚Äôs time hopping which helps the viewer mold a coherent understanding of this element. there's a limit to how long of a text you can send to the past or future, and there are certain aspects of timelines that you just can't change. SG doesn't pander to the over analytical or become too pretentious for its own audience. despite what your own thoughts are on time travel, there is little argument that an anime has illustrated the concept better than this. it should almost be renamed, Time Travel Done Right: The Anime. SG even goes beyond its own theories to incorporate real life events like the atomsmashers in Europe or the intriguing man that is John Titor, someone who has claimed to unlock the powers of time travel on online forums.
Okabe relates to me quite significantly as a character. He has his fair share of quirks, but underneath his crafted smokescreen is a highly serious and compassionate individual. This bit of characterization gives him unlimited potential to grow as a person through the various trials he's put up against. Just imagine how crazy you would feel after time traveling to a familiar place, but no one else knows your secret. Add on the fact that you're already a little bit weird‚Ä¶ how hard do you think it would be to convince everyone you're telling the truth? Mamoru Miyano absolutely nails his role in the Japanese dub, with more sporadic voice inflections then you can possibly imagine. Yep, mad scientist to a T.
Although Steins;Gate is a healthy 24 episodes long, it's just not enough time to appropriately develop such a large cast. The end result is that some of the characters appear to only serve the purpose of fulfilling a certain trope. You have the perverted otaku, a nyan ‚Äúcat girl‚Äù, the cute and innocent one and your typical tsundere. This can be a turn off for some people, but the central focus of this anime is on Okabe. Kurisu does provide a healthy amount of balance to Okabe‚Äôs eccentric nature, and their relationship blossoms beautifully towards the end of the anime. It's one of those relationships where she's the only one for him, as clich√© as that sounds. It reminds me a lot of Nodame Cantabile, just the other way around.
The animation in SG is quite good, but I'd expect nothing less from white fox. Having been there myself, the artist do a brilliant job capturing the atmosphere in Akihabara. The time travel segments are animated with scrupulous detail, and also incorporate a fair amount of delusion into the excerpts. Each character is unique in design, and their emotions are emblazoned on their faces during certain scenes. 
‚ÄúHacking to the Gate‚Äù is one of the most iconic anime OPs I can remember. The animation is concise and contains a considerable amount of foreshadowing, which is a refreshing difference from the out of place OPs you see in some modern shows. The ED is also fitting to each episode, with the music being a nice contrast to the pace of the anime. OST wise, Steins;Gate is exceptional again. Each track couples marvelously with the mood of the scene it‚Äôs accompanying, and I've since downloaded the soundtrack and is just enjoyable to listen to standalone. Voice acting is outstanding in both the English and Japanese dubs. Most notably in the role of Okabe, which I previously mentioned.
It's no question that I fully recommend Steins;Gate. It reinvigorated my love for the medium, and at times it feels like an anime created for me. It's got suspense, a unique love story, time travel and intricate dialogue to go with it. There‚Äôs symbolism and thematic exploration, but it isn't as inaccessible or vague as some other anime out there. This is an anime that both elitists and casuals enjoy, which is another testament to its brilliance. Thanks as always for reading, Tu Tu Ru!",10
"
                What more can I say about this anime that hasn't already been said? It's a fantastic show that left an impression on me and I absolutely loved the journey.
The story is so well written that I think it is arguably one of the best scifi anime's out there, the pacing for me was perfect, it took its time to introduce the characters and while people might see it as slow to start off, the payoff is definitely worth the wait. The story is about a self proclaimed ""Mad Scientist"" named Okabe Rintarou but prefers to be called HOUOIN KYOUMA who experiments the theory of time
                  travel with his other lab members and he come's across a breakthrough that could change the face of science forever. 
The art is very dark and rather realistic look to it which actually compliments the theme and atmosphere very well, there are not too many locations, most of it is in the lab which is a small room. I really loved the character designs as they were all very unique and suit their personalities very well. 
I loved the opening of steins gate, the voices are spot on, the bgm is subtle and rather quiet and my only nitpick is that they had good oppurtunities for bgm at times but it wasn't utilized but apart from that it was amazing.
This is the crowning achievement for me because I loved every character, all of them likeable. Kurisu or Kristina the Tsundere, Daru the otaku, Mayurii the childish girl with a pure heart, and of course HOUOIN KYOUMA (Okabe Rintarou) who is eccentric, arrogant, paranoid but still likeable because it fits him perfectly. There is no character development apart from Okabe who changes himself for the better but still manages to keep his old traits. Watching him throughout the series and his interactions with others is what really makes the show interesting to watch and be invested as to what they do.
This show while slow at the start becomes incredibly interesting that you cannot help but feel happy, sad, and curious. It's definitely one of the best anime's I have seen and have recommended it to a lot of people.",10

                On paper, Steins; Gate presents an interesting mix of genres.  Steins; Gate (SG) is a psychological thriller, in the same genre as Code Geass and Ultimate Survivor Kaiji.  Also, SG is a visual novel adaptation, similar to Clannad or Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai.  Most VN adaptations (including SG) have a harem setup and dramatic romance.
Unfortunately, SG isn't as thrilling as Code Geass and Kaiji, and it doesn't have the comedy, romance or charm factor of most good romance/dramas.
Story (7)
The story has a lot of interesting sci-fi concepts.  The little laboratory team has a machine that can send text messages to
                  the past.  If the receiver of the message in the past acts upon the message and significantly changes the past, the future is changed as well.  Later on, there is a machine that sends memories to the past.  That is also very cool.
The text message machine raises a few questions.  If the text messages change the past, only the things affected by the message are different from the previous reality in the SG world.  If one rewrites (""shuffles"") history and changes world lines, shouldn't many things overall in the world get shuffled and changed?  If you shuffle a deck of cards, will they be in the same order as before you shuffled them?  Even things not affected by the text message shouldn't be the same, if the world is rewritten.  This is just one example of the logic gaps or questions in Steins; gate.
The outline of the plot is good.  An evil organization, SERN, has learned about the time machine, and they are trying to take it over so they can rule the world under a police state.  In episode 12, there is a great plot twist that really gets the story moving.  There is a promising outline for a story, which progresses after Episode 12.
However, almost everything before episode 12 is so boring, and drags horribly.  In one episode, the lab team sits in front of a computer for 20 minutes, which is very unexciting.  The first 11 episodes are filled with bad attempts at humor from the cliched members of the lab team.  The second half picks up the pace, but it is dragged down by the dramatic harem, where the male lead helps each girl in need.  The harem in SG is weak because it does not match the thriller genre, and the romance is average at best.
SG finally gets thrilling in the last couple episodes, and ends very nicely.  Overall, the SG story is good, but with a lot of wasted potential.
Characters (6)
The best character in SG is the male lead, Okabe.  He plays the mad scientist role very well.  He likes to stir things up with the other lab members and make some jokes.  He pretends to call on his phone, which is usually funny.  He is a crazy eccentric, which works.  Despite being head of the science lab, he is sometimes as dumb as the average harem lead.  But overall, Okabe is a solid character.
The problem is the rest of the characters.  Instead of a female lead with personality, we get a textbook tsundere (Christina) instead.  She caters to the Toaru Majutsu no Index fanbase.  If you've seen many tsundere series, you may be tired of the stale act after the first couple of episodes.
The fat male assistant, Daru, provides pandering jokes (about having ""2-D waifus"" and the like).  His jokes feel really out of place most of the time.  The other female main is the same as Shiro from Deadman Wonderland, and she adds nothing to the series.
The side charactes are even worse.  There is a cat maid, which is really out of place in this sci-fi series.  Even more out of place is the boy dressed in drag, who has a crush on the mad scientist.  The characters are harem-style, which does not fit in a good sci-fi story.  Okabe's interactions with the girls (and guy) is really awkward in the second half, with a lot of ridiculous drama.  One of the lowest points of the series is Okabe going on a date with the trap, which does not fit the ""thriller"" label.
There is some very good interaction between Okabe and Christina throughout this series, but the rest is annoying.  6 is a high score for an average cast like this.
Art and sound: (7 and 8)
The art is a strong point of SG.  The characters are drawn very well and are attractive.  There are some well-done special effects for when time traveling machines are used. The art looks good, although it is similar to many other series.  But the dark atmosphere is conveyed well.
The sound is great.  Okabe's voice actor (Miyano Mamoru, best known as Yagami Light of Death Note) does a great job of voicing the mad scientist.  Christina's voice is also excellent.  The soundtrack works well with the plot and setting, although none of the tracks are memorable.
Enjoyment (7)
The emotional aspect of SG comes through very well at times.  In the middle of the series, Okabe repeatedly goes back in time to save his best friend, Mayushi, and fails each time.  Okabe has to watch her die many times, which is very sad and depressing.  Also, the romance between Okabe and the girl he confesses to is done well.  It's far from the best romantic relationships in anime, but it works well.  The romance/drama is one of SG's stronger qualities, as expected from a VN adaptation.
The negative for enjoyment is that SG is not thrilling, except for a few episodes.  Some of that is due to the time-travel setup.  If Okabe messes up, he can just rewind and try again an unlimited number of times.  It is more thrilling when a characters actions have consequences.  For example, if Kaiji (from the Ultimate Survivor Kaiji series) messes up one of his gambles, he'll die or spend the rest of his life in a forced labor camp!!!  In SG, the character can just press the reset button.  The time travel in SG is better for emotions than thrills.  Some of the logical leaps in the final episodes were cringe-worthy, as well.
Overall, Steins; Gate is a good series, but it is very overrated.  It has some good points, but it is not a masterpiece.  Other series (particularly Noein and The Tatami Galaxy) have used time travel better, without weak characters and plot holes.  SG's strongest points are interesting sci-fi concepts, Okabe's character, and some of the romance/drama.  However, several flaws keep this down to a 7 in my book.

                ‚ÄúHe who wants to do good knocks at the gate; he who loves finds the gate open.‚Äù
Steins;Gate is often touted as one of the most complex and engaging time-travel stories in recent memory; a sci-fi thrill ride that holds at its core, a tender tale of love and friendship that touched me. Originally a visual novel highly praised for the attention to detail, branching plot points and masterful utilisation for that style of game-play, the anime adaptation by Studio White Fox carefully blended these aspects from the game into a compelling plot traversing several timelines for a memorable experience unlike no other. Revolving around a
                  makeshift lab group that unexpectedly wound up inventing their own time machine, they explore the idea of ‚ÄúD-Mails‚Äù: messages sent back in time with the potential to change the world around them. But curiosity gets the better of them and they delve too far into the realm of time-travel, taking viewers on an enthralling journey filled with intrigue and upset. This journey starts with a more light-hearted approach to introducing characters and concepts that come with some pacing issues, before the series takes a drastic change in tone and stakes, turning into the emotional rollercoaster that makes Steins;Gate a masterpiece in the eyes of many. The consensus is this shift marks the point where the show ‚Äúgetz guud‚Äù, but what‚Äôs often left unrecognized is how essential the slower, witty earlier episodes were for the weight and tension to have such a profound effect.
Set amidst the sun-beaten city of Akihabara lies one self-proclaimed ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù Rintaro Okabe, the man with the plan to thwart malevolent strategies of the elite, an underground freedom fighter striving for justice. A seminar on time-travel has caught his eye, but only comes to find out it‚Äôs nothing more than plagiarism. After causing a ruckus and leaves he stumbles across something much more alarming ‚Äì the dead body of a young auburn-haired girl. Disheartened he texts the news to a friend, and with the click of a button, the world around him changes in an instant. At first glance it all appears identical, but soon learns his memories do not quite match with his surroundings, most notably Makise Kurisu, the woman he thought dead appears before him alive and well. What follows is an uncanny chain of events that bring Okabe and Kurisu together as the duo along with the rest of the Future Gadget Laboratory seek to understand how such events came to be; the science behind it all. During this time the entire cast is introduced in some way, with adequate time spent fleshing out characters. 
Okabe shines as star of the show, bombarding scenes with several bursts of ridiculous theories and conspiracies of a supposed ‚ÄúOrganization‚Äù, even referring himself in third-person as ‚ÄúHououin Kyouma‚Äù. The scientist is anything but lucid, coming off an enigma equipped with such comical prose that has all around him in awe. Or bewilderment. Nevertheless he keeps the level of intrigue at constant max. Next to him is fellow scientist Makise Kurisu, except she legitimately warrants the title as a genius neuroscience researcher, famous for many accomplishments at such a young age. She‚Äôs a firm believer in order and logical reason, making her a perfect opposite for our protagonist and has no problem pointing out Okabe‚Äôs bulls**t. Unfortunately for her, she‚Äôs also a tsundere ‚Äì a trait Okabe often teases her for. The dynamic between the polarizing duo is always creative, playful and especially a treat when attempting to explain technobabble and scientific lingo. Makise acts as the level-headed, analytical shadow to back up Okabe‚Äôs imaginative and expressive mind, with the plot being a perfect environment to develop a relationship between the two over the course of the show. 
Other members of the Future Gadget Laboratory consist of Mayuri, Okabe‚Äôs childhood friend and the most upbeat of the group, with her optimistic and somewhat dim-witted nature has her regulated to keeping team morale high. However, she becomes an essential part of the plot progression in the latter half. Daru, the sarcastic hacker of the group and a colossal pervert, but with a preference to a subtler approach, allowing for more glimpses of his good nature to shine past his vulgar behaviour. Suzuha, a tomboy that started working near the lab and is drawn towards their work, but constantly shows to know more that she should about the group. There‚Äôs also a woman that only communicates through text message, a maid with a knack for cat noises, a man with the mannerisms and voice of a woman‚Ä¶ yet still a dude, etc. Steins;Gate happens to have a cast full of intriguing, quirky personalities with constant chemistry between them and a distinct script to match that keep the slow parts of the story worth the investment.
Perhaps the most notable aspect of the writing in Steins;Gate comes from its concept of time travel and how it‚Äôs integrated in the narrative. Most time travel stories never go in depth with any rules or limitations that come when tampering with time; rather only use the idea as basic plot devices, but this is when Steins;Gate breaks from the crowd ‚Äì it aims to give viewers a solid understanding of what is and isn‚Äôt possible, along with effects that come as a result of hopping through ‚ÄúWorld Lines‚Äù: divergent worlds that one can move to and from through time intervention. This is shown through using D-Mails to change Okabe‚Äôs reality; the only one with the ability to carry memories across when the timeline is altered, permitting viewers to witness the phenomena from his perspective; a fresh take on the common butterfly effect. It‚Äôs a unique, believable perception on the subject which works coherently with the narrative for the most part, giving the series an edge over other time-related shows. However Steins;Gate never gets bogged down in theories or tries to explain itself to the over-analytical; les not forget the original time machine is basically a phone connected to a microwave. It understands the strengths of being a piece of entertainment, effectively balancing hard science with fun hijinks. What I also find impressive is how the theories presented evolve proportionately as experiments are performed, to where the discoveries made are ground-breaking and immensely sought after by powerful organizations. Grasping the severity of their situation leads them to ponder how and if they should continue research, questioning what‚Äôs more important to them as a group ‚Äì touching on topics I never expected from a show so deceptively comedic.
Sadly, as everyone who‚Äôs finished the series knows, this deception was not meant to last. Looking back, there‚Äôs a significant amount of foreshadowing sprinkled across this period, that something drastic was bound to happen. Something was coming, and no matter what choices were made, they were not going to stop what is now destiny‚Ä¶
‚ÄúMy watch has stopped.‚Äù
This is the point when Steins;Gate shows its hand, moving from the funny, well-written slice of life we knew to a darker, intense thriller that never looks back; as if the series took a shot of adrenaline where the rush of exhilaration is almost palpable. It still has its fair share of humour present, but now the direction of the show is clear; Okabe desperately trying to escape from fate‚Äôs clutches after countless time leaps all lead to the same predicament followed with the same result: death. Like the watch and hourglass show, the time for fun and games is over. The conflict of ‚ÄúMan vs Time‚Äù conveyed here was excellent, with time serving as an unforgiving, ubiquitous antagonist and a cruel reminder of the dangers that come from meddling with multiple world lines. Tension and stakes are raised to the heavens as Okabe must try and reverse all the effects of past D-Mails sent in order to return to the original timeline in a nail-biting thrill-ride if he ever wishes to reach happiness, whilst doing so allows for a greater understanding behind each character‚Äôs motivation for their personally sent D-Mail. Unfortunately some subplots, most notably the romance-driven ones with side characters can come of flat, tedious and even ludicrous, falling victim to common visual novel tropes that do more harm than good here. However Steins;Gate still holds up throughout thanks to Okabe and the tribulations he faces.
It‚Äôs easy to get lost in the world of Steins;Gate ‚Äì the mostly smart plot, eccentric cast, striking visuals, beautiful music, etc. are all great pieces to the series on their own, but what makes the show so incredible in the eyes of many is thanks to Okabe. While originally established as an off-the-wall character whose oddities can come off strange or jarring, his actions and thoughtfulness keep him from becoming a mere walking ball of cringe and more like an actual human. But it‚Äôs not until Okabe finds himself in a never-ending cycle of despair where his outlandish persona is revealed to be just a mask; a fa√ßade to hide his true feelings. The incredibly wacky mad scientist is still a part of his essence, but that‚Äôs all it is, a singular part of the whole Okabe. His moments of compassion beforehand are only glimpses to his true self, and it‚Äôs not until his smokescreen is blown away when we are left with a near-painfully kind individual that longs to form bonds with others. At the heart lies a lonely man who finds difficulty in expressing himself, and when push comes to shove he can be deadly serious and sombre. The juxtaposition between his former idiosyncratic self and this broken man now is so brilliantly written that watching it all unfold hits hard, coming across a lot more empathetic and, dare I say relatable than what most people are comfortable coming to terms with. Pushing him so far down a desolate, agonizing state made him realize his disguise and reminded him what he really cares about most, urging him to rise against adversity and be the hero he needs to be, leaving viewers to experience one of the most suspenseful arcs in all of anime.
When looking at the technical side of Steins;Gate, there‚Äôs something alluring with the art used: striking character designs with uncanny, intimidating eyes and stark textures comes off expressive and engaging. Coupled with a high contrast, sterile pallet that adds to sci-fi and mystery elements, often giving a grounded, dreary feel that somehow manages to compliment the numerous antics taking place on screen. Speaking of, there‚Äôs a clear understanding of camera placement and shot composition present throughout, almost always feeling as though viewers are in Okabe‚Äôs head. The cinematography and lighting is used to maximum effect, never relying on animation to keep the story moving forward. The animation used is solid, but not particularly noteworthy and cannot compete with some of the best animation of its year, though this is never a problem as the overall presentation does a splendid job capturing the bleak setting with muted colour schemes and easily transitions between different atmospheres. 
Regarding the sound, Steins;Gate always manages to hit the right notes at the right times. The soundtrack composed of piano pieces that when used consistently helped increase the impact of the emotional and powerful moments, with both ‚ÄúGate of Steiner‚Äù and ‚ÄúBelieve Me‚Äù standout tracks that were always a pleasure to listen to. But nothing compares to the anime‚Äôs opening, ‚ÄúHacking to the Gate‚Äù, an iconic theme with some of the best use of concise animation, symbolism and subtle foreshadowing in recent memory, bound to get even the deaf excited for the show. The ED‚Äôs used are also very well done in their own right, but nothing is going to come close to matching the sheer hype of the OP. The voice-acting for both subbed and dubbed versions are outstanding, most notably for the main character, matching the witty dialogue with a magnetic tone and range that is rarely found in the medium. The only issue with the English dub is the slight changes in the script that can negatively impact on the immersion, but with a series like this I highly doubt that would be a problem for most.
Steins;Gate is like a puzzle that slowly and methodically comes together over the course of its run, combining pieces of a great time travel tale with gripping drama to bring us something special, doing so with grand flourish. Looking back there certainly are issues and flaws apparent, but they aren‚Äôt enough to stop the wonderful ride Steins;Gate takes you on: a journey filled with all sorts of emotions and intrigue that is nearly unmatched. What started as pure innocuous curiosity ultimately came down to Okabe having to choose between the two people he cares about most where he‚Äôs left with an impossible decision, making for an incredibly tragic climax. The ending does cheapen this highpoint and is poorly constructed compared to the rest of the runtime, but personally I feel Okabe and the series in general deserved the kind of conclusion it got ‚Äì the true end emphasizing that getting what you want always comes with a level of sacrifice, but by enduring such, you have the power the overcome any obstacle in your way.

All it takes is a push, and you can remember. The memories of those lost three weeks. The memories we made together. ""Welcome back, my assistant, Makise Kurisu -- no, Christina."" I reach into my pocket and take out the last pin. Nobody knows what the future holds. And that is why, just as this reunion demonstrates, the possibilities are endless. I place this pin in Kurisu's hand. I gently close her hand in mine. And, holding back my tears, I tell her... ""This is the choice of Steins Gate."" ~",8

                The most frostbitten and grim problem in science fiction is that it does not go well with actual science.
The second problem is that it usually appeals only for popular and trendy themes without going further into their hard scientific side, which can be used to understand them realistically. I'm not talking about turning all science fiction into thorough research on the problems and tying it up to reality, but about careless swinging the science like it can do everything at any time you wish. Sad to say it, but a lot of science fiction authors pretend not to notice that science needs a REALLY long
                  time to progress - therefore, they write stories about sudden revolutionary plot devices or techniques which can make science move faster and attract the common viewer's attention.
The worst problem is very often these are invented or operated by young and unexperienced ones. And if they need to be experienced or just able to do something right, authors turn them to the Chosen Ones or geniuses, to describe the whole impossibility of the plot.
And here comes Steins;Gate: an anime about the youth of the nation changing the world. While still being young, unexperienced and, most of all, plain mindless.
___________________________
Through approximately the last 10 years Japanese authors developed a kind of fetish about exploiting the young geniuses theme. Note: somehow in every third series, movie or OVA you can see a young adult, or nearly adult, or worst of all - a teenager savviyng no worse than its adult counterparts, which - in the worst case - will stand for a kind of moving useless background doing nothing intelligible. They are supposed to be professionals, but their professionality is only stated, never proven.
This is due to the fact creators need to describe the characters of specific age in order to attract a specific target audience so that their actions were understandable for viewers, or even persuaded them to think about their own actions. Even if the authors have to give to the child a mind and/or charisma which basically is unable to accumulate in such a young age. Yes, even if that child would be born and raised in a Masonic lodge and would learn to converse from aged seasoned prostitutes.
When in school, I knew a lot of really smart people, guys and girls. You can say we were attending the same club (the biology club). They were very aspiring, and later did well in their lives, but no one of the smartest girls was a egregiously imbalanced wench with a nearly perfect appearance publishing in scientific magasines since grade school. Hell, even the smartest girl of our club looked like a mop wearing loose T-shirt: she only cared for her mind, not for her appearance. Nerd girls go in this category too. You may like their intentions, but not their looks.
There are really few true geniuses in our world, but... now it's a kind of fashion to give a genius label to anyone who does not behave like a typical consumer. I do not deny that some people grasp something from childhood better than others - but not every second one. However, if we now look at the creations of Japanese authors in total, we see that in the anime version of Japan (note: described as real, otherwise it is an alternative history) the normal young people of current generation are not exposed to glamor (well, forget about kogals for now), do not smoke and drink heavily, have no streak for delinquency (we're laking about positively presented characters here, not obviously evil gang-bangers), are not typical consumers, and are not led by any basest interests. Pure ingenues.
No, of course not everyone are included in this list, but really a lot. And do not think I am a misanthrope: I respect everyone, unless the person in question is not a neo-Nazi, a feminist, a priest or a consumerism victim, which only wants to eat, to excrete and to entertain themselves.
Idealisation does not stop only on geniuses. Here come overly rich characters with their own maids or butlers, who own the whole lot and can easily make you vanish. Oligarchy is presented not in a negative vision, but in positive - these people bathe in champagne and eat caviar with golden ladles, spit on all others'heads emitting infernal laughs while covering their mouths, but we are forced to think this can be worked off. Instead of donating money for orphans, disabled people, cancer patients or the aforementioned science to make it go faster, they are living high lives, but still presented as lovable. 
Noblesse oblige? Screw these plebs, I'm the rich one here, plebs gonna suffer.
Double standards, don't you think so?
So, if we now look at the typical characters from a bad-written anime script, most of them are just loose, licked up, ideals. Stereotypical, formulaic bishounens and bishoujos; one can understand by looking at them they are nothing but the mind, the honor and the conscience of the nation. Even if they are totally washed otaku guys/yaoi fangirls. Every fifth of them is a genius and can save the world in one finger flick, but simply does not want to. Not because he or she can be quietly eliminated for these actions, but just because he or she just does not want, you see, there are more important problems, such as what said person will eat today. 
And, sadly, a few characters have a good, realistic image that would remind you of one of your friends. Not the escapist with a half-meter long crimson haircut, but your neighbor or friend or drinking buddy. They do not necessarily need a wild backstory with tears and drama: you simply make the characters actions appropriate in this situation, so that you can interpret it from your point of view.
___________________________
This anime is suffering primarily because of such kind of idealization of characters. A lot of formulaic, predictable and just boring gals are attached to the bunch of losers simply because... what? Right.
Here be place where a Main Problem of Juvenile Science Fiction appeared: yesterday's kids created something that mature and wise people with experience (as we thought) did not came up before. Customisation for the audience. Let's check them up: a stupid naive moegirl, an imbalanced foreigner girl with overly idealised mind AND appearance with no reason of being a classical tsundere, an annoying overly rich catgirl, a kuudere villain girl.
The typical fat otaku is displayed as idealised hacker. Let's just close our eyes on it: he even looks like a no-lifer... but, again, really heavily stereotyped. Again: mind, honor and conscience of the nation.
There goes time traveler Japanese girl saying that C(S)ERN will conquer the whole world in 2036. Whole world! 
What about Islamic countries and its uncontrollable monotheistic doctrine? Want more videos about heads cut off, now starring C(S)ERN scientists? 
Russia, which became even more wild in the last 20 years? They won't even reach Moscow without drowning in swamps.
North Korea, which dares to oppose everyone while being poor? It is the big and dangerously brainwashed hive which can lash on everyone the dictator does not like.
That's because there are a lot of Japanese science fiction authors (just like their American counterparts) thinking that their homeland is the center of the world: the homeland dies - the world dies along. They do not know a thing about the defensive abilities of other countries - they only judge the world by themselves. This makes a dystopian scenario origins quite clear.
Where was I? Even counting the fact that mature and wise people had already traveled in time before the losers club made it, the situation is not getting better. Authors have not explained the working principle of the oven: they just realized if they try to push at least one theory in the area where they know nothing, nerds and real scientists will bomb them with letters of offense. Therefore, they decided to keep silent, instead calling random pseudo-scientific thematic gibberish for nerds' fun and joy - just add a pair of facts taken from some Japanese gonzo editions for techies. If these things are already popular memes - they are already known by the people and will make more profit. The same reason forced them to make characters use said popular memes: the more visitors from the popular anonymous forums join the audience, the more of this series will be a profit. This is what you call a fanservice, not naked protagonists.
As everyday in modern Japan, this is never stated, but if you look, you'll see a very glaring detail: female domination in inappropriate places. Go and compare male protagonists with female protagonists: you can easily find out that females are always better, smarter, cuter and stronger in their will, and males are no-good losers. Liberal feminist conspiracy? You decide.
Art is nice, animation is good, but music is quite generic. Pop and rock with electric guitars, nothing new, conceptual and interesting. And generic piano in dramatic scenes. They could add some interesting instrument.
The only good thing in this anime is a complex multi-layered plot, which made everyone sing gospels for. But this plot, though really interesting, is hanging on pseudo-scientific strings and fanservice, and first I really enjoyed it.
But, if you try to forget everything mentioned before and just simply enjoy the show, you will notice the strange thing. Whenever the plot needs to be pushed forth, authors inject more and more undescribed and unreasonable rear-pulled plot techniques. Previously I've mentioned the Chosen One, and I really hoped there won't be such kind of characters.
WRONG.
Previously I endured the existence of impossibly smart characters, impossibly rich ones, impossibly naive, impossibly strong-willed and other impossibly idealized. But the power of Chosen One lying in Okarin hit my limit.
I barely completed these series.
___________________________
Later, my smart friends attended the top- and nearly top unis of the country, and I decided to choose something more mundane. Now I am a post-graduate microbiologist reseacher, I learned well about the inner works of science, and the ones mentioned in these series are nothing but... yes. Idealised ones.
In modern society, in a lot of cases, science is completely trusted or is not trusted at all. The hype around these series is caused only by this fact. An early idea about LHC opening a black hole was just shamelessly exploited like in a low-budget B-movie, but target audience ate it up. No matter that there was no black hole in actual LHC work at 2012: if there is a hypothesis, there is an exploitation of it. Hype must go on. 
They tried to darken the inner works of scientific society, pretending they know everything, but in reality it looks like a bad kind of darkfic.
On the other side there are people that trust science selectively and can easily distinguish pseudo-scientific gibberish for wannabe-kind of nerds from the real scientific facts.
You may also remember that over-hyped things never fulfilled all your wishes. This one is a nice example of being not so good as I wanted to.
The main fact is somebody really know about inner works of science. And they can't judge the book by its cover.
Unfortunately, Steins;Gate is nothing but cover. Therefore, +3 for the plot.
Nothing more deserves even a single plus.
That's all I can say about it.",3

                I could only make to 5 episodes. I came into this show with an open mind and somewhat high expectations for all the praises this anime received. I can say that I was thoroughly disappointed. 
To start with, the characters were insufferable. Especially the MC. He was one of the most obnoxious MCs I have seen in anime, and I've watched a fair amount of them. I will never understand how anyone can relate to his character. The way he belittles, pushes the boundaries and sexually harasses the female cast is also unredeemable. It seems sexual harassment is the peak of comedy in this anime.
                  His ""mad scientist"" act is very unbelievable and frankly too over the top. I cannot take his character seriously and lost all respect for him a few episodes in.
All the female characters had no substance to them- they were all typical anime sterotypes. The TUTURU one is especially annoying. It's as if a 5 year old was stuck in the body of a woman. The infantilization of women has always been an issue, and this specific character irritated me for that reason. 
I felt especially bad for red haired girl for having to put up with the MC and all his bs. Honestly, any real women in her position would've completely blocked him out of their lives by the first interaction with him. Her patience with dealing with the MC is extremely unrealistic and completely took me out of the show. 
I don't remember much of the other girl characters, but I'll never understand why they would chose to hang around an egoist that holds no respect for them. The male-gazey camera shots were also distasteful and made me uncomfortable.
Also I forgot to mention the otaku friend of the mc, but I won't even bother getting into why he's a terrible character...
I realize that the plot is said to pick up in the later half of the anime, but you could not pay me enough to sit through and watch all of this garbage. There's nothing that could redeem it in my eyes. I usually follow a three episode rule for determining if an anime is worth continuing and I gave this show more chances than it deserves.
I overall found this to be extremely irrating to watch and felt disgusted by how the male characters acted throughout the show. I've dealt with enough harassment from men in my daily life and I do not want to make myself watch a show that depicts it as comedy.",1
"
                Time Machine. What does one think when hearing those two words? Most of us (Americans, anyway) think of cheesy CGI movies that date back longer than we care to remember. We often avoid the subject entirely, since it's all theory and hardly can be proven with current technology.
Albert Einstein once said ""The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once.""
How true does this hold today, or more importantly, in this particular anime? Steins;Gate answer this, and much more.
The basic storyline is of a man by the name of Okabe Rintarou that accidentally discovers a way to send messages into the past.
                  I won't go into much detail past that, but from there, the story develops in such a way that you're gripping the edge of your seat, literally, popcorn flying from your hands as a new plot twist forever changes your perception of time, space - everything.
Because of the rave reviews from other viewers, I'll spare the detail of the art, story, sound, etc. But I do really want to talk about character development. No single major character (maybe excluding a few select minor characters) remained static. They all progressed as the storyline continued - to such an extent I can hardly call the main characters ""themselves"" anymore. Through experience after life changing experience, these characters' interactions changed their fundamental beliefs, views of life, and forever altered their faith on this particular subject.
At the beginning, it does start a bit disorientating. Much of the background is skipped, and the story delves head-first into the present. No time for such wimpy fillers and such, they ruin the overall mood of the story! Don't be discouraged, either - once the first couple of episodes runs its course, a larger picture emerges. One that leaves your jaw hanging by a thread, as you try and dissect the information that barrages you constantly. 
What surprised me immensely was the way the story drew you in - instead of trying to tease you with little hints here and there, Steins;Gate keeps you guessing from the beginning of the episode to the last dregs of the end. Most of time, you cannot see the fastball that's already flying towards your face; when you manage to finally see, it's too late, and you get smacked in the face by a curveball traveling who knows how fast. 
I digress - this anime was one of a kind. Though I cannot say much, because I have watched comparatively few anime, I can tell this is the golden egg of all TV shows. This series literally beats most of the Hollywood blockbusters I've managed to watch, and trust me, that's PLENTY.
This comes from a guy that used to laugh at such trivial notions like watching anime; please take my review into consideration and WATCH IT. You will not be disappointed in the least.",10
"
                 Arguably the most important element of a show like this is the characterisation. I'm usually not a big fan of otaku types, especially the zany weirdo ones. Steins;gate has some compelling character moments but looked at as a whole the cast is constructed from a heap of annoying clich√©s, a collection of muppets, if you will.
The whole story structure feels like it was directly taken from the VN, which was questionable decision since it didn't fit cohesively with the tv show format. What's with all the side quest episodes for secondary characters just popping up right in the middle of a dramatic and tension
                  filled arc? What's with the instances in the story were it is apparent that the gamer of the VN would've had to make a decision? 
Those scenes were just badly implemented and thats coming from someone who doesn't even have played that many VNs (but enough games that I know my fair share about structure and narrative). 
 My favorite part was the first cour, which a lot of folks seem to dismiss as necessary buildup to get to the hype stuff. The mystery and atmosphere was really compelling, so it disappointed even more when that was followed up by an overwrought and tediously confusing time travel plot. 
In conclusion: This is not the worst show I've ever seen by any means, but it's also not the masterpiece that most people seem to see it as. 
Maybe it just aged badly, quite like me in that regard I suppose.",4

                Steins;Gate was really quite an unremarkable series. 
Story:6 
We don't get anywhere in the story for at least the first 6 episodes. I get that a lot of setup was done in the beginning but it just ramped up way too slow for me. I truly believe that the story had quite a bit of potential, but I felt lost and confused throughout the series. However, I do enjoy the exposition- so feminine... and yet a dude! 
Art:5 
The colors are faded and the animation is a little janky, but perfectly mediocre. Overall, I'm unimpressed with this. Sound: 7
I do like the sound of this amine. It was good! 
Character: 3
It seems like the characters are way too flat. In fact, while I was watching this series with my best friend, we both thought that the characters were unimpressive, especially the girl with the red hair. Her entire deal seemed somewhat forced, and I felt like she could have been so much more profound.  She was the worst. Also, Mayuri serves no purpose other than to be a cute girl who doo du doooos a lot. 
Enjoyment: 3
The first few episodes were truly a challenge to sit through. After I finished these episodes, I couldn't understand a thing that I had seen. It was just too far out there. It makes a little more sense towards the end, but the story  could have been more powerful if the 12 episodes of filler were cut out.
Overall: 5
A pretty mediocre series. I don't get why this series draws such an enthusiastic fan base. Time travel in this anime is presented in a unique, although fairly unremarkable fashion. I understand that they might be trying to stay true to some theories, but it just isn't a good fit for a 24 episode series. I would have dropped this anime for sure if not for the almost universal acclaim it has so unjustly received.",5
"
                  Time traveling sure is a fascinating thing. The idea of being able to alter the past and the future leaves people in awe. In fact, it's so fascinating that many tv shows,movies,books, and animes use time traveling in their stories. Some of them are bad. Some of them are good, but none of them are quite like Steins Gate.
      The story revolves around Okabe Rintarou and his colleagues as they accidentally make a machine that can send texts back in time. Now what sets this anime apart from other shows about time travel is that the story is
                  almost always consistent. The reason why most shows about time travel crumble is because the concept of time travel is so complex and misunderstood. Which ends up in the show having big plot holes, and ends up failing. But one look into Steins gate and you know that the development team did their research before making the story.Concepts such as the butterfly effect have been used to fill up the problems that normally come from time travel. Now while most plot holes were fixed. Some still remain. But considering the amount of depth that came into the story. Such plot holes can be excused.
      Another thing that makes Steins Gate so wonderful is the characters. You have the paranoid self-proclaimed mad scientist Okabe Rintarou who talks to himself through the phone and believes that an organization is after him; The mature Kurisu Makise who argues with Okabe all the time; The childhood friend Mayuri Shiina that says tuturu so much that its annoying. The super cute Faris Nyannyan who cosplays. The beautiful Ruka Urushibara thats actually a guy. The quiet Moeka Kiryu.The super hacker Itaru Hashida. Now some people may argue that only the main characters developed. Now some people say that the only person who actually developed was Okabe. But considering the story I think thats actually a good thing. And really, if the other characters did develop. Steins Gate wouldn't be as good as it is now.
     The sound was good overall. The opening ""Hacking to the Gate"" is a nice opening and it fit the series well. So i'm actually rather glad that they didn't change the opening halfway. The ending also fit the show really well. The background music was varied and was overall pretty good. 
     The animation was also animated well. Character movement was fluid. Backgrounds were done well. Character animations looked good and creative. The only problem I have is that pretty much every character wears the same thing. But thats only a minor problem.
    Steins Gate is definitely one of, if not the best science fiction animes ever made. There are a few loose ends. But considering what Steins Gate has achieved. I can look past that. If, by some reason you haven't you haven't watched this anime yet.Open a new tab now and Watch it! You won't regret it.",9
"
                minor spoilers ahead:
the ""top anime"" section hasn't done me wrong before so i came into this with high expectations. this is probably the biggest letdown since my friend recommended devilman crybaby. 
this series starts off at a snail's pace and doesn't pick up until about 10 episodes in. it is extremely whack. once it picks up you think its gonna keep it up but you literally watch this dude undo all the changes made in the past and it is so uninteresting. this show is better than melatonin. sometimes funny, but that's about it. last 4 episodes were very good though, i will say.

                ~DECEIVE THE WORLD!~
From the get-go, Steins;Gate appeared to me as a pleasant, refreshing, and genuinely interesting SoL/Sci-Fi/Mystery. I settled in for what i thought would be just a well presented, quirky, cyber fugitive, mystery based show. The presentation appealed to me, as it seemed to be a clash between gloomy, detailed (and effective) realism, broken only by the wonderfully unique characters. While it retained a good sense of mystery, its deceivingly slow-starting plot didn't seem to mirror the extent that i REALLY wanted to keep watching...
Having gotten past that first, slower phase (very relevant indeed!), and watching to its completion...
I've come to ADORE this series!
                  It truly is JAW-DROPPINGLY BRILLIANT!
Here's why...
Steins;Gate will take you to theoretically impossible depths, that you would never foresee. Its plot is an insanely elaborate, entangled mesh of discovery, realization, deception, and more. It's vivid and beautiful, it links together faultlessly. It will warm your heart at times... confuse you... it may even lead you to fumble around the floor, for the jaw you just dropped.
Ultimately, it's a masterfully created plethora of truly touching, powerful, and meaningful time-shaping events - all of which link back to each other seamlessly - to what turned out to be an excellently well-rounded conclusion (so fear not, and watch to the end!).
Why does it work so well?
With Steins;Gate, Frontier did an excellent job of telling such a complex, just... perfect: time-based plot line, that is Vivid, and (ironically) believable enough to blow your mind. While also appearing dramatic, and engaging enough to really hit home - all while trying not to confuse the viewer TOO much.
The fact that they managed this balancing act amazed me, as nothing seemed to be compromised. Therefore reinforcing my belief, that it is THE most well thought out anime I've seen yet.
The pacing has always been its criticized point , and while it could have been better with more episodes, i could say this about ANY anime. Steins;Gate tells the story it sets out too very well. It's incredibly detailed, and though at some point around episode 9, it goes up a few notches in speed... If anything... this only intensified the chaos, and dramatic, edge-of-seat moments that MADE Steins;Gate, the mind-blowing show that it is renowned for being. As for those who complain about its slower start: sure, it's less entertaining... But press on, and then you will realize that it's utterly vital! Not only obviously for the scene setting, and character development, but Steins;Gate is one to make hard-hitting, meaningful self-references. These bring about giant twists, and a revolution each episode; that challenges past ideals, ways of thinking, and is guaranteed to take you by surprise. Once you get to a certain point, it will already be too late to stop, as these surprisingly frequent, and well established plot-shaping twists, will relentlessly change the way you feel about it all - and isn't THAT impact, the definition of an effective story... One that will have you coming back to watch the impossible, unfold in front of your eyes.
This escapist, mysterious, and thought provoking story is most definitely Steins;Gate's strong suit - and trust me it all leads to a very satisfying conclusion...
As if i hadn't already sold it to you, the plot is still only ONE of the MANY brilliant aspects of the show - what can i say? It just fulfills every criteria so well...
ART - Well... It almost looks looks real at times... Very detailed and appropriate!
SOUND - I'm a big fan of both the OP and ED. In terms of cinematic use, it continues to deliver the right emotions, at the right moments.
The CHARACTERS, i found to be unique, and really likable. Many of them have deep secrets, and are far from transparent. While their interactions are very realistic and appropriate, they are developed just enough (remember that it's an event-driven show) to incur attachment - and allow for the more emotional scenes to shine brightly, and strike hard. 
ENJOYMENT is an understatement when it comes to Steins;Gate. I found it all, immersive and masterfully executed (*running out of reviewing energy now*) - it really got me thinking, and on the edge of my seat at times. To CONCLUDE, if you're at all interested in a mindbogglingly beautiful Sci-Fi/Mystery based show, fortunately devoid of cliche, and enriched by an unfathomable depth, you will love it! (Just be sure to watch to the end if you do) :)

                Steins;Gate
Time Machine. A low income mad scientist with an obsession with conspiracies and futuristic gadgets. When the scientist himself is looped through time what will his reaction be? The animation is glum and gray but it gives it an eery and mysterious feel to it so its good. The comical jokes aren't made often but when they are they are funny. Since there is only one episode out i cant say much but based on the first ep i think it will develop to be pretty good. 
Something along the lines of Shinrei Tantei Yakumo.
Except funnier? I recommended it!
Thank You. Yume Tang!

                The best animated show I have ever seen. Period. I'll tell you why, hopefully.
At first when I read the synopsis I said to myself, ""this show doesn't look very good, time traveling with a microwave or something?"" it seemed kind of weird to me. But after a few weeks after I went ahead and gave it shot because of all the amazing reviews it got. The first 6 episodes were really good, but then after that it turned into something beyond excellence. Its hard to describe how great of a show it was the last 18 episodes. It pretty much changed my life. It also
                  taught me that you can't really cheat time or life for that matter. Many mixed feelings from this show, happiness, sadness, scared, confused and at the same time enjoying the heck out of the show. Now ill get to the review (Nostalgia is getting the best of me while writing this... sniff.... sniff)
Story 10/10
Before this show I hadn't seen any other show that has to do with time traveling or even science, there are probably some but none I have seen or heard of. And with this comes a very unique story. The pacing at first can feel slow for some people, but then after a few episodes. BAM. Twists after twist and then the pacing of the show moves perfectly as the show goes on. They truly used this story to its best, they didn't do anything half the effort. They put every bit of effort into this storyline and executed in an excellent way without messing it up. Because with time traveling as the story it could get really confusing and boring. But not the case here with Steins gate. Can't stress enough on how well the story is developed in this show. Don't want to say anything else. You'll have to watch the show to receive the awesomeness I got. 
Characters 10/10
Probably the best developed and interesting characters of any show I have seen, especially the major ones. Okabe is charismatic, comedic, thoughtful, kind, and very intelligent. He definitely means good intentions for everyone and everything he does. He'll always act like someone is calling him on his phone in times of when he doesn't know what to say, which fits in great with whatever scene he is in. And he is guy that will never give up and puts forth every bit of effort into what he does. Very original, definitely not your typical clich√© character. Makise. Main female protagonist of the show. Definitely a tsundere and my favorite also. At first seems like your typical tsundere character but later on in the series really develops quite well and we get to see different sides of her throughout the show. Takes an interest into Okabe and helps him in his journey of the time machine and his struggles. Also very intelligent. Would get into more detail about the other characters but these two are the main, main characters that make the show the best it can be. The other characters are great too. Well developed and have great personalities that fits in well with the show. The only other show that rivals this with character development would be code geass or clannad (those shows have good character development, right?) but great job here also.
Art/Animation 9/10
While not perfect here, definitely above average. The character art is great for all the characters. Wont say much here. Animations are fluid and smooth. Overall has a dark tone to the series especially the last 16 or so episodes. Lighting is great also.
Sound 8/10
Definitely the weakest part here, but not weak on its own. The opening is pretty good, fits well with the series. Soundtrack is good. Nothing really special here.
Overall 10/10
I enjoyed watching this more than any other show. The characters are so likeable all in their own way. You'll definitely feel for each character at the end of the show. This show will make you cry, laugh, and smile. Well it should. It was that awesome. This will probably be the only show I will re watch just because of the amazing storyline and character list. Such a unique show nothing really else like this. Very original, not sure if that means its good or bad, but probably good. Didn't think it was boring for one second. If there would be a flaw, it would probably be the slow start to the show, but I don't think it is, it might be for some people though.
I would start watching this show right now if I were you, it will definitely be worth your time, it was worth my time. And you might think if just some fanboy for steins gate, but I don't think that is the case. This show is amazing, a masterpiece. 
One more thing, I don't really recommend watching the OVA, it kind of ruined the ""feelings"" I had after the original series. If I were I would wait a few days after watching the show, then watch the movie (which is awesome also) and then if you really want to you can watch the OVA, that's my take on it.",10
"
                This is my first review so give me some feedback.
Steins;Gate is a story of an eccentric scientist named Okabe Rintarou as he messes around with various things in his lab with his friend/acquaintance Daru and childhood friend Mayuri who he holds very close to his heart. Okabe is interested in the theory of time travel, so he attends a conference held by a man proclaiming to have solved time travel. While at the conference, Okabe witnesses something extremely shocking (not going to tell you because that's the mystery of the first episode in case you haven't watched it), to which he sends a message to
                  Daru about it. Okabe suddenly jolts from the current reality into a completely new one, in which the mysterious event did not occur and only he has any memories of. Okabe struggles to understand what caused this and if it can be repeated, and what the consequences may be.... And thus our journey begins.
**Story (10/10)**
It's the strong point of the show. Even people who don't like the show admit the story is on point and is extremely unique. I cannot tell you much about anything that happens because it's riddled with plot twists and it's best to go in with no knowledge of anything that actually happens. That being said, I can tell you it's a time travel, sci-fi, mystery, thriller, but has elements of drama, romance, and comedy. Basically, it has it all.
The first half of the series is one of the main reasons people are put off by the show/drop it. It starts out slowly with a comedy slice of life type of undertone with a sci-fi mystery twist, but trust me, things change. The first half is completely and utterly necessary in order to understand the characters and to flesh out details and foreshadow events. In the VN they also delve into the physics behind time travel and since I'm a total nerd, I gobbled that shit up.
**Characters (9.5/10)**
I'm going to be completely honest and say that there are certain tropes/archetypes used in this show, but the reason that it works is because they eventually all break through their enclosed personalities and are necessary to the plot in order for the show to advance. There are about 9 characters that you need to know and since it involves time travel where the story resets, some characters are cut development, but that's the whole point of the story, to see how the main character changes despite no one else changing.
I also identify extremely closely with the main character and he's one of the most unique and fleshed out characters in all of anime by the end of the series, so you will probably like him in one way or another. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the main character, it's only the secondary characters that people may not like for reasons.
One of the secondary characters is trans and they don't constantly tease her/him about it and use her/him as other's comedic punching bag and fanservice reveal bait. We actually get to see this person's inner struggle. Huge props to Nitroplus for that.
**Sound (10/10)**
Pretty much flawless. The OP is amazing, the sad songs are amazing, the upbeat songs are amazing, and the sub is especially amazing. Okabe's Japanese voice actor is fantastic, as are most of the other characters.
The show also knows how to use silence to intensify the scene. When shit starts getting intense sometimes all sound will stop so you can truly focus on what is going on. This is one of the problems I had with Clannad, when the show wanted to make you sad, they played pretty music to go along and it made it feel less intense and emotional and more ""Aww, that's really sad"" in a non-harrowing way.
**Art/Animation (8/10)**
Probably the weakest aspect of the show, but if you consider an 8 bad, I don't know what to tell you. The show wasn't funded as much as they would like, so they couldn't pull out all the stops that the VN did. The VN looks pretty amazing. The anime looks good, especially for 2011, they use a gray palette, and the art/animation is very realistic, which I strongly like. They don't cut corners, but it never blows you away. There are a few scenes where you can tell they tried very hard to make it look nice (and succeeded), but it's no Fate/Zero. That being said, it is very consistent throughout and is by no means bad.
**Personal Enjoyment (10/10)**
Absolutely my favorite anime of all time. It is by no means perfect, but it perfectly appeals to me in a way not many other shows have ever done. I was never bored or even considering dropping it at any time and I was thoroughly hooked throughout the show, and if that isn't good enough recommendation, I don't know what is.
**Overall (10/10)**
I place heavy emphasis on personal enjoyment, so they weighs out all of the less than perfect aspects of the show to give Steins;Gate a 10/10. Please, do yourself a favor, watch Steins;Gate.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is crammed with internet culture, memes and easy/attractive female protagonists. A better name for this show would be Waifu;Gate and it's an anime that pads time with the sound of cicadas.
Even if you manage to put aside the many ludicrous contradictions, thanks to a setting who's premise is time travel, you still run into other issues.
At one point there are several attractive women sharing a single room with two other men. These characters are between sixteen and nineteen years old. How is every single character, except the landlord, a virgin. My only guess is to relate/pander to the target audience.
Let's double down and also
                  put aside the unbelievable characters. 
Half way through the series something bad happens and the protagonist tries again and again to stop it by traveling back in time. This touches on the worthwhile concept of fate. He repeats this process hundreds of times over the course of several episodes.
Put that into perspective. We watch the protagonist do the same thing over and over for several episodes straight. It wastes our time.
When he's finished he then has to undo everything he did leading up to said repetition. The next several episodes are a complete inverse of episodes we've already seen; so we already know how each of them will end.  It's more wasted time. Everything that happened could have been compressed into twelve episodes. 
Ultimately Steins;Gate is a love story where the climax is a first kiss between two adults.",1
"
                     Steins;Gate does something many movies, cartoons, and animes try to do. To create an effective and powerful as well a logical time travel based story. In all honesty two things make Steins;Gate great, plot and character chemistry. In my belief nothing else really stands out. A story focused and based around time travel can be very hard. To make a good one you must prioritize plot above anything else. Steins;Gate's plot and logic are very well done it is an anime that almost needs you to pay full attention. 
  Steins;Gate is most important at least
                  in my opinion in the first half. In this first half this is where the main character as well as the rest of the characters discover and make all the problems that must my solved in the second half. This rough cut up of the anime can be what I can determine an accurate and effective way to cut up the plot and the anime. To explain more the first half is more comedy, has the cast in higher spirits, and still trying to determine the mechanics of time travel. The second half is trying to solve the situation that the main character Okabe Rintarou ultimately puts his friends into without knowing. 
    Character chemistry is probably the object which helps the people connect and associate the story and the cast. The cast in of itself isn't impressive, it has many arc stereotypes. For example, an otaku, a maid, a shrine maiden, a childhood friend, a tsundere,an soldier, and a kuudere. The Okabe Rintarou is the only one that isn't based on such a strong arc stereotype. However, this anime is very good at hiding that fact by creating interactions and ways each member relates with each other in a very humorous and human like interactions which can easily distract your mind away from this obvious character design. 
    There is a problem with this chemistry that the anime does very well. This chemistry that the anime displays very well, focuses on more characters to carry this element and therefore favors some characters over others. Which in the long run made me dislike many characters because of the lack of development compared to others. 
    Next I will move on to the animation which isn't that amazing but isn't bad in any possible way. Though I does diverge from the typical high school setting and at one point there is a huge change in setting it isn't anything that can really catch your eye and call it amazing. There isn't much action, and as I have mentioned before the plot and the character chemistry is the strongest points in this anime. 
    Sound isn't very noticeable at all except for the OP and ED which are very good. There really isn't any sound that is really worth mentioning. The anime is very silent though not very slow especially in the second half, I enjoy the fact that it is very quiet throughout most of the anime. I think it adds immersion greatly and helps add personality to the anime all together. 
      Some more issues I have with the anime is Faris, the last two episodes, and episode 18. Faris is probably my most hated character in the anime because she is just there for Daru the otaku and doesn't hold much else in terms of the plot. She is annoying and very mischievous as well as nosy. She also forces herself onto Okabe to BE a part of the problem in essence. The last two episodes were really poorly done as it's very abrupt and fast to turn the dynamics of the anime entirely around. Sure it sorta fits perfectly with the main character as he is very selfish in the anime, trying to go to his ideal world while stripping away other peoples desires but it was so very abrupt it felt wrong. There were even different OP's and ED's to show that these two episodes will sorta change everything.
      Now episode 18 is my least favorite episode. Once again Okabe has to do something in order to reach his goal. He does something so ridiculous in the entire anime that it is more downright wrong than the last two episodes. It makes me angry and it really isn't needed other than covering what ifs in your mind. Besides it's more fan service based and pointless after its over. 
     I enjoyed this anime greatly and sure there may be more aspects to cover but I felt like I covered the most important aspects. Excuse any grammatical errors or possible misspells. I could be more thorough however, I believe for this review I is just important to cover essentials and nothing more as it may compromise my review. Overall I give this anime a 9 it has problems as I stated but they aren't too noticeable and by no means in my belief will harm your experience. It's good by all means and anything above that is up to you to decide.",9

                Have you ever admired a TV show or a movie that you wish you could erase your memories to experience it once again? Steins;Gate is one of those anime series that comes around once in a blue moon, its amazing hook factor coupled with its well fleshed out and engaging characters makes it as one of the most thrilling science fiction stories of the modern era.
Steins;Gate follows the chronicle of Rintarou Okabe, the self-proclaimed mad scientist who prefers to go by the name ""Hououin Kyouma"", serving as the leader of the so-called ""Future Gadget Laboratory"". One day he accidentally invented a time machine in
                  a form of a microwave that can send short e-mails to the past in which they later name as ""D-mails"". Successful D-mails that alters the past shall trigger a ""Reading Steiner"" effect and the world line will change depending on the gravity of the sent D-mail and Okabe is the only one who can observe the shift of world lines. Alongside Okabe, is the hardcore otaku, Daru, his childhood best friend, Mayuri, genius tsundere, Makise Kurisu, and with them along their journey are a supporting cast of characters that would become much more important than what they lead on to be later on down the road.
The first arc of the show deals with the experimentation of the time machine, introducing us how sending D-mails to the past affects the present day as Okabe observes the drastic changes of the world around him. The pacing of the first arc is intended to be slow to capture the unawareness of what is fated to happen from their exploits. Once it hits the stride, the tone and atmosphere completely shifts and along those changes is Okabe's character. 
Steins;Gate is a story about time travel on the surface but it's actually about the ill effects of it. The sacrifices that Okabe endured along the way are painful to watch, so much so that we would eventually empathize with his many struggles episode by episode. As a viewer we'll get this uneasy feeling of resisting against time itself but at the same time feeling powerless as time ticks away slowly. That feeling is neither a joyful or a sorrowful, but as a bittersweet nostalgic one, it's the pain that many of the characters must go through knowing that they must make sacrifices to their cherished memories together as friends. Okabe's life through friendship, emotion and the painful consequences of his decisions would deeply resonate with us further on even after finishing the series and that is an experience we rarely encounter. 
After experiencing a story like this, it is no wonder why people heralded the series as one of the best of all-time. It has outstanding characters which you can't help but come to care about and a uniquely complex time travel system which draws you into the story more. Add to these elements a plot that is equal parts intense and heartwarming then you have a modern sci-fi thriller in your hand. If you want an inspiring chronicle that centers around time travel, then you must check out Steins;Gate.",10

                *SPOILER FREE REVIEW*
I recently finished Steins;Gate and it has easily become one my favourite anime.
Now this anime was a tough one for me because I'm more of a fan of action anime and to be honest, two years ago I watched Steins;Gate till the 12th episode and dropped because I kept looking for the my type of genre in it and didn't pay attention to the story at all. I must have been pretty stupid back then but I think I didn't really understand what was going on so I just dropped it. Now after two years, I decided to watch it again from 
                  starting, because there had to be a reason why it is considered as one of the best masterpieces of all time. And boy was I lucky enough to watch it again, I watched it with full attention still didn't understand the first episode but even then decided to watch next few episodes because I was having fun watching it and it turned out to be great.
Now lets get to the point. [Story] 10/10
Okabe Rintarou is Uni First year student and spends his time doing experiments with his friends in his lab just because he is the ""Mad Scientist, Houin Kyouma~"" (*In Okabe's voice). While conducting his experiments, he creates something unbelieveable which leads to a series of events and that is just a brief insight of the story.
The story might not seem a complete 10 at first because to fully understand it, you are required to watch the whole series but nevertheless, I liked it from the beginning because who doesn't likes time machine and stuff. It seems like a typical slice of life with nice mix of comedy along with a spice of madness at first but opinions change overtime. The first few episodes are called ""slow"" by many people just because they are the introductry episodes and it leaves a lot of dots to be connected but they were really enjoyable. Now why is this series regarded as a masterpiece? But first what makes a masterpeice? In my opinion for an anime to be a masterpeice it requires a unique and interesting plot and characters, a great execution of story, a MC who was goals bigger than you think and a dramatic ending or an ending that leaves you in an utter state of amazament. Well Stein;Gate has a story that is perfectly executed, there is a nice touch of comedy and romance, the characters are so interesting and unique with their own traits and the ending is one of the best so far. The pacing of story is great and when those unconnected dots start to connect, you just have no option but to be amazed. Starting from somewhere around episode 7-10, each episode will leave you mind blown and you will be sitting in your seat thinking how and what just happened without getting into any sort of confusion. Even though the concept of time travel is a bit out of ordinary and confusing, Steins;Gate manages to explain the story very well without getting the viewers bored.
[Art]  8.5/10
Not much to say about the animation as it wasn't really required but the artwork was great. The background scenes was just beautiful especially whenever there was a mad scientist laugh. I loved the charcater designs, one the uniquest I've ever seen and everything was detailed. Altought Steins;Gate isn't the best in the art department, the art style matches perfectly to the theme of the anime.
[Sound]  9.5/10
Openings and ending were no doubt great but the voice acting and osts were on a completely different level. Well that has to be expected as two of the best voice actors were there. Okabes voice acting was pure awesomeness, especially the ""Engrish"". Similarly Mayushi's voice actor did a really great job and Cristina~ (*In Okabes Voice*) has a perfect Tsundere voice. Everyone just had a distinct voice, even Mr. Brauns daughter. The osts were great, especially in the last few episodes. Without the great voice acting, the anime wouldn't have been that must fun to watch.
[Characters] 10/10
A perfect 10. I think this is the only anime which has two characters on my favourite characters list (at the time of writing this). Starting with Okabe,  (suffering from 8th grade syndrome), his character was just awesome. He was funny, at times serious, but nevertheless he was a mad scientist. Through out the series, he had a great character developement and at times you could feel sorry for him trying to undo what he had done. Makise's characters was just as just as great. A bit of tsundereness and intelligence but she was really supportive as well as kind, and has her funny moments and thats what made her so great. Mayushi's character was also great, a bit lonely at times but cheerful. Tuturuu~. Daru was your everyday Otaku pervert but he was a ""Supa Hakah"". There was a trap character, a nyan character, silent type and a soldier. A variety of characters, don't you think but each had a great role. (P.S: I ship Obake and Makise so hard so let my ship sail).
[Enjoyment] 10/10
It is difficult to get into the anime in the first few episodes if you are not much of a Sci-Fi fan but once you start get going its difficult to stop yourself even if you try to. It had a perfect balance of everything and had cliffhangers that could hypnotize you into clicking the next episode button. Every aspect of the anime contributes to making it as enjoyable as possible which includes great story and plot, nice artwork, outstanding voice acting on some of the most outstanding set of characters and osts that suited the theme of the anime.
[Overall] 10/10
Steins;Gate is a masterpiece at heart. It doesn't matter what genre you like, once you get into it, you will like it. Do I think that it is worthy of all the praise and its over the top rating? Yes, without a doubt and to find out why, you will have to watch this great series. I hope that anyone who hasn't watched it yet will give it atleast a try, after watching this review.

                So, Steins;Gate. Probably the most blatant abuse of the semicolon ever borne out of Japan (because that particular offense is so ubiquitous, hardy har). Your friend Jeanie the otaku/weaboo has most likely recommended this to you at some point, and you've nodded your head inattentively and added it to the pile of shows that she's said will change your life and that you KNOW you're going to get to eventually (including but not limited to Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop, Akira, a Ghibli film, and like 2 shonen things).
Let me reaffirm Jeanie's gushing recommendation: you've got to got to GOT TO get to Steins;Gate. 
The first
                  ten episodes will feel like a slog. I realize that's not exactly helping this work of art enter your good graces, but bear with me. There are no filler episodes in this anime, and every episode contains at least 2.34 plot points that become crucial elements in the show later on. The show runners used as much time as they possibly could to meticulously and slowly build this world to make the ensuing drama as rewarding an experience as possible for you. THEY DID THIS FOR YOU.
I hate summarizing plot in reviews, and I feel like the best way to go into this one is with a blindfold and a poking stick. I will say that if you like sci-fi, slice of life, romance, action, drama, and damn good writing in your anime, you're going to love Steins;Gate. The reason the show has reached such a high level of popularity is because it's got a little something for everyone, and it still achieves a level of originality that most anime in this day and age just can't seem to reach (IMO, sorry bros). 
When it comes to the more objective side of things, i.e. music, art, characters, yadda, the show is very well done. You don't have a crap load of tropes with arms and legs, which does soooo much to help the viewer empathize with the characters' plight. The animation is spot on 99% of the time, the soundtrack is lovely, and the tone shifts from comedic to dark seamlessly and appropriately. Steins;Gate has personality, and I will reiterate by comparing its personality to ranch dressing on romaine lettuce.
I just finished the show about twenty minutes ago, went to the bathroom, then wrote this review. It's all over the place, I know. But hopefully I've given you a little more incentive to please your anime connoisseur friend Jeanie and watch this darned-good piece of work.",10
"
                I almost dropped this anime, but a lot of my friends tell me not to, and I really glad that I do as they said.
Story: Stein Gate is one of the best anime that has best plot I ever watch (eventhought my completed anime list not as much as yours maybe, but still doesn't change the fact. Begin with slow pacing and confusing initial eps (that's why I almost dropped it), but after forced my self to watch more and more eps, I found an interesting point, the story development is really attract me. And I have to state that the ending was flawless.
Art and
                  Sound: Chara design are so well made and perfectly matched their personalites, so is with the seiyuu voice.
Enjoyment: Although I almost dropped this series, I really found my self enjoying the entire show afterall. Some Romance with (light) harem touch are entertain me, and what makes it better is there's a bunch of absurd behavior and a litte bit of ecchi contained, it always makes me laugh loudly.
Overall: I love this anime, and as I said I really glad to finish it, thanks to all my friends for that. I highly recommended Stein Gate to whoever seek for epic story development.",9

                Steins;Gate: Quriky.
This anime is a hard one to get into.  I'd say the first 6-10 episodes are confusing, and certainly the first one isn't an attention grabber.  In fact, after the first episode you'll be left damn confused.
I'd heard a lot of good things about this anime.  It's a hard one to judge.  The ending is certainly satisfying.  The strength of this anime lies in its characters.  They're enjoyable, funny and interesting.  This strength is also in a similar series, Robotics;Notes (presuming it's by the same author), but Steins;gate carries the plot much better than does RN. 
                  But it's not really for the plot that you'll be watching - the plot just happens to be the medium through which one enjoys the characters and the interplay between them.  They're original.
At times the series offers up some suspense that'll keep you on your toes - and after the first half you'll definitely want to finish.  If you get there.  But I'd encourage you to push through as it does tend to make more sense the further you go.
There is a light-heartedness about the series which is most enjoyable.  Tension is built between the interplay of the quite extravagant and dire plot combined with the quirky tone.  At times I'm not sure if it works, because as the viewer the anime reads like a sci-fi thriller but plays out like a comedy.  It kind of squeezes into both categories, but doesn't quite meet either.  It is a stab at something new I'd say in both genres, and as in RN, SG gives the viewer some very original characters to remember.  You'll find yourself mimicking Hououin Kyouma's maniacal mad-scientist laugh after watching this one.  He really carries the series through with his bizarre names for all of his weird experiments.  My favourite has to be reading-steiner.  The dialogue between the characters is witty and it maintains your engagement, otherwise you'd probably give up and rue the wasted bandwidth.
S;G doesn't deliver as a genuine time-travel sci-fi.  There are some twists, which are mostly believable as long as you don't think about them too much.  The art is fantastic, polished.  Sometimes the outfits of the characters gets repetitive, but that's easily overlooked.  This is a NICE anime that'll leave you with warm-fuzzies at the end.  Don't go in with high expectations.  It's an odd one to categorize.  I wouldn't give it below a 6, but I'd be hard pressed to give it anything above a 7.
Give it a go.  It's enjoyable.",7

                No spoilers here
Sorry for bad english
A fantastic show, absolutely the best Anime you can find, comparable only to absolute masterpieces like Deathnote or AOT. I find the criticisms below really childish, written by people who don't know how to enjoy a story without opening their mouths.
The story contains incredible refinements that leave you breathless.
The characters are perfect and have an incredible and exciting characterization.
The story draws the viewer into an abyss of despair along with the protagonist who leaves you speechless and from whom, of course, only the great mad scientist Hououin Kyouma can go out, bringing with him all his friends and his Kurisu.

                It started out real sluggish for me for the first 10 episodes or something. ""This anime has a ridiculously high rating and it will actually get good"" - I kept that in mind as I venture to the next episode.
As I eventually made it to the second half through a fierce struggle, I whimpered ""Sh*t just about to get real~"" The atmosphere became darker. A lot of plot twists happened. There were things I never expected to happen, happened. As a matter of fact, the climax nearly brought tears to my eyes.
I was thinking about not giving this anime a perfect score of 10/10 because
                  I am not quite fond of its art style but the moe characters especially Feyris-nyan, actually wins. m/
All in all, it was a really really really amazeballs fantabulous anime. I never thought I would love sci-fi anime so much it hurts. This anime also turned out to be one of my favorites. If you're a basic anime fan you might find this anime a little dull, but if you're a self-proclaimed mad otaku, you should totally give this anime a shot!! The first couple episodes might bore and confuse you but trust me it would actually be worth watching. I can't wait for the movie to come this April!! El.Psy.Congroo.~",10

                Steins;Gate is my favorite show in a season full of great shows.  There's not really any 'action' in the classic shounen fighting style, being driven almost entirely by dialogue and character interactions.  The story is a strange one that from the first episode shows the signs of time travel and alternate universes, possibly caused by the self-professed mad scientist's 'Phone Microwave.' The highlight of the series so far is the interactions between Hokarin and 'Christina', the genius girl he takes on as an unwilling assistant.  The story has been a little slow in developing, but hopefully when things start happening they'll come
                  fast and furious.

                This is my first review, and I figured I'd pick this series because it dealt with Heideggerian existentialism - a topic I'm fairly well-versed and well-read in. This series also has a profound level of depth and character/plot development. 
One of the re-occuring quotes by Heidegger in this series was ""humans are essentially temporal beings"". Contrary to what you might think, this quote was not vaguely incorporated into the plot, rather, it touches upon one of the main elements of this series - time and the inevitability of it. Unlike Jean-Paul Sartre, who thought that human-existence is detached and separate from (and also precedes) essential
                  qualities (such as time), Heidegger thought that existence is involved in the world of essence, bound to it, to use Heideggers words from ""Being and Time"", he thought we are ""thrown into the world"". For Heidegger, time is merely a product of this, however, that isn't to say we can't alter it. Heidegger thought human-beings, as Dasein (or the ontological phenomenon of ""being-there"") and as something that exists relationally (or in relation to the world), are capable of utilization and ultimately creativity. He thought this capacity would enable transcendence through technological development - a post-humanist theme thoroughly addressed by this series. 
In ""Steins;Gate"", the story is centred around Rintarou Okabe, a first-year university student/self-proclaimed ""mad scientist"" who refers to himself by the name of  ""Hououin Kyouma"". Okabe's character was very unique, unlike the usual, mainstream, mindless male protagonist. He was a free-spirit and an explorer of possibilities. He also had a sense of humour, which occasionally provided comic relief after the tragic moments of this series. And yes, there are tragic moments in this show, which, in their level of development and the in rawness of the emotions portrayed, make it all the more worth the watch (if you can handle tragedy that is). I should also mention, Okabe displays a very realistic capacity for emotion, transitioning from content (if not maniacally ecstatic) to upset in a very smooth and relevant manner. 
Okabe fights the theoretical battle against time. This goes back to what I said about Heidegger and Okabe's free-thinking tendencies. In his pursuits and endeavours as a ""mad scientist"", Okabe tries to alter time. Initially he does this out of his bloated ego and the persona he has developed for himself, however, Okabe eventually has to come to terms with the grave, temporal consequences of his actions. Okabe has to struggle against his fate, trying to find his ideal destined outcome. In this struggle, this show presents an interesting depiction of the debate between indeterminists and determinists (mainly, fatalists). It also reaches an interesting Heidegerrian, compatibilist conclusion, which I've already described above. 
The secondary characters in this series include the following. There's: Shiina Mayuri, a sweet and innocent girl who has been friends with Okabe since childhood; Kurisu Makise, a brilliant and proud scientific scholar who really just wants someone to care about her; and Itaru Hashida, a fat, ""super haxor""/computer-nerd who's perversion also provides occasional comic relief. 
All of the characters in this series had their own, realistic personalities, which were developed smoothly. All of these characters (among many more) had revealing and raw emotional moments. And ultimately, the characters in this series are partially what makes it worth the watch. The only problem that I had was that I found Hashida's overtly-sexual humour to be out of place at points and it pandered to degeneracy in its excessiveness. 
Another enjoyable aspect of this series was the soundtrack. There were many beautiful, melancholic piano tracks which were deployed appropriately. The music in this series provided a sense of warm nostalgia yet cold melancholy. The music alone gives a good sense of the overall nature of this series and its depth. The music in this series also serves as a good way to get a glimpse into the series if you're contemplating whether or not to watch it. As for the animation, I enjoyed the backgrounds and landscapes, I wasn't too fond of the character design.
Overall, I would be eager to purchase the visual novel for ""Steins;Gate"" and am eager to watch the film, which I only recently found out about. I thought the OVA provided a solid resolution and I'm curious to see how the storyline continues. I would definitely recommend watching this series as well as ""Chaos;Head"", which came before it, however, ""Steins;Gate"" outmatches its prequel by far.",9
"
                Steins;Gate and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Those are the only two animes I have ever given a score of 10.
I watch Doctor Who and I have played Bioshock, thus I though nothing could ever come close or even surpass such time travel storytelling quality. However, I was mistaken. Steins;Gate is every bit of awesome as those two. The story is utterly excellent, even though one cannot quite understand it at the beginning. It even quotes Heidegger and refers to Einstein!
The characters are so outstanding that it is impossible (or at least highly improbable) not to become attached to them. Makise Kurisu and Okabe Rintarou are both
                  two of my personal favourite characters of all time.
The art, sound and pace of this anime are stunning as well. I enjoyed it so much that I could not wait for the following episode! Furthermore, I also believe the OVAs and the movie were great additions to the series. They wrap up every plot line in a very satisfying way.
Steins;Gate is the epitome of perfection. It is funny, intelligent, adorable, sweet, and painfully heartbreaking.",10
"
                Steins Gate deserves every bit of the praise the series has gotten since it aired 3 years ago. In my opinion there is no anime that compares to the series. I have been a big fan of time travel stories since Back to the Future (The best time travel trilogy in my opinion) but I went into this anime thinking it would be just another harem comedy with a bit of sci-fi mixed in. I was pleasantly surprised. 
Time travel stories usually leave a lot of holes in explanations leaving the audience dissatisfied. However Steins Gate is one time travel story that has all its
                  bases covered. The story is based on the true events of the internet meme John Titor who claimed to be from the future and who was looking for the IBM 500 in order to save humanity‚Äôs future (google it). When I learned about this fact I was even more impressed with the writers for developing such an interesting plot from a joke someone played on the web. Another thing I liked about the series is that there are three types of time travel. Firstly the D-mail that can be used to shift between world lines, the second Makise‚Äôs time machine which can be used to travel back into time in one world line and last but not the least the time machine from the future that physically transfers people. All this is explained very well in the anime so don‚Äôt worry if it all seems confusing right now.  
The characters are truly jems of the anime world. I fell in love with each member of the ‚ÄúFuture Gadget Lab‚Äù instantly. I had expected the main character to be your typical anime hero, a loser who realizes his potential due to a bizarre event that changes his perspective on life. However I found Okabe Rintarou or Hououin Kyouma as he refers to himself to be the complete opposite of what I had expected. Firstly Okabe stands by what he believes from the first episode to the last. He claims to be a mad scientist and a mad scientist he proves himself to be. Completely disregarding the consequences of his actions to quench his thirst for creating a successful time-machine he continues to develop the D-mail and later the time machine with the help of genius Makise Kurisu and his college buddy Hashida Itaru.  
Makise Kurisu is the perfect counterpart for our mad scientist. Her thirst for achieving success and curiosity about the time machine make her stay at the lab and it is only through her help that Okabe is able to undo his mistakes. Itaru or Daru as he is called by everyone provides some perverted humor but is also a likable character. One of the most loved characters of the anime has to be Shiina, Mayuri our protagonist‚Äôs childhood friend. Just a few episodes in and you will be Tuturuuing with her. She also acts as a sort of anchor for the other three whose goals can sometimes blind them to the realities of their actions. The other supporting actors are just as enjoyable and each has a purpose in the story.   
The main genre for this anime is obviously sci-fi but the series has equal amounts of humor and some romance that develops later on in the series. The artwork is done well in my opinion the visual effects complement the story wonderfully. I would recommend that you watch this anime with the english dub. The dub script is simply wonderful and the exchanges between Okabe and Kurisu are very entertaining and hilarious. 
I have seen this anime eight times till now and have to say I enjoy it more every time I re-watch it. I am sure you will not regret giving your time to this series and will enjoy it as much as I did.",10

                when i turned on steins gate i was hoping for a serious expose on microwaves and time travel; i am currently sticking things into my microwave to see if they pass the time/space mesh and show up in my memories when i was a small person.
ever since i can remember, last week, i have been experimenting with microwaving objects.  when i heard stein had unlocked the secrets to time travel, i knew that all those hours standing very close to the microwave were not just rewarded with a slight head buzz, but also with science.  
as i watched the drama of teenage love,
                  through constant bouts of panic and nihilistic philosophical rants in front of the mirror, I couldn't help but wonder when it was going to break down the proper methodology of sending a frog back in time.  all i could get was a thick black goo all over the place.  
Needless to say it was NOT a documentary.  But I should mention that the red head was actually lilith, the lady in red, who shows up now and again to represent the whore of confusion in modern illuminations.  I would constantly draw a hex for warding and fear not cretens I would also draw protection from the back of my dollar bill from the evil eye.  I could relate to the main character because he was also a mad scientist.
This one time I built a hat that blocked the government from spying on me.",3
"
                When it comes to anime adaptations of visual novels, I would usually recommend you to read the visual novel first, and with ‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù I make no exception. Although this adaptation has some good production value and does perfectly fine at bringing the story to life, it misses some of the finer aspects of the visual novel. In the end though, the content is so rich and exciting on its own, that you can‚Äôt help but finding yourself really enjoying it anyway.
The story centers around the eccentric, self-proclaimed mad scientist, Okabe Rintarou and his crew of lab members, including the scientific prodigy Makise Kurisu. The lab
                  is initially really nothing more than a group of friends goofing around, inventing strange gadgets such as a remote control shaped as a laser gun, or a bamboo-copter with a CCD camera installed. They also have an invention called the ‚Äúmicrowave telephone‚Äù. It functions exactly as a regular microwave oven, except that its timer can be set from a telephone through mail. One day, the group discovers that the microwave telephone has an additional functionality. They realize then, that they have by pure accident created the world‚Äôs first time machine.
The first half of the story introduces the characters and establishes all of the time travel mechanics. It shows the characters spending time experimenting with the microwave telephone in various ways to see what possibilities they now have, since they have gained the ability to alter the future. The organization ‚ÄúSERN‚Äù is established as the villains whom in the future have turned society into a totalitarian nightmare by using time travel of their own.
The second half is about Okabe discovering how all of his time altering extravaganzas have put him and the world on a slow course toward ruin. Now he is on a journey in which he must go back and undo the changes he and his fellow lab members have made, to set right what once went wrong.
Stories that have time travel as their central themes have a tendency to focus very much on the philosophical aspects of time travel, such as paradox theories, fate vs. choice, etc. ‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù has this as well, but it also has something which you don‚Äôt get to see very often, which is a heavy focus on the scientific aspects of time travel. It is interesting to see how much this particular story is rooted in real life. Although there has to be liberties taken (since time travel hasn‚Äôt been invented in real life), it stays very true to how actual time travel is theorized to work. Black holes, light speed travel, space-time geometry, etc. The time travel itself isn‚Äôt the only thing derived from real life. Just looking at some of the names and terms says more than enough. SERN = CERN, IBN 5100 = IBM 5100, Large Hadron Collider = Large Hadron Collider, you get the point. Heck, even John Titor is in this as an actual character! In this story, all of the claims he made on the bulletin boards are true and actually happened. ‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù paints a picture of a world in which everything you could possibly know about time travel in real life, is known here as well. They even make joking references to other time travel stories such as ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù, ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe Girl Who Leapt through Time‚Äù.
Okabe Rintarou is a breath of fresh air from your typical visual novel protagonist in that he is an actual character and not just some generic everyday guy. At times he can be serious, and at other times he is 100% ham. He himself allows the story to go from tragic to hilarious at the drop of a hat. The range of his character reflects the range of the story itself. ‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù lets you experience a little bit of everything. It is funny, and it is sad. It has scope and it has depth. It is intelligent, and it is silly. It even has a surprisingly touching love story.
Now, if I was reviewing the visual novel, I would‚Äôve ended the review right here and given it a score of 10/10. However, this is a review of the anime after all and for that I have to take a few points off. It‚Äôs not that I think this is a bad adaptation (in fact it is a very good one), but the problem I have is with its transition from one medium to another. Having read the visual novel and seen the anime, I feel as though the visual novel medium seemed like a better fit to tell this particular story.
One of the bigger problems I find is how rushed the anime seems, especially when it deals with exposition. In the original visual novel, the writers invested a great amount of time at laying down all of the exposition in the first half of the story so that there would be no confusion later on about say, the mechanics of time travel. That way, they allowed the story to flow fluently in the second half when things were finally starting to get moving. In the anime however, the exposition is glossed over and only mentioned once it becomes relevant to the plot. This creates situations such as Okabe (and the viewers) finding out about world convergence theory after having already seen it. As I had already read the visual novel beforehand, I already knew what was going on, but I can‚Äôt imagine how confusing it would have been otherwise, to suddenly see Okabe repeating time over and over again and yet failing to change the future for no explainable reason, even though it had worked before with the ‚Äúd-mails‚Äù.
In general, exposition is something a good writer would want to avoid, but in certain cases exposition can enhance the story and may even be necessary for it to work, and this is one of those cases. Okabe‚Äôs back and forth conversations with John Titor, and his meetings with the other lab members are in there for a reason. They serve to lay down the foundation for everything that is to come later on. In the anime, these scenes go by way too fast for anyone to actually be able to digest all of it. Instead, you only get a somewhat superficial summary that only covers enough for the story to be able to carry on.
The non-exposition parts are pretty hasty as well. Some parts don‚Äôt carry nearly the same emotional weight as their visual novel counterparts simply because they go by too fast, hence removing the suspense (anything involving Moeka, Dr.Nakabachi‚Äôs fight scene etc). Then, there are things that should be a big deal but their importance somehow got lost on the way (The entire John Titor character for example).
‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù is probably one of those stories that are more fit for reading, rather than watching, if only for having more ‚Äúmeat‚Äù. If you have watched the anime but haven‚Äôt read the visual novel, you should probably give that one a try, because to me, it tells the story in what seems more like the way the story was supposed to be told. Everything flows together more fluently, the exposition is handled better, its direction is a lot clearer, and it is much more suspenseful and exciting. Despite all of this though, the anime is very enjoyable if seen for what it is, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested.",8

                Story: 8/10
Steins Gate is about the emotional outcomes that occur due to the actions from our main character (the mad scientist, Okabe). This anime not only shows how a human can be powerless in certain situations, but how the one specific action can create various effects. Steins Gate also shows how determination can achieve the goals wanted. Most of the anime is about character development and how they go through different hardships to get to their final states. It brings a lot of emotional feelings into the anime through romance between the main characters. 
Steins Gate also has many side stories with different supporting characters.
                  They, not only have separate personalities, but were given indepth background. It allows the viewer to not only feel for the main characters, but for the supporting characters as well (which does not happen often).
Steins Gate focuses much on the science aspect of the 'microwave' created and how it can affect the general world. One down side (in my opinion) is how the plot line gets a bit boring and dull as the anime goes forward; however, the few ending episodes make up for most of that. The anime certainly doesn't feel rushed and it does show all the personalities of each character.
Art: 8/10
I loved the art because the characters actually showed their emotions most of the times. It not only showed their happiness, but their sadness during critical points of the anime. 
However, the characters usually dress the same (except for one or two episodes). This is probably one downside of it.
Sound: 9/10
I loved the music of Steins Gate. The opening and ending themes were sung well! The emotional soundtracks given during the depressing times were also broadcasted well. It made the viewer feel more emotional and 'into' the moment of the anime.
Character: 9/10
I loved how the various characters of Steins Gate have different personalities and how each of them thought differently. Obake, that is the mad scientist, really showed his personality well throughout the anime. It also showed how he develops as a person as a whole through the different people he meets as the story goes on.
I also loved how even the side supporting characters' personalities were shown well. It not only gave life in each of the characters, but also allowed the viewer to feel the moment during the encounters they make with the main character.
Enjoyment: 10/10
I enjoyed the anime because of the great character development and how the main character progresses into the person he is. It not only shows his hardships, but how he tries to manage his situation during each episode. It allows the viewer to see everything in his point of view through a span of a few episodes.
Overall: 9/10
I loved the anime. I would recommend this to anyone who likes romance stories and thrillers, because everything starts unraveling in the middle of the series.",9
"
                Letho72 on /r/anime put this across very well, and I quote:
""I agree with S;G. Well, it's not in my least favorites, but it was just acceptable to watch.
The ending was pretty good, would have liked a whole show like that. But the first 15ish episodes were just so slow and boring, it was like a SoL except they didn't give me any characterization and the ""oh look Okabe is chunni!"" joke got old after episode 2. So I'm left here with 15+ episodes of cringe where I still don't know anything meaningful about the cast.
And then the ending happens and I'm suddenly supposed to care
                  about everyone. And people always tell me 'but the ending!!"" Yeah, it was good. That doesn't change the fact that I had to sit through 2/3 of a boring show just for a cool climax. The ending doesn't justify how poorly done the rest of the show is.""",4
"
                Steins;Gate is a fascinating anime with a different take on time travel than other shows and movies. Where Steins;Gate really shines is in its story and character development.
The story starts off a little slow, but has a good amount of comedy and references that keep it interesting until the ""time machine"" has been fully developed. At this point, the story really takes off and becomes very serious at times, while still bringing up some humor and references to keep the show and the characters from becoming too depressing.
Steins;Gate does very well in character development, particularly in the main character Rintarou Okabe. At first, Okabe was
                  a rather obnoxious character who did not take the morals behind time travel seriously, only looking at it with curiosity. Over the course of the story, however, Okabe's experiences with time travel really change his attitude towards his friends and really his overall demeanor. Okabe's development really made his story worth telling and sympathies for his plight are well deserved.
My only problem with the characters in Steins;Gate is that not many of the other characters go through much change, which makes sense because they are not time traveling like Okabe, but I would like to have seen a little more backstory for Makise Kurisu and Mayuri Shiina and more character development for Itaru Hashida. I did like the bits and pieces of backstory given about the other side characters which made their problems seem just as important and Okabe's, making his decisions all the more difficult and showing how admirable he was in the past and present.
Steins;Gate has very good animation and sound, but these are not the focal points of the show. There is very little action sequences or many superb animation scenes, but that really fits with the story and the show and makes it seem all the more realistic. The soundtrack did a very good job of lightening the mood when necessary and making emotional scenes more emotional, but there are only a few soundtracks that are really exceptional. I do have to say that Steins;Gate has one of my favorite openings.
I recommend Steins;Gate to anyone looking for a really enjoyable plot with a set of very diverse and interesting characters. While not without flaws, Steins;Gate does present a new story with a very satisfying development and conclusion.",9

Watching Steins; Gate will emotionally impact you. This, I can guarantee, and though the magnitude of the experience varies, you will feel it.  You can sleep through series thrown your way by randoms who constantly scream about feels and tears, and I'm sure many of you, including myself, are guilty. 
                  But sitting through this truly beautiful and sometimes heart-wrenching journey while feeling nothing is an accomplishment outside my reach.  The only regret I can take away after finishing that last episode is the bothersome truth that I didn't choose to watch it sooner.
Story -  Arguably one of the easiest 10's I have ever given.  Time-travel is an incredibly risky foundation to build a story on; delivering a logical, powerful plot on said subject means to succeed in an area where countless failures have, and continue to disappoint.  Steins; Gate accomplished this and more.
Characters - Again, another easy 10.  An incredible amount of depth and uniqueness resides in every single character, whether you like them or not.  To me, the mark of amazing characters reveals itself in how emotionally invested you become as the series progresses.  
Okabe Rintarou, a seemingly insane scientist overflowing with eccentricity and completely ignorant to the feelings of those around him, yet quite intelligent and caring, even heroic on occasion.   Makise Kurise, a calm, collected, and mature young woman on the outside who, in reality, still possesses the childish curiosity that often compromises that adult-like facade.  You'll wish that they were real by the story's end.  At least, I did.  That was the level of connection Steins; Gate established between myself and its truly amusing characters.  Exceedingly rare, and even more enjoyable.
Sound/Art - 10.  I don't really possess the fine ear/eye that some critics have for this.  Yet, for the time that this series was produced, the animation and soundtracks, everything was phenomenal.  It just adds onto the enjoyment.  Speaking of which...
Enjoyment - 11.  This is the most amazing time-travel tale I've ever had the pleasure of discovering.  This is the most amazing anime, in my humble opinion, that I've yet to see so far.  Some series focus too much on tangible features and leave no emotional imprint on its audience, like any B-rated action movie starring Tom Cruise.  Some series focus so much on making the audience cry that realistic, believable aspects of the story are neglected, ruining the entire work itself.  Steins; Gate has nailed the perfect balance in a way I have never seen before.  
Watch it.  If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund in Dr. Pepper.  
You'll understand",10
"
                I really don't understand why this is the third highest rated anime. 
For me, this anime was a chore to get through. The majority of the plot twists in the series I figured out ahead of time and the few I didn't weren't resounding. 
The way Okabe goes in this giant round about way to solve his problems when a much simpler solution is staring him in the face since he has control over the machine freaking infuriated me. He has so many simpler solutions to nearly every issue he comes across but he was too stupid to see them and that completely destroyed all
                  enjoyment for me. 
I'd like to go into greater detail, but that would spoil the so called twists and ruin it for some so I won't.
Had I not watched this all in one sitting, I would have dropped it by the third episode because while I've watched dialogue heavy anime in the past and really enjoyed it, they had awesome soundtracks to back up boring dialogue which makes a world of difference to me.",6

                ""No one knows what the future holds. It has infinite potential."" - Rintarou Okabe
""I told you I'm not Cristina, and I'm not your assistant."" - Kurisu Makise
The hardest thing about writing a good time travel story is defining the rules of your universe (or multiverse, as the case may be), how your time travel affects your universe, and what limits your time machine has. Without this solid set of rules, it is more than a little easy to confuse the average viewer and annoy the overcritical among us (in which group I myself am included) who are quick to point out how the elements of
                  the story do not make sense.
In Steins;Gate, however, all of the rules are well defined‚Äîdown to how many letters can be sent in an email to the past as well as the extent to which time travel (quantum leaping if you will) is possible.
But perhaps the most interesting concept of Steins;Gate is the idea that there are unchangeable core realities (which switching between is nearly impossible). Preventing the rise of anime culture in Akihabara or sending yourself the winning lotto numbers is possible, but key moments in the timeline‚Äîlike the death of certain individuals or society's eventual turn into a dystopia‚Äîare not.
When I started watching Steins;Gate, I worried that, like the first half of Robotics;Notes, the story would feel thematically schizophrenic as it tried to tie together all the game‚Äôs romance plots into one single story. Instead, each character-specific plot in Steins;Gate was given an episode in the first half and an episode in the second half of the series to resolve itself‚Äîwhich worked well within the time loop narrative.
The problem with time loop stories is that they can be boring and repetitive‚Äî(see Haruhi‚Äôs ‚ÄúEndless 8‚Äù for an example of such). The trick is to make each time loop different yet recognizable enough to keep it interesting. In Steins;Gate, the latter half of the story deals with one such time loop. The same events are always happening in the background, giving the viewer subtle clues about how close it is until the end of the loop.
The story also shows in great depth the effects of such a time loop upon the average human‚Äîespecially one with such a grizzly conclusion. Okabe, the main character, sees the death of a friend countless times. It both breaks his heart and hardens his soul as he experiences this torture countless times. And if it weren't for the support of those around him, it's clear he would have eventually succumbed to either sorrow or apathy.
When it all comes down to it, Steins;Gate is the story of a man forced to make an impossible choice. He not only must chose between the two women he loves but also must chose which one of them lives while the other dies. The result is pure, well written drama as he tries to find a way around choosing‚Äîhunting for a loophole to let them both live. In the end, though, he fails and at last chooses, ending the life of one of the women he loves. The result is a beautiful piece of tragic storytelling, guaranteed to rock even the most jaded hearts with the powerful emotion it evokes.
Of course, this is more than a little undercut by the final ending where, after he chooses and she thus dies, he is given a loophole to save the woman he sacrificed to fate. Don't get me wrong, if any character in fiction deserves a happy ending, it is Okabe. However, by trying to have both its tragic ending and its happy ending, the former loses more than a little of its emotional power.
Is Steins;Gate really the story of a man who accidentally invents time travel or is it instead the story of a paranoid schizophrenic who has a psychotic break?
Okabe has more than a few schizophrenic symptoms: He talks to imaginary people on his cell phone and constantly rants about a secret organization that only he can defeat. Before the start of the story, he has no family support and exactly two friends‚Äîone of which seems largely unable to understand the world around her.
Perhaps instead of a time travel story, Okabe experienced a psychotic break upon discovering Kurisu's body in the first episode. Thus his mind escaped into a world of his own creation where not only was the girl not dead, but also was his friend and confidant. Then slowly but surely, he built this fantasy into a paradise world in his mind where he is fighting a secret organization bent on world domination‚Äîas per his former delusions‚Äîalongside an ever-growing cast of friends and allies.
Then, one night Mayuri died in the real world, shattering the dream. From that point on, he became driven to restore his fantasy world to the utopia it had been, only for the real world to bleed through‚Äîending with Mayuri‚Äôs death over and over.
I‚Äôm not speaking in hyperbole when I say that Steins;Gate might be the best anime I have ever seen. It is well constructed and emotionally resonant. Moreover, it is pretty much the perfect time travel story with the concepts it explores and the world it builds. I recommend this anime to absolutely anyone who is even remotely interested after reading this review. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.",10
"
                Steins Gate was an anime I was skeptical about for the longest time, it seemed like something I wouldn't like and it seemed to lack any bit of originality. I love being wrong, not only did I enjoy myself the entire time, but I also wasn't able to find any flaws with anything in it. It is a masterpiece of an anime and I can understand now why it is held in such high regard by many people. 
Story- The story is about Okabe the mad scientist and his friends adventures upon discovering they have made a time machine out of a microwave, but it's
                  quite a bit more than that. There is so much depth to not only the story but the characters in Steins;Gate that it's kind of insane. Since it's about time travel the slightest change can make things spin out of control drastically and that's where most of the story happens. At first it might seem like a comedy, which it is and it actually has some really good comedy in it, but it does get a lot more serious later down the line after a certain event happens. I'm glad that they were able to make it a bit more serious while also keeping the comedy in there. It does comedy and mystery extremely well. 
    But wait, there's more. Not anywhere does it mention this, but it also has a very romantic side to it, I would even argue that's it's a romantic comedy in disguise, which is a good thing. It has great comedy, a well thought out story that stays interesting the entire time as well as having really emotional scenes that tear at your heart strings while the characters still stay in character. It also has one of the most satisfying endings I've ever watched. To me it seems like too many animes coming out recently are almost scared of actually ending the story so they give you a half ending just in case they want to milk the viewers some more and come out with a dragged out second season which will also probably end on a rather bad note. Not here though, everything is wrapped up rather nicely and I was extremely happy to have spent my time watching it. 
Art- The art style is pretty normal and rather simplistic in steins;gate, which is the way it should be. The animation and art-style is all really smooth and high quality and there are some scenes that are done extremely well and are really stylistic, but for the most part it's above average and regular. Those few stylistic scenes really do add a lot to it though and are very memorable.
Sound- The intro to steins;gate is amazing, so are the endings. Most intros/endings I shrug off and forget, but I have a feeling that I will remember steins;gate for a really long time, I just don't see myself being able to forget them because they were so good and well done. The soundtrack and musical ques are equally as good as well, it's a very atmospheric anime and certain segments in the anime are reminiscent of the ""other world"" scenes in clannad, which I definitely did not expect from this.
   I would also like to talk about the english dub. I'm the kind of guy that just ignores english dubs all together mainly because it's usually a lesser version than the japanese dub, but not for steins;gate. I haven't even heard the japanese voices, but I don't see how they could be better than the english voices. The voice actors nailed their characters spot on and it was kind of amazing. Okabe sounded like a mad scientist and Mayuri's voice actress nailed the cutesy Japanese girl quite well. Everybody else also nailed their rolls, but those two stuck out the most to me.
Character- Usually in most animes you find out mostly about the main character and maybe have one small segment about one of the more important side characters, but that's it. Not in steins;gate. You get involved in every character that appears on screen for at least 1 or even 2 episodes worth of story, which to me was kind of amazing. I really enjoyed actually knowing about all of the characters that surrounded Okabe, it made them actually them feel real and only added to the immersion factor. Speaking of Okabe, his character development was kind of amazing. I don't want to ruin it, but he slowly changes throughout the anime and by the end I thought the was the same, but also completely different somehow. It was kind of amazing to see a character develop like that, usually character go from being wimpy to badass and losing all of if not most of their original traits, but not for Okabe. Other than the Okabe the other character develop in a similar fashion. Kurisu for example stays mostly the same during the whole anime, but she slowly becomes more ""open"" near the end, which is what I was hoping would happen, but wasn't expecting to. It's just nice to see things go the way I want them to every once in a while. 
    As for Mayuri I wouldn't have minded seeing her develop more like the other characters, but we did get to learn her back-story and learn how she came to act the way she does and to be honest sometimes characters don't need to ""develop"", sometimes they're fine the way they were and that's what I think about Mayuri. The other main character Itaru is in the same boat as Mayuri except i feel that he does mature a little bit by the end of the anime, even though it's not much it really does seem like he changed, if only a bit. 
Enjoyment-If you couldn't tell by now then i'll just go ahead and say it. STEINS;GATE WAS ONE OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE ANIMES I HAVE EVER WATCHED. There, it was really enjoyable, it was hilarious, it was sweet, it was horrific, it was intriguing, it was everything but boring. There isn't a dull moment in steins;gate, there is always something going on that is keeping you entertained, it's fun just watching the characters talk and interact with one another and it's even more enjoyable when they're faced with a challenge. It's simply enjoyable through and through and I can't think of anyone that wouldn't enjoy steins;gate. 
Overall- Overall this anime is a masterpiece. It does what it does perfectly and has no faults that I can think of, and I can usually pick apart any anime. It was high quality, enjoyable, written extremely well, atmospheric and just incredibly well done. I can safely reccomend this anime to anybody. Anyone can watch and enjoy steins;gate, but people that really enjoy science or romantic comedies will appreciate it that much more. We need more anime like this, more anime that isn't scared to tell their story and wrap itself up, more anime that don't waste your time, more anime that is high quality an original. Just go an watch it, you won't regret it.",10

                I started off watching Steins;Gate because I'd seen it had a very high score on Anime News Network, but I didn't know anything else about it (not even the premise) so I gave it a shot and threw the first episode into my pilot list. Maybe it could live up to the hype, and if not, I'd only have wasted about 20ish minutes. The first episode got me wondering, but the second caught me hook, line, and sinker.
Steins;Gate is largely a dialogue heavy story about time travel and the effect changing points in time will have on the reality you know to be true. I
                  could say it like ""diverging world lines"", but c'mon, I don't want to poorly explain M theory here. It'll change entire parts of peoples lives and memories, parts of the city, and even parts of history itself for an observer, that's all you need to know. The main protagonist, Okabe, is an eccentric ""scientist"" with a rag tag group of friends. Within the opening episode, he accidentally changes a point in time by pretty much using a phone that sends texts to the past, causing someone who should be dead in his reality to remain alive, the second main protagonist, Kurisu. As the show progresses, each ""lab member"" gets to change one piece of the past, slowly but surely changing everything Okabe knew to be real, leading to a terrible future where not all of his friends get to live. The time travel mechanics in this show open up a huge range of ways to keep the show from becoming stale and are probably the tightest I've ever seen outside a book, and the chemistry between the characters makes them feel more human than some people I've met. It's a deeply immersive show that you can really get pulled into, which is my excuse for watching the whole thing in one go and not my apparently terrible self control.
The writing in this show is superb from the each one of characters to how the plot progresses and deals with time travel changes, but what makes this show a ten in my book is the voice cast. This has without doubt the best english dub I've ever seen, there is no line of dialogue out of place. It made a place in Japan, where I'm pretty sure the culture is fairly different to mine, feel like a place I knew just down the road. Everyone feels genuine and believable, and it's hard not to want everything to work out for them. This is what got me to fall for the romance undertones of the two protagonsts, this show made me want them to be happy together. I really enjoyed how they didn't force a romance plot down your throat, it's done slowly and surprisingly tenderly throughout the show. You'll even like the platonic relationships before the halfway mark. The climactic scenes got my heart racing, my eyes watering, and my sleep schedule incredibly interrupted.  Watching a man's desperate struggle to change fate and save the people he cares about has never been done so well on any show, not just an anime. Just imagine it, if you could go back in time to save someone you cared for, how many times would you try until you got it right, and what would happen to you in the process?
The animation was very, very good. This is the kind of show that has a fairly limited amount of moving parts like fight scenes,  but I never took my eyes off the screen thanks to the subtle ways the show kept me engaged, from choices of colour, to set and character designs and unique poses, and background animation. The sound fits like a ribbon around the whole thing, never breaking the mood for a second and really toying with my emotions in those touchy feely scenes.
All in all, this show that I took a risk on with no knowledge about turned out to be my favourite modern (read post-2010) anime series I've ever seen, and I can't stop recommending it to my friends. I've already converted one, why not become number two and roll the dice like I did? There's a labcoat in it for you.",10

                Have you ever noticed how any movie or TV show about time travel has such a convoluted plot that that you can never quite remember what the heck actually happened? If you were to ask me to explain the plot of ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt know where to begin. Steins;Gate, however, manages to cut through all of the convoluted plots, scientific jargon and confusion in a presentation that is startlingly simple, yet very effective.
Steins;Gate seems to be that dark horse that no one expected to do well, yet finds itself ranked among the top shows on MAL. So is it really worth your
                  time?
Absolutely!
Breakdown:
 Story (10/10)- Steins;Gate is largely about the concept of time travel, yet much of the plot occurs without the presence of an actual time machine. So what does that leave us with? Well, the thing that attracted me to this show early on was how simple and charming it was. I could tell by the dramatic way this show opened that I wasn‚Äôt watching a comedy, yet I kept finding myself laughing at the way the characters interacted with one another.
The caste consists largely of the members of the ‚ÄúFuture Gadget Lab‚Äù, a group of nerdy, aspiring scientists (and a few others) who work in a small apartment. Their leader, a self proclaimed ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù has a vision for making all sorts of strange gadgets, but since his work is largely useless, they lack the funding to do anything substantial. By pure luck, they create a gadget that sends a text message into the past, and their small lab is never the same afterward.
Steins;Gate remains unique because the creators of the show didn‚Äôt abuse the concept of time travel. Frankly, they don‚Äôt even bother to throw a bunch of techno-babble at you. They simply show that the characters have created a device that sends text messages to the past, and allow the viewer‚Äôs imagination to fill in the gaps. This is much better than trying to come up with some ultimately made-up solution that doesn‚Äôt even make real sense.
Frankly, there‚Äôs no way to explain the plot of the show without giving everything away. However, as many shows with this theme do, Steins;Gate goes through quite a series of twists that you more than likely won‚Äôt see coming. Every time I thought I had this show figured out, it would surprise me again. No details are forgotten, and seemingly inconsequential things will frequently come back to become major obstacles for the characters to overcome.  By about halfway through the show, you‚Äôll begin to understand how truly intense the plot becomes.
The best thing about the story was that it kept me hooked, which is frankly the best, albeit subjective, measure of how well a story is designed.
Art (8/10) - A lot of this show seems to have a white, washed-out sort of look to it. It certainly helps to give the show the mood it‚Äôs going for, but does get a bit monotonous at times.  The characters‚Äô movements and costume designs are believable and satisfactory, but not outstanding. Frankly, there isn‚Äôt much more to say about this show‚Äôs art. There were barely any action scenes or explosions and no weird creatures to draw, so I suppose the creators left it simple. Well done.
Sound (9/10)- I noticed early on that there wasn‚Äôt much music in the show, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing, but Steins;Gate pushed the envelope in this area a bit. In lieu of music, there are often cicadas screeching in the background. This remains a theme throughout the show, and occasionally grew tedious to listen to. But during the shows more dramatic parts, music fades in on a much more regular basis, helping to add mood, but not much else. The only real musical bright spots were the opening and closing themes of the show, which I enjoyed tremendously.
However, it wasn‚Äôt the music that caused me to score it a 9/10, it was the voice acting. The voice actor for the protagonist was outstanding, and the rest of the cast filled in their roles admirably. The dialogue in this show easily could have come off as cheesy or overdone, but the skill of the actors involved really helped to keep everything believable. I especially enjoyed listening to that mad scientist cackle, which might have sounded ridiculous from another actor.
Characters (10/10)- Very few shows have made me laugh as hard as this one has, mostly due to the shenanigans of the protagonist, Okabe Rintarou. He calls himself ‚ÄúHououin Kyouma‚Äù, the mad scientist, but his friends all call him ‚ÄúOkarin‚Äù (presumably short for his full name). Okabe frequently pulls out his cell phone to talk to no one in particular, explaining how he‚Äôs being tailed by ‚Äúorganization‚Äù agents. His friends frequently point out that he isn‚Äôt talking to anyone, but this doesn‚Äôt seem to deter his paranoiac tenancies. He also gives ridiculous nicknames to many people he knows, such as ‚ÄúChristina‚Äù for Kurisu and ‚ÄúMr. Bruan‚Äù for his landlord. 
Okabe makes for a surprisingly believable ‚Äúmad-scientist‚Äù and his antics will certainly keep you entertained while the plot gets going. His friends Myauri (Tutulu!), Itaru and Kurisu make for a very interesting grouping. Mayuri is just downright adorable, Itaru a perverse computer hacker, and Kurisu a brilliant college student who won‚Äôt admit that she actually likes Okabe. Kurisu and Okabe see a lot of development as the show goes on, and they form a very believable friendship, where it seems as though neither of them truly understand how they feel about each other until late in the show. Okabe really just annoys her at first, but she later warms up to him as they continue to experiment on their gadgets. 
The character that receives the most development is Okabe, who is forced to witness true horrors over and over again as he tries to use time travel to sort things out. Watching him go from a quirky, paranoid goofball into a determined, yet depressed man is fascinating, if not sad to watch. Watching his character slowly change as he works to overcome the mess that he helped create is a very satisfying experience, and you‚Äôll find yourself loving him as he seems to mature in front of you.
The thing that impressed me most was how the show avoided ‚Äústock‚Äù characters. There wasn‚Äôt one specific ‚Äúcomic relief guy‚Äù or the ‚Äúaloof, secretive, detective guy‚Äù or even the ‚Äúhot, fanservice chick‚Äù. Instead, you had all of the characters working together to drive the plot, mood, and emotional impact of the show toward its conclusion. The charming cast is really what makes this show into the exceptional work that it is, even weird characters like Feyris, who feels the need to insert ‚Äúnyah‚Äù( the Japanese version of ‚Äúmeow‚Äù) in nearly every sentence she utters. 
The show did a remarkable job of making me actually care about nearly every character it introduced, which is certainly no easy feat.
Enjoyment (10/10)- Normally when I enjoy a show, I‚Äôll limit myself to one or two episodes a day, so that I can watch it for longer. I couldn‚Äôt help myself with Steins;Gate, and watched the final six episodes in one day, not to mention watching multiple episodes on several other occasions. The best way to explain it is that this show hooked me from early on and never let go, winding up on the list of my all-time favorites. Perhaps it‚Äôs because I went into it not knowing what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised.  This is one of only six shows I have ever given a 10/10, so you could say it impressed me quite a lot.
Give this one a shot. You won‚Äôt regret it.
Overall (10/10)- My overall scores don‚Äôt actually add up to ten, but there‚Äôs something about this show that I simply love. Somehow, this show was able to overcome its flaws in ways that made something truly exceptional. There were plenty of flaws in this show, and a number of ideas remained unexplored, but further explanation would have just bogged down the pace of the show, and would have ruined what I felt was a very satisfying conclusion.
Maybe some people don‚Äôt like happy endings, but I feel like some script writers try so hard to avoid a clich√© ending, that they ultimately make the show worse. I think Steins;Gate managed to avoid that trap in a way that didn‚Äôt make the ending feel cheap or artificial. I think a lot of shows could take a leaf out of the book of Steins;Gate, and who knows, maybe some will.
Here‚Äôs to hoping.

                Hello. I would like to say that all the people who overhype this anime disgrace actually good anime like Monster, Battlestar Galactica and others.
The story starts out very slowly and develops nowhere worth of notice, we are left with an open ending
The art is satisfactory, but nothing special. The main character looks kind of silly, but I guess that was done for a comedic purpose
The sound is generally very good, but that's it.
Characters are plain, unlikable, boring and clich√©. I think they are supposed to be funny and relatable, but that couldn't be further from the truth.
This was one of the least enjoyable animes I
                  have ever seen. I'm trying to think of another one that I didn't like that much and I can't come up with anything. I guess the reason why I dislike this anime so much is that I bothered to watch all the episodes and that I didn't just drop it at episode 5. In the end, MAL score fooled me.
Just writing this review and thinking about Steins;Gate gave me an actual headache! I am not even kidding! That's why it's so short.

                I like to think of this anime as two separate ones: the first half and the second half. I would like to review the two separately because I feel they are radically different in many levels. 
There‚Äôs a few super spoilers in this review, and that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs meant for people who‚Äôve already watched the show. If you don‚Äôt want spoilers, this review isn‚Äôt for you.
First half.
We, the viewers, get introduced to all the characters, and see exactly what they do and how they function. We also get a sense of what type of mood this anime is trying to set for us, which we
                  quickly realize is a sort of relaxed slice of life sort of thing. 
A few crazy things happen such as Kurisu‚Äôs dead body, and we learn that this anime will probably have plenty of serious moments. The viewer learns about John Titor and the conspiracy with SERN, and we get to learn with the characters how time travel works in their world. 
I must say that I thought the first half of the anime was extremely compelling and a great watch. My favorite scenes are when Okabe is chatting with John Titor online, and when the crew reads the info about sending people into the past and them turning into green gooey messes. I found it very interesting when they finally built their time machine and began sending text messages to the past in order to see the effects. While sometimes it didn‚Äôt make any sense (Ruka for example), it was nevertheless interesting and fun to watch the characters squirm over it.
Second half (begins when Mayuri gets shot by the FB girl)
This is when the show radically changes its mood.  No longer are we just watching some scientists discuss time travel oh no, now an important character has been killed and Okabe is on a quest to save her. This second half is really just awful, and completely transforms the anime into something it was doing so well not being; a standard time travel show.
Now, the mood change alone isn‚Äôt what makes this second half so bad. In fact, the shift could have been awesome if not for one thing: the plot. The plot at times just doesn‚Äôt make any sense logically. Let me run through the ones that most bother me.
1. Mayuri dying. 
Was there any real reason why Mayuri was destined to die regardless of what Okabe did to try to save her? Not that I can recall. As long as Okabe pulled her away from the first way she died, which was getting shot by the FB girl, Mayuri should have been fine. But no, for some reason, in order to save her, Okabe has to reverse all the texts he sent in the past and only then will Mayuri be able to live. 
Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt see the logic in that? What exactly would reversing the texts accomplish? Maybe reversing FB‚Äôs text would stop her from killing, but what relates the remaining texts to Mayuri at all? 
2. Breaking the anime‚Äôs own rules. 
The anime made it very clear that they were only capable of sending a few bites through time and anything larger would become a green gooey mess because it would have to be compressed and whatnot. However, it discards that completely by revealing that John Titor indeed came from the future with her very own time machine. The anime pulls a double whammy of breaking it‚Äôs own rules by first having John state that she cannot go forward in time, only backward. However, later on John comes back with a time machine that can now travel both ways. Come on, give me some consistency.
3. Many girls Okabe talks to suddenly gets flashes of parallel worlds.
Was there any reason that the Nyan nyan girl, Ruka, or Kurisu would get flashes of what happened in alternate time lines? Okabe is the only one who can recall the alternate time lines, and why that is is explained in the anime. No logic is given as to why these girls suddenly remember what they did in a world that didn‚Äôt happen for them. Nyan nyan should never have recalled that her father died in the other time line. Why would she? 
In addition to these flaws in the logic, I also just had trouble keeping up with Okabe. I just didn‚Äôt think Mayuri was worth saving. Maybe if she was a more interesting girl who I, as a viewer, also got attached to, then I would have cared. Unfortunately, she isn‚Äôt really developed much at all, and as such I couldn‚Äôt have cared less whether Mayuri died or not. Maybe if Kurisu was the one getting killed each time that might have helped. 
Those are my main complaints about the latter half. It also gets painfully obvious the anime is based off of an H-game in this half, as Okabe later gets some alone time with each girl. Those scenes are neither fitting for the mood, nor entertaining. It was especially bad since the anime long abandoned it‚Äôs slice of life cheery mood in exchange for the rush mode in the latter half. These dating scenes were horribly out of place, unless, of course, I was playing an H-game. 
If I got to rewrite the latter half, I might take out the Mayuri getting killed shenanigans completely. The anime didn‚Äôt have to turn into a rescue mission, it could have just continued with its first half‚Äôs style of time travel research, and continue teaching it‚Äôs moral lessons about how changing the past has drastic consequences that nobody could anticipate. They could have sent some message into the past which causes a certain character to never be born, or to never meet Okabe, and the characters could be developed as Okabe tries to fix the messes he‚Äôs responsible for. Okabe could send a message into the past which triggers himself never being born, ooh that would be really interesting. They could have, while researching, received a text from themselves in the future. What kind of message would it be, and would they ignore it? John Titor‚Äôs method of time travel could have been something crazier, like a worm hole appearing in the future. Time travel is a great concept, and could have been done in a much more compelling way in the latter half. The first half is great though, so I recommend watching that.",7
"
                I'm gonna start this review out right. HOLY SWEET JESUS. THE PLOT.
Now that we have that out of the way let's continue with this ramble of a review. Steins;Gate was an anime that  I was rather skeptical on. Don't know why but I saw no appeal into it. Even the first few episodes of watching I thought this was going to be a rather mediocre and cliche story.
...As I speak i'm kicking my own ass for this. Steins;Gate is what many consider a marvel. A simple masterpiece of the explanation of time travel. While this is in it's own respect an excellent anime, to
                  call it the best anime would be overshooting it. While everyone on the face of the earth is trying to find all the good things about this putative 24 Episode epic, i'm going to try my hardest to bash this anime. Believe me, this is going to be a very hard job to do.
First things first, this is not a Sci-Fi show you don't simple wait a day for an episode to watch. A lot of anime have a rather annoying knack to drag you in with a completely unrealistic plot that just brainwashes you into watching 6 or 7 episodes a night,  losing sleep. As I say that, I just burned through 12 episodes in one day.
Anyways, to what actually matters. Steins;Gate has a somewhat predictable plot. Provided that the beginning of the story seems very mysterious and kinda blurry. Once you finally synced into the plot of what Okabe's motives and inventions are, it becomes a rather predictable and somewhat based story line. Of course, this adaptation came from a game so that doesn't help.
It ain't no color masterpiece. There really hasn't been too many scenes in the anime where the main characters will go out the window and see the world filled with beauty, grace, disgust, or griminess. It's rather disappointing because they can make some photogenic clouds man. :c
The Characters are your standard bread and butter characters that you get to see in tragic times. Meh. What can I really say except, ditto? The Tsundere acts like Tsundere, the Yandere acts like Yandere, the mad scientist acts like a made scientist. What else do you want?
The story is somewhat of a common idea; not exactly being overdone by other various popular topics like the over exaggeration on adorable people and items. Time Travel is a mythology that has been implemented into many video games, shows, and movies before Steins;Gate's time like Star Trek, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, The Legend of Zelda. The difference here, this is a different type of Time Traveling. Maybe I am being too biased onto how varied Steins;Gate's theories are. Take a guess.
So overall...It is an outstanding anime. It isn't named ranked #3 of the best anime in MAL for satirical reasons. The plot has some of the best views and images of how time travel can come to be. All the characters play their parts correctly and add their own flare to them. To me, this anime took the best of meme jokes and cheap gags and combined it with a mixed plot, science, and a really bizarre and crazy scientist. It flows evenly and nice throughout the whole show and I would be lying to you if I said that the plot isn't amazing. Check this one out as soon as you can. I can guarantee  you, it will not disappoint.",10
"
                Steins;Gate: The best time travel anime series that ever was or will be. Or exceedingly close to it anyway. And yes, this type of statement needs to be justified so let's rewind a bit and we'll see why it deserves your full attention. This is a clever anime that's initially deceiving, and then surprises you for all the right reasons. Dropping this show before reaching at least the halfway point is an error of gigantic proportions, and it means that some viewers may unfortunately miss out on this gem of a series.
Apart from the opening episode the anime has an arguably slow start, where the
                  central characters perform many scientific experiments in their lab to research time travel. That is until we reach the conclusion of one particular test, and then BAM! Just a few minutes later you realise everything up until now has been part of a smartly concealed ploy. You've become emotionally invested in the characters. When bad things start to happen, you suddenly find yourself caring about them. As major events unfold you'll find it hard to tear your eyes away for even a moment. The first few episodes have served to develop the core group of characters as well as to provide details about the experiments, of which the ensuing drama is based upon. Which in turn allows the pacing of the story to speed up when it needs to, and from this point onwards it's an amazing experience. 
The transition from the jaw-dropping cliff-hanger ending of one episode to the start of the next, is where Steins;Gate changes from a merely decent anime with an interesting concept and striking visuals into the beginnings of a near-masterpiece in storytelling and suspense. The conclusion to this series is not too shabby either. In fact, it's brilliantly executed and answers many of the questions asked throughout the story. 
The lab members are a colourful group who have good chemistry with each other, and there's hardly a single annoying trait between them. You'll quickly become accustomed to each person's individual mannerisms. Okabe Rintarou's conversations with himself, his mad scientist personality, and his amusing interactions with others, are merely a few examples of the things which make him such a tremendous lead character to follow within the story. Makise Kurisu's not exactly far behind; she's intelligent, she's cute, she has several great verbal exchanges with Okabe, and she's a perfect tsundere. Hashida Itaru's perverted imaginations provide some good comic relief, but he's also a capable computer hacker who's a big help to Okabe. Shiina Mayuri's a cheerful, openly honest and good-natured girl who is friendly with everyone, so how anyone can dislike her is beyond my comprehension. She's also Okabe's childhood friend but not a love interest (this is not a romantic comedy). Others such as Amane Suzuha, Kiryuu Moeka and Urushibara Ruka are also recurring characters in the anime but to go into too much detail about them might spoil the story. The total number of characters in Steins;Gate may not be huge, but that's due to the absence of any pointless people; nearly everyone has a significant role in the storyline to at least some degree. 
Throughout his adventures, Okabe will inevitably realize that messing around with time travel also affects the lives of the people around him, and so any consequences that arise must be delicately handled. It's in this way that much of the character development occurs for Okabe and we learn more about his friends. 
Talented voice actors/actresses, strong opening and closing theme songs, solid yet subtle instrumental music, nice background art, and smooth character animation all contribute to this anime's fantastic production values. 
It's common for even the best of anime to contain a few minor flaws, and Steins;Gate is no different in this regard. This includes a distinct lack of action at the start of the anime, and several unconvincingly glossed-over details in the story overall. It's difficult for any form of media such as films or anime to discuss the technicalities of time travel, because in reality we don't know whether  it truly exists. Are there contradictions and unexplained theories in Steins;Gate? Perhaps. The important thing, however, is that the anime feeds us with so much exposition (along with a fantastic cast and a compelling story), that we won't care about the small details until long after the final episode ends, if at all.
It's also highly advisable to watch the excellent Steins;Gate OVA afterwards, which is basically episode 25, as it provides extra closure and an epilogue of sorts for the characters. Moreover, tidbits found within the series tease us about events that occur in the future, so hopefully the upcoming Steins;Gate movie will explore this in greater scope.
Steins;Gate is an anime that warrants at least a second viewing. Who knows? You might discover things that you missed out on or didn't fully understand at first. Nonetheless, it offers superb entertainment and thrilling drama that's unlikely to lose out to any other series. Highly recommended stuff for any fan of anime.",9

                Well, it's time to write a huge and no one interesting feedback on this title If anything, then there are no spoilers. He definitely went into my top 10 anime and definitely went into my soul, but let's start in order.
Story 9/10- It is interesting, it captures and is a bit complicated at the beginning, only after watching a few episodes begin to understand what's what. At the same time everything begins with fun and adventure, and then you watch 12 episode.... for the whole title I had time to experience many emotions and tenderness, and joy, and happiness, and shock, and pain, but despite
                  the last interest only increased. Of course, without story holes did not happen for example at the end you can find several her which seem to, be significant, but also not and yet we do not know much about the future worlds.
Art 8/10- In general, the drawing is good, given that the title is already 7 years old.
Sound 8/10- music is always on topic, the voices of the characters are very cool.
Characters 10/10- all the characters in action are revealed very well, the main characters, such as Mayuri, Main hero or Kurisu for example, very much empathize, to them you penetrate and you understand them. For their development is interesting watch. So you can see how throughout the title Okabe, Rintarou changes and by the middle it is not the same person, as it was in the beginning, well, and Kurisa top tsundere, they all have their own problems, and they all have to make tough decisions, in one word they are felt as alive, and not as a puppet doll. It is a pity that all this time was not enough time for Moeka, Ruka, and Rumiho, but even to them you have time to penetrate.
Enyoyment 10/10- Anime did not let go until the end.
Overall 10/10- Although someone complains that the beginning is stretched, but on the contrary it was fun to watch this atmosphere in that small laboratory- Masterpiece
Review wrote on emotions.",10

                I know this anime is highly acclaimed by virtually everyone, I understand it is a favorite of many respectable anime lovers, and I don't want to offend anyone. I am posting this review simply for the fun of expressing my (divergent) opinion. Please read on before judging and feel free to discuss! 
***
Steins;Gate is definitely worth watching for its peculiar take on time travel and its unique main character, but it otherwise doesn‚Äôt stand out as an exceptional anime. It never completely sheds its visual novel skin, and therefore the storytelling and characterization feel stiff and restricted.
Story 8
The basis for the story is excellent: a
                  very intriguing concept of time machine is introduced early on, and the possibility of switching between world lines is a gold mine of narrative opportunities. What makes these ideas even more remarkable is the fact that the whole thing feels well-researched and consistent, respecting its own set of rules without major contradictions. However, I don‚Äôt think the show took full advantage of its powerful plot drive. The first half of the series is mostly dedicated to pedestrian slice-of-life that feels shallow and repetitive. The pace picks up halfway through, but even then, the plot remains disappointingly linear for a story about time travel and there are few actual surprises. If anything, some plot points seem rather random. There is no definite statement about time travel, no obvious consequences, which feels lackluster as it is in essence a sensitive ethical question. Had the series ended at episode 22, we could have concluded that messing with time is futile in the face of fatality, but the last two episodes changed the game and made another kind of time travel acceptable. Overall, it felt like time travel was used as an excuse to create personal drama rather than as a way to drive the story forward. Incidentally, drama is precisely where the anime is most successful in my opinion: it depicts the emotional journey of the main character with commendable sensibility. So, although it isn‚Äôt as poignant as Toki wo Kakeru Shojo, I think Steins;Gate fares better as drama than science fiction.
Characters 7
The main protagonist deserves praise for being so unique and off-the-wall. He surrounds himself with friends by assuming a mad scientist persona, and although he can be quite extravagant and bossy, he is actually a very caring person. He has enough charisma and quirks to be credible as the mobilising force of the group. On the other hand, the said friends are bland cardboard cut-outs from every anime you‚Äôve ever seen - tsundere, moe, maid caf√©, otaku - and they remain perfectly one dimensional throughout the series. Not only are these characters defined by their stereotype, they barely interact with each other beyond the usual ‚Äúyou‚Äôre cute‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a pervert‚Äù. The interactions between the protagonist and the side characters nonetheless manage to be interesting, and it leads to heartfelt moments towards the second half of the anime. Once again, the real highlight is the character development on the protagonist‚Äôs part. The way his tribulations shape his motivations and behaviour is both captivating and endearing.
Sound 9
The opening is very catchy and will probably stick with me for a long time. The voice acting is great. Sure, it made me question the clich√©s at stance (do fat guys really have to have that voice? do you know any girl who actually talks like that?), but considering what they were given, I think the voice actors did a fantastic job. They kept it real and enjoyable, without going over the top. Similarly, I enjoyed the rest of the soundtrack, which was mostly subtle and understated.
Art 7
I liked the character design and the art style in general, but I thought the animation was average. Faces got distorted under certain angles and perspective wasn‚Äôt always done right, which ended up being a distraction. On top of that, backgrounds were mostly dull and repetitive.
Enjoyment 5
It‚Äôs hard to understand why I didn‚Äôt enjoy this anime when everybody else did. Perhaps I had too much expectations going into the series, but to me it felt like a dry visual novel adaptation. Between the pacing problems, the annoying characters and the pointless conversations, I had to drag myself forcefully through the first half of the series. The episodes were so uneventful I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell whether I was at episode 3 or 7. During the second half, it became truly enjoyable and even thrilling, but it was not enough to make me forget about the boring start. I found the story to be well crafted on a technical point of view, but lacking purpose or surprise. It ends up being a good anime, but nothing more, and I am left wondering what is supposed to be so great about it.
In summary, I think the real strength of Steins;Gate is its genuine depiction of emotions, whereas it falls short in terms of having a convoluted plot or a philosophical perspective. The anime also irremediably suffers from its unoriginal cast of characters, except for the exceptional protagonist.

I apologize again for trashing the # 2 anime on this website, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying all these bad things about an anime that scores so high.

                Steins;Gate. Where do I begin this (very) belated review?
Steins;Gate was undoubtedly the best anime I have ever seen. It is a heart-wrenching suspenseful anime, with comedy, mystery, and romance. The story is a very unique one, basically dealing with time travel and the butterfly effect. From the moment I met Okabe Rintarou, the protagonist of this utterly phenomenal anime, I knew that I would not be able to leave my computer for a while. The art is fairly well done, as is the sound. The character development was absolutely amazing and captivated me for the entire duration of the anime. Finally, I completely enjoyed this
                  anime to the fullest. The overall score for Steins;Gate is a 10.
Story: 10/10
There aren't many stories, let alone anime, that deal with time travel. Steins;Gate tackled that daunting topic and even managed to develop an interesting story line. Don't get me wrong: there were flaws here and there. However, eventually the good outweighed the few negatives. The episodes were all completely essential and included for a reason. Everything that happened was of significance. The first few episodes were a bit confusing to me, personally, but I stuck with it and I do not regret a single moment.
Art: 9/10
I'm not really in a position to criticize art (I'm a terrible artist), but if I really had to think about it, a 9 is the score I would give it. The characters were well-drawn, and really none of them looked crazy or un-human as in most other animes. Each one of them looked like they could have been a real person that existed. The art for nonliving objects was also very well-drawn. For example, the numerous machinery that is encountered contains a lot of detail. However, nothing really stood out to me as being absolutely stunning, resulting in this score of 9.
Sound: 9/10
The music in this anime was very fitting for each scene. If the moment was a heart-wrenching one, the right music would be playing. If the moment was a comedic one, the right music would be playing. Sound effects such as chirping cicadas or crashing sounds were all on point. Even so, there were several flaws, such as too much chirping or not enough music. In the end, however, the sound was very-well produced.
Character: 10/10
If I could have given the characters a score higher than 10, I definitely would have. The character development is what truly makes this anime such a masterpiece. Each character is important. There are absolutely no irrelevant characters. Each one is also unique, with their own quirks, flaws, and habits. Throughout the anime, each of them grows significantly, contributing to the development of such a great anime. They are all so different, yet all together as friends, mingling and letting their personalities clash in a way that makes them fit together. I could not imagine this anime with the loss of a single character. The character work was absolutely superb.
Enjoyment: 10/10
The plot of Steins;Gate and the storyline are incredibly well-written. My heart was extremely confused throughout this anime. At some points, it would be pumping with laughter, and others, weak and heavy with misery. I never knew what would happen next, and each moment was a new twist for me. The thought that was put into this anime is very admirable and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Steins;Gate is an absolutely amazing anime. If you do watch it, be prepared for a wild, emotional roller coaster. When you get off, though, you will regret nothing.",10
"
                Story: 3/10. The first half of the show was a drag to get through, although it layed out the rules of the D-mail and time travel alright; too bad this was diluted with random journeys to the maid cafe with the most boring character Feyris, as well as episodes where literally nothing happens. Seriously, most of the initial episodes could've been used to establish deeper relationships between characters, but we just get these characters doing their generic character stereotype: Daru tells perverted jokes, Mayushii tuturus and Kurisu acts like a tsundere.
When the show actually picks up at episode 12, it really is just a few
                  episodes of Okabe being dumb and not talking to anyone else about his predicament just to kill some episode time, and then he finally realizes what he has to do to fix everything. We get a pretty interesting arc about Suzuha, but of course that only lasts for like an episode before we get two harem episodes of Okabe with Feyris and then Ruka. The show ends up picking up again towards the end, but it breaks the rules of time travel it established to give a cheesy ending leaving alot of plotholes. 
Art: 8/10. The show has decent art and animation, no complaints here.
Sound: 8/10. The music in this show is probably the only thing that stands out to me.
Character: 2/10. The characters are undoubtedly the worst aspect of this show. The majority just serve as a plot-device for Okabe to overcome some sort of trial, and the extent of their character is some generic, run-of-the-mill anime stereotype. Kurisu's only purpose is to help Okabe with time travel, and when she's not servicing this purpose she's a generic tsundere with a bland personality; Daru's only purpose is to hack stuff, and when he's not doing that he just tells perverted jokes. And Mayushii, wow, I'm not sure why she's so popular. All she does is TUTURU, not to mention her only purpose is to exist so Okabe can try and save her. I can go on and on about my most hated characters Feyris and Ruka, but they're so forgettable it wouldn't matter. 
The only saving grace is Okabe, he has an actual personality and, at the expense of every other character just being a device for Okabe to grow, he matures from start to end. So, +1 for him. 
Enjoyment: 2/10. I didn't enjoy much in this show except for the later episodes dealing with Suzuha. Everything from the characters to their relationships to their personalities all felt bland and one-dimensional. The actual logic behind time-travel was interesting in the beginning, but amid the awkward pacing the show was a drag to get through; and when the show reached a turning point, it decided to throw out its set-up to depend on the concept of fate for an intriguing story. I'm not sure what it was trying to go for here. To make matters worse, it turns out everyone can remember world lines to a degree, so all that deep talk about time traveling erasing the past you hold dear and making you grow distant from your loved ones is just tossed out the window; it's totally fine, Okabe and Kurisu can just have their perfect ending now. 
Overall: 2/10. The show takes too long to pick up and maintains an awkward pace throughout. It has a a few high points among many low points, but its high points aren't much higher than its low. I'm not sure what's so special about this show, maybe I need to re-watch to 'get it', but the logic of time travel made sense and there wasn't any point where I felt lost; I just felt the actual good parts of the show were diluted by bland characters and terrible pacing. We'd have dragged-on comedy dilute the effect of a dramatic event many times for instance, and a lot of episodes are just Okabe contemplating the same thing many times before he decides to actually act on them. For a guy who says he depends on his lab mates, he really likes doing everything himself and messing up the situation even more.",2

                No Spoilers
Intriguing? Breathtaking? Enrapturing? Heartwarming? Too few words in the English language to do this anime justice. All the praise one can possibly attribute to this anime is probably not sufficient to do it justice. The genre is an unique one, a blend of sci-fi, romance and mystery. Stein's Gate is probably the best in each category.
The concept of Time explained in detail and stretched to its limits using all known scientific knowledge. The dangers of time travel, the logical inconsistencies, the causality effects, all beautifully highlighted in this show. However all such concepts have been portrayed in the simplest way possible and no scientific
                  knowledge of such things are a prerequisite to appreciate the essence of this show. Delving into metaphysics and skirting the edge of our understanding of time, this anime is more than worthwhile for any person sufficiently interested in the mysteries of the world.
Romance done right? Most definitely. What's brilliant is that the devs intertwined romance and Time into one entity and used it as a landing board for the development of the plot. Romance is central to the understanding of this story and romantics can cherish this story line without undue deliberation. The story is quite tragic at times and the impact Time has on people's lives have been highlighted in excruciating detail, especially when Time Travel is a possibility. Without romance, this series wouldn't have been what it is today.
Character development is one of the many strong aspects of this anime. The number of characters are quite few in relation to other anime and each character has thus been developed in detail, leaving no room for criticism. Attachments to the characters only grows as the series progresses and delves into the hidden realm of Time Travel.
Soundtrack is nice, appropriate for the setting and generally pleasant. The animation is excellent, with richly detailed characters. The animation is focused towards the characters and not much dedicated to the surrounding environment, in due part that this anime is all about the characters involved, and their relationships with each other.
Overall, one of the best of all time. A must watch for anime lovers. A fantastic, intriguing ride that delivers satisfaction and contentment of the highest degree.",10

                Steins;Gate‚Ä¶  I have never wanted to don a lab coat and drink Dr.Pepper more in my entire life. 
Story: Simply stunning and Steins;Gate‚Äôs best allure. This story made me wonder if time travel could be possible and gave me geeky conversations about the theories and physics the anime employs.  Isn‚Äôt this what a good story is supposed to do? 
Some have said that it‚Äôs predictable, and it can be at times. The middle of the anime is pretty predictable, mostly because other sci-fi time travel stories have used the same plot elements. However the end was something fresh and surprising that distances itself
                  from the rest of the herd. The anime also does an excellent job of balancing comedy and drama. The last half of the anime gets progressively darker with plenty of tear-jerking moments. A few times I was on the edge of my seat, hoping that things would work out for the characters. As a fan of science fiction, I enjoyed seeing all the pop culture and scientific references (though this could hinder the experience of those not familiar with them). Back to the Future, Dr. Who, Heidegger, Black Holes, SQL programming, CERN (which, amusingly is the antagonist in the plot), and the real legend of John Titor all contribute to the show. For those unfamiliar with John Titor or any of the above actually, please Google it! It will make the show‚Äôs experience even more enjoyable! 
Art: Phenomenal. Huke‚Äôs (who also did Black Rock Shooter) original art used in the visual novels is animated perfectly and really makes the characters stand out from other series‚Äô. Since this is Huke, expect a large amount of focus on the eyes. The large vibrant irises of the characters give them a rather ‚Äúdeep‚Äù feeling, I guess. Some frames include what I believe to be ‚Äúmetaphorical‚Äù art, such as the consistent images of cicadas and dragonflies. Character designs are also unique and lend to their personalities or ‚Äústereotypes‚Äù which I‚Äôll cover soon.
Sound: The piano score in this is fantastic! Some tunes conjure up an ominous feel as startling revelations unravel and others evoke sadness or joy. Accompanied with the scenes, the music lends weight to the plot. Okabe even has his own ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù score that plays as he figures out how to outwit his obstacles. I also love the sound of cicadas that give the anime an atmosphere of summer heat. The opening song ‚ÄúHacking to the Gate‚Äù is okay, but it‚Äôs the main ending song by Yui Sakakibara that I fell in love with. The whole shattered glass motif that comes together to form an hourglass goes great with the music and lyrics. 
Characters: All lovable, though my one gripe with the show is the lack of development for some characters that only seem to show up when it‚Äôs convenient or to further the plot. One common complaint others have is that the characters are ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù or are too one-dimensional. I understand this complaint though I loved their personalities and found them to be consistent and accurate. I mean I can always rely on the perverted quips from Daru to break up the tension and make me laugh. Okabe‚Äôs your paranoid schizophrenic mad scientist that feels like Dr.Horrible meets Inspector Gadget, Daru‚Äôs the perverted overweight Super Haxor (Hacker!), and Kurisu‚Äôs the tsundere genius girl. Wait‚Ä¶ these aren‚Äôt very stereotypical (except for the genius tsundere which I‚Äôve seen a few times now). The shrine maiden, Rukako, even has a pleasant surprise that might make some uncomfortable. Watching this maybe the third time through, I really fell in love with Mayuri. She‚Äôs pure moe and adorable, but also probably the most perceptive character in the series. Though no mad scientist or genius she figures things out quickly (like emotions of other characters and even an important plot point later on). I just wish I seen more of Moeka, Braun, Rukako, or even Nae!
Overall Steins;Gate was a rollercoaster of emotions, I was laughing one episode than on the verge of tears the next. The creators really did their research into the information they used as well, and the science was spot-on! (Especially where Daru cracks the SQL tables to get into a rather sinister Organization's files). This is an easy 10/10 for me and I‚Äôd recommend it to any anime or science fiction fan. I now own the Blu-Ray box set and an artbook. I even got my friend who doesn‚Äôt watch anime into this show‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs how great it is.",10

                Spoiler Free: To be fair I am going to say everything I felt was good and what was bad.
What I liked about this Anime?
Jellyman concept and how time travel human experiments showed up in the past.  The use of Einsteins theories and an almost real organization. 
What I disliked?
The characters are extremely shallow and obvious.   The villain are immediately detectable and all characters are face value and lack any true depth. This anime felt like a grind then it being rated so highly I wanted to enjoy it and I was just wondering when it would shine.  Instead the obvious happens
                  over and over again leaving you to painstakingly watch as the main character makes poor decision after poor decision.
How could it have been improved?
Actual used the concepts it set out to show.  It disguised itself as an intelligent scientific anime and at episode 4-5 when it starts to show some of that it pitches it all into the bin and goes drab.  
Overall.
This anime is not for people of any caliber.  It wants to make the viewer feel smart as though they are watching something deep and that is never the case.  Ultimately it pretends to have intellectual concepts when its just very basic psychology lumped in with poor human decisions and obvious characters.",1
"
                A significant issue I find with reviews in general is their inability to reflect criticism to any noteworthy degree. Reviews are, by their nature, consumer requirements in an age of instant gratification. I will attempt to cheat a little here and mention, straight away, that my opinion of Steins;Gate was and is not entirely influenced by its existence as an anime. I am not familiar with judging the art and music in a commercial, ""it's worth your time"", quasi-objective sense. So, if I am forced to give a score, please note my unfamiliarity with what is expected of the system of review that is in
                  place. Also, I apologise for not preventing tl;dr and spoiling the story.
Right. Steins;Gate. ""Best anime ever. Best romance. Best time travel story."" Praises written almost every day. Why not? The most visible anime shows are not based on realistic settings. The romance, located at the core of its melodramatic appeal, elevates the stakes in a story whose protagonist is a  character I felt the strongest of empathy and jealousy towards because of his ability to handle psychological trauma. The rules of time-travelling, as obtuse as they may seem when delivered only through subtitles make the sort of weird sense anyone who understands, at least conceptually, multiple-worlds theory and the butterfly effect will recall being fairly comprehensive, if completely absurd on more than one occassion. And yet. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a ""yet"". To one of the best loved anime in the English-speaking world.
Should there be a ""yet""? Well, if anything didn't, they'd be perfect and one can't love anything perfect. Steins;Gate, thus, cannot be perfect. That is why there should be a ""yet"". So, what after ""yet""?
Depending on where you stand, the story works best as an anime or as a visual novel. I was of the former opinion until my third time through, when I realised what the format does to the story: compress. The first act of Steins;Gate, stretching from episode one to episode twelve, had to cover the most bizarre portion of the story. This includes the humour (mostly Japan-exclusive internet and culture jargon but also partly the relationship between English and its usage in Japan), the interpersonal relationships (three of which are fueled by daddy issues only a man, like Rintaro, can fix), roles (the tsundere, the chyunni, the innocent childhood friend &c.), and, finally, the subject of time travel. That's not to say that compression did not help. It just doesn't when you space out your viewings, something that I did not do for the first and the second times I watched the show. And when I did that was when I found what had hooked me on to the show. The thirteenth episode. The beginning of the second act.
If you watch the thirteenth episode and do not instantly decide to watch the fourteenth, you will not be sucked into the show. Chances are you probably never were interested. The thirteenth episode is the episode when Steins;Gate comes alive, because Steins;Gate reveals itself as having been written with a traditional three-act structure. Steins;Gate owes its success to this structure, because the stakes and how they are resolved become clear. Rintaro sees Mayuri die. He can't accept it. He can change the past and so, keeps doing so until he gets his way. No matter the cost.
You see, that is the most powerful emotion displayed by Rintaro and, by extension, the show: his selfishness towards those closest to him. The visual novel gives you an option to allow for him to move on after she dies. The anime doesn't. He's as trapped as you are in the choices of Steins Gate, because this Steins Gate can make a choice that is not necessarily yours and that choice is Rintaro has to save Mayuri. (It is possible to interpret Houoin Kyouma, separate from Okabe Rintaro, knows that he is in a piece of media, because the choice of Steins Gate is whatever the ""animators"", you, in the visual novel, or Madhouse, in the show, choose.) It is Okabe Rintaro who denies us observing him at his own peril.
The third act, which begins with the seventeenth episode (the one that came after the depressing letter by Suzuha), looks to resolve the issues brought up so far, including the romantic tension that powers the interactions between Rintaro and Kurisu, who is much less unbearable (please allow me to explain below before you go looking for a turd to throw my way). This is where the visual novel and the anime diverge again. The anime benefits from focus here, the visual novel from depth. So, Rintarou does not stop to consider his actions because, if he does, he loses sight of his objective and he will never do that. No matter the cost.
And so we have the third act ending with Kurisu preventing Okabe from destroying himself entirely in an effort to keep her and Mayuri safe. She accepts his love for her and, in a moment of brilliant writing and performance, Kyouma initiates the climax with theatricality while Rintaro is forced to witness it as a tragedy. Kyouma laughs, wanting to cry. Mayuri tells him that it is alright. The 22nd episode is the best and the most unfortunate episode in the series. 
The credits roll. We contemplate the harrowing journey of Rintaro, a boy who became a man after recognising his capacity for stoicism and self-sacrifice. The hourglass comes together and... it shatters. The fourth act of the three-act Steins;Gate begins.
This ""clean"" ending, taken from the visual novel's ""true"" ending, is the lack of foresight that exposes how the writers of the show never really cared much for Rintaro. If they did, they'd give him the happy ending in the same episode after the reveal or, better, not write the 22nd episode with the third act's climax. If they wanted to reiterate the theme of fatalism, then the credits would finish without the reveal and it would have been a tragic and great. The writers and the directors did not care about what the happy ending meant for Rintaro, instead making two episodes explaining how Rintaro ""won"" with the help of his future self. Okabe's victory was Steins Gate's choice, the Steins Gate whose choices were made by its burden as an adaptation. The visual novel, without the pretense of structure and an ending where Kurisu dies despite Rintaro's love for her, represents a possibility for stronger thematic depth.
Apart from the structure that it axes, the show's problems are also visible in its portrayal of women. I realise that the show is an attempt to subvert the ""harem"" genre by leaning towards realism (*sigh*). Sure. Three (including the bishonen) of the six women fall in love with Rintaro explicitly over the course of his adventure. One may have been in love with him for a long time. That's a 66% success rate for a guy who acts like he is a mad scientist stuck in his teens. Wow. I didn't know women were into lab coats. The show talks about the ""naughty"" and the ""perverted"", but makes sure that it never becomes the text of the show, fearing that the characters wouls lose their ""innocence"". I suppose it makes the show easier to compare itself with Romeo and Juliet. Also, did I mention that three of them have daddy issues? One wants to find her dad, one doesn't want to lose hers and one wants to seek hers out and get his approval. The magnitude of batty characterisation increases in that order. 
The third problem is Kurisu. ""Oh really?"" Yes. You see, Kurisu exists with the rest of the cast, not apart from them. Mayuri mellows her angst, Itaru creeps her out, Okabe makes her less incompetent (as she works among big shots at some university THE rated #1 or #2, or some government research lab), you get the idea. The problem is that her personality is genuinely damaged. She has to be slapped by Suzuha into realising that she cares. She hates having to reveal anything about herself to other people, even if they get to know her from the future where she is okay with it. She ends up building a time-machine from a combination of self-hatred and narcissism. Who, in their right minds, thinks this is healthy behaviour? This is exacerbated in the visual novel, where she is so much more cutting while rebuking Rintaro as there is no run-time to worry about. Of course she has issues, but the show ends by preventing her from ever meaningfully resolving it. She exists for the gut-punch of a climax, and her continued existence leaves the show with a terrible coupling between two socially-awkward and sexually-distant teenagers who would, in real life, end up with one of them murdering the other over emotional/ intellectual harassment within a few years, if they don't break up. 
Finally, the fourth act that they took another two episodes with gives an ending that they tried their best to write around for the OVA and the movie. No wonder Steins;Gate 0 doesn't have Kurisu still alive at the beginning of it. She is just too smart for her own and Steins Gate's good. Even Rintaro cannot help that.
But. Yes, ""yet's"" hated sister, ""but"". Steins;Gate is loved. There is not another way to put it. The voice actors are always impressive: they convey the tone of the scene in ways that still gives me goosebumps. Seriously, Miyano could be heard almost crying when Kyouma is declaring his (premature) victory after Imai gives that painful (at the time) farewell which makes you want to yell ""no, this is too much"" at the screen.  The cinematography is strange, with long lingering shots and random jump cuts that come from nowhere and last less than a second. But the characters' eyes appear closest to human eyes. Considering this is a Japanese anime. Music, especially in melodramatic scenes, is excellently used. 
So, Steins;Gate. A show I, *sigh*, love. A show I know cannot (and, perhaps, should not) be perfect. A show that I have a lot to thank for revealing to me what i prize about masculinity and a show to which I dedicate my first review.",8
"
                So, this can be a nostalgic anime for some and I get that, what I won't accept tho is clouding of judgment when it comes to rating the overall experience. 
This anime has some of the most annoyingly written characters in any piece of media I have consumed during my 22 years of living. The story does not suffice for that, either. The experience as a whole gives off an animated Wattpad story vibe, written by some nerdy kid who had put himself in the shoes of the MC. 
It could've been something great.
Props to anyone who liked it past 2011.

                Steins;gate. A title that is usually put off as weird, sci-fi anime. From the summary, it seems like it will not go anywhere. A boring story with a weird summary, seems like you decide not watch it? Well you are wrong. To be honest this is one of my personal favourites and deserved a 10. But I thought it was more like a 9.5. A small element that could made it above legendary. I'll tell you later on what it is. Oh yes don't be put off with all the ""geeky nonsense"", it is has minor romance in it that makes it whole lot awesome.
10/10
                  Story
The starting of the anime really makes you dislike it.
Despite the boring starting, you start to realize the starting has a world meaning to it. With a endless paradox and fixable through mind-blowing solutions. It has really an impact in every episode with characters here and there influencing the whole story. Bits and pieces of the story are actually the ones that hold them together. Minor changes can mess up your whole future, and that is what is displayed. A simple redundant microwave turned into a basis for a starting of a new evolution. With conditions and consequences. 
Art 10/10
I really have to say, it is really truly amazing to see such minor details and splendid precision on the characters. I believe that Art can truly turn your whole anime experience around. And this is an example. With the lighting and colour, it looked so surreal yet animated.
Sound 10/10
The OP and the ED really brings on a sense of mystery, a strong upbringing of an important event that will occur; A mind going out of control and then restoring itself. Basically it is awe-inspiring theme and gives you a feeling to actually do something useful in life
Character Development 10/10
In this show, it emphasizes on each character and what they want to be, or rather what they regretted doing in the past. But a strong sense of realization comes on and shows them they are who they are today and they should no longer fear the past or
Being somebody else.
Enjoyment 10/10
Really it is truly amazing. One of a kind experience. Unique.
Overall 10/10 but looking back it feels like a 9.8/10 there about.
I really truly enjoyed it. I believe it is a masterpiece. But a masterpiece that could be only watched once. Obviously, I believe it is perfect. A missing element is that it doesn't make you want to watch it again but when you do it would be amazing but predictable. I feel that the director/mangaka wants this to be an exquisite one-way/watch kind of anime just like the message. But after writing this review I feel it deserved a 10/10 with a message with no irony. A perfect masterpiece like this is only identifable through great and thorough understanding.
Message

                Honestly, I was pumped to watch this. I have watched plenty of anime and was constantly recommended this one. however I was severely underwhelmed and disappointed with the plot. If I had to be blunt, it's boring. If an anime takes half it's episodes to set up the characters and plot, then just makes the main character undo it all in the end, it is not good in my opinion. 
I understand that the main character is supposed to be strange, but for me it was really hard to get into him, and I really disliked Mayuri as well as Moeka. 
The art style and
                  sound/art was fine though, but in all it was really disappointing. It doesn't deserve a rate of anywhere near a 9 but maybe I'm just strange.",3

                Time travel isn't a new concept in the entertainment industry. Many movies, anime, reads, and others are out there. 
Steins;Gate. Almost skipped it because I have no idea what the freakin' title means. So I checked it out in MAL, and surprised to see it in top anime list (#1 back then). So I decided to download and watch it.
First impression: I think it sucks. Back then I was rather new to anime, so I more or less was more of discriminative in art. Compared to what I preciously watched, this seemed to be lacking in color and art. I felt like switching to another
                  anime and delay the watching of this series. But I didn't. Told myself this won't be liked by others and won't be recommended to me by my friend for nothing.
First few episodes are kind of boring: no action, all talk, slow developments. All of them seem irrelevant and unrelated. But little did I know that the small pieces of information from the early episodes will lead to a super climatic climax! Little by little did the mysteries unfold, and deep emotions of sadness, despair, regret, etc engrave onto the hearts of the viewers. Those moments of shock and suspense were indispensable. And as the anime came to an end, it didn't feel lacking at all: perfectly told story, so I thought.
Steins;Gate is so far my most favorite anime. Rewatched it again earlier this year, and yes, this still remains my most favorite anime.",10
"
                When reading negative reviews, I can't help but think that some of these reviewers forget: anime is ultimately supposed to be entertaining. Movies, tv shows, and anime all fall under ""entertainment"" bracket for a reason. If your biggest priority in what you look for in anime is moral epiphanies or life-changing lessons, you're often going to be disappointed. You're much better off reading books, listening to lectures, or experiencing more real life events. Not to say that anime or movies can't give you education or culture, but if a visual medium is not entertaining, it's not a good anime/movie/w/e regardless of its conscious message. Steins;gate
                  is entertaining.
At this point, to make this review worth reading, I want to address what people don't like about it, the most significant one being its slow start and trope characters. I think most people acknowledge it handles the plot that actually deals with time travel well which I agree considering how heavily scrutinized every film about time travel is. As for its flaws--what can I say--it didn't bother me as much as the people who hated it, and at that point, good or bad score depends on how bothered each viewer was by this. I mention it b/c I don't think it would be as bothersome if they came to terms with what anime is about. 
I'm not someone who has watched anime all my life. As a relative ""outsider"" therefore, it's easy to see the unique ""charm"" (perhaps comparative advantage) of anime that makes me go back to this niche every now and then. I hardly approach modern sci-fi anime with a stern ""Minority Report"" tone or ""Blade Runner"" tone because it's the inherent silliness of some characters in anime that I precisely appreciate and what I think stands out versus other visual medium. And that to me was what the first half of steins;gate was about. More importantly, I didn't think Okabe Rintarou was a cookie-cutter protagonist. I thought he was developed well and, towards the end, it really showed that the whole show focused more on Okabe's mental toll of dealing with time travel and his perspective on what is worth changing vs not about ourselves rather than any social commentary or a cautionary tale about time travel itself. As for the other characters, even though they succumb to ""tropes,"" I thought the show made them much more iconic than in other shows. In other words, they entertained and did their purpose as supporting characters. Memorably. One thing that fell under radar is how they cleverly ""showed"" character development by not showing it--when you realize that time travel can change a character by superseding or deleting their past and future, it's quite powerful especially through Okabe's perspective. So for me, I enjoyed the second half like most people, but I also had a fun time with the first half as well, mostly b/c it matched my expectations of what anime entails.
Needless to say, the second half of Steins;gate is compelling. Anime as a whole (especially shonen) usually pulls more deux ex machina than I can handle, but I thought Steins;gate had one of the least forced climax and resolution in a while, precisely due to its impeccable groundwork. It certainly explores the uncomfortable truths of time travel but it never forgets to be quite personal even while maintaining a grander purpose. You'd be surprised how easy it is to be lost in bland butterfly effect fiascos and ""save the world"" cliches in time travel stories.    
As for soundtrack and animation, it has 2 or 3 gems that fits the show well overall and, as stated in my profile, I don't really look into animation much when assessing anime unless it's terrible, which wasn't the case for steins;gate imo.
Ultimately, I personally think Steins;gate, like other popular anime, suffers from unfair criticism. It's expected--every action meets an opposite reaction. Wouldn't necessarily call it nitpicking, but some people enforce much heavier impact on the ""negative"" things about steins;gate when grading while ignoring the many things it got right. Point by point, I think Steins;gate is one of a kind.",9
"
                Ugh, what am I even doing. I must be insane to give such a low mark to Steins;Gate, ""Steins;Gate: the holy grail of time travel anime"". And no, I did understand the story. I am going to get so much hate for this, aren't I.
Story : 5/10
Now, before shitting on Steins;Gate, let me say that the plot up to episode 21 is amazing. No really, I had this anime set as 10/10 before episode 22. The story's hardly predictable, and in no way is it overdone. It takes heavy inspiration from the IRL John Titor ""incident"", and the time relativity theories in Steins;Gate actually make
                  sense in real life.
Now here is where it goes all wrong. Up to episode 21 the plot flawlessly chains itself into a conclusion, and said conclusion, is one of the worst endings to such an amazing set-up I've ever seen. This ending tries so hard to be special, that it just ends up being predictable, forced, unnecessary and bland. From episode 1, I could predict that episode 24 would turn out the way it did. It is really hard to explain this more since that would mean spoiling the ending. So here's a full explanation, with spoilers, for those who want to know :
S;G Up to episode 22 is untangling the mess that fucking around with time caused. It sends a strong message regarding the whole time travel thing. Okabe loses a dear friend because of his selfish desires to change the world with time travel. Episode 13 proves that point with Mayuri's inevitable death, which fills Okabe with despair. The whole show, up to episode 22, after that is trying to fix this mess, trying to prevent this looming death. Every D-mail he has to undo is a choice, for example Feyris has to chose between her own desires of saving her father, or a whole city's life style. The Kiryuu Moeka arc was excellent as well. All this tension builds up to episode 20, in which Okabe, somewhat hope filled realises that he's going to need to make a choice, Mayuri or Kurisu. At this point, the show is actually brilliant. The ending should have focused on this choice. The ending should have been picking between self ignorance and the greater good, just like in Fate/Zero (the life of Kiritsugu's Family, or everybody else). The philosophical solution to this would be absolutely making a single choice, just like in classical ancient greek drama, which the show sticks very closely to. The time represents a divine entity, Okabe the fool that messed with said entity, and Mayuri the punishment that this divine entity bring upon Okabe for doing said things.
Now here's my complaint. Instead of that, instead of leaving things at episode 22 with the solution to the Cornelian dilemma Okabe had to face, Suzu comes out of nowhere, not even after a chain of events, just in the beginning of the episode, and says ""we can still save Kurisu"". Okabe actually starts with ""No, I've made a choice, it's impossible"", which was good, but then *deus ex machina* you can trick the world into thinking Kurisu dies when she doesn't. That means that Okabe is basically the deciding catalyst in what the world does. So it goes from being unable to escape certain death, the inability to do anything, to ""I can fix everything because I can"". That is my big problem. That is the deus ex machina that bothers me. And the way he accomplishes that is also poorly executed. As well as character dialogue past episode 21. Episode 18 had amazing voice acting, that Kiryuu Moeka theme is breath taking, but episode 23 just feels dull and sloppy.
Art : 8/10
Animation was a bit sloppy at times, but that's pretty much it. The art style is very nice.
Sound : 10/10
I need to give credit where credit is due. The voice actors are AMAZING in Steins;Gate. The legendary Kana Hanazawa voices Mayuri, which is a perfect choice of seiyuu. Other great performances were by Gotou Saori who voiced Kiryuu Moeka, especially in episode 18-19. Nothing negative to remark here.
The opening is also very catchy, I haven't skipped it a single time.
Character : 7/10
The characters are great. Every character has a distinct role, and fits that role well. My only problem is Mayuri, who was a bit rushed, and didn't serve a big purpose other than the whole episode 13 to 22 part.
Problem is, I went from liking the characters, to hating them in 2 episodes. Episode 23 feels as if the dialogue was written by a totally different person than the previous 22 episodes, same for the character lines. Again, hard to explain without spoiling.
Enjoyment : 5/10
The curse of the last 2-4 episodes. It's hard to hit a good landing story wise, I acknowledge that, but this feels as if a different author wrote the last 2 episodes. Sadly this is why I don't like Steins;Gate.
Overall : 5/10
Would I recommend the show? Of course I would. This 5/10 is only my opinion, I think that any other person who would watch the show would love it.",5

                As the latest visual novel anime adaption to come out in the anime industry, Steins;Gate goes above and beyond what many of its contemporaries have accomplished.
The main plot of Steins;Gate revolves around the experiments and activities of a certain group of friends who managed to customize their microwave into a machine that could send text messages into the past, and the resulting consequences of their actions as the organization SERN, researches on time traveling, tries to capture them.
While Steins;Gate is a science fiction story, the core of its story was always the characters and it was the science fiction elements that acted as its framework.
                  Most of the story is built upon highly entertaining interactions, as well as wonderful character development that really manages to come through to the audience and elicit empathy. As the story goes on, one cannot help but feel the desire to root for the cast to succeed.
On the production side of things, the budget certainly could have been better, as the anime's visuals sometimes lacked the impact I felt they deserved. The audio was generally very good, but not spectacular. What really shined through though was the quality of directing. The way the camera moves around during certain climax scenes, and the use of the few stand out songs from the sound track managed to bring out the best of certain climax moments throughout the show's run.
Another thing that most certainly should not be forgotten is the quality of the voice acting in this show, especially that of Okabe's voice actor, Miyano, Mamoru. Miyano's performance in this show seriously deserves a standing ovation. The sheer emotion he managed to express in his role was chilling. It really helped in engaging the audience during key scenes.
One thing that must be appreciated in this anime is studio White Fox's ability to adapt the story well. Too many times in the anime industry have we seen a combination of poor planning, production values, and an inability to stay faithful to the source material ruin an otherwise quality source material. Coming into this anime it was hard to not be wary of the same problems arising due to its predecessor Chaos;Head being an absolutely terrible adaption.Thankfully, Steins;Gate manages to trump the usual issues of many other visual novel adaptions, earning its place as a very enjoyable anime.
Overall, while Steins;Gate is not a hard core science fiction story, it manages to bring enough intrigue plot wise while balancing out a very endearing character driven story. The amusing character interactions manage to make sure that the story never becomes stale, and its build up to its most shining moments always draws you in for more. Steins;Gate has it least in my book earned its way as one of the most impressive visual novel adaptions to date.",9
"
                Not often will I find myself reviewing an anime, but in this case I felt it was well deserved, this show is truly a well presented piece of art that I will do my best to  do justice to. Surely your know before even glancing down at the reviews section, this show is about time travel, if you are like me and watched Haruhi's endless eight all the way through, you are already feeling nervous for this show, but I assure you, all that worry is for naught.
Story: 10/10
The story is truly the best selling point of any anime, and going into this one
                  with high hopes I initially found myself extremely let down and originally dropped it after the third episode, however I did eventually pick it back up again from the beginning, and thank goodness for that! The plot follows the adventures of your resident mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!!! A.K.A Rintarou Okabe A.K.A Okarin. At first this character childish, almost aloof nature is rather annoying, and the show starts lighthearted enough that I really well and truly had no idea what to expect, but things certainly take a turn for the worse, and how could they not whenever time travel is introduced. Something I feel must be touched on as well is the time travel mechanic itself, it is all well thought out and involves differing world lines, never once do you feel like the show merely uses the time travel mechanic to cheat, every single action taken has a consequence associated to it, nothing comes easy. Throughout the whole story the organization SERN plays a major part, as they are trying to discover time travel for themselves, though they aren't the only antagonist, Okarin himself is an issue interestingly enough. It's hard to really give you a good feel for the story without ruining any of the plot twists, which are abundant I assure you. But I will say, this anime is so masterfully presented, throughout it things will suddenly click, or old pieces of information you discarded as nothing will be a huge part of the picture, there are questions you'd never think to ask answered, and overall the ending feels good, nothing feels out of place, and all the loose ends are tied up for the most part, and as we all know, an ending can make or break a show!
Art: 9/10
The art style is simple and mellow, almost like a fine wine, nothing feels overtly over the top and there is no real ""special effects"" type of animation in play. It all feels very believable which lends to this storys credibility. While many might find this a ""lazy"" style I myself quite like it.
Sound: 7/10
The sound is a rather strange issue in this anime, the intro and ending themselves are beautiful, but there is no memorable score during the actual anime, at times this silence lended to the intensity of the scene, but other times I felt almost robbed of climactic music.
Character: 10/10
So if you want to know about the characters, please see their biographys, Ill simply be talking about development here!
The characters and their interactions all felt very natural, progression was all nice and easy, and despite being initially annoyed by some characters, they all started to grow on me! All the backstories given to us were masterfully done, and some of them were even startling in their intensity, you truly forget you are watching anime, and merely watch their lives unfold before your very eyes. It is always a double edged sword when characters are presented so beautifully you can't help but love them, it makes the series 10x better yes, but to leave them behind is a horrible feeling, these people you have come to love in a sense will be forever locked in time and theres nothing you can do to spend just a couple more minutes with them sadly. Each of their characters is truly unique, and none feel out of place or uneeded.
All in all, these series will take you for a ride you aren't soon to forget, I haven't enjoyed an anime this much in quite a while and I implore you to watch it, you certainly won't regret it, none of the hype is overdone, it deserves every bit of the praise and acclaim it has earned for itself.

                * Spoilers ... Not that many , but they are still here * 
Where should i begin ? That this is one of the best SF anime's out there ? Or should i ask first  if  this could've been even better that it already is ? 
Well it doesn't really matter where i start , the grand idea is the same , even if the anime followed the game even more closely than it already had the outcome would've been the same , there will never be another masterpiece like this . 
Story 10 
Here i guess almost all of us are of
                  the same opinion , the story was the core of this show , time-traveling is one of the least used ideas in the anime industry and i am happy about that . 
And for the most obvious reason why this show deserves a 10 is the originality of it . Lets be honest in what universe can you make a time machine with a microwave and a phone ? Not in ours at least , plus i liked the whole SERN thing . 
Characters 9 
Here is the mini core of the show , the characters are unique in their way , the self proclaimed Mad Scientist that is followed by some organization , the Super Hacka - , sorry , Super Hacker that has a lot of 2D wifes and of course the airheaded childhood friend who likes to dress almost everyone in her home made cosplay costumes . Of course we can't forget about the tsundere assistant Christina . 
Well i will be honest , if the trap-like character didn't exist the characters would've deserved a 10 . 
Art / Animation 9 
Not something out of the ordanary , but not ugly either , perfect for this kind of anime i guess . Not the over the top colours that can be seen in every day anime , as i said earlier perfect for this show . 
Animation wise now , it was good all the time not the kind that makes the characters or the enviorment look like it was drawn by a 4 year old when there is some action ... *cough* Naruto *cough*  ... ah this cold is getting to me . 
Sound 10 
What cought my eye ... hmm ... ear is better said , lets rephrase , what cought my ear was the OP and ED songs , don't ask for the name of the songs , but what can i say is that now i have them in my YT playlist . 
Enjoyment 10 
As i wrote in my previous review i like original stories that don't have that don't have romance between childhood friends and stupid interactions among other characters and this anime did just what i wanted , gave me a SF story about time traveling , a tsundere character and romance between characters that don't know each other since almost birth. 
Overall 9.6 / 10 
I have to say that i enjoyed this anime to its fullest , for that i will give it a 10 . 
This is something that needs to be watched once , after that rewatched and finally if you can , play the game you will not regret it .",10

                Great storytelling requires great characters to lead a viewer through. This is where Steins;Gate failed.
The characters are literally screaming: ""Look how unique and original I am!"", just like an annoying store consultant talks you into buying an ordinary microwave; ""Tuturu!"" and the main character's ""paranoia"" and talking through a dead phone are just a few examples. But this is not the worst part, which is the main character, which I can definitely award the title of the worst character development ever. A genius who invented a time machine yet is degenerate to an extent that he allows an absolute stranger to use the time machine
                  to alter the past! I know people are not perfect and so are anime characters, but this is absurd. This makes the character unrealistic and unrelatable. This makes the story unbearable to watch.",3
"
                What can I say about Steins;Gate that hasn't already been said?
I came across this anime perchance, simply because I was bored and flipping through anime recommendations.  Boy, am I glad I did.
The only reason I wont give this a 10 is because I have a hard time labeling anything as a ""masterpiece"" no matter how well its done.  But I have to say, this comes pretty darn close.
Steins;Gate has made it into my list of all time favorite anime.  It appeals to a wide range of audiences, from your Death Note watchers to your shoujo fans. The characters are lovable, the relationship
                  dynamics are endearing, and the story leaves nothing to be desired.
As with any time travel/dimension travel story, bits of it get a little tangled and confusing.  Its hard to avoid plot holes when messing with time.  But this anime is so good it manages to quell any issues you might have with time travel plot holes.
I, as much as anyone else, am hesitant about the hype of fanboys and girls; but, ladies and gentlemen, listen to them this time. Watch this anime. You WILL NOT regret it.",9
"
                The most impressive part about this anime is that, everything starts to connect together and makes sense for what this anime had confused me for the first few episodes. In fact, you shall be amazed by how creative and how smart the author is to come up with such an amazing plot. 
My advice to people who want to start off this anime is this : Do not drop this anime until you have watched episode 4 or so. It's true that the first episode give so much confusion to us and many random things, if not, come out one after another. At first, I
                  was like what the hell is going on? But the truth is, to me, you need concentration to watch this anime, because you'll find most of the details from the earlier episodes are explained in the latter episodes. *You'll know what I mean after you watch it.* 
In fact, I watched Steins;Gate for the 2nd time to catch up what I have missed, and find it reasonable and impressive at the same time. And therefore, for people who like this kind of twisted and problem-solving anime, I would definitely recommend you Steins;Gate. Until now, I haven't find any people, if not, who dislike this anime. Seriously, if someone doesn't like this anime, there is something wrong with them. It's not biased but it's a damn fact it's awesome and plot-wise. 
One more thing, for people like me who like tsundere a lot, this anime is definitely your ultimate choice. There's this tsundere girl, Makise Kurisu, in my opinion, is the most perfect tsundere in this universe! I mean, her personality is really balanced in every aspect; we always find that male characters are always getting beaten up badly by tsundere, or relatively afraid of the tsundere if they were mad, etc. Makise Kurisu in this case is completely different. I wouldn't tell you more about this, you should really watch yourselves. 
Overall, this is in fact the best of the best animes I've seen in my anime life :D So, give it a try.",9
"
                I have always loved the subject of time travel ever since I was young. Time travel is also really hard to write about (ask community's dean pelton if you don't believe me). You have to consider all the paradoxes that would be cretaed and think of rules to do with them. That's why I love Doctor Who so much because of the way that it uses time travel while still managing to give really good stories.
The connection you make with Okabe and Makise determines whether you love or hate this tale. These two are the driving force behind Steins;Gate. Admittedly, I found both characters instantly
                  likable (some of my favorites of all time) and fell into the emotional spider web that this show weaves afterwards if you decide to love it. If you, like me, manage to fall into this web, then you will cry when they cry, you will hate when they hate and you will find yourself sucked completely into this mystery from start to finish and enjoy every second of it.
This is one of the few shows I have watched that has got an amzing rewatch bonus. Every episode you rewatch you will notice something new. This just shows how much work was out into it as each time you rewatch it you will see something different you may have missed previously. Even things in episode 1 are rewatch bonuses.
If you are the kind of person who gets confused by time travel and paradoxes or you feel the need to have every little thing explained to you I don't recommend this show to you. This show feels as if the writers acknowledge that us the viewers are smart enough to understand what's happening with the plot.
I have given this show a 10 because I truly believe it is the greatest anime I have ever watched and the tear jerkers are basically a 10/10.",10
"
                If you put this anime on hold or dropped it after the first episode for whatever reason, let me tell you the same thing someone told me when discussing this show: ""It's one of the few anime I've seen that gets so much better every episode."" Come on, now, your curiosity gotta be peaked a little bit, no?
Steins;Gate delivers a story that pulls you in out of nowhere and leaves you suspended over its world, watching every corner of it. I realized how invested in the series I grew only after the fact. In the beginning, the story interested me slightly, but not to the
                  point that I'd stay up 'til four in the morning watching it and dying to see every next episode. By the time I got to episode five, I reached that point exactly. And, no, it ain't one of those shows where it's so interesting you lose track of time and suddenly you think, ""Oh, fuck, it's four in the morning! What am I doing??"" No, with this show, you know exactly how late it is and you could not care less. You can't help yourself from clicking on the next episode. The story will leave you that captivated.
I could write pages on the plot alone, but I think it's best to just tell you what you get with this show and leave the details for you to see on your own. Steins;Gate definitely exemplifies a fantastic execution of a thrilling series. It keeps you on edge with intricate plot points and existential themes delivered in an astoundingly entertaining way. You really experience this show. It's a train ride of masterfully made storytelling and you'll want it to rush on until the last stop.
The art looked very good. It seemed well thought-out and deliberate. It wasn't breathtaking, but well done and in style with the atmosphere of the show. The character art also appears fairly unique, which I think great. A number of anime recently seem to possess pretty much the same character designs for one or two people. I liked the background art, but Steins;Gate didn't really use that much of it anyway - the characters frequent the same few locations throughout most of the show after all.
The opening theme fit the show well and starts to grow on you after about the third episode. The ending and rest of the soundtrack worked about the same.
The writers created a largely likeable group of characters who many people will find easy to relate to. They pulled off the development for almost all of the characters really well and kept pretty fair pacing.
As you can probably tell by now, a definite is writing this review. But, I started out uninterested and, on top of that, I would not go for anything in the sci-fi genre. Seriously, this is a fantastic show. You should totally watch this shit.",10
"
                (Major spoilers ahead)
What was the point? 
I don't remember 90% of what happened in the first 12 episodes because the storytelling was so unfocused, meandering, and confusing. Aside from Okabe and Suzuha, all of the characters were stale caricatures of anime cliches - the tsundere, the moe, the pervy NEET, etc. Screentime was wasted on scenes that did nothing to advance the plot or build character in a meaningful way, ex. Okabe's date with Ruka taking up a whole episode so we'll feel extra bad for her. Even the comedic parts were unfunny, especially the persistent reminders that Hashida is horny 24/7; his character was
                  fine without the borderline sexual harassment.
I wanted to drop after episode 12, but I kept watching because I've heard this anime has a slow start. But it just got worse. The middle arc could be summarized as Okabe making a chain of frankly idiotic decisions that he has to spend the rest of the season undoing. You would think after the first few D-mails didn't work out properly, especially after Moeka's D-mail backfired, Okabe would think twice about messing with timelines. So what does he do? Send another D-mail. Character motivations in general were forced into molds that allowed the plot to move in a certain direction. Kurisu's father stabbing Okabe is a prime example of this - we're expected to believe a highly intelligent and educated man would resort immediately to violence to oppose his rivals in a public place, risking his entire career, instead of employing subtler methods. The fact that he took out a knife before Okabe provoked him means it can't even be excused as a crime of passion.
Worldbuilding was also glossed over as a convenient plot device. SERN was barely explored - for instance, where did it get funding to provide livelihoods for its agents? How was it able to commit blatant crimes (through its agents, not by time travel) without attracting attention? How did SERN even know Okabe would successfully create a time machine, so early on that they planted FB to watch him? Why was a random picture of a creepy doll texted to Okabe? What was the purpose of discovering that time traveling humans turned to jelly if memories could be transferred instead? The point is, worldbuilding was used to serve the plot when it should have been the other way around, resulting in a bunch of seemingly random and unnecessary details.
The core problem of this anime is its storytelling, which is a shame because Steins;Gate's one redeeming quality is that the themes it explores are actually quite compelling. Okabe's character development through the lessons he learned about the dangers of time travel could have truly shone, if handled with better storytelling. Yet all of that development, all the suffering he endured to learn those lessons, is thrown out the window by having Okabe resolve the central conflict with another time travel deus ex machina. What's worse is that his ultimate motivation was saving a girl he liked without any regard for the fate of the world. Apparently - and Okabe implies this himself - the world could burn as long as his friends survived.
The deus ex machine itself doesn't make sense, either. Just because his past self believes the past hasn't changed, doesn't mean the past actually hasn't changed. And nothing suggests that his past self wouldn't restart the cycle of events from the beginning of the season in an endless loop. 
So, back to my first question: what was the point? This anime would be two episodes long if not for Okabe's reckless actions. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the #2 highest MAL rated anime more if I was invested in the characters. Either way, this time the hype let me down.",5

- William Shatner
With the constant breakthroughs in modern day physics, time travel has become one of the most present topics in theoretical physics discussions. It may be just a fantasy, or maybe a dream. But, be it a dream, a
                  human dream, like the dream to fly, will it ever lead the way and inspire minds to fulfill it? To build an airplane capable of flying through the mists of time?
Even though I am no theist, I cannot find a better answer for now than ""only god knows"".
But then what happens?
What happens when human ingenuity breaks the barrier of time?
That is exactly what this unique piece of japanese animation deals with. It's a unparalleled story about time travel. It deals with the consequences of time travel, its paradoxical nature and a love so strong that surpasses time itself.
I do realise I may have gone a bit over the top with my rating, especially since the time travel mechanisms are a bit sketchy. That is why I ask you willingly suspend your disbelief and enjoy this awe-inspiring story.
Without a doubt, the best japanese anime I have ever seen, and, forever, my favourite one.",10

                Steins;Gate review by yours truly.
Time machine, leaping through time, time traveler, changing the past, see the future, also Deus Ex Machina. One might call it Bull;Shit
Everyone always seems to amazed by someone who talk about science. Some people understand and some people don't understand. People who understand will start an arguement and people who don't understand simply don't care. In all seriousness I don't give a crap. Science is bullshit I don't like it period. Oh wait I can make an exception if it's regarding how to make a 12 year old girl stay 12 forever. hmmm... delicious~
Story: ~How to make a green banana~
1. Visit
                  porn site.
2. A [insertyourdicksize] cm banana is ready.
3. Put a green condom on the banana.
MAMA MIA!
Seriously, I'm confused. I don't understand jackshit! Tutturu~What's the point of her existence? How the hell a tsundere become a scientist? Tsundere are stupid. 'slap' i-it's not like i want you to touch my boobs or anything b-baka! 'slap again'  do you want me to touch yer boobs or don't you? jeez make up ur mind!
Art and Animation: The eye designs were ugly as hell.
Sound: Adding ''nyann'' in every fuckin' sentence... pandering(hip start movin' and she's screamin' and moan nyann all the time), fap a little if you know what I mean sir... and also tutturu~ 10/10 would fap again.
Character:

Tsundere scientist: Hawt!
Tutturu~ bitch: Trust me she's not a virgin.
Fat-sweaty ass otaku: Represent all otakus in the universe.
Nyann cat: 10/10 would bang
Gender confuse: I met him/her in Thailand also not a virgin.
The directing superb because TEXHNOLYZE!
Enjoyment: Well, I did enjoy it. Re-watch? Nah.",5

                This show has ruined all other anime for me.
 I will always be a bit disappointed, because very few will ever hold a candle up to this masterpiece.
Story ~ 10/10
The story alone is worthy of my ""Overall"" 10/10 rating. Basically, it is about a self-proclaimed mad scientist and his friends who accidentally make a time machine of sorts. The story follows the consequences of his and others actions. It starts off simple and lighthearted, which was very misleading. I thought it was just a really interesting comedy at first. But as time goes on, it becomes deeper, more complex and really gets you thinking. The
                  complete and total divergence from the initial feeling was important though. Because it is what the story is about at heart; the consequences of curiosity. Steins;Gate never once faltered in it's progression or quality. It maintained a steady pace and a consist story that never once disappointed. I was gripping on to every moment, (each moment prolonged to extreme degrees, thanks to my terrible internet connection) I needed to know what would happen next. 
Art ~ 8/10
The artwork was nothing to shout from the mountaintops about, but it got the job done and was eye pleasing. I liked the realistic look at that it had, as a cutesy ""typical"" anime look would most definitely distract from the story. The atmosphere that it provided was perfect and nothing seemed out of place.
Sound ~ 8/10
Once again, nothing overly fantastic. But what was provided fit every scene extremely well. The opening theme was really great and captured the feeling of the show. (**Kind-of Spoiler**) It basically spelled out everything that was to come in the series. For example, ""...That drives my will to go beyond the World Lines, in order to preserve that smile of yours. Once more, into a temporal loop devoid of sorrow...""Thankfully, it really flew over my head (and probably others too), because it made no sense without the context to put it in.
Character ~ 10/10
The characters in Steins;Gate were one of it's driving forces. What is a story without characters that capture your heart?  Okabe is our main character, he's a bit delusional and silly, but a good, caring friend nonetheless. Mayuri is so sweet and innocent, you can't help but adore her. Everyone knows a guy like Daru, the perverted tech-geek.  And Kurisu ""Christina"" Makise is the temperamental genius that changes everything. The characters are all written to have realistic actions and reactions. They stay within their character and have very little development. But development was not necessary. The exception is Okabe, who is most definitely changed by his experiences.
Enjoyment ~ 10/10
I've already said it all. I gripped onto every moment of this series. I liked the artwork. The sound was good. I fell so deeply in love with the characters. The story was fantastic and extremely well done, never once did it falter. Even if science-fiction isn't your cup of tea, it is still worth watching. I am normally not much of a fan either.  It has everything you could want out of a story of any kind.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is my favorite anime yet. The way I experienced this serie will be very difficult to explain in words, if they even exist. First off all I would like to have it about the baddest part of the serie. The first six episodes where probably the most boring ones I ever saw. It took me like five months to finish it. After that I saw the rest of the serie in two days though. I guess the introduction to the characters and the story takes some time. But it is absolutely needed to understand the rest of the serie.
I don‚Äôt think you have to
                  know a lot about the story. Just that Okabe (that proclaimed himself as the ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù) incidentally invented a microwave that can sent messages to the past.
I can understand that you have the feeling now of ‚Äúwhat for a stupid story is this?‚Äù. Since I had the same feeling during the first six episodes. The story becomes interesting when he starts messing with the past and especially when he tries to make up for it with messing with it again. So the first time where he is messing with the past is in episode seven. It is unbelievable how the story upgrades from there. Especially the way every episode (from seven) surpasses the one before it. What gives the most unbelievable end you can ever imagine!!! It is pretty difficult to explain why the story is that good since the starter is kinda boring and everything I would tell over the rest is spoiling. But just try to believe me and see for yourself (if you haven‚Äôt already). Cause it is really the best part of the serie and you won‚Äôt easily find a plot like that in a serie. 
To be honest I don‚Äôt like Sci-fi. However it didn‚Äôt feel like that. This feels and actually is more like the way we live today. Just with the detail someone has the power of such a machine. Their theory of time traveling is so fascinating, realistic. That it is like it really can exist. The basic theory behind it is ‚Äútimelines‚Äù. It basically is like when you‚Äôve changed something in the past. If what you‚Äôve changed had any influence (That something happened what shouldn‚Äôt happened or even something not happened while it should‚Äôve happened) that has change history. You come in another timeline. Where everybody thinks it always was like that. So all their memories are from that past. Here is the special power (the power of steiner) that Okabe has. The power to remember what happened before the timelines changed.
The characters are very good and well developed. Especially the part where he messes with the timelines in a certain way. Because only Okabe knew what happened before that. While the others had the feeling that never happened. This gives a weird way of a bond, cause they're not based on the same facts. Just take as example that you had a person in the past and at that point you hate each other. But later you made up the problems with him/her and became friends. Once you where open for each other, you see how great the person is and you simply fell in love with each other. But the other day he/she forgot about these last 2 weeks as it never happened. Your love will probably be the same while she is back to the time she still hates you. The way the characters react on such things is just superb. The little emotional dramas are simply insane on both sides. The way Okabe handles and how these persons react on it over and over again. Lets you understand the characters even better as the characters understands themselves. So in my opinion everything is well developed however the order seems a bit weird. But the way everything of the personages becomes a bit by a bit clear can make the serie on its own.Then imagine what happens if you use this technique on insane good characters. Well that is Steins;Gate! Explaining why they are so good characters is again difficult because they aren‚Äôt like that yet in the beginning. Guess it will be difficult, but you just need to trust me for those facts.
Now the most important things are said, it is times for the minor details. The drawings aren‚Äôt special and there aren‚Äôt insanely good action drawings or something like that however the drawstyle fits the story perfectly and the design of the characters is pretty good and original. The Ost isn‚Äôt that special either. However ‚ÄúGate Of The Steiner‚Äù gives me goosebumps every time I hear it and the intro song did became my favorite of all time. the intro song is again not so special in the beginning. But once you‚Äôre at the end of the serie. You will understand the song perfectly and probably like it. The voice-acting wasn‚Äôt special but just as the drawings it fits the story what let it sound like it is that special. This principle is actually the same with the drawings.
I hope my review is good enough to let you watch it if you haven‚Äôt already because every seinen lover has to see this serie or if you have already seen it, that you simply liked my review and/or it had summoned those feelings from back then again. If you aren‚Äôt in one of these groups thanks for reading though.",10

                There is a rumor of Anime getting worse and worse in the last years, losing it‚Äôs niveau and only producing shows that are storywise and characterwise of a lot lower quality then earlier shows. And tehre is a rumor of a few shows considered as the ‚ÄúSaving graces of modern Anime‚Äù (Shoutout to HoldenReviews!), including shows such as Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magika, Fate/Zero and the show that I am wanting to Review right now. Steins;Gate!
Story: Steins;Gate takes place in the year of 2010, in the part of Tokyo called Akihabara. Here our main protagonist Okabe Rintarou, also known as Hououin Kyouma, lives in a small
                  laboratory together with his two lab members Hashida Itaru, aka Daru and Shiina Mayuri. Together (or actually mostly Okabe and Daru) they modified their microwave into a device that is able to send textmessages into the past. One day Rintarou accidently uses it after finding a dead woman that he talked to only minutes ago. After he goes through a weird process he finds out, that the woman he thought was dead is still alive, leading to massive confusion.
The story of Steins;Gate is in my opinion definitely the strongest point of the Anime, including more twists and turns than most Anime that I have seen so far, setting it up as really complex and well thought through story! One thing that many people do complain about watching this show though, is that it starts incredibly slow, only explaining things and only shifts into the serious part rather late. In my opinion though, the pacing for the first episodes was perfect and if they would have tried to make it only a little faster everything would have felt incredibly rushed leaving a start that would have been a lot worse. I also like that they get a lot of the explaining out of the way early, not having to explain things later on. As soon as they are done with this though, the really serious part starts and shit begins to hit the fan, with more and more twists happening and more and more drama involved, as the Anime gets really dark.
9.3/10
Characters: Steins;Gate for me is a perfect example that character developement is not a hundred percent necessary in a show, as long as the characters remain interesting! The whole time travelling theme makes character developement hard to execute and that is why the only character that really changes throughout the show is the time traveller itself, being Okabe. Still every single character the show introduces is being given attention to and they do get a lot of depht in the course of the show, making for an incredibly strong suppoting cast, in that every single character is likeable and relateable to.
The main character of the show Okabe Rintarou, must be one of the mose interesting characters that I have see in quite some time, calling himself a mad scientist and giving everything and everyone weird nicknames, he definitely seems to be a little weird in his head at first, but it‚Äôs not that late, until you realize, that he actually is a character that really cares for others.
The second main character being Okabe‚Äôs childhood friend Shiina Mayuri. She is mostly shown as the cute little girl, that is a little clumsy and maybe not always as smart, but it is really refreshing to see her interaction with Okabe, since she always seems to commit herself to his jokes. Even though she almost never is really doing anything, she still has a huge roll in the overall plot.
The third and last main character is Makise Kurisu, a young woman, that is currently studying just as Okabe is. She at first is convinced that time travel is absolutely not possible, until she randomly comes to Okabe and wittnesses his experiments. Even though she saw what happened in this laboratory she still is not convinced and only slowly, as the plot begins to move forward she starts believing in the experiments and that what happened was time travel. The best thing about her must be her interaction with Okabe, since she is a tsundere (pretty much the most likeable one I‚Äôve seen) and opposes almost everything her lab partner says. Seeing them arguing really never is boring.
The whole character cast in Steins;Gate is really well balanced. Adding depht to every single character, the Anime does a really good job in building up relationships and showing interactions between characters. The only problem there is, being the character developement, which is impossible due to the time travelling, is not solved by overshadowed by the sheer amount of well written characters that it almost doesn‚Äôt matter.
8.7/10
Art: The Animation of Steins;Gate has been handled by White Fox, the company that was responsible for shows like the recent Hataraku Maou Sama and a show called Jormungand. The Animation in total was really good and fluent, the backgrounds were really detailed and always fit the shows theme, while at first brighter, they got a lot darker near the end of the shwo which only gave the darker part a lot more feeling to it.
7.5/10
Sound: The Soundtrack has been handled by Takeshi Abo and Murakami Jun, who both don‚Äôt really have any other major works besides Steins;Gate (Robotics;Notes for Takeshi Abo). The OST is actually pretty well done, something I only realized after actually listening to it myself. It already helped building the atmosphere of the Show, but now that I really listen to it, I really enjoy it much more than I thought! It mostly consists of pieces that are rather quiet and those really are the best part of it. While the ones that are a bit more lighthearted are nicely done, they are nothing that I would listen to a lot myself. The voice acting in Steins;Gate is for the Japanese part superbe. While my Japanese is not good enough to actually understand everything, the emotions that are supposed to be brought to the viewer are done really well. For the ending and Opening, the Ending is really good, featuring one of my favourite japanese songs, even though the animation in it is rather boring. The Opening on the other hand, has music that is just as good, but Animation that stands out in a lot of ways and makes for one of the best Openings I had the pleasure to listening to.
8.4/10
In total Steins;Gate a show that should not be missed, not only presenting a plot that has amazingly many twists, well executed characters, but also shining in it‚Äôs presentation. I can‚Äôt recommend buying this Anime to those who have access to it enough, since this is worth every single cent you‚Äôll be paying. After calculating every single score I gave (the ones above + my personal enjoyment), I ended up rating this Anime with an incredibly strong 8.74/10",9
"
                One of the few ""genuinely"" funny anime that I've watched; what I mean by that is it wasn't some conditioned, in-the-know, humor being used that only frequent and savvy anime watchers would get, it was humor that anyone can get.
Story & Character: The story is a blend of almost sitcom-like scenarios and sci-fi themes that comes together into quite the show. Thoroughly fleshed out cast, however plagued with a certain ~nya character that almost certainly can be given the ""Weakest Link"" award.
Art & Sound: I liked the music a lot, it helped the scenes rather than hurt them. The art, in retrospect, seemed dulled and
                  lackluster and probably needed a more vibrant color pallet.
Enjoyment: I have only fond memories of this anime and I would recommend it to anyone.",9
"
                In the end after, 2 years of trying, I managed to watch this series... Taking in consideration that it got a lot of 10, and is 2nd place on MAL, is obvious that I had big expectations... and so you do my dear reader. So, is Steins;Gate truly a masterpiece ? I dont know. I know a thing, this anime is far from perfection, like is aclaimed to be. Peoples say SAO is overrated, SNK is overrated, Naruto is overrated... today I say, Steins;Gate is pretty overrated too. To be honest I've been quite dissapointed, that why I decided to make this review. And I
                  will make it for both peoples who intend to watch it and for those who had seen it.
 Story: 7 (more like 6,5 trough)
Steins;Gate is definetly an unique anime on a market full of so much cliche. Personally, I never saw an anime about time travel, and never heard of one (if there are, excuse my lack of knowlege). The story follows Okabe Kentarou, a self claimed ''Mado Scientisto'', his 2 friends Daru and Mayushi, and their adventures in their laboratory, in which they try to create awsome gadgets... but they arent very talented... even so, by a miracle, they end up creating by accident a time machine, more exactly  a gadget with which they can send SMS in past. From there the story is quite confussing, and shit happens for about 9 episodes (so bear with it). After 9 episodes trough, you start to recive answers (more or less), and the anime transform in a quite good thriller/mistery. That is all the information I can give without entering in spoilers.
 So is it good or bad ? Well the anime is definetly something quite different from from what we seen on the market in the last period of time (excepting the quite typical  characters: tsundere girl, moe genki girl, neko girl, trap, dere and otaku). Is quite enjoyable, and the comedy is good. The MC is really unique. Even in the confussing 9 episodes you wont get bored, is a good anime. But even if the ideea is good, it has to many flaws... Basically this anime is a bunch of plot holes, and Deus Ex Machina, which is used many times in anime, but the problem is the in this anime the Deus Ex Machina is quite hardcore and is used in the most crucial moments, and if only one would miss the story would fall apart. If you think this anime would be a great element for Geek-Land, like Doctor Who, you will be dissapointed. The story gets some scientifical elements but the execution lacks... I dont know, a geek writer ? The whole concept of time travel is very confusing and many times lacks logic. 
Characters: 9
Like I said the characters are very typical, but they are pretty well executed. The MC, Okarin, is badass like hell and very charismatic, with few pussy moments at some point but he is still cool... I mean what can be more interesting than a ''scientist'' with chuunibyou ? Mayushi, is the normal genki girl, with moe elements that you will fall in love with for some reason. Daru... yeah, is ok too, nothing special trough. Kurisu is the pridefull tsundere, that has a tons of characteristics for her age (genius, tsundere, moe, otaku, etc.), but you would definetly like her even if you hate tsundere as she isn't a hardcore one; we have Ferys the Nya~Nya girl > < that you will hate or love; Moeka, the dere anti-social girl, Ruka the trap, Suzuha the girl with the best story, and few others.
You will fell attached to them, you will definetly give a fuck or 2 on their situations, so there aren't complains.
Sound: 8
 The OP is awsome, is in my play list long before I watched the anime. The ED isnt memorable trough, is the same for the soundtracks too.
Art: 8
The art is cheap, is not an anime with big budget. The colors are dark, the character design is quite simple. Even so the art is very suited to the anime.
Enjoyment 8
In the last 2 years I gave up one my old hardcore marathon-like way of watching anime. 2 years ago I would watch this in less than 2 day. Now it took me almost 2 weeks. The main reason is the fact that I discovered manga, which is almost allways better than the anime adaptations, and take me less time to finish one. Another reason is that 2 years ago, I started watch anime in family (together with my 18 years old little brother, another 9 years old brother and my kind of an otaku 12 years old sister), as a result I ended up doing something I would not do in the past... rewatch anime. That why in present, my grade of enjoyment with an anime is rated by the question: ''Will you rewatch this?'' and most importantly, are you ready to sacrifice the 3 hours program (yeah I have a program now) to rewatch the series ? For this anime, the answer is NO. Even if I would marathon it to try to understand the things I didn't understand, I see this as an anime you watch once in a life time (but maybe i will play the game). The anime was enjoyable, and where 3-4 episodes where I really couldn't wait to see what happens next, but, the first 9 episodes where confusing, many reviews said there is where the confusion ends, but they lied... the whole show was confusing, expecially the last episode, where I tried to find a logical explanation but I failed, because there is none. The show is not boring, but there to many elements, for 24 episodes, I know this is made after a VN, but that game has over 30 hours lenght.
Overall:
DO I RECOMAND THIS ? Yes! As a logical being I couldn't not feel a punch in the face by the flaws in the logic and plot holes this anime delivers... but this is me. I wouldn't bothered with this review if I wouldn't had seen so many review calling this anime as perfect (which is not). You may find this as a masterpiece too, like many others. Even if is not perfect, Steins;Gate is definetly an anime that will remain in history. And is an ejoyable show that doesen't fail to make you laught or even cry, that why I will make a list with Pros and Cons:
PRO: 
- Even if they aren't unique,  the character are really well done. You will connect with them, you will fell sorry for them, cry or be happy for them, hate them or love them. And Okabe is awsome.
- Drama. Is not forced and is very good... I really feelt like shit after Suzuha Arc Q.Q
-Comedy, it manged to make me and my brother laught from the first episode, right after we finished NouCome... so is good.
- Thriller. It wasn't what I expected, but it definetly keept us hooked.
- Originality... Have you saw the Anime Winter 2014-2015 Chart ? When you have so much cliche (5 anime have basically the same story), it makes you apreciate niche like S;G. Is an unique anime, and I really hope someone is going to be inspired and make a better one with a symilar ideea.
CONS:
-Plot holes
-hardcore Deus Ex Machina
-Logic flaws
-Lack of crucial explanation about some important elements that don't necessary have something to do with science... 
Overall: 8
Now, like I said in the begining, I am going to make this review for peoples who intend to watch this and for the ones who aleardy watched. For the last ones I will make a short list with the most important flaws, so they can understand that I am not really butthurt, and I actually have reasons for why  I think this is overrated:
ATENTION HARDCORE SPOILERS, DONT READ THIS IF YOU HAVENT WATCHED THE ANIME YET!!!!
-The biggest Deus Ex Machina is the statelite that fell on Akihabara. The story take place in 3 weeks, time in which the statelite is left there. In any normal situation, the autorities would come isolate the area, because is dangerous, that thing can fall in someones head... But here we talk about a statelite, the secret services and police would be there in few minutes and take it, because it has advanced tehnology that should not fall in wrong hands, and if is not japanese is even more important to take it from there, to see what it is... Plus, that thing is supposed to fall from the space but is still intact, so this mistery would make the authorities even more courious. The fact that it would be took fast is shown by Suzuha too in 23 episode when he said to Okabe to hurry as she can't let the time machine there for too long.
-When Suzu goes back in 1975 and lost her memories, the statelite/time machine is left behind, as a result it would be definetly took over by the autorities, who in the end they will find out that is not a statelite but is actually a time travel machine. Having in their hand the time travel tehnology since then, the present in which the action happens, should be different... as we know in Suzuha time line SERN took over the world, and in the other one the WWIII started. PLOT HOLE
- Okabe's time machine is ridiculous, and why and how does the TV play the role to help, was never explained. As for what was the banana gel they wanted to make was supposed to be (I am courious). ILOGIC and UNEXPLAINED PLOT
- Ignoring the fact that they are able to create very easly a machine that transfer memories, with their low buget (I remeber that even bananas where expensive for them), a tehnology that is researched at this moment and has millions of dollars as budget, and the fact that Okabe manage to escape very easy from Moeka and use the time machine to jump in time many times, there is a big annoying problem... at some point Okabe leaps in past, even before creating the memory transfer gadget, but that doesen't stops him from making other leaps. There is not explained if they create it again or what the heck happens. PLOT HOLE
- Ruka is born as a girl because her mother eats only vegetables... Wut O O ?! ILOGIC
- They had send more D-Mails than they cancel, for example the lottery ticket,  is not said if it was canceled. CONFUSING
- I couldn't understand how will they erase the first D-Mail using the IBN 5100. CONFUSING.
- And more importantly how did the first D-Mail managed to save Kurisu ? There was no action like in the other D-Mails, is was just Okabe informing Daru that he saw Kurisu dead... 
- The IBN 5100 ? Why is it so hard for SERN to find one ? Didn't they heard about Ebay ? PLOT HOLE
- The characters are able by a miracle to remember their past in the other line. If it wasn't for this it was really difficult or impossible to change the future. DEUS EX MACHINA.
- Taking in consideration how the time lines work, there was a way to save Mayuri without canceling the D-Mails... create another line, because Mayuri was destined to die in that line, as a result Okabe could had send another D-Mail, that would change the line. Taking in consideration the events, the best ideea would had been to send a simple D-Mail, in which he will say to ignore Moeka the first time he meet her... as a result even the IBN should remain in their possesion. PLOT HOLE
- Why did Mr Braun need expendable agents to find a PC ? Is not like is ilegal. DUMB PLOT HOLE 
- After he is hurt saving Kurisu when he returns together with Suzuha in the past she disappear because the future chages, but Okabe returns in his time, which means the time machine remains, doesen't it ? But if the future was changed the time machine wasn't invented, this is what we are made to belive by Suzuha herself too... If so, Okabe should had dissapeared too, as he represent a future without Kurisu. The fact that he returns in future and the fact that he is wounded even trought he represent his past self who wasn't hurt yet, is quite ilogic. As he saw his past self he shouldn't be part of that time line anymore, as the future was changed, the Okabe who saw Kurisu in the blood pool should take his place (even if his memory would remain intact), in conclussion Okabe should had dissapeared together with Suzuha and the time machine.CONFUSING PLOT HOLE
Those are the main flaws that really couldn't make me see this show as a masterpiece. I will probably play the game sometime in the future, even trough I am not a gamer (I still didnt finished Resident Evil 5, I had it for over 1 year, and i didn't finished first chapter yet).",8

                Time traveling fiction is always hard to pull off. When you deal with time travel in your novel/manga/book (or any other entertainment) there is always a huge risk of fail, because, well the obvious reason being humanity doesn't know, let's say a lot, about time travel and there are literally countless theories about impact on timeline from various actions.
When you take into account butterfly effect, paradoxes and possible break in space-time continuum you'll understand how hard it is to come up with, not even great, but decent story for time travel.
While some people watch such movies/anime etc. for shear entertainment purposes, others, like me for
                  instance, take into account all the problems that such narrative could cause from the logical point of view. When you see time traveler going back in time to prevent someone's death (i.e. The Time Machine movie) that was the motivating factor of creating the time machine, you see how paradoxical that decision is.
Story:
Steins;Gate deals with the aforementioned problems in an unique way. Coming up with the whole new theory of timeline, thus eliminating some paradoxes that could cause story breakdown. It is unique and fresh. That is why I have not found a single problem with the story. It is so good I can give it 10/10

Steins;Gate somewhat lacks in this aspect. While the art is not bad it is not exceptionally good. Art is pleasing to the eyes. Lack of effects on some aspects like blood, time travel etc. takes that 1 point from being perfect. Thus I give it 9/10
Sound:
For my personal taste op/end songs where not that great in this piece. BGM lacks some charm from time to time but is overall great. Seiyuu's worked hard to match the emotions of characters and the way they are portrayed is no less than perfect. 9/10
Character:
I don't have enough words to describe how great the characters are made. They all have their unique characteristics, charisma and you will love them from the start. Every single character, from Main to support characters are great and lovable thus I give 10/10
Enjoyment:
Oh... Here I could go on for days. I was on pins and needles the whole way through. Fun parts are hilarious, sad parts are, cry into pillow and hope to die, sad. I literally felt every emotion that anime was trying to show me. I laughed and cried with the characters. Their sadness was my sadness and that is rare, because I am not one to drop a tear easily, Otoko dakara! Definitely without any further discussion I give 10/10 for the enjoyment I received from this anime
Overall:
As I already said this type of story is hard to pull off, but Steins;Gate does it like if the mangaka experienced this story and just documented it. It is that good. More than lifelike. This anime makes you think, maybe the world line theory, that is portrayed in this anime, is a real theory and can exist?",10

                Overview:
Woah Nelly. I am at last compelled to submit a review, and for the exalted Steins;Gate no less. I want to do so not because I was blown away by an intricate plot or an exciting portrayal of abstract temporal science or an examination of time travel from ethical or emotional standpoints. I feel like doing so because Steins;Gate is the most overrated anime I‚Äôve encountered in some time. Which is not to say it‚Äôs unwatchable. However, I am disappointed, and I have my reasons. Let‚Äôs discuss. 
Characters:
My biggest issue with Steins;Gate is its cast of characters. The easiest route to see that a viewer
                  is invested is through emotion. This is especially true with a sci-fi story about time travel. They want to make you care about the characters. In that case they‚Äôre supposed to rope you in, make your stay enjoyable, and be your vehicle for caring about what happens next. Then that‚Äôs the ticket! Let‚Äôs experience a glimpse into the intriguing realm of time travel with a zany and eccentric mad scientist, his beautiful assistant and consummate foil, and his incorrigible lewd techie! Sign me up! 
But not really. Let me answer all that by informing you that this series took me several years to watch. There were times I thought I wouldn‚Äôt finish. You quickly find that, indeed, the characters are inextricable from the plot. This made it difficult for me to enjoy said plot when I didn‚Äôt like those characters.
The main cast of Steins;Gate is largely comprised of socially inept assholes. That‚Äôs a rocky start. I would like to review them to fully illustrate how damaging this is. 
Okabe: Our mad scientist and main protagonist. What a piece of work. He‚Äôs loud, insensitive, and his dramatic eloquence and strange behavior make his interactions with other characters cringe-worthy. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love a good cringe. But these were not good cringes. This guy makes putting one‚Äôs foot in their mouth an Olympic sport. It‚Äôs like life is a point-and-click adventure and he wants to click the worst option every time just to see the NPCs‚Äô reactions. Only they‚Äôre not NPCs. He just seems to treat people like his lackeys (much to Kurisu‚Äôs chagrin). 
Okabe insists on assuming and expressing a fantastic persona. He‚Äôs awkward. He exhibits inappropriate behavior, such as loud speech, insensitive rhetoric, disruptiveness, and frequent failure to face people he‚Äôs speaking to. He has trouble expressing his emotions and is oblivious to social cues and all but the most blatant emotional expressions of others. He‚Äôs fixated on his identity as a genius and leader of his home laboratory in the upper level of an electronics store. 
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but these characteristics and observable behaviors all point to a mild form of autism. 
Kurisu, a.k.a. Christina: Insufferable tsundere piece of trash. Utters such zingers as ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I care‚Äù while blushing and turning away, and ‚ÄúWere you worried about me?‚Äù Good lord. 
Hashida, a.k.a. ‚ÄúDaru‚Äù: Fat computer whiz and resident otaku who can‚Äôt keep his sexual fantasies to himself. Pretty one-dimensional. Good job, guys. 
Mayuri: Total sweetheart! The first character I really found myself caring about. Is always bright-eyed and encouraging and sensitive to others‚Äô feelings and struggles. She is not beyond chastising Okabe for his bullshit. But wait‚Ä¶what sorcery is this? I usually hate the happy-go-lucky nice girl character. Let‚Äôs continue. I‚Äôm suspicious.
Suzuha: The only other character I found likable. Why? She‚Äôs not particularly interesting. It could be that I like her because she‚Äôs not a jerk. In that case I‚Äôm lowering my standards as I watch this show. Yikes. 
Moeka: Oh god, let‚Äôs move onto something else.
Plot:
The plot itself begins modestly when Okabe and his lab crew discover that a microwave they‚Äôve modified can send text messages to the past. That sounds strange for such an acclaimed series, and may even be boring to some people. I think it‚Äôs a pretty cool idea. It‚Äôs so small, yet so huge. Imagine if that were discovered in real life (ignoring the fact that it would likely be abused to the detriment of mankind). 
That‚Äôs bonkers! Starting off with a tip-of-the-iceberg scientific concept like that is a good call. But they just bask in it. They let it sit out and get stale. The first ten episodes of the series are spent with the characters being introduced and playing with this ‚Äúphone wave.‚Äù Not only does the concept get dull, but couple that with how I view the characters, and it‚Äôs easy to understand why watching this series felt like a chore at first. 
When experimenting with this concept, the lab members garner attention from people they know. They allow them to participate in order to learn what effects emerge in the present. While that‚Äôs a sensible way for the plot to progress, by the same token, the way some of the scenarios played out are so conveniently self-contained that the changes are hard to believe. Or to care about for that matter. 
I believe that the writers try to address the rather slight nature of these changes by explaining it with the ‚Äúdivergence ratio.‚Äù This concept isn‚Äôt necessarily introduced for this purpose, but it‚Äôs probably the component that would explain it. Even then it doesn‚Äôt quite fit. After all, the writers did a half-hearted job of devising and explaining the workings of time and time travel in the Steins;Gate universe. 
The show‚Äôs concept of time travel operates on a model of linear time that can splinter off into divergent ‚Äúworld-lines‚Äù of varying degrees of deviation from their parent lines. If you were to try and explain the clean nature of the changes to the world line by attributing them to low divergence ratios ascribed to the changes, the highly contained results of the changes we see are dubious. There‚Äôs probability involved due to the sheer number of variables, and the entropy inherent in those variables. Therefore the chances of the observable changes being so well-contained in the story‚Äôs context are infinitesimal. 
This is my opinion though. These abstract concepts I‚Äôm criticizing simply may be how the writers wished to portray diverging timelines. And that would be just fine I guess, if a bit lazy. However, later events in the show adhere to the eternalist value that future events ‚Äúalready exist‚Äù and are ‚Äúbound to happen.‚Äù Yet this holds the universe of Steins;Gate to a model of time as a dimension that cannot be linear by nature. Still the characters insist on illustrating time with this model of linear world-lines, while believing that they can change the future by changing the past. So which is it?
None of this is to mention that the coverage of time travel in this show conveniently ignores key elements, such as ontological paradoxes, thermodynamics, the Grandfather paradox, and compossibility. The more I think about it, the more holes I find in the presentation. 
Whether or not you read that digression/mini-essay/rant about the implausibility of the show‚Äôs self-justifications, it all starts with the slog through the first 10 episodes and lasts to the end. The irritating sins of the first story arc culminate in a moment in which some sort of disaster caused two characters to fall into a position that can only be described as an attempt at ‚Äòcute fan-service‚Äô or romantic tension. They blush, their faces inches from each other‚Äôs. 
I looked up to the ceiling for a minute in despair. ‚ÄúSpare me‚Äù was all I could think. Why is this series regarded as such a masterpiece if this is what I get? I casually lost my will to keep watching. That ended up being a hiatus that lasted several years until I continued to the end a few days ago. I was told time and time again by fans that it ‚Äúgets good around episode 12.‚Äù
Look. If an anime is this highly rated, it should not take 11 episodes to ‚Äúget good.‚Äù It should already be good. It should offer a strong introduction that flows well into the rest of the series. Instead what I got from this is 10 episodes that suck outright. If this series is as amazing as everyone says, 40% of it shouldn‚Äôt suck. 
The series truly kicks off at episode 11. The plot at last moves along; things feel like they‚Äôre happening. These new developments present some substance and consequences. Nothing for ten episodes, then all this. It‚Äôs jarring stuff. 
The lab members work on the next step in their technological advancements. We finally see Okabe show emotions like a normal person would. We watch him work himself to the bone out of caring for another person. In the middle of the series, we see the sprouts of character development. Easy there, speed demon. Because the stakes are finally raising there‚Äôs a sense of puzzlement under pressure. Okabe has moments where he catches a glimpse of light - an idea he has to try because it might be the first step in solving a conundrum. These moments can be exciting. This could be where Steins;Gate shines.
The excitement quickly exhausts itself. For all the abrupt progress it made, the story devolves into an onslaught of weird dancing all around and back and forth with little to no real consequences. Now it feels like time travel is an excuse to do so, but what that accomplishes is the undoing of any sense of tragedy or danger. It undermines any previous or impending consequences. It even ads an element of, dare I say, predictability (gasp!). Last time I checked, predictability is not something you want in a thriller. 
This plot could have turned out great and it didn‚Äôt. I say that because I can tell the writers tried really hard. But I don‚Äôt give A‚Äôs for effort. 
Now for some technical aspects of the show before I share my final thoughts. 
Sound: I am conflicted on the sound. On one hand, the voice talent is fantastic. It‚Äôs one of this show‚Äôs strong suits. There are no points where a flat delivery or overacting ‚Äútook me out of it.‚Äù What does take me out of it, on the other hand, is the music. It‚Äôs poor for the most part. As I recall it‚Äôs sparse. When it is present it‚Äôs noticeable in a bad way. 
There is one distinct moment I remember where two characters are having a serious discussion about what‚Äôs going on around them. They‚Äôre getting emotional. Someone‚Äôs voice is wavering. But in the background is this cheesy piano song that does nothing but damage the impact of the scene. Music is supposed to ad atmosphere, but in this case the composition is ill-fitting. It may not even be a real piano. Maybe it is a real piano and that‚Äôs the fault of the recording engineer? Who knows? Shortly afterwards, badly synthesized violins join the arrangement. The whole thing is just unfortunate. 
The opening song is good from what I remember, but nothing that stuck with me because they only show it a few times. I like one original song. It‚Äôs a dark and ominous orchestral piece that played during a preview of the next episode. I only remember that brief clip, though. 
Animation: The animation is strong. The opening sequence is impressive in its design and effects. It‚Äôs a shame we only see it a handful of times. The art style is sharp, although the character designs left much to be desired. There are times when you see awkward facial shapes (colloquially known as QUALITY), but these are few and far between. 
The cinematography ads to the experience. There are plenty of times where scenes are made more dramatic or interesting by frame composition. The camera will focus on a broken pocket-watch, a cicada, a police siren, etc. There are sequences such as one in which two characters scramble inside to get out of the rain; you see it as if you are perched in a hole in the roof, watching through rubble and steel beams as they run past. Very cool. 
Conclusion: Not a masterpiece. Far from it. What could be an interesting plot and a somewhat refreshing portrayal of time travel is bogged down by a weak cast of characters, wonky pacing, overblown storyboard, farcical logic, and gratuitous romantic subplots. The ‚Äòshenanigans‚Äô between these characters are not ‚Äòfunny‚Äô or ‚Äòentertaining‚Äô. I rolled my eyes every ten seconds. You can‚Äôt begin the show as a character-driven machine, then turn up the heat on the plot when I‚Äôm bored and surrounded by douchebags and expect me to like that. And you certainly can‚Äôt call that masterpiece material. Ya just can‚Äôt. 
I don‚Äôt absolutely hate Steins;Gate. It has some redeeming qualities. Hell, for all the griping I‚Äôve done, I gave the show a 6 out of 10. That‚Äôs mostly because of the plot in the two later arcs. The plot can be enjoyable at times, if still choppy and guilty of deus ex machina. That‚Äôs Steins;Gate at its best. At its worst, it feels like The Big Bang Theory meets The Notebook. That‚Äôs incredibly frustrating. 
I will admit that Steins;Gate is objectively above average. By the same token, it‚Äôs objectively not the masterpiece that fans make it out to be. 
Thank you very much for reading my review. I didn‚Äôt want it to be this crazy long. Sorry about that.",6
"
                Time travel is one of the most appealing concepts in Science Fiction. It is also one of the most demanding and hardest to implement when it come to making a logical and consistent story, and this is where i think Steins Gate comes short.
Story and Characters >
 - What I liked : We follow the progression of some geeks trying to make a time machine for fun until they realize that jumping in time can have disastrous chain reactions. Okame's passionate and excessive character contrasts with all the others. The characters get to discover the adverse effects of time travel. They are tormented and thrown
                  into difficult situations where they have to make important choices. 
   The plot offered some complex elements and twists that kept my attention level while watching the second half of the series.
   The ending answers most of the interrogations satisfyingly.
- What i disliked : The first half of the series is very slow paced and the characters are presented as elements of stereotypical harem setting (the tsundere type, the childhood friend, the shy clumsy one, the cool quiet one with glasses etc..) witch made it difficult for me to connect or care about them.
   Decisions about changing the course of History are motivated by emotions rather than the common sense that these difficult situations would require. This impacts the credibility and coherence of the plot.
   The progression in the second half is mostly predictable.
Animation is good for a TV series and get fluid in the important part of the story. Storyboard and directing were interesting in distilling suspense.
Character Designs are unique to each protagonist and match their personalities. Detailed Background Art is limited to parts of Akihabara streets and the Club room. 
The music is discrete and not too memorable. I loved the voice acting work for the main character. It was successful in depicting his insane energy and then his fears when everything goes wrong.
In Conclusion, watching the first half of the series was very hard for me, but after giving up my expectations of a true plot-driven SF, the experience was rewarding at the end and i enjoyed it as a good pop-corn show.",6

                Wow, it's a shame I didn't watch such a masterpiece until now. Steins; Gate, a show truly deserving of its ranking on this site.
Story: 10/10
When I first read the synopsis, I was pretty hesitant about starting it. Time travel? It's an easy topic to mess up; it's either too confusing to follow or the sci-fi is too absurd to be taken seriously. But Steins; Gate found a niche in between, creating a story which was full of well-timed suspense and a clear direction of where it was going. 
Admittedly, it starts off a little slow, but I urge you not to drop it and push
                  through, because this show's greatest strength is its timing. Unlike many shows which reveal the plot twist in one instant, Steins; Gate reveals details over time, just enough so you're not sure what the ending will be, but will stay interested and not be overwhelmed in one single episode. This means Steins; Gate also avoids the unfortunate mistake of many 20+ episode shows where the ending is rushed and leaves the viewer feeling unsatisfied. 
Art: 10/10
A rating of 10 doesn't mean it's something like Kotonoha no Niwa, but the artistic style was perfect for this kind of show. The colors are sort of grayish and dull, but it's suited for the solemn moments in the show.
Sound: 10/10
Solid opening and endings, and there was a surprising number of different themes used throughout the show, not just one recycled tune.
Characters: 9/10
Steins; Gate does a fantastic job of creating characters which seem to fit anime tropes, but don't really. Makise Kurisu is well-known for being a tsundere, but it somehow works even though Steins; Gate isn't a pure romance. The tsundere part of her is not overdone nor is it annoying; it's just enough to make her a believable character. 
The main character, Okabe Rintarou, is something of everything. He'll make you laugh from his cringe-worthy dramatizations, gasp from his near-death experiences, cry from his heartbreaks, and cheer for his charismatic victories. Truly a unique and one-of-a-kind character.
The other characters are all developed equally well, each playing an important role in the story, each with their own motive for their actions. 
By not adopting clear-cut arcs, Steins; Gate allows each character to stay relevant until the end, giving more depth and realism to their personalities.
Enjoyment: 9/10
Truly a rollercoaster ride of emotions. The comedy is hysterical, the action is adrenaline-inducing, the sadness is heart-wrenching, and the ending was a nice finish to the journey. It is one of the few shows I've seen that is able to be a bit of every genre without forgetting its identity as a mystery and sci-fi thriller.
Overall: 10/10
Just a fantastic show. Even if you're not really into mystery thrillers, I beg you to try Steins; Gate and not drop it after the first four episodes. You will be rewarded with a fantastic experience :)
Thanks for reading this review; feel free to give me a Helpful. If it wasn't, I'm totally open to constructive criticism as I'm always trying to improve my writing!",10
"
                When I normally rate anime, to be honest, a 10 is an average score. Usually it's due to the fact that I'm poor at being critical towards any anime for whatever reason meaning my usual ""10"" is usually probably unjustified. However, when rating Steins;Gate, I'm actually able to fully justify my rating of 10 without being speechless when asked to give reasons as to why I rated another show 10 (unless its Angel Beats)! 
Steins;Gate will probably make you laugh, cry, cringe and even the occasional loss of self belief.  
NOTE - This review is based on the DUB of Steins;Gate.
Story - 10/10:
I won't
                  bother explaining the plot as that is what a synopsis is for but what I will say is that this is a new story type for me. I've never seen a time travel anime before so my expectations for what sort of plot the creators could conjure up didn't really spring to mind. However, what Steins;Gate does well in the story department is how the anime doesn't ""forget"" certain memorable, or sometimes miniature, moments and brings back past actions of the characters which will instantly spring to your mind. You may forget what happened the past 10 episodes, but you will most likely be reminded of it when plot point occurs. That's what's so great about the story of Steins;Gate; it doesn't forget previous episodes mini story lines and intertwines each line in one way or another. 
I tried my best to find any plot holes in an anime that was vulnerable to them, hence having time travel in any kind of show can be dangerous in terms of plot holes emerging, but I didn't find any. Yes, I may have and probably did miss some points where there was some plot holes but, from my experience of watching it, nothing appeared abnormal.
The ending was very satisfying. I would say more but due to rules and regulations in place, all I can say is that the ending will most likely satisfy your needs.
Sound - 10/10:
Let's talk about the opening and ending music first. Firstly, the opening of Steins;Gate was simply outstanding in terms of sound. It's the definition of beautiful. It had a constant tense yet relax feeling to it, which was mainly what the anime had; extremely intense in places yet while also being comedic in other sections. 
The ending was my favourite soundtrack in the entire anime, in my opinion. It was a great ending track due to the fact that almost every episode ended either dramatically or, with lack of better terms, left it on mini cliffhangers. The song prepared you for the upcoming episode and left you wondering what the recent events mean because of how the song built up from calm to intense and almost nerve wrecking. 
Tracks played in the background of the anime usually always fit. Although many are admittedly forgettable, most of the tracks fit the situation even if some of the tracks are rehashed in sections of the anime. 
Onto voice acting and here is where I have differing opinions. This is the first time in my whole anime viewing when I actually watched the dub FIRST (usually I watch the dub second if at all). I have to say that I'm happier with how most of the characters are portrayed with their voices in the dub, rather than the sub, for the main reason that it seems as though each character, in my opinion, is presented as being more fitting to the role. Each character in the dub has the right commitment in terms of voice; they're either as enthusiastic as they need to be, as serious as they need to be, as sad as they need to be and so on and so fourth. My personal recommendation is the dub, but the sub is also amazing (I just prefer the dub, the first anime so far that I will say that).
Art - 10/10:
Although not the overall aspect of the series, the art style of Steins;Gate is interesting. The style can be seen as realistic while also being deformed (in a good way), especially if you pay close attention to even the opening background. It's got a very memorable style of art, not unique, but it's still executed almost flawlessly. With the story in mind, the art style does suit it. I say that because the art seems to present itself as detailed while also being subtle (in some parts of the anime). This is related to the story because we often see the characters experience traumatic or intense moments which requires detail, but other parts of the anime have just a singular character being portrayed with a certain colour background (one springs to mind instantly but I'm not allowed to say it due to possible spoilers). Nothing in the art ever bothered me or hurt my eyes to look at. Everything was watch-able without any issues for me. 
Character - 10/10:
I'll try my best not the spoil anything in this section so I'll keep this part short. One word describes each character: depth. When I say ever, I mean, EVERY main and most support characters have their personalities, back stories and anything else you can think of covered. As I just said, it wasn't just the main characters that were developed. All the characters reacted in realistic ways ACCORDING to their personality. Yes, some actions of characters were absurd and ""not normal"", but these were because of personality traits in these characters making them REALISTIC reactions/actions. 
Overall - 10/10:
I won't bother having an enjoyment section as I feel as though I added parts of that in each section of this review. I don't want to seem like a blind fan boy of the show, as this isn't even my favourite anime. I recognise that there are flaws such as sometimes the soundtracks in the background are sometimes forgettable and that the actual genre/story type may not suit some people due to the nature of Sci-Fi, but Steins;Gate has something for everybody. If you didn't enjoy Steins;Gate for whatever reason, if you've seen it, then I can understand why, but the positives, in my opinion, outweigh the negatives in such a way that, until now, I never even noticed any negatives (and they are minor).",10
"
                I had mixed feelings for Steins;Gate until the very end, but was glad I listen to it. Here's my review.
Okabe is probably the most endearing megalomaniac you'll ever seen! This series follows his group of friends as they make a machine that can send text messages to the past, using a microwave and whatnots.
The story takes a deadly turn as they realize how much power their gadget holds.
CHARACTERS
I'm not gonna lie, I almost dropped this anime because of the characters. To make it simple, the only girl in this series who isn't in love with the main character is the landlord's 7-years-old daughter. I have
                  a very short temper for stereotypical portrayal of women in anime, and this female cast is probably the worst kind of submissive/naive/insecure/kawaii/you-name-it. 
That being said, I found out that Steins;Gate is an adaptation from a dating sim game. Which explained everything.
The girl characters are all filling a stereotype. You have the ""cute"" childhood friend who speaks of herself in the third person and isn't smart enough to understand what's going on, but will cheer for her buddy anyway.
You have the very shy temple girl, who is actually a guy. The opportunity to write a decent transexual character was lost to make him a comic relief of some sort.
Next is the shut-in who somehow spends her whole time outside. As a result, she uses her cellphone to text other characters instead of speaking with them.
The local maids cafe's star, who ends all of her sentences with 'nyan'.
There is also the clerk who works at the electronic store just below the gang's appartment. She is optimistic and easygoing, but has a dark past of some sort...
And the genious scientist who wrote a paper on time travel, but is a severe tsundere who cannot seem to deal with her emotions.
As for boys, Okabe, the main character, is of course handsome and insane. He is conviced a mysterious 'Organization' is out there to steal his inventions and make his plans fail. His accolyt, Daru, is an oversized hacker otaku with a perversed mind. Because of course, nobody can be given a shot at attracting girls except for the (player's) character! 
But I watched the anime even though I had doubts, and I'm glad I did.
STORY
The first half of the story is very slice-of-lifey. It has a slow pace and hints just enough mystery here and there to let you know that something bigger is scheming. It can be long to watch, especially as the characters aren't the most interesting bunch to follow, but there is a genuine feeling of serenity and happiness throughout the show.
The second half revolves around time-travelling. It is well-paced and really makes up for the slow start of the series. The theories it presents are interesting, but the resolution to most of the problems Okabe encounter feel way to easy and lighthearted. It's as if the characters take decisions because it will resolve things faster, and not because they want to do it that way. It feels a little cheap at time. Not to mention cheesy.
Overall, Steins;Gate is still enjoyable. It has cute moments and an interesting concept, as well as a solid main character. But seeing the potential it has, handled better, this could have been a kick-ass show, instead of the okay anime it is.",6
"
                I first picked up this series because it was labeled as seinen, which is what I normally watch. I got through the first episode and tossed it aside for a while since I didn't find anything special about it. When I picked it back up however my mind had changed. This series may start off a little slow, but aside from that it is damn near perfect. There is a distinct moment that occurs about a quarter through the series that anyone who has watched it will remember well. Once this point is reached it is hard to stop watching. Steins;Gate does a really good
                  job when it comes to a time travel story and watching how earlier action affected the future was satisfying. The voice actors did a fantastic job, and the only character I didn't find myself liking was Moeka, an almost exclusively silent character. Also, the ""rosebud"" style ending was phenomenal.",10
"
                (7.0/10)
In an undeniable sense, time feels like something you only think about when its pertinent. It's never on your mind until it is. Much like when someone mentions blinking, swallowing, breathing, you don't notice you do it until it's brought up. When it is brought up, however, you can't stop noticing. 
Gulp. I close my eyes. I exhale. 
There's no antiquated view on time because of this. It's always static. If you miss a meeting, you didn't think about it. When the existential nature of time gets brought up there's no doubt that you'll be thinking about every second you spend. How it's something you
                  can't change. The past is the past, the future is the future. You know the past, you don't know the future. And so time goes on in a finite sense. 
And yet, Mayushi's watch has stopped, the hourglass stops pouring, and time is no more. So if you could change time, how would you? 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Enter Steins;Gate. A flawed series that always tries to put its best foot forward in pretty much every way. I felt a constant sense of pride from the writers room or from the directorial staff while watching this show. That's a good thing. There's something nice to see a piece of work someone is proud of, even if that work has fundamental flaws that you can't overlook. 
A show about a scientist named Okabe Rintarou as he discovers a time machine with his friends, the portly nerd, Daru, the slow, yet adorable Mayuri, and the female counterpart and love interest, Kirisu. 
Through this short yet sweet journey they meet plenty of reoccurring characters and players that have a fundamental, yet somewhat sloppy, effect on the story. 
...
As I said, while the show has fundamental power in its storytelling ability, it still finds itself tripping itself to the conclusion. However, some sloppy character decisions as well as iffy plotholes and atrocious sound-design don't end up detracting as much from the experience as I may have expected.
I'll be separating this review into a few simple sections that will define my thoughts on the characters, the story, the sound design, and the art. 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
[Artistry, Aptitude, and the Pretty Picture]
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
[ART]
...
The first thing you will notice, I think, in this show is the solid art. This ranges from the character design to the scenery to the animation. Everything here seems like it fits. 
Studio White Fox, while not a studio I've seen much of, immediately interested me with a lot of design choices. Firstly, and perhaps the most obvious, is filtering the show to be completely washed out. Thematically and visually. 
If you don't catch my drift, I'll explain. To wash something out means to de-saturate a lot of the color from the image, making the scenery seem faded and exhausted. Much like a rock that's been living at the bed of a river basin. 
While i'm usually the type to like more colorful scenery; I found myself pretty invested in the design. It was purposefully created like this, but more importantly it ""fit"" the story that was going to be told. The reds are powerful, but the filter is cool. A lot of very cold colors are used, light blues and whites, to paint a seemingly bleak picture. A world that may in fact be under a threat, a world that isn't fully in the picture. It's a picture that brightens up as you enter Okabe's lab, which is actually just his little rented place above a TV-store. You see that he's fully encompassed in whatever work he has, creating wacky experiments with his friends and thinking of all sorts of crazy conspiracy theories that makes him an eccentric personality on screen. 
...
[ANIMATION]
...
The positives continue with the animation, which is wholly solid throughout. The only dip in quality I saw was one episode early on in the series. White Fox works well in very subtle facial expressions, which are pretty rare to find in anime since the character designs are generally hard to animate as they are. 
While I wouldn't say Steins;Gate does facial animation like Monogatari, per say, but it still does a very solid job of conveying emotion that isn't just the voice actor quietly grunting into their microphones. 
Subtle isn't the only thing White Fox excels at too, there are multiple scenes where the emotions that are being felt are very 'big', so the reactions need to be big. Particularly our protagonist, Okabe, is given some really awesome animation that show his pain in these scenes. 
Continue this winning streak with winning shading and thoughtfully placed art-direction. While I wouldn't call the directing in the series ""exceptional"", I would say that the director does do an above-average job of framing the scenes in ways that either conceal, or reveal, certain aspects about each character.
...
[CHARACTER DESIGN]
...
The character designs are similarly well-done. Even the protagonist is given a sense of nuance to his design, which is the biggest compliment I can give the design team. So often we get anime protagonists that look like the most generic, self-insert bullshit. It's so refreshing to see a design that is given at least a modicum of effort put into its originality. 
Our lab coat donning protagonist sports thin stubble and a lanky, tall nature. It reflects his personality well. He's a design that I feel should be the gold standard for anime MC's. 
This matched with multiple standout backing characters creates for a very colorful (ironically) cast of characters. I've always said that an anime that wants an air of realism about it by not coloring every other character's hair with a shade of the rainbow is an anime I respect. 
Mayuri, the show's stand out character (more on her later), is an incredibly soft-looking girl. She wears a very wavey dress and floppy little hat, all colored in a cool blue. An outfit speaks a thousand words on the characters personality, especially in a show that wants to keep character's dressed the same way every episode. So we see her optimistic, cute nature shine through constantly in her design. The wavy nature of her dress reflects her wavy persona. She's a little simple, but that's what makes her so charming. 
With Daru we have a bit more of a generic ""nerd"" character design, but his massive lumbering nature hides a very gentle and loving guy. 
Kirisu is the shows tsundere so she gets vibrant red hair that juxtaposes the shows cool nature. While I have issues with her as a character, her design is very good. I don't know why she wears her jacket like that, though. 
...
Lastly, we have the shows background characters which are all equally well-made apart from maybe Faris, a father complex having fake cat girl that honestly never really felt like a part of the show. She works at the maid cafe which has her in skimpy outfits as well as meowing constantly.
Ruka, an androgynous boy which at first felt like a joke-character actually has a very charming and cute design that i'm sure a lot of people really liked. He's utilized more for story than I would expect, especially since certain choices he makes play a vital role in certain story outcomes. I appreciated the writers taking the time to make an undoubtedly fanservice-bound character interesting enough to include in the base story.  
Moeka and Suzaha are also two of the shows recurring characters that sport similarly realistic character designs. One with long pigtails and the other with flowing locks. Once again, the show knows design.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
[SOUND]
I'll keep this mercifully short. With as much praise as I can give to the art team, I honestly don't know what happened with the sound designers. I feel like they completely dropped the ball on this one. 
This is so disappointing because I don't think people understand how important sound is to film and television. Sound is something that can make or break the shows most important scenes. Whether its background music that fills your heart with joy, or the pitter-pattering of rain on the rooftops. Sound is there to make you unconsciously (or consciously) feel. 
...
[MUSIC]
....
Now the music isn't bad.  Apart from the good ending track, nothing really stands out but not everything can be a win. There are constant melodic flairs that back scenes, but thankfully, there were times where the show felt reserved with its background music. Especially during its first few episodes where certain comedic scenes could've been ruined by a generic bouncy background track. 
The opening is alright.
...
[SOUND DESIGN]
...
Yeah... here's where the score comes in. I have no idea what the fuck this was. 
The sound design felt so out of place sometimes that I felt like I was watching some sort of reconstruction of a corrupted file. Like someone found the a 'lost' show in some empty desk in his work building and decided to watch it. The voice acting was there and so were some atmospheric cicadas and footstep sounds... but every action scene lacked sound effects for whatever reason. 
So  this person decides to download the cheapest effects program and just dub it over. And man is it bad. I found myself constantly being chucked out of scenes like an unwanted whore from a nightclub. Every punch and consequent impact felt ridiculous and comical. 
Every 'boop' and 'beep' on electrical devices felt lame and cliche. Every shot from a pistol was weak and tame. Things like external environments were completely overlooked. Which is strange since certain aspects like birds chirping, footsteps, doors, and voices were of good quality. 
In one of the shows earliest scenes a character speaks into a microphone and instead of adding proper sounds, the sound designers just double her voice and add some grain effects. It was laughable and amateur for a production was decidedly NOT that. 
Very disappointing.

[STORY]
...
The story is yet another strong aspect of the show. Honestly, the story may be the strongest aspect of the show, which is something that i've never said about an anime series. Ever. 
Especially in the build up to the shows first story climax we get some properly intriguing mystery that isn't too obvious or hammy. Much like the bleak filter over the shows scenery, we get a potentially bleak story about the consequences of time. 
While the show does find itself stumbling towards its conclusion with a few plotholes and logical leaps that felt unearned, I found myself interested and engaged in the story. Perhaps because it was surrounded around my favorite character in the show... but more on characters later. 
There are a few areas where exposition gets heavy, but the exposition is usually done a pretty charming way. For example, if our protagonist wants to say what he's thinking so the viewers get it, instead of simply monologuing he speaks into his cellphone. This is played as humorous, since he's not actually speaking to anyone. In fact, he pretends as if he's talking to secret ""informants"" about a secret evil organization (called Organization). It's such a pretty way to do exposition that I wasn't angry there was a decent chunk of it. However, it's not always this perfect and easy to swallow. 
...
The story surrounding the characters was also on the weaker side. Every backstory felt pretty phoned-in and generic. Classic family issues mixed with more family issues with a nice seasoning of family melodrama. What was specifically unfortunate was seeing a character like Mayuri's potentially awesome backstory being explained in a pretty ""meh"" way. 
The surrounding story, however, is helped by some good comedy. If you know me at all then you know that's huge praise for an anime. Good comedy is something very rare in comedy and Steins;Gate has multiple times where I properly laughed out loud. That's awesome! By cutting out a lot of the generic background music that accompanies most anime comedy scenes, it creates this natural dynamic between characters that was honestly a pleasure to watch. 
...
But, thankfully, the base story is still strong. It runs through a few tropes, but each one is thankfully a trope I find myself enjoying when done well. There are time loops and various other time-related tropes that a lot of television and film cycle through. The show does them well. Every twist and turn that it takes is generally played well, with a few twists being particularly interesting. Certain character connections are drawn that are honestly very memorable and fun. 
As I said, it does stumble a little towards the end as the climax really felt forced and hammy. I think i'm being very lenient on the grade, both overall and just for the story. Perhaps it's because the show really doesn't try and over-explain things which I found refreshing for anime. 
Most anime goes into these long drawn out discussions about how something works. While this may very well be something helpful, factually, its not really entertaining and it bogs the story down with unneeded information. The show keeps things brisk and finds itself darting from idea to idea, creating for a frantic pace throughout most of its run-time.

[CHARACTERS]
...
Oh boy. Here we go. 
So, what makes a good character? I asked this question in one of my first reviews on this website. I struggled with this notion when I was reviewing Bakemonogatari as it presented these very memorable yet seemingly shallow (at the time) characters. It made me question the very nature of whether a character needs to be well-written to be ""good"". Or even written at all. 
While Monogatari posed those questions bravely. Steins;Gate sort of limps its way through the ""look, we developed characters"" finish line by the end of the series. 
...
So lets talk about what makes a good character in the most blatant sense. Avoiding memorable character designs and the crazy nuances that made me question my very existence a few months ago. 
A good character is fundamentally something you can feel something towards. Whether that feeling is love, attraction, or hatred. A well-written character is a tool to bring catharsis, at its very core. 
So, put bluntly, television anime generally fails at creating well-written characters. I know that's a broad and all-encompassing statement to make, especially since there are series anime out there that do in fact have well-written characters. 
Unfortunately, these intriguing and well-fleshed out characters are drowned under the the tidal wave of sexist figurine-bait and self-insert bullshit that plagues the Japanese animated television medium as a whole. 
...
For some reason, so many writers think that a good character means a character with quirks. Honestly, I doubt they even think they are good characters. Perhaps they think that they can fool viewers into thinking a character is good by giving them quirks.
I want to clarify, quirks and traits are two different things. A quirk, at its core, is a odd behavior that distinguishes one character from the next in a very obvious way. For example, a character that has a nervous tick and a character that has a foot fetish. 
While a trait is something more full. It's  something that's attached to that character. It's a part of them. It's something that lets you into their personality and lets you know who they are. 
That's the issue with so many anime characters. They lack traits and simply have quirks. 
...
Even Okabe, our ""mad scientist"", is simply a bunch of eccentric quirks. Without his love for Dr.Pepper, his loud laugh, and his mad-scientist shtick he'd just be another generic anime MC that can be defined as a ""nice guy"". 
That's a huge problem. Especially since early on in the show they try to establish him as a literal mad scientist. This could've easily been played as a joke where he simply calls himself that. However, every character, even the more serious ones like Kirisu actually react as if he is one. There are lines like, ""Wow, I didn't know you could be a nice guy"", when he acts 'nice'. 
Which feel so out of place since he never really goes into the realm of being an actual mad scientist. In fact, he sits comfortably between ""curious guy"" and ""slightly more curious guy"". He discovers a time machine and uses it. Then he messes up and promptly wants to fix what he fucked up.
IN WHAT WORLD IS THIS MAD?! A real mad scientist is one that is in the moral grey. Someone who sacrifices his loved ones for the sake of discovery. Someone who is constantly striving for knowledge and discovery. We don't really get this from Okabe. He's just kind of a zany dude who's curious about a time machine he found. He's actually pretty reasonable and safe most of the time...
...
Similar complaints can be lodged against Kirisu, who is a fan favorite in the show. Going into this I was well-aware a lot of people love her and by the end I just couldn't see why. She plays like every god damn tsundere i've ever seen. 
There is no trope she subverted as a tsundere. Her role is literally just to be smart on occasion and then blush and yell at our protagonist for being a pervert, even though he never really is a pervert. Like, yeah, he does three really really weird things in this show that are border-line rape-ish, yet those three things are never really brought up again and instead he gets called a pervert for like... accidentally glancing at a girl's bra. 
Come on. 
So here's Kirisu, a well-designed tsundere with daddy issues (cause of-fucking-course) who utters some of the shows most corny lines. Get this, in a scene where she beats our protagonist in a board game and he yells at her, she breaks down crying and says something along the lines of ""I'm not crying because a big scary man just yelled at me or anything."" 
""Big scary man""? Seriously, show? Jesus Christ... 
There's still haze of stale anime meta that just hovers over her like a storm cloud. Sure, sure, keep having the characters call her tsundere, that'll definitely make it less painful that she's just playing every trope you say you are being self-aware about. Just because you say you are doing something and still do it, doesn't make it any better. In fact, it makes it worse. The fact that you are aware you are doing this annoying fanservice-baiting trope and still continue to do it with no subversion makes you a dick. Writers, stop being dicks. 
Kirisu eventually begins to help Okabe with his endeavours but ends up just being another object in need of saving by the end, which is so disappointing since anime has a bad history of making every female character either an object of affection or an object to humiliate or an object to save. 
Regardless, they still just objects. I know I sound like a ranting third-wave feminist on the brink of writing a PC, yet angrily worded letter on my Tumblr account where I describe myself in fourteen different, yet equally retarded sounding genders. 
Trust me, its not like that. 
...
A character is only as good as the character that they play off of. If an entire gender is marginalized by making them simple cute figurine bait, then unfortunately the other gender tends to suffer since they're kind of left alone. But i'm not saying male characters are any better than female in most anime. They're just a different kind of bad. More self-insert less blatant sexism and objectification. 
It's just sad seeing potentially intriguing characters go to waste.
...
DO NOT GET ME WRONG, though. This show isn't really like that. There are relatively strong female characters in places... by places I mean one place. And by characters I mean one. But regardless, that's more than okay for an anime. 
Kirisu was generally just not that interesting. Especially since character dynamics in this show were interesting. As i've said, the comedy is good and often came from these character dynamics. So it's all the more glaring that Kirisu never really had an interesting character dynamic with anyone.
Even Okabe, the one character she finds herself talking with a lot of time wasn't really an interesting dynamic. Just a generic tsundere back and forth with obvious love-interest implications. It really wasn't anything to write home about, and that's sad seeing as it does take up a lot of screentime. 
By the end of the series I never felt like I knew Kirisu at all, if i'm honest. With well-placed quirks AND traits, a writer can create a character that you feel like you know. While Okabe was a protagonist with lots of quirks, I never really got to know him. Kirisu even more so. She lacked many quirks and was generally just there for exposition, blushing, angry yelling, emotional exposition about her family issues, love interest, and helping our protagonist when necessary. 
People will bring up that her ""personality"" was that of snarky smart-girl, but I never really got that. Every snarky remark never really hit home for me and always felt flat. These pieces of dialogue come so synonymous with the tsundere trope that I never really felt surprised or interested in anything she was saying. 
Apart from her occasional venture onto what I can only assume is a 4chan-esq message board and her love for science I can't really say I know anything about her. 
...
The same can be said about the other characters. The secondaries are honestly good though. It's alright that many of them don't really get fleshed out TOO much because that would just detract from the story and time-waste.
Apart from Faris, who honestly just bored me to death, most of the secondaries worked well! Ruka, the androgynous boy, was just an engaging presence to have and played a role in an compelling dynamic with Okabe. 
Moeka filled the role of deadpan shy girl. She gets some development in the series which worked well enough. She plays a big role in the series which further backs up most of her quirks. Once again, though, these feel mostly like quirks. Her shyness was never really explained, which makes it just feel like a tool to make her a character viewers end up liking. 
The Part-time warrior Sazuha is just a pleasure to have on screen. She's very energetic and plays up most of the character interactions. I really thought her story was well-placed and themed in the show. 
Daru, while shown as if he's one of the bigger roles, never really gets to break out from his defined quirks as well. He's still nice to have around and serves as a pretty funny joke-machine at times. 
...
And so I can finally talk about my angel in bright blue. Finally, I can describe to you why the character score doesn't lay at a ""mediocre"" 5/10, but instead at an ""above average"" 6/10! Finally I can explain the exact difference between a character, and well-written character. 
Mayuri. A character that i'm honestly surprised doesn't have a bigger fanbase since she pretty much inhabits every trait that i'd expect from a popular anime girl. She's very cute, reliable, and eccentric with a heart of gold. 
But more importantly, she's actually a character. Rather than just having a set of quirks that help distinguish her from the others, she plays more like a person. Albeit... a very odd person. 
Mayuri is a really lovable character because by nature she's very floaty. We've seen characters similar to this before. The light-hearted doofus with the heart of gold.
But instead of playing her simpleness for humor, the show tries to play it for personality. It actually succeeds, too. It's easier to make a character that isn't so out-there feel more like a person, which is why its so surprising to me that the one character the show really nailed was Mayuri, since technically she should be harder to write realistically. 
Her ""simpleness"" plays as a part of her backstory, as well as relates to every hobby and quirk she has. So for all of you not keeping track, she actually has a trait. This trait plays a role in her interests, and in turn, I feel like I actually got to know who she was as a person rather than a storytelling device. 
I know her likes, dislikes, but more importantly, what makes her, her. Out of every character in the show, if i were to strip her quirks of referring to herself in the third person, collecting cute little toys, and cosplaying; I feel like i'd still have a character that doesn't play like a genre cliche. 
Yes! You nailed it, Steins;Gate. 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
[CONCLUSION]
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
So Steins;Gate is far from perfect. It has issues that stem from characterization to sound design to a great story that just falls a little bit short towards the end. But that doesn't mean it's anything below a good fucking show. 
I think that the reason I can write so much about this show is because it tries to do more. Yes, sure, Kirisu plays like every tsundere ever, but in other aspects the show does try to create engaging characters. Giving the MC an actual personality, even if it is filled with simple quirks, makes him an engaging character throughout the show. Which is more than I can say about most anime MC's. 
The art is also standout, with stellar animation from White Fox. The cool colors help the show's themes feel more realized. The facial expressions are well-done and the directing is solidly above-average throughout. 
The story is also a highlight, especially in the first half where the mystery truly is engaging. The twists and turns it takes are interesting and while a few scenes towards the later-half of the show do tend to be pretty corny, the emotional heart stays equally likable. 
...
Steins;Gate is a show that at least puts in the effort of seperating itself. By adding more to just about every facet of something, you are, by nature, making things more ripe for criticism. And so is the unfortunate cycle of good writing. 
If you want your characters to have layers upon layers, then get ready for each individual layer to be analyzed and maybe criticized. But if you just want to create yet another battle shounen that recycles every character from previous battle shounen over and over again, then you don't open much room to be criticize apart from simply lacking in characters, period. 
...
Steins;Gate can often feel like a little bit of a mixed bag, what with the horrendous sound design yet beautiful animation. It almost feels like certain things don't belong due to how they belong on completely different ends of a certain spectrum. The fanservice the show has is generally very minimal, but still detracts from the overall experience as it often feels like i'm watching a completely different show when it just becomes focused on some sort of sexuality. 
This shouldn't ward you away from watching it though. There's a certain sense of uniqueness to the show that many anime simply don't portray. I think that many of these characters will stay with me for years to come. 
...
Time is a funny thing. You spend hours spending your time with animated caricatures and you feel an attachment to them. You spend enough time with anyone and you can feel at least some sort of connection with them. So's time. It keeps moving and we move along with it. I know that sounds like existential garbage but I feel like it's pertinent existential garbage. 
You only think about it when it's brought up. You don't go every day worrying about how you're getting older, or how you may die in the blink of an eye. You don't think about blinking, breathing, or swallowing unless it's brought up. Much like the ideas that surround time. 
But as humanity we still try to spend our time well. Even just sitting around doing nothing, just thinking. You still are spending your time. Regardless of how many people say you are wasting your time doing ""nothing"", you still are doing something. Whether its self-reflection or simply relaxing and resting to gain strength for the next day. It's still time well-spent. 
So spend your time well. Open the Steins;Gate.",7
"
                First of all.....i say this has to be the most overrated anime i've watched;i tryied to be as open minded all the way to the end of the series.... and yes, i must say that the characters are the best part of the entire Series; and the Story resulted to me the most lacking.
I recognize that it needed some time to really introduce the characters; but the slow pacing resulted to me in a disconnection from the series... ; certain twist (which i will not mention) i saw coming almost from the beginning of the series; so i was not really surprised at any point
                  during 23 episodes, and when i say 23, it's because there is just 1 episode that i absolutely loved, and im not talking about the ending.",6
"
                General Overview: Steins;Gate is a anime that tells the story of a group of friends in Japan who creates a device that allows them to send text messages back in time. The contraption that allowed them to accomplish this feat was ingeniously named futuristic gadget #8 Phone Microwave which is literally a cellphone attached to microwave. As the story progresses, we see how these text messages (D-mails) sent back into time using this devices affects the future and the characters lives. Something that is definitely stressed in this show is the re-precautions of blindly affecting the past using this device.
Characters: This is probably Steins;Gates most
                  redeeming quality. The characters in this show are simply amazing. Weather you love or despise a certain character in the show, you will eventually care about them to some degree. This show gives us a rough stretch of a character in the beginning then develops their emotions, goals, and humanity through the obstacles the have to face from time travel.This is true for the 4 main characters and all of the supporting characters. No one feels like they are just ""filler characters"" or follow a specific character archetype. As a side note, some of the characters were so lovable in this anime that literally cried during a couple of the emotional scene with them; something i never done before over an anime character.
Art/Sound: The art definitely was great. It was clear and crisp during 90% of the scenes. There were a couple of lighting issues during some of the night/dark scenes but nothing to drastic. The use of facial expressions in this anime is another thing that they did well in this anime. Facial language and emotions were realistic and not cartoony. As for the sound, the OST was well composed. This is illuminated in the opening and ending scenes. BTW the opening has to be one of my favorites in a long time. The animation for the opening is amazing and the song is catchy. The song is also relevant to the shows plot. Usually anime openings are just amvs with songs that don't make sense behind it. The lyrics in this one however fits the anime perfectly. The dramatic scenes was also complemented well eerie and futuristic sounds.
Dub v Sub: I can honestly say that i enjoyed the dub more than i liked the sub. There is nothing wrong with the subs but i personally felt the dubbing was more robust. I felt this way since the vocabulary used in the dubbing was insanely sophisticated compared to the Japanese dub. The big words and the intrinsic language used by Kurisu and Hououin when they argued gave them more personality and showcased how smart they truly are. In addition, Itaru Hashida's English voice actor had the best English dubbing from the entire cast. He reminded me of an actual pervert computer nerd then a sluggish hippo in the Japanese dub. 
Overall: I loved this anime.The character development and the relationships the characters had in this anime left me vulnerable to many emotions throughout the anime. There was also a fair amount of shock value to occurs in this anime that made my jaw drop. It was a roller-coaster and i would recommend anyone to watch.  Score 9.0/10    (First Review :D)",9
"
                I found this show to be very repetitive and sometimes boring, some might say that the repetitiveness is part of the show but I honestly couldn't care less if it is or not because I was genuinely waiting for something to change throughout the majority of the season.
As someone who is new to anime and came across this because of all the positivity surrounding it I am severely disappointed with this show. I have to note that I did watch the English version on Netflix as I don't find enjoyment from watching in Japanese with English subtitles.
The voice acting was very sub par in my
                  opinion, some characters lacked life and emotion, however the main protagonist can be amusing and the voice actor conveys his emotions well.
Other characters can just be damn right annoying and are not voiced well at all.
The animation is also very sub par, visuals are very dull and the characters look a little strange and inhuman-like. The visuals don't effect the score at all, although they are lacklustre.
The main plot is interesting, time travel is a hard concept to pull off because of it being an unknown science and at first I was excited to see where they were going to go, but in the end I was left disappointed by just the lack of scope and ambition throughout the show, because at the end of the day you want to see new and exiting scenes in a animated show because you can just let your imagination run wild and do wonderful things that you couldn't necessarily do on a live action show. But this entire show could of been done without using animation and on a tight budget. The show is also just very strange, again I am not that familiar with anime but as a newcomer I was left asking myself...why? I don't think the vision the creators had truly reflected on the show because some things just seem off, pacing is very frantic and you would do well to keep track. This wasn't my first anime, my first anime was full metal alchemist brotherhood which I very much enjoyed throughout, I just feel that was a well put together show compared to this with no annoyances and it always kept you on your toes, I can't say the same for this show, I struggled to watch some of it because I didn't care much for what was happening, I felt dettacthed from the experience. They use the same boring plot device for various episodes and I was close to quitting the show it got that tedious. The show has a few moments where you go ""wow they went there"" which was a pleasant surprise but it eventually gets predictable and bland.
The show just wasn't for me, it was OK in the end. People new to anime me be in the same boat as me but those more experienced with anime may get more enjoyment out of it. Just very average in my opinion.",6
"
                Any story specifically about time travel usually doesn't work out well, due to it's complexity. The hardest thing about writing a good time travel story is defining the rules of the universe, explaining how time travel affects the universe, and what limits a time machine has. Steins;Gate is an exception to the ""time travel story doesn't work out"" logic. In Steins;Gate, all of the rules are well defined down to how many letters can be sent in an email to the past as well as the extent to which time travel (quantum leaping) is possible. Steins;Gate is not an anime for anyone. Those who don't
                  want to actually pay attention and think while watching the anime or can't understand scientific things about time realities/paradoxes, and see the darkness of reality, then this anime is not for you. With that said, this is an absolutely ingenious masterpiece that is a watching experience that nobody should miss out on, and I can almost guarantee nobody will ever regret watching.
It's clear that altering even the smallest detail from a past event could alter the future drastically, but how much damage could a simple text message do? Could it destroy the hopes and dreams of everyone you love? How far could you go to make things right again? 
The plot revolves around Okabe Rintarou, a self-proclaimed ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù who goes by the alias ‚ÄúHououin Kyouma‚Äù. Okabe runs a little club, ""Future Gadgets Lab"" that consists of his two friends, Super Hacka Hashida ‚ÄúDaru‚Äù Itaru and innocent, adorable yet annoying female member, Shiina Mayuri. The purpose of the club? Destroying the world‚Äôs power structure. One day at a science lecture that Okabe was attending, he witnesses the murder of a teenage scientific prodigy, Makise Kurisu. Okabe proceeds to flee the crime scene and use his phone to message Daru about what he saw, only to find himself suddenly in a world where the events didn't quite happen the way he recalled them. No one else had any memory of what had transpired, the message he sent had a timestamp five days into the past, and‚Ä¶ Kurisu happens to still be alive. Through a series of psychologically mind-blowing events, Okabe turns a microwave into a device that can send text messages to the past. As they perform different experiments, they attract an organization named SERN who has been doing their own research on time travel, and now ""Future Gadgets Lab"" has to find a way to avoid being captured by them. 
The anime certainly does start off slowly, causing lots of viewers to lose interest. But, I assure you that once episode 9 arrives, the show takes a huge turn for the better. The first half of the anime is where all the groundwork is laid out: The characters are introduced, the status quo is slowly established, the setting is clearly set and the notion of time travel is introduced. The beginning is also a bit confusing at first but things do start to get clearer as the anime progresses. It‚Äôs one of the wondrous aspects of the anime. It was indulgent in its theories and scientific backing around time travel that everything the anime presented felt legit. It played around different theories and demonstrated some of them very clearly. Some of them will confuse the heck out of you though, stuff like the Kerr Black Hole Theory, Butterfly Effect and Parallel world theories are explored by the anime. Towards the very end of the first half, into the 2nd half of the show is where the premise of the show was actually introduced: actual time-traveling. The characters explored the capabilities of their time machine, discovered its restrictions and functions and made some tests to see how effective it is. Everything was flowing organically at this point. Characters are introduced further and certain relationships are established. The first half ended with the introduction of the conflict of the show. Into the second half, the plot just got more complex and interesting. 
One of the intriguing aspects of the show is despite the slow paced feel it has, the many twists and surprises catch the viewers off guard. The endless possibilities behind time travel coupled by certain theories are put into practice. Those stuff like the Butterfly effect and Parallel world theories the first half played with was amazingly incorporated into the story. As the conflict was heading towards its resolution, certain things will deliver a strong punch as you progress to the anime. The effects of all the tests Okabe and his gang made are now coming back to bite them in the ass and now it's up to them to clean up the mess that they created. The specific details that went into each moment/action, eventually opens up the way for an ideal conclusion to Steins;Gate. The ending was simply stunning. I cried.
""Characters"" in Steins;Gate is on par with it's plot (10/10). Amazing. The characters themselves are incredibly interesting personalities; despite each having their personal idiosyncrasies, almost every one of them reveal hidden depths to their characters, and the viewer gets to learn about each of their background stories, which flesh out the character beyond their typical behavior and habits, and sometimes even sheds light on said behavior and habits in the first place. The relationship the characters establish gets stronger and further revelation of the character‚Äôs past is used to enhance the story. This simple time travel anime soon becomes so much more than that because of the powerful cast. Steins;Gate is exceptional in how it manages to maintain these relationships of trust between its characters, even when time loops sliding wipes the memories of all Okabe; an impressive deed indeed. the side characters had amazing purpose to the story. The side characters were developed in detail as well, and all of them played an important role in the plot. The transformation of all characters made the anime all that much more memorable. The comedy relief in the anime is decent as well; it prevented the anime from being too serious, which is always good. 
""The conflict between the will to deny horrible events and the will to proclaim them aloud is the central dialectic of psychological trauma.‚Äù - Judith Lewis Herman
Okabe Rintarou, the main protagonist of the series was quite interesting to watch throughout the anime, for his personality changes quite a lot after experiencing lots of misfortune. In the beginning of Steins;Gate, Okabe is a funny, enigmatic, childish mad scientist who wears a lab coat 24/7. He usually gives off the impression of being delusional and paranoid, engaging in strange mannerisms such as talking to himself on the phone and engaging in fits of maniacal laughter often, this is in fact a fa√ßade he wears in order to make life more interesting. Initially, he is portrayed as being rather arrogant, however, it is later suggested that this is due to Okabe's eccentricities and social awkwardness. Despite the aforementioned traits, he is actually a kind and caring individual. This is particularly evident towards the end of the anime and the visual novel, where he casts aside his peculiar fa√ßade, to save his friends from the seemingly unavoidable fate of the Alpha worldline. But his initial behaviors and personality all change. Going back in time in order to undo a horrifying event, that perhaps cannot be changed. What does that mean? Does something called unchangeable fate and destiny exist? The once pure Okabe has to witness the death of Mayuri and Makise multiple times, leaving him unforgettable scars, and pain, causing him to completely change. It almost seemed like a coming of age story with time travel that included dark truths about reality for an adult. 
The art in Steins;Gate isn't amazing, but it's decent. The character designs were pretty awesome. The male characters have normal looks to them that complement their personality, but nothing that stands out. The girls have this cute little face to them, with each to their own unique looks. They also have some awesome outfits to them, for example Kurisu‚Äôs ensemble with the tie and the jacket hood that makes her look pretty amazing. The setting of Akihabara was realistically, nicely drawn. As for the sound, the voice cast was absolutely superb. Mamoru Miyano (Okabe), and Kana Hanazawa (Mayuri) both starred in it; that is all the evidence you need to know how amazing the voicing was. The opening, ""Hacking to the Gate"" is one of, if not the greatest opening in anime history. It fits the anime description perfectly as well, for Okabe and co. are indeed ""Hacking to the Gate"". There were a plethora of other nice soundtracks throughout the anime as well. The music category gets an A rating from me. 
Interesting fact: Steins;Gate is based off a real scientist, named John Titor who claimed to be a time traveler from 2036. Sounds absurd and a load of bs right? But, John Titor had some interesting things to say though. He described a drastically changed future in which the United States had broken into five smaller regions, the environment and infrastructure had been devastated by a nuclear attack, and most other world powers had been destroyed; isn't that insane?! John Titor claimed the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics was correct, effectively meaning that his travel was from a parallel universe and that things could occur differently than he had predicted, the details he presented were un-falsifiable. In Steins;Gate Suzuha Amane was the character that represented John Titor.
Anyways, back to the anime, Steins;Gate is one of the best visual novel adaptations to come out ever. This anime has the qualities of a masterpiece, despite its minor flaws. Steins;Gate had brilliant execution that I've never seen done in any other anime. I stand by the 10/10 and I highly recommend this anime to anyone that is willing to pay attention and think while watching anime.",10
"
                In the spring of 2011, an anime named Steins;Gate began to air that was based off of the visual novel of the same name. It runs through the story of Okabe Rintarou, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who asserts that he is fighting against an ‚Äúevil organization‚Äù that no one but him knows about. With this absurd main character, many people who only read through the synopsis are turned off as they will believe it will be difficult to take such a man seriously. That‚Äôs only the small thin lining on the surface though; the real meat is behind that ironic exterior.
Time, an extraordinary thing that
                  means the measurement of length that a certain event or idea lasts, it‚Äôs something we all base our lives around, from deadlines we need to get done to how our daily lives are run. Out of the many stories that are born out of fascination with this concept, Steins;Gate takes the very foundation we have of time and explains that all the so-called parallel universes are all grouped into ‚Äúworld lines‚Äù. Each and every world line can not physically interact with each other, but they may indirectly interact through the transfer of memories. These transfers of memories are used as the time machines present in Steins;Gate.
The theme of time machines and their plausible impact on the world is what Steins;Gate makes so interesting. The question of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù is always there in modern stories; what if I had a time machine? ‚ÄúI could do anything from winning the lottery to giving myself the answer to that accursed math test, it would be awesome!‚Äù Steins; Gate throws all the delusions the average viewer has about time machines into the water and drags them through the real, gritty, swamp that messing with time can bring you. I loved the sheer depth of the wonderful story Steins;Gate has brought to the anime table, it didn‚Äôt matter that I wasn‚Äôt a physics major or anything of the sort. Steins;Gate weaves the story in such a way that it‚Äôs easy to understand the logistics of time and decisions the characters must face. While watching through the series the viewer is continuously thinking and making predictions: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the effect this will have? What do those words really mean? Can I even trust this person at all? As the series progresses the nature of these questions become increasingly complex and soon it reaches a point where absolutely everything is questioned: The only real truth the viewer can count on is what Okabe Rintarou believes, everything else is shaky and blurred.
The characters themselves are not slouches either. Steins;Gate‚Äôs visual novel origins are most prominent in Okabe. It excels at making the viewer feel Okabe‚Äôs frustration, his sheer pain, and his most happy moments: they will flow as if you truly are Okabe. Being based off a visual novel, it‚Äôs the relationships with the protagonist that are the most captivating part. Perhaps the most gripping thing about Okabe‚Äôs character is his relationships with the others however: the sheer lengths he goes for his friends aren‚Äôt the typical mindset most anime protagonists have these days. Measured not by their scale, but by how much he willingly burdens himself with their issues. My heart went out for Okabe multiple times when he struggled with the tough decisions that must be made to save the ones he cared for. What makes the decisions most effective on their emotional impact to the viewer is how much he simulates real life decisions so vividly: if you want something precious back, most of the time it‚Äôs going to take great lengths to get it, and you usually lose something just as precious in the process.
That is not to say the other main characters are bland however, characters such as Daru and Feyris are based off common archetypes like being the large tech-expert and ‚Äúmoe-moe‚Äù characters. They are pulled off in a generally likable manner and flesh out quite well through the course of the show. Makise, being the main heroine, is put off as a standard tsundere that grows to be Okabe‚Äôs advice consultant and the support he needs in his struggles. The genuine relationship that grows out of their unique personalities is something that will make you smile and are some of the best parts in Steins;Gate. Miyoshi is also somewhat of a support for Okabe. She doesn‚Äôt have Makise‚Äôs smarts or Daru‚Äôs expertise, but the unique role she has in their little group leads to everyone being brightened up just by her mere presence. Her role becomes heavily explored in the anime and is easily one of the most thought-provoking elements.
The presentation of the characters and story is portrayed adequately in Steins; Gate. The art shows the overall mood well enough. The realistic look Okabe has at times is done particularly well. The music pieces used during the climaxes and plot twists get the heart racing and the brain working overtime to keep up with it. The opening and ending exemplify Steins;Gate‚Äôs message well enough, having an atmosphere of deep meaning and sound appealing.
The anime itself does have a few shortcomings however, the first five episodes being the most glaring fault. I struggled to get through them, as they were necessary calm before the story really started getting pumped and I frequently found myself putting off watching the next episode because it was really just painfully slow. Such is the weakness in story-driven anime, the rising action arc is usually difficult to push through.
The ending is also a cause of debate among many fans. I won‚Äôt spoil it, but there are many loose ends and plot holes (Miyoshi and Okabe‚Äôs childhood encounter being the strangest one) that the anime does leave off.
Overall, Steins;Gate successfully does what it wants to do: it takes the viewer into the eyes of Okabe Rintarou, and makes them endure the struggles and conflicts that would shatter any common man. There is good reason why it was one of the top anime in 2011, and it ranks up there with The Girl Who Leapt Through Time as a defining anime in its category.

                Just spent the last 10 hours re-watching Steins;Gate, running on no sleep and having drank about 6 cups of coffee and eaten a ton of snacks...
allow me to improv a bit:
---
MUAHUAHUAHUA CHRISTINA, YOU HAVE FINALLY REALIZED MY GENIUS. INITIATE PLAN ULDRGHEIST. I, HOUOUIN KYOUMA, WILL IMPLEMENT THE PLAN SET FORTH TO ME BY STEINS GATE, AND-
Plan rejected, stupid name. And there's no -tina.VERY WELL THE ZOMBIE-
That's not my name either!
Okariiin, tuturuuu! Mayushii brought snacks!
Ahh Mayuri, this tastes really good, it's melting in my mouth.
Heehee, could you say that again Kurisu-channn? ""It's melting in my mouth"". Heehee...
ooooohhh, baka hentai, urusai!
HELLO. YES, IT'S ME. YES, SEND REINFORCEMENTS, IT APPEARS WE'VE BEEN INFILTRATED BY A PERVERTED ASSISTANT-
I'm not your assistant!
---
I forgot how awesome this anime was. 
I would sit here and write you an essay on why you should watch Steins Gate, but if the above conversation wasn't enough to get you interested,  here's a bit more to push you over the edge:
- Time travel.
- The greatest mad scientist to ever exist.
- A tsundere... that actually contributes towards the plot. Tell me the last time you've seen one of those (hint hint NGE).
- An adorable cast, and absolutely perfect voice acting.
Now, if you're extremely picky, there CAN be some plot holes with the time traveling, but that's to be expected, it's fucking time travel. How would you expect there to be perfect explanations for something that the best scientists think is physically impossible?
Tired of reading? Yeah, I'm tired of writing too. Plus, I might have given away too much information. Time to execute Plan Sleep.

                Not seeing why this show has so much hype Ill try to explain
Story: Just ur average time travel anime that also is some kinda murder mystery that does nothing new or unique but is somehow praised to high heaven show is full of plot holes, plot conveniences, characters lack complexity, lack depth, full of tropes. Also, they try to make this show seem super smart but is filled with wrong and stupid mathematical and logical theories. (Rewatch) I rewatched it for a second time and have come to realize that at episode 13 the plot just rewinds to ep 1, so this story never HAD
                  A SOLID PLOT. As after rewatching again anything that left me in suspense was played with the I‚Äôve got a time machine card. Anytime I was like dang dude plot getting thick here wonder what Okabe will do...OH YEA THANK GOD FOR LAZY HANDWRITING. Imma jUst TrAVeL BaCk iN tImE. 
Character: Lots of them I don't even remember their names, Okabe is literally a copy and pasted version of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz from Phineas and Ferb. Then there's that one girl that goes dootoroo dootoroo one word annoying every time she got screen time it was torture and then Kurisu lets be honest you just wanted the main characters too bang.
Art: Frontier Works has a reputation of visually making a show amazing, only to another shows visually appalling. In this case, they did a good job
Sound: Not memorable don't remember a thing maybe  one of the openings was ok but that's pitty points from me
Enjoyment: A rollercoaster I didn't drop it because when I was about to, there would be a plot that seemed very promising but only to be quickly killed by some other plot. The process was the same over and over. 
Overall: Steins;Gate is just a show you can turn ur brain off to and watch.",4

                Story 9/10
The story of Steins Gate is really well done. The viewer experiences a story that will leave leave them on the edge of their seats wanting to know what is going to happen next. For an anime or any story for that matter to have time travel as their main focus and not have any noticeable plot holes is an impressive feat. The only reason I can give the story a 9 instead of a 10 is the pacing in the first 7 or so episodes is too slow. Although this adds to the character development some people may be put off in this
                  time.
Art 9/10
The art in Steins Gate is different to most other anime. It is more realistic and dark. There is no real point where I thought oh that looks amazing. But the art really does fit this show. I feel if it was done in a different way it might have taken away some of the immersion.
Sound 10/10
The sub and the dub are both great and I would recommend either of them its just a matter of personal preference. 
Character 10/10
Steins Gate's characters are really well developed and a short way into the anime I felt like I could relate to these characters and understood their motives for everything they did in the end. Every character I found to be interesting in their own way.
Enjoyment 10/10
Both times I have watched it I was left with a void that only a true masterpiece can leave. I had grown attached to a lot of the characters and when it finished I wanted more.
Overall 10/10
This anime is the only anime I have seen that has handled time travel really well which I imagine to be quite a hard topic to tackle in this medium. Overall the characters sound story and art make this a must see anime that I would recommend to anyone.",10
"
                Steins;Gate, a generic visual novel adaptation that everyone loves to circle jerk. The characters are contrived and irritating, the pacing is inconsistent, the story is mediocre. I don't see how people can look past these flaws and still like this anime. 
The first half was terrible and everyone knows it, yet various opinions on the internet tell you push through and it gets good, but it doesn't. How can a show with a crappy first half and OK second half be considered good? My guess would be because everyone wants to think they understand time travel and this show helps the stroke their own ego.
                  Other reasons would probably be the chuunibyou trope main character that weeaboos love, Hanakana forcing out a catch phrase that would probably sound like rusty metal scraping together if it wasn't her saying it, and pervert jokes that only cherry-boys find clever.
I watched this show when it came out, and again recently- it's still meh. 2/5
Except for that trap. Saving grace of the show. 2.5/5",5
"
                -Story 10/10-
The story is exceptionally well done. It begins as a rather common but nice trio in a weird lab that mostly looks like just a small apartment and then some people join in as they get deeper and deeper into their quest to get a functional time machine.
As the episodes goes by the plot thickens, you go from ‚Äúhmm it's interesting‚Äù to ‚Äúwait, I actually did not completely understand that, better rewind...‚Äù. At approximately the middle of the anime it gets really deep without using the usual ‚ÄúDeus Ex Machina‚Äù that most intellectual plots tend to use to fill plot holes. Speaking of plot
                  holes, I actually had the feeling that some little things, that are not even worth considering seeing as how great the anime is, were not perfectly clear, but, as I have just said, don't mind me, I just feel my review needs to mention that to be complete.
Another point, and I'll be blunt, I did cry like a little bitch, not with a torrent of human water, but those honest tears that are watering your eyes and that you can't suppress. The anime is damn good at making you sad without overusing it, but don't worry, it made up for it since it is mostly a joyful one.
Mostly a ‚Äúslice of life‚Äù anime with a great background story. I can understand it if some people think they're both worth the same ‚Äúlevel‚Äù, but I find the main plot to be an excuse at depicting the characters and their environment, struggles.
-Art 9/10-
Honestly, with how focused I was on the story and what was going to happen I did not pay too much attention on this part. I did however notice that the character design was spot on, every character had matching looks and personality without too much ‚Äúunexplainable kawai power‚Äù.
There aren't too much places, but there's no need for more, they're all useful and perfectly fine.
As for special effects it's kinda refreshing because I've noticed very few of them, even counting the lightning one.
-Sound 9/10-
The opening, while good on the graphic part, was a little disappointment for me. The beginning got me like ‚ÄúHey, that sounds kinda nice.‚Äù and as it got into the main part I was mostly in ‚Äúmeh‚Äù mode, but don't worry, it's not horrible.
There are a few soundtracks, which are all perfectly serving the purpose of going along with what happens on screen and making the mood clearer.
-Character 10/10 -
And here we are, to the best part of all, the characters. It's been a long time since I've last noticed such a perfect ‚Äúcasting‚Äù.
We have Okabe, ahem, Kyouma, the mad scientist. The main protagonist, a grown-up not unlike a certain Peter Pan in a sense. He's childish, but really care for the people who are close to him. Even if he does talks about a lot of nonsense is smarter than what anybody would think and is an endearing character. El Psy Congroo~
Then comes Mayushii, the simple and carefree childhood friend of Kyouma. She's extremely cute and even I, who has a hard time caring for characters, got hooked in no time to her. I won't say too much about her, because it's almost all there is to say, without spoiling, about this adorable character. Tuturu~
We have one of Kyouma's only friend, Hashida. He's a ‚ÄúSupa haka‚Äù -gets smashed with a keyboard- Ahem. He's a computer genius, hacking into complex defence systems without too much work. He's also an eroge fan, sometimes mentioning his 2D girlfriends, you could call him a full-time pervert, but he's not dangerous at all.
And the last main protagonist, Makise Kurisu. I usually dislike the ‚Äúhard to get‚Äù type of girls, but she is so bad at hiding the real meaning of her words that you can quickly get over it. She's a young genius, theorizing about time travel and memories treatment. She has a tough outer layer, but is a kind young woman who holds her fair share of hardships. Like most characters you'll get attached to her very easily.
Then there are the other ‚Äúsupporting characters‚Äù. To be honest, for most of them, they did not feel any less important than the main characters. I did have some ill will about one of them, but that's how the story can mess with your mind with such talent. 
I'll just write this here, but, there's one of the cutest trap of all times in a shrine maiden outfit -whistle-.           
-Enjoyment 10/10-
Ten out of ten. As I've already said I went from genuine curiosity to die hard marathon mode in no time. Seeing as how popular this anime is I thought it was going to disappoint me since I'm such a smartass, but never have I been so wrong.
If you're searching for an anime that can make you smile, cry and leave a strong memory into your anime fan brain then do not think twice about it and press play as soon as you can watch it!",10

                Steins;Gate is an extremely enjoyable, visually pleasing journey that combines a good science-fiction thriller with a heart-wrenching examination of the lengths people will go for their friends and loved ones. Unfortunately, the series is hurt by being too faithful to the visual novel, causing pacing and characters to suffer as a result, as well as a final plot twist that egregiously voids much of the thematic points. These flaws keep Steins;Gate from becoming a true masterpiece.
Story:7
+Engaging science-fiction plot blends surprisingly well with the more intimate plot dealing with the relationships between the main cast
+""quasi-realistic"" setting complements the more intimate plot
+strong emotional impact
- awful pacing in
                  the first half of the series
- series finale's plot twist creates plot holes and voids the thematic lesson of the series.
Steins;Gate was originally a visual novel, and those conventions of storytelling structure are translated over into the anime series, largely for the worse. While expository set-up is always necessary in connecting the viewers with characters, Steins;Gate takes this to an extreme, dragging out the pacing in the first half of the story to make sure you've met each and every single character that you will encounter in the story.
In this 24 episode series, it takes fully 6 or 7 episodes before the fledgling elements of the overall plot appear, and another 4 before the central conflict that is meant to drive the story becomes established. For viewers watching the series because they expected some sort of science-fiction-driven storyline, this crawling pace can be frustrating, and each hint of relevant technology becomes as infuriatingly teasing as the fruits dangling in front of Tantalus.   
Once those elements finally do come into play however, Steins;Gate weaves a very engaging story that makes just enough references to real-world places and people to ground the story enough to keep it from becoming too fantastic. This is an excellent choice because in truth, the real story of Steins;Gate plays out between it's cast of characters, rather than through the time-travel element. The emotional effectiveness of the series is facilitated by this almost-our-world-but-not-quite setting, because it is very very easy for the viewer to place him or herself there, and thus also share in the sorrow and triumphs of the characters.
My initial reaction upon watching the opening and realizing that the characters were almost all overwhelmingly female was concern that the story would devolve into creating ""harem"" situations. Fortunately, aside from two episodes involving characters who probably had bigger roles in the visual novel, Steins;Gate avoids that, focusing instead on the relationship between the primary characters.
The major human themes running through Steins;Gate deal with concepts of fate (or at least the pre-determination-or lack thereof), the struggle to correct past mistakes, the difficulty in coming to terms with hard truths, letting go, and moving forward. The focus here is on extremely human and intimate concepts-the usual themes of dystopia or displacing effects of ubiquitous technology found in sci-fi settings are largely absent, and at most,  only lip-service is paid. Time travel and cause-and-effect are also featured, but usually serve to drive the more intimate themes forward.  Given these themes, Steins;Gate avoids having an overly serious tone-dramatic moments are appropriately scored and acted, while lighter moments are done so without going into exaggerated hi-jinks either.
Even with such bad pacing, Steins;Gate's excellent human drama would have earned it higher marks, if not for an egregious final plot twist/deus ex machina. Almost certainly designed to create a tidy and emotionally satisfying conclusion for the protagonist and viewer, it in fact creates plot holes while cheapening an important thematic point.
Art:9
+high quality animation and backgrounds
+distinctive character designs
The art style for Steins;Gate is pretty conventional, but it is top-quality, especially the backgrounds set in Akiba, while the CGI elements blend seamlessly with the rest of the animation. Characters are distinctive without being exaggerated, aside from one over-muscled side character.
Sound:7
+Opening and closing feel appropriate for the sci-fi setting of the story
+Voice acting does not sound overdone or exaggerated
-The same opening and closing are out of place for the first half of the series
Note: This is a review of a subtitled version with the original audio
The soundtrack and voice acting for Steins;Gate are appropriate but unremarkable-nothing stood out as being particularly good, but there were no instances of dissonance either. Although I don't understand Japanese, the voice-acting felt appropriate both for characters and the tone of the scene-thankfully none of the characters felt overacted, even though the story was ripe with potential pitfalls of the sort.
The opening notes/chirps of Steins;Gate, ""Hacking to the Gate,"" sounds appropriate for the technology/sci-fi theme, and the opening sequence itself makes the show seem like it will be a dramatic science-fiction adventure (gears! Vector lines!) with elements of a harem anime (all important characters show up, and they just happen to be almost all girls). Unfortunately, the series doesn't really deliver on the first for 11 episodes, but thankfully it also avoids doing too much of the second.
I found the closing to be pretty much unremarkable. The dramatic tone suited the emotional drama of the series, but it did not stand out.
Character: 9
+(mostly) likable, sympathetic characters
+ great character development arc for the main protagonist
+ wonderful chemistry between the core cast
- Somewhat cliched, archetypal characters
- some ostensibly important characters feel like they could be removed with minimal effects to the plot or overall feel of the story
- main character's eccentricity out of proportion to the rest of characters, and poorly explained, if at all
- Character development for main protagonist does not happen until the second half
Steins;Gate establishes its effective emotional drama with likable characters that have sympathetic needs and wishes that are thrust against the main struggle. The chemistry between the characters is believable and genuinely pleasant to watch, with one particularly notable and dark exception.
This is good, because most of the cast could be un-generously dismissed as little more than an archetype+some sort of emotional baggage. Main heroine Kurisu is tsundere, (actually pointed out within the anime) and Mayuri and Ruka are quintessential cases of moe. In addition, some of the secondary characters, while possibly more developed in the visual novel, simply don't serve much of a purpose in the the anime beyond acting as an extra link in a problem-solving chain. removing them and their plot effects entirely would arguably make for a tighter, better paced story.
The main protagonist, Rintaro Okabe, is initially introduced as a ridiculously eccentric character who demands to be referred to by his mad scientist persona, ""Kyoma Hooin,"" and for most of the first half of the series, alternates between insufferably arrogant, paranoid, or completely clueless. These traits are played to caricature, far more so than any other character, and were nearly enough to make me stop watching. Additionally, Okabe's brilliance is meant to be taken at other characters word- the anime fails to adhere to the ""show, don't tell"" model of storytelling.
Fortunately, the mid-series critical plot twist and catalyst for the plot drama also tones down and grounds Okabe, making him human rather than character. After this point, Okabe becomes incredibly sympathetic and very likable, and the series actually shows us his development and internal conflict. It is a shame that it takes nearly half the series before this happens, but the fact that by the end of the story you sympathize with Okabe so much shows how well-executed this transformation is, and within such a short remainder of time.
Enjoyment: 9
In my opinion, Steins;Gate should ideally have been pared down to a more tightly paced 16 episodes, and to be frank, the last two episodes of the series should be completely omitted.
But despite my criticism of the pacing, plot, and characters, I still found Steins;Gate to be an extremely enjoyable series. In truth, I actually gave up twice on the series while trying to get through the first six episodes, but once I got beyond the halfway mark, I was hooked. That is testament to the masterful human drama of the series, and just how good Steins;Gate is when it is at its best. As is, those who are more forgiving of long exposition and excessively eccentric characters will have no problem getting into what is on balance an excellent anime series.",8

Summary: ‚ÄúIf you relish the idea of a gripping and thought-provoking anime, set against a mysterious and ominous backdrop, and spiced with humor and emotional moments, you could not go wrong in watching Steins;Gate.‚Äù
Introduction:
Steins;Gate is perfect. It is the epitome of psychology, the embodiment of intrigue, and the quintessence of written art. It stands above all anime which have come before it. It excels. It micrifies all of its predecessors in all mediums, be they novels, manga,
                  anime, or films. It radiates brilliance. To say that anime actually existed before the rise of Steins;Gate is false. Everything in the future, nay, the future itself, will gaze with awe toward the pinnacle of beauty that is Steins;Gate and find inspiration and hope. Steins;Gate is a sufficient reason for one‚Äôs existence. If Shakespeare or Tolkien were to read the plot of Steins;Gate, they would see their first glimpse of true greatness and be humbled. Like a many faceted diamond, there are many brilliant faces to Steins;Gate: plot, characters, setting, art, character dynamics, humor, and theme; and none of these faces are anything less than perfect. Already since the creation of Steins;Gate, the world has become a significantly better place. Criminals are left with no desire to harm others. Governments strive toward newfound benevolence. All people love each other out of heartfelt generosity. Those who experience Steins;Gate reach a level of existence beyond that of anyone else. To not watch it is to be missing an aspect of your life. The story of Steins;Gate commands your attention by the sheer authority of its breathtaking development. Steins;Gate wins. It displays truth to a nearly matchless extent. It is a necessary part of the world and of life. Through all of these observations, one solid and faultless truth is found. Steins;Gate is perfect.
Glad to get that out of my system. Now, the objective review.
Story:
The plot of Steins;Gate is well thought out, creative, and captivating. Intrigue pulls you into the plot of Steins;Gate, and as you continue watching, you yearn to know what happens next as choices are made and mysteries dazzlingly unraveled. While some revelations are not hard to guess at beforehand, others leave you speechless. I have had several chills run down my back as I learn some of the amazing truths behind the original surface of the plot, whether the identities of certain characters, or the reasons for certain events. That being said, I'm also glad at where the author did not choose to leave the viewer guessing. For example, right from the start of the anime, you know who the enemy (organization) is. Also, it does not take long before the characters clearly learn how to achieve certain feats. But because of this, you end up wondering ""what will the characters do with this? How will they escape the enemy?"" These types of questions, though they don't leave you looking for hints or decrypting riddles, are mysteries of their own, and they keep you clicking ""next"" after every episode.
Psychology/Theme:
I'm a great fan of psychological anime. When I say psychological, I do not mean mentally torturous, as in mind-f or horror. I mean thought-provoking. Anime with choices to be made. Consequences for those choices. Themes running through actions. Steins;Gate excels in all of these areas; and it should, since the plot is built on a concept fraught with consequences - time travel. Nearly every episode in Steins;Gate, there are choices to be made. At first, choices are made quite easily, and great joy comes from the characters' actions. As the plot progresses, however, consequences begin to appear, and we learn that nothing is as simple as it seems. A tension appears between choices' benefits and their consequences. This tension progressively builds until it seems like saving some any hope or dream requires crushing others. The butterfly's wings are flapping.
Characters:
The characters of Steins;Gate are fantastically creative and compelling. Several of them seem, at first glance, to exemplify certain anime stereotypes. But as you experience more of the story, you get to watch the actions of these characters, hear their opinions and thoughts, and realize that for each of them, there is more going on than meets the eye. This is especially true for Kyouma. As the story progresses, he learns more about the consequences of time travel, and he learns more about the other characters, and his enemies. You begin to see beneath his epically flamboyant exterior a thoughtful man whose joy is beginning to be sapped by the circumstances around him.
On the lighter side, all the characters are also really entertaining. Despite the overall serious nature of the anime, there are amusing aspects to each of the characters; from Kyouma‚Äôs spurts of ‚Äúmadness‚Äù to Daru‚Äôs perverted jokes and net-references, to Kurisu‚Äôs overt tsundere-ness. These fun aspects lead to many entertaining moments. The occasional romance also adds to the entertainment. Nothing definitive really happens, but there are plenty of amusing and sometimes meaningful moments between Kyouma and a couple of the others.
Sound:
I never noticed much about the music of Steins;Gate. Looking back, though, that's just because it matched the scenes so well. There are definitely both intense and subtle moments in the music, paired well with the plot. The opening and ending also match the anime quite well, and have (to some extent) both an epic and meaningful feel to them. There's nothing ridiculously powerful like Tori no Uta or A Moon Filled Sky, but those both come from solely drama/romance-focused anime, and Steins;Gate isn't that type of anime, so it's not going to have those types of tracks.
Animation:
I'm not a great connoisseur of animation, but the animation of Steins;Gate seems smooth and appealing. It's unique without being weird. Backgrounds are detailed and characters are portrayed well visually.
Conclusion:
The plot of Steins;Gate is well thought out, creative, and captivating. The themes are deep and the choices complex and sometimes painful. The characters are entertaining and fascinating. The sound and animation suit the anime well and make it more amazing. If you relish the idea of a gripping and thought-provoking anime, set against a mysterious and ominous backdrop, and spiced with humor and emotional moments, you could not go wrong in watching Steins;Gate.",10

                If you're reading this review, you probably heard or read somewhere that this is one of the best anime ever made. My advice to you, Steins;Gate watchers is don't get your hopes up. 
This anime was so hyped up that I felt like people were rubbing it in my face. The result of that: I did not find this anime all that great. 
I was warned that the first few episodes would get me confused and that I'd understand better further in to the story, but I felt like I figured out the first episode pretty fast and then was confused here and there for
                  the next 23 parts.
I would say that the cause is because the show is a bit unclear on detail, probably because of the high possibility in hitting a paradox point (which i think they did anyway) I also found it difficult to remember what they were doing after a while. Since so many threads were started and a lot of things happened between start and goal, I kind of forgot why they were doing it all for and which of all problems they were solving.
Though some would say it's a bit of a comedy I didn't find it funny at all but I did find the story interesting (from episode 9. The episodes before that was a drag for me personally).  
I also have to say that I really respect the character development of the main character, Okarin.  I feel like he grew a lot from start to finish and that I grew with him. When the journey ended it felt like I had gone through an entire life time. The other characters were very lovable as well though I didn't feel a strong connection to all of them. I thought many of them were a bit too much and a bit annoying. 
I also found that the twists were not really twisty. They were kind of easy to figure out before hand. Not to mention some details that were not explained or didn't really match up to the rest of the events.
I did like that it got darker further in to the anime. It kind of gave it a heavier atmosphere and you kind of feel how heavy your mind becomes. It could be out of sympathy, empathy, Sadness or just brain damage from keeping track of all the time leaping. I think i got a bit of all of them. 
I am over all very happy that i watched this anime. The art style gave me an ""insane"" feeling from the start like it was telling you to get ready for some psychological damage. I absolutely loved how they managed to get me to feel what i imagine the characters were feeling in that environment. It helped me feel fear or disgust as well, at some parts. 
The soundtrack was literally not memorable. Of course i remember the opening but the rest is completely out of my brain. 
Although i said a lot of negative things about this anime, i really did like it and the chance of me watching it again is high. 
P.S I'm sorry about the sucky structure of this review. I had a lot i wanted to get written down but not enough energy to construct it. :D",8

                Story - 10. Art - 10. Sound - 10. Character 10. Overall. 10/fucking 10. There's not really much to explain. This truly is a legendary anime, probably one of the best I have seen in a while. El. Psy. Congroo.
Story - 10/10
The story is.. too epic. I love science-fiction, furthermore I love time-travel fiction, and this story pulls it off quite well. A mad scientist, Okabe Rintarou or Hououin Kyouma as his mad scientist name, starts up a future gadget research laboratory to create incredibly futuristic gadgets. All of them are quite boring, and the only one that is remotely interesting, is the Phone Microwave,
                  which turns bananas into green-gel. But, after Okabe sends a text message to the 'Super Hakar' Hashida Itaru, or Daru, since Daru's phone was connected to the Phone Microwave, this caused Okabe to send a text message to the past. After figuring this out, well, Okabe does a bunch of shit and shit goes down after that. The story takes a turn and ends up being about trying to save one person from dying.
Art - 10/10
The animation, the character design, everything is drawn, animated whatever, perfectly. You know why? I don't know. It was made in the 2010s? How the hell should I know? Maybe a professional animator animated it? Don't ask me. Ask White Fox I guess. But, as I was saying, the animation and the character designs are perfect, and I keep almost spelling perfect as 'prefect' so I'ma stop using perfect now.
Sound - 10/10
A lot of the music in the anime series is used countless times, but, WHO CARES? It's great music, and the opening of the anime is great too. But, for some reason, they changed the words in the last two episodes. Unless I was hallucinating, on drugs, something, but I don't know why they changed the words.
Character - 10/10
Moments between characters have me slipping off of my seat, dripping wet to get some mo-... What... was I saying? But the characters are incredibly awesome, and I love each and every one of them and the story behind all of them. The four main characters I love, Okabe Rintarou, Hashida Itaru, Makise Kurisu and Shiina Mayuri, but the others are also awesome like, Urushibara Ruka, Akiha Rumiho and there's lots of others I could go over that are incredible... Moeka Kiryuu.
Overall - 10/10 (obviously)
Obviously this is given a 10/10 complete score, because I can't rate story, art, sound and character 10 and give the anime a overall rating of 1. So, obviously, this gets a 10/10 score and is truly an amazing anime and I would recommend it to anyone who loves science fiction or time travel fiction. And, anyone else. Because this anime is awesome, no matter who you are or what you like, it's awesome.
""Hey mister, I am mad scientist. It's SO COOOOOL!!! Sonovabitch.""",10
"
                I‚Äôve come to the realization that my past 3 reviews have been pretty overtly negative, so I felt like writing a positive review for once, either that or it was the choice of the Steins;Gate that I chose to write this, either way, let's get started
Story:
The story of Steins;Gate is about a rag-tag group of lab-members discovering that they can travel through time. 
I know that plot-synopsis of Steins;Gate is basic as fuck, & probably doesn‚Äôt tell you much about the story, but I‚Äôd like to keep the story of Steins;Gate as spoiler free as possible. With that being said, the story of Steins;Gate is
                  fairly complicated, but it‚Äôs not difficult to grasp or understand. It achieves a great balance of being a complex storyline with many twists & turns along the way, but it never becomes overbearing, difficult to follow, or unnecessarily complicated. I don‚Äôt want to spoil what our group of lab members will get into, as everything in Steins;Gate has a meaning that, would be outright spoilers if I started explaining them, so I‚Äôll contain myself
Characters:
Steins;Gate has one of my favorite cast of characters in all of anime. Every last one of them have unique personality traits, & all contribute to the plot in some way. Okabe‚Äôs antics are just a joy to watch, Kurisu is the lab member there to keep every-one on track with her serious & stern personality. Mayuri is the exact kind of some-what innocent character that a series like Steins;Gate would need, & Daru is quite the lad himself. Those are just the main 4 lab-members. For the sake of staying as spoiler free as possible, I won‚Äôt mention all of them. I will say however, that every last one of them has an arc they go through in the show. All of them are fleshed out, & all of them contribute something to the narrative at large. 
Art:
Steins;Gate has incredible artwork on all fronts. Character designs are distinct from one another & incredibly memorable. On top of that though, the character designs all reflect the personalities marvelously, you get a great idea of who these characters are & what they‚Äôre like just by looking at them. Backgrounds are also well designed & have a sublime level of effort put into each & everyone of them. Steins;Gate does make use of CGI, but it‚Äôs blended well & compliments the scenery, you can hardly tell it‚Äôs CGI if you don‚Äôt have an eye for that sort of thing.
The animation in Steins;Gate is, of course, excellent. Even the greatest attention to the smallest of details have been taken into account, so even the most static of shots in the series are exciting & a joy to look at. The action scenes are just as well done as the scenes where the characters are just standing around talking to each other & explaining the intricacies & science of the show. 
The Storyboarding is also spectacular, every shot leads into one another so seamlessly & gives the show a flow that I really have yet to see in other shows. The directing is also great, the framing, compositional work, & editing are all as equally on point as the storyboarding is, so I have no complaints there
Sound:
The voice acting in Steins;Gate is incredible, these aren‚Äôt people in the booth, these are the characters themselves in the booth. Miyano Mamoru as Okabe is the huge stand-out performance, but I don‚Äôt want to undersell the talents of actors such as ‚ÄúKana Hanazawa‚Äù, ‚ÄúHaruko Momoi‚Äù & ‚ÄúYukari Tamura‚Äù as Mayuri, Suzuha, & Faris respectively. 
The music in Steins;Gate is good, but not one of Steins;Gate‚Äôs stronger aspects in my opinion. It‚Äôs all good stuff that sets the tone of a scene masterfully, but the music is a bit too atmospheric to be memorable in my opinion. Still though, it‚Äôs not bad stuff at all, just weaker comparatively too all the unbelievably strong aspects about this show.
Overall:
If I could sum up Steins;Gate in one word, I‚Äôd go with ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù. Steins;Gate really doesn‚Äôt have any glaring flaws to it, I really don‚Äôt have anything negative to say about the show. The characters are all likeable & memorable beings. The story is complex but not hard to understand, achieving a great balance. The visual craftsmanship on display is well made. The directing & storyboarding are expertly done, & the music, which I said was probably the weakest aspect of the series, was still great & just adds to the series. So with everything said, my final rating of Steins;Gate is going to be a deserving 10/10. I implore anyone reading to stop what they‚Äôre doing & go watch the series, & if you‚Äôve seen the series already, well go rewatch it. Treat yourself with a good anime. P.S, Steins;Gate has one of the best 1st episodes in anime I‚Äôve ever seen. It also isn‚Äôt badly paced in the 1st half either.",10
"
                Quite honestly, I can into this anime expecting some masterpiece, seeing as it got so much praise and was considered a must watch for fans of the psychological thriller. 
Story:
In terms of plot, it takes almost forever to get to anything remotely interesting. The first twelve episodes we are supposed to be focusing on the characters and their dynamics, but my main problem with this is that the characters aren't even good so it makes it a boring experience. Once you bypass that, we finally get into the main part of the plot everyone praises frequently, but honestly, I don't understand the hype at all.
                  Yes, some events are shocking, but then it gets way too repetitive and lessens the seriousness of the situation. Steins:Gate had really good potential, but I feel it was wasted because they didn't take the plot and characters serious enough so they could add in cute waifus in turn (such as the pink haired cat girl which honestly I couldn't take seriously at all.) If I could describe it in two words, I would call it ""fake deep"", because the anime seriously tries it's best to seem deep and meaningful but falls short of that spectacularly.
Characters:
I have a bone to pick with like, almost all the characters. 
Firstly, the protagonist Okabe is actually not that bad, I feel he was a pretty realisitic character for the most part and was entertaining enough. (at least in comparison to everyone else).
However, Makise on the other hand I felt was way too underdeveloped and plain. Like, at first I was interested because she was said to be such a renown scientist that was extremely intelligent, but her actual personality is just broken down to being ""tsundere"" and smart for lack of better words. The small amount of development she does get is when she relies on the main character, which tbh makes her seem like she's only a character there to be the protagonists love interest.
Ruka was a cute character, but I hate how their arc is handled. It's honestly kind of disrespectful to both transgender people and gay people. They imply that Ruka  wants to become a girl solely because Ruka is gay and wants to be with the main character (which is just like... no bro who does that). This is super confusing to decipher, and it feels like Ruka is the side ""gay"" character that is just there in order to make the main character look like such a good person for accepting an lgbt person. 
Itaru was just.... like comedy relief I guess? But I never once found him funny and his constant remarks towards the women that made them uncomfortable made me cringe. He didn't really add anything for me besides the fact that he was smart and a pervert which is basically what his character was boiled down to in the actual anime.
As for Mayuri, I think she had potential, but once again Steins;Gate focused all their attention onto the main character so they forgot to give all the other characters complex/realistic personalities. She kind of comes off as unrealistic, I guess that's normal for anime, but as for an anime that's trying to be a thriller, I don't think that was the best course of action.
Fairis definitely made me question my decision to watch this anime. I came here expecting some cool thriller sci-fi adventure through time and here I see the cat girl saying nya every sentence. Like ok, I get it, it's anime... But like seriously. This anime was trying to be serious with her backstory and stuff but I could not even feel sorry for her because she didn't even seem real to me, the whole time I was questioning why they decided to put a character like this in.
Art/Sound
I'm not going to come hate on the art, because many series can be good even with bad art, so the art here was decent, not really my cup of tea but that plot is what really is relevant. However the music and stuff I found that I actually did enjoy it and it was cool so no complaints there.
Overall
Overall, series is way too overhyped but it has a few good points. Once again, it just felt very cheap to me, like they were trying to achieve something that makes you question life but it just made me question why I wasted my time watching the anime. Feel free to watch, but I just don't see the appeal so I wouldn't recommend watching all 24 episodes if you don't want to risk wasting time.",6

                SPOILER FREE***
Hailed as a masterpiece and one of the top anime of all time. Prepared to be disappointed! This anime is a harem fantasy disguises as science fiction. Pretentious and boring, the cult like following artificially elevates its score. It deserves some points for being unique, but that says more about the industry and the fans than it does about the anime itself. Prepare for mediocrity and maybe you can kill some time with it.
Story:
The story starts off incredibly slow as the creators could really have distilled it down, really a lot of missed potential. After making it past the painful first third, your treated
                  to some suspense that makes the disappointing finish all the more of the letdown. In summary, this anime leaves a lot to be desired and it just a lot of wasted potential. Time travel in storytelling is a way for storytelling to avoid consequences and this show is ultimately letdown in telling a competent story.
Sound:
Unmemorable music, but OK sound effects and buildup.
Characters:
A harem story. The main character is an otaku who is a charlatan science guy who magically creates a way to time-travel. Enter the one-dimensional female characters of different flavors who grow to like->love him for no logical reason. This is a dream come true for otaku story and that probably explains the cult following.
Overall:
In the end, this anime is a showcase of unfulfilled potential. The storytelling is shallow and the story is pseudo-intelligent and stuffed full with irreverent filler. The characters are what you might except out of a harem game. One of those anime you wish you liked but infinitely forgettable. Maybe give it a skim to see what the hype is about but feel free to skip this one.",3
"
                I'm upset after watching this anime. I'm upset that such a subpar anime is receiving as much recognition as it is. 
Most of the characters range from pointless to downright awful. Moeka and Shouichi are two of the worst characters I have seen in fiction and hold no place in any story that takes itself seriously. Ruka and Fenris are just pointless and bring nothing to the table. The story bends over backwards to make Kurisu as likeable as possible to the point were it comes off as contrived. The only truly good character (imo at least) was Okabe.
The ending is at best boring and
                  unoriginal and at it's worst completely contrived and unrealistic. Guy gets the girl, all the good guys end up happy, badguy is just some heartless dick who gets what is coming to him and everything wraps itself up nicely. This is all fine and good if you only want to see the characters happy, but I went into this thinking it would actually try to make you think or try to think outside the box a little. Instead your given the most cliche cut and dry ending possible to the point where the story has to bend over backwards just to make it work. Characters start remembering timelines they have no reason to be able to remember because the story says so, and the final confrontation just has each character acting dumber then the last. It's lazy, unoriginal and frankly just poorly written.
The pacing is off too. I don't mind the slow start, and I thought the middle of the series is the one aspect that was genuinely fantastic and engaging, but then it cuts away from everyone so the main character can start going on dates with the useless side characters around the city followed by the completely garbage climax. It's as if the writers got to the ending of episode 16 and then just gave up trying to make an engaging story. whoever thought it was a good idea for the ending arc to be a compilation of Okabe going on dates is a moron.
And then theres the movie which adds NOTHING to the series and is just a cheap cash grab by showing more Okabe/Kurisu proving that it's ok to recycle the EXACT SAME STORY AND ADD NOTHING as long as you don't forget the artificial emotional payoff.
To all the people who said this is a masterpiece. Screw you for making me think this anime would be worthwhile.  Try watching something that at least tries to bring something new to the table and is actually thought provoking. I'm sure my review will get down voted like crazy (I've written reviews on Bleach to similar effect) but the honest truth is there are so many better and thought provoking stories out there that deserve more attention then they ever get that should be experienced before this one.
Is this anime bad? No. It's a 6/10 in my books despite all of my ranting. I just can't help but be angry when I read comments like ""this anime is a masterpiece that you must experience"" It's not, by any stretch of the imagination. FMA:B and Clannad I can understand even though they're not my favorites.. I can at least see what they bring to the table, but I'm completely dumbfounded with this one.",6

                Story: (10/10)
Steins;Gate tackles the always difficult concept of time-travel, and does so marvelously. The story focuses on Okabe Rintarou, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, and his friends as they attempt to create various gadgets, one of which is a time machine, of sorts. They invent a machine that can send text messages into the past, altering the present in various ways. The plot mostly focuses on using this technology to stop an organization known as SERN from taking over the world in the future. I can't say much more about the plot without spoiling something, but the story is absolutely incredible. There will be moments where
                  you are scratching your head at some of the intricacies of time travel, laughing at the rather hilarious dialogue, and you'll be on the edge of your seat in many moments. The story is somewhat complex, so you will need to give the show your full attention to truly understand what is going on. Really my only small complaint about the story is that it does take several episodes to get going. You will have absolutely no idea what is going on after the first episode, and really the next few after that, but if you stick with it everything eventually comes together and makes sense. I can honestly say that it is one of the best stories I've ever seen, and you should absolutely watch Steins;Gate to experience it.
Art: (8/10)
Steins;Gate's art won't blow you away really, but it is still quite good. It has a much more realistic feel to it, and that certainly is not a bad thing. The characters are all drawn very well and the environments look great as well.
Sound: (9/10)
The opening is great, not the best I've ever seen but still really good. The background music is very good at times, helping to paint the appropriate atmosphere for various scenes, although I feel like it could be slightly better in places. (For the dub) The voice acting is excellent all around, I especially love Okabe's voice actor, all of his dialogue is a joy to listen to, and the other characters are great as well.
Character: (9/10)
The characters are all fantastic. They're all written in such a way as to make it impossible for you to really dislike any of them. Some of the characters fall somewhat into typical archetypes, such as Daru being a typical nerd and Kurisu being somewhat of a tsundere, but they're all great characters in their own way. Also while I feel like many of the characters get little development, you can really see how Okabe changes over the course of the show, due to the very stressful events that happen to him over the course of the show. The character development feels natural, and the show is better as a whole for it. 
Enjoyment: (10/10)
Steins;Gate is one of the few anime I've ever watched that I would give a 10 to overall. It only has a few minor problems, but the overall package is so amazing that they can be easily overlooked. It may take a while to get going, but once it does you won't want to stop watching until you've seen the incredible story through to the end. Somewhat ironically, at then end you'll likely be left wishing you could go back in time to experience the story for the first time again. Watch. This. Anime.",10

                ‚ÄúNo one knows what the future holds. That‚Äôs why its potential is infinite.‚Äù
Okabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)
I've had my fair share of paradoxical movies and anime which range from Interstellar, which was fantastic by the way, Mirai Nikki, Looper, Primer and Madoka e.t.c.. I am a sucker for this type of genre so bear with me as I might be a little biased here. Also in this review I'll try not to spoil too much of the plot.
What is Steins;Gate about?
If you would give me the liberty to simplify the entire anime into a single concept, then this anime would be about ""Time Travel"".
Story/Plot:9/10
The story is a little slow to begin with but once it hits the ground it runs and it doesn't stop until it hits a wall. However, the slow start is there to build up the setting and get the characters familiarized with the area and there are areas where you have to pay very close attention or you will miss something. Of course, albeit I didn't notice any of the importances in the start of the anime. FEAR NOT, in the later episodes they will reiterate those points to you and you will have the mind blowing of your life. Also since this anime is about time travel each supposed ""Time"" would be different. I feel that quite a few animes brush through the different ""Timeline"" the main characters are in, but in Steins;Gate it really focuses on the changes and makes sure that the audience can see those changes in the new Timeline.
TL;DR - This anime is amazing and on top of that the protagonist is trying to save his childhood friend and realizes his love for Ms.Tsundere and tries to save her too.
Characters:9/10
Okabe: Protagonist and pretty much the odd ball but his character development throughout the anime is very abrupt and quick but not in a bad way. Compared to that of the start of the anime he will become a lot more mellow and matured out. (Hint. SHIT GOES DOWN IN THE ANIME. Shameless promotion)
Makise (a.k.a. Ms.Tsundere): The female protagonist and my anime crush. She's smart and most of the time, calm and collected. Her character does stay relatively the same throughout the anime but its quite nice to see her also develop feelings for Okabe.
Shiina: She is the airhead of the anime and the MOE factor for this anime. She is the anchor to Okabe and thinks dearly of everyone in the ""science club"". Also she will be the driving point of the plot for about 75% for the anime so be prepared for a lot of Moe Moe.
Hashida (a..k.a. DARU): The perv of the anime and also loves to tease and make fun of Ms.Tsundere and Shiina. He is the computer whiz of this ""science club"" and i suppose is the generic look for a hacker? His character stays the same as well throughout the anime, so not much to say about his development as a character.
Kiryu: She is quite and very shy character. However don't let that persona fool you as something will happen later in the anime. So you better watch it and find out what happens or you can just read something on the wiki and ruin it for yourself, your call.
Urushibara: A possible transgender as HE wishes to be a SHE. HE was brought up in a shrine wearing lots of girly clothing which my have been a factor to why he wants to be a female. HE isn't big in the driving of the plot BUT throughout the timeline jumps that OKABE and discovers something rather peculiar.
Amane: I will just say that she is like a wild card. You didn't know the producer had this sort of card and when he puts it down to the playing field you kind of lose your shit and I love it. It a little hard to believe at first but its great to see unique character that comes in around halfway to add more flair to the anime.
Settings:9/10
The setting is quite small so and you could say that the fact that they have a small setting doesn't necessarily mean that the anime is less interesting. The fact that Hamasaki and Sato (directors of the anime) managed to utilize this small setting and make wonders out of it. The small setting also means that you are somewhat familiar with the area and this is quite good since this anime is about TIME TRAVEL when there are changes to the SETTING you will realize it without the anime having it to spoon feed it to you. WIN-WIN all across the board.
Music:8/10
The SFX and the background music isn't as epic as Guilty Crown or Code Geass, but for its genre I think it fit quite well. The intention of making something mysterious but at the same time have purpose. It was great to see that from Takeshi Abo (also a really great musician). 
Animation: 8/10
The animation is crisp and nice but it it quite the generic animation style so there isn't much I can do to describe with words to give it justice but I can say that the animation did not bother me at all and I didn't really notice anything special about it.
Overall I think that this is a great anime. If you enjoyed animes such as Madoka and Mirai Nikki I really recommend giving this a go. In the end this anime got an outstanding 9/10 from me.
I forgot to add this before I left, if you didn't find it helpful it would be nice to know why it wasn't and since it was my first review I thought some pointers from veterans would be nice. :)

                I don't think I would have bothered writing a review for Steins Gate if it wasn't ranked #2 on Myanimelist. Then again, I don't think I would have continued watching this anime after Episode 5 if it hadn't been ranked that high by almost everybody, including some friends.
I'll give the main reason for me not liking Steins Gate as much as everyone else right away: the first half of it bored me to hell, then it became slightly better while the last four episodes were quite watchable. Now for some more details.
Story/Characters - The Story itself, its basic idea is not bad. A young, self-proclaimed,
                  back-alley scientist inventing a time machine by accident and messing around with it, not thinking about the bigger consequences. As that might not enough, putting in an organisation that's after his invention is an understandable plot device. However, the execution of that premise is pretty poor. 
As far as I understood the intention of the people behind this series, the first half of it tried to make the viewer develop a strong connection with the characters. That brings us right to the problems I had with them: While the main character, Hououin Kyouma (as he calls himself) is surely unique, I found him to be little more than an annoying dick. He doesn't seem to have any skills except making up wild conspiracies and weird names for his experiments as well as doing everything to alienate the people around him. More worrying for a scientist is that he also doesn't seem to have much scientific knowledge, all that work is done by other characters. So the invention of the time machine seems already pretty implausible. I also didn't fully understand why everybody seemed to put up with his character, except for his childhood friend with whom he had a long-lasting relation maybe.
All the other characters were - in my opinion - nothing more than stereotypes that added no value whatsoever. Watch the series and you'll probably understand me. The only positive thing for me was that Hououins annoying character traits mostly vanish in the second half of the series when he has to make tough decisions and playing time is over. Unfortunately the doesn't get any more interesting.
Back to the story: I felt like many ideas were thrown in, executed poorly or not at all and quickly discarded. While some might love to discuss what the genius creators were thinking when putting that in, my opinion is that in most cases they were just lazy and that there is no sense in ascribing meaning to the resulting plotholes. Then again, they at least managed to wrap up the story in a satisfactory way. Though, to reach this conclusion you'll have to put up with tons of random, unimportant dialogue and aimless conversation. I also missed the sort of ""mindfuck"" experience some time travel stories give you, though that may have been my fault for getting my expectations too high.
While this part of my review might seem a bit bland and I'd love to go into more detail it's hard to do that without requiring the reader to have watched the series ore spoiling the story for others who still want to watch it (though I can't really recommend to do so).
Sound - I'll keep this short and simple. Opening was fantastic though they kept it for all the 24 episodes which is unusual. As it was really good, I didn't mind. Background music was okay, I guess, I really can't remember any of it but it also seemed to fit the whole series while watching it. Voice actors? Also okay, I guess, though Hououin Kyouma really stood in a good way. Also, Mayuris ""Tuturu"" will really get stuck in your head for quite a while :D Look it up on youtube and you'll know what I mean.
Art - Over the whole series the art style is pretty dark and devoid of much color. It fits the sometimes dark atmosphere though the series fails to establish that atmosphere all the time. So I found myself pretty annoyed by the lack of colors at times, not really being able to tell you why. I liked that kind of art style a lot more in series like Death Note.
The reason I still give this series a 7 is that I started to enjoy it in the end, too bad it was over shortly afterwards. Thinking back about how annoying watching it for was for the most part makes a 7 seem almost too good a score. So for everyone planning to watch Steins Gate: I really can't recommend it, you'll force yourself through the first half and the payoff later isn't big enough to justify that.",7

                Story: 10
10/10 For the story, initially it takes a bit of the time for the story to pick up pace, but once it does, it keeps you thoroughly entertained. There is a nice and slow buildup, a great plot twist in the middle and a superb ending that makes this anime one of the best in recent memory
Sound :8
The sound was well orchestrated depending on the mood of the scenes, but besides providing a good base, it doesn't really stand out. It doesn't make the scenes feel bette,r but neither does it make it worse. So the music gets a 6/10 in my book.
As for
                  the voice acting, it was superb.The voice actors for Okabe, Makise and Mayuri in particular really gave a lot of feeling to their characters, so a 10/10 for me.
Considering both music and voice acting, sound gets an 8/10
Character: 10
All of the characters were fleshed out well enough for us to genuinely care about them. The slow start to the series certainly helped to focus more on the characters and less on the plot and as a result the characters all seem real rather than just generic anime characters. 
Enjoyment: I enjoyed every second of it and is easily one of my top 5 anime.10/10 and a must watch in my book.",9

                Before you read this it is probably worth mentioning that, if you couldn't figure our via my ratings, I REALLY LIKE STEINS;GATE.  It is not only my favorite anime of all time, not only my favorite just TV show in general, but it is MY FAVORITE THING I'VE EVER SEEN EVER.
Its highest point, which you might know if you've ever heard anything about Steins;Gate, is its characters,  its dialouge coming up a close second.
Okabe Rintarou is a lot--though not really TONS--like me in that we're both just ridiculously huge dweebs and speak with big words, so I can relate to him. (This is
                  the only anime I have seen hitherto that I would acually recommend seeing the English Dub as well as the Japanese; the English version beefs up Okabe's dialouge and acutually makes things flow kinda different).
Kurisu, though indeed a Tsundere, is not a tired and trite one and, through her relatively dark past, also proves to be interesting.
By the way, Mikase Kirisu is best girl and currently holds the grand high privelage of my waifu.
I suppose others might find this show kind of boring and they also might find Okabe to be a bit much sometimes and I suppose they ALSO might find the plot a tinge hard to follow (though if you've ever seen Doctor Who and liked it it shouldn't be too hard) but complex though it is, it is really quite clever and is interesting, with a realy good blend of action, suspense, romance, comedy, slice-of-lifeness, and some awesome ""feels""-y bits.
I highly, HIGHLY recommend watching this.  And also the Movie, the OVA, and the specials; they are all top-notch as well.",10
"
                This show is one of the highest rated anime on MAL and rightfully so. This show screams perfection in all ways. The art, music, characters, and most of all story make this one of my favourite anime's of all time.
I love story lines that keep we guessing what will happen next. I especially love when these guesses are wrong, this is something that this show pulls off almost every episode. The story takes a little time to get into or even understand the basics. Don't be surprised when you watch the first episode and nothing makes any sense at all, this is intentional. This beginning
                  only strengthens the triumphant conclusion which, to me, is watching the first episode over again after completing the series and understanding EVERYTHING. The story of Steins;Gate is a masterpiece that can, and will, only be experienced by watching the show.
Strangely enough even after watching plenty of anime (I haven't seen anywhere close to as many as some other users) I don't feel like I have ever seen characters like the ones in Steins;Gate before. Each character feels fresh to me and this is something that other series can't even dream of saying about their characters. Because each of them are unique and have an interesting story, none of the characters feels forced in as a plot device.
Sound and visuals are nothing amazing, but I just couldn't skip the intro song when loading up the next slice of the story. Calling both the graphics and audio nothing amazing isn't meant to be a discredit to this anime at all. They are both very well done and fit the show perfectly but they are not game changers.
Steins;Gate is an anime that you almost need to watch if you are interested in anything current in the popular anime space. You will keep thinking about this series for a couple weeks after finishing and smile to yourself because it was just so damn good. I tell anyone who hasn't seen much anime but is interested in more and even seasoned vets who have seen every genre under the sun to watch this show. I extended to you the same recommendation to you.
The English dub of the show is awesome if you aren't interested in subs, but I prefer the sub due to some English being thrown into the Japanese speech that will give anyone who can understand burst out laughing.

That was the special guest interview! Now, on to the real review.
__________________________________________________________________________
Steins;Gate is mainly Japan's take on time travel.
After the successful shows and movies such as Doctor Who and Butterfly Effect in the West, Japan decided to try too, so in 2009 Nitroplus collaborated with 5pb. to develop Steins;Gate, a Sci-Fi Thriller visual novel, that is about unique time travel methods.
After that, came the inevitable anime adaptation in 2011, a special anime episode is set to be released in 2012 and an anime movie adaptation is set to be released, but the release date of the movie is still unknown for now.
Story: 10
Steins;Gate starts very confusing. The first episode turned away many watchers who dropped it because of the confusion. After the first episode, the series picks up and turns into an emotional rollercoaster of sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes tragic and sometimes thrilling events.
The first half of the anime is lighthearted and shrouded in mystery. It is an omen to the things to come in the second half.
The story first kicks when myself, Kurisu, and Okabe interact.
After Okabe witnesses something terrible that happened to me (I don't want to spoil what exactly for those who still haven't watched the anime), he is surprised to see these turns of events undone.
From there, start the most thrilling 3 weeks in our life...
Art and Animation: 9
While the art in the anime has been changed from the visual novel that was done by Huke (Black Rock Shooter art etc), it is fluid and grim. Ofcourse, there are many animation errors and 'Quality', but they do not hinder the enjoyment from the anime, alas the almost perfect score in art and animations.
The animation in the Opening and Ending sequences is simply amazing, but the animation in the anime itself is not as good mainly because of budget problems.
Sound: 10
I consider Hacking to the Gate to be one of my best favorite J-pop songs ever made, if not one of my best favorite songs ever. The ending song is also pretty good, and a few soundtracks from the visual novel appear in the anime too. Itou Kanako KYAA~
I also consider the voice acting to be even more amazing than the visual novel. Not to brag ofcourse, but I l-l-like my own voice so... Hehe~
Character:10
Okabe -  I don't know much about him, but he's a good guy. Very perverted though. Calls himself a Mad Scientist, show syndromes of Chuunibyou, but when it counts he always treasures his friends.
Hashida-san -  Perverted gentleman and supa hacka- I mean hacker. He and Okabe are the perverted combo.
Mayuri-chan-  A cheerful girl. Younger than most of us. Her favorite word is ""Tuturu~"".
Urushibara-san-  I thought she was one of the most beautiful girls I ever saw, until I realized the truth... it's a tra-
Akiha Rumiho - The queen of 	Akihabara.
Amane Suzuha- very sporty. Has her own share of deep secrets.
Kiryuu Moeka- quiet and tall girl, likes to use her cellphone to communicate. Okabe gave her the nickname ""Shining finger"" because of the speed she types in her cellphone. Then I read the visual novel and watched the anime and the truth about her was exposed... everything shattered into pieces.
Tennouji Nae- Seems cute and innocent, treasures her dad. Then I read the visual novel and the truth about her was exposed... everything shattered into pieces.
Tennouji Yuugo - Nickname: Mr.Brown. A pretty nice guy. Then I read the visual novel and watched the anime and the truth about him was exposed... everything shattered into pieces.
Enjoyment: 10
Very ENJOYABLE! Hehe~
Overall: 10
Makise Kurisu reports in. I was here. Now everyone, go read the manga adaptations, watch the anime adaptation, wait for the special anime episode and the and the anime movie and read the almost translated and edited visual novel (Release date to be expected in Christmas or early 2012).
Sayonara~! And Merry Kurisumasu to everyone again!",10

                Ever since the year 2010 or 2011, the time travel concept in both TV shows and movies has been overused to the max. Half of them failing due to how it's written and the weak execution. However, Steins;Gate is not one of them. It is currently the best time travel show I have ever seen in my entire life. I could watch this in the year 2036 and I would still have the same enjoyment I got when I first watched this show. 
[Story]: (10/10)
Okabe Rintarou is the founder of a small lab named ""Future Gadget Laboratory"" where he invents a bunch of ""Future Gadgets"".
                  His hacker friend and his childhood friend are also members of the FGL. After an incident, he found out that one of his inventions can send messages through time.   
Back when I was a hater of anime, my friend tried to get me into anime by recommending me a few animes that he thought I might like. Steins;Gate was one of them. I completely dismissed the show and a year later, which is today, I decided to watch the show on Netflix in English Dub. After watching a couple of episodes, I was completely hooked to this show..
Some or most people might think that Ep. 1-8 was boring due to the slow pacing but in my opinion, it wasn't. It's a rarity in a time travel show to explain how time travel really works and that's mostly what the first 8 episodes did. It introduced and explained some theories about time travel that felt almost real..I mean, it isn't just some theory that felt like it was made up. There was scientific backing and explanations behind time travel. For example, the show abolished the idea of ""Time Paradox"" (which is the biggest pain-in-the-ass plot point that you have to deal with in a time travel show) and brought up another theory called the ""Parallel World"" theory, meaning that there are infinite world lines as opposed to a single world line.  There's also the ""Butterfly Effect"", where if you meet your past-self or try to change the past, it will create another world line with different future instead of changing the current world line's future. However, this isn't the first time a show has used the ""Parallel World""/""Butterfly Effect"" theory. It's just not common for a time travel show to use this theory instead of the Time Paradox theory. Later on, more theories are also introduced that you will need to understand how time travelling really works. In my opinion, the explanation and reasoning behind time travel was very well done. 
I'm glad the first half of the show was slow paced because they took their time explaining the time travel theories and ideas and they also took their time introducing the characters and their personalities. Basically, what you should expect from them and to give me a reason why I should care for the characters should tragedy strikes upon them. 
The creators did a great job showing the viewers that time travel is not a ""toy"" that you should play with (which happened in the 2nd half).. Sure, it's fun travelling through time. Maybe change the outcome of WW2 or prevent 9/11 from happening BUT there will be consequences for playing with a dangerous ""toy"". For example, by changing the outcome of WW2, all of us would probably be Aryans by now  or by preventing 9/11 from happening, the US would probably have a 2nd Civil War or the Southerners will legalize incest...Oh wait, those Southerners can already fuck their own siblings/parents.......Anyways, I can use those examples for this show..Fun at first then everything bites you in the ass later. The first half has a lighthearted atmosphere and Okabe would just change time without the consequences. In the 2nd half however, shit starts to get serious. Everything that he did in the first half has now bitten him back in his ass. I won't reveal what happened in the 2nd half but all I will say is..it is the best the show has to offer. If you think the first half was boring then the 2nd half will completely surprise you.
The following points that I want to talk about are the dialogue scenes, the perfect plot twists and the amount of fanservice. Firstly, The dialogue scenes in the series are just...ohhh..so engaging. Whenever a show explains boring stuff like science calculations and sh*t, I usually just fall asleep but here, that didn't happen..at all!. Maybe because they didn't entirely focus on one boring endless dialogues after another. They also focused on the character interactions which made the show pretty funny..on the first half, at least. Secondly, the unpredictable and perfect plot twists that this show has. Every.Single.Time a plot twists occurs, it leaves me in awe, my hand covering my mouth due to how shocked I was and an ending theme playing in the background and it was hard for me to close the episode. That's how unpredictable they were. Last but not least is the amount of fanservice in the show. Are there a lot? not a lot? non-existent? This is all I will answer. I was able to watch this show on the living room and I was able to watch this show with my door open. I hope that answers your question. 
So to summarize..Why do I love this show so much? It's the perfectly executed and well written time travel concept. As a time-travel fan and geek, I had no choice but to love this show. The story is so well written that finding a flaw in the series is simply impossible. I lied, there are a few flaws in the series but the show was so great that they can simply be ignored. The flaws weren't even that big. The story was written by a smart nerdy guy who majored in Science and is probably a friend of Albert Einstein, that's all. 
______________________________________________________________
[Art/Animation]: (9.5/10)
Look, I'm a big fanboy of the show right now but the animation of Steins;Gate is not oustanding. ufotable and KyoAni's animation, now that's what you call perfect. While the animation may not be perfect, it is pretty damn great. For the most part, the animation is smooth and consistent but there were scenes where they would show a still frame with white lines on the top and bottom side or no white lines at all and it's just still frame for at least 2 sec. It bothered me a couple of times but it really wasn't a major issue that happened throughout the show. The character designs are great, Mayushi having the best character design, in my opinion. I also want to mention Kurisu and the way she wears her jacket. Why is she wearing it like that and how does she keep it in place? 
______________________________________________________________
[Sound]: (9/10)
I personally want to go to Japan right now and congratulate the people who's responsible for composing the great and awesome OST. It is currently one of the best OSTs I have ever heard and it just fits so well, especially the dramatic scenes. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)
The OP theme song is ""Hacking to the Gate"" by Kanako Itou and the ED theme songs are ""Toki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku"" by Yui Sakakibara, ""Fake Verthandi"" by Takeshi Abo, ""Sky Clad no Kansokusha"" by Kanako Itou  and ""Another Heaven"" by Kanako Itou. The OP theme song is good, no doubt about it..The problem for me is the song got annoying by the 2nd half. The song just didn't fit my taste, that's all. Out of all the ED theme songs, the first one stood out for me. The atmosphere of the song is just great and I personally liked the use of strong beats. The staff did an outstanding job using the ED theme song on the episode 9 so effectively. A plot twist occurred in episode 9 and when the ED theme song played, it gave me heavy goosebumps. 
I watched the show in English Dub so I'll be reviewing the English VA (Voice Actors). Honestly, this is one of those shows where if you watch the English Dub version first, it will be very hard to switch to the Japanese voice if you're going to re-watch the series...You know, just like ""The Melancholy/Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya"". I tried re-watching that show in subs and I just couldn't handle the Japanese VA of Kyon compared to the English VA of Kyon which was voiced by Crispin Freeman. It's mostly the same case here..I couldn't handle the Japanese VA of Okabe at first after hearing the English VA of Okabe. His Japanese voice sounds too deep and I never heard a white person here in the West with a voice that deep. That doesn't mean I hate his Japanese voice though. In fact, I got used to his Japanese voice, it just took a while. Mayuri's ""Tuturu"" sound in both versions are just as equally as annoying (and cute) and I kinda prefer the Japanese VA of Mayuri compared to the English VA of Mayuri but that doesn't mean I hate her English VA. She sounds just as cute as the Japanese VA. 
______________________________________________________________
[Characters]: (10/10)
The main characters are just outstanding..Every single one of them has a likable personality, even though one of the main character's personality is very cliche. I'm talking about Christina *ahem* I mean, Makise Kurisu. She's a full blown Tsundere..A tsundere character that is better in every conceivable way than a regular tsundere that you mainly see in anime these days. Every single characters in the show are developed, even the side characters. You'll learn their past, who they are, and etc.. It's like they're treated like a main character. It felt like they were important to the story, even though they're just a side character. For example, Suzuha is a side character but due to the amount of development and screentime that she got, I thought she was a main character. She's also someone that you need to watch out for. On the other hand, the amount of changes that you'll see in the main characters as the show moves on are pretty notable. Well, time to give my opinions on the main characters and some of the side characters. 
Okabe Rintarou or ""Hououin Kyouma"" is the main protagonist of the series..He is a crazy mad scientist and he's the founder of the Future Gadget Lab. I.Fucking.Love his speeches. It's hilarious..I usually don't like scientists. Not just in anime but also in Western TV Shows/movies but he's one of the few scientists that I adore. Then there's Member 002 Mayuri Shiina. She and Okabe are childhood friends and she's also Okabe's ""hostage"". She's one of the nicest, kindest, most innocent girl I have ever seen and her ""Tuturu"" sound is both annoying and cute at the same...Also infectious because my little sister has been annoying me with that phrase for the past week or so. Then there's Member 003 Daru. Wow, I haven't seen a fat anime character in a while. 99% of anime male characters these days have perfect bodies with 6-pack abs. Nice to see someone refreshing for a change. While his otaku side is hilarious, it's also kind of disturbing and too pervertish. Then there's Member 004 Makise Kurisu. One of, if not, the best tsundere character I've ever seen. Hell, even Okabe and Daru calls her a tsundere. 
This is the final one and I'm going to skip to Member 006 Ruka Urushibara. 
""Delicate as an orchid, fair as a cheery blossom -- the personification of a feminine grace and...a dude. Tall as a willow, slender as a reed..a dude. Radiant and shrined vestments..A dude. The sun dips slow in a rosy sky, Cicada's buzz. Ruka is definitely....a dude"". 
You heard that right, Ruka is a guy. The trap here is just insane. If Okabe didn't have that monologue, there is no way in Satan's glory I would have ever known that Ruka......is a dude. Ugh, boner....not now. Can you blame me? He's just too hot *Ahem*...Ignore what I just said. 
______________________________________________________________
[Enjoyment]: (10/10)
I definitely enjoyed this series...Like really, I did. I'm a bit cautious when picking a 2-cour series because half of those series tend to get boring by the 2nd half or it's just downright boring for like 24 episodes straight.I never once felt bored when I watched Steins;Gate. Not even the first half of the series..Most of the time, the cliffhangers would work perfectly and I would end up marathon-ing 4-6 episodes.  
______________________________________________________________
[VERDICT]
""Steins;Gate"" is an outstanding masterpiece of a show and it definitely deserves the number 2 spot on the MAL. To this day, I still have no idea why some users think that Steins;Gate doesn't deserve that spot but whatever. If you're a fan of Science Fiction then you will love this show. If you're a fan of Time Travel then you will DEFINITELY love this show, for sure. It's sad to see an anime end with such a well-written story. There's still the movie that I have to watch and ""Steins;Gate Zero"" which I will definitely look forward to. Wow, I didn't mean to write a long review for this series. I just had so much fun writing a review on one of my favourite series of all time. Time to end my review..El Psy Congroo!

                Steins;Gate, a science fiction anime that contains this well thought out mind blowing storyline, equipped with an auric setting, fluid plot development, characters with unique persona and amazing voice-actors, and the sheer amount of plot-twisting revelations to look out for in every scenario that results me as a viewer, after watching an episode ending up at the edge of my seat staring at my screen craving for more. Not an exaggeration.
The premise is always well explained in the show with the use of actual facts and scientific theory in real life, an awe of inspirational scientific thinking to the point you'd start brainstorming your mind
                  for answers pertaining to the topics, and the characters that are so unique and friendly that it's just fun watching them do their own thing and hang out in their place. ^w^
The scores that i gave to this anime series is overall my judgment and opinion of it, just want to point that out since this is my 1st review. 
Story and character are scored 10, that's a given, I wouldn't elaborate into it more to avoid potential spoilers but it's pretty much the main pillar that constitutes this whole show.
Sound is a 9, i'd like to give it a perfect score if the music included more of those from the visual novel, there are a few but i felt like it lacked a little, still a very high score since the music is pretty rad.
And the reason i gave the art an 8. the lowest score possible compared to the other categories is that the animation of the show might be kinda mosaic in a sense that the gray tone of the outline might not be as colorfully inviting as most anime that you and i might've watched, and it might put off some viewers and immediately consider it as boring or something..? But i assure you, there's nothing as boring as a rollercoaster of events constantly going up and down tracking on a long emotional road that i have witnessed in this, well, time-space continuum ordeal. Go and watch it, it's gonna be one hell of a ride! :D",10

                Before I start writing this review there a few things i must state:
If you like fast paced anime then this anime is probably not for you. Steins Gate takes around 7-8 episodes just to develop the characters. It does this to such an extent that you would think that Steins Gate is a slice of life anime rather than a time travel drama.
But if you bother to wait until the action starts your going to be in for an epic ride of awesomeness.
Steins Gate revolves around self proclaimed MAD SCIENTIST Okabe Rintarou a.k.a Hououin Kyouma. He is the founder of Future Gadget Club and he
                  is the lab member 001.
In the beginning of the show your not really sure if Okabe's personality is of a MAD SCIENTIST or if he has an actual personality. But fortunately he does develop a lot during the show and i grantee that you will love his alter ego of Hououin Kyouma.
Plot:
I won't talk much about the plot as i do not want to give any major spoilers, but instead i will give a quick synopsis.
Basically the story starts with Okabe going to a science conference where he sees Makise Kurisu being stabbed.As he goes to text about her death he sends a text backwards in time changing the course of events......
Let's Just say that i won't continue to not give any spoilers.
Anyway in conclusion if you love time travel stories and if you want an masterpiece of an anime that has an almost flawless plot I recommended Stein Gate to you
Overall Rating 10/10",10

                It's not easy to write a story about time travel. Everything that is possible to do in relation to that plot element has been done to death, usually with some incredibly poor execution and incredibly strange plot devices. The latter isn't necessarily a bad thing, but people have gotten absolutely fed up of time travel related stories trying to do something different and failing miserably.
This is simply a case of people being fed up of something trying too hard and failing miserably every single time. Sure, there are cases where time travel stories work, but those tend to focus on the adventure behind travelling through
                  time rather than the actual time travel, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I mean, wanting to write an adventure involving what the future looks like, potential alternate versions of someone and using quantum physics to explain time travel (The latter in particular seems to be really common nowadays for some reason) is pretty normal and hell, even expected of time travel stories.
Steins;Gate doesn't try to avert anything that has been done elsewhere; it falls into a lot of the cliches that plague time travel stories, and makes no attempt whatsoever at disguising this. What does work, however, is how well this works to the show's advantage.
The concepts behind the actual time travel in the show are explained in a ridiculous amount of detail and depth, and is very refreshing to say the least. The storyline is incredibly well thought out, with hints and foreshadowing all over the show yet never making it too obvious about what it is doing or where the storyline will go.
Since this show does have a ridiculous amount of aspects that make no sense the first time watching it, a lot of it makes more sense on a rewatch, making it get better the more I rewatch it. This is enhanced greatly by the number of plot elements and scenes that are largely left up to interpretation by the viewer, as the show excels at showing the story rather than telling it and does not attempt at holding your hand, especially in the second half of the show.
The characters are well-fleshed out from start to finish, despite falling into various archetypes at the beginning of the show. There are plot elements that help see different sides to the characters, and none of them are simplistic or one-note. The interactions between the various characters feel both natural and human, not to mention extremely humorous over the course of the show, and this is enhanced by the tone of the show being very consistent when being dramatic, happy go lucky or tragic.
The artwork and animation quality are stellar and there is a lot of eye candy to see over the course of the show. The background art is visually stunning, and I have screenshots on my computer which I have used as my wallpaper several times. The movements are very smooth and the character designs compliment the mood of the show as well as the various characters extremely well, which never once feels immersion breaking or inconsistent.
Steins;Gate is an extremely enjoyable and well-written show, and I honestly cannot recommend it highly enough. The storyline is tightly written, the animation and artwork are gorgeous and the concepts are nothing special but work extremely well here. Okabe and Kurisu's interactions in particular were a joy to watch, and this show is everything I can look for in a time travel story done extremely well.
If you haven't seen it, watch it.",10

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
‚ÄúNo one knows what the future holds. That is why its potential is infinite.‚Äù The topic of time travel has been around since 1900s, often sparking heated debates about whether it is possible, or just a makeshift idea of some creative guy, to this day, the question remains unanswered. Steins; Gate offers a nice twist on the time travel, Sc-Fi genre by not exploring the process of the time travel itself, but its possibilities and the doom, chaos and suffering it brings to the one that chooses to travel through time, to conquer it. 
The premise of the story is simple: Okabe
                  Rintaro, self-proclaimed ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù and his fellow lab members make a time machine, eventually leveling it up to the point of being able to time leap a real human being. The story takes a roller coaster ride to the depths of the human mind and what time travel really does to a human after Okabe tries to go back in time to save the death of his dearest friend, Mayuri. While the saving of Mayuri may not sound complicated, the persona of John Titor, a sort of a time travelling guide, gives the audience the impression that Mayuri cannot be saved and that the creation of the time machine itself was the reason for her death. 
‚ÄúYou must not change the past, once its been established.‚Äù- Okabe Rintaro. The beloved mad scientist, Okabe Rintaro a character that shows what determination, selflessness, but also madness can achieve, a man who has singlehandedly conquered time and changed fate, one who came down from an endless spiral of darkness and despair. Okabe gets challenged many times through Steins; Gate and does exactly what the plot needs to move forward, he is a determined, likeable, funny character that constantly gets made fun of in classical anime fashion, making Steins; Gate a bit more predictable than it needed to be, seeing our hero Okabe fight against the world immediately gave the impression that the ending will be happy, that the conclusion will be a favorable one for all of the characters. He is the shows biggest pro and con. He is there to show the flawed logic of time travel; the ability to travel, but not to change. His struggles prove meaningless many times showing the reality of this world, the true choice of the Steins; Gate, the inability for one man to change fate, his minor role in the grand scheme of things. Okabe, being mentally and emotionally tired, tries to change it, but is proven wrong again and again, the only real answer to his struggle being to return to the original timeline, killing his friend, later partner, Makise Kurisu. While presented with a choice of choosing one: Mayuri or Makise, he needs to have someone else choose, Okabe feels tired of all his struggles, all of the things he has tried, all of the methods that did not work, he wants it all to stop. 
The shows main appeal is its cast of characters, a colorful, but twisted bunch all of whom have side they don‚Äôt want anyone to see. Whether it is Braun being FB, Suzu being a time traveler, each character feels like a puzzle that is solved step by step while their fate intertwines with Okabe‚Äôs, slowly increasing their bond with him.  While most of the cast is very shallowly characterized, there is something to enjoy and relate to in each single one of them, making it feel like you are part of the lab, that you are making the machine. The dynamics between characters were done great for the most part, with Feyris‚Äô and Okabe‚Äôs being the best. Both have a shallow mind that is covered by their over-the-top persona, one of them acts selflessly, the other selfishly.  
While the concept itself is explained very deeply and thoroughly, many of the basic questions remain unanswered as the show tends to shy away from explaining most of its processes and reasonings, the anime loses a bit of its credibility the later it goes on, its theories seeming less possible and realistic as it nears its climax. 
The biggest problem of the narrative is the classic anime emotion vs logic type of battle, unfortunately, the emotion side tends to prevail in Steins; Gate, making the conclusion seem predictable and underwhelming, the character interactions turning from a heavily thought out, enjoyable dialogue to a simple, boring melodrama with most of the female cast having feelings or relations with, towards Okabe near the end. 
Steins; Gate is a monotone, boring looking show, but that is not a bad thing. With the, mostly gray and white, color palette, it feels like the whole series is a loop, that it all is the same, old, boring and monotone reality that we all are in, that we will never get out of. 
The opening and ending were fantastic. The opening in particular is full of symbolism and foreshadowing that the viewer notices as they get deeper into the show. All of its mysteries are truly revealed after watching the series fully, it remains a mystery even as the final episode rolls. 
With all of its flaws, inconsistencies and unexplained questions, I enjoyed the series nonetheless, it was a thrilling ride and a breath of fresh air in the really stale and monotone Sc-Fi genre. It is a revolutionay anime and one that set the bar really high for upcoming Sc-Fi titles and proved that a time travel anime can be done right, that it can be possible to make a ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù topic accessible to the mainstream. Steins; Gate is a classic and a must watch for any old and new anime fan.",7

                Many people consider this anime as a masterpiece for the wrong reasons. I'm gonna start this review with the positve aspects of the show and then with the negative to conclued why I consider this one as an absolute mediocrity:
Positive aspects:
1) The animation and sountrack are good.
2) The slow pacing is appropriate for the topics that the show try to present.
3) The show makes a good job anticipating the biggest plot twists.
4) The main duo are well constructed and developed during the show.
Negative aspects:
1) The secondary characters are irrelevant and are just comic reliefs or plot devices.
2) The time travel logic is retarded. According to
                  the butterfly effect (theory that many fans praises because it is part of the anime's plot), little changes can cause big consequences, however, the show uses this topic in a very convenient way. For example, making that a male change his sex to female for telling the mother that she should eat more vegetables in the past already sounds retarded, but the worst part is that the show present this as the only change in the world for this time travel, making a contradiction with the theory that the show claims to have. The limitations and rules of the time travel were never explained, so, there are a lot of plot holes and conveniences for that reason.
3) A lot of pretentiousness. For example, the show focus on say that the characters are super smart and a genius, however, they make a very stupid decisions and the issues that they solved were because of it. The show tries to create tension and drama, and fails because of the retarded and convenient logic of the time travels and the archetypical and one-dimensional secondary characters involved that were the focus of the problems most of the cases.
4) The ending. Why the show focused on develop the main duo if they are gonna make a time-reset ending that nullifies all of this. 
In conclusion, the anime is praised for the worst aspects of the same and it should have stayed as a scientific comedy. It could have been better in this way.",5
"
                This anime is such a beautiful piece of art. The characters, stories and personalities are constant throughout the anime, and each one has a shroud of mystery to them. The time travel works beautifully with this, and this anime is so far the only one I've seen that works extremely well. I recommend highly to anyone into sci-fi mystery anime, and to any at all.

                Let's just say I went into Steins;Gate ready to bash it for the typical pitfalls of hyped anime: cliched characters, action sequences for no apparent reason, and lack of ambition. So what did I think after watching 24 episodes of time travel goodness? Well, as a certain mad scientist would say, ""It's so cool, (sonuvabitch)!"" Yet, no matter how much I liked the series as a whole, I felt like something was missing. It just didn't have the same personal/emotional impact on me as other shows did, though I enjoyed it nonetheless.
Story: 9
Steins;Gate is a story about a self-proclaimed ""mad scientist"" named Okabe Rintarou, who
                  has recently become interested in building a time machine. To his surprise, the machine he built works, though he has no idea HOW it works or what the implications of this might be. Right off the bat, the story grabs your attention with its unique setting. And while the idea of time travel has been done in many anime/manga before, Steins;Gate is one of the few that incorporates actual theories on the mechanics in a way that a regular person (like me) could understand. However, the series is not all technical. It can be funny when it wants to be, or it can be emotional and heart-wrenching. Either way, amazing dialogue and plot twists make this a very enjoyable watch.
Art: 10
The art direction is very fascinating. You only need to look at the opening to see the cleanness and creativity of the art in Steins;Gate. Black-and-white frames are expressive and used appropriately. Items like clocks and hourglasses are drawn especially well. Also, the character designs are unique and pleasant to look at.
Sound: 10
Again, I never felt like the music was out-of-place. It was always suitable for the occasion, whether it was trying to be serious or funny. Special mention goes to the opening theme ""Hacking to the Gate"", which I enjoyed quite a bit.
Character: 9
Overall, a solid cast of characters. While it had certain cliches (tsundere, genki girl, perverted nerd), it never held itself to them, providing backstory and exposition when necessary. My only complaint is that, with the exception of our main cast, the characters' personalities are rather dull. For example, I was hoping that one of the show's major antagonists would turn out to be more sympathetic than she actually was. I love it when a show has a villain that you can both love and hate, but it feels like Steins;Gate only included that character for the audience to vent out our frustrations. The ""punch scene"" (if you watch the series, you'll understand) was funny, yet I couldn't get over the fact that they made her act like an ""evil brat"" when she could have been much, much more.
Enjoyment/Overall: 9
I enjoyed this series a lot more than I was expecting to. It struck a good balance between comedy and drama, not to mention the immense production value. I would definitely recommend this series to anyone willing to give it a try.",9
"
When I first started to watch Steins gate, I almost dropped it after 2 - 3 episodes. It has extremely confusing start and for most of the people who are used to constant action even boring. But believe me, these episodes are there for a reason, oh yes. This anime starts incredibly sweet, relaxed and features insignificant problems of characters like broken television, paying rent, realitionship between characters. But everything changes when they accidentally invent a time machine. Suddenly the genre of show twist to survival horror and hardcore mind fuck. 
It doesn't happen often I give Anime ratings 10/10 
Story - Masterfully done, especially
                  in the time travel based story. There are no plot holes, no inconsistencies. 
Art - One word ""AMAZING""
Sound - Simply beautiful. Opening, ending even ""battle"" music is simply amazing
Characters - Again incredible. Each character is very well made visually and each has an unexpectedly good story.
Enjoyment - After you watch all episodes you simply must watch it again, that's how enjoyable it is.
Overall - This anime just moved to the number 1 of my animes.  After completing the series you feel like you understand time travel.  This Anime is full of humor, drama, investigation, action, mindfuck, romance. I didnt think anime could be relaxing, full of humor and still be dark and sad. Full of life and still be depressing. To be this depressing and still have such a",10

                This is a spoiler free review so go ahead and read my review, This is my first review so go easy on me whats wrong about reviewing my favorite anime hahaha so anyways....
Story: 10/10
Never has my life changed because of a story but Steins;Gate completely does just that, Holy fuck man.. I was always a fan of time travel shit so I was completely blow away by the end. I recently rewatched Steins;Gate a 3rd time I still got the same fucking reaction I had back then. The story starts of at a slow pace allowing world building, character development and character progression, It starts
                  of with okabe doing his experiments with his fellow lab members, seems fun right? wait a couple of episodes and you will see that every action has consequences, Its just so damn good.
Art: 8/10
I can't say much about the art its not amazing its but it fits really well on the characters and the story.
Sound: 10/10
I absolutely loved the ost of this show liked the Gate of Steiner, Christina, Farewell etc. I listen to some of these in every day life when I am just chillin' reading Manga or something. The use of cicadas are very well done representing the emptiness that okabe feels, Its just so well done. Okabe is Miyano Mamoru's best performance without a doubt beating light its just so genius everyone's seiyuu had a great performance. Steins;Gate has one of the best dialogues I have seen in a show it fits perfectly and its one of the parts that made me fall in love with it.
Character: 10/10
Steins;Gate has my favorite protagonist and heroine in a anime. Okabe or HOUOUIN KYOUMA! is just so enjoyable to watch while he argues with Kurisu, every word he says to Kurisu was so entertaining, it was like I was there watching them argue over and over. Character development and character progression here was very well done, every character had a important role in the story the slow start made watcher realize the characters role into the story, their personality, their connection to okabe and how they fit into the story. Steins;Gate is just so fucking good at executing the characters.
Enjoyment : 10/10
I cannot comprehend how much I love this show, every single scene was gold in my eyes Okabe's exploits, the dialouge completely made up for the slow start of the show, I really really had fun watching this show, Okabe's laugh never gets old 
Overall: 10/10
Steins;Gate is one of the few shows that always ceases to amaze me every time I watch it it never gets old no matter what the everything about this show is the reason why this is my favorite anime, Its just so amazing every moment every scene is planted deep inside my heart, I loved it from start to finish. Thank you if your read this from start to finish too hehe. Hououin Kyouma will never die, now this is the choice of Steins Gate.
Edit: I see people are still pressing the helpful button on this heavily biased review XD 
Thanks a lot though!!
I made this more than a year ago now, wow, time flies fast. Well, in any case, this review sucks ass lmao. I fckn praised the worldbuilding lmfao",10
"
                Hey all. Tis' my first review so bear with me... This'll be short and sweet but I hope it encourages you to watch this. Because if you haven't, then damn, have you been missing out. 
Time. It's a tricky subject. Any story that deeply ties in with the concept of time is either going to be a raging success or an unfortunate flop. In this case, it's without a shade of doubt, the former. 
Science fiction is the main genre, yes... But oh, it's so much more than that. It's the complete package. It's got everything.
Story: 10/10. This is the main selling point of the
                  anime. It is a story that prays on the unsuspecting of a viewer (did I get it right..?) (In which case you may find its rematch value a little low. You MAY.). 
It starts off as something of a plot straight out of science fiction novels. Time travel, blah blah. But the story and the premise that tie in with the time travelling is what really hits home. It ends up becoming so much more than a boring old cliche sci-fi anime. There's no obscure jargon. Everything is clear and sensible, and based on real theories put forth by celebrated scientists. 
You have action, thrills, comedy. There's romance. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and it'll leave you wanting more. Even after the OVA, even after the movie. You'll still want more. Because that's what this gem of an anime will do to you. 
Stick with the anime for the first few episodes, because you may not follow initially, and Okabe's idiosyncrasies will take some getting used to but everything will become clear, and it WILL be worth the wait. Trust me (and everyone else who voted Steins;Gate to #2 on MAL :p).
Art: 8/10. It is sorta unique, it does follow the animation style of the Visual Novel (which came out first). But it is pretty easy on the eyes. Nice and fluid. No complaints.
Sound: 8/10. No issues here. Right tracks at the right time. Brought out the story perfectly.
Character: 10/10. This is another strong point of the anime. The characters may initially appear shallow and silly but as the anime progresses you start to notice the depth brought out by the events occurring. Certain characters may seem unnecessary and it may have that unlikable harem feel about it, but every character does play their part and contribute to the story in their own important way.
Enjoyment: 7/10. I may be a little harsh, but I cannot deny the fact that the first 3-5 episodes were totally confusing and somewhat boring (Steins;Gate fans, please don't hate, I speak the truth). Watching it a second time, and a third time I didn't have that problem of initial confusion since I KNEW the plot beforehand, but your first time may hurt a little. ;( Like I said, give it a chance and stick with it, and you'll find it worth your time and then some.
Overall: 10/10. Nothing more to say.
If you're a first time viewer, I'd die to be in your shoes, having no knowledge of the plot. ;-; Don't keep it waiting! Do yourself a favour and watch this! It's pretty much the Holy Grail of anime.",10

                Okabe Rintarou is one of those characters that I feel have become common in recent years. He is whimsical, spontaneous, and simply fun to watch. Be it a police procedural or a murder mystery, shows with protagonists that have these characteristics tend to be entertaining, but they often seem to outshine the others on the show. Fortunately Steins;Gate doesn't have this problem. All of the characters we encounter are interesting and amusing in their own way, with plausible personalities. This is one of the reasons I found Steins;Gate to be so fun to watch. As I followed Okabe and his crew try to take over
                  the world, foil the malicious plots of the Organization, and prevent another world war, I was never once bored. The show was unrelenting, keeping me on the edge of my seat all the way through.¬†
The show starts off with a bang, with regular doses of comedy, intrigue, and references to aged Internet memes. As we get acquainted with the members of the Future Gadget Lab the plot is light-hearted. But as the story progresses and Makise gets thrown in the mix viewers are encouraged to think to keep up. There's another reason that this Anime stands out, it makes you want to understand everything that's happening, occasionally forcing you to rewind a couple episodes to reaffirm or check up on something. With other shows if I don't understand something I feel I should go back to previous episodes to check, but rarely do since I usually don't care a whole lot. But with Steins;Gate I was constantly cataloging information in an attempt to keep up with everything. Though this may seem like a nuisance to some I can assure you it truly enhanced the experience.¬†
The story revolves around time travel, certainly an idea worked to death by the science fiction genre, but this Anime did a respectable job of keeping things interesting and fresh. The show presents us with new ideas about time travel, opening up a new avenue of possibilities. Thrown together with a global conspiracy concerning SERN, the plot never fails to deliver. At time the story is complex but never convoluted; and helps to elevate the show to greater heights.¬†
It doesn't surprise me that this show is so highly rated on MAL, it really deserves the recognition it receives. Though the show may not work for everyone I think it will work for most, and deserves a place on everyone's list.¬†",9

                After hearing a lot of good comments about this anime, I tried it out and to my surprise, it wasn‚Äôt just good but instead, IT WAS A FUCKING MASTERPIECE. I promise to keep the spoiling minimum and anything that I will mention could be seen in the first few eps. Let‚Äôs start with the review, shall we?
Story: There is absolutely no anime that can beat Steins;gate in terms of a good storyline, or at least there isn‚Äôt one that I‚Äôve heard of. I can write an entire essay to describe and discuss the story of Steins;gate but to put it simply, it has one of
                  the most well planned plots that will keep you hooked starting from the first episode. It starts of starts of as a sort of comedic anime, and shifts into a darker tone later in the series. The best thing about it though is that you can never be sure what would happen next. One episode they are laughing and having fun then next episode, the story gives you a complete mindfuck. It can really make you think about what will happen next, and just when you are sure about what will happen, some plot twist happens and gives you a many questions as the last arc answered. Overall, I would give it a 10/10 because I can‚Äôt give it an 11/10, and I‚Äôm not even being biased, it just really is that awesome.
Art: The art is surprisingly, normal. Since the anime is story-driven, it doesn‚Äôt really matter if there isn‚Äôt any eye-candy or uber awesome animation. It doesn‚Äôt mean that the animation sucks though, it‚Äôs just that there isn‚Äôt really anything special about it. It‚Äôs just that a more normal look gives it a better atmosphere than flashy graphics although there are those moments that just look plain awesome like when the world line changes. Overall I give it an 8/10.
Sound: Unlike in other animes, Steins;gate has very little music. It doesn‚Äôt rely on music to create tension but only relies on the story itself. Although that being said, there is some sort of music cue that goes off when something interesting is about to happen. The voice acting though is a different story though. The voice actors completely capture the voices of those whom they are portraying. I think Okarin‚Äôs voice actor deserves a special mention here. He portrayed Okabe‚Äôs mad scientist personality perfectly. I mean, half of the comedy comes from Okabe‚Äôs monologue(which is just him talking to his phone) and his crazy speeches about the organization and some other random things. Overall, I give it a 9/10.
Characters: The characters in this series are quite unique, and most of them have interesting personalities. It can be said that half the fun from watching this anime is in seeing how the protagonists Okabe and his lab members develop their unique personalities. Take Okabe for example. At first he is a happy-go-lucky person with a mad scientist fa√ßade but later into the story he starts to break down and turn into a more well-defined character, due to the tragedies that is happening around him, and because he knows that he is in the center of it all. I could go on and write a synopsis about how every character in the story becomes who they are but I‚Äôll just shorten it and say that in this anime, every character has a certain depth and no character is ever left hollow. Overall I give it a 10/10 for having great character development, and I specifically didn‚Äôt write a lot on this topic because it might spoil some things in the anime.
Enjoyment: Steins;gate is one of the very few animes that I truly enjoyed watching. It can make you laugh and cry, it can boggle your mind with numerous questions and it will certainly entertain you. This is one of those animes that really will thrill you and entertain you and keep you on the edge of your seat all throughout. There are very few animes that can provide the same amount of enjoyment in only 24 episodes so let me tell you this: Steins;gate is one hell of an anime and every second I have spent in watching this anime is a second well spent. Overall I give it a 10/10.
Overall: In my opinion, very few animes can match Steins;gate in terms of depth, character development and overall enjoyment. Rarely have I seen such work of art and truly believe that this is one of those gems hidden among other animes. The story is perfect, the characters are perfect, and overall I find this anime perfect. I give it a 10/10 for simply being one of the best out there.
This is really an anime that is worth watching and if you are reading this, I highly recommend watching this anime because I can assure you: it will entertain you for hours on end and that it really does live up to its reputation. 
Thanks for reading and if there is anything wrong or if you find this review helpful or if you just want to flat out tell me that it sucks, please do comment on my page and give me your feedback.It really helps.",10

                Ok. Here goes nothing.
Wow. Steins;Gate.
I like a lot of things about anime. I like characters that make me laugh, and cry, and beautiful animation that fills the screen with something that can be marveled at and expanded on in my imagination. There are also some things I love about particular anime (and in general, like irl). One of those things is an immaculate story, though out and presented in beautiful fashion. The story should be able to hold its own weight of complexity, and the sound and animation shouldn't be created to take the viewers mind to a different place. There are some great stories
                  in anime, ones that hold there own weight without breaking a sweat. Rarely, however, is there a show that takes an incredibly elaborate story, that can hold its own, and compliments it with dark animation styling and a soundtrack that really isn't full of itself. Oh, and just to get it out of the way... HOUOIN KYOUMA!!
Steins;Gate is about time travel. Kinda. In a way. It's also about cell phones, maid cafes, gelatinous bananas, and a particular androgynous character trapped in the shackles of love. Yes, it sounds weird, but trust me, it get even stranger. In a nutshell, the ""time travel"" presented in the first part of Steins;Gate involves a radio frequency transmitting microwave that, when properly, or improperly, sends a text message back in time. All of the effects caused by the text message, if it had been sent in the past, play out, and the world ""resets"" (It doesn't actually reset, I'm just using that word as a place holder to not spoil the entire idea of the series).
The beauty of the Steins;Gate story comes from how thorough the writers are about making sure every effect is shown in some way or another, as complex it may be. Another big win from Steins;Gate is how well they set up the timeline of the world, as the difference of sending the message one minute later or earlier could result in a much different world.
So you may be thinking to yourself, ""Hey bub. If the world ""resets""-ish thing, how does anything happen if the characters don't really know what happened."" And that is where the plot begins to unfold, because our main character is not affected by the reset, in fact, he is the one traveling backwards through time. 
The characters of Steins;Gate are pretty freaking awesome. Our list of main characters is actually quite long, as alot of the scenes are shot in our lead character, Okabe Rintaro's, lab where the lab members conduct hilarious and mostly pointless experiments. Okabe is an incredibly interesting character. He is eccentric, and almost dual personality at times. He believes himself to be a great MAD SCIENTIST, HOUOIN KYOUMA! He is incredibly melodramatic for the first part of the show, but when things take a more serious turn, his character delivers. By the end of episode 13 I was crying from how incredible his character fits the role that the story of Steins;Gate needs.
The other main characters consist of a cute, happy, childlike friend of Okabe's, an overweight, expert hacker, a sassy scientific genius, a introverted, picture taking woman, a determined androgynous boy, a popular maid cafe worker, and, well, a pretty average girl. While I won't go though every character individually, they all have charm to them that parallels the story's charm perfectly. The characters are really awesome and by the end of they show you will fall in love with them.
The soundtrack of Steins;Gate is fine, though nothing exceptional. There are large segments of the show that are presented with no soundtrack because it really doesn't need it, just like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. In both cases, a soundtrack would make the atmosphere suffer, leading to less intensity or emotion conveyed to the watcher in some scenes. What we get of the soundtrack is good, however, and it fits the mood when it needs to. 
The opening is good, and I enjoyed it. However, unlike many other reviewers, I don't believe there is anything special about the opening of Steins;Gate, as most of the track sounds electronically recorded. It isn't really showcasing any particular instrument, or style, nor does it show much musicality. So it is good. Average. Not amazing.
Voice acting wise, I watched the dub, as I do with most of the anime I watch. I really enjoyed the voice acting, especially for Okabe. I know that the Japanese dub for Steins;Gate is supposed to be incredible, but the English dub is not half bad. Its pretty darn good. If you are someone who prefers watching wiht an English dub rather than a Japanese dub, you will not be disappointed whit Steins;Gate dubbed edition.
The art style of Steins;Gate is really cool. It uses darker shades of color and lots of shadow because well, the story is pretty dark. The art fits the story nicely, but its not really gorgeous. The ""wallpaper worthy"" moments are few and far between. That being said, the art nicely compliments the show overall, and that all I would really ask for, since the story is so good.
Steins;Gate is one of those anime that I would recommend to just about anyone, as long as you can handle it. Have you seen Inception, or Memento, or read a book like Before I Go To Sleep, or some other confusing, jagged piece of media? The first few episodes of Steins;Gate are very confusing, and should be watched with a focused mind. After that, just enjoy.
Overall, Steins;Gate stands as one of my favorite pieces of moving media of all time. It's story is beautiful, and it has a nice soundtrack that helps out when it needs to. Its animation is good, and compliments the dark themes of the show in a subtle way. Its characters will make you laugh, cry, smile, and make you fall in love with the show. I love this show, and I recommend it to anyone who can handle a complex story line. I do hope you watch it if you have not seen it yet, as Steins;Gate Zero is coming soon, and I am incredibly excited for that sequel.
Until my next review, enjoy anime.",9

                Steins Gate - the first time I heard there is a good anime with time travel concepts I thought to myself: ""I have got to watch it... NOW!"". Even though sceptical at the start I kepy at it and oh boy how happy am I that I did.
Story
In the beginning we meet our hero - Okabe Rintarou the Mad Scientist who is about to embark on an adventure full of laughter, sadness, hard work, and impossible odds. Will he succeed? You will have to find out yourself by watching this amazing series.
Now I have to admit I was afraid because most time-travel stories result in
                  our main characters causing the events that they were trying to avoid so I thought it might also be the case here. But to my hapiness this is not how the story goes.
The main premise is that our heroes have the ability to influence the flow of time - they can change events that cause massive differences in their timeline - if you've seen movie ""The Butterfly Effect"" then you know what I'm talking about. While they goof around with this ""ability"" they accidentaly uncover a sinister plot and decide to stop it. But while on this quest our main hero realizes the future he has created is not one he can accept.
The story has pretty much everything I would want from it. First it has an interesting concept, it has humour (often involving our Mad Scientist's escapades) it has friendship and romance. And what's most important it handles all of those in the most satisfying of ways. Every time an episode ends and you face the ending there is only one thought ringing in your head ""I want to see more, I want to see how the story goes from this point"" or ""I can't believe it, I must know what comes next!"". It probably makes this one of my number one cadidates for marathons since it hooks you up so hard you cannot let go untill you see the end.
Art & Sound
For some reason I really liked the art - granted it's not trying to be a visual marvel and bombard us with beautiful images like say ""Byousoku"" would but it is an art style very common to newly released anime (by that I mean 2006/7+) and it really does make you feel like enjoying what you see. The music fits right there as well allowing you to immerse in events happening before your eyes. Opening/ending-wise it really depends on your tastes. I would say the music is the weakest part of the show (and like I said I am very biased because of my musical tastes) but that is only and only because everything else is just so amazing.
Characters
My favourite section here - how could I not write with excitement about characters that made me think about them way after I have finished the series?
First we have Okabe - a guy I find hard not to like. He's funny - allways shouting nonsense about his Mad Science stuff, but also he has a more serious side that makes him overcome impossible odds if the situation requires it.
Then there is Kurisu - a tsundere type. And let me admit I have been angered out of my mind by some tsunderes out there. But guess what - it didn't happen here. I allmost don't want to say a single thing to let you guys experience how can a tsundere-type can be done well. So well in fact that sometimes I even refrain myself from calling her one.
Next comes up Mayuri - a ""cute"" type of character. She seems to allways be happy, oblivious to all the evil in the world. And she fulfills that role really well, after all - tuturuu~ has been ringing in my head for quite a while.
Last but not least - Hashida. A friend of Okabe and an otaku who is just the perfect friend to our MC. He is a true Otaku with all that comes with it but he will not hesitate to come to his friends aid when need be.
Enjoyment 
It goes without saying that when I give anime a 10 - I enjoyed it a lot. And of course I felt so satisfied with every episode I could write a poem. And when the series was over I kept thinking about it non-stop for another week. Thats how big of an impression it leaves in you. 
There is only one thing that I would wish for - if they made more anime as enjoyable as this one, world would be a better place.",10
"
                A hell of a sci-fi time-travel thriller that is equal parts mystery, comedy, and drama, with some squee-worthy romance thrown in for good measure. It does have some not insignificant problems: the time-travelling mechanic is pretty sketchy, for example, and I'm not quite sure that it's as air-tight as it seems to think it is. These waters are muddied further by the fact that the series employs at least 5 different flavors of time-travel, invoking everything from The Girl Who Leapt Through Time to Back to the Future and even Groundhog Day, and is always adding new rules that smack a little bit of contrivance.
                  The real problem for most viewers is going to be the characters though--each is an anime archetype taken to hilarious extremes, which is really going to grind on some viewers, especially in the early episodes. I feel that Steins; Gate is ultimately able to get away with it because the characters' interactions with one another is so golden and leads to some surprising developments (not to mention hilarious--only FLCL and Haruhi Suzumiya rival this anime for comedy), but for some people it's just not going to work, even if they manage to muscle past the main character's quirks. It does help a bit that the characters are all incredibly genre-savvy: when was the last time you met an tsundere anime character who acknowledges her tsundereness? That said, they seem to have never learned a single lesson from time-travelling movies, despite obviously being familiar with them. Getting to like these characters and sympathize with their plight will require some suspension of disbelief--luckily, this being an anime, that shouldn't be *too* hard.
After a lot of initial setup and some character establishing/development, the series takes an incredibly dark turn halfway through that turns the plot onto some bold, unexpected roads, the pay-off to which is as intellectually rewarding as it is emotionally. I find that anime has a long history with weak endings, so to see one where everything comes together like clockwork is immensely satisfying, not to mention it might actually be one of the best ending sequences I've seen in time-travel storytelling, period. I don't really want to talk about the plot too much for fear of spoiling something, but if you've ever seen even one time-travel movie before you'll know pretty much what to expect, though the way in which Steins; Gate kicks off its central dilemma is surprising, to say the least.
In sum, while it deals mostly with archetypes and owes a lot of its charm to its associations with previous time-travelling tales, Steins; Gate is so tightly scripted (where it really counts) and the relationships between its characters so well-realized that over-looking its flaws is almost too easy. It doesn't transcend its problems in the same way that something like Serial Experiments Lain does, but if you can get past the initial stumbling blocks this is one of those series that'll have no problems keeping you really invested in what happens. It's already got something of a reputation for being a 'new masterpiece'--I wouldn't go that far, but there's no denying that it's one of the most fulfilling and complete-feeling series out there. Just do yourself a favor and don't watch it late at night--you won't get to bed until you've finished it.",7
"
                There are good anime series, which make you remember them and smile. There are great anime series, which make you feel attached to every character and make you want to watch them once more. And then there's Steins;Gate.
I don't profess to have watched every anime out there, but from what I have seen, I think Steins;Gate is probably one of the very best series made since the turn of the millennium, which is saying something considering its predecessor ChaoS;HEAd gave me a two-day headache after I'd finished watching it. It's not just because of an exceedingly unconventional but quite sensible concept of time travel (one
                  of the most touchy subjects in anime), or because of the heartwarming relationships (which we are all suckers for, whatever we'd like to admit). It is because of the fact that you can watch it, and rewatch it, and (re)^n watch it, and every time there's something new you will find that will arrest your attention and surprise you. It is precisely that kind of genius which lifts Steins;Gate above many good or even great anime. It has everything the anime medium has to offer-- sci-fi, suspense, romance, comedy, a bit of pretty profound philosophy-- and it seldom offers anything besides the best of all these. 
The story---well, it's pretty simple really: a story of a self-designated 'mad scientist' who discovers that one of his lab's inventions is a machine that can send messages back in time, and, unwittingly, begins a chain of events that might turn his world upside down. Sounds a bit been-there-seen-that? You need to watch this to believe how well they've handled the story. The time travel concept, as I have said, is wonderfully executed, and---well, the plot isn't as much about the time travel as it is about its consequences it has. All in all, the story is straightforward, but REALLY good.
The characters, however, are what comprise the heart and soul of Steins;Gate. Every one of them is special in his/her own way, and will manage to make his/her impression on your mind long after you've finished watching this. Okabe Rintarou alias Crazy Mad Scientist Hououin Kyouma---what to say about him, one just needs to see how many favorites he has on MAL; and for good reason too. Makise Kurisu is another very well thought-out character indeed, and one of anime's best tsunderes (even for me, who generally dislikes them). The supporting cast is brilliant; few anime possess the capability to give so many characters so much development in just 24 episodes. Steins;Gate easily has one of the best cast of characters in any anime I've seen to date. What is most surprising is how this anime has taken many of the traditions popular to the medium--the tsundere, the maid, the airhead, the bishonen, the pervert-- and combined them with a fantastic plot, some serious cliffhanger moments and some truly relatable dynamic between characters to serve up something so novel. It's a case study in balance--the anime is remarkably understated, even in its animation and sound, and never, even in the most emotional situations, overshoots its mark. Whereas most anime either try to be outrageously different (with generally depressing results) or simply offer the same old tropes, Steins;Gate shows exactly how to keep all stereotypes and still make them lovable.
There are really too few flaws to talk about in this thing: there are loose ends here and there that don't add up(in spite of the superhuman amounts of detailing the story has been given) but the plot is so well constructed you are hardly likely to notice unless you are specifically looking for them. Then there is very little 'action' in the real sense of the term, though it isn't necessarily a flaw, so I generally wouldn't recommend this to anyone who loves a lot of gore and things blowing up and stuff. For anyone else this is a must watch.",10
"
                I watched Steins;Gate very early on in my anime viewing journey. Even then, it had a great impact and became a standard that most, if not all animes, could not live up to. I just finished watching it again and it is, without a doubt, one of the greatest shows ever produced. With a compelling story, beautiful art and sound and a set of characters that were unique and loveable, Steins;Gate is one of the most rewarding shows to watch. The start is slow in comparison with the remainder of the story but looking back, it never feels unnecessary. Many of things that occur near
                  the beginning are intimately woven into the latter portions of the show which makes a second watch just as rewarding as the first. This show is truly exemplifies what great anime work is.",10
"
                To start to write a story with a plot that hinges on time travel is a truly foolhardy thing to do. It's an endeavor that requires one to create laws for something that - even if it was hypothetically possible - goes way beyond a human's ability to keep track of. Whatever the nature of time is, it's something so inherent to our perception that to try to objectively understand it is in itself a way to handicap oneself in creating a story. But just because something is hard doesn't mean it should be avoided, and Steins;Gate does a fine job of proving that it's
                  a worthwhile struggle when writing a story.
I have not the faintest clue what the best way to analyze the multifaceted story of this anime so I'll do it in a rambling way that fits a show that has a semicolon in it's two word title. There's much good and bad to talk about, and I believe that despite how the series screws with chronology it's probably best to make a split between the parts of it based on how early or late in the progression they were presented.
The first episode of the series is suitably mysterious while also giving a taste of what's to come. The funky humor that characterizes the first half of the anime especially is already present, but there's also a hint of the time travel and horror to come. It raises plenty of questions without giving any immediate answers. There's really nothing mindblowing going on, as the source of the answers is clearly going to be time travel, even though the specifics are unclear. It's enough to catch your attention without confusing you utterly, thus being a good start to presenting the relatively complicated plot.
What follows the first episode was rather not to my personal liking. I'm hesitant on how to judge these episodes in the first fourth of the series due to how my dislike resulted mostly from the fact that a lot of the humour was simply cringeworthy to me and as such is largely subjective. However, I believe that I'm justified in saying that this part of the anime wasn't handled well because it relied too much on the humor, which shouldn't have been necessary. Even if it didn't almost drive me away, I think the humor simply took space away from actual substance, so that even if I was entertained it still wouldn't have served the story itself well.
The substance wasn't entirely absent however, since this part of the series at least started introducing the characters and laying groundwork for their personalities. This was a crucial part that was handled sufficiently well, if only barely. What it did well was succeeding in presenting a lot of peculiar personalities, but it also managed to make me near enough hate a lot of them due to how they were used for the purposes of humor.
Past the first fourth of the show things slowly started getting better as the depth of all the characters was slowly shown. I don't know why that depth was hidden so long, but I managed to somehow soldier through long enough to see it anyway. With each episode I started appreciating the characters more and more, which was absolutely necessary for what was to come. As it became evident that these characters were as they were because of their experiences as people rather than an attempt at humor at their expense, I could begin to understand the basis of the story more and more. And as the characters became more interesting, so did their playing around with a time machine. Morals are tied to people, and as such dealing with morally questionable matters in a story also requires believable characters to relate to those morals.
Around the halfway point is when the main plot of the story really started rolling, the exponentially increasing momentum seemingly almost getting completely out of hand. The funky humor of the series was finally starkly contrasted by how the story turned to near enough horror. The idea that screwing with time is something to be taken seriously in the hypothetical setting where it's actually possible became crushingly evident. At this point the story started dealing more and more with morals and psychology, as each character was tested in their turn. This was only possible due to the characters being so very believable despite (and because) of their peculiarities.
The ever increasing depth of the characters is perhaps the most important and impressive part of the entire anime, the driving force that makes the experience truly impactful for the viewer. It's the only way I can imagine that can not only do that but also keep a story about time travel on track. Beyond the ten or so meticulously built characters there is a world that changes drastically each time they meddle with their time machine, giving the story plenty of chances to be terribly pretentious. But instead of that the characters and viewer both only glimpse the varied possible timelines through another character whom has been personally affected by these changes in different ways each time. A person they know, whom is a part of their group, not some obscure ideal.
The same theme becomes stronger and more evident throughout the series, as the main character struggles to find the determination to see it all through. In the end he doesn't care about changing the world even when told it's all up to him to prevent disaster. What he fights for, seeks to retain, is his own small group of friends that he loves. It's not for some higher ideal, but for his own selfish desires. It's almost pathetic, but that's where the excruciating beauty of it lies, the culmination of all of the story. He's a human with completely human motivations, not an obscure ideal of a hero, and that's why he not only wants to, but actually can change things.
Time travel is an integral part of the premise and the plot, but it's not the core of the story. As the latter half of the story slowly digs deeper into the idea of time travel it's only done at the behest of human interests, which is why it remains at it's rightful place as what enables the story, instead of running away with it. It's not done amazing well, but it serves its purpose. To keep it under control the concept and method of time travel had to be brought to a mostly integral and simplistic level, and this had to be done through a variety of contrived rules and regulations that have no base in actual reality. 
That is to say, there's absolutely nothing believable about the time travel when considering it scientifically or even just common sense. This is where the idea of suspension of disbelief comes in. Steins;Gate doesn't happen in our reality but in a fictitious world where time travel works under these contrived rules. It's all about context. What is crucial is the essence of the story of a small number of humans. In this way the time travelling of the story is extremely believable. It retains internal consistency and thus the story makes logical sense and that is how it retains its worth despite the sacrifices made in other areas. That doesn't mean that those sacrifices are solely a good thing for the story, for it could have been even more interesting without them, but I have never seen time travel dealt with better, in practice. If the first part of the series was used better, the time travel aspect could perhaps have been afforded more detail, but it's quite impressive as is.
And thus arrives the conclusion. Well, partly it happened in the start of the anime but... nevermind. The point is, the last three episodes of Steins;Gate are the best ending I have ever seen in an anime. The range of feelings it instilled me goes beyond what should be possible within such a short span; just saying that it made me cry in desperate sadness and smile in relieved happiness doesn't do it justice. The way the story delivers its conclusion on each theme it dealt with and wraps up every tightly controlled storyline is truly masterful. I have never been so completely satisfied at the end of a story.
_________________________
I guess I'm also obliged to mention the technical achievements of the anime, though they feel so utterly irrelevant after all that. Yet the truth is that the fact the art and the sound design of the anime keeping up with the story is very important, and quite impressive in this particular case.
The best word to describe the art is 'solid'. It does everything it needs to even though it's not the most beautiful I've ever seen. At no point did the art cause any confusion to me, as it blended well with what was happening. Crisply detailed, yet keeping its own artistic charm the backgrounds always fit the mood of the story. The character designs were simple enough, but they were just as lively as the personalities they accompanied. At times there were even flashes of excellence, particularly when related to the time travel aspect of the anime, depicting the nature of the change very impactfully.
Similar things can be said about the sound design of the series. Not one sound ever seemed out of place. But even beyond that, the sound of the anime was often absolutely masterful on top of serving its purpose. The voice acting, a most crucial part in an anime with such a small selection of throuroughly designed character, was spot on. It always augmented each scene brilliantly, bringing the characters to life fully. There wasn't a single bit of noise without some sort of purpose, yet all in all it never felt like something was missing in that aspect either. And just the amount of importance in the most basic possible sound of phone was actually amazing. The music was also just great, mixing with all the other aspects excellently. And of course, the opening and ending songs of the anime capture the nature of it beautifully, aside being just beautuful to listen to.
All in all, the complete package is of great and consistent quality. There are flaws in the execution and the content both, but few of them were blatant enough to be really harmful to the whole, and there were of course also times were it was also impressed me greatly. Throughout the entire series it only keeps improving until the absolutely outstanding ending. The fact remains that in many areas there could be improvement, but the whole is excellent. It should be worth anyone's time, but also I also wouldn't blame anyone that was driven away by the start of the series.",9

                ""I am the mad scientist... Hououin Kyouma!"" - Okabe Rintarou, Steins;Gate
What are dreams? What if the dreams we experience aren't just our imagination running wild but just memories from an alternate timeline?
Shows that involve time travel is present in both Japanese and Western culture. Great examples are the anime Oda Nobuna and the Western show titled ""Doctor Who""; however, these shows simply have time travel involved as a plot device. It is one thing to write a story involving time travel, but it is a COMPLETELY different thing to write one about the act of time travel. Writing a story about the latter is extremely
                  difficult, and if you go about it wrong, you either confuse the viewer or your show comes out really crappy. Steins;Gate is a story about time travel. One that although the rest of the world says ""You can't do it!"" or ""It's hard to write about!"", Steins;Gate just flips up its collar and says ""Watch me."" Now, initially, I was skeptical about this show. I mean, it's ranked #2 in the world, but by episode 4, I was bored to death with its slow pacing. The characters kept me interested enough to continue watching, however. Once episode 9 came along, shit hits the fan, and you're hooked with the show. Looking back at it now, I really see why Steins;Gate is ranked so high. Why is this show ranked so high compared to the other countless of shows in its genre? Read on more to find out.
Steins;Gate in a single word can be best described as a masterpiece. Intially slow to start, the writers quickly suck you in with the story's interesting premise and characters. Although the pacing during the first half is unbearably slow, I believe that it was necessary to clear any confusion the viewer might have on the concept of time travel. With the first half out of the way (along with the questions), the second half is brilliantly executed, with massive ""OH SHIT"" moments at the end of almost every episode. I honestly can't find any flaws with the story. If you hate the slow first half, BEAR WITH IT. What comes after is probably the best written and executed second half of any anime I've watched. (Story: 10/10)
Earlier in this review, I mentioned that the characters were interesting. That's an understatement. They are the definition of interesting. First we have our self proclaimed ""mad scientist"", the ""supah hakah"", a girl that goes 'tuuturu', and a tsundere redhead. If that sentence alone wasn't interesting for you to read, then I don't know what is. In short, the characters are likeable, laughable, and dynamic--three traits that many series neglect to place in their characters. If you were bored with the slow pacing of the first half of the show (like I did), these characters will help you get through it. (Characters: 10/10)
Just like the rest of the show, the animation is different. Don't get me wrong; it isn't bad by any means. Drawn to fit the mood of the show, the characters and their designs are fine. But that's all they are: fine. They aren't jaw dropping, amazing, or extraordinary by any means. The artwork of the show in general is meh. It's like getting a present for Christmas that you like; however, it isn't what you actually wanted. In the same regard, Steins;Gate was drawn fine--there was no extra detail, no extra effort in its coloring, and nothing extraordinary about its backgrounds. The artwork in this series was just enough to get by--nothing more, nothing less. (Artwork: 8/10)
The sound suffers the same as the artwork. Although the voice acting, along with the OP and ED are top-notch, I feel as though the background music didn't give the same effect as say Clannad or Toradora. The producers could have put a little more effort in the BGMs of this show. Perhaps then, the show could have had much more of an impact on the viewers. (Sound: 8/10)
I'll reiterate what I said earlier in this review: Steins;Gate, in short, is a masterpiece. Honestly, I watched this show because I was wondering why such a show would be ranked #2 on MAL and #1 on ANN. I went in expecting to find a bunch of plotholes and inconsistencies (since some top-rated shows are overhyped/overrated by its fans), but I was pleasantly surprised. Steins;Gate certainly lived up to its rating. I can now see why this story is rated #1, not only on ANN, but also on my list of my favorite anime of all time. (Overall Enjoyment/Overall: 10/10)",10

                This is probably the best series of 2011, period. It has been a while since the release of another great series that would be forever remembered as a classic.
Steins;Gate is a sci-fi genre anime which focuses on a group of college students living in Akihabara which stumbles onto a accidental discovery of a time machine. The plot then follows the 'Future Gadgets Laboratory' and how such discovery can be used to change the course of history, along with the venerable dangers that can occur from such actions.
Story: 10/10
The story is extremely well written for an anime adapted from a VN. There are also quite a
                  bit of real-life references that are thrown into the mix; even I confess to using Google to look up certain terms, items and terminology to understand what they were. 
The plot begins with a lot of ambiguity and confusion with a rather slow paced approach to the introduction of the main cast. However, as the plot thickens, you can definitely sense an air of unrest and it naturally draws you in with suspense.
The latter half then comes quite hard. I won't go too into details here to avoid spoiling, but this is one of the calling cards to why I call this the series to watch for 2011 season.
I also note the transition from light hearted comedy to dangerous suspense scenes are done exceptionally well, something I noted that is not done too well in the recent years of anime.
Art: 9/10
As my own sister quoted, Steins;Gate original art for the VN was unique that it used huke's art style, who previously done the work for Black Rock Shooter. The anime attempts to carry that unique style over as much as possible, but in effort to not raise the budget to eye-popping levels, a more solid color palette is chosen.
Each character design is unique and interesting without being over-styled. The art for the background of Akihabara is also a plus to those who often visit this anime haven.
Sound: 10/10
The music always fits the mood and is definitely composed well. The main theme and piano arrangement is something I still often listen to on my player today. 
Again like the plot, the transition between pieces are something that's done well corresponding to the given situation.
Characters: 10/10
The main cast is probably the best part of Steins;Gate. Each character never feels cliche in any manner while retaining their unique personalities. Each character, even secondary characters (a rarity in anime these days) is also covered well in the story, so for the audience it becomes easy to relate and 'see' in the eyes of the cast. 
Steins;Gate is made into a gem due to the great casting and voice acting which truly reflects the personalities of the characters. The interaction between the main cast is often golden without being overly obnoxious. Genius. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
With the comments above, need I say more?
Overall: 10/10
I do rarely give out 10s in such a easy manner. However, Steins;Gate gets only the highest of praises for bring a series that incorporates such an innovative story with a intriguing, interesting yet lovable cast together in a complete package.
I do highly recommend anyone who has yet to watch this masterpiece, and better yet introduce this series to those who don't watch anime to give it a try.

                So, obviously there are quite a number of reviews for Steins;Gate that convey how I feel about it very very well. However, if you're someone who is still on the fence about watching this show, allow me to attempt to persuade you to start.
Steins;Gate is simply put, one of the-if not the- best pieces if fiction I have ever seen. Here's why.
Steins;Gate is from the outside, a seemingly simple tale of a group of friends who want to achieve time travel. Really, that's it for the first half of the show. In fact, I'll admit that I was only mildly interested throughout the first twelve
                  or so episodes, until a sudden twist changed my opinion in one fell swoop.
What starts out as a relatively quirky, funny story slowly morphs into a resounding mix of science fiction and drama, with thrills and revelations in between. Going in depth,
Story: As I said, the first half of the show is quite slow paced. It serves to establish the world, the characters, their motivations and their interactions. It might seem trivial, but this helps the viewer better connect to the characters on screen, allowing us a sense of attachment. In this, our protagonist, Okabe Rintarou- pardon me, Houhin Kyouma- introduces us to the supporting characters in the show, and thus they go about working on the time machine. There's really nothing more I can add to the first half without spoiling the story, so we'll move on.
It is worth noting, that time travel is done exceedingly well here, and if you're familiar with the concept, you know how hard that can be. There are solid, well defined rules and restrictions, along with certain criteria that keep the concept interesting throughout. Couple that in with the thriller aspects of the story, and you've got a damn fine sci-fi on your hands.
Midway through the story, as I've mentioned, there occurs a sudden twist that changes everything for Okabe. I won't spoil it, but suffice to say, the event pushes him to his psychological limit, and the entire second half is him in a frantic battle against fate itself, all the while being questioned by the choices and sacrifices he has to make. All of this culminates in some of the most emotional final episodes I have ever seen, period, and I can guarantee you that the show will have you hooked well enough to tug at your heart.
Thus, Story: 10/10
Art and Animation: Hmm. This is perhaps one area where Steins;Gate may seem lacking, but to be perfectly honest, all the other factors were so good, I couldn't be bothered to find faults with it. It works well enough to tell the story it's supposed to, and certain moments are very nicely done.
Art: 9/10
Sound: Honestly, Sound is not such a big deal in the show. Average openings and endings, I suppose, and for the most part, all the effects and backgrounds are nicely done. It does excel in certain segments, so you can't exactly fault it.
Sound: 8/10
Characters: Ah yes, this is where Steins;Gate truly shines. You would be hard pressed to find a single character without well defined motivations and flaws in this show. Well, maybe Mayuri, but no one else.
Take Okabe, our lead. Initially, he's quirky, funny, has a penchant for the theatrical, and is a rather fun character to follow. He seems rather childish, with his hysterical laughs, fake codes, imaginary persona, and all. But, as the show progresses, you see another side of him, a side that's mature and thoughtful, pained and panicked, yet almost never giving up. He's not perfect, by any means. There are moments when he falters, when he's gripped by fear, when he makes rash decisions, or when he's just plain nonchalant(first half). And how does he make it through? Because he's supported by the best cast this side of sci-fi anime.
Makise Kurisu is clearly, the foil to Okabe. She's doubtful when he rushes in, collected when he's panicked, and they're mostly at each other's throats with one liners and jokes. But when things go awry, it's her that gives Okabe his strength and will to continue, helping him understand what he needs to do and the importance of said task. She's smart, well developed, and resourceful.
If it seems like those two are set up for a romance, that's because they are. Alongside Mayuri, a girl that Okabe has taken ""hostage"". I'll be honest, I don't really understand her characters, heck, she was borderline annoying for the most part. But even so, there were genuine moments when I could see she and Okabe cared for for one another, and when it comes to the conclusion of the love triangle, it really does feel like Okabe can go toward Makise or Mayuri. 
Other characters include Hashida, Okabe's main tech guy, Faris, a popular girl that works at the same cafe Mayuri works at, Kiryu, a shy girl that's interested in an IBN 5100 computer that Okabe is also looking for, Urushibara, a boy who looks like a girl, and Amane, a girl searching for her father.
All of the above are extremely well developed, with motivations and agendas of their own, and believe me when I say, it's hard to dislike any one of them. Yes, even Mayuri.
Characters: 10/10 
Enjoyment: It is a bit of a drag to sit through the first half, wondering when something's going to happen, but the emotional impact you feel in the second half and the resolution to Okabe's problems make it more than worth it.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Overall: A series that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone, whether they be interested in science fiction, drama, romance, or even humor. And now, I'm recommending it to you; if you still haven't seen it, then by all of Mayuri's Upas, go watch it right now!

                Story: 10/10
The anime starts off really slowly and for me, and I found it a bit complicated to understand.  However, all of it made sense as the story progress. What I thought should have been done is some flashbacks on what happened in the future rather than it being told as a dialogue. It got my head spinning most of the time but that's what I liked about this anime. Steins;Gate makes you think, it gives you hint, but it breaks your predictions. There's lots of plot twists that made the anime unpredictable which is why it's not like any other anime out there.
                  This one is unique!
Art: 9/10
It's art is not the best but it works well with the dark vibes the anime gives out. I actually think that this art style suits this anime a lot more than the art style in the manga. 
Sound: 10/10
The OSTs got me so excited everytime I watch each episode. There were also the use of silence which inevitably tensed the scenes which made my heart beating so fast or my soul wanting to scream out. 
Character: 9/10
The character Okabe is made very well and likeable with his crazy English(I do wonder at times on how he learnt them). I liked how he changed into being serious when things go wrong. The story revolves around him so he surely have the best character development compared to others. 
Kurisu was introduced as one of those clich√© characters, the cool type, genius, pretty and mysterious. But her being a tsundere made her more enjoyable to watch. She and Okabe are like cats and dogs and watching their arguments was pleasurable.
Mayushi on the other hand for me is an annoying character. I didn't like how she spoke childishly and moe-like. I don't mean to hate that kind of character because I found Feyris adorable. But that was my first impression on the character Mayushi and she did became more likeable towards the end. (I cried... continuously). I also thought that she would become a character that will surprise us due to how she was introduced. 
Another character that didn't give me a great first impression was Daru. He's a... 'fat otaku. Of course, with that description, the word 'pervert' comes in as a bundle. But then again, as the story goes on, he became a lot more likeable and his perverted jokes made me laugh a lot. Also the writer gave him a 'plot twist' that in my opinion was predictable but greatly portrayed. Daru's character could have been improved if he changed even a little bit throughout the anime. Maybe a little more serious?
Ruka- Well, 'this person' you could say is the prettiest in the anime. 'This person' had very short appearances and little affect on the plot. 
Moeka- As far as I know, a lot of people hate her but I don't because I understand her situation and I hope that when you watch this, you will do too.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Steins;Gate is full of jokes, suspense and drama. I can tell you that I cried watching it each episode. All the cliff hangers seduces me into clicking the next episode. I'm always left with wanting to watch more and so, I ended up staying all night just to finish. It's that kind of addiction. It was a very enjoyable anime to watch and I recommend it to EVERYONE.
Overall: 10/10
Full marks and this is now one of my favourite anime of all time. I will watch this again in the future, perhaps on the year 2036 :D
I initially wanted to write a short review but because I had a lot to say, it ended up this long. Well, this is my first long review so it will not be as good as  other reviewers.",10
"
                I watched this show right after Chaos head and given that they go together (or are supposed to in some respect) I wasnt expecting much if anything. However once I got into the show, I saw that it was going to be drastically different from chaos head and was on a level of its own, very much deserving of the high rankings it has recieved. Without further ado, my review.
The story is one that never fails to intrigue people, as it follows a group of friends as they manage to build a time machine. This is almost certain to draw people in as we all
                  have thought about what we would do given the opportunity to time travel. These guys however dont aim for the grandure or almost impossible goals that many would if they were given the chance to alter their pasts. This follows the group as they live out a span that is around 3 weeks in time, but since it is about time travel, alot more happens in these 3 weeks than would normally.
Something that as a viewer you should be aware of is that the show does start slowly(at least in my opinion), and about halfway through the overall prgression just halts, but as ive stated, this is mainly due in part to the time traveling. 
The characters were so... bland, at least at first to me. I say this because they dont really seem to have very much personality, but quite quickly my view of this was able to change(even though, im not quite sure when). The main character is okabe rinturo and he fancies himself a mad scientist and while thats all well and good, the whole schtick that he was working with got stale rather quickly, but once they quit cramming the idea down our throats I liked him far more. Aside from him you have the perky friend who is a girl but not a girlfriend, a second scientist, a steriotypical computer geek, and humorously enough a rather beautiful character (who is a dude).
As far as my enjoyment goes, it was in following the plots that they cook up in order to try and revert the changed world that they had created back to the world that it had previously been. Whats more, these characters who I initially pegged as emotionally shallow quickly turn into very expressive induviduals which I was very happy to see. Finally I will say this: even though Steins Gate didnt impress me at first, it obviously turned me around so much that I cant stop kissing its perverbial ass now, which more than justifies the high praise that Steins Gate has earned!",10
"
                 If you had told me a few months ago that the best representation of Time travel and it's consequences would be in anime form, I would wonder what you'd been smoking; Anime does many things well, but it can sometimes fail at telling a deep and convincing story handling sci-fi elements in favor of Fan-Service and OTT action scenes (I'm not averse to either, but they have a time and a place!)
 But I watched Steins;Gate, a Time Travel Drama/Thriller based off a Graphic Novel. And at first, for about 3 episodes, I thought it was great, what with it's Well-voice acted characters (in
                  both Japanese and English), and its real world references, AND some great dialogue. But as the shows went on, It became less about Time-Travel, and more about giving really lame 1 episode arcs to female characters who basically constituted a harem show, and by episode 11, I was feeling a bit let down. The characters were good, but the story was going nowhere. And then something happens. Something crazy. And it all goes to hell.
 I usually wouldn't say that much about story in a review, but I feel it's important so that people don't decide to drop the show. Just give it time, and the payoff is immense.
 But the shows best point is by far it's characters, though there aren't many, considering it's a 24 episode show, with only about 10 named characters. But because of this, each one contributes in huge ways to the plot, and you grow really attached to each. You have the Main character Okabe Rintarou, a young physicist with the biggest God complex I have ever seen. But he's oddly lovable, and oozes charisma, and as the series progresses, he evolves into a good guy, maybe even a great one.
Other notable ones include: Makise, a physicist who is trying to also discover time travel, and is one of the most down to earth characters in anime; Daru, the hacker who is basically the only person with any actual skill; And Mayuri, Okabe's Little sister/Best friend/ Girl friend who actually contributes very little but is really cute. 
 However, the shows biggest problem also lies with its characters, with three of them only existing to pad out the harem elements of the show, which actually really goes against the serious tone of the show. Im not saying they weren't needed, they just need to be girls, and they DEFINITELY didn't need to have Semi-Relationships with Okabe. It just feels shoehorned, and brings the show down a bit.
 That said, I really love this show. It has a brilliant opening and ending, though the actual show features very little music, which suites the them, quite bland and bleak. But this point is made most by the Art, which has very little color, using lots of whites and grey's, and a really odd filter is sometimes applied which makes the show feel surreal. It's odd, but not wrong.
 And with all my plot niggles, the second half is seriously incredible. I have never seen desperation portrayed so well in an anime, nor have I seen time-travel done so well in anything ever. With that in mind, I give steins;gate a 9/10!",9
"
                Many people told me that Steins;Gate is really worth to watch it, other said that its boring and they weren't able to finish it. I can understand both. I start watching Steins;Gate, because many of my friends told me to do. But I noticed fast that the anime isn't that good, the first ~12 episodes were really agonizing to watch. I always hoped for a whole large story, but all I get were many short stories, without a real connection. But after a few more episodes it was getting more and more interesting, because every of that short stories were part of a big one.
At
                  the end I am really happy that I didn't dropped Steins;Gate.",8
"
                Steins;Gate was originally a visual novel game for the Xbox 360. The game was released in Japan in 2009 and reached 4th in overall sales for the 360 that year. The rapid success and high critical reception to the game naturally prompted several manga versions, all by different writers and a TV anime which was written by yet another author, Hanada Jukki, which made me wary since he's been involved with some really bad anime. I can't say which version of Steins;Gate is the best. The game was only released in Japan and, as far as I know, no translations are available. The manga are
                  currently ongoing and I haven't read them, so I can't say if the anime follows any of them. All I can talk about is the anime.
The story begins with a young mad scientist named Okabe Rintaro who attends a lecture on time travel. After the lecture he finds a female scientist named Makise Kurisu lying in a pool of blood with a knife by her body. He sends a text to one of his friends and the entire world changes around him. Suddenly, there's no record of the lecture having taken place and Makise Kurisu is fine, with no memory of being stabbed or even having met him before. He can find no record of anything he saw occurring. He convinces Makise Kurisu to join his lab and they quickly figure out that one of his gadgets is a time machine and when it's used only he retains knowledge of how things were before. At first doing a few experiments seems harmless enough, but then things start to go wrong... It may seem like I've given away a lot, but trust me, this is all information that you get pretty early on in the series. The main focus of the anime is Okabe trying to use his time machine to change the future he's witnessed. It has strong themes of camaraderie and fate. The whole thing is very well constructed and possesses a lot of intrigue. It has some very funny moments that help lend verisimilitude to the series and likability to the characters. That being said, it does have some issues. One is that some of the major plot twists are really predictable and it kind of hurts their impact. Another is that the fate theme is taken so far that it gets a bit ridiculous. The final issue is that sometimes the trips through time don't have the consequences they logically should. 
Most of the characters are very compelling and the time travel motif allows them to be developed in a way they couldn't otherwise. Most of them are given solid motivations as well. There are only two major exceptions, Mayuri and Itaru. Both remain pretty flat as characters throughout the series. The opportunities that come up to develop their characters end up having no real impact on them.
The art is mostly pretty good. There are some cases where it looks a bit rushed but they don't come up too often. 
The voice acting is well done overall. The only real issue I have with it is that some of the characters are voiced in really exaggerated ways, the most prominent examples being Moeka and Mayuri, and it really undercuts the serious moments of the series. The music suits the series well and helps set the tone. 
The yuri factor is a 2/10. The beginning has some deliberately homoerotic moments between Mayuri and Kurisu. The reason I say it's deliberate is that the characters themselves draw attention to it. 
My Final rating for Steins;Gate is a 7.5/10. It could be better, but it's certainly a good anime. It presents some intriguing ideas, interesting characters and a good scenario.",7
"
                Steins;Gate is a masterpiece! It has shown new possibilities in anime and other shows in general. It has done some research on time travel and time travel theories to come up with a story that is based on time travel. Using these different time travel theories and past real-life events, it made the story outstanding, unique and overall enjoyable to watch. The theme and concept of time travel that is used was so intriguing to me that I was able to complete the series on the same day that I watched it. I binge watched this show like crazy. 
I definitely recommend this anime to
                  anyone as it is one of the best, if not the best, animes out there. 
P.S. the voice acting on Okabe and Mayuri are outstanding!",10
"
                Overview: Steins; Gate is an absolute masterpiece. Not only does it reach to do a lot of things, but it does them damn well. This show is an absolute must-watch for almost anyone, but be ready for a lot of information crammed into the first half of the show; It's important to go into this with the right mindset.
Story: 31/37: 
There's nothing to it- the story of Steins; Gate is amazing. They use time travel as not just a gimmick, but one of the the most important aspects to the plot. Countless games and shows have found this to be incredibly difficult to do without
                  either having strange occurrences or significant plot holes, however, after sorting things out in my head for a bit when the show had finished, I could find nothing of the sort. 
One thing many people complain about is the pacing. The beginning is slow... VERY slow. If you don't like the slice of life genre, you almost certainly won't like the first 7 or so episodes. To make it worse, there's a lot of info shoved into those early episodes and while you shouldn't try too hard to understand everything, if you don't pay attention, it makes it tough to really appreciate how incredibly well put together the latter half of the series is. As a disclaimer, though, I only put this as a negative for some amount of objectivity. If you're like me, and like Slice of Life, these early episodes are still really fun to watch.
Once past the early section of Steins; Gate, though, you won't be able to put it down. There are a few good fast-paced episodes, and then after the climax, the adrenaline never stops pumping. It just gets absolutely intense. By the end of it (especially since there's still a good amount of information stacked into the episodes), my mind was just numbed. It was one of the single best after-effects and anime has ever had on me, and I hope everyone who ever watches anime can experience the same thing. 
Characters: 33/37
If the story of Steins; Gate was amazing, the characters are even better. There are two significant factors that went into scoring this a 36. The first factor was my dislike for one of the, in my opinion, extremely bland characters: Moeka. She just has no personality, and while once her story is revealed, she gets a little better, it's still not enough to justify how boring of a character she is, especially when surrounded by all of the other amazing mains.
Now, you may wonder why the Character Score is still a 33/37, and that's because, in my opinion (of course), Steins; Gate has the single, undisputed best main character development in anime. Rintarou Okabe is just pure genius. He starts out as a super weird self-proclaimed genius, who talks to himself over the phone to try and look cool to others. Despite this, it's shown early on that he has a decent heart to him, as even when he's teasing his friend Mayuri, he still gives her the toy he paid for. Throughout the series, though, he grows into a freaking man. After a certain episode where everything goes crazy, he matures tremendously over a short, but reasonable amount of time and turns into a true hero. I can't possibly explain the development in any way to justify how amazing it was, but I fully recommend the show just to see it.
The other characters are also great, and even though Okabe is such an amazing main protagonist, he in no way steals the spotlight from the majority of them. I won't go into detail on any of the others, but they are all done extremely well, and are enjoyable to watch.
Art/Sound: 18/25
There isn't a whole lot to say about the art. It's pretty average, although it does have a unique style in that it doesn't use many bright colours. It goes for a more washed out, realistic (if that's the right word) approach. Also, keep in mind that for some unknown reason the art quality increases significantly after the first episode, but it's still not great compared to a lot of newer anime.
The sound is great overall, but not particularly amazing. There are a few things that decide sound for me: the opening/ending (more emphasis on the OP), series soundtracks, and voices/sound effects.
The OP for Steins; Gate is one of the best I've ever heard. It's just an awesome song, with an awesome visual background. The ending song is also great for an ED, and while I was hoping for even better, I have yet to find more than one or two ED's that I really enjoyed. The soundtracks throughout the series are fine. For the most part, there is nothing that stands out except for the Reading Steiner track, which is really good. The sound effects are fine, but don't really matter or factor in, and the voice acting is top-notch. (Note: This is for the Japanese voices).
Romance: 1/1
This section is basically whether or not there was a romance that I enjoyed. Sorry if this is a spoiler, but I particularly enjoy watching a romance develop, and I wished that other reviews would tell me if I was going to get to see one.
Overall: 83/100
While an 83 might not seem like an incredible score, I can safely say that this is the best anime that I have ever watched. I deducted points from several things that were less important to me specifically in an attempt to be at least relatively objective. These deductions will be listed so that anyone else who may have similar taste can see if they should rate this even higher.
-The slow pacing at the beginning. If you like Slice of Life, add the full 6 points back on.
-Art Quality: If you don't weight the visual quality as highly (don't get me wrong, it is NOT enough to detract from the experience in any way), then add some points or something.
Anyone that is even considering watching this anime should watch it. I give it my fullest recommendation to ALL audiences.

                This would be my first review, so thanks for reading it. 
(Synopsis) Basically, Stein's Gate is about a scientist (Okabe, Rintarou) with his group of friends attempting to make futuristic gadgets in their small 'laboratory' (apartment). One day they accidentally made a machine from a microwave which actually causes the phones they put in to be made into a device which is able to text people in the past.
(Story:10/10) Steins;Gate was able to deliver an exponential performance in terms of story and it really blew me back as to how the plot was created and twisted. Throughout the the anime it didnt make me bored
                  but actually keen to know what would happen in the next episode, which is what everyone looks for in a good anime.always kept me on my toes throughout the season
(Art:8/10) If an anime with good graphics is what you appreciate in anime, the art in Steins;Gate would not dissapoint. It is well drawn and animated but not as detailed as animes like ""Final Fantasy: Advent Children = [Art:10/10]""
(Enjoyment:9/10) Honestly, i am not a fan of sci-fi but i did not regret one bit watching Steins;Gate and with the hints of comedy in the series it adds onto the spice of the anime.",9
"
                After I finally got hooked on anime, this was one of the first anime that I watched. And that was where I made my mistake. This series was just too perfect. And because of this it made me get the feeling of having the rest of the anime I watch after it will never live up to it.
The story starts out slowly, but it snow balls really fast but not to fast to make it seemed rushed. This show really had everything perfect. Animation, Soundtrack, Character Development, Plot. Everything was spot on.
I may not know a lot about anime yet. But This is a must
                  watch for everyone. 
Don't question it. Just watch it.

                It starts off slow to get some character development. I was hesitant to showing this to my siblings but then a certain episode played when I watched it by myself and KBOOM I couldn't stop watching. I usually watch an anime 2 or more times if I think its really good and for this I watched it 3 times. Watched it by myself then with my brother & sisters then my whole family excluding my dad. 
This anime is like Back to the Future & Terminator combined! This anime makes you want the characters to be real.

"
                I find Steins;gate the best anime of this year (till now), it really cheers me up when I dropped unusually boring animes one after another. I also liked Ano hana for the record, but sci-fi gives me more space of thinking into the show.
Story - 9
I'm glad that I managed to endure the first 3 episodes which are only introductions and are REALLY making people dropping it. But when the plot begins to involve with time travelling, I start to feel that there might be a good story. The main-route story is nice and imaginative. While I thought that the anime is for fun and
                  jokes at the 1st episode, unexpected realities appeared one by one which makes me yell ""how can that be"" but yet logical and when I thought about the whole story again after each episode, I got new explanation about past and more imaginations about after. Indeed I can't help myself and played the whole game at about epi 13. Nevertheless the story is among the best of sci-fi animes. Also there are plenty of relax times in the show that give me a laugh and, since I like tsukkomi, I found them quite interesting.
Art & Sound - 8
Firstly I liked the OP. Next, ""Believe me"" is my favourate BGM of the game and it also appeared in anime. The art is normal, not as superior as Hanasaku 1st episode, but as all animes now are of this average art level, who cares?
Character - 9
Very good character design as well as performance.
The two main characters - Kyoma and Cristina - are all of two charasteristics. Kyoma - or the Kyoma mode of Okabe - is quite crazy and always speaks meaninglessly. Cristina, on the other hand is tsundere and always do the job of tsukkomi. However, this ""upside"" characteristic gives good reflection to the ""downside"" charateristic where Okabe is kind-hearted, always helpful to others and Kurisu is an understanding person who always helps Okabe at the best moment. I liked all scenes when this two are together, making either jokes or moving moments.
The other characters are also vivid and I liked Suzuha (not because Tamura Yukari is the cast) for she resembles Takamachi Nanoha who is the ""yasashii yet tsuyoi"" kind of girl.
The 8 main characters as a whole is one of the best groups in animes I've watched.
Enjoyment - 10
Ok. I said I liked sci-fi and tsukkomi and netas, so... Plots involved with time travelling are sometimes confusing, and there are some parts in the story that are quite heavy. Despite this the anime is quite enjoyble.
Overall - 9
As of when I wrote this review, only 19 episodes have been aired. I look forward to watch the best part of the story. It's all for the choice by Steins;Gate. El Psy Congroo.",9
"
                Arguably the best anime of 2011, even surpassing Madoka, in my opinion. I wholeheartedly believe Steins;Gate is able to appeal to audiences of virtually all preferences. The successful incorporation of the many entertaining and captivating elements is clearly what allows this show to rise above the rest. All in all, Steins;gate is a true example of a visual novel adaption done right. 
Art (9/10)
In terms of character design, background detail and whatnot, you get your typical quality when it comes to today's anime. For me, as long as the art/animation is not eye-cancerous and looks like effort has been put into it, I will be
                  satisfied. Going a bit beyond my expectations will net a 9/10 in this category, and the animation for Steins;Gate did just that. You can argue that my artistic expectations aren't that high and I'll probably agree with you on that. What made Steins;Gate get a 9 in this category is the great use of abstract visuals that accompanied the use of the time machine. In an attempt to not reveal any spoilers, all I can say is that the visuals during those scenes enhanced my viewing experience greatly. The animation of the OP also fell into this category of ""abstract animation."" A big part of this category's score was due in part to the parts mentioned above. Solid animation overall. 
Characters (10/10)
On the surface, the characters of Steins;Gate may look to be bland with overused archetypes. You have the seemingly-insane protagonist (Okabe Rintarou), the tsundere (Makise Kurisu), the moe-blob (Shiina Mayuri), the trap (Urushibara Ruka), the ojou-sama (Akiha Rumiho), the typical male otaku (Hashida ""Daru"" Itaru), the genki-girl (Amane Suzuha) and the shy, quiet girl (Kiryuu Moeka). Despite this, virtually all the characters get developed, whether it was a little or a lot, at some point in the series. Being the protagonist, Okabe got the most character development, in my opinion. His experiences with time manipulation essentially shaped him into the person he is at the end of the series. Also, all the ups and downs he went through made it relatively easy to empathize with and relate to him. But it was not only he, himself, that contributed to his development; all the other characters, too, at some point, influenced Okabe to think/act differently. With such a diverse cast of characters, I believe it's hard for one to not be captivated by at least one of them. 
Sound (10/10)
It only took one try for the OP to get me hooked. It also fit as the ""opening"" as the upbeat tempo and great vocals always fired me up for the episode. On the other end, the ED, despite the fact that I didn't really like it, was an excellent choice as there was no episode where it felt out of place. As most episodes ended with a cliffhanger, the ED masterfully set a suspenseful mood, allowing the viewer to think over what they just saw while the song softly plays in the background. The BGM didn't start getting noticeable until the last few episodes of the series. The best piece, by far, goes to Fake Verthandi - a sad, yet beautiful piece. Moving on to voice acting, there were many big names in the cast. Notable VAs were Miyano Mamoru (Okabe Rintarou), Hanazawa Kana (Shiina Mayuri) and Tamura Yukari (Amane Suzuha). 
Story (10/10)
Have you ever thought about time travel? If you had that power, what would you do with it? The common phrase ""with great power comes great responsibility"" rings true here as our main protagonist Okabe Rintarou faces the problem of handling and using a homemade time machine wisely. The story of Steins;Gate tells the tale of one man's experiences with time manipulation and how drastically it can change his life - both for the better and for the worse. Though you may be extremely confused like I was for the first half of the series, all the pieces of the puzzle start coming together, starting in the second half. The story is masterfully told with well-placed cliffhangers at the ends of episodes that leave you thinking and wondering why something happened and what will happen next. I was captivated by the whole story and, now that I'm finished, it left me craving for more. There's a high chance that there won't be a masterpiece of a story like Steins;Gate in quite a while. 
Overall (10/10)
For someone like me who watches mainly anime centered around moe characters, drama and romance, choosing to watch Steins;Gate was, in a sense, like ""stepping out of my comfort zone."" Looking back, I don't regret this decision at all. Through choosing to watch it, I allowed myself to immerse myself in what everybody was calling the ""best anime of 2011."" And now, I can say that I agree with that statement. Steins;Gate has, indeed, greatly impressed me and with a special and a movie in the works (not to mention the English translation of the visual novel), its presence in the anime world won't be disappearing any time soon.
Until then, El Psy Congroo.",10

                Steins;Gate
This is something else and a lot more would need to be explained before making a review that's good enough. But I'm bored ^^
This review is based on the first 3 episodes.
Story: 8
When a girl you comes to you asking what you wanted 15min ago and you don't recognise her, then hours later you find her murdered and next day she is alive and text messages you sent to your friend regarding the murdered girl are gone.
I think you would be going, WTH?! Regardless if you are the guy experiencing it or watching.
Story is VERY interesting and what you need to know is explained and
                  does not bore you. It's well thought out, especially when they explain HOW time-travelling works, which is surprisingly well thought out.
Sci-Fi and Thriller fits perfectly. There is plenty of Comedy in Steins;Gate as well which is actually very funny. And I smell some romance. It's ofc not focused, It's just one of those things you include to make a Series even more interesting. 
It's what we call ""The dot over the i""
I gave it an 8 since in 3 episodes, the story is still telling basics stuff. Synopsis talks about Microwave Phone, which has just recently in episode 3, been revealed.. Basically, it's a big story. I bet it will go 9 or 10 soon.
Art: 8
It's great. Characters have nice forms and it's a unique drawing. It's kinda a mixture between the usual, and Bleach. It could have been better since colours are a bit plain when it comes to different shades. But still very good art.
Sound: 8
I always want to comment the voice acting, but what's the point? Japanese Voice Acting is the best in the world and almost always top class. This case is no different.
Background music is made well and fits well.
Opening was both special and normal. It reminds you of the ""regular"" none-original you can hear a lot, but at the same time, it got that little special that's enough for you to at least remember it when you hear it.
Character: 9
It's shining in this area.
Characters personalities are thought out well and have their special sides.
Rintarou, the Main Character, is very funny as he talks to some secret government that everyone knows that he makes up. For some reason, he keeps doing it. 
It's hard to comment here. Not even all Main Characters have been introduced so that you know they are the main characters. But it's very promising and much of comedy and good personalties in the characters.
I like a lot Rintarou and his best friend ""hacker"" Hashida, a fat pervert that likes making girl say dirty stuff. lol. And Mayuri, the second first member, follows Rintarou almost everywhere and is a very cute kind airhead.
Enjoyment: 10
I'm enjoying this a lot. The connections between the characters is lovely to see, the mild pervert absurdity and the mystery behind time-travelling that might sound in the synopsis that it is something they would do a lot. But Kurisu proved to Rintarou infront of people that Time-Travelling is  theoretically and fact-based impossible. Then it happens in front of her, and Kurisu dispersers chocked. 
It's all mystery, comedy and you haft to watch more. Which is a very good sign that this is good anime.
Overall: 9
If you like a good series with a bunch of comedy combined with a scent of evil and a bigger adventure for a bunch of people to experience. This is a series for you. 
I bet a lot of people would like this. It's not really focused at something like Only Comedy, or Romance, Harem, Shounen, Shojo or Seinen.
This is a series everyone could enjoy because of it's high quality and great story and I believe the majority will like this.",9

                ""It's an intellectual drink for the chosen ones."" -Okabe about Dr. Pepper.
Well, where can I begin? Too many things can be said about this anime.
I didn't play at the VN, so there some things that I don't know.
Okay, let's resume the story first. All the review may contain spoiler, especially one part. 
Okabe Rintarou, also known as Hououin Kyouma, the auto-proclaimed mad scientist. That's the main character. His laboratory contains three members: him, Daru also known as Super-hacker, and Mayuri (Mayushii). In this laboratory, they developed what they've called ""Future Gadget"", all a bit strange, with epic names.
At the beginning, they met Makise Kurisu, a
                  young clever scientist.
One of the machine developed by Okabe is the phone microwave [name subject to change]. They do some experimentation on this machine. In fact, they discover something. This machine is a time machine.
Here begin the story, a fight to change the future by altering the past, more or less.
Now I'll explain one or two things that seem to be weird in my mind. This part contain spoilers.
As a lot of anime, Steins;Gate put some rules. And he does it very well. For example, a D-Mail is used to alter the past, and it will have the following effect: changed the actual worldline. Okabe have the reading Steiner, so when we switch between two worldline, he remember all the things about the old worldline.
To cancel the effect of a D-Mail, and so return to the initial worldline, they have to send another D-Mail, to the same person, and tell something opposite at the first D-Mail.
Okay so here's the plot hole. At the episode 22, they have to cancel the last D-Mail, which is in reality the first one: ""Makise Kurisu has been stamped"". They do that by using the IBN 5100, hacking the CERN, find this message, and... Delete it by pressing enter! Here we are. How the action of deleting the D-Mail in the present can have effect on the past? It can't, if we follow the rules of the anime. I can agree that it change the future, but it means that Makise Kurisu should be dead, and the worldline shouldn't change. The fact that we see the animation that indicates a switch of worldline isn't logic, and it's for me an inconsistence.
All others inconsistencies can be resolved in the way that it's an anime, and there's some things that we just have to admit. For example, I read on the net the following thing: when Okabe send the first D-Mail to Daru, we can‚Äôt know if the door of the microwave is open, that is necessary to get the effect of the D-Mail. Honestly‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even care. We don‚Äôt see it, so I trust that Daru do some experiences on the microwave, and leave the door open. Who cares? 
But this one can't be resolved in an easy way as this. They put rules and not respect it.
Anyway, that's why I put 8 to this anime, because it's the only thing that I was disappointed.
Characters: 10/10
From Okabe to Mr. Braun, all the characters are interesting in my mind. We have a great casting in this anime, a mad scientist, the girl who don't know anything about the science, but just follow Okabe (Mayuri), Daru which is more interested about 2D girls than 3D, Kurisu who is the little highbrow, and all the other are well defined, Suzuha Amane the ""Part time Warrior"", Moeka, ect...
For example, when Mayuri see Okarin, she always said ""tu tuluuu"", and I found it so funny!
Art: 10/10
Steins gate was published in 2010, and for this date the graphics are really good. And just the global graphics universe is... Wow I don't know how to said, but it fit really well with the theme of the show: a little bit dark when they are in the lab, even the street where the lab is, it's like the lab is a secret place.
Story: 9/10
Here‚Äôs the black point. I think this anime is the anime the most constructed that I see. You can check all the dates when Okabe change worldline, it's coherent. You can't say that the story is bad. You maybe be able to not appreciate it, but don't tell me that it's a bad story.
I don't put 10 because of this inconsistence that I underline higher in this review. And I think Steins Gate excels in the story because it's a really really big anime, with high budget. Every people have high expectations when they start to watch this anime. And there's only one inconsistence, and maybe, I search everywhere an explanation of this inconsistence but I didn't found one, but maybe there is one explanation.
The more you make something with high budget, and well wait by people, the more the public will be exigent. And Steins gate satisfy a lot of people, so they did well I think.
Sound/OST: 10/10
I'm not really an expert about the sound in anime, so I just put 10 because I like the show. But I never heard a bad music when I watch it. The openings and the endings are also very good for me, so I have no reason to critic it.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Even if I found a black point in the story, I really appreciate to watch this anime. It's one of the shows I enjoy the most. Everything is well constructed, and when I start to understand what's going on, you just want to know more things about it. There is a funny part in the anime, which is really really good because it give to the show a bit of humour.
Overall: 10/10
Steins;Gate is just a Masterpiece Anime.
If I have one advice: watch it. You HAVE TO watch it.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is easily the best anime I've ever seen!
Once I got past the slow start, the plot, characters and art kept me watching hour after hour each day. Steins;Gate is the best implementation of a time travel like anime I've seen so far. the plot stays relevant and engaging for the majority of this anime, which always kept me interested. It is really easy to get emotionally attached to the characters in this show. I never found any of them unlikable in anyway. But besides Okabe, the characters could use some more development, they could each easily be summed up in a couple of sentences.
Steins;Gate
                  is easily the best anime I've ever seen! They have nailed the time travel theme which made for an outstanding experience which always kept me on the edge of my seat. Sure, the characters are a bit under developed and it had a slow start. But i can overlook those gripes because this is easily the best anime I've ever seen... PERIOD.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is an anime with an amazing plot and very unique concept for an anime... The Story is one that you wont forget easily, one that will make you wonder about what's for the future and what there is beyond our reality.
Both the art and the sound in the anime is beautyful, the sound made me look up some great instrumentals & orchestra, a few examples of these are; ""Always in this place"", ""Hacking to the Gate"". Both of which are really good, I have listened to these multiple times after the anime.
The character development under the series is rather complicated at first, you will
                  gradually start to understand each individual character which sets for a really interesting story, at first it might not make much sense, but I assure you that you will be greatly awarded as the story progresses.
Steins;Gate is truly a complex anime, theres so much thought behind every action taken in the anime, and you cant bare looking away for over a few seconds. I recommend anyone who has a lust for adventure and thinking/problem solving to watch this anime, It is truly amazing.
10/10

                I don‚Äôt know what makes an anime good. I was expecting sooooo much more from Steins;Gate that I‚Äôm terrible frustrated (not that much) now that I finished it and it is really not all of that. The plot is reaaaaally slow paced, like nothing happens in the first 6 episodes!!! I just kept watching because 1st - people told me it‚Äôd get better around 11th episode (!!!!! - it gets better around the 9th) and 2nd - because it‚Äôs one of my items for MAL‚Äôs annual AWC, otherwise I probably wouldn‚Äôt have finished it. The anime‚Äôs first impressions are TOTALLY different from what it really
                  is. 
I think a truly GOOD show/movie/anime should catch you at least until the third episode - which is already too far away! I find unbearable to have to watch 9 episodes to POSSIBLY like the story and I won‚Äôt give it a higher score just because I liked the ending - which I didn‚Äôt. Just no. 
The inicial plot is super boring and bad developed. I think they were trying to make the public create a emotional bond with the characters, living with them, discovering new things with them, but, honestly, they failed miserably. They could‚Äôve done this in a whole bunch of different ways. The first episode gives you that thirst for mystery, but the following episodes are just a slice of life thing.
The characters are ok, like they stay in the shape the producers gave them to please everyone, there‚Äôs not much or any character development to say the least - except for Kyoma. The crazy weirdo main character followed by his perverted sidekick friend and a whole bunch of girls - a cutesy, a whispering girl and a self-empowered one. I really couldn‚Äôt see any character progression along the story. To sum up they‚Äôre just forgettable characters. I didn‚Äôt get involved emotionally with anyone on this, none of them made me relate or love.
The art is average, not too gorgeous nor appalling. It‚Äôs an ok show to watch based on its art. I just think they don‚Äôt know very well how to explore the backgrounds and scenes on sunlight are too bright. The soundtrack is good and the op is awesome! 
The first arc is EXTREMELY BORING, it‚Äôs not funny nor mysterious nor fast paced, it‚Äôs nothing but a boring slice of life of a middle age guy that thinks he‚Äôs being pursued by some ‚Äòorganization‚Äô. Did I say it was boring? Oh yes, one more time. Boring af. It‚Äôs like the producers thought they should explain the beginning of the story in order to make the viewer understand the rest that they got lost in the process and added too little information for a whole lot of episodes. Or they wanted to stay on air for two seasons. Or even they already had a big fanbase on the novel that they didn‚Äôt really care that much for the new public. I just don‚Äôt know how someone could possibly like these first episodes.
The following episodes, past the first arc, are fine to watch. They definitely weren‚Äôt that pain to watch as the first ones. But as some time travelling plots, this one gets a little repetitive. And there were lots of plot holes about the machine. The ending is terribly clich√©, something about a happy ending. Nothing unexpected. But the means they used to achieve it were good and explainable.
I had a good time watching it from episode 11th till the end, but to get through the first episodes was a real pain. I just increased my score (which was 4) because they managed somehow to put some emotion on it. This is not a show you should watch if you‚Äôre looking for a mysterious anime or a story that has a good developing pace. Far from this. If you like comedic-like or slice of life things you should go for it. I expected more.",6
"
                This anime was so great, that I decided I would write a review about it. My FIRST review. I watch quite a bit of anime, but I have never felt so much from one to decide to write one.
I'll be blunt, there were two main reasons why this show is a masterpiece. The first is the amount of connection that I felt with the characters. There were times that I almost cried and there were times where I couldn't stop smiling. I wanted to feel more of that, I wanted to feel the involvement. The connection with the characters was the key to its success.
The
                  characters weren't by any means the only reason. The story line was also superb. I started watching the show thinking, ""I bet I can find a flaw with it!"" Why? I don't know why myself.. But I continued, and the story was so complete. It was everything I wanted from a show and more. 
I love the idea of time-travel, but I believed it was too tricky to write a story about it well. I was shown that it is possible. The whole idea in Steins;Gate really worked out well. Even though I knew there were going to be some ""crazy"" moments (there usually is when talking with time-travel), there were parts where my jaw literally dropped. The things you may never imagine, could happen. That's all I feel I can say without spoilers. 
All in all, this show deserves 10/10, it's truly a masterpiece. 
********** WATCH THE MOVIE AFTER THE SERIES! IT IS WORTH IT!!!! There's things in the movie that will clear up any discrepancy about the anime, and make you say out loud, ""Oh my God, that was genius.""",10
"
                For me this anime is what everyone should start with. It was my 2nd anime and essentially what made me stick with anime for good.It is an amazing show for every Sci-Fi fan out there.The story is fully developed with amazing characters, all of them being original and not plain and predictable.The story is entertaining and with its knots and twists,which are essential for a time traveling flick.
The story revolves around a wannabe scientist who,with the help of his friends,accidentally create a time machine which has the ability to change the past by sending tiny bits of information in the past.
The show is excellent for
                  beginners as it has an easy to understand and follow,but still entertaining enough story.I would recommend this anime to everyone who likes the time traveling stories,or is just starting up in the awesome world of anime.",10
"
                First of all i have to say that i haven't written a post here for some time, i didn't really felt like it. But after finishing Steins Gate i just had to write here something about this Masterpiece.
There is one thing i can surely tell you guys, this is a anime series i will never forget in my whole life, the anime, the characters, the music, the emotions...everything will remain, forever, in every timeline i will leap to.
Story: 10/10
I can't write much about the story itself, because every part of the story i just mention would ruin the series for someone who didn't watch this
                  yet (you simply have to watch this if you haven't) because every single part of this Masterpiece is important, it has a meaning why they show it. The series had parts that are funny, weird, scary, disturbing, just wtf, interesting, action filled and and and...and that all was necessary for this series to be complete, everything had its part in the story and stands for something.
After watching the first few episodes you start getting involved in the story, it makes you start thinking about the things that happened, things that happen and things that could happen and that makes it so interesting and exciting when you guess something right or totally wrong, it just amazes you so damn much that you get hyped by the anime.
It's just like you are part of the story yourself, you feel what the characters feel, you try to guess what's going on and you think about a solution for the problems that occur. This feelings i just described, i never felt that way in any other anime series, ok...i haven't watched that much anime, but still, i think this anime deserves such a score on MAL (just saw the rating there, didn't knew it till i finished the series).
Characters: 10/10
The first reason i give it a 10 is because i found my new favorite character in this series, i totally fell for the character and i think it will be really hard to find a new favorite one that is better than this one.
The second reason is that this anime doesn't have much characters but the characters were so different from each other that i couldn't believe it, it simply amazed me.
There is a childish scientist, a fat hacker, a air headed girl, a genius beauty tsundere, a ""unknown gender"" one, a mad manager and salesman, a girl addicted to her phone and really ""shy"", one that is nothing like ""shy""...well...so many different people in one place and synced so damn good, almost like it's impossible to put them together that well...but it happened :D
Animation: 9/10
At first i didn't really paid much attention to the animation of the anime, but later on i saw that they pay attention to many things to make the atmosphere just like it should be, the combination of the music and the animation was really great, the looks of the characters synced with their personalities - that's a thing i really value in anime, cause i know it's not easy to make something to work together that great.
Music: 9/10
Just wanted to tell that i fell in love with the Opening theme, it's such a great Opening, it should be in every TOP anime Op list on YouTube!
About the background music, i already wrote a bit in the ""Animation"" part about it so i will save that.
Closing words:
I can say that this anime found a place in my heart, it's for sure in my top 5 anime list, because i feel like i experienced so much while watching this, i felt so much pain, love, confusion but also happiness and joy. I already miss the series, i feel like i wanna watch it again right away...i already watched the special episode and the movie cause i couldn't live with the fact that i finished the story.
Sorry i got carried away with the writing a bit xD It's not me...it's my inner me drown in feelings!",10
"
                Honestly blows my mind that this is one of the highest rated anime on the website. Steinsgate has possibly the worst cast of characters I have seen in an anime, one dimensional forgettable characters that are insanely unlikeable especially the protagonists who is insufferable. The concept seems kinda interesting but the plot moves at such a snails pace with such boring characters that I'm not willing to spend hours of my time waiting for the payoff (assuming there is any) 
When it comes to the visuals and music the show is pretty average and the voice acting for the dub is serviceable but nothing 
                  memorable. If you are looking for a good sci-fi anime there are much better offerings that have better characters and less filler.",4
"
                Simple, Minimal, time travel done right!
We are all idiots when it comes to time travel physics and the time space continuum but Steins Gate's concept of time travel is quite simple and relative to understand. 
Story - (9/10)
The story itself is well detailed by using real world tech terms like MYSQL and IBN(IBM), instead of other anime that just show a black terminal and have a character type away. 
Short Summary: Okabe, a self proclaimed mad scientist and his crew(Future Gadgets) have successfully created a time machine out of a microwave and a cellphone just for fun!. Little did they know, the fate of the
                  earth could depend on their ""fun"" experiments. Struggle by struggle, they try to alter fate, but will they succeed? 
Character - (9/10)
They were kinda cliched, I mean, you got the 
-Tsundere who is disappointed about her bust size
-The innocent bystander who is just there for the main character to push forward
-Energetic Childish main character who forms a harem.
I really hate the character Feyris and her constant ""NYAN~""ing.
Strong females (Suzuha and Mayurii) are my two favorite of the series.
Art&Sound-(10/10)
I do not rate art and sound because I do not have the right to criticize as I only can draw stick figures and play no instruments. Not to mention.... its subjective as hell...
Compliments: Sound matched the anime pretty well.
Overall-(9/10)
Damn simple time travel that even a 10 year old could understand
-Strong plot twists(AMAZING)
-Strong Mystery
[SPOILER AHEAD]
What was keeping this from getting a 10/10?
IBN also known in real life as IBM is an american company. Instead of going through 2-3 episodes trying to find one, they could have just flew to america and get 1.
The main character took too long to realize he had nakama... about 3-5 episodes, it kinda was frustrating. It is ""realistic"" but frustrating...
Missing scenes from its original source that would have been interesting
I don't like harem...",9
"
                Have you ever pondered the eternal philosophical question: What happens when you put a banana in a microwave with a tray table that rotates counterclock-wise?. Believe it or not, this is the central theme of the entire anime. (This is not truly a spoiler as it happens as early as episode 2). Either this will intrigue you into watching, or repulse you, and you should trust your initial response to that question. 
Story: 10/10
I don't really like the official blurb you see when you read about this anime, as it has nothing really to do with anything. The story has an interesting hook, good development,
                  a few twists, and that's really all that's important. I reiterate, either the hook in ep 2 will grab you or it won't. If it does, you are in for a good time. 
Art: 9/10
Overall, it is decent. It does not detract from the story in any way. That said, there are many animes with better art than this one. 
Sound: 9/10
Similarly, the sound is decent. It in no way detracts from the story, and it helps at key moments, but it is not a reason to watch this anime over any others. 
Characters 10/10
Hero- While there are many great protagonists in anime, he is in my top 25 somewhere.
Heroine- Foils with the protagonist very well. It makes for a great 1-2.
Other pseduo-main characters- There are very few weak characters on this show. Almost any character that gets an episode devoted to them, is usually a strong, powerful episode worth watching. 
Enjoyment 10/10:
I laughed, a lot during this anime. Probably the most of any anime other than Gintama. But the show has its serious moments that are also profound and moving. It really covers the entertainment spectrum on all angles. 
Overall 10/10:
There are no factors which detract from the enjoyment of this show, and many good reasons to watch it. When watching it, at least give it until the end of the second episode before giving up on it.",10

                *This Review Contains Spoilers*
So....
This anime isn¬¥t my Number 1 anime of all time without reason.
What made me pick this for Number 1 out of the more than hundred anime I¬¥ve seen?  The one, most OUTSTANDING thing that made me watch the series in 3 days, is the AMAZING atmosphere every episode delivers. One moment there¬¥s an incredibly funny moment, like a new over the top theory by Okabe, or his hilarious laugh, the other moment the atmosphere is umbelievably creepy, like when okabe recieves a photo from the evil group trying to prevent him from discovering any more with his experiments. What also brought
                  some eerieness or creepiness into the series were the experiments that okabe worked out, like sending messages into the past or changing the past little by little. Experiments go on and on, Okabe gets deeper and deeper into different mysterious worlds and soon you realize: Nothing is impossible in this story. Okabe desperately tries to prevent certain events and you really feel helpless as well. Steins;Gate really drags you into the story and makes you empathize with each and every character. At one point, Okabe seems to have given up hope and looks on the brink of insanity, but his slightly different friends help him up again and okabe and Makise develop an also very well done romance, which also gives a lot of spice to the episodes.  A lot of people say that they don¬¥t like how the story starts off slowly. I disagree, since -boom- right at the beginning there¬¥s a murder scene. Second, I also like how the story ""slowly- but acceleratingly"" the story starts off with Okabe¬¥s ""normal"" life with his friends and what he usually does. Despite this, you can see the gears turning on the story line and I could immediately tell this show would be a good one. Also very outstanding in Steins;Gate, is how ""professional"" the scenes are written, cut and displayed. The timing is just perfect and the angles and soundeffects fit perfectly. If you¬¥re wondering if you should watch it dubbed or subbed, look no further. The sub is obviously the original and some people prefer it, BUT- I watched the Dub which was the best I have ever heard. Now, I do prefer dub normally, because I¬¥m american, but sometimes the dubs of shows are really trashy, so I watch subbed too. You definitely won¬¥t regret Steins;Gate¬¥s dub, least said. The characters in this show are all very well done, each of their backstory being shown, since Okabe uncovers shocking truth after truth of how much his life has, is and will be influenced by his friends. The storyline can get a little confusing at times, but that¬¥s what this anime is about: ""A whole bunch of confusing time lines that Okabe travels through, to reach a destiny where he can be together happily with all his friends."" After all, this anime IS about time traveling. Coming to the animation, I have to say there¬¥s not really anything that stood out. The art style is relatively realistic as can be said for the shading, lighting and colours. The animation is very fitting for this scientific masterpiece, which makes my overall respect for Steins;Gate even greater. This anime completely annhilated any other anime in all categories and got me addicted very quickly. It definitely deserves the Number 1 spot in my top anime list of all time!",10

                *Anime Legends- Part 1*
 Preface- 
 	I watched all of Steins;Gate in the course of 2 or 3 days. And when I finished the OVA, I felt a void inside myself, that only appears after I finish experiencing a piece of art the way exemplary in many ways than one. Steins;Gate for a while before I ended up marathoning it, I thought that it would never live up to the colossal amount of hype and praise it had, but boy was I wrong. Not only did S;G live up to my expectations but it actually far surpassed them. This is a sort of review series
                  that I want to start doing where I review any anime series which I consider at the very least superb in much greater detail than I do in my other reviews. And I feel like I need to experience the show at least twice, to be able to compose my thoughts well enough to warrant such a high rating, and to be able to write a review that doesn‚Äôt sound like it was ripped off a S;G fanboy‚Äôs livejournal. With that out of the way, let‚Äôs start this bad boy.
Story: 10/10
	Self-proclaimed mad scientist Hououin Kyouma AKA ‚ÄúOkabe Rintarou‚Äù along with the other members of Future Gadgets lab create a phone microwave that can send emails to the past and along the way they unravel an organization's mysteries while working further and further till they hit a point in time where they can‚Äôt return to their easy going and safe lives. S;G plot makes absolutely no sense when you first start watching it, and most people argue that the show doesn‚Äôt get amazing until it hits the second half which I have to respectfully disagree with. On my first viewing I found the first half confusing and a little slow, but on my second viewing I perceived it as a precious safe time where characters I grew extremely fond of are able to interact and grow without any impending evil abstract or not. I viewed it as a calm before the storm, and it seemed like it was a necessity in order for use to grow attached to these characters enough that the second half could be more impactful. When this drastic change occurs it feels like a new show, but at the same time it stills feels like S;G. There are a lot of shows involving time travel that barely get into the science or the purposed science my time travel and its mechanics, but S;G really goes a step further than most. It‚Äôs insane how the main plot point throughout the whole series is the mechanics of time travel, and how they are able to get so many different interesting and heartbreaking plot lines revolving around this concept. Many people consider ‚ÄúYour Lie In April‚Äù to be a really sad show, but I was way more emotionally invested in Steins;Gate, YLIA is like a cakewalk compared to S;G. Some of the character monologues especially Mayuri‚Äôs was heartbreaking, anything that involved her grandmother and her childhood past endeared me to her even more. The Story seems pretty ridiculous and nonsensical at the beginning but the puzzle pieces slowly start to fit together in extremely satisfying ways, ultimately giving the viewer the knowledge to understand everything they didn‚Äôt when they first started. The replay value knowing this is huge, my second viewing was almost just as satisfying as the first time around (though I marathoned the whole show faster the second time).
Characters: 10/10
Rintarou Okabe also known as Okarin-
 	A self proclaimed mad scientist and the lab member number 1, Okabe is quite the enigma when you are first introduced to him. He acts in a cheesy, over the top, and theatrical matter a lot of the time to emphasize his mad scientist alter ego, and while it was a little grating and first I really came to appreciate the amount of work it took for him at times to put that act make on for his friends in need. He talks in a very scientific and verbose manner, and most of the characters are still able to sort of understand what he‚Äôs always getting at. You can help but to root for him with his over confident and narcissistic acts, that anchored by humble and sweet acts of kindness and goodwill. The struggle and journey that only Okabe is able to endure was heartbreaking due to the fact that it had to be him, and when come to the realization its culminates in one of the most moving moments of all of S;G. His constant bickering with the lab members always brings a smile to my face, since for the most part it's always in good fun, and I just love seeing all these characters interacting with each other. Okabe is for sure one of my top 10 favorite anime characters of all time (though not number 1, read on to find out who that is).
Kurisu Makise-
 	 Christina, Assistant, the Zombie, the list goes on, but there isn‚Äôt really a nickname apt to describe Kurisu‚Ä¶.tsundere perhaps? Anyways Kurisu is a scholored award winning 18 year old scientist who runs into Okabe at her father‚Äôs lecture. She then follows Okabe back to the Future Gadgets Lab where she learns of the incredible invention Okabe and Daru (Itaru Hashida), have stumbled through. She is an incredibly likeable character while at times cold on the outside and sarcastic she has a heart of gold and an interest in the most nerdy of entertainment. She loves to test out a good hypothesis, and she lets her curiosity get the best of her a few times throughout the series. Her character design is extremely memorable and fashion forward plus her trademark spunky attitude really leaves you with a great impression of her after the series is over. I love how much she warms up to all the members of Future Gadget Lab as the series progress, and her feuds with Okabe can be hysterical. She is my favorite character of S;G, and maybe even my favorite character in all of anime. 	
Mayuri Shiina-
‚ÄúTuturu~Tuturu~Tuturu~Tuturu~Tuturu‚Ä¶‚Äù
 	Mayuri is a little ball of positivity and warmth that should be taken hostage and treasure for years to come. Her voice in the dub is so adorable and unique that when I tried to watch the S;G movie subbed I just couldn't do it, it just feels wrong with a different voice cast. She is pretty much the opposite of Okabe in many ways, but their relationship and love for each other couldn't be stronger. She has a keen focus for the bigger picture. She can makes friends with just about anyone, in no time flat because of inviting and innocent she tends to seem. Her cosplaying hobby was pretty original in my eyes, in fact Steins;Gate feels like an incredibly modern anime despite the fact that it's now five years old. She may not be as an intelligible when it comes to science, but Mayuri knows people better than anyone, and she could tell that something was wrong with okarin despite barely talking to him for a lot of the second half. She is a very sweet character, who doesn‚Äôt grow too much by series end, but what little changes there were, were very vital nonetheless. 
Itaru Hashida-
 	Hack extraordinaire Daru, is a well meaning, smart, otaku. He partakes in the finer things in life such as maid cafes and visual novels. He is the third lab member, and is essential to their main mission. I would say that if there was a comedic relief character in the show it would be Daru, his perverted jokes and advances are hilarious and while you‚Äôd think that jokes about the texture of bananas or squeezing large objects into tight spaces, these immature sexual innuendos are just the best. He does have some character development due to the introduction of newer lab members, though I feel like he wasn‚Äôt enough in this original series and that hopefully he will have a more vital role in Stein;Gate 0 overall. Just so many of the supporting lab members get whole one or two episodes about them, but Daru gets nothing of the sort which is a real shame.
Ruka Urushibara-
 	‚ÄòDelicate as an orchid, fair as a cherry blossom, the personification of feminine grace, and a dude. Tall as a willow, slender as a reed, a dude.‚Äù -Okabe
 	 An apt though hilarious in context description of Ruka, who is my favorite side character though her and Suza are neck and neck. Her humbleness and honesty are admirable, though pretty unconfident and unsure of himself. Ruka is a delightful character and a great teammate with Okabe. Also  one scene I found really infuriating or cringe worthy was when Okabe was trying to figure out his gender, and there were so many better ways he could have gone about it (people that have seen the series, you guys know what I‚Äôm talking about).
The Art Style/ Animation: 9/10
 	White Fox did a fantastic job overall my translating the VN by making it feel like the story envisioned in this adaption feels like the one true ending. The way they structure the plot makes it feel like it wouldn't have worked if it branched off at any point. I love how they adapted the character designs and prefer them to what I saw of the VN character models. The overall animation is good when it needs to be, but much of the show and plot involves dialogue and monologues where there is little going on on the screen but lip movements. At times when the show has a fourth wall breaking moment when he‚Äôs introducing the lab members or when he‚Äôs running back to the lab from the supermarket to make sure Mayuri is safe, show a distinct flare and visual style though if they did this for every scene those little moments and special effects would feel less unique and valuable. I love most of the character designs, and the metropolis they live in looks realistic enough and feels like a living breathing city, White Fox did their job with the series quite well, but they could have gone above and beyond more though it is more of a nitpick than anything.
Sound: 10/10
The Dub-
 	Before the I watched the commentary on the Steins;Gate Blu Ray I never realized how much work went into dubbing an anime. Before I never really thought much about I guess I just assumed that they would directly translate the Japanese and script and just record dialogue from that. The amount of work the scriptwriters for the dub put into S;G is commendable, and they made so much more relevant and accessible to an American Audience. They added a plethora of sci-fi and internet culture, that was a joy to notice every once in awhile. Also I hate that the the quote on the bluray calls this like a mash up of ‚ÄúThe Big Bang Theory‚Äù and ‚ÄúDonnie Darko‚Äù. BBT is an insufferable comedy, pandering to the general audience, by just making a reference to something nerdy without having a punchline. The references made In S;G are mostly used for a comedic effect especially when they are teasing Kurisu who is embarrassed by her hidden internet meme queen nature. I can ever listen to a different voice for Okabe, Kurisu, & Mayuri, this  dub is incredible and should be seen as an example of a good dub.
The Opening Theme-
The trippy and robotic imagery really fit the show‚Äôs plot to a tee. Many important events are foreshadowed in the opening, Some of the imagery is actually a bit haunting like the numerous huddled bodies or the multiple Okabe's walking together. I love how it also spotlights all the members of the lab (except Daru which is a little lame but whatever). The part where camera whirls around kurisu and multiple versions of her start to appear and go flashing by is mesmerising (and is the first gif I found, which I actually made to put onto my profile). The song gets you hyped for the show, I love the electronic beats and chiptune flairs that pop up every once in awhile. And the high point of the music where it climaxes at ‚ÄúHacking to the Gate‚Äù is bliss for my ears. The song sounds pretty harsh and metallic, but at the same time feels really catchy and inviting. Again the lyrics foreshadow much to come in the series, which I love about it how integral it is, and how S;G is the only piece of art/entertainment that I could associate the song with.
The Ending Theme-
 	The piece is a pretty melancholic and does its job well of calming down the viewer after the cliffhanger or plot climax the just witnessed. Though the song is still bursting with emotions and anguish pleading with the cruel mistress of time. There isn't as much to talk about compared to the opening but I still thoroughly enjoy this ending theme.
Enjoyment- (AKA: TL;DR): 10/10
‚ÄúBalls or not I would so hit that.‚Äù -Daru
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an intellectual drink, for the chosen ones.‚Äù -Okabe about Dr. Pepper
‚ÄúSmall boobies will have their day.‚Äù -Mayuri
	Steins;Gate is a once in a lifetime type of show that is leagues above its peers in most aspects and I am truly jealous of anyone who hasn't experienced this world yet, because they are able to see it with fresh new eyes. The show may start off slow, but it once it transitions it hits the viewer like the brick, and you won't able to stop watching for anything. The story is a lot more complicated and meaningful than a lot of television shows I‚Äôve seen, the characters are A+, and Openings and Endings serves their purpose very well. I didn‚Äôt talk at all about it in this review, but the rest of the soundtrack many electronic and piano pieces are also splendid, though I‚Äôm not sure if I would listen to them without the visual accompaniment. Overall Steins;Gate is my favorite anime of all time, hell even possibly my favorite tv show of all time, and I hope that I was able to explain my thoughts to you guys coherently enough for you to understand where I‚Äôm coming from.",10
"
                Chaos Theory; A subject of much speculation & fascination. Most everything related to time, space & its very fabric is incomprehensible to most and hence the easiest subject for fictional writers to screw up. There is just so much to make sure of as a writer when it comes to topics like time travel given the unpredictable nature of the subject itself , the margin of error is very fine..
But then here we have Steins;Gate,  Chiyomaru Shikura,5pb & Nitropluses brainchild that manages to tie all the loose ends that may have been possible along with managing to constantly managing to keep it's audience at
                  the edge of their seats..
The story follows Okabe Rintarou, an 18 year old self-proclaimed mad scientist who, along with the few friends he has, rents a room to open up his so-called lab.
Nothing much happens until they tweak a microwave to turn bananas into jelly. They have no idea of the groundbreaking capabilities it possesses until genius neuro-science researcher Makise Kurisu catches a glimpse of it and apparently, it has the ability to send objects onto the past, including text messages.. 
From there on the story takes the viewers through several tight corners, twists & turns at breakneck speed. However, that doesn't mean that it doesn't take its  own sweet time to get going. The first 6-7 episodes are excruciatingly slow but it all roars to life during this one particular scene at the end of episode 9 when Okabe realizes the gravity of what happens when one tries to change the past.
I know, it has been done a thousand times before.
But if you can overlook that (which you probably can) you'll realize that Steins;Gate has way more to present than a 'picnic to the past' trip √° la 'Back to the Future' as it covers the topic of internal conflict, predicaments regarding lives of loved ones & of course, most importantly,the threat of a a sinister organization that seeks such technology for all the wrong reasons..
Steins;Gate is all about how Okabe manages all of these looming threats and how he manages to get out of them with the help of his 'side-kick' and romantic interest, Makise Kurisu.
You see while the show keeps you bored, showing you nothing during the first seven episodes, it sneakily gets you attached to it's quirky characters. And they are very likeable indeed. In fact, the first seven episodes are just a mere setup of what s to come..
To say that Okabe is slightly eccentric would be a massive understatement, at first he sounds like a whack job: repeatedly picking up phone calls that aren't there, constantly blabbering on about a non-existent evil organisation that doesn't exist. But while he is slightly delusional what he also is is brilliant. The reason why you should care more about him is because he is blessed with an ability to keep his memories from other alternate pasts absolutely intact. 
Makise Kurisu, along with being highly intelligent, is much more calm, collected and (due to a lack of a better way to put it) normal. She may not fully know what's going on, but is smart enough to understand and act accordingly. She doesn't need to experience what went on in other world lines to come up with some very handy solutions that are key to solving these problems and she doesn't exist only to be Okabe's romantic interest.
The other female protagonist; Shiina Mayuri is the exact opposite. She is still very childlike in her behaviour and in her thoughts. She serves the purpose of being Okabe's childhood friend and also being a plot device. 
Other characters consists of a fat perverted hacker, the silent chick, a cheerful part timer, a trap & a maid. All of them, when together create some pretty decent humour when they are not busy in correcting and over-correcting the past. But I can promise you this that none of these characters are wasted. 
What helps these characters is Brilliant voice acting, everyone has their own very unusual traits but never do they sound over the top. Each character is perfectly well realized and delivers their dialogue with utmost sincerity, making them sound honest & unpretentious. 
The soundtrack is brilliant as well, Electronic rock meets J-Pop. The opening is quite catchy itself but the ending is astounding; despite sounding dark, mysterious & somber captures almost every mood the show goes through. 
My only lament about the sound in Steins;Gate is that it doesn't use its lack of background music in a lot of situations. I understand that it is more of an artistic choice but it could have done with a bit more of that given that most background scores in this show are brilliant.
The art is great as well even though at times characters literally look like flat, rectangular objects and at other times characters look slightly ill-proportioned.
Another thing that slightly annoys me is the constant white,blinding light that the artists have going during the day. It's safe to say that Steins;Gate shines most when in the dark (or indoors for that matter).
I have absolutely no complaints on the animation front however, of course there aren't a whole lot of action scenes but animation is fluid and seamless nonetheless.
Overall, Steins;Gate does a very good job of making it's world look,sound and feel as alive as possible.
TL;DR
S;G twists & turns like a rollercoaster that it is, taking Okabe (and the viewers of course) through incredible highs and lows all while constantly creating empathy for him & his friends. The characters are written in such a way that even the so-called 'villains' are worthy of their own share of sympathy. 
Of course there aren't a whole lot of action scenes but S;G is certainly action-packed. It balances it's action-thriller elements along with a dash of comedy & romance all while based on the delicate subject of space-time. To put it simply; Steins;Gate is a thriller masterpiece and anyone who gets past the 7th episode will be thoroughly rewarded..
                                                                                                                     OVERALL:10/10",10

                Time travel is awesome whether you understand how it's done or confused by it either way it's entertaining.
Steins; Gate follows this 18 year old self-proclaimed mad scientist named Rintaro Okabe, aka Okarin who tries to accomplish the goal of time travel and appears paranoid and delusional. After witnessing a murder he sends a text message about the murdered person and that causes him to send that text 5 days into the past and the murdered victim is alive and later joins them. They use the time machine to send different text messages into the past and eventually leads to dire consequences. After witnessing his friends
                  death he tries to save her, but every time he tries to change the past the same thing happens. So he travels through time to undo the text messages they have sent through the time machine delete them and return everything to back to normal. *Also would like to mention the time machine is a microwave.
The characters make this show. Every character is very well-developed and the relationships they have are great. The characters draw your attention away from all the interesting, yet confusing concept of time travel. The other four main characters besides Okarin are all memorable. Mayuri is a childhood friend of Okabe and she is always optimistic and happy. Daru who is a hacker and otaku. Finally there is Kurisu is an 18 year old neuroscientist from an American university who joins Okabe and his group as they try to prove how the time machine works. Also the relationship between Okabe and Kurisu is hilarious.
Stiens; Gate is an incredible show that has slight flaws in it, but overall it is one hell of an anime. It has drama, suspense, and sci-fi that will have you entertained throughout the course of this anime and it is truly a masterpiece.",10
"
                ATTENTION: I will review Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0 as a whole even though they might differ in tone a bit
Steins;Gate is a time travel show that goes way past that, it's a slow-paced well-built masterpiece that I've watched in 1 day and a half (50 or so episodes) just so you can see how hooked I became to this amazing perspective on time traveling and this captivating environment that it offers us.
Story 10/10
     The story told is about a group of friends that live in Akihabara (Tokyo) and have a rented apartment used as a Lab, they discover that it's possible
                  to change the timelines by sending messages to the past due to the butterfly effect. The story progresses at the typical snowballing pace, and it gets constantly more anxious and despairing as the main character tries to keep things together. It has some of the greatest plot that I've ever seen in any time travel show and anime overall, maybe the only one comparable to this in this aspect would be Code Geass. 
     There are a ton of little references and cool skits all around the story, for example some mention about ""Back to the Future"" and ""A Girl who Lept trough Time"", as for skits it has a really good one right in the first episode where the main character sort of breaks the 4th wall when talking to a TV cartoon, provoking him to show evidence on how he could prove that his world is more real than theirs, this helps setting the theme of the show to this kind of philosophycal thinking from the very start. The big reference, and the one that connects the show to the real world is John Titor, a forum user in the year 2000 that proclaimed to be a real time traveler (true story), Steins;Gate simply played around with this story, bringing up everything it spoke about: the IBN-1500, the 3rd World War, etc...
     It's the first anime that I've seen that just takes this time concept and applies it realisticaly to the point where you can never think of it as just another fantasy but a hypothesis that could be worked on in our world.
Art 9/10
    I'm already going to say this: In reality Steins;Gate is not really an 9 out of 10 in Art Style, it doesn't compare to Violet Evergarden or Kizumonogatari, HOWEVER, I think it's a 9 out of 10 for what it serves: a more serious/realistic art style for a more serious/realistic anime. I don't think I would like to see Steins;Gate with that generic anime art that you see dropping every season, it would just ruin the charm. And what brings all that charm together is the use of the color palette, by using blue tones when the story is relating more to the past and yellow colors to when its relating to the future, white being the color of the balance between both, the color of hououin kyouma's silvery armor that is his lab coat, the symbol of the Steins;Gate worldline.
Sound 9/10
     The openings are really good and the endings aswell although not as much, the robotic tone in the singer's voice fits the anime just right. Speaking on background music, there are a lot of tracks that go along side each scene type just like a visual novel, you have the typical comedical track, the day track, the night park track etc... but there's this especial one, ""Believe Me"", that has a lot of variations: the original one, which is used a lot during the first part of Steins;Gate in reflecting/sad moments, the bad one: used in Steins;Gate 0, it sounds really off, but it's purposeful, since this second season it's supposed to happen in the bad timeline, it somehow makes me sadder than the already sad original track, and then theres the last version, the epic one, vocals and violins come in, used as a leitmotif during the most important parts. This combination really packs a punch and will make the music not leave your head for the next weeks. Also, ""SkyClad Observer"" is the most heroic Insert Song that I've experienced, appearing in only two moments during Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0 but those are the momentes that will make you grin from ear to ear.
     The voice acting is also really good especially on Hououin Kyouma with that goofy tone to his voice that makes him what he is.
Character 10/10
      Oh this is it! This is what makes Steins;Gate the best show I've ever seen! The characters and how layered they are, everyone wears a mask in this show: Suzuha hiding that she's John Titor, Rukako and the unconfortability with his gender, Moeka and her blind dependency, Faris pretending not to have dramas and only showing the e-girl side, Maho holding her obsession with Kurisu, Daru and his hidden schemes, Mr. Braum pretending to be just a CRT-TV enjoyer, etc... 
      The most important characters in this aspect are Okabe, Kurisu and Mayuri without a doubt:
      - Okabe Rintarou: The best main character I've met, he is both Okabe Rintarou and Hououin Kyouma, the latter one being a persona that he has made to entertain Mayuri, a mad scientist destined to rule the world while being cautious with the organization. So Okabe's main character in Steins;Gate is this so said mad scientist that just goofs around and has a lot of chuunibyou traits, but he is not just a clingy typical chuunibyou, he represents the hope left in Okabe's heart once things go downhill, the one Kurisu and Mayuri fell in love, the savior of the world from distopia, we can see how cold the show gets once he disappears in Steins;Gate 0, and that's why we love when he returned to us to fulfill his mission.
      - Makise Kurisu: Kurisutina is sort of the counterpart to Mayuri in the fact that she represents a safe future where the 3rd world war doesn't exist. She starts by being a tsundere but as the show progresses and Okabe enters despair she starts being present in his worst moments, she can't understand him as well as Mayuri does, but she can help him better since they are both scientists and can relate to stuff that Mayurii just couldn't. It's the moral support that's allways there for when Okabe time travels, the safe and reliable source that we want to see at the end of the day.
      - Mayuri Shiina: Mayushii is a special character in this universe, she doesn't have any sort of mask, she is pure and innocent, and represents all that is about Okarin's past, she knows him really well and is the first one to notice how he is starting to get distant, unfortunatly she is hesitant about making him open up to her since she doesn't really understand what's going on in the lab. She is the respresentation of emotions, the one that doesn't like anybody to fight or to suffer in silence, the one that is allways welcoming and cheerfull, empathyzing with everyone.
Enoyment 10/10 
      Best anime I've ever seen, since I liked the characters from the very start not even the ""filler"" episodes were a worry for me. Steins;Gate will not dissapoint and Steins;Gate 0 will get really good and be worth the really slow paced beggining. Once you watch this masterpiece it's hard to enjoy anime again.

                Steins;Gate was just purely amazing. The whole series is just FABULOUS. Mainly, the anime focus much on plot, it actually isn't so confusing as I might have thought. Although it says about Time travel, it actually isn't fully Time travelling, there is a lot of things happening when they are not time travelling.One good example would be the Romance between Okabe and Makise. 
Lets talk about the Story before we move on to the Romance. The story mainly focus on ""Time travelling""  while Okabe is a eccentric character, it brings us a lot of entertaining, amusing us at the moment.The story itself isn't confusing(Maybe
                  to some) I think it was well planned like when they time travel they would kind of return back so we wouldn't be confused with the past and future. So I rated the story 10/10 outsanding. A lot of anime wouldn't have their Story Outstanding. In a sense that it is quite hard. Now thats the Story strong point. I love how the plot goes, smooooooooothly :3 
Art was quite good, I like how Okabe hair looks like. Muahaha, Makise hair looks red and smooth love the cute appearance of her. Okabe looks quite cool too. I think the art quality was perfect, The moment when Okabe time traveled, some thing flashed, the timer and all that. We could actually see that Okabe SUCCESSFULLY change the past. Which makes it separate from when it did change and not change. So it is 10/10 love the character design.
The sound would be 10/10 I think each sound fits perfectly for each character, Okabe would have a weird and eccentric tone, which would be perfect. Makise would be someone who is very smart and would have tons of knowledge. Mayuri has a kind personality, the sound for it is soft and gentle fits totally. Urushibara is a boy hahaha but of course he resemble and sound like a girl, I totally though that it was a girl when I first saw him, the art and sound does it a lot.10/10
Enjoyment.. I was very satisfied and enjoyed this WHOLE ANIME. It was really a masterpiece, to be honest when we just read the whole plot without seeing the anime, I would be quite confused and just forget about it and move on to another anime. I did that to Steins;gate but for some reason I just wanted to try some random anime, and went back to my list and watched Steins;gate. To my surprise, it was out of my EXPECTATION. Not confusing at ALL. Enjoyed really.. I really enjoyed, regretted my choice of not watching this earlier. It made it up to my favorite anime list.
Overall I think this anime was great and deserve a perfect score. Ending was a good one, returning with all the dear ones to Okabe. Entering a new world line which was with no disaster but still returning to a happy life. Makise x Okabe FTW!! I loved the romance ! Especially when Makise sacrificed herself and told Okabe to save Mayuri. And had a scene involved both of them That was so KYAAAAA :@ And Okabe saving Makise, Makise was brave enough to get himself hurt, my goodness.That was thrilling. Nonetheless, Makise returned safely with Okabe.

                For a long time I've watched animes with the most fuzzy plots and different kinds of characters. But Steins;Gate, a ""old season anime"" for the time I'm writting this, really got me. The sci-fi based plot and the development of the main characters relations throught the story slowly takes you and make an awesome climax. 
Beautiful arts and awesome opening/ending songs will make u love this anime the first time you watch. Enjoy
Ps: From the beginning you can think the anime is too slow but just watch the 10 first episodies. I bet you can't stop after this xD

                The past, the present and the future. The time machine is the talk of the century and many movies were created based on time traveling but no one could master the art of telling a time traveling story more than Setins;Gate! This masterpiece takes you to a world where a ""Mad scientist"" is involved in time traveling actions. Not only this masterpiece has a mix of suspense and excitement and sometimes comedy but the characters involved in this series are so interesting and every single one of them has a deep story that will be discovered through this anime continuation.
overall score 10/10 a truly masterpiece!

                And this is the perfect example of a great anime.
STORY
The build-up, the complexity while not going overboard, the always understandable but always surprising progression of the plot, the proper wrap-up (I looove animes with endings),... It's unbelievable! And don't even get me started on the kinda-double-ending... Absolute 10.
CHARACTERS
All have simple enough pasts, which allowed the focus to shift to their development, and there was a lot of it. Their design and appearance was flawless. They had no unrealistic features (Faris hair/eyes aside... I'm assuming it was just part of her maid persona), but all of them still managed to be extremely visually distinctive. Another 10.
ART
Very
                  fitting for the story. It was a sort of 'blunt reality' style. All muted colours, little contrast in the scenery (though plenty between scenes) and bleakness with spots of almost-beauty. I think some locations and moments would have benefited from slightly stronger colours and contrast, but the vast majority of them were spot on. Probably 9 (going on 10).
MUSIC
A-ma-zing opening (I specially loved the change of lyrics when a specific something in the story changed...) and a great ending. The episodes themselves had very little music but, even though this and a variety of well placed sound effects contributed to that 'blunt reality' style, I still think a soundtrack would have done certain scenes some good. Even so, what little music was used was very good. Taking into account that my words are not doing the amazingness of that opening justice... It still is a 9 (near 8).
ENJOYMENT
The first 9 or so episodes seemed to be a bit on the slow side. They were still very good, just not amazing. Then s**t went down on episode 12 and it got amazing. And then a million tons of s**t went down on episode 22 and it got perfect. But because of those first episodes, even though the whole thing is more than worth it... It's a 9.
Overall, truly and arithmetically, Steins;Gate is a great, 9 out of 10, well-worth-the-watch anime.",9

                ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs feelings are memories that transcend time‚Äù -Kurisu Makise [Steins;Gate]
Those were the first words that made me realize, that I had fell in love with Steins;Gate, I know there has been much debate as to why Steins;Gate is considered to be such a masterpiece, but honestly I can‚Äôt say it is, because then you would have created a narrow-minded view/perspective of what a masterpiece should be, I believe that if an anime manages to evoke emotion within the viewer whether it be one of frustration or of happiness and leaves you wanting more. It did a bloody good job, now for the review.
Story: 10/10
Steins;Gate is
                  about a  ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù named Okabe Rintarou who addresses himself as Hououin Kyouma who is the founder of The Future Gadget Laboratory which he manages with his friends Daru and Mayuri, they intermittently create unique devices, that are actually of little worth, until Okabe accidentally sent a text message to Darus‚Äô cellphone that is attached to their prized invention, The Phone Microwave which is undergoing a test run, subsequently Okabe manages to send a text message into the past informing Daru of an incident a few days prior to its happening. This is where the anime gets OMFG! Okabe then realizes the huge impact that tampering with time can cause after a few experiments have been run. To make matters worse he then comes in contact with an evil organization called SERN who wants to misuse his invention, Okabe is now forced to out run from SERN in order to protect his friends and invention. Steins;Gate started of pretty slow for me, I  thought it was unassuming, overrated series, but when the anime hit episode 9 and revealed why it placed so much emphasis on laying the ground work for me in the early stage of the series. I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúGenius!‚Äù In all truth Steins;Gate has a Complex, Well-Written, Sci-Fi Thrilling Plot. Even though Steins;Gate is a show about time travel, I never found myself being confused by the concepts and theories it featured rather I found myself intrigued and infatuated by them. 
‚ÄúStory - and plot wise, Steins;Gate is pretty much an unprecedented piece of art, and I think it might stay so for a while.‚Äù
Furybylicious (User on MAL)
Characters: 9/10
One of the biggest criticisms that Steins;Gate face is that the characters hardly has any character development and I‚Äôm here to say your right, but your still wrong, for your outlook is wrong, had there been any further character development it would only take away from the OMFG amazing plot that is about to unfold.
Art: 7/10
The art is Steins;Gate wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶amazing, it wasn‚Äôt something you‚Äôd think to put as your wallpaper to be honest, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it was awful or poorly animated, all I can say the art played it‚Äôs part in creating the desired ‚Äúfeel‚Äù that the writer was trying to convey. I am still mind blown as to how Kurisu Jacket works but that‚Äôs another issue.
Sound: 9/10
This is the first anime I watched where the voice acting actually worked well with the animation and sounded completely original. The person(s) who handled music and sound‚Ä¶they knew what they were doing, the thing I loved most about how they dealt with it, is instead following most anime in their genre and used some slow instrumental music to guide the viewers thoughts and emotions  in times of sadness, shock and despair. Steins;Gate allowed the viewers thoughts and emotions to run wild by using complete significantly increasing the effect and enjoyment.
Enjoyment: 10/10
I‚Äôve seen a lot of reviews with an enjoyment section lately so I‚Äôll add one too, anyways, Steins;Gate will forever gain full marks. I still remember how I watched Steins;Gate I watched the entire series in one go, I was so addicted I couldn‚Äôt help myself from watching episode after one after the other, and when it came to its conclusion, I remember just before falling asleep I said to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to start watching anime‚Äù
I do hope you give this anime a chance as I know you won't regret it!!
Enjoy!!",9

                This series is by far the best of 2011, the author show clear knowledge of physics required to write the story while avoid making it sound boring, giving anime vibes to it, and keeping the science correct and intact, and for most unexplained holes within the theories the audiences could fill it up on their own(if they know physics) while ones that couldn't could still enjoy the story indifferently.
The creation of each characters are good, I mean within eastern media finding a mad scientist(or at least a self-proclaimed one) is incredibly rare, but Steins;Gate decide to use one as a protagonist! Okabe's frequent paranoid fantasy
                  keep the mood running at all time without dulling down, his character is neatly made with flashy lines in both serious and humorous situation. Though a hole in his character is how despite being a scientist, Okabe rarely explain any science occuring in the story and leaving it to Kurisu or Suzuha to do the job, which weaken his scientific character setup.(Like how he said he is more interested in researching than going out with girls, the anime never showed him doing the actual research, though it is presumable that he spent much of his off-screen time doing so.) Miyano-san portray his schizophrenia and maniacal laugh flawlessly and can cover his varying expressions accurately.
Kurisu is depicted as your everyday tsundere heroine, being better than the protagonist on the aspect of the theme but would act illogic from times to time to blend in with the environment. Her lines too, define her character clearly with seldom subtle sarcasm on scientific opinion targeted against Okabe, her reactions to Itaru's constant aberration keeps the mood and her character fresh without dulling down.
Mayuri though can be seen as a hindrance of the story, never actally doing any good and majority of the entire plot is focused on saving her, she is actually the very object that keep Okabe sane(actually 'healthily-insane' would be more accurate). Without Mayuri Okabe would be far more tense and serious, losing his lovable insane side.
On further minor notes, many minor details such as the Norse-mythology inspired operation names Okabe used are actually appropriately used(such as Audumbla, the Norse cosmic cow is used in an operation related to beef) and the usage of the real John Titor urban myth(John Titor is not made up, at least not by Steins;Gate team) is also accurate and appropriate.(Though the real Titor stated several nonsenses that didn't happened when the time did came, still it is possible as he came from an alternate world line so the changes in the world could have been different)
For some weak points the story have, firstly the arrangement of relationships. (SPOILER ALERT skip the rest of the review to avoid spoilers) From ep16~22 Okabe is depicted being paired with a girl in each ep, reflecting the romantic route accessible in the original game, this is not so neatly written as all females apart from Mayuri show no intimacy any further than friendship in prior eps, but suddenly develop a huge emotional leap towards Okabe for just 1 or 2 ep and no more, and though Kurisu is depicted as the main heroine of the anime(getting proper passionate kiss with Okabe), given that Okabe had been hanging around other girls for the last 5 eps, the impact of the kiss was not as effective as it is supposed to be.
Another very subtle error the story have is it does kill some of the science to enhance the drama in its place. This includes Kurisu acting unsure what actually happen after each time Okabe time leap when there is actually a definite answer to it.(The answer is: Okabe's time leap happen when he transfer his conscious brainwaves back in time into the brain of the Okabe hours or days prior to the leap. This mean that in the world line that Okabe had time leapt, his brain would no longer contain those brainwaves and shut off immediatly, resulting in him collapsing and dying at the spot, leaving that world line unaltered by anything other than of course, his own death. I clearly understand that if that answer is given out directly, it would totally ruin the mood of the scene and many of the earlier story as it would mean Okabe had abandoned countless world line in order to save one, which doesn't look like something a protagonist would do does it, so leaving out on this spot is highly forgivable.)
Lastly another error the story gave out is how Kurisu and Mayuri seem to be conscious of how they die(or seem to die). No explanation was given to this theory and I couldn't come up with a logical explanation to it either, so it seem this fact is given out to enhance very minor feel of drama while leaving a hole in the science.
In conclusion this is still the best anime 2011 had given  to me so far, so if you enjoy using some brains in the watching rather than sitting there and let any info the anime wants to give run into your head like many other animes, I would highly reccommend this anime as you would be able to learn some physics while enjoying the anime along.",9
"
                My only regret for this anime is why I didn't watch it earlier. I watched so many other anime before this one, and kept saying to myself: ""Yeah, I probably wouldn't like this one, even though its high ranked"".
But wow was I wrong. 
From the story to the sound to the characters, everything was top notch.
To me, the story and the characters were at a level far above any other anime I have watched.
Story about time travel is obviously going to be interesting in some way, but this one made the story seem almost plausible in the real world. The concept of world lines is
                  fascinating and the whole idea of switching to different world lines is mind boggling.
Characters. Give me any line from on of the characters, doesn't matter how small it is, I bet I can tell which character said it. That's how unique and powerful each character was. 
I had countless nights since I watched this anime where I would keep dreaming about time travel and the different scenes in the anime. I'm at the point where no other anime seems to have the same effect that this one did, and I don't think one will for a while.
If you haven't watched this anime, please do. It would be a shame for someone who watches anime to skip this one.",10

                Steins Gate. Having been an anime/manga enthusiast since my childhood days, I've seen a great variety of anime, a majority of which were highly acclaimed and popular shows; however, none of them are quite on the same level and caliber as Steins Gate. 
Let me explain. Steins Gate is a masterpiece of an anime, from Art to Characters, Voice Actors to Story. What makes Steins Gate great is undoubtedly the soundness of the story. It manages to present a very complex time-travel story that leaves little to no plot holes-- which has a solid start and end that complement one another. 
That being said, the
                  story isn't the sole reason Steins Gate is such a great piece of work. Steins Gate utilizes great Voice Acting and Art to create characters the viewer can associate to and learn to love over time. On the subject of time, the viewer is treated to a very slow and comedic start. The sudden change in tone is shocking for most as the show transitions into the second half, but this does not mean the first half of the show is ""bad"". The first half of the show can be looked back on and appreciated as a great way of character building and plot exposition. It helps create bonds between the viewer and the characters he/she sees on screen, and also manages to raise questions. The First Half, thus, can be seen as the ""training"" leading to a ""marathon"", it may not be as exciting, but it is important and perhaps the only reason the second half succeeds. The character interactions-- which seems to follow the discipline of the Hemingway's iceberg theory- plays a large part in the re-watch-ability of Steins Gate-- a show which was interesting consistently through the 2nd 3rd and 4th times I watched it, all thanks to the discovery process of what is below the surface. 
While a great plot is very important, it can't take an anime anywhere without the right art and overall presentation. Steins Gate's biggest flaw- aside from the fact that it ends and potentially throws it's viewers into a post anime depression phase- would be it's art. Steins Gate has very pretty art which accomplishes a lot, notably, the art that is used in Steins Gate is very realistic looking in comparison to many anime. From the realistic-looking cities you see in the background, to the anatomically correct faces that don't exaggerate the eyes to the same extent as most anime. It accomplishes what it seeks to do, the illusion that the world we see in Steins Gate, is just an alternate reality parallel to our own. However, it sometimes goes overboard with the use of realism, sometimes putting too much detail in the character's faces, a majority of these instances creating a creepy look due to the exaggeratedly realistic features of characters. These instances would be suitable for moments when the show seeks to make its viewer uncomfortable, but it doesn't always accomplish that; instead, it often interferes with moments that are potentially romantic, tragic, and tender. However, regardless of that flaw, Steins Gate still manages to send out the feels train, the rails it runs on consisting of Audio and Plot. The beautiful piano pieces of Steins Gate and the voices behind the characters are so well done, regardless of the occasional awkward-looking facial expression, it still manages to deliver a package that tugs at the viewer's heartstrings. The reason Steins Gate is- in my mind- a miraculous masterpiece of an anime, is because it is incredibly well supported, utilizing art, sound, character depth, and story in such a brilliant way; Steins Gate uses all these listed elements intelligently to create the concrete and well thought out anime that this show undoubtedly is. So with that said, it would feel idiotic to give this anime anything short of an outstanding 10/10.",10

                I don't know what to say about Steins;Gate that hasn't already been said. It has interesting and diverse characters an intriguing concept and thrilling twists and turns after the somewhat slow first half. You'll appreciate the first half later though as it introduces you and gets you attached to the main characters. What made this so enjoyable for me was not only  the interesting sci-fi plot line but the characters and how they interact. We have Mayuri the strange girl who loves cosplay and saying ""TooTooRoo!"" Okabe a mad scientist addicted to Dr pepper (excuse me DK pepper for copyright reasons) Makise Kurisu the
                  scientist who tries not to believe whats happening right in front of her and the super haxor Daru. These characters make the whole show really enjoyable and if you haven't watched Steins;Gate go do it right now.

                      The latest buzz on everyone mind is Steins;Gate. Many are saying its the best anime they ever saw. IMO it was ""OK"" of an anime.
At first it was good, decent progression and was building up the characters very well. But i beleive it couldve been much better. If only the ending wasnt such a predictable cookie cutter ending this couldve been high on the charts. 
The story is pretty much about a guy who makes a time machine that can send texts into the past where
                  it alters the present. But the further he digs into this, it becomes much much more. Forcing him to relive horrible moments over and over again. If you like animes with a semi dark story line with good character progression then this is for you.
Story: 9
Story was really good and very well played out. Nice proggresion and didnt feel like it was rushed to quickly finish up the show.
Art: 10 
The art was crisp and very nice to look at. even watching it streaming it was very good quality.
Sound: 8 
The sound was ok, its hard to really judge a anime on sound because why would i focus on sound above otehr important factors?
Character: 9
This is where the anime really shined. Pretty much everyone noticed that the character proggression was suprisengly very well done compared to other animes that have come out past season.
Overall: 7
Good story, Good Characters just a bad follow through at the end.",7

                2nd anime MAL review in my life:
TL;DR at the bottom!!!
Story:
One word: PLOT TWIST! Okay, that was definitely one word more than one but my point is, in here, the plot wouldn't be itself without the twist. Get it? You may call it a bit clich√©d but the way things are laid around the story out would definitely catch you off guard, by that I mean me, of course, and that's where the thriller (that moment when you feel your skin crawling) on par with that of Death Note kicks in. Though it's not the best story you've ever known, comparing its plot to those of
                  other time travel themed shows such as Predestination (2014 film), Puella Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, Re:Zero, etc. is an insult, not to say they're not amazing in their own right. And I almost forgot two important things: the synopsis above, don't let the synopsis get to your head, synopses are often undermining, and the pacing, this is a consistently common setback when you are used to fast-paced shows so lower your temper and higher your patience, okay?
--> 10/10
Art:
Too bad to say that while I'm fairly observant and considerably picky of the art of the anime I watch, I am a proud novice when it comes to judging them with precision, though I have my own opinions. The art is not the best but when its very excellent during the times of situational highlights. The lighting and face effects itself are way more than enough to convey the main mood focused in the entirely of an episode.
--> 9/10
Sound:
Most people might disagree with me but the sound is one of the best things that have happened during the whole show. Whether it be lighthearted or extremely tensed, practically every mood is instantly captured by the sound effects and soundtrack even better than the art did. Both the OP and ED are not catchy, but impressively nostalgic and unforgettable ‚Äî they fit perfectly with the entire premise of the show.
--> 10/10
Character:
Let's be honest and realistic. This entire cast, you might think, is full of generic, non-characteristic stereotypes, right? Well, not really, if you read between their dialogues and look right each of them in the eye, they're...
wait for it..
A BUNCH OF IDIOTS!
Just kidding, I'm actually just really biased since I'm a noob so low that even newer noobs seem genius to me, but wait.. why are we talking about me now?
Okay, back to the original topic, what I actually thought about the characters is that they're a bit unpredictable IMHO, especially the main characters. And that quite a bit speedy character development of Rintarou Okabe, it's already near-perfect.. but then again who am I kidding? I'm still being biased right here so...
--> 9/10
Enjoyment:
Either everything's almost perfect or almost everything is perfect, it doesn't matter. It's definitely one of best anime I've watched as an unassuming noob. And if you've read everything before this part, then I don't think I have to tell you and explain a little more why I could give it a...
--> 10/10 , I don't have to, right?
Overall:
Despite everything I've praised and loved about this anime, I don't downright rate it the way I believe it should be rated since I have my own rating formula (see formula in my profile). And using this formula,
   (10 + 9 + 10 + 9 + 10 + ( [10] * 5 ) ) / 10
 I'm giving this anime a 9.8.
--> 10/10
TL;DR:
One of the best, 10/10. Please be patient and watch it without expectations (or keep them to a minimum) so that you'd enjoy it. Note that this is a biased, noob-friendly advice from a fellow noob so you can rest assured. If after everything, you regret watching, I'll be happy to accept your valid arguments. Anyway, it's not supah-hackah.
It's SUPER-HACKER, duh!",10

                I finished Steins;Gate some time ago, but recently I found myself thinking about a review from Steins;Gate now that it's got it's recognition and it's really nicely ranked on the site. This review is more about my thoughts on the Anime and not much a preview and may contain spoilers. So here I go.
Steins;Gate is one of those Animes that really catch my eye at a first glance. As you watch the first episode, you keep looking for common anime characters or common anime traits to try to settle what's going on with the Anime or where it will go, but to no avail. You
                  really feel a bit lost at the begining, as the anime tells it's own story without giving you more than just hints on what's really happening, and without following major anime trends or themes(initially). So, no big fights, no big boobs, no ""suddenly my life changed when I entered High School"". And when I see this in an Anime, I know that there's something intersting coming, because the Anime is trying to tell it's own personal story, be it good or bad. Now what's really awesome, even outside of my personal tastes, is that this is one of those animes that gives us an original piece of something AND what a briliant piece it is! Following the middle of the story, you just can't move your eyes away from the screen and, by the end, you just can't hold your jaws up. Yes, that's right, this anime is what we call a masterpiece.
Steins;Gate starts very slowly, and introduces very crazy(interesting for me!) characters, like our beloved scientist Hoouin Kyouma. He keeps spouting nonsense and people around him seems to jupt keep up with him. It's easy to perceive that they are nothing more than internal jokes or ""delusions"" and we should expect someone who is a friend of his to be as crazy as him or extremly friendly or understanding, as we find the ones around him to actually be. And those characters really make up the show. It's easy to fall in love with them and their manias and personal stories that are very well developed throught the Anime. Even the ""bad guys""(not actually bad guys) find a place in our hearts. Character development is impecable, specially for Kurisu and Kyouma, who change completely towards the end of the show without losing their essence. Other characters also develop, but more in a ""revealing"" way, as main events are more focused on the main characters. But their side stories stay as a major part of the show and are very, very entertaining. Last but not least, all characters have very remarkable and belivable(in their context) personalities that make the show so funny, sad and dramatic at the same time. So, 10 for characters!
The story, as I said, start kind of slow(not for me!) while building up a mysterious atmosphere(wich I personally love) towards events surrounding time travel, wich is the main (serious) theme. Okarin just can't keep away from that, as if a conspiracy is running in the shadows. It prepares us and feed us important information that allow us to understand and enjoy even more the events that succeed the introduction.
The scientist start to mess with time, trying to change the fate of the world, the true job of a ""MAD SCIENTIST, SUNOVABITCH"". Only to end up messing things a bit too much. Chaos distorts the world beyond the planned(what we call teh butterfly effect) and then Kyouma has to fix what he's done, but it's not an easy task! We embark on a journey involving action, drama, science(believable, much) where shit some times get totally out of control. This is the part where your eyes are glued to the screen. I just couldn't stand the wait, episode after episode, it's SO COOL. And, piece by piece, the story unfolds into a beautiful plot  that will leave your mind blewn while, at the same time, entartaining you and your feelings to the max. By the end, you're just amazed by the story and the emotional rollercoaster feels really great. It has briliant thinking, wrap up all the mysteries perfectly and you're just satisfied with what you just watched, all of that summed with a very nice work on the scientific side including time travel. Steins;Gate really tells the story using plausible explanations and event that follow all the rules of physics and reasonable, believable logic. I say believable because when logic is applied to events that may result in paradoxes, today's scientific explanations are all based on theories that, some times, seem to go beyond ou understanding of what's really possible. But this Anime follows what a good article on physics and time theory would say. So, for a story that entertains, is a perfect combinatin of funny, sad and action packed scenes(action as in making you sit in the tip of your chair), concludes epicaly and is in the good side of Science, 10 for story!
Well, about the Art and Sound, I usually am not very specific on these because I think that Art is not something good or bad, it's something fitting. Same for the sound. But I find almost no complaints in this section of this anime.
For the Art, the anime features a good drawing that fits extremly well with this scientific, yet comedic and emotional show. But it has not anything that is specially beautiful, hard to draw or to animate. Nothing that makes your eyes shine, but I must give Art a 9 for the really fitting design and almost flawless animation in what it does animate.
For the sound, Steins;Gate has some really nice themes that fit very well the very diferent moments that the Anime features, but no one of them is really something to remember. That may be a good point, because that means that it doesn't steals all the atention from the sreen. But I must emphatize that the OSTs in the Anime really contribute for the scenes and deserve praise. The opening really is notable, even if I personally didn't enjoy it as much as most people did. About the ending, I actually really liked it, more than the opening. All in all, the sound score of Steins;Gate deserves a 9 too.
Enjoyment: Well, I guess that all that I previously said contributes to this. I really loved this anime. I'm a fan of this one since the first few episodes, and I remember when most peple had just dropped it because they didn't like the pacing. Look where this anime is now, third place(as I write this review) on the site. I really think that people should change their ways of predicting if an Anime is going to be good or not. Steins;Gate is a perfect example of that. I am even very surprised at how high this anime got, because people usually don't go throught their ""cover judging"". Steins;Gate really is an anomaly in this kind of anime. Cough... 10 for enjoyment!
Concluding, I really recommend this anime to EVERYONE. Even to people who don't usually watch anime. I have a list of animes that I think are meant to eveyone, not just anime viewers, and this anime is on top of that list, together with animes like Shin Sekai Yori or movies like Ghost in the Shell. Just bear the ""slow beginning"" of the anime(imagine the roller coaster cart going up the rail) and then enjoy one of the best rides you will ever get.",10

                Hello, this is my first ever review on an anime so please don't laugh or make fun of my literature :).
[My opinion, age group, genre ect] 
""Steins;Gate"" This anime is one of my top favorites i 100% recommend it if you like anime's that are seinen, sci-fi, thriller and also have a good comedy aspect. The comedy side of the anime isn't the best I've seen but it's enough to make you laugh and chuckle. The age group i recommend this anime too is more angled to the younger audiences, i do think this is an anime for males but females can defiantly watch this.
[Story]
                  10/10 [minor spoilers]
The start of the story is very technical and hard to understand throughout the first few episodes seeing it does have a strange starting. The plot it's self is about Rintarou Okabe and his gang named Future Gadget Laboratory which consists of the following members, Kurisu Makise[Christina as nicknamed by Okabe], Mayuri Shiina, Itaru Hashida his two nicknames are Daru[main] or as Okabe calls him [Hack] and Suzuha Amane, so pretty much they are a group of friends who have customized their microwave into a device that can send text messages to the past, as they perform different experiments, an organization named SERN, who has been doing their own research on time travel, find out that Okabe and his gang have figured out how to move through time lines so they abruptly chase them down, SERN ends up being one of the members of Future Gadget Laboratory (minor spoilers) and shoots one of the main characters which whom bleeds out, with Okabe being in shock he runs to his microwave and sends a message back in time which makes him go back in time to another time line so he can save the character before the character dies, as he keeps having to do it a lot of times, watching the character die over and over as if its meant to happen, these psychological turn of events are making him on the brink of insanity.
[Art] 8/10
There isn't much to say about the art style, it was very good it didn't have any mess ups, i am not saying that on 100% accuracy because i was too focused on the plot to notice, the quality is defiantly crisp and enjoyable. 
[Sound] 7/10
The sound tracks get your heart pumping and give you that feeling that you're in that certain situation, although there're defiantly others in the world of anime that could easily be more enjoyable but i still like them all.
[Characters] 10/10
The characters are usually always full of life, they have such beautiful personality's especially the females, Okabe is a really lovable character he's rather blabbering on about the organization or fighting with Kurisu, the other characters are great and likable some shy some full of life and some just plain lazy.
[Enjoyment] 10/10
I really enjoyed this anime it really sunk the sinker and hooked me right in. ""Steins;Gate"" is an anime that i can watch again and not be bored, this show really is memorable, i will always think of it if a friend wants me to recommend an anime to them.
[Overall] 10/10",10
"
                This was definitely a thought-provoking anime. I‚Äôve often asked myself the question, ‚ÄúWhat if I could go back in time? What would I do? What would I change? What would happen if I was able to go against the flow of time?‚Äù This anime answered some of my most complex questions regarding time travel and I enjoyed watching every minute of it. 
Story: 10/10
The story follows Okabe Rintaro, the self-proclaimed ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù, and his adventures with time travel. Do not get thrown off by the first episode‚ÄîI know that it may be confusing but as you progress through the anime all of the bits and
                  pieces will fit together.  There were a lot of tense and philosophical moments in the story but there was also the much-needed comic relief.  I also think that the pacing of this anime was excellent. It was slow and relaxing up until episode 5; allowing the audience to slowly take in the plot. And from episode 5 onwards, it started to speed up and there was much suspense and excitement. There was also a fair bit of romance-- which I enjoyed. Other great things about the story are that it is unpredictable and that it makes you want to see more and more. The ending was very satisfying. 
Art: 10/10
I liked the art alot and I felt that the character designs really did match the characters‚Äô personalities. I also liked how most of the focus was placed on the characters instead of the background which made the story easier to follow. I don‚Äôt know a lot about animation but I thought the colours really set the tone for the story.
Sound: 9/10
The voice actors for this anime were very talented. I haven‚Äôt watched it dubbed so I don‚Äôt really what the English voice actors were like but the Japanese voice actors really did embrace their characters. The only thing that may have made this anime better was background music for some of the scenes. 
Characters 10/10
Each of the characters in this anime were very unique. They all had their strengths and weaknesses and they were all able to see situations differently. I fell in love with Okabe‚Äôs eccentric ways and Kurisu‚Äôs perseverance. Daru would often make me laugh and Mayushii was absolutely adorable. Okabe does, however, change slowly as the anime progresses because of the events that befall him and he becomes more serious.
Enjoyment 10/10
I enjoyed this anime and I feel like other people would too. Steins;Gate is very refreshing and it‚Äôs worth the watch. Even if you‚Äôre someone who doesn‚Äôt really watch anime you should give it a try if you enjoy sci-fi, time-travel, etc.",10
"
                I don't see many people writing about what Steins Gate really means.
Well, according to ""The Mad Scientist Okarin"" it doesn't mean absolutely nothing.
Well, i'm here to prove that the creators were rather smart on this one or was it just pure luck. But as i don't believe in luck i will say that they were really smart.
As we all know ""Albert Einstein"" was the father of the Quantum Theory, although he couldn't really understand all of it, not even a quarter he still made some progress on that area. And when we talk about Quantum Theory we are talking about the world of ""Multiverse"", meaning:
                  You are leaving in this universe, but there are lots of other universes where the same thing (or not depending on the universe) is happening right now as i'm writing this.
Nowadays we are a lot more advanced in the quantum theory and in what the multiverse world really is like and this is no sci fi, this is real science.
Today we have the pupil of Albert Einstein, which the name itself is ""Paul Steinhardt"".
Now as i mentioned earlier, the creators are no fools. They even mention SERN which is a company that actually exists in Genova going by the true name of ""CERN"" and they focus themselves a lot on the quantum subject and multiverse as well as black holes.
As we have seen in the anime itself, they are not actually traveling through time, they are changing the timeline which means that this is actually one of the Einstein theories.
The name ""STEINS GATE"" in my opinion, and believe me, its only my opinion, nothing was confirmed, comes from the ""Albert Einstein"" and ""Paul Steinhardt"" studies on the multiverse theory.
Of course i maybe wrong, but still it makes perfect sense and it actually means something to the anime. Since he story of this anime is so, so, so, so solid, i can't even stand that the name ""Steins Gate"" means absolutely nothing.
Maybe for Okabe it doesn't but in the general anime series it has a lot of meaning to it.
Basically ""Steins Gate"" means to open a ""gate"". Gate which Einstein and Steinhardt themselves have studied.
In other words it means ""Open a gate to the multiverse"".
Do you agree? =)",10

                I usually do not write any review, but this time I had to. Steins;Gate is an anime that differs from others: not related to ""slice of life"", no monsters, no ""ultra-cheated hero""‚Ä¶ I enjoyed the whole thing and fell off my chair more than once while watching the series as the surprise can arrive at any moment. As you progress in the story, you'll be eager to see the next part, let's see, ""What'll happen? Who's gonna do what?"" at each ending !
Each character has his own personality, which is somehow exciting, they all own a bit of originality. As for the music, you won't
                  be disappointed, as the opening/ending themes are great, and the bgms are well-chosen.
Here's a quick review of the different points I quoted:
Story: Surprising. I did not expect something like this at all, as they based themselves on a true story (whether the facts are true or not is off-topic).
Design: Well, it's ok. Sometimes I found it weird, but the scenes, characters and backgrounds still are great.
BGMs, op/ed: Relaxing. If you didn't know what you're gonna listen to, then the opening is the answer. As for the ending theme, it's also very suited to the series, as it was changed once or twice according to the development, I don't really remember.
Characters: I'm the Mad Scientist! Nobody disappointed me, all I can say is ""Tutulu~""!
Enjoyment: Superb. I did enjoy the series during each episode, with great suspense sometimes and humor parts.
Conclusion: if it wasn't on your watch list, just start watching it without putting it as ""Plan to watch""!",9

                I've never been that much of a science fiction fan, it just never really caught my attention.
Until Steins;Gate. 
Steins;Gate elegantly weaves time travel theories, fantastic characters, real world events, and romance into something close to a masterpiece.
	I will say that this is my first review, and it may not be as long or detailed as others', but I do intend to include everything of importance, so bear with me here.
	I'll be trying to spoil as little as possible in this review, but there may be some minor spoilers lying within my words, so readers beware.
Now, onto the review!
	Story: 10
Like I said, I'm not too familiar
                  with science fiction, so I can't accurately compare it to many other time travel stories, but that's not necessary to appreciate how fantastic a series this is. 
	I've come across several series that involve time travel, or throw it into the mix as a sort of ""Plot Twist"" and just fall flat and ruin everything. Steins;Gate does not do that, however. Steins;Gate constructs a unique story that makes time travel seem simple, realistic and believable while still remaining original and fascinating.
	It also not only focuses on the effects of time travel, but on the act of time travel itself. In fact, the whole first half of the show is mostly the characters running experiments, testing the limits of their time machine, and studying ever minute detail. Some argue the pacing during this is too slow, but I believe it's engaging, interesting and incredibly creative. It's a much more realistic approach, and getting the slower stuff out of the way in the beginning is much better than having to deal with it in an anti-climactic way during more suspenseful episodes.
	However, about halfway through the series, shit hits the fan when a nasty plot twist emerges. Subtly foreshadowed and perfectly timed, it was neither expected nor out of nowhere. After this, the series becomes significantly less lighthearted and much faster paced and suspenseful. In the latter half of the series it deals with the effect of time travel, but does so in a way that doesn't fall for typical, predictable cliches. Steins;Gate has one of the most intriguing, and creative stories I've seen.
	Art: 8
Unfortunately, the art is nothing particularly spectacular. Nothing really stands out, there are no scenes that fill you with awe at how wonderfully animated they are. However, it is in no way bad, or lacking. The art accomplishes what it wishes to accomplish, no more no less. It's nothing worth deducting points off of the show overall, nor is it worth adding any. The animation in Steins;Gate has little impact on the series, so there's not a lot to say about it.
	Sound: 9
Like the art, the soundtrack isn't much worth noting, with the exception of the opening, which fits the mood of the show and has become one of my personal favorites that I didn't once skip during the series, the background music is pretty simple, it adds to the scenes, definitely, but there are no tracks I really payed too much attention to.       
	Now, that being said, I don't like to review voice acting since I don't speak Japanese and therefore don't know how realistic it is, but comparing it to other anime I've seen, it's done exceptionally well. Each characters' voice is lively and filled with emotion, especially the main character. Every voice is perfectly cast and completely fitting to the character's personality. You can obviously tell how much effort was put into the voice acting in the original Japanese dub. 
	After finishing the series I went back and tried the English dub, which was, while not the worst I've heard, not nearly as well-done as the sub. So, unless you are opposed to having to read subtitles, I would absolutely recommend watching the sub rather than the dub.
	Characters: 10
I struggled for a while deciding whether or not to rate the characters a 9 or a 10, but in the end I decided it deserved no less than a 10. The cast, while of course not totally without flaw, is the closest to perfect I've ever seen. You could put all the characters in a room together and just the interactions between them is highly entertaining to see. these interactions are what make the slower first half of the series so enjoyable to watch, there's hardly a dull moment in this entire series. 
	As all of the characters are so different, and due to how much each of them add to the series, I think the least I can do is review each member of the main cast individually;
	Okabe Rintarou: 10
I'll start with our main character, Okabe Rintarou. With how many boring, personality-less male main characters there are in anime, especially more recent ones, Okabe is a breath of fresh air. He is vibrant, lively, and all the flaws with the other characters is made up for with this fantastic lead.
	Okabe receives excellent development, and is very... Human, he's realistic. He has flaws, but in the way a good character should, the series would not be the same without him, and I cannot praise him as a character enough.
	On top of that, his romantic relationship with another character, Makise Kurisu, is not forced whatsoever. It's one of the few anime romances that I actually enjoyed. The two have great chemistry and while the romance isn't a major focus through most of the show, it definitely added a nice touch.
	Makise Kurisu: 9
Kurisu starts out as just your typical, cliche tsundere love interest, and while she doesn't develop as much as the main character, she does evolve into a much more interesting character, and I feel she pulls off the tsundere trope much better than many. 
	The problem with so many female anime characters is that they're usually either ridiculously overpowered and have no point other than to be badass, or are weak, whiny, and really have no point at all, with the latter being much more common. Makise Kurisu takes both of these and blends them together into what I think is a really great character. She's intelligent, and strong, and at the same time has real emotions and weaknesses, but she still really stands out from other tsundere characters in different shows.
	Hashida Itaru (Daru): 7
Daru is definitely the weakest of the main characters. He doesn't develop at all, we get no backstory on him whatsoever, and we really don't know get to know much about his personality, all we know about him is he's a perverted, nerdy computer hacker with a fetish for ‚Äú2D Girls‚Äù and is constantly spewing double entendrees.
 	Now, with that in mind, he's still pretty important to the plot. Well, parts of it, anyway. He's in charge of the hacking, and the computer stuff, and nearing the end there is a bit of a plot twist involving him that was pretty interesting. What I said earlier about how enjoyable it is to watch just the interactions between the characters, he plays a big part in some of those scenes. 
	So he's not exactly a bad character, but I think he could have been done a lot better than he was.
	Shiina Mayuri: 8
Okay, so I really like moe characters. I know they're a really overdone anime trope, but they're so cute and likeable! I think a lot of the time they just add so much lightheartedness to a series. Making Mayuri a moe character was a good choice, and I feel the series would just have taken itself too seriously if it weren't for her. You can't help but smile when she's on screen, and her innocence and naivety makes certain parts of Steins;Gates a lot more powerful and memorable.
	And she wasn't just there to make the show more lighthearted, I won't say why, but she's actually one of the most important characters in the cast.
	Really, I can't go into much detail about Mayuri without spoiling things, but I did enjoy her, my only problem is that they should have given her more development, and her personality could have been fleshed out a bit more.
	I think we could have gotten a bit more backstory on all of the characters,
We don't really know anything about their pasts, apart from some flashbacks of Okabe and Mayuri as kids, and a little info about Kurisu's past. This isn't a flaw, per se, but it's something I would've liked to have been included, but I understand there's only so much you can put in a 24 episode series.
	Enjoyment: 9
For the most part, I really enjoyed this series. From the pacing, to the character interactions, to the suspense and intrigue, everything was great. It was happy, fun, emotional, and just fantastic in so many ways.
	My only real problem was that nearing the end it started to become very much like a harem. I mean, it wasn't exactly boring, but during one of the most suspenseful times of the show, suddenly they're dedicating entire episodes to Okabe going on dates with side characters who you knew full well there was going to be no real romantic development with. It's a little more complicated than that, and I do appreciate that they tried to give more focus onto individual side characters, and maybe I'm just nitpicking here, but I think it was rather anti-climactic.
	Overall Rating: 9
After how much praise I've just given Steins;Gate in this review, you may be wondering why I gave it an overall rating of 9 instead of 10. Well that's because of one thing; the Deus Ex Machina ending. For me, endings of a series are pretty important, it's the last thing I see, and that makes it the last thing I judge a show by, so if a show has a bad ending, I will think of that bad ending whenever I think of the series itself. And I'm not saying the ending was exactly bad, but I didn't like it. I can't really talk about it much without getting into huge spoilers, but the last two episodes seemed to be tacked on out of nowhere to give the series a happy ending. While it was well done, it seemed to undermined everything that had happened before it more than a little bit, and I think it would've been better had they ended it after 22 episodes, maybe an extra episode to wrap things up.
	Apart from the ending, I think Steins;Gate is an amazing series, with great characters, suspense, and a great example of an anime done right. Overall, I cannot recommend Steins;Gate enough.",9

                Part 2 of the Science Adventure Trilogy
I had heard going into this that this was one of the best anime ever made. I don't think that I am the kind to give into hype (then again, I haven't really been tested), so I tried to go into it from an objective standpoint.
The hype was completely accurate.
I do not give out 10s lightly. It can't just be a show that I absolutely love and want to go back to any day of the week. That is enough to warrant a 9. To get a 10 from me a show needs to have something special, something that
                  won't be found in just any anime. So far I have rated 5 shows 10, and they were all for different reasons. Death Parade for its crushing realism and drama, FMA: Brotherhood for its epic scope, Psycho-Pass for its unpretentious intellect, Death Note for L (the plot is clever in too many ways to count, but still, mostly L), and Fullmetal Alchemist for its brilliant story. Steins;Gate gets a 10 for its characters. Not just one in particular, the whole cast.
The reasoning is twofold. First off, the story itself allows for some of the most haunting and real character moments that I have ever seen. The second reason is the dub cast. This is right up there with Baccano!, Fullmetal Alchemist (either one), and Soul Eater as one of the best dubs ever made, especially on the part of the two leads. J. Michael Tatum and Trina Nishimura deserve nothing less than a standing ovation. 
I absolutely love this show to death. From me, an overall rating of 10 is the highest recommendation possible.",10

                [Spoiler Warning]
""Daru is like the universe, constantly expanding""- Okabe Rintarou
I never really felt like this was the anime for me because of the genres. But after my ""Scientist"" friend was like ""eyy, lets watch Steins,Gate"" So we did, and oh boy it was good. So, what is this show? It is about time travel. I expected something like Dr. Who but it was more than that. Since Okabe isn't the immortal time lord who kills Daleks for fun, he is a Mad Scientist that goes by the name Hououin Kyoma. We follow him and his lab members creating all types of gadgets and gizmos in
                  his future lab. Most of them are literally useless but some actually have some use to them.
The Story: We follow Okabe as he goes to a presentation about Time Travel and is it possible? He meets up with a girl named Makise Kurisu who is smart person who has made a very good thesis on how to build a time machine. He witnesses Makises death before his very eyes and escapes the building and sends a phone message to Daru. That causes Okabe to travel into another world line also known as Alpha timeline. That is the timeline where Makise is alive. Now, they gather up the crew and Okabe figures out the basic idea of a time travel in the form of a Phone Microwave. He can send messages to the past and that changes the world line where that thing occurred. Now he teams up with Makise Kurisu to build the first time machine. Things eventually lead to a big problem. Since in that timeline One of the lab members is fated to die. Okabe tried to fix it but it is a no go and he has to undo all the previous phone messages. The entire plot after all the phone messages is that Okabe tries to find the Steins Gate world line where all the characters survive and are all alive. 
Characters: Okabe ""Hououin Kyoma"" Rintarou is our beloved scientist or as he call himself a mad scientist. He is as charismatic as he is crazy. He is 18 and an university student I think. He is very delusional or Chuunibyo. He talks to himself a lot and talks about some ""organisation"" He always ends his messages with El Psy Kongroo. Makise Kurisu is a smart scientist. She is one of the key members in the creation of the time machine since her thesis on it was brilliant. She and Okabe always get into arguments over dumb stuff. Shiina Mayuri is Okabes Assistant and a very good friend. They have known each other since childhood. Mayuri kinda just cooks food and interacts with the other lab members. Daru is the Super hacker. He can crack into every website and such. His hacking skills are beyond human. He is a very big otaku. He calls people normies, is into lolis and plays dating sims. He is also the mechanic of the crew. He built the time machine or fixed it in this case. The rest of the supporting cast is very memorable and beautiful in their own way. We have maids, time travelers, lunatics and of course a trap.
The ost in Steins;Gate is one of the best in anime. There are a lot of good songs in there. I really love my Gate of Steiner and Re-Awaken. Those are just beautiful. All of the songs are just beautiful and they fit in the show very well. Also the opening in this anime is just plain awesome. The song is good and very well written and composed. The visuals are complex, interesting and contrasts the song well. 
If you love sci-fi, time travel, doctor who, science or other stuff like that then I recommend this whole heartedly. This might have a slow start but the character development is just amazing. First like 10 episodes are just getting to know these characters and it does a good job at that. All the characters feel so real and they are all so expressive especially Okabe.",10
"
                Story: 10/10
No story implements such a unique plot as this and not to mention so much to do with the complexities of time. Sure, what was going on in the later episodes was a lot to take in and I thought of it getting a little repetitive a few times but the different ways of countering those obstacles and the emotions and endurances the character had to go through made up for it.
Character: 9/10
I never really forgot about each supporting character because they all played a HUGE role and really affected the outcome of what the main character was aiming for. Every character introduced comes
                  back into play when you thought they were of no importance and bring a surprising plot twist. Each character is not what you think they are as some reveal their shocking identity.
The feelings and relationships between Okabe and a certain character (*cough* *cough* tsundere *cough*) brought me to the edge of my seat. That certain character despite not knowing whats going on and the difficult hardships, shows that he/she can relate the Okabe and give him a hand. 
However, one of the characters, Mayuri's, repetitive fate in a select few of the episodes kind of ticked me off because it got annoying a bit. Although that character isn't useful at first and keeps getting in the way and being a burden, this character is really cute and seemed like a mascot as she was cheering everyone on.
Animation: 10/10
I don't any flaws I can point at about the Art. It was top notch and each color was vivid and brought you to the scene. Like the brightness of a summer day in some scenes made it really feel like summer even if there wasn't a description or the sound of cicadas in the background. If there was a certain event going on like jumping to different places, you'd know what was happening because of it being clearly portrayed by the art.
As for the opening, it didn't fail to impress in the slightest as it seemed to remind you about time and uh.. it was a simplistic opening and really moved smoothly with the music..
Sound: 8/10
I have to admit, the English dubbed version wasn't actually bad at all. I wasn't alarmed by any of character's voice pitch being too high or too low.
Mayuri for instance had an incredibly adorable voice to match her innocent appearance. 
Faris voice in English dub was perfect but in English sub was even cuter because of how she'd add  ""nya"" to the end of her sentences which'd match her to being moe and like a cat as how she portrays herself to be in her maid cafe.
The music in the opening was pretty catchy and makes you want to listen to it over and over again.. or maybe that's just me..
The only thing that'd bring down this score is whenever Okabe says certain lines (not the usual kind) in English during a English sub (with Japanese voice actors). It made me want to face palm. .  Some other side characters (like badge maker and the official at the airport in the special), supposedly fluent in English or is just pure American, sounded extremely weird and unnatural.",10
"
                Firstly, the comments that state the series starts off slow are misleading. It does take awhile to get to the main story, but ""Steins;Gate"" never fails to entertain on any level, and in fact engages on all levels beautifully. 
Humor? Hilarious. Intensity? Absolute. Drama? Memorable. Starting as the misfits of a self proclaimed mad scientist who may have stumbled upon a means of time travel, this series can shift gears in the blink of an eye, without anyone even taking notice, because it does every tonal shift excellently. 
It's rare to see such a combination of genres pull off all of it's genres (FMAB takes
                  the 2nd place in this). We have a science-fiction thriller with elements of Haruhi Suzumiya esque club based slice-of-life dramedy, with elements of political thriller and a tone of psychological philosophy (of Heidegger) to boot. Plus the story is damn realistic which makes it even more compelling. I don't want to spoil this gem. This series should simply be experienced with as little foresight as possible.",10
"
                Uh, wow... Just finished watching about 10 minutes before writing this review. This is easily in my top 5 favorite anime series of all time, maybe even the king of kings.
Basically, in every aspect of anime that I enjoy, this is perfect. It is incredibly hilarious at times, absolutely devastating at other times (in a Clannad After Story kind of way, not a Grave of the Fireflies way). The characters are wonderful, and even though there are a couple that occasionally get on my nerves (Feyris mostly), these characters are wisely given less screen time so that I don't actually get bothered by them. Okabe
                  in particular is one of the most fascinating main characters I've come across. He's actually a borderline disturbed individual, but always in a way that makes him quite likeable.
I'm usually skeptical of romance in anime, only because I've seen too many shounens where the romance arc is built up over the entire show so that the viewer might at the end, just maybe, see the two characters admit that they value each other's company. Huh? Yeah, I can't stand that crap either. In more recent years anime seems to be finally growing past that. Without giving away who (and honestly, there are a few possibilities for much of the show), I'll just say that they do a very nice job of it in this one.
The show also features an incredibly complex storyline. It's no spoiler to give away that this show involves time travel, and you will see the story rewritten many times over. In spite of that, understanding is never lost in the shuffle. I never felt like I was lost as far as what had taken place.
In between the comedy and tragedy that are so pervasive in the show, there is also a strong element of sci-fi thriller. The show also excels here, at times it is really intense.
Not sure what else to say. I feel that, while I've rated a number of other series 10 on this website, this one really has everything I want. Completing this series leaves with a sort of awestruck feeling, where you want to just sit and reflect on it. I firmly put it on par with masterpieces like Utena, Legend of Galactic Heroes, Monster, and the remake of FMA.",10

                Hey, This is my first review so I will try to make it as informative as possible without giving out any spoilers.
Story: 10
The story follows a young man named Okabe Rintar≈ç, he is a self proclaimed 'mad scientist', that works in a lab with 2 other lab members: Hashida Itaru (AKA Daru) who is a computer hacker that is a little on the large side. 
Besides Daru and Okabe there is one more member of the 'Future Gadgets Lab', a girl, younger than Okabe, her name is Mayuri Shiina, she doesn't really have a position at the lab but likes too hang around and design
                  cosplay clothing.
This 'slow' life suddenly changes one day when Okabe Rintar≈ç attempts to cook a banana with his new 'phone microwave', upon hearing the beeping noise that indicates a microwave has finished cooking, Okabe proceeds to collect his banana, and too his surprise the banana has vanished, although it has not vanished,but merely returned too its previous position attached to the stem of two other bananas, but it is in a 'Gel' state.......
The events following this event are simply brilliant, the victories and perils of time travel, numerous twists and turns, Steins Gate takes you on an unforgettable journey through time and mystery, at one point after watching 10 or so episodes in a day I didn't know how to approach life or the possibilities of this infinite universe.
Character: 10
The character development was amazing and changes the entire show more than once, whilst the character development is not restricted to the main characters it brings a whole new way of thinking into the equation, as in different world lines (split/parallel realities) people can have different personalities, due to what has happened to them in that world line apposed to the original.
Enjoyment: 10
Personally I thoroughly enjoyed Steins Gate, the emotional and mental experience of the viewer is unmatched by anything I have seen before.
This series has an incredible amount of twists and really gets you thinking, and when you finally think you can anticipate the next moment, the show has you right where it wants you, wrapped around its finger so unsuspectingly you fall victim too the twists and turns that completely change the outcome and your perception of episodes too come.
Overall: 10
I believe this was the best anime I have seen too date and would give it a perfect 10 as this anime truly is a 'masterpiece'.

                I took me 9 years to finally force myself to watch Steins:Gate. I had been putting it off since the anime looked so dull and I didn't care much for time travel shows of any kind. But since I had nothing to watch and it had risen to #2 on the MAL charts, I had to at least see what everybody has been hyped about for all this time. And boy was it the biggest disappointment imaginable. After ten episodes, I called it quits.
The show is ostensibly about time travel, but the main time travel plot has very little substance or consequence and is simply
                  just a setup for a lame harem with sex jokes, childish prattle, and mad scientist role-play, all set in one small ""lab"". Time travel is about as important as the pizza delivery or the pool cleaning in a bad porno. You have all the typical anime tropes competing for the male protagonist, from tsundere to moe. There's even a transgender female (through the magic of time travel) to spice things up. 19 minutes out of a 20 minute episode is nothing but inane, cringe-inducing drivel, the type you'd find in any club-based school anime comedy if all the members were replaced by a mindless harem.
If you've seen Re:Zero, this is basically a predecessor to that show and made by the same studio. You see all the most annoying aspects of Re:Zero laid out in a more primitive form here. Kyouma, the MC, is analogous to Subaru, with the same exact personality traits. His excessive grandstanding, boasting, exaggerated movements, and even disgusting laugh match Subaru to a T. You have the same lab and Akihabara setting repeated over and over again, just like the mansion in Re:Zero after each death. You even have the same complete lack of music or a music budget of any kind.
One of the reasons I avoided the anime was because of it's aesthetic. The highly bleached look, zero background music, and Kyouma's long face made it appear like some cult niche show with a time travel plot too complex for me to enjoy. In reality, it's completely the opposite. I don't know if it gets better or the whole time travel thing ever gets fleshed out in any meaningful way, but so far, after ten episodes, which is more than enough to judge it, I was completely bored to death from the very beginning and utterly underwhelmed with it's complete lack of depth and lazy attempt at horror. It's a kid in an adult's body trying to play mad scientist with a microwave oven while he builds his harem each episode. It's not clear if he's even a college student or has any sort of scientific background. He is utterly SHOCKED each time something changes unexpectedly around him because he meddled with the past. You can also easily confuse him by dangling a set of keys in his face then quickly hiding it behind you. Let's not even talk about the conveniently changing criteria for sending D-mail over cellphone. If all you want is to watch a vapid slice of life school harem anime in black and white, you are better off picking one of the much cuter looking ones, muting the sound, and reducing your monitor colorspace to monochrome.",1

                When you mention Steins;Gate, you're bringing up one of the great masterpieces of anime. Period. Half slice-of-life/romantic comedy, half Sci-Fi thriller, Steins;Gate takes the concept of time travel and the morality surrounding it and transfixes its audiences, enough so that it currently grabs hold of 2nd Place on the MyAnimeList ""Top Anime"" Poll. It's likely where you first saw it, and now you're wondering just what makes it so popular. Well this isn't your run-of-the-mill, time travel drama. It takes the archetype and runs with it, leaving a moving and memorable story in its wake. My (obviously) personal favorite, Steins;Gate is a must see for
                  anyone, those interested in anime for the first time or those who style themselves aficionados of the anime scene.
Story: 11/10 (Yes, an '11.' I can not understate how good this is.)
Told from the point of view of self styled ""Mad Scientist,"" Okabe Rintarou, Steins;Gate is about, you guessed it: time travel. But in a way it's not really about that. It's about the person Okabe Rintarou, the relationships he has and builds during the show, and how his discovery and misuse of a time machine slowly breaks both down. In this show, you watch a man crack from the morality of the decisions he has to make in order to keep not only his life, but the future, stable. While this paints the picture of a very serious show, the first half of the anime actually is much like a slice-of-life where comedy and romance rule. Discovery of the time machine is initially pretty entertaining for Okabe (aka mad scientist 'Hououin Kyouma') and his 'Lab Members.' However, this makes you feel all the more for the characters as the second half takes the story for a plunge into drama. Being a hard science fiction show, the science and history behind everything can be a little intense, but things are usually explained pretty well without making you feel like you're watching a lecture. It's pretty cool when you see all the real life connections, such as John Titor, SERN (CERN), and Akihabara. While I won't tell you if the story has a sad or happy ending, it is very well done and while a teeny bit confusing, left me feeling pretty satisfied. Some people feel that there are small plot holes in the show, but they are explained away fairly well if re-watched and the internet explains it well if you end up somewhat confused. There are also side stories and a sequel OVA and movie if you're interested. Probably the only two negatives of the plot are that the first half is pretty slow, a low point being episode 4, and later on, the show seems to dedicate one episode each to each (mostly) female member, a by-product of originally being a visual novel. While these suit the story-line and can't be just taken out, you can sense a tinge of the harem/multiple-love-interest trope and it feels a little unnecessary. Yet overall, the quality and intensity of the story is basically unmatched by any other animations I've come across.
Art: 8/10
Unfortunately not quite the lovely visuals of the original visual novel. The art really doesn't stand out positively or negatively. It seems to suit the atmosphere of 'scientific endeavor,' with lots of matte colors and sharp edges. Gray dominates a lot of city scenes. Yet it does its best to fit the tone, with interesting transition scenes during the actual time travel and drops or additions to the color palette depending on the intensity of the scene. Because there isn't a whole lot of fast pace action, there aren't any real dips in quality, but, again, nothing stands out particularly either. For those of you worried or curious about fan-service, there really are only one or two minor scenes and even they have some small plot association (there is some perverted humor, though.) The art is definitely not the draw to the series, but it's not bad by any means, either. 
Sound: 8/10
We all know the real question here is Sub vs Dub. Honestly, both have their perks. For the sub, the voice actors are very good, especially Okabe's, the romantic lines are better, and Japanese tends to fit the pacing of the show better. On the other hand, the dub has fairly good voice acting as well, and the jokes have been translated to English much more effectively in the dubbed version. I like to watch both.
The music itself is pretty absent in parts of the show. You tend not to notice it, or you notice it's lack. This is artistically done, so I personally feel it doesn't draw away from the show, and instead adds to it. It really suits the mood established by the art: 'scientific endeavor.' The opening theme is pretty good, but nothing to laud about either. The ending theme is hardly worth mentioning. Nothing about it stands out. Yet despite all this minor negativity, the show feels really secure in its tone, and comes off quite well overall, even if not all that noticeably.
Characters: 9/10
Characters can make or break a show. While this one has several memorable ones, such as the ""hacka"" Daru (Itaru), the ""part time warrior"" Suzuha, and my favorite, the ""zombie tsundere"" Kurisu, the story really only follows the protagonist Okabe. Since he is the only one who can remember the alternate timeline during time travel, he is the only one who has any real character development during the show. This isn't really a bad thing, since the show really delves deep into his psyche. Initially, Okabe is flamboyant and embarrassingly entertaining as the mad scientist ""Hououin Kyouma,"" who takes care of his ""Future Gadget Laboratory"" with childhood friend Mayuri and developer Daru. This facade slowly unravels as he deals with the problems of time travel and his love interest in Kurisu. Kurisu, the main female lead, is voted ""best girl"" in many online polls. The definition of a tsundere, she is likable and helpful to the story, the brains behind the time machine. The romance that sprouts between her and Okabe, while pretty corny sometimes, is almost as intense as a pure romantic comedy. Their banter back and forth drives a lot of my personal entertainment from the series. Unfortunately the English dub somewhat botches the romantic lines, and is one of the main differences between the sub and dub. But like I mentioned before, the entertainment derived from the dramatic second half of the show is underlined BECAUSE the characters are really enjoyable and time is taken to get to know each of them. It's easy to care about all of them, so when things go downhill, and do they go downhill, you can easily get caught up in it.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Hands down best anime ever. By now I've seen around 40 of them, and it's still number one. So it's obvious I enjoyed the heck out of it. It's one of the few that I've seen both subbed and dubbed, and even then have re-watched. No one I have introduced it to has disliked it. Once you get a certain way halfway through, you will absolutely marathon the second half. Only things I personally disliked about the show were the high voice of Akiha and Mayuri's incessant babble ""Tuturu,"" which in a way was a little endearing. Somewhat. Still, this anime made me laugh, cry, and gasp in shock. It made me think about the morality of decisions and it made me really feel for the characters. 
Overall: 10/10",10

                Steins; Gate is a quasi-thriller with two or more interpretations. The first and most obvious, is that of time travel and the corresponding powerlust and regret. The second, which isn't commented on often: that of adolescent pursuit of love. This seemed pretty apparent to me; However, I can't speak for others. So I'll be terse in my evidence--and cryptic: 
1)Okabe is initially very pompous. 
2)Okabe gradually meets more and more girls
3)Once Okabe gets to know them well; they use the D-mail and he lives in their ""reality""
4)Okabe moves from one reality to the next and suffers from his mistakes
5)Okabe goes back and rectifies each ""reality""
                  in turn, thus reconciling with each girl and becoming mature, himself.
6)Eventually Okabe, finds the right girl after learning from his mistakes
If you just take out all the time machines (and other time paraphernalia) it leaves you with...something pretty romantic
...Thought I'd throw a change of pace out there
Edit: 
As for the specs of the show...
Like most thrillers the story is quintessential--and fortunately, it's pretty good. In fact, it was the biggest encouragement to finish the series. The conflict was stressful, the solution enticing, and the progression, at times, shocking. The main complaint I have is the conclusion. But  too many series implode after such a buildup, so I can overlook most misgivings. There were a few hiccups and science gaffes, but those were pretty petty. Story: 10
I hesitate to call the art beautiful but I'll gladly say it's consistent. Besides that, the quality of storyboarding is above average. The scenes flow near-seamlessly. Art: 8
The music is suitable but not stunning. However, the voice acting is what sold me. Miyano, Mamoru did an excellent job with Okabe--and not only him I give props to the entire Japanese cast. I have yet to see the English dub, so I cannot comment.
Sound: 9
The characters are...tragic. and through those tragedies they garner some emotional expenditure; but truly, a lot of the characters are pretty pale (static). Do not misunderstand me: each character has lovable/detestable points...what I'm saying is they lack true depth and growth. The most colorful character is Okabe and I am glad. Without his character development, time-traveling would be pretty pointless.
Character: 7
I feel this facet of the review is more opinion than the others, so I'll briefly explain. I thoroughly enjoyed the show. I liked the humor early in the show and the tension mid-way through. The latter episodes of the show prevent a higher rating
Enjoyment: 9",8

                For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed.
1.Art - The art for this anime was rather average in style and i could find the same style of art in many other anime, but the thing that set the art apart is the fact that not everyone was depicted as perfect looking.  Some of the characters had traits like being fat or very tall.  This is how Steins;Gate made it's self unique when compared to other styles.  I'd like to say
                  that the way the characters are drawn is average, but the physical attributes of the characters set it apart and thats why I give Steins;Gate an 8 in art.
2.Sound - I'm just gonna say that at first i didn't dig the intro: it felt to techno and didn't seem very together in it's rhythm.  That said, after a while the intro grew on me and it ended up being one of my favorite intros.  As for the soundtrack... it did everything perfectly.  It showed emotion where it needed to and told the story just as well as the characters.  I can gladly give sound a 10.
3.Character - The characters in this anime are some of the best I've ever seen.  I liked every single one of the characters and it was amazing to watch the characters change as the story went into its later phases.  I found myself getting more attached to the characters with every episode; especially Okabe.  I could feel the same feelings Okabe felt and I became very invested to the character.  It was almost like he became a part of me.  I give the characters in Steins;Gate a score of 10 because of the intense change in personality of them and the attachment you can develop with them.
4.Story - The story for Steins;Gate is the best I have ever invested in.  Not much can be said other than it being amazing.  You find yourself being sucked in to the story and I found myself being sad or happy even when i wasn't watching the anime.  The only problem I had with the story is that sometimes I found it to complex, be it one or two times.  Sometimes I had to pause the episode and think about what was going on, but this is also natural for an anime about time travel shenanigans.  I am giving the story a 10 because of how it was a complicated and emotional roller coaster.
5.Enjoyment - I enjoyed Steins;Gate thoroughly.  It sucked me into it's world and the struggles of the characters became my own struggles.  I haven't enjoyed an anime this much for a while.  I give a 10 for enjoyment because of how it attracted me to it's self over time.
This anime is an overall 10.
*I would recommend this anime to a person of any age.
Caution:
!Keep in mind this anime has mild gore.",10
"
                NO SPOILERS
The Steins;Gate is a must-to-watch. I explain:
Story(10) The story is just outstanding, the first part of the anime is punctuated with fun parts and the story is simply going(but it's still interesting). The second part of the anime is just mind-blowing, Okabe Rintarou grow up, become a very deep character despite his appearance. I strongly recommend to not inform yourself about the myth of John Titor before watching this anime or you'll  less ""be flat out"" in the story, but don't worry if you already know this myth: it won't ruin the story!!
Art(8) The drawings are good, the animation is also fluid nevertheless
                  they aren't outstanding.
Sound(9) All the soundtrack of Steins;Gate fit perfectly with the animation and the story. I think that's the point which give this ""power of mind-blowing"" to this anime!
Character(9) At first look, the characters seem very simple and classics but you'll be quickly surprised by the depth of their personality!
Enjoyment and Overall(10) I repeat it, Steins;Gate is breath-taking in all points. I really like this kind of anime which can change your vision of life, I mean you aren't the same person after watching Steins;Gate!",10
"
                After dropping Steins;Gate more than 3 times I decided to rewatch it and finish everything once and for all. 
Now..After finishing everything.. My brain can't process any longer so I'll just make this review as short as possible. This is a spoiler-free review consisting of the entire Steins;Gate series ( so both routes and the movie ). 
Route 1 ( Steins;Gate ) : 
Psychological-heavy. 
Route 2 ( Steins;Gate 0 ) : 
Depression and tear-jerker. 
Movie : 
Character development extension ( romance, additional explanation, etc. ) 
Steins;Gate was astounding. What makes it so good is the fact that everything links. It's like watching Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi movie but several times as it just keeps on linking and linking and linking everything just makes more sense as everything proceeds. 
I don't know what to say. Honestly I'm lost for words. I thought this anime was overrated but I was so wrong. People HAVE to watch this show. It was SUPER awesome.",10
"
                This Anime is simply majestic an anime full of mystery, full of timelines, full of a lot of science but hey better start with the analysis of this great Anime. First Animation is simply too good not much but looks good with the style of Anime that is the only thing I do not like this section was blood in many scenes is very fake blood or simply ignoring it is bad but this pretty good, the plot is the best part of this simply Animate a very interesting and very good story from start to finish the only problem I saw not so much
                  for me but for many other people is that they leave in the first chapters that the top looks like a simple slice of life but I think this is because many are not aware of the topics covered in mostly science (Jonh titor, time lines, loops, lines of divergence, etc) which I personally I do not pass me because if he was aware of these issues because I like xD but hey, the characters they are just really good a large part of them that I love these in if it was their reactions (Jutting those of Okarin) before the situations that are very real example of this is the same mental fatigue that Okarin is having throughout the entire series that is noticed very slowly as would happen normally and not suddenly as in other Animes or Mangas (Tokyo Ghoul). In conclusion a very good Anime that without doubt would put in my top favorite animes. 
Rating: 10/10",10

                This anime is AMAZING!
Steins;Gate is 1 of the 2 anime i have ever given a 10 this is based solely on my own tastes however. Amazing story telling, top notch art, beautiful music, great character development, and overall enjoyable. In the end the story felt fullfilled and couldnt have had a better ending line. It has anything you could want from an anime Action, Comedy, and just the right amount of romance. It starts of a tad bit slow but very necessary for you to get the full affect of late story. If you havent watched it i strongly suggest you do, its about scientists
                  who make a time travel device, people! 
10/10 all the way.",10

                Steins;Gate: a poor adaptation.
Art (3/10): One of Steins;Gate weakest points is the art, it does nothing but the basic, not memorable at all. Steins;Gate anime has very dark/grey backgrounds, almost lifeless and lazily done, doesn't fit with the story at all and gives a monotonous ambient to the watcher, even the most important places of the story follows this same boring and unoriginal aesthetic, and this is not nitpicking at all, its recurrent in the whole anime. There is quite a lot of moments where the animation stops to a still frame, this normally wouldn't be a problem because it's okay to do this for
                  comic/suspense purposes and such, but the problem is how this is done, very exaggerated and unnecessary, wasting precious episode time, I would let this pass if it was only one time or another, but this is repeated during almost all episodes. The character design is what saves it, following the Visual Novel quite well, you can clearly see how unique and well designed each character is, good attention to the clothing as well.
Sound (6/10): Good OP/ED, but I can't say much for the rest of original anime music, not really memorable and it's overshadowed by the great original VN soundtrack (that is used in the anime as well). Good job by the voice actors, except for the one who voiced Itaru, I didn't like his representation of the character, it felt too forced to be comic.
Character (6/10): The characterization is pretty solid, but for some characters it lacks depth, which is kinda to be expected since there is a fair number of characters and it's a adaptation of a 40~60 hours Visual Novel. Personality wise the characters complement each other very well other and they are one of the best points in Steins;Gate, but some characters really needed more development to truly complement the story.
Story (3/10): Story is the great point of Steins;Gate series, very original and enjoyable, but it is badly handled in this anime. The first half episodes does no set the tone of the story, the art, as mentioned early, doesn't help either, very monotonous setting, some crucial parts of the story are wrongly chosen to be skipped, what make it ever worse, it takes too much time to solidify the story, to give it any direction. The anime also does a bad job explaining the mechanisms of the story (all the time travelling and stuff), which are of tremendous importance to the story, and that set back a lot of watchers of this series as well. Once the story advances to the critical points, it gets better, I wont go further to not spoil it, but overall very bad storytelling.
Enjoyment (1/10): Personally I couldn't enjoy Steins:Gate since it's a really incompetent adaptation with all the flaws mentioned above, having already read the Visual Novel before watching the anime, I can not set this fact aside in this part of the review, because I watched it as a adaptation (how it is). I think you will not enjoy the series if you have already read the Visual Novel, but if you have zero interest in the VN you probably enjoy it and maybe have a blast, otherwise I strongly recommend reading the Visual Novel first, it was a great experience.",3
"
                To be honest, I was not really interested in the story but rather, I was wondering why the ratings of this series makes this series as one of the best ones of all time. 
Wait please.. at least hear me out. I'm not someone who watches anime just because it's popular. 
What I'm trying to say is that how can a common plot be any different than from those Sci-Fi series that have been released in the past decade? With the configurations of time travel, resets and changing timelines that have been overused in different series, what can Steins;Gate offer that no other series can't?
                  
First, we'll talk about the story. I shouldn't write spoilers since it's in the rules and I've already got a warning in one of the reviews I made so it really can't be helped. The best word to describe the series was that it was amazing. With the flow of the story, it can make you forget about cliches and predictable moments since this series is a Thriller and a great one at that. This is a series you can't watched half-assed because the progression gives you the reaction of "" Oh.. it all makes sense now.."" and the story is maybe not what you think it will be. Time travel is a very confusing and difficult plot so re-watching is recommended if you can't keep up with the pace and understand the story better. One thing I admire is that from before  I started watching this series, I was expecting it to be a serious type but then... this is actually really funny especially if you're someone who's knowledgeable about physics and the likes of science fiction. Though the plot is a given, the story is very unique and I don't think it gave me the feeling of ""I've seen this before."" The only thing I saw coming was the repetition of scenes after the use of time-travel. But.. that's mostly no sh*t. I really like the way this story has progressed with how a... normal?.. maybe happy-go-lucky life of the characters have become into something completely unexpected and how it was shown what would become if curiosity got the better of you. 
The art is spectacular. I recall that some of the series that were released during 2011 look far from Steins;Gate. I'm really amazed by the amount of detail put into the backgrounds and scenes. This particular art style is also very unique and one glance is all it takes for you to identify it as Steins;Gate. 
The soundtrack goes really well with the scenes and it gives the perfect ambiance. Opening and Endings are really nice and emotional. 
For the characters... I really enjoyed the delusions the main character has and how everyone around him seems to think it's just normal. The delusions just get funnier every episode and some reactions are just too priceless. But what I commend the most is the development each character has made and their acceptance to reality or the world as we know it. 
I don't need to say how much I enjoyed this series because I'm sure that everyone who watched this did too. For an anime that I thought was serious from beginning to end, I never expected the hidden genres that this show hides from the ones who haven't seen it yet. Having just Sci-Fi and Thriller only tagged in descriptions is a bit stirring, but you'll get a lot more than that since Steins;Gate actually offers more than it should have. 
For the viewers that happen to stopped watching mid-way, I should tell you to get back to watching and just finish it. I know there's a lot to take in each episode so just suck it up and see it through the end. Steins;Gate has one of the best stories and we are lucky to be alive to hear about it in this generation.",10

                Hello Readers!
It's been a while since I last wrote a review and since I was active on this site.
Anyway I had to write something about Steins Gate.
Steins Gate is an anime like no other.
I highly recommend it to everyone who likes a good thriller anime with tons of humor and a deep and intelligent storyline.
Story:
Steins gate is about time traveling and there are a lot of books and movies about this subject and there is no movie or book without any flaws, but that does not matter with this anime. The anime starts of rather slow I found myself watching the first two episodes three
                  times until I finally put myself into watching the remaining. 
And man I was mad that I didn't put myself to watch it in a single ride.
The story starts of so light and funny but it builds the tension so beautifully. It's the kind of story that gives you the impression you watching something  cute but then takes a dark turn all of a sudden where you find yourself scared late at night cause of the discoveries they make.
And this tension builds man does it build! Like the main protagonist you as well go mad with the things that happen. Is it real? What is time? What is going on? And as the story goes on it becomes more tragic and I never had to cry with an anime or any book or movie in my life but this was the first time I felt something come up. I held it in but this anime has it all. The characters, the story, the sound, the visual direction it all fits in one heavy ride that will change the way you think like only a few other animes can do.
Characters:
Where to start, anime in it's whole has a lot of clich√©s when it comes to characters so as a hardcore anime watcher I was surprised how they finally made a character that had as much impact on me as L from Death Note. This mad Doctor who is the main protagonist of this show is witty, insane, brilliant and a complete loser. Never ever have I seen such a good character development in an anime but this anime showed me how a man can change if he is on the edge of losing everything.
Now the supporting cast contains, the cute young girl, the witty smart sidekick who looks very confident but isn't and the pervert. But don't let this fool you, you will love these characters they might sound clich√© but they are the good kind of clich√©. The jokes are brilliant never obvious, the dialog is always clever and in the end you will miss these bunch of misfits when the anime ends.
Sound:
I can be short on this one, it adds tension it's good I'm not an expert on sound or the right use of sound. But yea if you love the sound of the higurashi insects like I do you will love the subtleness of this anime.
Art:
I believe I mentioned it before but it's amazing, I want to add this the art made everything so much scarier. There is a lot of brightness in the art and also much emptiness and this feeling of scarcity or abandonment is what it makes so intense to watch. 
Enjoyment:
The first two episodes feel a bit slow but they are funny and well if you read this review you will hopefully understand that it's worth watching the entire anime because it's a amazing ride from beginning till the end. One of the best anime I have ever seen in my life and unique in it's genre.
I rate this anime the highest of the highest 10/10
And I rarely give anything that kind of review. 
In it's greatness it can be compared to Death Note, Code Geass and FMA Brotherhood but it's unique in it's own way.
Enjoy!",10

                Over indulgent, time-travel drivel. It has no sense of drama, atmosphere or pacing, and after four episodes of flat characters fucking about with a microwave, I had to drop it. The writing did nothing whatsoever to distinguish itself early on, besides dropping monumentally unsubtle foreshadowing, and very low brow humour to supplement lack of character development. 
And when the visual colour palette is pitch blue and grey almost exclusively, grew tired I decided that the story, visuals and direction was so un-compelling that another 20 episodes or so, would no be worth my time. 
I'm sure if I had continued the show may have taken
                  some unexpected turns, but for somebody who finds time-travel to be a huge masturbatory cliche, this show is a big no.",4
"
                Steins Gate is a story based on a visual novel named with the same name and the anime is produced by White Fox.
In 2010, Japan, a 'mad scientist' named Okabe Rintar√¥ and self-proclaimed Kyoma Hoonin found other scientist named Makise Kurisu brutally murdered when he went to a conference about time machines. He sent an e-mail and he accidentally travelled to the past, but not to the normal past, a different past. Something could have change? Okabe could solve this enigma?
The anime begins with an amazing first chapter followed by a terrifying opening, the first episode ends with in my a opinion an ending that
                  I consider a masterpiece. The characters are very complex. The plot is very interesting, a mature story, very complicated, and with a coherence that shocked me since the first episode. The development of this anime is simply stunning and could be for you one of the best anime ever created. The soundtrack has very nice pieces. Finnally the stress that you will feel when you will be watching the finnal episodes is absolutly unforgettable.
In my opinion this anime is a masterpice, gorgeous: 10",10

                I fail to understand why this series is so acclaimed. I went into it with high expectations, but by the end of it I was so bored of the characters and the story. I kept thinking, ""when is this supposed to get good"" and before I knew it I'd finished the series.
 I get it; time travel is a fascinating plot element by itself, and Steins;Gate seems to have pioneered some new ideas, but nevertheless I never once felt like it subverted my expectations. There was no ""epiphany moment"" for me; it was boring all the way through. 
This is controversial, but the characters are
                  so boring, and the main character Okarin is so painfully unlikable with his fake ""mad scientist"" antics, that I was rarely, if at all, emotionally invested. It just felt like it was hitting all these pre-established tropes to appeal to a certain demographic, not trying to tell a unique story. 
Overall I give it a 5/10. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I watched it when I was 13, but watching this at age 26 was a chore.",5

                ****Warning! Spoilers in this review****
So less than 24 hours after finishing Steins;Gate I feel obliged to write a review for it (and no I didn't do any time leaps or send any D-Mails to give myself more thinking time).
Before I begin, I'll be honest with you. I tried as much as I could to find something wrong with this anime while reviewing it. Why? Because a disturbing trend has emerged where new, decent-but-not-superb shows in recent seasons are ranking easily into MAL's top 30 (and Steins;Gate appeared to be one of them). And personally I don't think that's a good thing.
Anyway...prejudices aside, Steins;Gate did prove
                  me wrong. To an extent. Nevertheless, I would like to firmly disagree with the countless Steins;Gate fanboys out there that this is MAL top 3 material, because I would not classify this as a masterpiece.
Story (8/10) - In a nutshell, Okabe and his friends/amateur-like lab members build a somewhat unconvincing case of a time leap machine and are getting chased by SERN.Between most of the 24 episodes, the plot seems reasonably well connected, as we progress between different world lines, where things change little by little until one of Okabe's closest friends, Mayuri, ends up being fated to die. But while this sad fate provides numerous tearjerking moments for fans as we see Mayuri getting killed over and over again, it does become very repetitive.
However, that isn't my main issue with the plot of Steins;Gate. The main problem is that some loose ends weren't tied up properly. Especially that of SERN's involvement and the role of Mr Braun. Perhaps the weakest part of the story over the whole 24 episodes was Mr Braun's involvement with the Rounders. If he knew about Okabe's time machine for so long, why didn't he act immediately as a Rounder instead of sending ""threatening"" images to Okabe's phone. Why did he give the lab members the message from Suzuha Hashida at all? His role doesn't make sense at all.
And this leads to an even broader problem: is it really that convincing for SERN (the unseen antagonists) to only use Braun's team to stop Okabe? Assuming that they were the ones who stopped the trains in preparation for the attack on the lab, I was expecting them to pull a greater show of force in later episodes. Which didn't happen.
Episodes 23 & 24 are also too contrived for an anime that covered deeper themes for the first 22 episodes. If Steins;Gate had ended with Episode 22, Makise would have performed the ultimate sacrifice for the whole world, and I wouldn't have been disappointed. But the fact that Amane comes back just so that Okabe's selfish desires to keep everyone alive was fulfilled just didn't make it as enjoyable for me. No offence guys, but it reeked of typical shounen after that.
Art (8/10) - There's not too much to talk about here. Against other anime aired in 2011, the graphics are pretty stock-standard (obviously much easier on the eyes than something from the '90s). Okabe's reactions to his time leap moments were particularly memorable, as they did suggest some feeling of disorientation. Character art was ordinary (though thankfully no unrealistic body proportions....I'm looking at you HotD), but I still don't feel that the appearances of Mayuri, Ruka and Feyris blended in correctly with the underlying themes that Steins;Gate was trying to convey. The blood in Makise's stab scene didn't look particularly realistic/gruesome so I didn't relate to Okabe's worsening of his own injury in the last episode.
Sound (8/10) - Yes, there were times when the sound did enhance the element of suspense, and this was most evident when Okabe received those .jpgs on his phone. But considering I watched Kara no Kyoukai 5: Mujun Rasen recently, I can't say that SG's sound was nearly as impressive. The OP by Kanako Itou and ED by Yui Sakakibara are at best a decent fit for Steins;Gate...I wouldn't consider them outstanding.
Character (9/10) - Okabe's character development is by far the most interesting in Steins;Gate. From something of a clown in the early episodes, he does engage in personal growth, especially when he had to ensure that all the D-Mails were undone one by one. He joked less about the Organisation during episodes 15-20 and ironically became more distant to Mayuri even though he was endlessly trying to save her. His multidimensional character was quite well done, if we remember that shounen protagonists usually tend to be blatant idiots who remain blatant idiots (ie Natsu from Fairy Tail) or are pitiful weaklings who remain pitiful weaklings (Shinji from NGE and almost every damn male protagonist I've come across in shounen romance manga).
Other characters' development, however, were abandoned as a result. Mayuri pretty much stayed innocent yet internally mournful of her grandma's death etc etc, while Amane, Ruka, Moeka and Feyris didn't get enough quality screentime to ensure they became anything more than one-dimensional characters.
The biggest issue I have though is with Makise Kurisu's character. Believe what you want to believe Kurisu-chan fanboys, but she isn't really a tsundere. I don't find her attempts to act cold and hostile to anything near natural, as for 90% of the time she is majorly provoked by Okabe's insults. I'm sure that if you replaced her with any other sensible, intelligent female character from another anime, they too would have acted the same way towards Okabe after taking only so much of his Hououin Kyouma crap. Hence, she's not a tsundere (please search Rie Kugimiya's roles, the names Senjougahara and Asuka Langley Soryu for more information). I also truly think that her gradually developing 'romance' with Okabe is a bit forced, and that it would have suited the plot more if they had remained as friends rather than sharing that kiss (plus that chance meeting in Akibahara was so cliched).
Enjoyment (9/10) - It was good while it lasted. I don't see why else I would watch 21 episodes of Steins;Gate in one day. But then again, that's just me. It wasn't until I started thinking about what actually happened that cracks started to appear.
Overall (9/10) - Like I said before, SG isn't a masterpiece. But I wouldn't have given it such a high score already if I wasn't impressed by what it did and tried to do as an anime from 2011. The time travel theme hasn't been covered so much in anime that it's been done to death like the lousy-ordinary-kid-becoming-the-best-in-the-world-at- storyline.
So while it certainly isn't in the top 3 anime of all time by my standards (maybe not even in the top 10), I can safely say that it ranked in the top 3 of the season in which it aired. Only time will tell as to whether this becomes a well-acknowledged sci-fi classic like Cowboy Bebop or GitS, but until then (probably 3-5 years down the track) it's too early to decide.
For the furious Steins;Gate-is-God fanboys who are already raging at me from their keyboards, I will say that on a more exact scale this anime would fall between 8.5-8.8 out of 10, and that if this was the first anime I ever watched, I would most certainly have given it a 10 (like I did with Code Geass which btw is superior to SG).",9

                If I had to review this anime in short, my words would be: exciting, smart, serious and yet funny, and most importantly FUN.
STORY
If you're interested in the story just check out the synopsis, I'm not going to go into details, since it would spoil your entertainment too much. It's about a group of people who accidentally discover a basic form of time travel. They can't travel trough time themselves, but they can send things back (although the result is not too beautiful, everything becomes a green gel-like thing) and later on they discover that via SMSes they can even send messages back in a limited
                  interval.
I believe the pacing is just great, you never get bored, yet you get to know everyone, it really is perfect. One of the best things about the story is its transformation, there is a distinct point where from being mostly funny and comical everything becomes serious. The 10/10 rate is a no brainer, really.
ART
Now this is one beautiful anime. The first thing you're going to notice is that everything is detailed enough to make you feel like you're part of the story. Then comes some grainy, washed out filter (barely noticeable, really, it won't disturb you if you're not into it), and all of the sudden you feel like leaving the streaming site you're on and getting (by which I mean buying, obviously, we're not animals! ;) ) it in high definition, and believe me, it's worth it.
Personally I think that the visuals are on par with Ergo Proxy, which in my opinion has one of the best visuals around. All in all, 10/10 for sure.
SOUND
Now this is something I can't say too much about. I'm normally fine with anything as longs as it's nothing unbearably bad. All I can say is that the opening and closing themes are very good and go well with the atmosphere, and the voices of the characters are top notch, you can't stop smiling when you hear Feyris or Mayushii, they are so cute that you're going to heal from the worst depression after they say anyithing, really. 10/10, because I feel it deserves it, but I'm really no pro in this department.
CHARACTERS
Speaking of characters, wow... All of them are so detailed and multidimensional that even the last supporting character could get his/her own show. I'm not kidding, they're that good. I don't want to say anything about them specifically, but all of them have great and unique personalities, and they all have some character development trough the story. Of course the two ""mainest"" main characters, Okabe and Makise (The Zombie - I have no idea how she got that nickname) are top notch, unique, and have chemistry, which isn't always the fact. You just can't find anything to complain about in this department. I have to mention how great Okabe's character is in particular. The guy transforms from a mad scientist to a paranoid conspiracist to a caring big brother type so smoothly that you just KNOW that you would love him in real life. 10/10, no doubt.
ENJOYMENT
I don't think that I have to write too much about it. Great characters, awesome art, mind blowing story, what else would you need? 10/10
---
Overall:
I have to admit I didn't really feel fascinated about this anime when I decided to watch it. It's the 3rd on the list, but still, I thought that I would find it boring. But thankfully I started it anyways, since I have more time than anything else, and it was my best decision up to date in the anime world. I'll have to rewatch it to conclude wether it will kick Death Note from the throne for me, but the very fact that I find it to be in the same league as DN is something that I wouldn't have thought 2 days ago.
If you got this far with my review it means that you are at least a little bit interested in this anime. In which case just start the downloa... I mean go buy it right now and watch it, I'm certain that you will love it!",10

                At first when I saw the first 8-9 episodes I thought this series was boring, not going to lie, because the introduction to the series is slow due to the explanation that you need to know before diving in into the story later on in the series, but after you get over with that part, the rest is AMAZING! I MEAN OH MY GOD THE STORY, THE CHARACTERS AND THE MUSIC IN THIS IS SO AGH!! Without giving away too much spoilers its about this ""mad scientist"" named Okabe Rintarou (or as he likes to call himself, Hououin Kyouma) who tries to decease the ""Organization""
                  by inventing a time machine, with the help of his friends he makes it a posibility... But he was not aware of what was going to happen ahead of time. My favorite character would be Makise Kurisu because she is so funny and she ""fights"" with Okabe and has hilarious moments in the series and she is very pretty, in fact, I may have a crush on her, just saying though. So overall I recommend this anime to anybody who is in for a Sci-fi show, if your into time travel, or if you are a ""whovian"" (in which I'm very proud to say I am one). Also if your looking for a good psychological thriller this would be a great anime for your taste, and you will probably enjoy it as much as I did. The only flaw in this masterpiece series is, as I said before, it has a slow start due to explanations so you don't get confused later on in the plot and to develop characters to hit you right in the feels later on, but after this long 8-9 ""explanation"" episodes, I guarantee you will enjoy the shit out of this show. Have a nice day!",9

                I played Steins;Gate last weke(or maybe 'read' since it is a VN) and had this urge to watch Steins;Gate again.
If you see the ';' in the name then it's probably from 5bp., the company that also created Robotics;Notes, Chaos;Head. Steins;Gate 0, the second game in the Steins;Gate series, is going to be released next week on Dec'10. Also, it's anime has been green-lit and it will air sometime in 2016. It will supposedly follow the storyline where Okabe failed to save Makise Kurisu.
The first time i watched Steins;Gate it sent chills down my spine every time the worldline changed(that was simply amazing, playing the game
                  also gave me the same sensation maybe because i had already forgotten most of the story). After playing the game i realized just how much shallower the story is compared to the original story, but that is also to be expected as ~25 hrs of gameplay(for the true ending, others take relatively less time) has been stuffed into 24 episodes. All the complicated things that are in the story like the time travel theory as well as what kerr black holes are, how time paradox is avoided oh, and also lifters(if you haven't heard what a lifter is, google 'lifter ionocraft') as well as how they are directly connected to SERN are in the original story but has been removed to cater to a wider audience(maybe). Also, some of the scenes in the game have been changed to make it fit into the anime. The scenes that do change however don't really effect the overall balance of the story.
The part that is the most different from the original story is Mr. Braun's story. Nae doesn't play any role in the story and a backstory has been added to Mr. Braun's past to make the story more realistic.
If you have read up till here and have still not watched Steins;Gate then stop reading this and go watch the anime RIGHT NOW, or you may continue reading this.
The main protagonist in the story is a Chuunibyou('Eighth Grader Syndrome'[1] or simply 'delusional') Okabe Rintarou who calls himself Hououin Kyouma(Houou as in Ho-oh, you know pokemon, which means 'Pheonix' or so it said in the game) and he's being supposedly chased by 'The Organization'(Kikan). And one more thing,  Chuuni's have a thing for 'power sealed in their eye and/or arm'(remember 'Burning Fighting Fighter' or 'Dark Flame Master'?). Hououin Kyouma also has a magic eye, it's name being 'Reading Steiner'(also a Chuuni name). You can hear more of these names throughout the story among which the first and foremost being 'Steins Gate'(it is supposedly a mix between German and English) and, oh i just love the next one, 'Stardust Handshake'(originally 'Stardust Shakehand' in Japanese??).
If you were to change the past, every small action stacks up which in term causes a large effect with time. The Butterfly Effect, which is one of the most feared effect of time travel has been depicted very well. To prevent time paradox, all the past event leading to that point in time will be altered to match what the observer sees that is every persons memory is altered so that they do not perceive the change that took place. But since Okabe Rintarou has 'Reading Steiner' he is able to retain his memories even after the worldline has changed. Ignorance is bliss and with knowledge comes responsibility. Since Okabe is the only one who retains his memories and also because he is the one who created the time machine, he takes it upon himself to save Shiina Mayuri whose death has been decided by fate. If you were the one who gave happiness to someone by changing their past and if you should undo the past and steal their happiness, would you be able to do it? As the creator of the time machine and because he is the only person who retains his memories between time lines, it is the responsibility of Okabe Rintarou to change the world to the way it was.
Since the world is round like a ball, even if we walk separate paths, as long as we keep going forward... we'll definitely meet again one day.(from Digimon Xros Wars) Could you say this line to the one form whom you are going to part from?  Would you give others happiness just to steal it away from them? Could you sacrifice others memories or relationships to satisfy yourself? If you could send a mail and if that mail would erase a person, would you hesitate while pressing the send button?
Okabe has taken it upon himself to right all the changes that he has done to the past in order to save Mayuri which in turn saves the world. Starting with Amane Suzuha who came to 2010 to search for her father, Feryis NyanNyan who brought her father back to life, Urushibara Luka who chages his gender, Kiryuu Moeka who stole the IBN 5100 and finally the mail that started it all, Okabe Rintaro who brought Makise Kurise back to life. All of the mail must be undone in order to move onto the beta-timeline where the time machine hasn't been invented and SERN doesn't rule the world. Every parting that happens is really emotional and very good(really makes me want to just sit back and just think about it over and over again).
Words aren't enough to convey the feeling i felt then i watched Steins;Gate. How would you begin to define a series as a masterpiece? Because it made you cry, because it made you remember your childhood, because it gave you willpower, because it made you know what truly loving means?? For me, if i truly love an anime i wish that that anime would never end but an anime is only complete if it has an ending, these two feelings contradict each other. So i try to extend that anime as long as possible so that i can think back on the things that happened in that anime, so that i can remember it as long as possible, so that the feeling that i had when i watched that anime will never disappear from my memory. When i have these feelings, it is no exaggeration to say that is the time when i truly feel alive and believe i watch anime for that reason. In that sense, for me, Steins;Gate is a masterpiece.
Normally anime is bright and colorful to convey cheerfullness. But, Steins;Gate is closer to monochrome which gives a nice atmosphere to the story. Every small detail in the anime gives it a very nice feel and add up to make the anime closer to anything than a masterpiece. Never in this timline do i think i will ever find an anime based on time-travel that is this well depicted and can make me truly sad and sentimental and at the same time happy to see that the story has ended.

                * CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS*
I started watching this anime in one day and nearly finished in the next day. The story makes you feel attached to it.. you'll laugh, (kinda) cry and be serious about it. 
The main character of this anime (Okabe Rintarou) is really unique, since he's.. well.. a mad scientist, but a good person. As I told you before this anime will make you cry.. the main character starts out being crazy and really funny, but in the 2nd half of the anime he ends up being more crazy and depressed with the whole situation he  put himself into.He created a time-machine
                  that could leap messages through time.. and change the destiny of people's faith some for the best.. and some for the worst. 
All the characters are interesting (in my opinion), but I have some hate for some of them, but that's what makes the anime feel more real. 
The ending is one of the best things I have ever seen since Code Geass's ending although not nearly as EPIC of course, but still a great ending, very satisfying. I definitely recommend this anime for all of u, since I thought it sucked, I could have watched it years ago, but there was always other animes pilling up for me to watch, wich I thought were more interesting (they weren't). 
Overall i give this anime a 9 out of fkn 10! GOOD JOB  5pb and Nitroplus for creating a visual novel wich was born as an amazing anime! :)
Note: The OP of this anime is amazing although the part where it shines is in the end,  like the last 20 or 15 seconds of the song, it really gets you singing that part anywhere you go. 9.9/10 OP",9
"
                This is an anime. Faith in the anime world has been restored! With the recent anime genre going on recently (harem, ecchi, more harem, etc...) I haven't been watching much recently then I stumbled upon this and I am now a happy noodle.
What I like about this anime:
EVERYTHING! I admit on the first few episodes it was a bit dragging that it made me sleep on episode 3 (FORGIVE ME JOHN TITOR!!) but moving forward and making the effort to watch it has paid off. The twists were extraordinary, the art was beautiful & character development (hells yaaah!) was superb. The ending was well-made. It
                  explains everything that has happened and leaves you with a happy smile in your face (not like those cliff hangers that you need to continue reading on the manga). 
I absolutely recommend this anime to anyone and everyone. Just bear with the first few confusing episodes, it's gonna pay-off!",9
"
                Steins;Gate is one of the most interesting anime I have ever seen and I am surprised myself since normally i keep myself drawn to action and such, but now to the review.
Story: 10
Okabe Rintarou, or Hououin Kyouma (As he calls himself) the mad scientist, and the founder of a lab with 3 members. Himself, the cosplaying Shiina Mayuri and the otaku and hacker Hashida Itaru, and together they make the most useless invention possible. But wouldn't it be interesting if one of the inventions made it possible to send messages into the past. 
And this is where it all starts getting more and more complex
                  and kind of confusing. 
Art: 10
The art in this anime is very detailed but it uses a darker style which makes it fit perfectly for this anime due to it's darker themes. The characters is also well drawn which makes them all more likable. Can't point out anything bad.
Sound: 10
The sound is really great through the anime. The Opening ""Hacking Through the Gate"" by Itou Kanako and the Ending ""Tokitsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku"" by Sakakibara Yui is both very fitting and great soundtracks. And the background music is also fitting for the moment. As for the voice acting cast I must say that they picked some of my favorites seiyuus and I think that they made a outstanding job and they totally fit their characters.
Characters: 10 
The best part about this anime is without a doubt the characters. And what makes it better is that some characters is very special which makes them very likable.
Okabe Rintarou (Hououin Kyouma) is one hell of a wierd person, and if you knew him I do believe that you would like him very much or you would pretend that you didn't knew him at all since he no sense of shame whatsoever. He pretend that he is followed by an organization, he pretends to talk to someone through his cellphone, makes wierd laughs and ends conversations with ""El Psy Congroo"".
Hashida Itaru: The best friend of Okabe and is an otaku and a talented hacker. He is somewhat of a pervert both interested in both 2D and 3D girls. 
Shiina Mayuri: Also the best friend of Okabe. She is somewhat of an airhead and is likes making costumes for cosplay. She also works at a Maid Caf√© ""MayQueen+Nyan2"".
Makise Kurisu is a 18 year old girl with quite curious personality which is the reason she ends up working with the other lab members. She is very smart and has a lot of knowledge regarding science which makes her very important later in the series.
Enjoyment: 10 
It has been a quite a long time since I have been this excited by an anime that almost makes me stay indoor the entire day just waiting for a new episode to be released. But I am saddened now since it has come to and end but it was exciting 24 weeks and if you read this review, watch this anime and I think you will love it.
Overall: 10
Greatest anime 2011 and who knows when it will come a new anime that beats it, but everyone watch it now and you won't be disappointed.

                Story:
It's a somewhat interesting plot, microwave go brrr, time traveling, etc. but I feel like the way they paced it and put everything together is far too boring to be interesting in my opinion. 
Art: 
The art is what I think is the best thing about it, but it doesn't add up to much when the anime itself if boring (that goes for nearly every anime). 
Sound:
Nothing out of the ordinary, wasn't amazing but didn't make my ears bleed. Very forgetful, very average.
Character:
The worst thing about this anime by far. A boy that looks like a girl, wannabe mad scientist, air-headed cutie, unhealthy discord moderator,
                  the list goes on. It seems as though each characters stereotypes are the only personality they were given.
Enjoyment:
4/10, if i was on an airplane with no Wi-Fi and this was the only thing i had downloaded, I'd watch it, but it REALLY feels like a chore to do so. 
Overall:
I'm giving it a 4/10 instead of a 2/10 for the sake of everyone who enjoyed the anime. I don't think it deserves the ranking it got, but I'll edit this review if i change my mind IF I finish the anime. I wouldn't recommend to anyone, but i know some people enjoy it so idk.",4

                Moderator edit: This review contains mild spoilers. 
I feel compelled to write a review of Steins;Gate. For years I had it in the top spot in my list, only to be beaten out by Chihayafuru. But for years I've heard everyone claim that the show starts half way and the first half sucks. This is patently untrue, so rather than making this a comprehensive review, allow me to just dispel this aspect.
It was rather the first episode of Steins;Gate that caught my attention, and the second episode that cemented it (and the full action began by episode 4). To be sure, the first episode is
                  a mindfuck that you're not going to get until you watched the whole thing, and then rewatch it, and then rewatch it again. But it sets up the competency in the direction. The timing of the scene cuts and the atmospheric sound track, the juxtaposition from silence to a character speaking gave a cohesive vibe that indicates the author knows how he wants us to feel. The overexposure and high contrast, the black crushing, draws us in and, like Monogatari, asks us to question what's actually happening.
By the second or third episode, the show starts dropping some big names to let us know the scope of this epic. See, in this world, you're either scientifically-minded, care about the latest advances in technology and the boundaries of our knowledge, and follow the news to some extent, or you're simply clueless. And to be honest with you, if the name CERN or Large Hadron Collider (LHC) doesn't mean anything to you, then you might as well drop Steins;Gate. It isn't meant for you. You might enjoy the huge wtf-moments in the second half, but you'll never truly get it. And I say this not to be a snob, but to state without a doubt the amount of real-life references to both science and science-fiction culture that Steins;Gate incorporates. To be sure, the LHC is a 16.6 mile tunnel underneath Switzerland, wherein sometimes at night, the country would divert all of its electricity to run quantum experiments by creating a miniature black hole and recording data about its particles. CERN is the internationally respected European Center for Nuclear Research. 
And what Steins;Gate is saying, pretty early on, is that there is an international conspiracy to create a time machine that our protagonists accidentally discover. And only if you know what CERN is -- in real life -- can you appreciate the magnitude of the players in the first act.
The actual mechanics of the time machine is trash, and Steins;Gate suffers from the same physical and philosophical problems every other time machine science-fiction suffers. I won't bore you, but suffice to say, Steins;Gate isn't perfect, and if the physical absurdity of it bothers you, you probably wouldn't enjoy it. But I will say that unlike Chaos;Head, Robotic;Notes, Rascal Dreams of Bunny-girl Senpai, and nearly every other anime in its genre, Steins;Gate did remarkably well at shying away from as much bullshit techno-jargon as possible, only filling in what is necessary for the plot (the sequel failed on this front, in my opinion, which was partially responsible for the catapulting of Chihayafuru in my list, but I digress). There is remarkably a minimal number of plot holes here that I say is necessary for the function of any story about time travel. For example, how does Okabe maintain memory in between the jumps? The explanation in Steins;Gate is cliche, that he had a childhood near death experience. However, you have to appreciate that if no character retains memory during time travel, then every time travel fiction is moot. It's the structural problems we have to deal with in this genre.
Even with the flaws, what made Steins;Gate such a masterpiece is the consistent dramatic push -- if you understand where the tension comes from -- from the beginning -- not half-way through! -- that brings Okabe to the brink of an emotional breakdown, and then gives him the chance to recompose himself. The unrelenting tension is reminiscent of the first season of Death Note. And unlike Subaru from Re:Zero, the cause of Okabe's breakdown is not his own cringe-worthy social ineptitude (although he is socially awkward in general, he is recognized as such, and the show doesn't try to create cognitive dissonance from the difference in expectations). The breakdown is gradual, taking place in over half of the show, instead of as a post hoc inconsequential dramatic moment. And in the peak of it, the true plot twist happens, revealing the show to be of the romance genre. 
This wasn't the plot twist everyone talks about, but the plot twist everyone missed. Honestly, everyone who has some experience with anime sees the convention and understands, like Rem, someone would reach out to ""save"" Okabe. It's not that surprising, but it's beautiful in its execution, and it shows two characters developing trust over time. It wasn't the girl that inexplicably falls in love, which would make no sense considering that unlike Okabe and our experience through the protagonist, the other characters only experienced their world line once. But rather, Okabe himself is made to slowly open up. Now contrast that with Subaru being treated like Jesus!
Some people walk away from it thinking it's some kind of a time travel Inception, or that the first half of completely boring because they think the show is centered around Mayuri. It really isn't. And if they think that the ""inception"" is the start of the show when it's really the 3rd-4th act of 5 acts (the pinch point/crisis), then they've missed 60% of the setup.
Steins;Gate isn't really about time travel. It's a device, and yes, a device central to its plot. But first and foremost it's an underdog story about some nobodies taking on an international organization. And second (or maybe first), it's the most unlikely of love stories. It's a psychological thriller, one featuring one of the most gradual and complete mental breakdown in anime, and we're not talking about someone shown to suddenly snap like Yukiteru or Subaru, but the systematic removal of all hope over time (Texhnolyze may forever hold the champion spot in this category, but that's it). The time travel greases the wheels, but is not the vehicle itself. Calling Steins;Gate a show about time travel is like calling Attack on Titans a show about maneuvering gear. And if someone walked away from Attack on Titans thinking all the times when they weren't developing omni-directional mobility as inconsequential to the plot, then they missed the point in a big way.",10

                The problem with pulling off a good time travel series or movie is that they have to establish their own rules and then not break them, otherwise turning the plot into a bit of a contrived mess. Steins;Gate almost avoids this, but unfortunately, I felt it fell a bit short in that respect - I don't want to ruin anything so I won't discuss it further, but it was a decent effort. The voice acting is good, the story is alright, I don't have any complaints about the pacing, and the series was definitely funny when it wanted to be - perhaps its strongest point.
                  It does the drama-comedy mixture well, not going to far in one direction at a time.
I loved the protagonist, he was a really likeable character, and amazingly voiced. Most of them were, but I didn't enjoy Mayushi or Kurisu as much as the series wanted me too. Mayushi was just too over-the-top cutesy for the sake of being over-the-top cutesy while doing nothing for the plot. She felt a bit forced, what 16 year-old acts this way? Kurisu, who was on the other end of the spectrum; I felt, was such a bland character, while her only redeeming quality was the exchanges between her and the protagonist.
It also bothered me that the characters were all high school-aged; and it felt like it was done ""just because"" - it doesn't actually do anything for the plot other than make it less believable, they're never shown going to school. One of them even owns a cafe. Maybe it's a cultural thing, maybe in Japan people of that age are REALLY independent and do things like rent out a place as a pseudo-lab, give lectures to people with PhDs thrice their senior, wear their jacket halfway on, and open cafes. But for me, it just pulled me out of the story.
With that said the story was intriguing and clever at times. It definitely kept me watching until the end, although I felt the series lasted two episodes too long, I was still okay with the final conclusion; it wasn't bad by any means, nor was the series. It was good, but it could've been great.",8

                I HAVE SEEN SO MANY ANIMES OVER MANY YEARS NOW AND I THOUGH THAT THERE COULD NOT BE ANY THING NEW FOR ME, BUT I WAS WRONG.. boy this show is epic.
i dropped this show 2 times because the first 4 episodes were just a pain in the ass, but when you get to episode 10+ it get exponentially better with every episode. at episode 20+ i was dying with excitement.
Don't judge this anime but the first few episodes!!!

A very interesting and amazing anime.
It's all about time travel, parallel universes and changing the past to change the future.
If you're into stuff that require a bit thinking and guessing what will happen, this is the anime for you. The events in the series are strongly linked with time so it's best to keep an eye out when they show you the date that event took place. It would help in understanding and enjoying the anime more.
The characters are well designed and the story is really great. As well as a bit of romance.
Do watch it. It's awesome with a great
                  ending.",9
"
                This was the first anime I watched based on MyAnimeList's recommendation. I hadn't heard of it before, and I love me a time travel story, and the reviews here really sold it.
Verdict? It's good, but not worth the hype. The thing I heard most often praised was the character development. To me, the characters are fun to watch interact, most of them are given a decent amount of backstory and/or frontstory (it's about time travel after all), but they're still all very flat. They are not nuanced or full of different facets. They do not behave in ways that seem out of character (with the
                  arguable exception of the protagonist).  Like I said, they're entertaining to watch, but well developed? Maybe in comparison to lots of other animes (I shudder to think), but not even in the same league as many others. I can think of at least 10 that do a better job on characters in a shorter run time.
The story is the area where Steins;Gate shines the most. Lots of intrigue and mystery around the events happening without ever getting too convoluted or hard to understand. Cool plot twists and questionable scientific statements. I don't want to spoil anything, but I'll say that the story kept me hooked and wondering what would happen next, even when it ventured into pretty ridiculous territory.
 Anyway, I'm not trying to criticize this anime much, it's perfectly fine for what it is. I just think I had it slightly misadvertised to me. Still, certainly worth watching, maybe you'll be gushing its praises afterwards. But I'm not.",7
"
                Steins;Gate is a SciFi roller coaster of ""holy crap"" and heart wrenching moments. It will raise hopes and break hearts within a split second of each other. 
Based on the title, some will realize that Steins;Gate takes place in the same universe as Chaos;Head. Most people remember Chaos;Head being a terrible show and have understandable fears for what they might do with SG. 
The first episode is arguably the weakest. Most drops I know of have come after the extremely confusing premier. However, in relation to the entire show the first episode was very well thought out. Bear in mind that other great shows have
                  had weak starts too like TTGL and Code Geass. 
The story is complex. So much so that explaining it and keeping this relatively spoiler free would be extremely difficult. But the general set up is self proclaimed mad scientist, Okabe, has discovered that he can send texts back in time and that he's the only one who realizes the changes. Him and his friends are then thrust (unknowingly) into the early stages of the time machine race. 
As the story progresses we learn more about Okabe, his friends, and what they all do in the future. As he progresses with his new found power, he discovers that some things are better left unchanged, and others are worth risking everything to alter. 
As wonderful as the story is, the true strength of the show are the characters. Each one brings a unique personality to the table. As the story progresses, even the most trivial of characters begin to have major implications. The cast has everything and everyone is important in some way or the other. Each character gets significant development which relates to the story. 
While I don't really tend to care about this, I have to mention how well acted the show is. Especially Okabe. There is a scene late into the show where he gives one of his patented speeches where he breaks down crying. If you didn't know you were watching something special before, you do at that moment. 
Steins;Gate, while it was slow out of the gate, picked up speed and never looked back. A charming cast, great story, and one of the greatest emotional rollercoasters since Clannad. SG is a true timeless masterpiece.",10

                *Spoilers ahead*
Pathetic. 
Alright, so I usually don't feel the need to write a review, but seeing how many positive ones this anime has gotten, I feel the need to. 
Don't be fooled by the high ranking, this is not a good anime. It's so bad, I feel like ranting about an anime for the first time.
Let's do this properly. Music: nothing. There's nothing. Nothing memorable, that is. 
Art: the only character with actual features is Okabe, everyone else apparently wasn't worth a proper design. 
Story: unevenly paced. Stiff, repetitive dialogue. Considerable amount of plot holes as well as irrelevant arcs and stories. Slow build-up to a less-than-memorable and even less believable ending. In the end, everything just feels pointless. 
*Major Spoiler* And even worse, a story supposedly about time-traveling and an organization set on world-domination degenerates into sappy, hardly-believable romance. Pretty much like a version of SAO but without the cool CG. 
Voice acting: I saw it dubbed, but I'd say it's pretty good. So, one point total. 
Characters: Now here's what makes this anime completely unwatchable. You get one good character: Okabe, and that's it. And at some points even he seems to be built on nothing more than quirks, many of which get old and stop being funny. As for the female characters... I don't know how to put it in polite words. Just awful. Horrible. The writer must think women have no brains. Even the lead, who's a physicist, throws tantrums like a little girl. 
A character actually transforms into a girl and immediately becomes clumsy. WTF?
World of advice: Don't be lured in by the small original things that appear in the first few episodes: the mad scientist who talks to his phone, the tv screen frozen on a lama, the disintegrating bananas... because that's as good as it gets. Ep 1 is the best one, and it's still pretty pitiable.",1
"
                I dropped Steins;Gate at first. I personally found it too tedious and that the pace was going too slow for my liking. But after telling my friend this, they hassled me every day, blowing up my phone telling me: ""Finish the show! You dropped it EXACTLY one episode before the good stuff happens!"".
So I reluctantly decided to finish the show. I'm so glad that my friend made me finish the series because it was definitely worth it. The pacing immediately kick started and I was drawn into the show, clicking next after every episode- not noticing my surrounding, totally enveloped in the dramatic events occurring
                  in front of me.The show touched based with me, what if I could go back in time to fix a mistake? That's what Okabe (the MC) does. Seeing the effects of one action affect others and the future is my weak spot. I love time travel related shows and Steins;Gate did more than please me with their well-rounded and lovable characters, eye pleasing art, and more than satisfying plot.",9
"
                Time always moves continually forward, except in fiction, wherein if the writers decide to implement time travel they can do whatever they like, and they can do interesting things with the narrative on account of this fact. All that Steins;Gate does, however, is just freeze time in place, most stories might have time move in a linear fashion, but Steins;Gate is about as static and unmoving as they come.
The story itself, self-proclaimed ‚Äòmad scientist‚Äô Hououin Kyouma is in possession of a ‚Äòphone microwave‚Äô, don‚Äôt know where it came from or how it works, but he finds out that through using it he can send text
                  messages into the past, and an individual by the name of John Titor once told him on an unspecified image board that an evil organisation called SERN is going to in the future use time travel to do bad stuff. I will say one thing, and that is that Kyouma is the one redeeming factor of Steins;Gate, I don‚Äôt like to play the role of armchair diagnostician, especially not with fictional characters, but between his random outbursts of Engrish, insistence that anything going wrong is an attack by ‚Äòthe Organisation‚Äô, and routinely pretending to call somebody on the phone, he‚Äôs probably a schizoaffective or some shit, and he‚Äôs an interesting character, not quite enough to carry the show, but a cut above everyone else, and I can describe everyone else with just a few words ‚Äì moe girl, mute girl but not actually, badly written tsundere, otoko no ko, pervert otaku hacker. None of them have any positive qualities, and I felt like the humour detracted quite a bit from my enjoyment of the show, their style of humour being double entendres at every single point they could with the philosophy being ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have to worry about comedic timing if we just keep making the same jokes every 10 minutes.‚Äù
Let‚Äôs think about mad scientists for a bit. Doctors Frankenstein, Herbert West, Brown, Wily. I would characterise these individuals as having two core qualities, incompetence, and ambition. Kyouma‚Äôs definitely got the incompetence, no doubt about that, he doesn‚Äôt know shit, but fair enough on him, there aren‚Äôt any good scientists who‚Äôve proven the existence of time travel and how to utilise it, so he gets a pass on that one, but he hasn‚Äôt got any ambition to speak of, he‚Äôs got undeniable delusions of grandeur and claims he wants to rule the world one day, but has no idea how to do that. After about episode 5 when it‚Äôs settled that the Phone Microwave can in fact send messages into the past, nothing really happens, since sending emails causes a divergence in how the past happened, butterfly effect and shit, so everyone‚Äôs memories become slightly distorted, and it‚Äôs just a one trick pony. The content of basically every episode is ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to try and send something back into the past with the various tools we are required to use in order to do so oh no something is not how it was previously‚Äù. It stops being a revelation when it happens so often, and the show itself even acknowledges the fact that though sending a text message into the past can completely alter everything, to the extent that apparently one text can completely remove any traces of otaku culture from Akihabara, for some reason, the interpersonal relationships of the main cast never changes. How‚Äôs that work? Either the butterfly effect exists or it doesn‚Äôt, and speaking of these in characters, my patience was running dry by about episode 9, and once they started introducing random monologue flashbacks about details I never asked about, never cared about, and didn‚Äôt even make any difference to the story or my understanding of the characters, I was less than impressed. Also, remember the badly written tsundere? Being locked in a dark room with Kyouma for a couple minutes, in the presence of others, compelled her to give a quasi-confession of her feelings, they can‚Äôt even fucking keep her character consistent.
Really, there‚Äôs nothing of value here, Steins;Gate is just a slice of life anime with an above average protagonist, but the rest of the cast is generic anime lass with one quirk at best, and an absolute pain at worst. It is a slice of life, it has the facade of being a sci-fi or something, but what are the consequences of the presence of time travel in this story? How do they move the plot along? They don‚Äôt, nothing comes of it. If Steins;Gate is a sci-fi, then Robocop is a medical drama.",4

                Warning- SPOILERS.
Coming into this show, I thought it would be a masterpiece. I was hyped to experience what is apparently one of the highest rated shows of all time on MyAnimeList.net. But this shit is just garbage.
But what I watched, was absolutely nothing like any of the other top anime I've seen. It didn't have the animation production value, it didn't have a full cast of multifaceted characters, it didn't have a satisfying plot, and despite the brief 24 episode length, I found it to be extremely repetitive and constantly having to recycle old ideas.
This show is so different from a genuinely impresive anime that
                  it's extremely confusing to me how anyone could watch this and think ""This is one of the best shows ever."" 
For starters, let's examine the characters.
--Rintarou Okabe. Guy. Pretentious unemployed guy who thinks he's a mad scientist despite not having any real skills. Regular schizo.
--Kurisu Makise. Girl. American scientific genius who falls in love with Okabe.
--Mayuri Shiina. Girl. Okabe's childhood friend who has no other reason to exist than to fawn over Okabe.
--Itaru ""Daru"" Hashida. Guy. Okabe's roommate who has insane hacking ability but only uses that to assist his unemployed roommate Okabe.
--Luka Urushibara. Girl (or is she?). Neighborhood friend of Okabe's. Transgender. Falls in love with Okabe.
--Faris NyanNyan. Girl. Runs a Catgirl Cafe. Rich spoiled girl. Develops a thing for Okabe.
--Barely any others.
Are you seeing a pattern here? This is anything but a fully developed universe. The template they are working with is not a full fledged world like Naruto, or Fullmetal Alchemist, or even Sword Art Online. This is just a harem anime, existing to soothe the egos and stimulate the passions of lonely teenage boys. And I don't necessarily have a problem with harem anime in itself, I just don't like when it pretends to be meaningful, and pretends to actually be able to grapple with deep subjects, when it's a transparently masturbatory fantasy. 
The fact that everyone in this world only exists for the benefit of the main character and that all the women magically end up infatuated with him, despite him being an unemplolyed schizophrenic, is not beneficial to the story. It is immersion breaking.
The majority of the hype seems to be about the time travel element. And I can understand this being appealing to people. But when I compare this story to every other time travel story I have ever come across- such as the time turner from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, or Back to the Future, or Groundhog Day, or Looper, Steins;Gate has by far the least interesting, least impactful, and least appealing version of time travel.
Basically, the authors of the story decided that just because you have the ability to travel back in time, doesn't mean you have the ability to change fate. So the main character, Okabe, goes back in time over and over, trying to change something, only to find that he cannot do so. 
Furthermore, there is a strange ""life for a life"" thing going on-- when the main character saves one life, fate steps in and takes another life of a person close to him. 
Now the main character, despite having the ability to teleport back in his timeline, feels completely helpless. Pretty crazy, right? Not exactly what you would expect from a show about traveling back in time, which you would expect allows you to change anything. 
Furthermore, every change the main character makes in the timeline, costs his friend a day of life. Please pause for a moment and consider how insane these rules are. Where did this come from? What mechanism is ensuring that an extra person dies to compensate for the life that was saved? Is there some kind of deity watching over this universe, saying ""oh look, we're one death short"" and then just killing someone to make up for that? Basically yes.
Traditional time travel stories open up Pandora's Box and allow the characters to go back and genuinely change anything. But Steins;Gate says ""You can go back, but the Hand of God will prevent you from doing anything important. You can only use time travel to do things that don't make any difference."" This is just astronomical levels of stupid. It turns time travel from a fascinating tool into window dressing.
So these are the mechanics of time travel in the show. What do they do with it? Simple. They make the main character deal with this handicapped version of time travel over and over, banging his head against the wall, failing to use his time travel ability to create ANY lasting positive change for 24 episodes, milking his suffering for emotions and drama. 
Then at the very end, they relax this handicap, and allow him to make just ONE lasting and positive change, at the exact moment needed to create a happy ending. So convenient. This is incredibly lazy and stupid storytelling and I'm astounded that more people aren't seeing through it.
It is hard to overstate just how much the ""Fate"" element in itself separates Steins;Gate from other time travel stories. The set of possibilities that are opened up by time travel are tantalizing. But in a bait and switch, it is revealed that none of the things that time travel lets you do normally, like win the lottery, are even remotely possible in this story. Lame!
If anything, time travel in this universe allowed the writers to put in LESS work than in a traditional linear story, because every character except the main character cannot see the plot unfolding as he hope between universes. So they don't go through character development. The writers don't need to think about how they react to different events. It's like they're continuously going through amnesia. They remain exactly the same from beginning to end. The writers barely had to do anything! Genius!
I don't really find anything in this show impressive at all. The main character is a pretentious douchebag who lords his intellect over his friends, and who remains condescending and douchey to his friends all the way to the very end of the show. There are more plot holes than you can count. I kept waiting for something clever to happen, but it never did. This show was a complete waste of time. By far the dumbest and worst time travel content I have ever come across. I would give it a zero if I could.",1

Okabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)
(Got this idea from Furbylicious) Thanks man. :D
*This contains plots and spoilers.*
I think Stains;Gate is a lovely anime and I really enjoyed it because of the characters, the voice acting and the story. The characters are amazing and the voice acting is terrific, but the plot is uninspiring. I know, this sounds like I‚Äôm a hater but I love this anime, love it a lot. Do not think I am hating on the anime because it is overrated, I don‚Äôt think of that one bit.
Story - 8:
As I said the plot is not
                  inspiring, it is kind of seems a little bit‚Ä¶ how do you say it? It‚Äôs not interesting when you think about it. Well to me the story seems uninteresting and clich√© at first impressions but you think about it you will feel there is more to it and eventually gets significantly more interesting. The big problem about the anime is Okabe, the reason I say this because they don‚Äôt talk about him that much, they should have mention his childhood, where he was born and how he was raise and also his parents what happened to them, they don‚Äôt really talk about that. But does that make it a bad anime? Hell no! So none of you come f*cking giving me wrong facts about the anime. Anyway, there is a guy called Rintarou Okabe he is a portrayed to be a mad scientist, well no shit and that‚Äôs what a love about him. He‚Äôs goal is to make a Future Gadget Research Laboratory and travel in time. Okabe is eighteen years-old and he is friends with a fat kid Hishida and his childhood friend Shiina, also a love interest Makise.
Characters ‚Äì 9: 	
Okabe: His one of my favourite characters in the anime because he is smart, funny and his acts like a evil genius, also I think his voice actor is amazing. His talks as if he is the commander and he does an evil laugh to act like a crazy scientist, also he hates being wrong and loves to argue with people. I love the way he speaks, like a jester in those circus. I wish they talked more about him, you know. :(
Makise: I think she is a great character and she is a love interest for Okabe, to be honest I think they are perfect for each other. Well‚Ä¶ Makise and 
Okabe act like married couples when they are arguing a lot of times, which they eventually fall in love with each other. (That‚Äôs how they all are.) Also she is my favourite character too.
Shiina: I think she is cute because she has a voice of an innocent person and she is like one of those people who comfort them when they are stress, frustrated or depressed. She is Okabe‚Äôs childhood friend. 
Hashida: Well he is smart and brilliant hacker.
Art/Sound ‚Äì 8:
Art and sound is great the characters look beautiful and the voice acting is amazing. It is not like those voices that the person is just looking the paper and just saying words. The voice acting sounds like the characters have emotion. Art the characters look amazingly drawn and the backgrounds look amazing.
Enjoyment ‚Äì 9:
I really loved this anime and Okabe makes it enjoyable and fun to watch. I love the way he acts, all crazy like. I love the characters in the anime; to me I think they are all lovable. It will feel boring at first but when you reach the third episode it will get better and more exciting. Do not think I hate the anime okay.
Overall ‚Äì 9:
I give a 9 because it is a fantastic anime even though the plot is not that inspiring. I never give any anime a ten out of ten because no anime in my opinion is perfect. Also please give your comments on this review ok. :)",9
"
                Throughout the beginning of the anime, I didn't really have the feel to finish it through, so I dropped it for a while. Then seeing that anime title again after a year, I decided to watch it all the way through. Seeing that I did not finish it, I regret not finishing it earlier. This anime had the best, if not, one of the best plot I've ever seen.
Story: 10/10- The story kinda screws with you, but you will figure it out once you watch more of it and figure out what really happens when the anime reveals, TIME MACHINE. Since the anime is a
                  sci-fi anime, it is rather enjoyable, even if sci-fi is not your go to genre.
Art: 10/10- The art of this anime was magnificent for a 2011 anime? Yes it completely dominated all of the other anime, in the art categories. While I've seen all the shounen animes, this takes the cake. While most shounens were longer types of anime, the illustrators seems to take the time to perfect the art style and make this anime extraordinarily beautiful.
Sound: 10/10- Not much to say about the sound, but I voice actors, all the sci-fi sounds in the background. Everything just seems to fit with this anime. 
Character: 10/10- The character development was truly one of the best character development I have seen in my whole life, of watching anime. Okabe, starting off really weird, ended up being very interesting to watch. The many paths he takes and many different psychological experiences throughout the anime made me think again about Okabe. Makise was my favorite character in this anime(as of most people would agree). She is everything would want in a person, that fits perfectly in this anime. Genius at the age of 18? Beautiful and with a rather cute personality we all love. She just turns out to be a very huge part in Okabe's projects and starts to cooperation with him, with more ease than before as seen in the earlier episode. As of the rest of the characters they all were great, Mayuri was the light hearted girl that kept our hopes up with her very cute little girl personality, and The Hacker, was one that kept out nerdy side in the anime going.  Characters in this anime, at top notch ;D.
Enjoyment: 10/10- Everything I said above explains most of it. Edge of my seat at some parts and getting emotional at some parts. LOVE IT, what is not to enjoy about the plot twisting sc-fi anime? Nothing, WATCH IT NOW!
Overall:10/10- From not finishing it to finishing it is the best decision I've made in my whole anime watching life.",10

                First of all this is my first review so please be gently with everyone.. :)
Did you ever regret doing something??What if taking that back would lead to someone unhappiness will you still do it??
And would you defy Destiny this if your given a chance??
Story: 10
One of the selling point of Steins gate is story the first half of the steins would seem to you slow and some might stop watching half way through but it pick up the pace later on in the  2nd half. thats when the mystery, Thriller  and struggle of  the protagonist start ..the twist of the story is
                  just mind blowing and will leave you the edge of your seat...and im very great full that i watch one of the best anime every created. :D
Sound:8
 The sound really complement the scene of the story and i like it..
Characters:10
One of the reason i give the steins a 10. :D
The interaction between the characters in one hell of enjoyment for me specially between the protagonist and the main heroin... they are like cat and mouse...the interaction and character development of the main character is amazing for me...and some that you thought would be some kind of mascot in story is in fact will play a great role in the protagonist main character develop, all the characters play an important role in the story and a good entertainment for all the view..^_^
Enjoyment And Overall:10
This is one of the best Anime that i ever watch i kept me in the edge of my seat heck the moment the story pick up the pace it leave me a feeling that if  im in the protagonist situation i would likely lost my mind....and if you want to know what is that better watch this now folks :D...
i like to say more but can really put some much it to word what i fell about when i finish this amazing anime because i really lack in the comprehensions department..i did my best in my very first review hope you its useful guys :DD",10

                Way overrated. First thing to note is those first ten episodes are painfully boring. It does pick up after that but will semi regret the precious time you wasted on the first ten.

                I thoroughly enjoyed Stein's Gate. The characters were endearing, the story was unique, and it was overall enjoyable to watch. It is one of those animes that is good to look back on in retrospect and ponder; it keeps you thinking about it after you've finished watching it.
The first episodes of the anime are expository. Most of the first half is set-up for the second half, but once you get past those, Stein's Gate really takes off. The story quickens pace and it redeems its sometimes boring first half.
Stein's Gate is completely worth the watch. It is a fresh take on a redundant concept and
                  an intriguing story.",9
"
                I am a bit mixed on why it has such a high rating. It was a sci fi anime and it was highly rated on MAL and those were the only two reasons why I decide to watch it because otherwise It didn't really grab my attention.
The start is a bit confusing even me I felt like dropping it after the first episode because I didn't what was going on so you have to be a bit patient. With half of the season being really slow though things start coming together really quickly and the pace starts picking up fast but in some cases there
                  are some halts in between. The light comedy adds a layer to the tone of the story though the tone can be slightly off at times. And there are some harem elements which I have no interest in the beginning of the series.
The sound effects really add a extra layer of realism and immersion to the world. Though there is barely any music in any of the scenes but when there is music its great. The directing is amazing thing really captivates the scenes. The visuals are pretty good though there are some uses of CG here and there and most scenes take in the same place.
The characters are quiet stereotypical and shallow there isn't particularly unique about them and nothing bad about them either. But they get some development as times goes on.
I understand the high rating. No sci fi anime was ever well thought of and grounded as Stein's Gate which has a lot of creditability to real life scientific theories. But on the other note, the amount of plot holes and flaws it had just made it all fall into the mud. To top it off even with it's flaws I was still surprisingly hooked and managed to finish it quiet quickly.",6
"
                Let me begin this review by cutting to the chase: Steins;Gate is a watchable anime, but it is by no means the masterpiece that so many hail it to be. Why do I say this? Read on to find out.
My first problem with Steins;Gate is that it is full of plot holes. Time travel stories often are, but this particular one tries too hard to be clever. Unfortunately, every attempt it makes to fold disparate temporal events together or explain the nature of time travel introduces a new weakness into the story, and before long any viewer keeping track of things realises that there is
                  no internal consistency to be had anywhere. Logic? Do not expect it.
Next, the attempts by the writers to bring in scientific concepts are painful to witness. While we do not usually need the science part of (soft) science fiction to be perfectly accurate, the importance of these concepts to the story put the spotlight squarely on them. Because of this, it is extremely difficult for those of us with even the most basic knowledge of neuroscience or physics to take the technical aspects of the story at all seriously. If you're tempted to argue that this is fiction and therefore protected by literary licence, I would simply shrug and say, ""The pseudoscience is strong with this one."" This is really not SF but fantasy with an SF veneer. I like my fantasy just fine, but when the authors insist on tagging on so much nonsense science, all the wincing I keep doing distracts me from the show.
Thirdly, the characters are surprisingly uncharismatic. I say surprisingly because many of them have unique looks and personalities, and the voice actors do a good job with them furthermore. They are certainly unforgettable. However, despite all that, it is quite impossible to really care for any of them. Additionally, it is difficult to take Makise and Okabe for the geniuses they are supposed to be - neither comes across as particularly intelligent.
Fourthly, the relationships portrayed here are *meant* to be deep and emotionally powerful, but they really don't feel that way at all. It does not help that the banter between the characters is invariably flat and unamusing. This is not a terribly witty or funny anime.
The show is not all bad, however. The art is very nice and production values are high. While this does not rank as a top 10 or even top 50 anime in my book, it is still a decently enjoyable series. It's definitely something one could watch when there's nothing better to catch up on right at the moment.

SPOILER ALERT
Here are some of the many plot holes, inconsistencies, and unintended conflicts in Steins;Gate. Please do not read further unless you've already watched the show or do not plan to watch it. If you read further but have trouble distinguishing reductio ad absurdum from equivocation, please do not write me to disagree with me because you will just look foolish; if you must write me, please at least take an undergraduate course in formal logic first. A grounding in physics and neuroscience would also be a plus. Yea, I'm a big, mean, arrogant SOB with too much education and too little patience for fools. You have been warned.
1) There are multiple coexisting world lines and the time machines are actually nothing of the sort - they are instead devices that send data (in several different formats) from one reality to another. Therefore, whatever the characters do or do not do, nothing actually changes in their original reality - all they do is cross over to a different reality or create a new reality.
> 1a) The old reality still exists. The show is therefore not about changing the future but escapism.
>> 1ai) If the original traveller actually remains in his reality, then this original self actually does not experience any change in reality. This means that from the POV of the person ""left"" in a timeline, the time machine does absolutely nothing.
>>> (1ai1) This effectively means that the time machine actually *really* does nothing - there is merely a branch of existence in which that version of the person experiences different things. I.e., time travellers are actually just delusional.
>>> (1ai2) In the best case (if one can call it that), the ‚Äútime machine‚Äù creates a whole new timeline to accommodate the new scenario. This is still an escapism problem.
> 1b) Or the old reality is destroyed. Great, because this means an entire universe of living things gets wiped from existence every time some idiot does a jump.
> 1c) The old reality still exists except that the jumper now no longer exists in this world. But whomever they are trying to save is still dead. Refer to escapism problem.
2) If (1) is true, then when a traveller from timeline T1 moves to timeline T2, he effectively wipes out the alternate version of himself from existence, taking over that body and deleting the original awareness.
> 2a) Again, we have a cold-blooded murder. If you think it's ok to do that to yourself, my question to you is this: if an alternate reality version of you wants to take over your existence because your world is better than his, would you think that's perfectly acceptable?
> 2b) If this traveller than jumps again, whether back to T1 or over to T3, what happens to the taken-over T2 identity? The possibilities are:
>> 2bi) The ""deleted"" person returns abruptly. We now have the following problems:
>>> (2bi1) Where was this person during the time he was displaced?
>>> (2bi2) What agency decides how to splice versions of the person in and out?
>>> (2bi3) If the T1 traveller had not moved on from the T2 world, the T2 version of him would presumably have remained in his data limbo = consigned to hell for all eternity?
>> 2bii) The deleted person no longer exists. (Assuming that this reality isn't just completely wiped from existence.) In this case, there are two possibilities:
>>> (2bii1) This person was not meant to exist anymore in this timeline to ""begin with"". This version of events suggests that nobody is actually doing anything - that everything is exactly as it should be, and people in some timelines are essentially suffering delusions that they are time travellers.
>>> (2bii2) The jump has changed this timeline. Every jump is a murder.
>> 2biii) A ""copy"" is made and there is now a T1 version of the traveller in the T2 timeline as well as in the 2nd jump's destination timeline. So a version of the traveller still suffers. The questions to ask here are firstly which version is the one who suffers - the original or the copy? And secondly isn't every jump actually creating more misery by trapping a copy of the suffering fool in yet another reality?
3) Now, let‚Äôs discard (1) and consequently (2) and consider the possibility that there is only one reality and the alternate timelines are basically ‚Äúunrealised probabilities‚Äù. In this case, the future is strictly determined by the past, and it becomes impossible for non-time-travellers to ‚Äúhave lived through‚Äù other lives before.
> 3a) This means that the majority of the d√©j√† vu plot makes zero sense.
> 3b) Unless we take it that each time a jump occurs, the other experienced timelines become more real.
>> 3bi) But we have already established that there is only one reality, so this does not make sense either.
4) Let‚Äôs try a different scenario: there are multiple realities, but time travel only affects the ‚Äúcondensation of probabilities‚Äù rather than shift one into an alternate reality.
> 4a) The d√©j√† vu plot still fails completely.
> 4b) Unless we take it that when a jump occurs, the current reality is twisted to become more like another existing reality, and that people can then perceive these similar realities even when this reality is later changed to be unlike them.
>> 4bi) If you‚Äôre tempted to say ‚Äúresonance‚Äù here, I suggest you go back to middle school and learn physics from scratch.
5) Then there‚Äôs the problem of how a person who ‚Äúno longer ever existed‚Äù could have done anything in this world. You can‚Äôt drop a bottle when you were never there to hold it in the first place. You can‚Äôt buy something for someone or tell someone something if you had never existed.
> 5a) So perhaps its only memories of that person that disappear?
>> 5ai) Firstly, why would that be the case? For the uninitiated, memory most categorically does not work that way.
>> 5aii) But the person actually disappears from this existence as well.
> 5b) Where does he go? To a convenient pocket dimension where only he exists? To some other dimension where he murders his other self?
I could do this the whole day.",6

                Time is an interesting thing. Many of us constantly think about turning it back for a re-do or to re-live a beautiful moment; it‚Äôs only natural. We wish to change what we have no power over and it forces us to contemplate the meaning and finality of the world. However, it‚Äôs the way things happen but once that makes them special. This is an important topic in the series and what make time travel so fascinating to me. I must say, Steins;gate has some of the best theories of time travel in any medium; it's comprehensive and very well thought-out, and the reason it my
                  single favorite anime. I am a time travel nut, and I love deep thoughts and intricate theories and this show really drew me in in a way that I hadn't experienced. Of course I don't mind a good love story in there, or a battle for everlasting friendship. Oh, or the discovery of an intricate and mysterious plot. I think you understand now, right? Awesome, see you in 24 episodes. 10.5/10
I hope you liked my very first short review! I know this isn't ""Typical"" but I had fun writing it. Feel free to give me feedback on my writing.I'm trying to write my feelings in a concise way that conveys the meaning of the show, and is fun-ish to read. Thanks for your consideration :D",10
"
                Steins;Gate is an excellent example of how to make an anime. There is so much good that pointing out the mistakes is actually hard. I'll try to be as unbiased as possible, even if it might be difficult.
You might like this anime if:
-You love great stories.
-You want memorable characters.
-You like sci-fi and time travel or thriller anime.
-You're looking for a show with good comedy.
-You're looking for something deep and thought provoking.
You might dislike this anime if:-You hate slow pacing.
-You are not into sci-fi or time travel. There's a lot of it here.
Story: 9
The story is brilliant. If you read the synopsis you get a pretty good gist of it. The only reason this is not a 10, is because after rewatching it with someone, I realised how slow it starts. I had to hype them up often, because they were getting bored, as they are not huge sci-fi anime fans. You need a couple of episodes to get into the juicy stuff. When it gets going homever, it just doesn't stop. Twists and turns around every corner, multiple hints, even if some of them might be a little bit too obvious, and multiple throw offs. The story keeps you at the edge of your seat and before you realise it you are there in front of the computer screen at 3 AM after marathoning the show, tired as hell but satisfied just as much. It could be compared to a roller coaster ride You get onto it, slowly make your way up to the top, and when you finally start going fast it's super fun and you don't even realize when it's all over. That about describes my experience with it. The comedy is also pure gold. It can be smart when it wants to, or stupid when it needs to.  Oh, and the ending is almost perfect. You just have to add the special episode.
Art and Animation: 9
For a show without a huge budget it looks great! Stays true to the core material (the visual novel under the same name), but at the same time it's more clean. Well, of course it had to be a little different. If you have seen the game's art style, you know it's just impossible to transfer it into the anime perfectly. They did a really good job though! It looks realistic and complements the show really well. The animation is fluid, and some of the show's scenes are literally made to create memes. I just wanted to mention that, because Steins;Gate memes are best memes. Sorry about that. So overall for what it is it's great. I can't complain.
Sound: 8
After listening to the OST recently I got to say I was pleasantly surprised. During the show the music is probably a bit forgettable, because your attention is set more on everything else, but it's quite good. It does it's job well. The opening, on the other hand, is great though.
Also I usually don't mention the voice acting, as I watch anime with subtitles, but I got to acknowledge the greatness here. The voices perfectly fit the characters.
Characters: 10
This anime has probably the most memorable cast I've ever seen. Almost everyone has great development. And I can't even begin to explain how hard it is to achieve this greatness in a time travel story. Each character is brilliantly written, has their own memorable moments and overall I just couldn't get enough of them. This is as close to a perfect cast as you'll probably ever get.
Enjoyment: 9
I really enjoyed Steins;Gate. At first I wasn't sold, as it started slowly, but as the anime progressed I found myself drawn deep into the story, fell in love with the cast of great characters and in the end I was just craving for more. You'll most likely end up thinking the same way I do and maybe, just maybe you'll enjoy it even more than I did.
Overall: 9
It has it's flaws, but damn if it isn't great. The more anime I watch, the more fondly I look  on this one. It truly is a feat to aim for by any other show. To this day it stays as one of the best anime out there. I completely agree with it's place on the top anime list. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a higher score are personal preferences, but I can't reccomend it enough. It's a must watch for any anime fan out there.",9
"
                Steins;Gate is an anime that changed my view of the whole anime industry. If you prefer a good story over a mainstream painty shot anime then you could watch Steins;Gate :). 
Spoiler ~
The plot has weird start. You will just get confused while watching  episode 1 and you still don't know what the ""EL PSY CONGROO""  is happening xD. Time machine? Who's this weird MC? What's that object in the roof? That laugh tho xD... Why is there a dead body in a pool of blood.... Where are those people after the MC send that message? 
The plottwist is quite long but I
                  think it's fine. See it like a present you've been waiting for cause it will get intense. And I know some have no patience at all and they think it's bad because it took so long. Good stories take time ;). You must be a weeaboo if you don't have any patience or if you think it's hard for you too watch Because too much info,  you also have got a pause button. 
 The first part of the story was kinda happy and fun to fool people, it can go wrong any time.",10
"
                After having watched Steins;Gate two times and many other great anime, it's fair to say that I can give an honest opinion about the story and about the anime in its entirety. Death Note was my first anime and in the following weeks I had watched Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood and Code Geass. This review will be based on my honest opinion and if you think I'm being biased or subjective then please let me know. 
**Might contain spoilers**
Story - 9/10 
I really enjoyed the story from the beginning till the end. I do agree the first 6 episodes are relatively slow-paced, I would even
                  go as far as saying until a certain event happens a few episodes later (people who have finished the show will know what I mean) it still is slow-paced. Does the pace have influence on the story in general? In my opinion it doesn't but that's for the viewer to decide. From that certain event until the very end of the anime it only gets better and better every episode. The first episodes served as character development and setting up the plot. I enjoyed every episode from start to finish, but there's one thing I don't quite agree with. The story continues after that certain event and the MC tries everything in his power to prevent this event from happening. Later he finds out that if he prevents that event from happening, another event will happen. This means the MC has to choose between the events. (Spoiler alert) In the end the MC manages to prevent both events from happening, but it is never explained how this affects the future. I'm glad the MC could prevent both events from happening, but the ending is incomplete in my opinion. The OVA episode also didn't cover this subject, so this and the slow-pace issues are the reasons I can't give the story a 10/10.
Sound - 10/10
Never have I been so amazed by a soundtrack. ''Believe me'' and ''Promise'' are absolutely mind-blowing soundtracks. Even the Steins;Gate main soundtrack is amazing. I have nothing else to say about the sound.
Characters 9/10
The MC Okabe Rintarou is a complex and well thought character. He puts up this fa√ßade that he has no interest in socializing and the well-being of others, but he contradicts himself every episode. His character is funny, well-written, caring, friendly and loyal to the bone. 
The other MC Makise Kurisu is a typical Tsundere and the show doesn't try to hide this. They even go as far as calling her a Tsundere in the show. (Spoiler alert) As you would expect she falls in love with the other MC and this wasn't a suprise at all. If you pay close attention to her every episode you can see that she's slowly developing feelings for the other MC. In the end you'll love her just as much as the other MC.
Shiina Mayuri is a typical sweet and innocent anime girl (which they will use against you). Her character isn't really anything special compared to the other MC, but she had a lot of potential. For instance you never get to know her true feelings towards the MC. Waste of potential in my opinion.
All the other important characters aren't really anything to shout about and definitely not worth reviewing (Suzuha and Moeka had much potential as well). 
Art - 9/10
I enjoyed the art-style of this anyme, but it wasn't anything special in my opinion. I prefer a more realistic art-style like Death Note or Darling in the Franxxx (not a good example). 
Enjoyment - 10/10
This is by far one of the most enjoyable anime I have ever seen. The characters are likeable, the sound is amazing, the story keeps getting better every episode and I actually have sympathy for all the characters.   
Overall - 10/10
I don't like giving something a 10 unless it actually deserves it and this anime definitely deserves all the praise. It is one of the best anime I have ever seen and I doubt another show will make me feel like Steins;Gate did. I recommend this anime to people who don't mind a slow start. If you like drama/slice of life anime then look no further. If you enjoyed Erased/Re:Zero then this anime is a must-watch for you.",10
"
                I wanted to write this review for people like my brother who are questioning whether or not they should finish it and to tell them yes, you should finish it. This was one of the first anime series I actually finished, so please bear with me because it's been a while. I had never heard nor read anything about it prior, so personally I think that makes my opinion quite credible. Putting that aside, I'll organize this review systematically according to the ratings I'm giving.
Story: 9/10
My first impressions were that the story was very boring. Honestly the first half of the season barely held my
                  attention save the last couple minutes of each episode. Without giving away any specific spoilers, the plot takes on the path of a factorial function as x increases about mid-way through the season, and from then on I realized that this story is genius. Even the boring bit becomes interesting. I write that with complete sincerity so read carefully: the boring bit BECOMES interesting.
I held back 1 point from my rating solely because I felt bored for half the season. But the boredom was necessary to appreciate the plot to the fullest so please don't take my 9 too seriously.
Art: 9/10
I do like the art of Steins Gate a lot. They did an excellent job illustrating a scorching hot summer in a Japanese suburb. Watching them run around outside even in the shade was enough to nearly make me gasp in the heat myself. I appreciate that the characters are somewhat humanoid in proportions and the art style was quite attractive for the year it was created. I did enjoy Okabe's stubble in particular. I only gave it a 9 and not a 10 because it was not really ground-breaking and didn't come off as incredibly unique to me. It was just very good.
Sound: 9/10
The theme songs were good and very appropriate to the themes of the show. The voice actors in anime always impress me a lot and I particularly enjoyed Mayuri's voice actress who I, after watching her performance in other anime's, personally think is one of the best. But there weren't any moments that left a lasting impression on me because of the sound, which is why it lost marks with me.
Character: 10/10
Wow, where do I begin? I guess I'll start by apologizing for how poorly this section will be written partly because I don't want to spoil anything for you and partly because I can't put together words on how well the characters were designed in this show. Each character has an extra layer to them that will hurt your head and heart just thinking about it. You will find out the true meaning of Stein's Gate, El Psy Congroo, the reason behind the name Hououin Kyouma, why Mayuri seems like a dull pencil, how great Makisu Kurisu is, that Ruka is in fact a boy, Daru's secret love life and the past (and future) of the part-time soldier all wrapped together in a masterful plot that you will appreciate at the end of the series. You may not realize how incredible it is immediately but trust me, it is amazing how well they made the characters. Okabe in particular (personally).
Enjoyment: 10/10
I enjoyed this show for much longer than the time I used to watch it. I spent a good amount of time digesting the plot and each character's story. It was thought-provoking, emotionally moving and intricate enough to make it all more interesting than throwing non-sequitur sob-stories for the sake of imitating character depth like some of the other top anime's on this list (not going to put any names here solely because I don't want haters to discredit my review and not watch this show. Haters should watch too!). 
Overall: 10/10
My impression of this show was without a doubt a solid 10/10. The two or so weeks in Okabe's life were an amazing journey and the ending was so satisfying that I would want to experience it again and again in a time loop. Thank you for reading this to the end and I'm sorry if this review seems like I'm just complimenting an overhyped anime, but my main intention was to pick up the slackers who stopped half way and tell them to finish it, because it's worth it.",10
"
                This anime is great, let me just say  before hand. It had everything at a perfect amount, not too much of it to make you feel as though this was simply a drama with time travel as its side story. But not too little so you don't feel the emotional impact and power behind what this story is about. It adds everything and everything in the story compliments one another to aim for the story it was holding for. And this is why, Steins;Gate will always be one of my favorite shows.
This show has a science aspect to it, it tells you how, if
                  possible, time travel would be able to happen. But that's not all in this story, and that's what make it great. It teaches you the what if, the whys, the whens, it tells you much more than the main premise which is time travel. As an anime reviewer named GRArkada once said, it isn't just time travel, it's ABOUT time travel. Everything involving the elements, the emotional aspects involved, the cautions one should take, the feelings one would have, and everything. I'm tired as fuck so I'm repeating myself a lot so let me get to the point now. The main point.
Everything in steins;gate supported one another, as I said before, there was enough drama for the show to make sense, everything about the show complimented one another. It was a logical, thought provoking show, but at the same time it taught you the specific side of what would happen if we had ever invented time travel. 
I might edit this review later cus I realize I'm simply repeating myself and there's no need for that. But this show has had a great story, it's not about the what ifs its about the what would happen ifs. Ya, I'm definitely editing this later....",10
"
                The first three episodes set up an intriguing time travel premise, and are full of humour and charming banter between the characters.  Unfortunately, that is the high point of the show.  The characters don't develop after that.  Their relationships barely get off the ground, and by episode 6 their banter is stale.
If you want to know whether this show is worth your time, this is the important point:  As a time travel story, the plot is actually more boring than I could have imagined.  I was expecting a science fiction thriller, but this show is predominantly a slice-of-life drama. 
                  The time travel is more of a backdrop.
So my advice is to give the show a chance until episode 6 or so.  If it's boring to you by then, cut your losses because it doesn't get better.  All it has to offer are its characters, and if you don't love them by then, this is not the show for you.",4
"
                 Changing the past is something mankind wish for. Once, i thought of how exciting life would be with a time machine, never again would i hope for something that life changing. Steins; Gate , one of the most anticipated animation , remains one of the best among others. Does it deserve a perfect score ? My ratings are as below. 
STORY - 9
I wanted to give it an 8.5, but let's just go with 9. I could give it a 10, but something is holding me back. Steins; Gate started off very slowly. It's hard to understand anything on the first episode, and the
                  story takes a very slow turn , i almost giving up watching but until the 7/8 episode, it starts to get a little bit interesting. The real excitement starts from episode 12 and i couldn't stop watching after that. I got slightly relieved i didn't drop it. Others enjoy the half first episodes, but maybe the way the story goes on and the humour aren't my cup of tea. The 13-24 eps are really the ones that contribute the 9 score the most. Other than the criticism about the slow first half, the others are amazing.  
ART - 9
I usually do not pay much attention to the art , but since i wasn't very enjoying the first half series (sorry i keep repeating this) , i take a good look at it anyway. there's nothing special about the art, but it's good. I love the details on the future gadgets, the computers, even the writing on the whiteboard is neat. There's no wow factor to it but overall, i have no problem with it.
SOUND - 10 
There's not much to talk about . The voice actors did a very good job, even the ost are beautiful.
CHARACTERS - 10
I really like the characters especially Okabe Rintarou. I love the fact that he is a mad scientist instead of a very cool one. He was indeed mad at the beginning but he slowly showed his serious side and his empathy. Ruka Urushibara's gender as a guy is not a surprise since it is very common for a guy to look like a girl in an anime, but it's hard to keep reminding myself he is not what he looks like. I just wish they would show who Daru's future wife is but other than that, the characters are good and together, they created such a good story.
ENJOYMENT - 9
i could give it a 10 if it's not because of the first half series . but mostly, i truly enjoyed it. i love the plot twists and the quotes. There might be a lot to take in to some people, like myself, i couldn't understand it just by watching that i had to do research and read discussions about what's really happening. But the fact that it's a little complicated is what amaze me. How did the creator came up with this brilliant story line and concept in the first place ? 
Overall, i would give it a 9. I love the ending and it couldn't have ended any better. 
""Everyone gets help from someone else at some points in their lives , so someday you should help someone too"" - Amane Suzuha
""I've only lived 18 years, but i don't want to change any of them, they're all parts of my life, even the failures."" - Makise Kurisu. 
""No one knows what the future holds, that's why the possibility is infinite"" - Okabe Rintarou",9
"
                Sometimes a curler fate than death awaits us, and some times we have tools to change that. But will it all be worth it at then end if your the only one who knows the truth? In fact will it be worth it to go through the even curler task of changing it?
I normally avoid watching Time related animes because it is very very hard to find a way to display a non linear sequence of events, due to the nature of the idea of time traveling, into a linear sequence making it very very hard to accomplish. However Stines;Gate manages to do just that.
                  I will still be using my own rating scale of 50/30/10/10 to rate this anime and here is a break down of my scale 
50 points for plot/story
30 points for character
10 points for sound
10 points for art
totaling to 100
Plot story 49/50
The plot of this anime is very twisted and very ""tripy"" to some people. The main reason that some people may be discouraged to continue watching past episode 1 is because it uses a mechanism too hook the viewer's attention that is seldom used in story telling, it invokes confusion upon the viewer. Majority of stories uses either shock to hook the viewer in or attempting to invoke their curiosity. When a mix of both is used, confusion is one of the many different type of feelings that the viewer will get depending on how the opening is planned. This confusion is arguably the only down side to the plot.
However once you get past the initial confusion you will start to understand what is actually happening and the introduction phase of the anime then begins. This is where they establish who the characters are and what they are as well as small mini plots in here. What is most amazing about Stines;Gate is that it manages to not completely waist this part of the anime. Instead of only introducing small mini plots to go with each character it also manages to make these mini plots relevant later on. A lot of anime will waist this part where after introducing the characters, they will forget about the happenings of the introduction and move on. 
Probably the biggest and most important part of Stines;Gate is the fact that the plot isn't strait forward but twisted. This, too, is likely due to the nature of the idea of time traveling. Because time travel doesn't exist in real life (yet), story writers are free to describe it however they want and use whatever method of making it appealing as possible allowing for the most twisted plot imaginable. Miraculously, Stines;Gate manages to do this all without confusing the viewers as most other Time Travel related Plots will end up confusing the viewer. 
Character 26/30
My over all complaint with the characters is that they are not as static as they should be if they are to be held up to the standards of the way the plot worked. You may not understand this but you will find later that characters will show growth even though we are revisiting the past form of the character. 
Another disappointment is the rapid changes in the Okabe's personality yet the stable progress mid way through. I can assume that the production have yet to firmly decide on a personality for him to take on in the beginning but has firmly confirmed that after. A good thing throughout though is that they have manage to keep the fundamental characteristics about his character consistent throughout the show making him a very lovable character to watch. Okabe's character returns to his original state near the end so its all good
The majority of the humor from this anime mainly comes from the differences between each character's personality and the way they interact. The most funny moments are when Okabe interacts with Kurisu as their characters are essentially polar opposite, but it is most heart wrenching when they manage to get along despite their differences. Lets just say the characters manage to pull off being extremely funny while playing an extremely dark plot.
Sound: 8/10
The sound is actually kind of disappointing compared to the rest of the anime. However it is still great. I guess if your so into the anime that you don't notice the sound then its isn't really a big deal. this actually isn't one of my strengths so I cant really talk much about it. However I will say that the third ending is my personal favorite song from the anime. 
Art: 10/10
I'm going to start off by saying that this anime has found the perfect art style for each of its mini and main plots throughout while maintaining consistency throughout. Of the really dire situations the colors all seem to fit together and give you the hopeless feeling that the character is experiencing while the upbeat moments, the colors and visuals really express these feelings of happiness. The most memorable moments are probably when the mood is very depressing while the surrounding is suggesting a very happy mood which surprisingly doesn't conflict with the mood but strengthens the mood. 
The character themselves are very nicely designed because you can easily identify them. even if you dont know their names you will know who they are. Each character has a unique color scheme and is strictly followed. even if they aren't wearing their default clothing, you will still be able to recognize them and that's a hint of good character design.
over all:
49/50
26/30
8/10
10/10
--------
93/100
roughly 9/10
If I can slap a 10 on this I would. The plot is just that good however the characters needed a bit of work to me and hence I cant give it a 10 (on a more personal level plot is 75% of the importance in an anime to me so we can pretend that this got a 10).
 I will assume that the Visual Novel for this anime is better executed as that seems to be the case with most animes that are originally from another medium other than animation. However i haven't actually played the Visual Novel I am unable to say that for sure. If your ready to have your mind blown then I would highly recommend this anime. If not then I guess its better that you wait till your mind is ready to be blown before watching.",9
"
                After finishing this series, I felt so overwhelmed that I figured I had to dedicate my first anime review to Steins;Gate. I started watching this anime because of two reasons, 1. The ratings were too good to be true; 2. I like time-travelling and scifi genres. So to begin I was already harbouring high expectations for this anime. 
I had read somewhere that the first few episodes were more sliceoflife typed rather than thriller, and true enough, in the first few episodes we are introduced to the various characters, and we learn about their antics, their behaviours, and them as a whole. The character development
                  in Steins;Gate is beautifully done and unlike half-assed supporting characters, we are rewarded with well-designed and realistic character personality and premises that make each and everyone of them unique and essential in bringing this anime to life. 
When watching the first few episodes, you may feel like giving up because the story is admittedly slightly boring at the beginning, adopting a slower pace without much sci-fi and thriller that we all came looking for when we decided to watch this anime. HOWEVER, DO NOT STOP WATCHING. I cannot repeat this enough. Your patience will be rewarded at the end and things only get better and better. 
Steins;Gate is one of the few shows that have managed to blow my mind away with its amazing, detailed and well-planned storyline that makes you go EUREKA I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING NOW with just a single revelation at the very end. It does this magic where it doesn't straight out tell you in exposition, but it reveals it in a way where you are involved first-handedly and you experience the same emotions the characters are going through. 
Now being a fanatic over this whole concept of time travelling, I'm not easily satisfied with just another time travel story that's plot is most often overused, confusing, contradictory and straight out poorly executed. BUT Steins;Gate has done this brilliant feat whereby it has set fixed rules about the way time works on its world and how things are affected by it. Additionally, the story was quoted to be ""99% science and 1% fiction"" and it is true to a large extent because the theories used in Steins'Gate are backed by actual theories that are widely believed in the science world. This anime also reminds me of the movie Interstellar, so if you enjoy Interstellar, you will enjoy this too. 
(slight spoilers)
Finally, although this isn't a romance genre anime, a beautiful tragic love story is smartly masked under the fa√ßade of a sci-fi movie. The relationships and interactions between okabe, mayuri and kurisu is done so well that you can't help but be pained by the circumstances that okabe has to go through. 
Overall, YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS ANIME.",10
"
                This anime is one of the greatest I have seen. The story line sucked me and made we watch the whole series quickly. Of course I liked it because I am a computer science major but this is definitely for nerds of my caliber.
Storyline 10: I enjoyed it because of the science actually behind the anime which makes it amusing to watch. The best part is that everything is that there are no plot holes unsolved by the concussion of the series, which makes the viewer feel at ease with no unanswered questions. If the viewer enjoys thinking a lot about science and computers and
                  si-fi then the viewer will find this anime to be interesting.
Art 10: The characters are very will drawn with exceptional detail. Background and stage sets are well drawn as well with high detail in notes unlike other anime that just draw scribbles. Instead of half assing the characters emotions like most anime there is great detail put into making facial expression. One of the best parts of the art is the visual effects for scientific phenomenon that they discover. Also flash backs are easily distinguishable from the original story line.
Sound 9: The audio for the characters contain multiple inflections to help the viewer experience a connection to the feeling of the characters current state. The sound is well put together and flows with the story. Also the opening song is very interesting and has a unique sound.
Characters 10: I absolutely love every character because they are compiled of multiple emotions and characteristics that make them stand out from other anime. Characters are often driven by emotions and difficult decisions to help them grow and become a better character. 
I will definitely re-watch this one on the big screen because of the art and sound effects of this well produced anime. Remember that this review refers to those who love computer science and crazy scientists.",10

                ""I've only lived 18 years, but I don't want to change any of them. They're all part of my life, even my failures."" - Kurisu Makise
This quote summarize the message of the show pretty well, Steins;Gate is ironically a time travel shows that teaches the us to accept our past no matter how tragic it might be because those tragedies are what makes us who we are. The show also encourage us to face our fear as we get to witness all of the characters doing the same thing while also introducing us to the believe that there's no predetermined future so we can move
                  forward with hope.
Steins;Gate does what it aimed to do flawlessly, it sets the correct expectations from the beginning minutes of the show. It then continues with engaging progress that ends with an extremely satisfying conclusion for the target audiences. However, are you the target audience? How do you know if the show suits your taste? Well, all of it is hinted at the first episode, from the type of characters it's aiming for to the strong traits of the plot, the traits of the setting, the art style and the type of soundtrack. 
Plot Type: Steins;Gate whole identity relied on the tonal shift in episode 12, the first half is a brilliantly executed slice of life comedy with mysteries while the second half is a full blown high stake sci-fi thriller. The absent of comedy in the second half intensify the tension, and create empathy between the protagonist and the audience through the feelings of loneliness and yearning to get back the peaceful days. On the other hand, the mysteries make the plot twists satisfying and believable. There will be around 3 mysterious events and characters behaviors being introduced to the audience per episodes in the first half, it's a relatively fine pacing if you ask me, enough to digest and spark curiosity. If you're the type of audience who love putting things together and making up your own theories of what's happening, it'll be a treat since you'll be engaged for the whole show. The first halves provides questions and the second half provides answers, making the whole story feels connected instead of disjointed despite the significantly different tone each halves have. In the first half, apart from the mysteries, not a single scene is wasted and each dialog is used to establish characters relationships, build a running gag, progress the plot or all of them at once. 
Characters Type: Steins;Gate are made up of well executed and subverted character archetypes, including - Chuunibyou, Pervert Otaku, Bakadere, Tsundere, Dandere, Trap, Cat Maid, DereDere and Daughter-con. All of the comedic effects of these archetype will be tone to the top and later traumatically subverted to increase tension, if you enjoy that type of comedy and want to experience some breathtakingly meaningful tragedy then this is your show. 
Setting Type: The universe of Steins;Gate is similar to the world of our own, Akihabara is full of Otaku culture and the character utilized this pretty well since they all have traits that represent that setting. Apart from that, the time travel system have distinct rules that are later used to problem solve supplement the characters, plot and theme well. The whole ""convergence"" time travel mechanic is based on the philosophical believe of fatalism and the characters have to fight against that. The show kept track of worldlines so well that fans nowadays can't find any plot holes (as in mistakes that betray the established rules of that universe from the plot)
Art: The show utilize everything from the color pallet, lightning, story boarding, visual effects, character animation and combat animation to communicate the tone, characterize, control tension and provide thematic symbolism. I personally love the art style, if you want to know if your taste suits the art style of the show, just try watching the first episode and find out.
Sound: The sound effects, OP and ED themes, OST, insert songs, voice acting are all used to supplement the emotional experience of the story. I personally love the soundtrack, if you want to know if your taste suits the show's musical identity, try searching on Youtube ""Gate of Steiner"" or ""Believe Me"" and try them out. 
TL;DR Flawless writing, audio and visual that all works towards the same goal of enhancing the emotional experience and message for the target audience. You'll enjoy the show if you like mysteries, comedic characters archetypes, setting with distinct rules used for problem solving, philosophical themes and if the art and soundtracks suits your taste.  10/10",10

                Good enough for one time watch. And as for a time travel fiction, nothing impresses me after watching Doctor Who. Wasn't impressed by Steins; Gate either.
Mayuri's Tuturu is super annoying. -_-

                Time travel as a plot device has always been a dangerous one to use to drive a story forward. It adds an immediate degree of complexity as soon as the rules are defined. Writing time travel into a story has the pitfall of writers not only writing themselves into a corner, but also creating continuity errors on top of that. However, when defined and used appropriately, time travel serves to be an excellent plot device.
Steins;Gate is an example of a story with ‚Äúgood‚Äù time travel. The series starts off on the same level as the viewer in terms of understanding time travel. The characters know
                  no more than we do about the rules or even the possibly of time travel. We get to watch as they build a machine capable of sending text messages to the past and exploring all the consequences that result. As the show progresses, we learn through their experience and mistakes. In the meantime, the character development, pacing, and tone of the show only serve to strengthen the plot.
For a show that‚Äôs centered around the concept of time travel, Steins;Gate never really focuses in on it. The initial discovery was an accident. The main character, Okabe Rintaro, and the other characters are interested, but aren‚Äôt obsessed with its possibilities. Even the main female protagonist, Makise Kurisu, who is a world-renown genius, isn‚Äôt defined by her interest and subsequent involvement with the time machine. Rather, the show is described as a group of kids who are members of the‚ÄùFuture Gadget Laboratory,‚Äù and discover that one of their inventions is possible of relaying messages to the past. And for first few episodes, the show focuses on the first part. Once the the time travel mechanics get introduced, the story is driven by the motivation of the lab members without spending too much time on the what-ifs.
Okabe is the main driving force of the series. Even with the fact that there is a conspiracy theory that he is trying to unravel, our main focus is still on Okabe and his relationships. The concerns of the mechanics are introduced and elaborated upon, but never become the spotlight of the series. The interactions of the lab members as they explore time travel serve as the main focus. Throughout the story, I found myself liking the characters more than I‚Äôd thought I would from their short paragraph description on Wikipedia. This is how character development is supposed to work. This is why when things get real halfway throughout the series, I get thrown into a story where I‚Äôm legitimately worried about what‚Äôll happen to everyone.
I‚Äôll admit that the first half of the show seemed slow and almost necessary, but in the end, I‚Äôm glad that they took to time to introduce everyone before we just suddenly care about the more drastic events. Along with the excellent characters, Steins;Gate really knows how to set the atmosphere, especially in the scenes where Okabe questions his own sanity. They never bring it up as a point in conversation or blatantly point it out with an obnoxious monologue. We watch as Okabe experiences certain events with an unsettled air. Okabe and the viewer will notice that something is off, but have no proof to what it was. Building suspense in this manner was one of the best part of the series. Withholding information that the characters know from the viewer is a common method of forced suspense, and it doesn‚Äôt build atmosphere, just aggravation. (I‚Äôm looking at you, Gosick.)
Overall, I enjoyed Steins;Gate. I had my doubts at the beginning with the show‚Äôs initial light tone, but the doubts quickly disappeared. The clich√© anime humor suddenly became amusing once a layer of 2ch meta-humor started getting thrown into the mix. The pacing and tone had me cursing at my monitor every time an episode ended, especially towards the end. Character development was a welcome aspect with the series responsibly limiting its characters and finishing their respective plot lines.  While I consider the ending a bit too happy and convenient, I‚Äôm still pleased with the time on spent on this show. It certainly didn‚Äôt disappoint.",9

                This is my first review, so please excuse the length of the review, and the quality of it. I also apologize if my review is off track.
""This is the choice of Steins;Gate"" - Okabe Rintarou 
I don't really enjoy sci-fi animes, but when I stumbled apon this, after reading reviews, I decided to give it a try. As I watched each episode made me feel edgy on whats ganna happen next, sometimes it threw me off track resulting me to stop and think before continuing with the anime. Steins;Gate did a great job in keeping me hooked from the very beginning, I never lost interest.
                  I question if things turning into gel after trying to physically time travel has any impact on the story, but the main question is does everything have an infinite loop? With Steins;Gate story about time traveling, phone microwaves, and scientific theories, it can make anyone question if time traveling possible. Steins;Gate had interesting and loveable characters that are also unforgettable, the voice actors do a perfect job as there characters.
Overall Steins;Gate is a great Sci-Fi and Thriller anime that i Recommned everyone should give it a try, it will be worth your time.

                So after putting off completing this series for so long, I've finally finished it and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and see now why it's held in such high regard. I was completely disinterested with the show at first and it took me until the seventh episode to feel like the main plot of the show presented itself to me. From that point onward, it was interesting to see how the story unfolded and the character exposition and development especially for the main character,  Okabe. By the end I felt that everything made sense and it more than made up
                  for how I felt initially about the show. I'll conclude by saying that this is an anime I would recommend you give a watch if you're still trying to decide whether to give it a chance or not.",10

                ""I am Mad Scientist, IT'S SO COOL""
Steins; Gate is a anime released in 2010 and I chose this anime for my first review because it is my favorite anime so far. It takes place in present day (2010) Akihabara Japan following the story of Okabe Rintarou, and his fellow lab members who accidentally discover a way to send text messages in the past to change present day. Without further ado, let us begin the review.
Story - 10/10
As most people would probably expect, there are likely to be many plot holes in this story especially since it involves time travel, and of course with time travel
                  there are bound to be plot holes. Steins; Gate is one of the rare exceptions to this rule. While there are minor ones (the very existence of time travel in the first place), they did a very good job by keeping all their rules consistent throughout the entire anime with little to no mistakes at all. Most things can be explained with the addition of future or previous episodes. For those wondering what kind of Time Travel theory they are using, it is one involving ""world lines"" and whenever someone changes something in the past, all people will switch world lines. For example, if there are two people named Person A and Person B. If one travels back in time and kills the parents of one of them (example, Person B kills parents of Person A) the world line will switch to one in which Person A never existed and everyone's memories will be altered so that they have no knowledge of Person A.
Now for the actual story, note, there will probably be some very minor spoilers, so no promises on spoiler free.
Okabe and his fellow lab members in Future Gadget Lab (really just a run down apartment) have discovered a way to send text messages back to the past accidentally with their device Phone Microwave (name subject to change). However, upon this discovery, drastic things happen which send Okabe on a journey to revert everything to the way it was before this all happened.
Surprisingly, for a kind of simple story, they do it very well. The start however, is extremely slow and does not move into any major plot points until around halfway through with a very significant event. However, they make up for this with some witty jokes and the stellar ending that wraps everything up nicely, making everything make sense in the end. There have rarely been any mistakes or any discontinuities which is why I give the story a 10/10 for it's perfect execution and ending.
Art - 10/10
This is more personal opinion rather than anything, so I'll keep this section short. This is very well drawn, and rarely have there been any ""weird"" proportions and the art style is consistent throughout the entire story.
Sound - 10/10
Again, also personal opinion rather than anything, I felt that the opening fitted the theme perfectly and the rest of the soundtrack matched wherever it was playing. The soundtrack is amazing, and I made it a point to learn how to play Gate of Steiner on the piano for my own personal enjoyment.
Character -  9.5/10
While the characters to develop very well later on, some characters you still aren't too certain about. For example, Moeka (Shining finger) you don't really learn why she always prefers texting instead of actually speaking. But all the other characters are developed nicely and relations between characters are very nice. I felt extremely attached to all the characters, face palming myself whenever they did something dumb, crying whenever something terrible happened, and even laughing along with them.
Enjoyment - 10/10
With well timed jokes, excellent executions, cliffhangers that always leave you wanting more, and an amazing ending that wraps everything up nicely, it would be hard to not rate enjoyment anything lower than a 10/10. I felt that even the humor in the first couple of episodes good enough to make me keep on watching, and that when it finally picked up it was all worth it and the good consistent speed of the plot after that point combined with the ending makes this my favorite anime of all time.
Overall - 10/10",10

                Steins Gate is one of the most popular animes here on MAL, and deserves it. It's about time travellers that get some problems by messing with the time line. 
This show is really suprising when it cames to the characters. Every one could be the main character of it's own show. By saying this i want to tell that every single one is good and you won¬¥t dislike any of them.
About the main characters, Okabe Rintarou. It is really an interesting character and a funny one. He has his child side but when it comes to solve those problems with time we figure out that
                  he is mature enough to make the right choices. So he seems to be a idiot in the first episode, but for me it just emphasizes his adult side. This character has everything to be one of the best characters i've ever seen. It is funny, it is noble, and it is a good partner for the other main character, Makise Kurisu. 
Although Okabe for me, was the one who gave the name to this anime, i felt by wathching different opinions that Makise Kurisu was the best character here. Well it is a good character because it is a clich√™. You can deny it, but you know that it is true. It's the ordinary super genius tsundere girl. However, it stills a good character. Her discussions with Okabe were really fun to watch and some were dramatic enough to make me care about them, so i guess there is no big difference between this 2. Both are excelent and for me, they made this anime worth. 
The art is quite detailed, the characters are well designed, with good color and brightness detail although the background i felt it didn¬¥t match up with the characters detail. 
The soundtrack is also good. That opening is really beautiful, thank god that the opening remained the same throughout the show because it matches perfectly with the show and it is a nice thing to hear before every episode. 
There is just one thing on this show that made me bored. Who told me to watch this one, said that the first 12 episodes were really boring. I didn¬¥t thought it. The first 12 episodes were really funny and the development of the plot made me hooked. Although the other half of the anime .. i guess for something like 4-5 episodes, that anime got lost. Those episodes, they were not Steins Gate .. something else except Steins Gate that i was used to. They focus on what? The drama was not that good. The plot wasn¬¥t being developed neither the romance or comedy. This episodes were boring for me and predictable. No big deal there. Then the rest gets back to normal with that end that made everything right and i think that everyone liked it, furthermore they got back into the plot which i belive it was the best thing to see on this show. 
I recommend this show for everyone, it has a little bit of everything, which make it a good anime and especially, for who loves romance this one is the one that you have to see.",8

                I'm writing this review for people who first got onto this show because of the raving reviews and as they watch it, they're wondering if its going to get any better.
Having finished the entire show, I have to admit that the timey wimey story is clever and well planned, however, whether or not you enjoy this show, highly depending on whether or not you like these ensemble of characters or not.
If you find the characters boring and annoying from the beginning, the enjoyment level of this show will stay low till the end. 
It is not going to get any better, because even though the
                  story is well planned, you just wont give a crap about what's going on because you dont care about these characters.
Especially the girl with the blue hat, since she was sort of the center of the last half of the show where people rave about when it was getting better.
So if you like these characters, then I can see why this show have like very high score here on MAL.
I watched this show because of the raving reviews and this being the no 2 highest score here on MAL, and I kept thinking there must be something awesome happening on this show that I have to finish the entire show.
When I got to the end, I was like yeah it was clever I guess.... but I still dont like it cos these characters are just okay for me, so taste is relative and high score here doesnt guarantee it fits your particular taste.
Another thing, the pacing is reaaaaaalllyyyy slooooowwwwww, and there is veeeryy little big events happening, and even when they happen, they were very... mild... nothing too dramatic or spectacular.
I guess it is expected since since the beginning of the show, they seems to focus to small things that seems trivial instead of anything big and important.
If I can send a D-mail to myself from 2 days ago, I will tell myself not to waste my time watching this entire show and spend that time on something better and more useful instead....",5

                This is my first review so bear with me here. I basically went through the whole trouble of signing up and all just for rating a ten on this and writing a review.
O.M.G.
That was a complete roller coaster. Steins gate is that anime which personifies Time Travel for me. 
Steins gate is a story of love. Its a story of too many emotions just to begin with.
It is that kind of anime in which you sympathize with the character so much. At one point in this I really feel bad for Okabe and realize that Time travel is actually more of a curse than a
                  boon.
No other anime will hype you so much as just to the notion of a ""mad scientist"" putting up a coat as Steins Gate does!
This anime is so awesome that it has both popularity and score in a single digit.
Also, I haven't seen another anime wrap up all the ties any way as Steins Gate does.
Sound: 10/10
Best anime OST that has ever been produced. The opening and ending are so beautiful! I still listen to them now and then. Plus, the ending song in the ep 23 is a gem.
Art: 9/10
As you will notice from the posters and all this anime has a general blue hue to in the majority but this gives a very ""pure and serious"" effect to it.
Concluding, my review here DO NOT WASTE ANOTHER MINUTE THINKING WHETHER TO WATCH IT OR NO. Just go for it!
Signing off,

                Steins;Gate is a good anime. I liked many parts of it and I would recommend watching it to the majority of people reading this review that haven‚Äôt seen it yet if you just want an interesting show with some thrilling moments at various points. It has some flaws that hold it back from being a great anime but it still manages to be quite good in its own right.
Story: Steins;Gate is about a group of college-age kids who are ‚Äúsmart‚Äù scientists that are attempting to find a way to time travel. It is presented well but it was executed weak and could have been done
                  better. I don‚Äôt like the fact that the characters basically fuck something up and then instead of progressing, they spend the whole time trying to fix what they fucked up. I feel like I‚Äôm watching some kids show like Jimmy Neutron because they don‚Äôt go anywhere and they just sort of take 1 step forward and one step back over and over. That‚Äôs how I feel about the series as a whole. Many things had good potential or were going well and then something happens that ruins that progression. Or vice-versa where a specific element of the story starts off bad but gets better but when I think about it as a whole, the bad part of that element of the story weighs it down to being just a bit above average. For example, It starts off like a typical clich√© Slice Of Life but with added science (Which made absolutely no logical sense, but after all, it‚Äôs an anime so‚Ä¶). Later on, the plot becomes interesting and original but all that SOL at the beginning weighs down the good stuff during the second half. It also followed the typical visual novel formula with unoriginal plot devices, characters, and events. PLOT SPOILERS ONLY TO EXPLAIN THE SERIES‚Äô FLAWS IN MORE DETAIL FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THE SHOW AHEAD:
Here are some of the flaws from the show(SPOILERS): The fact that these kids who are like 18 can figure out how to solve the most complicated scientific problems like how to go back in time, how to send messages back in time etc. for no reason except ‚Äúscience‚Äù and the fact that they are supposed to be smart. They do many things that aren‚Äôt smart though, which contradicts the idea the plot has been trying to build up this entire time which is that the characters are smart. An example of this is when they decide to let that moe girl send whatever she wants back in time knowing it could fuck up everything, and when they suddenly can‚Äôt use their intelligence to make some new machine to fix the fact that Serun is after them and when Mayuri keeps dying for the convenience of the plot and instead they just keep screwing things up even worse. The fact that they even let someone really stupid like Mayuri know their classified information that Serun might kill them for, is extremely stupid. The whole idea of world lines was not explained thoroughly enough for example what happens to all the people in the world lines that Kyoma leaves? What happens to Kyoma‚Äôs body after that? IMO I think that the world line thing and the world line convergence was just used for the convenience of the plot as a BS way to get out of their problems. Seriously, how is the idea of just changing things even more in a world line suddenly cause time to do a 180 and turn things back to normal and fix everything ‚Äúscience‚Äù. They mainly use the idea of ‚Äúscience‚Äù as a cheap way of progressing the plot instead of actually making anything in the show make any logical or scientific sense. After all, I can‚Äôt rip on it too much because it‚Äôs just an anime and a science-fiction one at that, after all, it did a far better job at explaining science-fiction concepts than any other science-fiction things I‚Äôve seen. But in the end I believe they still could have done a better job. The ending was surprisingly good and tied up most of the loose ends while making more sense than the rest of the series. It was very entertaining and it was the best part of the series. After all though, the only thing that changes from the beginning to the end is that the characters become better friends and Kurisu and Kyouma start dating. Most of these flaws aren‚Äôt too bad though, I just like to being out the negatives in a show in my reviews instead of just praising it the whole time.
Spoilers are done:
I give the plot an 8/10
Art: I liked the art and animation because it was pleasant to look at. I thought the way that their eyes have a bunch of circles in them and the greyish color pallet fit the show well and added to the atmosphere. It‚Äôs nothing amazing but certainly above-average and good. 8/10
Sound: The opening was spectacular but other than that the soundtrack was ok because it lacked any memorable themes. 7/10 because of the opening.
Characters: Many of the characters were quite clich√©. They had a tsundere, which I thought was a well-done tsundere but not amazing like Asuka, Senjougahara, Casca etc. I say this because tsundere done well don‚Äôt just smack people on the head in a cheesy fashion but instead develop as a character and are shown to be realistic with true feelings and such. Kurisu, the tsundere, has most qualities that a good tsundere has, but they weren‚Äôt done as well as they could have been. They were still done well and I‚Äôm glad she didn‚Äôt turn out like Sakura or Erza and she became something more. Her development was well-done. Then, they have a generic loli called Mayuri who just acts ‚Äúkawaii‚Äù and is really na√Øve and soft hearted. She gets no development and is just used to add to tension to the plot and nothing more in the end. You have the main character, Houin Kyouma, who is a mad scientist with a hilarious laugh who got some good development but it wasn‚Äôt as good as it could have been. He was still a unique and memorable character. Then, there is some moe chick that also acts ‚Äúkawaii‚Äù and gets no development yet again and is just used to add drama to the plot. There is some girl that for no reason, only uses her phone to communicate with others and is basically just fan-service. But seriously, I have literally no idea why she only used her phone to communicate. It was never explained, the viewer is just expected to go along with it for no reason. Yet again, another character is just assigned a random quirk and gets no development. That doesn‚Äôt make for a good character. There is another girl who works in the shop below the characters apartment. She has a surprising secret about her that kind of comes out of nowhere (those of you that have seen the show know what I‚Äôm talking about). She gets some ok development but nothing substantial. Then there is some guy who looks like a girl and acts like a girl and that‚Äôs all there is to him. Finally there is a computer geek who is good with computers and likes moe and that‚Äôs it. I give the characters a 7/10. They had potential, but yet again, they wasted it and only had 3 characters with any sort of real development.
Enjoyment: Personally I enjoyed Steins;Gate a lot and even though I bring up a lot of flaws about the series, they are not bad enough to the point where it ruins the show. The slice of life wasn‚Äôt that bad and it was unique slice of life because it wasn‚Äôt in a high school and only half of the characters were clich√© instead of all of them. I believe it was still worthwhile to watch it. 8/10.
Overall I give Steins;Gate an 8/10, because despite its mild flaws, it was still a good show that I enjoyed a lot which had some well thought twists and turns in the plot that kept me interested most of the time. It is barely an 8 though so it isn‚Äôt as good as most of my other 8‚Äôs.",8

                Contrary to popular opinion, I did not find the the beginning half of Steins;Gate boring at all. Sure, in terms of plot, it is somewhat stagnant, but this is made up for by intriguing character establishment and dynamics. The first half works to establish Okabe as a lazy, carefree, and ostensibly irresponsible ""mad scientist,"" with the show simultaneously taking on this overarching mood, as if it exists only to follow random science experiments.
The show's magic lies in the subversion of this initial characterization, as it firmly juxtaposes indolence with trepidation, innocence with distress, and, most refreshingly, irresponsibility with maturity. The duality of the show and
                  of Okabe himself create a poignant story that is very satisfyingly resolved in the denouement, where not only the plot is moving, but characters feel like they have developed naturally.
Throughout the show, dialogue is compelling, ridiculous, and intelligent, enhancing characters and providing them with distinct and memorable identities. Scientific concepts, while a bit farfetched and admittedly difficult to follow at times, still succeed in captivating the audience, as every exploit that Okabe and his lab undertake is like a leap into the unknown. The art and animation is not much to boast of, but I found that it does not hinder a show such as Steins;Gate as much as it might, for example, Hunter x Hunter. Plus, the pale and lackluster coloration does give it a unique and authentic atmosphere. Last thing that I will say is that Steins;Gate takes you to the depths of every emotion on the spectrum. It is a thriller, a comedy, a romance, a drama, and a slice of life that never feels tied down to one identity, and that makes it truly special.",10

                When I was kid, I started wondering 'What would it be like to control time?'.  How would it be if we had time machines? Can humans ever do something like that? I think we all asked ourselves those questions in some moment of life. We all wanted to go back in time, and change something. This is the anime which shows us one, possible in future, idea of changing present by changing past. But, what will happen if you change past? Maybe you wouldn't change only thing you really wanted to be changed. Doesn't matter how small that thing is, you don't now what
                  it will cause. This show gives you few answers, and makes you think seriously through that topic. 
In this anime, changing past makes serious changes in future, which aren't good.
Story: 10
It is amazing. Really. It will make you watch more and more. It isn't boring for a single minute. Story is really, really interesting, with lots of unexpected scenes. In general, it's about young man Okabe Rintarou, founder of small lab, and his friends. They made a time machine and tried using it. But it didn't go like they wanted. Now Okabe is in very unpleasant situation. Watch and find out what kind of situation, I won't say more because I would spoiler it.
Art: 10
It looks pretty good, I must say. And animation is good too.
Sound:
Voice actors did really good job. You know what characters think, and you know how they feel. I must say they showed us psychological state(I mean condition) in really realistic way.
Sounds and music pieces fit perfectly in moments.
I especially liked opening song.
Characters: 10
Rintarou Okabe - Mayuri gave him nickname Okarin, and he's self-proclaimed Mad Scientist. You have to hear his mad-scientist laugh, haha. I think it's really amazing he didn't go insane after all he went through, and I respect him for everything he did. He's funny in some moments and serious in others. I loved him. 
Mayuri Shiina - She was my favourite character in whole series. She is kind, caring, and really nice person. I'd say she's kinda optimistic, and somewhat naive. She doesn't like people fighting, and wants everyone to be happy. She isn't really good in sciense like Kurisu and Okarin, but she is fine with just being with them. Tuturu!
Kurisu Makise - Genius girl. Scientist. Usually fights with Okarin because he gives her nicknames. She is really cute tsundere. But she truly cares for everyone. I liked her.
Itaru Hashida - He's computer genius of the group. He's good in hacking.  Kurisu usually says that he and Okarin are perverts, which is funny.
Moeka Kiryuu - People usually dislike her. But I think she isn't that bad person after all, she only.... Watch and see.
Suzuha Amane - Something is really interesting about this girl.
Ruka Urushibara - It's actually he. Boy with look and manners 'more feminine than any woman'.
Rumiho Akiha - Also known as Feiris. She nyans (meows) a lot.
Mr. Braun - I actually don't know his real name, haha. Mr. Braun is nickname Okarin gave to him. Okarin pays his rent to him. He has daughter Nae.
Enjoyment: 10 
Every moment is enjoyable. It has everything. Funny moments, happy moments. Sad and depressing moments. Serious moments that make you think. Absolutely interesting anime.
Overall: 10 of course.
I'm in love with this show. I think you'll lose much if you don't take a look at this. Try watching it, and you'll surely fall in love with it.
I'd like to end with ""So now I try to beat time itself with the gadgets I am left with.""
It's not related with this anime, but I'd like to say this too. ""Time waits for no one"", we didn't make time machines yet, so use your time wisely!
This is my very first review.",10
"
                There are a lot of anime shows on time travel, I guess. But Steins;Gate stands out from the rest for a lot of reasons.
a) The rules of the game are well defined
         If a show on time travel doesn't define it's limitations, you could easily start asking questions on paradoxes that should have happened, or loopholes that weren't exploited (it's been three years, and I'm still not done picking on Doctor Who). Steins;Gate explains its theory of time early on in the show itself, leaving no room for that kind of thing.
b) It's got real science.      This show is incredibly well researched. It's interpretation of Chaos Theory and determinism are good enough to be on the first chapter of a college textbook (well, arguably). But a small part, regarding black holes and the like, is somewhat questionable. I guess that's only reasonable, since real science hasn't figured out time travel, while the show has.
The characters were, for me, certainly the best part of the show. Mad scientist, Okabe Rintarou's hilarious spontaineity, his fast-paced, somewhat unintelligible monologues and disconnection with people in general, I found immensely amusing to watch. The characters, without being the kind of people you see everyday, seemed strangely relatable.
However, if you're looking for the kind of smart show that has protagonists making calculated decisions, implicitly asks questions about the meaning of life and the sort, like Psycho-Pass or Death Note, which, for some reason, this show seems to be clubbed with- I don't think you will find it here.
Despite the theme of the show being time travel and science, where the the characters actually do something to figure out how to leap through time, and don't just stumble upon some superhuman ability to do so (which makes you expect really smart people), the protagonists (perhaps, sparing one) do not come across as particularly intelligent, despite being portrayed so. They rarely ask questions about what the consequences of their actions might be- given how messy time travel can be. Through the majority of the show, they sort of just jump through time whenever something they don't like happens. As a result, the potential a show on time travel has for coming with answers regarding the moral dilemma assosciated with changing history remains somewhat unexploited- although, that's probably not what they were going for, any way.
While I don't think the show is as good as reviews seem to claim, it's certainly an amazing show, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a science-y, serious and meaningful, yet lighthearted show.
I give it an 8.5.",8

                Alright, first of all i'm not kind of person who rate's something as ""masterpiece"" so Steins;Gate is the only expectation! 
‚Ä¢ Story/Plot rate (10): 
Probably for many people, same goes for me, the main reason of watching an anime is the story! Steins;Gate has an amazing plot that will blow your minds out! You have to be very concentrated because the vocabulary their using is way below average! 
‚Ä¢ Art + Sound rate (10):
Steins;Gate is not an anime which it has swords and fights or monsters so do not expect something majestic from it but the reason i've rated it's art with 10 marks it's
                  because its really close to reality. The graphics of the anime present today with fully detail (the streets, the cars, people reactions etc.) and the sound was unique! I can't say more about the sound you will understand what i mean if you will watch the anime! 
‚Ä¢ Character rate (10): 
Steins;Gate creators focus a lot on their characters! You will see during the anime that they all have different personalities and attitudes and i believe this makes the anime unique! Also, every character in there it's important!
‚Ä¢ Enjoyment rate (10):
Steins;Gate will play with your mind a lot! That's the most amazing thing about it!",10
"
                Okay now there aren't many words to describe steins gate. I started this anime since it came so highly recommended but the first few episodes made me think that it may have been operated but as it went on, it took me on an unbelievable joy ride.
Note:Okay firstly I don't concern over art and sound much in my reviews so don't expect much detail when it comes to those to aspects of this anime.....
Story: I have watched a lot 8of anime and I must say that Steins Gate has a very good and unique story line that truly is captivating. It passes its self good
                  having a slow beginning, hectic middle and a satisfying end that would put a smile on any body's face so I give it a 10.
Characters: each character is unique and is important to the story in some way though they may not all be the most likable of characters, they all have flae0ws and quirks that I liked since it usually ment an entertaining scene or joke here and there so I give them a 9.
Enjoyment: though it has a slow start by the time things pick up I couldn't help but to keep my eyes glued to this anime. The unique drama, comedy and suspense just worked wonderfully together to give me an experience I won't be forgetting anytime soon so the enjoyment is definitely a 10.
Overall: if your looking for an action packed, superpowered anime then this isn't for you, but if you are looking for a comedic, heart ranching,  unique experience that you'll rarely find in most anime them you just gotta watch Steens Gate",10
"
                I've got to say, this show is pretty over-hyped.
 I was expecting a masterpiece, and judging from the first episode, the series had quite a bit of potential. There was plenty of mystery, and the animation style that seemed almost black-and-white looked fantastic. But as the series progressed, there was a steady nosedive until episode 12, where I burst out laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of it all. 
If you are the type that was legitimately scared that the large hadron collider was going to cause a black hole, then this is the anime for you.  However, if you know the slightest bit about
                  physics, technology, and/or astronomy then you might find yourself facepalming while watching this. 
Granted, I realize this is a science fiction. The premise of the show is that time-travel is achieved through a microwave connected to a phone charger. I was okay with that, as outlandish as it seems. I don't really expect anime to be realistic. The problem is that the series tries to explain the events that go on, but it does so through quantum babble and complete asspulls. 
As for the characters... you have the possibly schizophrenic Okarin, who is by all means an interesting character. I don't have much to say about Mayuri. And then there's Itaru, a gross otaku who is constantly sexually harassing the female characters and has a creepy obsession with this cat lady. The entire series I just wanted to push him off a cliff. Last but not least, there's Kurisu, who is a standard stereotypical tsundere. Basically all the characters save the for MC are either uninteresting or annoying. Or both. 
Let's not forget about the barrage of product placement. There are times when this show seemed like a commercial for Dr. Pepper. 
A note on the fanservice- I normally don't mind fanservice as long as its kept to a minimum, but one thing that does really bother me is the whole ""camera starting at a woman's crotch then panning up to her face whenever she talks"" which they used quite a bit. A personal pet peeve of mine, as it seems pretty degrading. C'mon, at least do the same to the men! Or better yet, don't do it at all. And of course, no anime is complete without an unnecessary shower scene. Steins;Gate is no exception. 
To sum it up, don't watch this show if you have any trouble suspending disbelief when it comes to time-travel via text messages being sent through black holes created by colliding nearly mass-less subatomic particles. Wait no, the black hole just compresses the data in the text message. The actual time travel is made possible by a microwave. God, this show is a mess...",3

                EL. PSY. CONGROO.
Boy, this was a fun time travel anime. Freakin' awesome. I don't give most anime a 10 but this one deserved it.
Story:
   First episode makes no sense whatsoever, but everything in the beginning wraps together in the last few episodes.  The producers executed the time travel theme fairly well in my opinion, even though there were a few flaws. But ain't nobody got time for dat! The story was amazing and completely full of twists and turns that I would've never expected.  Although the end wasn't nearly as climatic as I was expecting, it closed most of the loopholes.
Score:
                  10/10
Art: 
   The art was super unique from anything else I've watched and they succeeded in making the time travel scenes disorienting with all the blurs.  They take a normal city scene and transform it into a time machine arena with all the interesting angles and shots.  Everything looks very realistic, too.
Score: 10/10
Sound:
   Absolutely amazing. They capture the sounds of the microwave whirring to the sounds of cicadas chirping.  Couldn't get anymore realistic.  Even the OST is super addicting and the OP and ED are done by some of my favorite artists.
Score: 10/10
Character:
   Only one lacking a little. The reason is because although character development is always occuring, Okabe is the only one actually developing for reasons that you shall find out later ;)  However the characters are very unique and unlike any anime I've seen.  Especially Daru haha.
Score: 8/10
Enjoyment:
  I enjoyed this anime so much and even though it came off to a slow start, it totally pays off in the end. So keep watching it!! Trust me you shall not regret it!  The twists and turns in this anime were so exciting I was watching episodes until 3 in the morning haha. The time travel is also a theme you rarely see in other anime so it was a really nice change.
Score: 10/10
Overall: 10/10

                Steins;Gate is truly my favorite anime that I have seen so far. At first it may seem a bit confusing to understand, but as it continues, the story grows and latches on to you, making it impossible to stop watching it.
Story: 10
I gave the story a ten because it's very unique and not like any anime I have seen so far. What may seem to be a serious sci-fi anime, turns out to be one filled with romance, and comedy. The story is well made and makes me want to watch more about the characters lives in the future.
Art: 10
The art is truly well done.
                  It can be very light and fun to watch and also very dark for those serious moments. I'm not that picky when it comes to the art style, but I did find the art in Steins;Gate well done.
Sound: 9
The opening theme for this song is truly amazing. I loved it and it matched the theme pretty well. The sound in each episode was lacking in the first few episodes, but it got much better when it added light music instead of cicadas chirping or other miscellaneous sounds. 
Character : 10
There are so many different varieties of characters in Steins;Gate. My favorites are Okabe Rintarou, Makise Kurisu, and Itaru ""Daru"" Hashida. Okabe is very humorous and can be very crazy at points. He is also very kind and serious when a problem occurs. Makise Kurisu is a light tsundere. She isn't very pushy and harsh, but can be ""mean"" towards Okabe and Daru. She is very helpful towards Okabe and truly kindhearted. In my opinion, she is one of the most well made female characters in all the anime I have watched. Lastly is Daru. He is a nerdy otaku who is perverted, but is actually a very important character. He is the one who does the work in the lab, and still finds time for his own hobbies, such as visiting May Queen Nyan Nyan and Doujinshi events. I found all the characters in Steins;Gate vert well made and indifferent from characters in other works.
Enjoyment: 10
I truly enjoyed watching Steins;Gate. At first, it may seem tough to follow, but in the end, it turns out to be wonderful, and gave me a warm feeling inside.
Overall: 10
Overall, this anime was amazing. There was barely anything I disliked. The story was well made, the characters were different, and I can tell a lot of work was put into the creation of it. Steins;Gate may seem very lighthearted, but as it continues on, the lives of the characters change and they must go through a lot to revert back to a good life.",10

                I tend to be very skeptical about both visual novel adaptations and time travel-related stories. In the first case, it's very easy to have a boring, dialogue-based story with serious problems of pacing; in the second case (and not only regarding anime) it's FAR too easy to construct an over-complicated plot with more holes than a Western movie bad guy after his showdown with the hero. 
Still, Steins;Gate is praised by many people, bot for the original visual novel and the anime adaptation courtesy of White Fox studio, so I decided it was worth checking out and boy, am I thankful for that. Steins;Gate proved
                  to be one of my top 3 anime I've ever watched (for the time being at least) by defying those prejudices I described above and offering as a result an amazing story with superb characters and more.
Stens;Gate is the story of Rintaro Okabe, a.k.a. the self-proclaimed ""mad scientist"" Kyouma Hououin, a very eccentric student with his own world of evil organizations and conspiracies. He runs the Future Gadget Lab along with his childhood friend Mayuri and his right arm, the ""super hacker"" Daru; in this place, the three spend a fair share of their time, devising inventions known as future gadgets. One of these inventions, the Phone Microwave, is in fact more than it seems and it's the prime mover of a story which will lead them to know many other characters while modifying the past and jumping between timelines. 
I really don't want to spoil anything more about the plot, as it clearly is one of the strongest points about the entire productions. Far for being a mere sci-fi story about time travels, it has many ingredients for a great deal of depth. Steins;Gate does not lack in variety: it ranges from slice -of-life comedy to romantic drama to thriller to science fiction to psychological drama and it does this so seamlessly it's bound to hook you without fail. The plot starts a bit slow and in a way that may result confusing to some, but it never becomes boring: every episode gives you a piece of the puzzle and at the end of the ride it's really not hard to have a clear vision of the whole (this is a big eff you to all those anime which are complex and cryptic for the sake of it, irritating the viewer more than anything else). Meanwhile, it takes the time to make you familiarize with the various characters in a very natural way: especially in these aspects the story is built with a fair share of pauses, silences and not-so-conventional ways and this surely contributes to the sense of uniqueness Steins;Gate has. The unusual pace is however carefully planned out and magnetic, and it is aided by creative direction and bold frames for an identity all its own.
Of course pacing and finesse in direction are but a part of the picture: the sheer quality of the plot and the superb characters have an equally important role. Every character make certain decisions and have to come to terms with the consequences: everyone is given their space. There is not much room for development, but that is a plot-based choice and totally understandable. The exception is of course our Okabe, an absolute incredible character who undergoes a massive transformation as the episodes advance. His struggle is dramatic and intense, one of the highest points of the entire production.
The art is clear and appealing, while a bit generic at times, and it's accompanied by good-quality animations (with occasional imperfections, rare and small but present). The soundtrack is a good companion to the scenes, nothing particularly outstanding though; it's worth mentioning that the opening is very catchy and fitting, as the ending theme, and that the Italian dub is really magnificent, with an amazing performance from the voice actors, really heartfelt and immersive.
All-in-all Steins;Gate will not be remembered because of its (albeit pretty good) production values, but for the amazing direction, the hooking, multi-faceted plot, the fluid and impeccable pace and the superb characters. It's really an amazing anime which I'd recommend to anyone.

"
                Hello there! This is my first review so I'd like some feedback if possible on my profile(not necessary of course if you don't want to). I've done my best to create a spoiler-free review and I think I've done a pretty good job at that. Let's begin!
Story: 10
*Steins;Gate has a slow start(that isn't bad actually) but the beginning episodes are very important. Don't give up after the first couple episodes. Trust me and everyone else who has praised Steins;Gate and continue watching this amazing anime!*
""To rule time is to rule the world."" Yes, as you may have guessed or heard about from every other person
                  praising Steins;Gate, it's a show about time travel but trust me when I say this is quite different from anything you've seen before. Meet Okabe Rintarou, or as he prefers to call himself ""Mad Scientist Hououin Kyouma"", a young scientist constantly attempting to create new inventions when one day he stumbles upon a device created in his lab that allows one to travel through time. I won't go into much detail for fear of spoiling any of the greatness of Steins;Gate so I'll leave it at that as far as in depth information goes. 
This anime follows a linear storyline and as for genres really has a bit of everything. Steins;Gate will make you laugh AND cry. It can be silly one moment, and be extremely intense the next making for what may appear to some as a jack of all trades but that statement doesn't do Steins;Gate the justice it deserves. Steins;Gate is more than a jack of all trades as it's a master of all at the same time. One interesting note is that there tends to be two types of story-lines in an anime. There are plot driven stories and there a character driven stories. Both are perfectly fine and can be done well. Steins;Gate though, feels as if it's a combination of the two. Both character and story driven. This combo that isn't really seen to often aids Steins;Gate in creating one of the most memorable adventures in all of anime. 
Art: 8
The art is the weakest point of Steins;Gate I'd have to say and for the weakest point to be an 8 shows how great of an anime this truly is. Now don't get me wrong though, the art in Steins;Gate is in no way bad as an 8 indicates ""very good"" and it's deserving of that rating as it's obviously not going to be on the level of ""Attack on Titan"" for example. The characters are all drawn well and are diverse and the setting itself, Akihabara Japan, proves to be quite the interesting city with a heavy moe influence, done very well as it's considered to be an ""Otaku cultural center"". There's not much to say about the art, it's very good and it gets the job done.
Sound: 9
The sound in Steins;Gate is an odd thing to rate and I guess should really be split into the voice acting and the overall soundtrack itself. Our protagonist Okabe is voiced by Mamoru Miyano. Now, I'm not someone who knows voice actors at all since I generally don't care but this man deserves a lifetime achievement award. His other characters include Light from Death Note, Masaomi from Durarara!! and Ling from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood just to name a few, is so cool! Sunovabitch(you'll figure out the reference later, trust me). Miyano is truly a genius and this performance is easily one of the greatest in anime history. All of the other voice actors are amazing also but the portrayal of Okabe easily makes the voice acting deserving of a 10.
As for the soundtrack itself, the opening to Steins;Gate is one of the best in anime history. No questions asked. I'd rank it in my top 10 openings ever I think but it'd probably break into my top five. Don't believe me? Here it is:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEcPbr1f4Nc
Dont you just love that buildup? As for the rest of the soundtrack, nothing is too memorable to be honest. While there's nothing wrong with the sound in Steins;Gate, nothing stands out except for the amazing opening. I've gone back and listened to some stuff though and it is pretty good I must say so trust me, you won't be disappointed. Honestly, the best thing about most of the tracks is that they are perfect for what they are, background music. Steins;Gate most of the time isn't built up by the music but through the actions of the characters or the great dialogue so the dominance of the sound would actually only serve as a hinderance. 
Overall, I award the sound a 9 due to the 10 in the voice acting and I'd say a mid-8 in the soundtrack itself as it does what it needs to do. While that averages to above a 9, I'll leave it there since it's not worthy of a perfect 10 either and it makes sense for rounding. 
Characters: 10
As I said before, Steins;Gate is both character AND plot driven but what is a anime with a heavy character driven side to it without great characters? Well, Steins;Gate has great characters so that last question really doesn't matter. The majority of our characters serve as members of Okabe's lab and to be honest, describing many of them would spoil the story so take my word when I say that they're all great. To not spoil things, here's one point I can say. All of our characters have a very diverse personality and serve different roles creating wonderful interaction amongst them. This aids Steins;Gate in creating a very immersive setting as the characters are all very relatable and you'll find yourself going through the motions with them every step of the way. You feel their emotions, you cheer them on and you will definitely become attached to them. 
Enjoyment: 10
Some people value enjoyment more than others do and I'm one of those people. Enjoyment in my eyes is the most important factor in an anime because if you didn't like it, then who cares how good the art and sound is or how interesting the characters are? The only thing about enjoyment though is that it's pretty hard to describe it. Steins;Gate is an adventure like no other and despite its slow start is one of the most enjoyable anime out there as once you get past the entry episodes(which once again, aren't bad actually) you'll be wanting more and more until you reach the amazing and powerful end of this masterpiece and still be dying for more(lucky for you, there's an OVA and a movie!). 
Overall: 10
As I've described above, Steins;Gate is easily worthy of a 10 and is a true masterpiece always vying for my top spot as my favorite anime ever. If you haven't seen Steins;Gate, you've done something wrong somewhere in your life and it's time to make up for that! I'm not one to care about where an anime sits on MAL's top anime list based on everyones ratings combined but Steins;Gate is truly worthy of being the second highest rated anime ever.",10

                This is the FIRST TIME that I write a review, and I am a brazilian, and I would like to say sorry if I make some mistakes...
The sound. (10/10)
Yes, I will start here; The soundtrack is absolutely BEAUTIFUL, the openings and endings too, but why? The soundtrack fits a lot with the anime, every moment, every scene, and the openings and the endings are beatiful too, the openings and endings fits a lot with the anime, so I think that is an outstanding sound.
Character. (10/10)
The characters have a great development and are charismatic, and the first Half of the anime (the first 12 or 13
                  episodes) focuse in the character development, and they are such important episodes, at least for me.
Art and Animation. (8,5/10)
(Art) (9/10)
I would like to say that the art is a ""normal"" art, but a good art, it is because of that, that I dont give a 10/10.
(Animation) (8/10)
I think everybody knows that White Fox it is a great studio; White Fox animated Re:Zero, and Akame ga Kill, and in the animation part, and I think they did a great job, but in Steins;Gate, I think that was a ""normal"" animation, but it wasn't bad, so a 8/10 for animation is fair, I think.
Story. (10/10)
I think Steins;Gate have an almost perfect history, and is a well told story too. For me, the story is the best part of Steins;Gate.
Enjoyment. (10/10)
I like the time travels theme, and I think it is a great idea for use in books, animes, mangas, (etc). So I enjoyed a lot Steins;Gate, but I think the enjoyment is something more personal than critical.
Overall. (10/10)
As you see, for me Steins;Gate is a masterpiece, and it is my favorite anime too, so the overall is a 10/10, hope you liked the review.",10
"
                It's hard to find words to describe how much Steins;Gate is a masterpiece, but try to talk a little about Steins;Gate is amazing the beginning and the end, the plotTwist are amazing and beautifully crafted, every plot that the anime presents gets you ecstatic.
Looking now at the plot, this is undoubtedly the key point of the work. It is simply brilliant! The mysteries created around some characters, the most unexpected happenings, the theories presented for the consequences that time travel entails, all fit perfectly like a simple puzzle.
Don't get into why people don't enjoy the beginning of the anime so slow, but this slow pace
                  is what sets the story apart.
The characters are amazing and very well written, I think it's amazing how even the most hated character can play a pivotal role throughout history.
 Steins soundtrack;Gate is one of the most amazing things I have ever heard, in both the stress and quiet parts, a masterpiece needs a loud soundtrack, right?
No doubt Steins;Gate is the best anime ever.",10
"
                This is my first review, i couldn't think of a better anime to be my first ;). I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Story: The story line is amazing and well put together. This anime had me at the edge of my seat, I felt like i was on a roller coaster actually.. I felt like i was walking at the edge of the Empire State building with no parachute. I love the concept of time travel and steins gate really nailed it.
Art: Artwork is great its on par with current 2015 anime in my opinion. 9/10 wish the background was more detailed but the story
                  line so awesome I barely noticed. 
Sound: Love the intro and the and ending. Music was integrated very well 
Character: 10/10 for all characters in this anime, each individual character played little roles that sums up to a bigger picture once it clicks in your head. The MC is very relate-able 
Enjoyment: 10/10 wishing for a season 2 but sadly its canceled :( The ova's are a must watch it fills in the gap at the end.
Overall:10/10 overall experience made me want more. Hopefully I didn't type too much.",10
"
                What seperates Stein's Gate from other shows about time-we're counting all popular time shows and literature here- is it's willingness to dive into the realm of complicated time mechanics. In most shows, time travel is ""Let's press the button, and teleport back 20 million years, and that's that"". But in Stein's gate we get creative analysis of another angle on the time-travel that breaks the paradigm.  The new angle on top of genuinely interesting characters(mainly Okabe) sets the tone for an enjoyable anime. However, what makes Stein's Gate interesting can also make it a little frustrating, as viewers can get easily get caught with
                  the speed in which the creators of the anime expect the viewers to grasp the detailed concepts.",9

                [GOOD THINGS TAKES TIME]
[STORY (10)] This anime represent a good story takes time. They did have a slow burn plot, which is good. Why? Here's why:
1. Time travel is a complicated stuff. In order to create a masterpiece story regarding time travel, it takes time. You need to make sure the he explanation has to be crystal clear.
2. It represent a process, cause it's science after all. First thing you gotta do when you found things like time machine, you have to test it, but slowly, cause there are so many possibilities and consequences if you're messing with time line.
3. They provide a good build
                  up. Like I said, good things takes time to built. They spread clues and stories all over as a pieces, and in the end, they took all of them and put them into one big piece.
Also, in the end, with that kinda story build up, with clues and pieces all over around, with a proper portion of clues, they turn the story upside down, and made it into a roller-coaster adventure. It's an obvious 10/10 anime. If you trash this anime, I doubt that you're watching the same steins gate as I watched
[ART (9)] The character design and animation clearly still needed to be developed even more. But the production design was absolutely incredible. The visual choice, the style, the color palette, all were great. They had some really unique visual choice. The use of the lighting in this series, even with no significant gore, you can still feel the cruelness of the story through the incredible color grading. The angle from many shots were incredibly done.
[SOUND (9)] They needed work more on sound effects. They used too many same sound effects even when it's a different object. Like when they open the door and when they hit people, they used the same sound. On top of that, the op and the ed was stunning!! I really love both song. Not only that, the musical scoring on this show was also exceptional! They're just really good, especally when they started to hit on that violin and keyboard. The voice actors also delivered a good performance. Their voice was as emotional as the character. When the character putting a scared expression, the voice actor's voice also represent a terrified feelings.
[CHARACTER (10)] The other thing I love about this show is the character development, also the character portion for the story. There's no unused character. They all have a proper portion to build the story. It makes us more care about those character. And those character also reliable. Cause they really represent mankind with their own ego, selfishness, desperation, not able to letting go of something, sacrifices, and love. 
[ENJOYMENT (10)] Even with a slow plot at the first, but I do really enjoyed it. As a mystery story fan, I've already get used to with confusion at the first, because they spreading all the clues everywhere. It keeps me guessing all the time. There's no forced comedy, forced emotion, forced sadness, everything was done very naturally which made it very enjoyable. This isn't just exhausting for my brain, it was also emotionally exhausting
NOTE:
If you have any friends who said this anime is trash, or not impressed with this anime, be careful. They might be from the organization or even SERN.",10

                Steins;Gate as of the August 2016 is ranked as the third best anime of all time according to the opinions of myanimelist users. Most of the time, whether it is in novels, television or cinema, the subject of time travel makes the story either extremely convoluted or downright stupid. However, this is not the case with Steins;Gate, as almost every single detail makes sense when you think about the show after watching it, unlike other time travel stories when you suddenly dawn on the inconsistencies as you give them some thought.
Art (10/10):
Steins;Gate has the ability to switch its visuals from dark and shadowy to gorgeously
                  vibrant and colorful with flair. The lighting and everything else in between always complement whatever scene is currently taking place.
Sound (8/10):
First off, I have to mention that the opening theme for this anime, ""Hacking to the Gate"", is an absolute joy to listen to. It perfectly encapsulates the struggle that each of the main characters are facing, and it highlights the brother-sister dynamic that we would see between Okabe and Mayuri during the course of the actual series. However, the score itself of the Steins;Gate wasn't anything special. There were times it made me tear up, and times when I felt the music sounded too corny and cheesy and that the scene would have done better without it. 
Character (8/10):
The main characters of Steins;Gate are mostly interesting and some of them have motivations unique to the entire anime medium itself. Okabe is a charmingly awkward self-proclaimed ""mad scientist"" who works extremely well as the main character. The show always ensures that we root for his success. Mayuri is adorable and innocent but not to the point that she's annoying. Kurisu is a strong independent woman who, unlike most anime females, she isn't the sexy slut with giant breasts for the main character to fawn over, she's an actual human being who seems like a realistic university nerd. However, I thought that Faris, the girl who lost her dad, or Ruka, the ""too pure for this earth"" cinnamon bun, both were very irrelevant to the story and didn't develop beyond where they started as characters. The most uninteresting character, however, was Okabe's geek bestfriend Itaru, who was a shallow stereotype of the perverted fat dude. It would've given the show more depth to have tried to develop Faris, Ruka, Itaru or maybe even Suzuha better.
Enjoyment (10/10):
I particularly found the first ten episodes very enjoyable as a typical slice-of-life comedy with a sci-fi twist. The comedy always worked in both the Japanese and English dubs (although you shouldn't miss the ""mad scientist"" scene), and the lighthearted tone in the beginning really set you up for the rollercoaster than the show had in store. Steins;Gate abruptly becomes a disturbingly dark show in its second act, and the despair that the main character trudges through really made the ending pay off a lot better than it would've. Overall, this show is truly one of the best anime of modern times I've seen so far and I would've give a glowing recommendation for everyone looking for a great anime to watch.",9

                ‚ÄúIt has been said that something as small as the flutter of a butterfly‚Äôs wing can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world.‚Äù ‚ÄìChaos Theory
There‚Äôs something about this show that made me go ‚Äúhmm‚Ä¶.‚Äù Perhaps it‚Äôs the concept that time travel, although very popular and becoming slowly overused, and the fact it can make the brain think even more, that made is so irresistible. Physicists have studied it for centuries, trying to figure out every possible detail about its mysteries and about how to control it, its weakness, and what is the difference between reality and imaginary. Take several  other popular cultural, such
                  as Doctor Who, The Butterfly Effect, and heck, even Inception has the reality/imaginary line of Time in it, and try and solve the ways of a paradox or a dream in that matter. The answer‚Ä¶.? 
‚Ä¶.there isn‚Äôt one. 
Story: 10/10
A reason why this anime/manga is so popular and highly rated in the first place is because of the theme: Time. It‚Äôs a curiosity bug that distributes thoughts and ideas via signal into the brain. We are interested in this subject. We can be from a totally different perspective and find a way to seep into the idea of time. It‚Äôs an interesting topic, I have to agree! Time is now, yesterday, and tomorrow. Time controls our life span and the world around us. But mess with time and karma bits you in the ass. You cannot fight it (aka Fate), and when messed with, the Chaos Theory comes into play bring forth the cause and effect concept. 
So perhaps it is why this anime is so popular because of the idea of the Chaos Theory is popular. Play with time paradoxes and you wind up in the same scenario. It‚Äôs really a pick and choose plot. Or a ‚ÄúChoose your own Adventure‚Äù plot. It twists and turns in different scenarios, playing over and over, ending just the same. It‚Äôs an incredible idea that keeps being used in different ways. Makes our brains think and then make us want more. That‚Äôs why time/time travel/chaos theory is full of suspense, because it‚Äôs too interesting not to know more. 
It‚Äôs a rush of exhilaration. 
The symbolism was greatly used in here too. Of course, one is the butterfly‚Äîthe symbol of the Chaos Theory itself. Although, not seen often except briefly in the OP, it does have the leap of the time paradox and the consequences of it used in the plot, such as the many time leaps. We can see from Okabe‚Äôs dozens and dozens attempts with using these leaps, it all leads to the same ending and same scenario. Time has paths, and whatever these paths take will probably end with the same conclusion: Death. I found the pocket watch as a symbol for Death since it was sort of a trigger for Okabe to get is butt into gear. Death was coming, and no matter what he did, he would not be able to stop it. It was inevitable. Plus the pocket watch could be the symbol for Time as well, since well‚Ä¶it‚Äôs obvious. It was like the sand hourglass running out, or a bomb reaching the number zero, that pocket watch was the climax of his feudal attempts.  
I found the conflict use very well done. Man vs. Time as it states as obvious in the present theme of the story. Time is the antagonist in the story. It may seem, when you watch, that yes there are bad guys incorporated, but we must look at the bigger picture here. The antagonist is first seen in the first episode/ chapter. That is really what writers need to portray. There needs to always be a constant conflict involved when Okabe is trying to get to his goal, and Time is that conflict. It gets in his way either by having it run out or making him have difficult decisions. It‚Äôs clear Time tries to portray a message to him through these different paradoxes, and whether it gets through to him or not, it‚Äôs up to you to find out. 
I loved the setting. Using different scenes of times, almost making us have an idea of being in different worlds throughout this entire series. Plus the fact its set in the modern world and not in some place one hundred years from now with flying cars and robots, makes it even more realistic and easier to understand the normal lives of these people. And the use of emotion mixing perfectly into the setting was so brilliantly used I kept hitting my fist on my pillow with frustration on what kept happening. 
Art: 9/10
The one thing about anime that many people look at is the animation itself. The style of the artist, the way they design the characters and background, the amount of effort put into each and every single scene, and seeing the detail placed into it. We‚Äôre really looking into a person‚Äôs head and seeing what they saw before it was actually created. We see their thoughts, the emotions, and even the amount of time placed into it. 
The one thing that stood out for me was the softness and tone of this style of animation. The light colours blended well with the theme and expression of the anime, making it pop even more. And the way the animation hitched when they did a paradox jump really created an intense moment for the watcher. 
Although the background was beautifully well done, I did find the character style a bit‚Ä¶strange. Yes, they were different in the fact that I think Daru was the first ‚Äòobese‚Äô anime character I‚Äôve seen, but they did have a strange say of drawing the eyes without a pupil. Now I‚Äôm not overly that picky, but I did find it a bit creepy the characters didn‚Äôt possess a pupil. Instead they had some kind of swirling white thing around the iris that look just a little‚Ä¶odd. They also don‚Äôt seem to change their outfits at all, making me question if they have ever washed their clothes. I think the only one who changed clothes was Mayuri, and she only did it about three times. 
Sound: 10/10
With the opening of Kanako Ito‚Äôs Hacking to the Gate, how can you not get hyped for this anime? The OP really just draws everyone in with the show‚Äôs theme, idea, characters, and animation. And, of course, the song itself mixes perfecting into the scenario of this show. The title: Hacking to the Gate, really just tells you more than you need to know what this anime is about. It makes another sci-fi time travel show even more interesting. And for once, it makes you not skip the OP because the song is so addicting and so beautifully written that you just want to download it onto your iPod or mp3 and play it on repeat all day! 
Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve already done it. 
The VA‚Äôs both Japanese and English were just the cherry on top (yes, I watched both). The Japanese voices made the character‚Äôs come to life, using humour and their tones to express the emotions on their faces. It was perfectly done to match every second of what was happening in this anime. The English VAs was different to the point they had J. Michael Tatum as their writer. What he did with Okabe just blew me away. He almost made Okabe more of an interesting and hilarious character by using his ever strong voice and comedic speech. He created a very strong voice into the character and other characters as well when he wrote the script. I think it‚Äôs what made the English more different than the dub was the fact he wasn‚Äôt trying to copy the Japanese at all, he was trying to make it more different and create a whole new TV show all together. I think it brought more fans into the whole series frankly. 
Character: 8/10
Now characters can be super hard to explain in anime because they always seem to carry a distinct stereotypical personality that drives us bananas. Literally. I find that every anime I watch, there is always a stereotypical character existing in the universe. 
One example of a stereotypical character is Daru. The typical hacker/ computer nerd that every mad scientist should have in any sci-fi story. He loves food, video games, technology‚Ä¶sound familiar? Because it has been used so many times over the years it‚Äôs created a stereotypical, clich√© character all publishers would push into the trash if they came face to face with one. As funny and awesome as Daru is, and he‚Äôs an absolute sweetheart and teddy bear, his character is way too much overdone. 
Let‚Äôs go to stoic characters. And these characters might not just mean they are ‚Äòstoic‚Äô as in they don‚Äôt have any emotion, but they have little to no development in the story. I picked out a few in this anime that were clearly a ‚Äòstoic‚Äô type characters. Pretty disappointing. 
One character I can say did in fact impress me and actually became one of my favourites was Hououin Kyouma himself! He is a very well defined dynamic character! As the main character and protagonist in this story is was a joy to watch his character come face to face with all these conflicts and resolve them with a touch of a button. I love his admiration and caring personality for his friends, even though he never shows it. He‚Äôs a mad scientist with a comedic personality! He‚Äôs smart! A go getter! And he‚Äôs pretty good looking too! I actually had no idea this guy was 18 until they said so. He looks so much older than he looks! His ability was somewhat the same as Evan Treborn in The Butterfly Effect. Either way, I love him. 
Enjoyment/Overall: 9/10
The anime is definitely a rush and an adventure to watch. You really have to pay attention to what is going on since Time can really get to you. Look away for a moment and it can be a whole other situation. The Chaos Theory is really looked into in this anime and as joined the many other popular culture that has done so. And from someone who loved The Butterfly Effect (2004), this anime was the perfect thing to watch. Although, I did expect a different ending from the way the plot was being paced, but it still ended pretty solid. However, this anime is not over yet. Steins;Gate 0 is coming, and will probably conclude what the mistake was tampering with time paradoxes. Just trying to fix Time will not fix what Okabe has done, and everything shall come together in the sequel. 
The beginning of the end is coming. 
I give this a 92% on the Chaos Theory scale.",9
"
                I feel so disappointed. I don't understand why this get to be in the TOP 10 at all. Sure, the storyline started good and the character development were superb. I actually enjoyed the first 10 episodes after that everything seemed to plummet. It turned slow and was unbearable to watch. I have to fast forward some parts (like undoing the D-mail for Faris and Ruka). Sigh. I feel like I wasted my time with this. 
The story has 24 episodes. I feel like they could have made it shorter. There's a lot of parts where it feels like hours and hours for them to have
                  a conversation. I was actually excited to watch this at first knowing that this is on the top anime and most popular list. But I was hugely disappointed.
I wish they could have condensed the later episodes and put more emphasis on the time traveling issue or please move on with the story as oppose to having hours of dialogue regarding a character or their feelings. I'm just not impressed.",5
"
                That anime that you watch and is surprised, the calm air of the anime and its grayish colors all in perfect harmony for the plot and the development of the characters, being each character very important for the unfolding of the story, the psychological pressure imposed on the protagonist much well built with each act, the characters very well built, a wonderfully well made story and a ""charismatic"" protagonist in his own way. There is no way to not get emotional with the endings and every detail is very important for the next episodes !!! A wonderful adaptation of the novel !!! In my opinion
                  it was the best anime I've ever seen, being little known maybe, but a MASTERPIECE !!!",10
"
                I know that this review is going to be another non relevant one because there‚Äôs a lot of them praising the show like I‚Äôm going to do. But I actually want to say something about it since I‚Äôve watched it 8 times at the moment and it‚Äôs my all-time favourite work. Sorry for my English and the writing as I‚Äôm going to spit ideas and thoughts I have without having a script of how I‚Äôm going to write it.
I‚Äôll try to not make big spoilers (at least without marking them as spoilers) so it should be safe to read if you‚Äôre interested somehow in reading
                  it having not watched the show. 
Steins;Gate is one of the most praised shows in all time and, in my opinion, this praise is absolutely justified. Time travel stories are really difficult to write and keep reasonably consistent without paradoxes in every step the story tries to make, and Steins;Gate dealing with time travel is fairly outstanding and almost flawless.
PLOT: Build Up and how to finish an anime
First, let‚Äôs talk about of, possibly, the strongest part of this show: it‚Äôs plot. One of the most heard criticism about this show is its slow beginning and I‚Äôve to agree with it but not altogether. Steins;Gate start is reasonably slow and can understandably bore watchers used to more ‚Äústraight-to-the-point‚Äù anime but I think that this start is absolutely necessary to build up all the things necessary to make this show as great as it is. 
MAJOR SPOILERS:
All this confusing, slow start is the basement of all the story. In fact, in Steins;Gate does only happen one thing: Makise Kurisu dies and Okabe saves her conducing to the ‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù timeline. But, of course, it can‚Äôt happen as simple as I write it because the show‚Äôs world is pseudo-realistic. All the build up with the D-Mails prepare this scenario and make it possible to happen if you accept that time machines are possible and it stablishes all the relations between the characters (and most importantly, it establishes why the hell would Okabe try to save Kurisu in the first place).
END OF SPOILERS
The build up is not only necessary but shows how science works: theorize, then try to check your theory‚Äôs validity and, if not, try again. That‚Äôs the way science works and that‚Äôs the way Steins;Gate works. And, to me, that‚Äôs a pretty solid reason to the beginning being the way it is (while I can also understand why some people don‚Äôt like it). Like Kurisu said, 99% of science is boring but (I add this part) the other 1% is fucking awesome!
I'm also adding that the science involved in their explanation of time travel is, with all the fictional things that are obviously involved, reasonable. I really like that fact because it's not out of nowhere, it has an explanation (having in mind the hypothetical and fictional side of time machines) that is reasonably scientific.
And having talked about the build-up, let‚Äôs now talk about the second half: the big ball of ‚Äúwibbily wobbly timey wimey stuff‚Äù and how they build one of the two best plot endings I‚Äôve ever seen. And for doing it I‚Äôve to make CRITICAL SPOILERS:
The explosion of this second part starts at episode 12, whit the Rounders attacking the Lab and killing Mayuri for the first time. At this point the show‚Äôs only purpose (and Okabe‚Äôs) is to undo all the things that were made to save Mayuri (taking advantage of the time travel method they have created). Like you probably know, this leads to Kurisu‚Äôs death and the correspondent dilemma that Okabe has. 
Apart of all the thriller and emotions that one can have watching all the process (I really fucking love chapter 22 and cried to it while watching the show for 8th time), and I have to say it‚Äôs all amazingly well done, the real strong point is how they break the loop and change the dilemma into nothing .Both can be saved, no, both HAVE to be saved. And without breaking the logic of the Universe they‚Äôve build. It‚Äôs just a master move to finish with a happy ending but without needing to break anything. 
I also have to comment the casual romance grown between Kurisu and Okabe. It's natural, understandable and beautiful. It's not the main plot and still is better than nearly any romance I've seen. It's the cherry on the cake of Steins;Gate. It only gives more humanity to the show and why Okabe is doing what is doing to save both Mayuri and Kurisu.
And yes, Reading Steiner is a nearly god-level hability that Okabe has because, yes, he‚Äôs the protagonist. But I don‚Äôt think that this fact should blur the rest of the consistent, entertaining and thrilling story. 
END OF SPOILERS
To finish this section I'll state that of course little inconsistencies are present (because it's a fictional story and can't be absolutely flawless) but I don't think they affect the quality of the show. Not gonna make further discussion because there's a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/steinsgate/comments/4eovbv/is_there_any_actual_plothole/ ) with proper discussion about it. !~
____
CHARACTERS: 2nd strongest (but also probably the weakest) part
The characters on Steins;Gate is a very curious part of the show. I'm gonna talk about each character separetely to state how some of them are incredible and likeable characters and others not so much:
LAB MEMBER 001: Okabe Rintaro: The main protagonist of the series. He guides all the show and it's narrated on his point of view. This character is, probably, the best of the show (personally I like more Kurisu, but Okabe is an outstanding protagonist) and the one with more evolution through it (is the main protagonist so it's not surprsing). SPOILERS AHEAD.
We can see his path from nonsensical mad scientist chuunibyou to sad scientist (the very start of Steins;Gate 0) and the despair he has to go through over and over and over again. We can also see how the aparently self-interested mad scientist is at the end of the day a very good friend always willing to help his friends (aka Lab Members). His evolution is brilliant and I can really empathize with him: his reactions are very human (a little mad, though) and makes him one of the best protagonists ever.
END OF SPOILERS
TUTURU! MAYUSHII DESU: Mayuri Shiina: Mayuri is a usually controversial character. She's warm and kind to everyone and I think that, in general, she's enjoyable. At the beginning she's just the childhood friend of Okabe without much more depth, but (specially in S;G0) she's something more like that. SPOILERS:
Of course, if you have watched S;G she's one of the main plot events in the series. And that's good and bad, because, excluding S;G0, she's not a lot more than that but also has a little development and being the only one that can cheer and make Okabe feel like home, with his hostage.
END OF SPOILERS
SUPAH HACKAH: Itaru Hashida: Not gonna make a lot of comments on him; he is the right arm of Okabe, always helping him with computer-related problems and sometimes being more pervert than I'd like. I like him and his strong friend-caring sense (specially in S;G0, but we are talking about the original series). 
THE ASSISTANT: Makise Kurisu: My personal favorite of the show because of it's tsundere personality and her science-minded view of the world. She also evolves a lot through the show (but following the tsundere path) with all the members, specially, of course, with Okabe. SPOILERS AHED:
She helps him in all the worldlines, trusting him every time he time leaps (sometimes is easier than others) and, somehow, growing closer to him every time they meet in a new worldline. And of course, the cherry on the cake, her romance with Okabe. She's, with Okabe, the best character on the show.
END OF SPOILERS
KYOUMA-NYAN: Ruka and Fayris: Not as important (and in the case of Fayris sometimes annoying) but, specially Ruka, enjoyable. SPOILERS:
About Ruka, I like her trans issue (but not how, for example Okabe, deals with it) and how it portraits how difficult is to be trans nowadays.
END OF SPOILERS
OTHER CHARACTERS (SPOILERS)
~! Mister Braun is a not bad written character (but I have some background from the games), but obviously is difficult to like him (anyway I can understand his way of being). The character I like the less in the original series is Moeka. I don't really have to discuss why because is evident. Well, it's just a manipulable character that kills mayuri over and over again. Fuck her.
END OF SPOILERS
OVERVIEW: I really like the characters on Steins;Gate but it's very influenced by Okabe and Kurisu that are amazing characters. That being said, the whole cast is pretty well written or enjoyable (depending on who we are talking about) and makes this series good. 
____
TECHNICAL ASPECT: Amazing and appealing
The visuals are not nothing outstanding or incredible, but they appeal the tone of the show . Not gonna comment much more about it because I like it and it's appealing. 
The music, instead, is a part that I fucking love:
1. The OP: Hacking to the Gate appeals the show very much and is an actual banger. It sounds technologic (appealing to time travel LOL) and its visuals are completely appealing to the weirdness of time travel. It's confusing, yes, but it appeals the show very much. 
2. The ED: Musically impressing and making its effect very very well at the end of every chapter. Nothing much to say, I love it.
3. The OST: Appealing and absolutely masterpiece. I really like it, and appeals every fucking moment. Themes like Gate of Steiner and Believe Me are  the best shit out there. Can't demand more to a show tbh. 
____
CONCLUSION: Perfect Enjoyment and what I can't express with words 
To conclude this absolutely long and boring review, I'm gonna try to write what I can't express. This show is the best I've seen in my life and if you don't agree there's no problem: it's all about personal taste. What I want to say is that my enjoyment on this show is not a perfect score, is perfect score times perfect score. I've watched it 8 times and still noting some details that I didn't notice on other watches and it's emotional moments hit me every single time I watch it. Emotionally talking this show is perfect imo and I love its main characters. I love it very much. 
Thanks for your time and I hope my review isn't too messy!",10

                Disclaimer: I did not write this review. It's copy pasted. I take no responsibility if you expirience dizzines, nausea or spontaneous combustion as an effect of reading it.
First of all, if you have not seen Steins;Gate yet, I strongly recommend that you stop reading this text, delay any immediate plans that you have such as studying for finals or your grandmother's funeral and go watch Steins;Gate this very instant. All you need to know is it's about a guy who turns his microvawe into a time machine and it's freaking amazing. In fact, I can tell you from reliable sources that it's considered an all-time
                  classic in the year of 2050, along shows like Cowboy Bebop, Fullmetal Alchemist, School Days and Nurse Joy's Naughty Adventure (coming out in 2025).
I have rated every aspect of this anime with a perfect 10 because I honestly feel that every aspect of it deserves a perfect score. The story is absolutely amazing, It is going to keep you on the edge of your seat with trilling twists, it is going to make you laugh with excellent humor. It is even going to make you cry your eyes out if you are a little bi...I mean if you are more emotionally sensitive. The artwork is quite unique and outstanding. The soudtrack is awesome, especially the opening intro. The characters are totally stereotypical (a conspiracy theorist and self proclaimed mad scientist, a fat nerd and self proclaimed super hacker, a hot red tsundere) and yet they feel unique and original and will probably grow on you from the very first episode. The character interaction is masterfully executed and at times quite hilarious (especially between Okabe and Christina).
Now with all the important stuff out of the way, I will now have a bit of a rant about one of the central points of this show - time travel. There are many problems associated with time travels that writers tend to ignore. Let me make an example. Let's say we have a story where a hero uses a time machine to prevent a zombie apocalypse caused by a guy in Russia pirating the second season of Game of Thrones. There are two basic models how this could work: one with a single universe and one with infinite parallel universes. The problem with the first one is that our hero is doomed to fail right from the start because the apocalyptic present that our hero comes from is a result of everything that happened in the past, and that includes any meddling from naughty time travelers. So, not only is our hero certain to fail in his quest; he might even end up being responsible for the disaster. Another problem with the first model is something called the grandfather paradox. Say our hero goes back in time and kills his grandfather, thus causing himself to never be born. But if he was never born then how could he kill his grandfather? There were a few episodes of Futurama involving time travel with this single universe model that were really well done and they even included a hilarious twist on the grandfather paradox. The other model, the one with infinite parallel universes, doesn't have any of the described problems. Our hero can simply travel back in time and create a parallel universe where the disaster never occurs. But note that our hero doesn't really save anyone in this model (except himself). He just escapes from his doomed universe into one where everyone is happy, leaving everyone in the original universe to go be eaten by zombies. Dragonball Z hais an example of this kind of time travel.
So, which model does Steins;Gate adopt? The one with a single universe or the one with many parallel universes? Well, a little bit of both actually. There is a single universe, but multiple timelines and it all works pretty well. As I explained in a wall of text above that you probably skipped, both models have some major problems by themselves, but Steins;Gate avoids those problems by combining those two basic models into a new one. Another thing I like about time travel in Steins;Gate is that it is based on and explained by actual science. I know it's not completely realistic but still, it's great that an actual explanation is given for the mechanics of time travel instead of magic or super complicated future alien technology.
Now, as good as Steins;Gate is (and it's bloody good), I still can't say it is absolutely perfect. There were a few plot points that felt very far-fetched and the rules of time travel sometimes felt like they were adjusted to the plot instead of it being the other way around. Still, I stand by my opinion that Steins;Gate is the closest thing to perfection in existence and that it has to be watched by anyone who likes anime enough that he visited this website and read this entire godawful review.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to mail this to myself 15 minutes into the past,  because I know from first-hand expirience that that fool is just staring into his computer screen and trying to think of what to type into an empty box and I know that he's not going to think of anything.",10

                OMG, This anime, the story itself is INSANE, very well thought out and most off all unique, it relates to real life events - John Titor and gives people the sense of ""What if"" the characters in the story all have an unique motive and and specific function in contributing with the main story, they all relate to each other in a way. Beware though, all animes start out with a boring intro episodes, BUT you must not let that drag you down. This anime is like a rocket ship, the beginning pace is kinda slow but after episode 3, MY GOD, it just keeps
                  on going up up up! 
Trust me This anime is F*&king amazing, I watched Clannad AS, Kanon, Elfen Lied, Suzumiya Haruhi No Yuuutsu, I must say THIS IS THE BEST of ALL OF THEM! 
WATCH IT RIGHT NOW! =D",10
"
                It's only episode 3 at the time I'm writing this, but here goes nothing I suppose...
The concept of time travel is not exactly the most familiar thing to many of us. Most of us realize that going forward isn't wholly impossible; hop into a car or any other vehicle and go for a drive, and when you reach your destination, you've traveled a fraction of a fraction of a second forward in time. It's going back that causes much confusion and creates all the paradoxes and theories related to killing off your grandpa because you just hate him that much (though thought experiments such as
                  the twin paradox still stands for traveling forward in time).
Steins;gate (appropriately named after professor Charles Stein of Stanford University, known for his ""Stein's Paradox"" for estimating averages of unobserved future quantities) does something most other anime titles don't: a seemingly more realistic portrayal of time travel when compared to many of the other science-fiction titles out there that feature time travel. The mood of the artwork is gloomy to fit the 'unnatural' nature the story centers around, and the character design doesn't feel very natural, either, which also matches the mood. The series employs subjects from popular culture and popular conspiracy theories relating to general science/physics and time travel from the past decade.
The development team behind the visual novel stated that the game's concept was 99% based off of science/""science-backed-fiction"" and 1% off of fantasy. Hopefully we won't see this adaptation go the fantasy route. Quite recommended to those that want to watch a science-fiction series that primarily revolves around time travel and to what happens to the characters as a result of their unintended invention of a time machine.",8

                MC is the loser weeb stereotype personified. Considering the current year, SAO is better with its writing (the accident of a show that it is, look it up) 
Steins;Gate may be the most overhyped anime of all time. I'm not sure how to write this out, as I usually manage my expectations and am pleasantly surprised on quality or maybe even slightly disappointed. Maybe this show is just showing its age but it does not hold up to any anime in recent years or even good shows from before its time that deserve much better. I'm gonna be honest, I was crawling to the finish
                  line fueled by the hope it was good.
The characters are extremely shallow. There's nothing else to say, they don't act like normal people and the main character must be a projection for the creator because dear God he is selling the ""mad"" in mad scientist. While your typical mad scientist may operate in moral grey areas or maybe be a little sadistic, they've never been a loser. I don't know how tsundere fell into his lap and why she kept orbiting him either, from what I gather she seems to be a genius at a young age advancing the field of science, yet is so attracted to someone who is so.... revolting? If I met this person I would not want to be their friend is all I'm saying.
Looking back, the setting must have been quite novel to the anime community at least. This show was a welcome break from the other shounen airing at the time I'm assuming. I think the reason this show caught on was its timing. Like SAO, this shit would not fly today.
The pacing is also complete garbage. This could have easily been a 12 episode show and nothing of value would be lost. The reason I don't care about these characters would not be so prevalent if there was a shorter run time and less time to get to know them (and like that kind stranger you met last week, you don't grow to hate them.) I became so uninterested in the story that for the first time I can remember, I didn't want the show to get better. That ending in ERASED sucked right? Most people wanted better. 
Lastly, the colour choice. The colour goes from grey to not-so-grey. Like sure, maybe it has a thematic element, but God it's depressing after a while.
I'm not even sure if this show had potential. I'm not a pro at reviews, so I've taken a few liberties with my format. Apologies. Just needed to vent about this shitty show.
Oh, I think I remember the second season's OP sounding okay. Was there sound in this anime?
3/10 watch the last half ironically while heavily inebriated with friends to poke fun at, but it's certainly no Assassin's Pride. I would like to send a formal inquiry to the UN to investigate that 'CIA mind control experiment'. I'm pretty sure they used it on a few thousand people here. 
Seriously go watch SAO. Vanilla is better than dogshit as far as flavouring goes",3
"
                The first Scientific anime that will get you head-over-hills for its magnetizing lust for time-travel and all that drama that flies along with it.
I will no longer go to the details, because I've watched Steins;Gate a long time ago and because I was so overwhelmed, look who forgot to write a review.
Some trivia:
Huouoyin Kyouma is voiced by the same notorious Yagami Light, but comes with a more mature and full-grown voice. The character Amane is also voiced by TenTen from Naruto. So coming from these famous probably high-paid experienced voice actors, the anime production is already big.
ENJOYMENT - 10/10
The first episode is a no-no. Second
                  one will drive you insane. 
Each episode holds another mystery, another reason to stay. 
Kyouma, alongside the characters that have time-travelled, will have their lives rippled because of the changes that had been granted somewhere in the past. The thing is, in order to save someone important to him, Kyouma must go back to these past events to change the future.
Kind of a nerve-rackling issue, but hey, that what makes this anime BADASS.
STORY - 10/10
The only time-travel anime, aside from 'Erased' that I'll probs give a damn of. The story is packed with characters that, in the beginning, will look like losers and have no potential...but as someone from the future passed by and told the tale, Okabe and Itaru were actually the godly inventors of the TIME MACHINE, which that person used to go back in time. 
The creator of the story has an awesome mind. To start with the word ""world lines"" and compel the world to think that the universe doesn't actually JUST consist of the past, present and the future, but more like an expanding chains of what happened here, who gets killed there, what exists in this place. There's also a 'butterfly effect' that is explained neatly. 
It also teaches that some pasts, are not decided for but can be let go of--in other words, accepted--in order to be free HAPPY. Free.
To reach euphoria, one must go through sadness to learn that those things are actually inviolable, that reality is reality; if it's meant to be, it is probably for a great cause. 
Basta (Filipino term for 'Whatever'), I will forever ship Okabe x Kurisu. 
SOUND - 7/10
Disappointed because only ONE OST got into my head, and that was 'Believe Me', which was a theme song for Mayuri. It's sad. 
CHARACTER - 10/10 
Have you seen the drawings?? I've only noticed it when I talked to a friend. And yes, they really are like people. I thought Mayuri was going to be annoying, she had that Hinata vibe tbh, but it turns out most of 'em have good stories to share. 
OVERALL - 10/10
Perfect for its unique craft. Unique, unique, unique--it's one word but it gives meaning and justice because it is distinguishable, it has its OWN; it's not like any other. 
The story is challenging and is a risk-taker: it deals with Sci-fi, a heavy burden on the shoulder to take on, but is able to cover for all its time-travel questions.
The story has a strong protagonist, that is expected of all anime--he is crazed, insane, but he has GUTS. He has an initiative. His laugh is irredeemable. 
Okabe Rintarou is one hell of a mad scientist. 
On top of it all, the story has a happy ending which all can sleep peacefully. Let's be honest: all anime have bad ones, for some strange still-unscouted reason. 
I highly recommend this to people in general. No personality/genre-looking shits must-have. Just watch it, if you dare. 
Steins;Gate started with an EPIC--it ended with one.",10
"
                I do not understand time-space and it's paradoxes. I didn't need to for this show, it made sure to explain what other shows let slide as technobabble. I don't know if anything in this show was possible, or realistic, yet I didn't care. It was a ride where we watch outstanding tragedy occur, wholesome feelings of intimacy, and science. There were laughs, and they felt natural. Nothing in this show screamed filler, every episode had a purpose, and everything brought up has a point. 
I was quite pleased to see subtlety used so well in this show. I can be near the end of the
                  series and shout at 3:00 am that ""Hey I remember that!"" while watching a late episode, while only realizing I had seen the first not but the previous day afternoon. Man, it was worth the binge-watch and the sleepless night. 
The story for me gets a 9 of 10. We watch a character act a character in a comedic way whilst he just does what he think is right. Hard personalities can be soft, and the dim can be bright after-all. I can't be happier with the way things turned out, even at times I became stressed at the several climaxes were exposed to. 
Art and Sound get a 7, average. This is my third anime show and I didn't get a headache and I never thought it was amazing either. I guess that is good enough for me.  
Characters were fun. Solid 10. We get a pickem' mix of awkward, funny, sad, stoic, kind. Whatever you decide you can attribute to a real personality of a real person was found in this anime. Sometimes I felt like they were linear, but then you can be proved wrong immediately after these thoughts. 
I enjoyed every episode of this series. 10, that's about it. I can re-watch it, too. Someday. I might find even more subtle, funny differences in another view. It was a clever, intriguing take on a time driven plot with sci-fi related moods and mystery. 
This show gets 9 time leaps of 10.",9

                Full disclosure, if you're reading this review in the hope of getting an objective critique of Steins;Gate, you're probably going to be disappointed. As it stands, Steins;Gate is probably my favorite series, and I cannot in good conscience allow you to believe that this is going to be anything other than me completely gushing over everything about the show. So, if that's not your thing, thanks for stopping by, and maybe we can talk again some other time. But if you're willing to listen to me ramble about why I think Steins;Gate is an absolute masterpiece, and why I think you should watch it too,
                  then stick around, you might have a good time.
""People's feelings are memories that transcend time."" - Makise Kurisu 
Story 10/10:
Steins;Gate has garnered a reputation from some people for having a complex story that can often be very hard to follow. On the surface, I suppose that could be true. It's got pseudo-scientific terms being thrown around all over the place, time travel, parallel dimensions, all the ingredients you need for a show that will make your brain hurt. However, and take this with a grain of salt as I am not overly familiar with time travel fiction, I believe that Steins;Gate handles the time travel elements better than anything else I have seen across any fictional medium. Many of the plot points that permeate time travel fiction (time loops, changing the past to change the future, etc..) are found within Steins;Gate, and they are handled masterfully. What you get when you have a show that handles it's core conceit so well is a show that allows you to look past what it is about on the surface, and look into what the story is really about: the characters (but more on them later.) 
In short, if none of that made any sense, the story of Steins;Gate wears a veil of pseudo-scientific complexity, one that falls away after a few episodes, and allows the viewer to see the face of the real story, that of the characters. And when you get to that, Steins;Gate becomes a mesmerizing tale of the bonds between people, and how far along the fabric of space and time those bonds can go before they break.
Art 10/10:
The art and animation in Steins;Gate is, simply put, simple. This is a not a show with over-the-top visual effects and fight scenes taking place every episode. Everything about the art style is subdued; the show utilizes a fairly muted color palette a lot of the time, and focuses on mundane looking characters going about their business in mundane locations, although both the locations and characters and drawn and animated beautifully. Often the show will linger on locations, characters, and simple small details for longer than would seem necessary, but it all feeds into the aesthetic nature of the show, which I would call contemplative. Steins;Gate is a thought provoking series, and by using the art and animation to give the viewer time to breath and take in everything that is going on, the show allows the viewer to fully experience the emotional weight of what they are watching.
Sound 10/10:
Much like the art of Steins;Gate, the ambient sound and music of the show exists primarily to further its aesthetically contemplative nature, and it does so very well. The sounds of Tokyo's pedestrian and vehicular traffic, crickets chirping, cicadas buzzing, it all plays into making the world of the show feel real, while also taking up a lot of the dead space when there is no dialogue, keeping the viewer engaged and their thoughts provoked. Additionally, the Opening and Ending songs are both fantastic, among my absolute favorites. They both took awhile to grow beyond being decent, but by the end of the series I looked forward to both of them every time.
The voice acting in both the subbed version and the dubbed version is stellar. The casts of both do an amazing job of bringing the characters and the story to life. Personally I prefer the subbed version, the main reason being that Miyano Mamoru does a masterful job conveying the nuances and eccentricities of the main character, Okabe Rintarou. J. Michael Tatum does a fantastic job as well in the dub, but his mad scientist laugh is just not quite as satisfying.
Characters 10/10:
This is the big one. I've realized over the years that no matter what medium I'm experiencing, the most important thing to me when it comes to enjoying a story is the characters. The cast of Steins;Gate is not that large, with their only being around 9 major characters, but every one of them steals the show at one point or another. As I said in my discussion of the story, the real heart of Steins;Gate is the characters, and all of them are highly enjoyable to watch every time they are on the screen. Okabe Rintarou stands as my favorite anime protagonist, largely because he is so fun to watch. He is amazingly nuanced, much like the show itself, in that they both initially present a false face, in the case of Okabe that of mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, and the show as a tale about science and time travel, but eventually the walls are broken down to reveal that Okabe is actually much less irreverent than he first appears to be, and the show is much more about characters and their relationships than anything else. 
The other characters are all fantastic for their own reasons, and are just as dynamic as Okabe. They all get their moments to shine in the story, and by the end I found myself caring deeply about all of them.
Enjoyment 10/10:
All you really need to know is that I watched the entire series in less than 24 hours, and then went back and watched the whole thing again over the following week. And I regret none of it.
Overall 10/10;
Watching Steins;Gate is an experience that I don't think I will ever match again when watching anime. The story, the art and sound, and especially the characters combine to create a masterfully told story about how far people are willing to go for the people that they care about.  It can be heavy and slow at sometimes, but if you're anything like me, it's worth it in the best way possible. I recommend it to anyone who loves intelligent, character driven stories that take a few twists and turns along the way, and wants to experience something that will take them on an emotional roller-coaster.

"
                College student Okabe Rintaru (alias Hououin Kyouma and voiced by my favorite seiyuu Mamoru Miyano, whose brilliant performance carries the show) is a self-styled mad scientist running a lab out of his apartment. One day, he and his friends realize that they have accidentally created a time machine out of their microwave by turning bananas into green goop.
While at first, this series is fun and silly, as it progresses and the butterfly-effect consequences start stacking up, it gets very dark indeed, with shady organizations and murder and PTSD.
By the end, I loved all the characters, and each has surprising depth and talents: Okabe the increasingly
                  conflicted protagonist, Mayuri (the innocent cosplaying heart of the series), Daru the super-hacker, Kurisu the girl genius, Ruka who wishes he were born a girl, Suzu the part-timer who works downstairs, Moeka who only talks through texts, Feyris the cat-lady, Mr. Braun the landlord, and Nae (his daughter). Somehow the folks working on the particle collider at SERN are the bad guys.
But no matter how convoluted or intense the plot gets when they mess with different timelines, the focus is always on the characters‚Äô relationships, and it will eventually become clear that it features one of the best love stories in anime ever.

                Upon seeing the ratings of Steins; Gate on MAL, I expected it to be a very good anime. Starting the first few episodes of it, I was left rather confused and disappointed. Sure it was good, but not as great as the ratings given.
However, as I progressed around 5 episodes of it, this anime starts picking up its pace with a sense of excitement and explanation of time-travelling. It doesn't stop there. The best part is definitely the second half of the show, where it starts to get really interesting. Steins; Gate is definitely worth watching from start till end.
The story is the best part
                  of the anime; it starts off simple but takes a dive into a deep story filled with suspense, excitement, surprise, anticipation and anxiety, once everything is set for it. Upon completing Steins; Gate, I understood why the ratings were so high and deservedly so.",8
"
                I mostly watch comedy and especially the harem and ecchi kind. A friend told me to watch this one and after looking some things up I noticed it was based on a visual novel so I decided to watch it.
I was surprised to see that the storyline was actually that of a mystery/ sci fi series (and there were no really cute girls with which the main character probably would hook up with since he's a complete idiot when it comes to that). Nevertheless I loved it.
The pace at which things develop is fast and there is never a moment where I wasn't speculating along
                  with the characters to solve the big mystery that is time travel. I actually cried when that one thing happened which I don't want to spoil because the impact of it on the story is too great to simply burst out in two words (which is possible). 
The art is great, story is epic and the complete random things the main character says are way too awesome to just let pass. Definitely one to watch!

                Steins;Gate is the first anime that did time travel right, not just as a plot mechanism, but as the plot itself. That alone is very admirable.
Story: 
Steins;Gate does story very well, it gives off a slice of life vibe early on, but it transitions as the plot unfolds and breaks the mold of the mundane Slice of Life genre. The romantic subplots are handled well and never take over the plot itself, it all seems natural and lifelike (if we had time travel of course)
10/10
Art:
The art of Steins;Gate is clean looking, and modern. The environments are detailed and all look realistic. Characters are well designed
                  and the girls are not all fanservice. The only gripe I have is that the side profile faces can look a bit odd in some scenes.
8/10
Sound:
Great musical score, and a fantastic opening song. The sub and dub are both great, but I would recommend the dub, just for Okabe's voice actor, who is absolutely fantastic and nails the role. I had no gripes about the sound at all.
9/10
Enjoyment:
I rank enjoyment based on the genre, since I can enjoy different genres in different ways. Since Steins;Gate is a mature drama I mainly rate it on emotions that I was subjected to during the show. I laughed, was scared, worried, and even cried multiple times in the closing episodes. This show is a roller-coaster that lives up to the genre of drama.

                At first, afte reading the plot summary, I was against watching it. Why? I was more of an action-type weeb who wanted material like that in Akame ga Kill and FMAB. It looked to me like a more serious, slow-going anime about time travel, with no fantasy elements besides the futuristic. But after seeing it on so many top 5 lists, I acquiesced and tried it out.
Brilliant. Just brilliant. White Fox outdid itself. The character of Okabe Rintarou is brilliant. I loved his witty Nordic operation names and the way he carried himself, his pompous scientific persona. Lab Members are aptly introduced, each an individual
                  superbly done. Of all the stories with time travel, whether in books, films, or otherwise, this is the best I've seen so far. Anime you really can't know it's superb or good until after trying it out. If you're one of those anti-weebs like the former me, then you've probably never heard of Steins;Gate, and its brilliance.
White Fox is one of my favorite studios. The characters, the murky grey tones, the fuzzy time-affected swirls, the deep red of Makise's hair, Okabe's persona, the characters, their emotions and personalities manifested. Not too many bright colors, not like anime like Fairy Tail or Code Geass. The setting is drawn very appropriately, colored aptly, lighted perfectly. Cinematography is excellent, one of the best I've seen besides that of Tokyo Ghoul, which has no equal in my list.
The sound, the gentle piano, punctuates the emotive context of Steins;Gate very well also. Not a very majestic OST like that of FMAB or Code Geass, but certainly memorable.
Character. You have the hilarious Okabe who I already mentioned. The intelligent and aloof Kurisu Makise, a superb opposing player to Okabe. Shiina Mayuri, the cute, childish and fairy-like assistant to Okabe. And more Lab Members that I'll leave you to see for yourself. Each character is distinct, and unforgettable. Voice acting, excellent.
Steins;Gate does begin somewhat slowly, but like a roller coaster (pardon me for the overly used comparison), it accelerates to the point where you have to see what happens next. Awesome ending, just awesome. There is a reason -- iie, there are many reasons why this anime is ranked third on all of MyAnimeList. If you want to think, wonder, and smile to yourself for finding such a great anime, then open Steins;Gate.
one word to describe this anime: brilliant",10
"
                I would like to start by being upfront about my feelings on this series. The first six or so episodes are a true slowburn with a lot of important details scattered about, but this information will not be quite as relevant to you as an audience member until you've reached the point in which everything shifts into proper perspective.
There is truly a reason Steins;Gate is so highly rated. The writing is never cheap and every moment of this anime serves a purpose to either address earlier oddities or questions the audience may have had, or to keep in mind for when the big reveal or
                  crazy plot twist catches you off guard.
The character development in this series is phenomenal, which each character receiving a realistic approach to who they are and how they became the way they are. The most fascinating of all is definitely the MC, who with as little spoilers as possible seems to develop as a character in a very inverse way to your normal main protagonist.
The bond between Kurisu and Okabe really amazed me. There was something almost timeless, excuse the unintended pun, about the way their friendship develops and how deeply they are shown to care for each other as the story progresses.
My favorite scene, and quite possibly one of the most chilling scenes I have ever experienced in anime, is around the 21:30 mark of Episode 20. As not to give away spoilers, this scene hits like a truck even if in the back of your mind you knew it was coming.",10

                Okay. You might be thinking this anime is all about time travelling and escaping from SERN, but no. You are wrong. You might also be thinking this anime is just about sci-fi and thrillers, wrong too. For people that only watches animes that consists of romance and comedy, you guys should actually watch this too. 
Story: 10/10
This anime is about a guy named Rintarou Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist that goes by the alias ""Hououin Kyouma,"" as he essentially plays around with time and subsequently deals with the consequences of his selfish acts. There are 24 episodes in this series. The 1st episode is gonna
                  confuse u, no one will ever understand when they first started watching. From episode 1 to 11, this anime just looks like a typical romantic comedy anime. Right when episode 12 starts, thats where all the problems start to occur. The thrilling sensation, it never ends till the last episode. The writer is just amazing, able to write a story of Steins;Gate without messing up the story halfway. So for the story, this anime has the best storyline Ive ever seen.
Art: 9/10
Im giving it a 9 out of 10 because its not to say extremely good, and not average. Its between Perfect and Average. Theres no problem at all with the animation.
Sound: 9/10
Now for the sound. First is the opening song and the closing song, they are both really creative and the song is great. The songs matches the anime. Next is the soundtracks, its great. Its really well composed. Lastly, the voices. Damn, iim speechless, especially for Okabe seiyuu, he really is talented, laughing exactly like a mad scientist, and his voice made the joke seems even funnier. I lost count of how many times I laughed in this anime. And whenever Okabe gets serious or sad, the seiyuu sure is also talented for that. Not only Okabe has got a good seiyuu, almost everyone does! Kurisu has got a good tsundere voice actress, Mayuri too! Tuturuu~
 Character: 10/10
The characters are outstanding indeed. Their personalities. Almost all of the characters are my favourite. Meaning they all hv good characters :)
Enjoyment: 10/10
I have already lost count of how many times I laughed. Not only laugh, but there are also sad parts, although I didnt cry but I could feel the sorrow in my heart. I finished this anime in 1 day. Meaning I enjoyed this anime to the max. I never got tired or bored.
Overall: 10/10
Best anime I have ever watched. Im hoping there would be a new sequel to this anime because I am missing it so muchhh. So for those who have not watch it yet, u must really watch this.

                Steins;Gate,
All i can think of is how much of an amazing anime this is :P.
There are so many good things about this anime. Things i will talk about will be the lessons it teaches and some other things ill tell you later. First in this show you will go through many emotions of sadness, happiness, love, and confusion. But, don't worry everything makes complete sense in the end. Now, in this show there will be death, so much death in fact that(well this happened to me) you will not feel sad after a certain amount of times. Things can also get confusing through out the
                  anime. Some things aren't explained well yet some things are explained completely(but again it all adds up in the end). Keep reading :)...
Story:
The story, I would say, is freaking crazy. Your brain is all over the place as you watch. The story not only is good but is put together perfectly to give you an experience that you can trust will be mind blowing :P. Lastly what makes it good is that it is unique, and has many(i guess) unique(in a good way) ideas.
Art:
The art is so-so. Not many animes have this kind of art(at least animes that ive seen) but it is still good. I am not going to talk to much about the art. I guess all i can say is it is unique art but still good enough to keep you happy.
Characters:
There is a decent variety of characters. Types are, mad scientist, smart girl, good-innocent girl, otaku guy, and some others that if i say too much will spoil. Overall the characters fit the anime well and are good at giving you the experience you would want.
Anyways, back to what i was talking about in the beginning. There are many lessons that you will learn in this anime. You will learn how ""without bad or sadness, there is no good or happiness"" and that in ""time traveling"" the more you try to change the past the worse the future gets. There are some more that are nice but  not as important.
Well...
Tha'ts mostly what i can think of and basically it is worth watching it's really entertaining and is fun to watch.
Hope this helped. Thanks.",10

                And here we go. The universe has a beginning.
Steins;Gate. This is the anime adaptation of the visual novel of the same name. It is also the sequel to Chaos;Head. It will confuse you. It will bombard you with SCIENCE and 2ch memes. It will amaze you.
Let‚Äôs get on with it shall we?
I will not be comparing this to it‚Äôs visual novel form. Let me make that clear.
Okay, episode one.
Story: Take LOST, add 50 cups Donnie Darko, a teaspoon of Inception, and a fuckload of primer. Naturally, you‚Äôd get Steins;Gate.
The story here is about a scientist (self proclaimed MADDO SCIENTISTU), Okabe Rintarou, who is constantly worried
                  that he is being tracked by the ‚ÄúOrganization‚Äù. The way he sees it, they are after his technology. I mean, who wouldn‚Äôt want a microwave that teleports bannanas so far forward they turn to jelly? Right? Right. Oh, and time traveling texts and people not really dead...yet (spoiler? you'll find out!)
Then you have Shiina Mayuri. She is the shows‚Ä¶moe girl ditz character. She makes cosplay.
And Itaru. The nerd hacker 2ch fat guy.
And Chris. The girl who dies but then doesn‚Äôt die. Wait what? Also, super smart.
Yes, Steins;Gate, so far, is a cluster of ‚Äòwait what?‚Äô. This episode‚Äôs main plot points are the satellite that has fallen on the roof of the building where Okabe was attending a meeting by a guy claiming to have a formula for time travel when really, he just Copy-pasta‚Äôd the John Titor story onto a paper and made it Japanese. Spoilers the satellite is a time machine. Then, you find out that Chris has been murdered. But then, she isn‚Äôt murdered. OH SHIT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? Then you have the time travel microwave oven and time traveling texts. Yes. This is like LOST without the constant smoke monster attacks and characters appearing everywhere. I don‚Äôt want to talk too much about the story, because that would mean I have to spend more time typing in this category, which isn‚Äôt my favorite category. It‚Äôs a great first episode, really sets up what is to come. And there is a shitton to come.
Artwork: What can I say? White Fox, you are now in the  list of my favorite animation studios. The art is clean and vivid. Also, they make Jelly Bananas look yummy.
Music: That theme. Gate of Steiner is the theme that plays at the end of the episode. It‚Äôs a great theme. I am fucking glad that they kept the original soundtrack.",10
"
                Story: Everything was pretty great, except for one part i feel could have been done better but whatever. Not much i can say that hasn't already been said. In fact this review will probably end up being useless but whatever. Int he end the story gets a 9/10
Art: Whitefox lol what more can i say? - 10/10
Sound: As good as everything else - 10/10
Character: Novels usually have pretty good characters and this is no exception -  10/10
Enjoyment: only some hardcore elitist who watches nothing but shit all day would hate this, if anything this show may be to elite for even them. - 10/10
Overall:
                  lol if it wasn't obvious - 10/10",10

                Have you ever wondered what would happen to a banana if it were placed in a time travelling microwave? Neither have I, but Steins;Gate plays with this arbitrary idea along with a few other alluring what-ifs on the subject of time travel. Based on the visual novel of the same name, this 24-episode television adaptation is something of a science-fiction thriller topped with a welcome quantity of humour ‚Äì as it‚Äôs come to be expected in most anime series nowadays. It comes as an odd realisation that an industry as creative and inventive as the one of Japanese animation would have such few attempts at
                  delving in the ever puzzling and intriguing topic of time manipulation to showcase for. Sure, plenty of series have toyed with the theme in one way or another, and the recent The Girl Who Leapt Through Time made exemplary use of the concept in what turned out to be an appropriately casual but memorable feature length piece, but most would-be examples preferred to cast time travel off in the supporting role rather than making it the star of the show.
In Steins;Gate, however, time travel makes for the quintessential leading man. It‚Äôs as much of a character in the story as our accidental heroes: a group of individuals with colliding personalities gathered together by Okabe Rintarou (although he would prefer to be called Hououin Kyouma), a self-professed ‚Äòmad scientist‚Äô who‚Äôs always on the lookout to increase the budget of his small apartment laboratory and come up with new and strangely-named ‚Äòfuture gadgets‚Äô ‚Äì as he refers to them. Okabe‚Äôs bunch is a scarce one at first, made up entirely of him, the slightly chubby and not so slightly sexually perverted Daru, and lovable airhead Shiina Mayuri. Daru handles all things related to computer tech, Mayuri provides light entertainment and some funds when the laboratory demands so, and Okabe strolls around entranced in his countless conspiracy theories (much to our amusement).
Things start off with Okabe witnessing the murder of a talented young researcher by the name of Makise Kurisu while attending a conference on time travel. His sending of a text message regarding the incident to lab partner Daru triggers a change in the recent past, causing among other things the deceased Makise to be alive and well, much to Okabe‚Äôs astonishment. Once the crew realise that the microwave gadget in the lab is capable of time travel, they start experimenting with it, discovering more and more details of this bizarre phenomenon as time goes on ‚Äì or rather backwards in this case.
There‚Äôs a fine story at play here, and the dynamic between the various characters ‚Äì superior to that in most other shows in recent years ‚Äì makes for engaging episodes. As with pretty much every other piece of fiction on the subject of time travel, suspension of belief is more or less required if one is to follow the story without screaming for plot holes every five minutes, but Steins;Gate is remarkably watertight in that respect (as watertight as time travel can get anyway). The adventures of Okabe and co. are plausible enough so as not to warrant any confusion or unnecessary scepticism on the viewer‚Äôs part, and time travel is portrayed in a relatively logical and easily understandable fashion.
Getting back to the characters Steins;Gate boasts an ensemble that rises above the copy and paste of a considerably large amount of today‚Äôs anime series. Surprisingly enough, what gives Steins;Gate this advantage is not the fact that the characters here are unique or anything of the kind, but rather that the characters contain a certain something that sets them apart from the prototype. Okabe undoubtedly shares the traits of the model protagonist, being the most important and crucial piece in the narrative chess game, but he‚Äôs oddly enough also used as the primary comic relief of the show. Now, there‚Äôs a dangerous line one is walking when deciding to blend hero and jester in a single mix, and often the consequences of not playing the card right far outweigh the benefits of getting the ace in the hole, but the dramatis persona of Okabe is done so well ‚Äì whether by intention or pure accident ‚Äì that in a couple of years, prompted by the kick-in of nostalgia, people will be looking back and saying: ‚ÄòNow that was a good leading character.‚Äô
It‚Äôs not merely Okabe that stands out in this manner, though, but the rest of the bunch as well. Mayuri‚Äôs kawaii adequately represents the calm before the storm, contrasting the ‚Äòdarker‚Äô turn of events that comes to fruition later on in the narrative journey ‚Äì during which the character is also given a neat little twist which loosens up her cardboard shackles. Daru remains pretty constant throughout, though his lewd ways generate some delightfully amusing moments thanks to the clever dialogue, and latter developments in the plot push him towards three-dimensionality and consequently help him keep up with the rest of the band (insert weight joke here). Then there‚Äôs Makise Kurisu: a tsundere by all accounts of the definition, but far more tolerable in that regard than most of her kinsfolk, and quite a competent love interest as well. The romance subplot involving the relationship between her and Okabe never gets in the way of the main narrative but it never drifts off to the side either; in other words, it is thoroughly well-done and appropriately sweet.
There‚Äôs a reason for mentioning the turn of events in the previous paragraph. Despite its seemingly cheerful nature, Steins;Gate is not entirely untainted by a figurative dark side. In fact, the tone alters a good deal throughout its telling of the story, and hints of this change of heart are given as early on as the very first episode. However, whether this transformation causes an occurrence of welcome balance or displeasing distortion in the temper of the series or whether it hits or misses its targeted purpose is more up to the individual viewer to decide rather than being the task of a unanimous collective.
Unlike its impressive storyline or its striking characters, Steins;Gate isn‚Äôt particularly distinctive in terms of its visual aesthetics. Aside from some noteworthy character design ‚Äì especially noticeable in the various and creative close-ups of Okabe ‚Äì and an interesting choice of colour palette, there‚Äôs little to distinguish the series from today‚Äôs model of shows. It‚Äôs basically a template dipped ‚Äì moderately, not entirely ‚Äì in a bucket of neutral colours. In other words, Steins;Gate shows a clear affinity for patterns of white, gray, and black, which is ultimately the only thing that gives the show somewhat of a visual signature. One of the greatest weaknesses is found behind the curtain, in the background and scenery department. While the imagery works well enough in interior locations such as the laboratory, there are a few stumbles when it comes to the outsides.
The title sequence encapsulates the essence of the series rather well, delivering an eye-catching journey themed around time and all its musings. All the while Itou Kanako‚Äôs ‚ÄòHacking to the Gate‚Äô plays in the background ‚Äì a resounding tune fuelled by a powerful chorus that empowers the rapidly shifting images on the screen. The closing credits aren‚Äôt as stirring, but the concluding piano track is effective enough to provide a gratifying final touch to each episode.
Steins;Gate may not be the be-all and end-all of anime time travelling, but it‚Äôs certainly an above average exercise in more than one respect. Benefitting from all-around superior writing and a smoothly told story with characters that draw in, drama that manages to capture, and comedy that produces laughter and grins, it‚Äôs hard to consider the series as anything other than a success. It‚Äôs safe to say that no one will want to go back in time and warn their past selves to avoid this show after giving it run through.",8

                The following review is brought to you by Dr. Pepper, an intellectual drink for the chosen ones.
The subject of time travel is a popular one in media. Each platform has it's own go-to title. In film, it's ""Back to the Future"". In television, it's ""Doctor Who"". And in Anime, it's ""Steins;Gate"". A series from White Fox that earns it's rightful place along side those household titles by providing one of the most intelligent, beautiful, exciting, and above all best shows of the decade. 
When ever you cover the subject of time travel, the word used the most is complicated. Most people don't want to go
                  near the subject because they think it's gonna be way over their head or they shall be bored to death by it. Fear not! ""Steins;Gate"" has a plot that makes things easy enough to grasp for the average viewer and moves along a slow, steady pace- almost to a fault. I was dazzled by the gorgeous (and at times surreal) artwork on display. The Summer looks hot. The cheap apartment feels dingy. It's all so perfect. The CG effects and sound used in conjunction with this art are used only when necessary and to great effect. It makes this show not just a feast for the mind, but for the eyes and ears as well.
Through the first 12 episodes I was made to feel curious and settled into the slowly unfolding plot that was in front of me. I was introduced to great characters, our MC and self-proclaimed ""Mad Scientist"" Rintarou Okabe, who prefers the alias ""Hououin Kyouma"", who acts as eccentric as the name would sound with a laugh that matches. Daru, the fat hacker with a porn addiction. Mayuri, the simple, sweet, and at times annoying, moral support girl. And Kurisu Makise, the tsundere. The show even points out she is a tsundere. Together they, and an equally strong group of side-characters, make up one of the best casts I've seen in years. They are all used well in the plot and get flushed out over time. Back to that plot...
The first dozen episodes can feel like a chore to get through. I felt like I was sitting through a scientific sit-com. It almost became formulaic. Oh, boy! This episode Okabe is gonna do something WACKY and somewhat science-y and Daru is gonna act all perverted. Then Kurisu is gonna get mad and point out something that advances the plot all while Mayuri goes, ""Too-too-roo!"" and a few instances of time travel will occur. Then we hit the halfway point... then things accelerate in hurry, going from zero to 88 miles per hour before you can say, ""GREAT SCOTT!""
The last 12 episodes may be the most binge-worthy in the history of Anime. A fast-paced, exciting journey to the end game, all of it fitting perfectly with the first 12 episodes leaving you with a full experience that is something like that of a Christopher Nolan feature. Heads up: pay attention to those first 12 episodes. The life of a time traveler doesn't always happen in the correct order. Just trust me and enjoy the ride. It's intense. 
Now, here comes the Sub vs. Dub argument. There is none. This is not me saying that J. Michael Tatum isn't any good as the MC, I think he does a great job along with the rest of the English cast. This show MUST be watched in Japanese or else plot points and jokes will be lost. That, and you will miss out on the fantastic performance by the great Miyano Mamoru, who delivers the best performance of his career as Rintarou Okabe. He truly is the heart of show.
If I could time travel, I would probably tell myself to watch this show sooner and not to write this review. This show has been reviewed to death already and this one will probably be the equivalent of shedding a tear in the Pacific Ocean, but if you're reading this- you have to watch ""Steins;Gate"" right now. It is an all-time great Anime and one of the best television shows in recent memory and is worth your time. So grab a Dr. Pepper and enjoy. You'll thank me in the future. 10/10. Total masterpiece. Check it out. Cheers- oh, what the heck? Too-too-roo!",10

                This anime is a masterpiece, the plot is perfect, the rythm just fine. I was a bit scared about the characters, but they turned out to be really well written, and each of them, by their dreams, are representing concepts that are really interesting. The time concept explained, though fictional, is rich of symbols.
The quality of the animation is also very good, the only thing I could complain about was the music, not that it's bad, I just think it could have been much better. But the overall sound effects of the anime are well done.
I highly recommend this anime if you havent given a
                  try to it yet.
And sorry for english mistakes.

                I'm sorry if this sounds a bit fangirlish. I am a serious person I swear, but, this is the best anime I've ever seen, EVER. I know I rate kinda high, but, I'm probably going to rerate everything I've ever watched so this would look better by composition. If anime shows were gods I'd worship Steins;Gate. -.- No joke. It's so complex, thrilling, and touching. Plus, it kicks your emotions around like a hacky sack (but, I actually see that as a good thing ^^;). Anywho, it's the best show in the world, everyone should watch this show. EVERYONE. I might even make my mom
                  watch it, but, if she doesn't like the show it would break my heart, so, I don't know about that....",10

                [CONTAINS SPOILERS]
There is one word I can think of when summarizing Steins Gate: TERRIBLE. This is easily the worst and dumbest anime I have ever seen in my life. It tries to be fake deep, fake smart, stupid asspulls, and is a complete failure in every aspect. Starting with the story, the story is bland as fuck. The first episode starts off somewhat interesting and leaves you thinking there is going to be some huge twist. However, for the next 12 episodes, NOTHING and I mean NOTHING interesting happens. It is an absolute snooze fest and I could not stay awake. After the boring episodes
                  you think it'll start to get interesting when a certain death happens. However, after that it goes back to being a complete snooze fest with dumb plot contrivances. The dialogue is boring, the animation is terrible for its time, and none of the soundtracks are memorable. The worst part of this show however is the characters. The main character is a complete asshat, he's boring as hell and acts like a 5 year old. This show tries so hard to be realistic and deep but fails miserably. The other side characters (I forgot their names because they are so forgettable) are lame as fuck. There is also that one side character who is a boy that looks like a girl that's just cringey as fuck I don't know how anyone can sit through that shit without cringing so hard. Overall a horrible show that fails in all aspects of anime.",1

                Steins Gate is an amazing tale about the consequences of time travel, and the psychological effect it  has on our main protagonist Okabe.  Steins gate is an anime that makes you think while also being in a thrilling package. although the pacing at time is mundane and down right bad(episodes 6-12, IM looking at you). Yet, when all the answers come together in the end you shall be left speechless. You shall realize after re-watch, all the subtle things that are now obvious to you, and how they all come together in the final conclusion. First, art which was unimpressive, but not bad,
                  2nd sound also just ""good"". Now Characters Okabe, from Steins; Gate is probably the best character i have ever seen. He is out going a funny, but also way out in left field, yet he is also so human it hurts. Its the journey of Okabe and how he changes that truly makes Steins;Gate so amazing. This all combines into one of the greatest anime experiences ever and my personal 2nd favorite(1st also from 2011). THUS 9/10

                Hello? It's me. Change of plans the Organization found out. We have to start Yggdrasil operation.
It's kind of something so Okabe Rintaro speaks to your phone when it is caught off guard by something, or at random times. Okabe is a college student and self-proclaimed mad scientist who fight an organization that aims to rule the world. And that's the main character Steins; Gate, an anime with the differential being produced by two studios, a games and other drawings.
Steins; Gate follows Okabe in his ""laboratory"" creating inventions meaningless use, until one of these is shown a time machine prototype that can send SMS's pro past
                  and with it you see everything going on from the perspective of Okabe, since he is the one who can keep the memories of the past changed, that is, if it alters the past to get something, everyone forgets that he did not have it except him. With this plot, the story unfolds full of conspiracies, paradoxes and many other things related to time travel.
With a little slower than usual narrative, the story passes and throwing little by little vital information in your mind. The fact is such that the first episode is full of information that will be useful for closing the series. The story itself is fantastic, falling a few times in clich√©s misused and that the pace of the narrative increases little by little, making almost imperceptible the time spent watching the episodes, as the agonizing way he told the story, you always end up wanting more. The big problem is that the anime only begins to pick up pace after 3 or 4 episodes.
In terms of characters, unfortunately anime piece, the characters are very caricatured and barely believable, with few exceptions, you do not feel that charisma emanating from them, I ended up tying me Okabe by its also jeit√£o and Makise Kurisu the situations it passes, but otherwise you can not see motivation or development of some characters within the story. But the narrative ends up making you do not miss it while watching, just started to notice these details when the series and began to reflect on it.
The animation is very competent and consistent with the story. There are action scenes and when they happen are ""stops"" because this is not the focus of the anime, there focus is the story of the effect that ""Call Microwave (with name subject to change)"" changes the lives of everyone there and how it reflects in the world. Just like in Death Note, where the clash was mental, what matters here is the development and understanding of the mysteries. And the animation fulfills this very well.
The final, but do not give away some clich√©s, is somewhat unexpected. Although much you can deduct, the closure does not disappoint you, you're actually quite pleased with the end that was worthy. I have a little trauma to the end of series and designs, I never think that the end is commensurate with experience who initially had with the series, but Steins; Gate manages to close with a flourish.
With all this, here is a recommendation of an anime. Look Steins; Gate with a sensational story that makes you freak out.",9
"
                This is an enjoyable show if you switch off your brain. It had at least one very good twist and a few emotional moments. The first half is very slow and if you can get past it, you can get to a satisfying conclusion to the first season. I'm not a fan of the harem elements and trap elements though. That being said, this show is heavily over-rated.
Story is nothing special. Some guy is a scientist that laughs maniacally even though he says nothing scientific and shows no scientific expertise. He just seems like a crazy guy cosplaying a scientist. Then the weird time travel
                  BS kicks in which you can enjoy if you don't think about it too much.
Art is just average, nothing to write too much about.
Sound is ok, the opening was great and memorable, but that's just it.
Characters are weird and quirky MC laughs maniacally, there are traps, cute cat girls, tsunderes in this harem anime. Great for people who are into that kind of stuff.
You can definitely enjoy this as mindless entertainment but it cannot be taken seriously. Right now it is heavily over-rated. I did enjoy it when I watched it without critical thinking, getting over the tedious first half and enjoy a couple of twists in the second half with a few emotional moments. But I've never rewatched it and it's definitely not rewatchable unlike the best shows out there.
All in all i give it a 1/10 because it's so heavily over-rated.",1
"
                Now, I've always had a morbid fascination with time travel. Groundhog Day is one of my favourite movies, and I feel that it is a genre that is very difficult to nail properly. But Steins;Gate goes above and beyond here.
The story starts out with some comedic elements, but then it goes dark, very dark. This is where it grips you, and it doesn't let go until the very end. 
The art is memorable but not spectacular, if this was a 20 point scale I'd give it an 8.5
The sound, similar to the art is solid throughout and probably a weak 9, but a 9 nonetheless.
Character,
                  definitely a 10, for a 24 episode show, 4 of these characters rank among my very favourite in all of anime.
In terms of enjoyment, this is a show that all sorts of people would enjoy. Whether or not you like anime, this show would appeal to you if you like suspense/thrillers.
Overall, this show is a short and sweet masterpiece, only 8 hours long but leaves an impact that lasts forever.",10
"
                Hi, my name is barel titor. yeah, my daughter John Titor already wrote a review below. If you already finished the show, you know who i am.
The series was adapted from a visual novel. I don't know if everyone had a different experience about it, especially those who played the game but for those who didn't like me, it was a mind blowing experience.
At first, i thought it was hard to grasp and difficult to understand. The 1st episode was like ""ahh, i don't get it"". Shows like this are not quite my thing. I'm into moe, ecchi, fanservice genres. but ever since i had
                  a wife who's also a cosplayer, i started to find some amazing series to watch. i'm very lucky to find steins;gate. after episode 1, you'll notice a lot hentai jokes, funny nicknames, ridiculous references and more funny stuff. later on, you'll find out how awesome this show is. don't expect something in the first few episodes, just sit back and relax as it progress to a more complicated series of events. 
The characters were realy superb. but it would be more superb if they have bigger boobs and butts. With a limited budget, this show is detailed but lacks some fanservice stuff. They could have expand that shower scene and that ""oh it's raining and we're both wet"". The music was also good, especially the op and ed. the background music should have been naughty. The chemistry of the characters is great. that romance thing could have been more ero. Overall, this is one of the science fiction series to be remembered. of all time.
And this inspired me to finish the time machine, here in year 2036. We're very ""conCERNed"" here and we're lucky to have a mad scientisto there in 2010.
i got ""high five in my face with a chair"" by my daughter because of this review.
by the way pls. rewatch episode 1 if you have doubts about this show in the second half..",10
"
                College student and self-proclaimed MAD SCIENTIST Okabe Rintaro accidentally creates a time machine along with his friends. Little does he know about the repercussions of this act, and the effect it will have on his future.
Steins;Gate is a rare series based around time travel. The key phrase there is ""based around"". There are plenty of series that include time-travel in some way, or about the adventures of time travelers, but it is rare to find one about the actual act itself. It explores ideas of predestination, the effects of changing the past, etc. and does so in a way that the audience can follow. No
                  surprise then that plot twists aplenty come from every change they make.
This itself would be enough for a decently enthralling show, but the characters hit that sweet spot where you can actually connect and care about them. The diverse array of characters are flushed out fairly well, while never taking too much focus off of the plot. This brings the enjoyment of this series to an all new level, as the series progresses, the consequences of their actions are made clear, and the lives and futures that hang in the balance.
The opening is one of the better ones I've seen, with the lyrics directly referencing the show, talking about ""crossing World Lines"". It matches the show and gives you a real feeling of the events of the show (especially later on). The ending is maybe a bit above average, mainly for the music and how it picks up towards the end.
All in all, though some may feel it has a slow start, Steins;Gate is ultimately one of the most rewarding shows I've had the pleasure of watching, and I have no problem giving it my highest recommendation.
A movie that takes place after the series and follows the actions/consequences of events in the main series aired in Japan in April 2013. I'm looking forward to it when it makes its way over here.",10
"
                I took a risk with this one.  I had no idea what I was getting into, I just decided to take the plunge based off no recommendations at all, and was I surprised with what I got.
My initial surprise, unfortunately, was ""what the hell am I watching?"".  The show starts off a little awkwardly, when you realize the main character is trying to act as a mad scientist with no goals other than fighting back against an invisible organization.  This initially got on my nerves a little, especially when I made the mistake of watching the dub first (please don't expose yourself
                  to it, the voice actors in the subs portray the characters a lot better in my opinion).  I was reluctant to push on, especially when I looked into it a bit more and read how the plot involved time manipulation via microwave.  At that point, I really couldn't tell you what kept me going through the first few episodes, but there's something oddly intriguing about it.
When you push through that awkward hump in the show, you really can't stop watching it.  I finished it within a couple days.  Few shows based on the exploration of time travel really grab me, it's usually that cliche of the whole grandfather paradox, butterfly effect, or what-have-you.  While the show did broach on one of them, it really has its own way of going about things.  When you're launched into this world, you're launched hard, and you realize the severe implications of the main character's actions.  But you don't just realize it, you feel it.  Again, this is something that's almost exclusive to this show (for me).  I've seen quite a few movies and series that go on the subject, but none of them have ever made me feel why you shouldn't meddle with time.  Steins;Gate did this, and it did it hard.
Above that, you really do care for the characters, even the ones you should hate.  You really did want things to work for the best for everyone involved, because they really were just a group of people who got in over their heads.  I didn't mind joining the main character through repeats in time, where that might have bothered me in other shows, because the story was in full throttle to the main point.
It's rare that I find something where I can't think of any reason why anyone could possibly hate it.  Steins;Gate certainly isn't without its flaws (mainly, as stated, its weird start), but it has a great combination of everything you could ever ask for in a show (a good balance of cheesy vs witty humor, drama, action, sorrow, anger, happiness, etc).
If you're not watching it, I can understand your reluctance.  But you won't regret getting started once you start seeing what this show really has to offer.  It has great characters, it bases itself on tiresome cliches and promptly destroys them, it's visually appealing, and you really do invest yourself in it.  It's definitely going on my list of favorites.",9

                Stein‚Äôs Gate is a series that always feels better and more epic in retrospect but is underwhelming on subsequent rewatches. I seem to always recommend Stein‚Äôs Gate as one of the best anime ever made, but when it comes time to write a review, I can never explain why. Luckily, I just finished watching Stein‚Äôs Gate again, so I have more clear ideas and opinions about it. 
I should preface this review by stating that Stein‚Äôs Gate is more than likely the best time-travel anime out there. It has a good amount of rules and restrictions on what can and can‚Äôt be done. Stein‚Äôs Gate
                  also has an easy to follow premise when it comes to time travel. That being said, the biggest problem I have with Stein‚Äôs Gate has to do with plot holes and inconsistencies. This being a review and not an analysis, I will not go into detail about these inconsistencies to avoid spoilers; however, they are very noticeable. I haven‚Äôt seen Stein‚Äôs Gate 0, but I definitely understand the need to undo the ending as it was one giant plot hole all on its own. No aspect of the ending makes sense, and it‚Äôs even pointed out in the anime. They knew their ending didn‚Äôt make any sense. 
Execution-wise, Stein‚Äôs Gate is for sure one of the most well-made anime I‚Äôve ever seen. Stein‚Äôs Gate features consistently amazing graphic quality and sound quality. From the character designs to the backgrounds, to the color palette, to the ambient sounds, to music, to the voice acting, it is all A Grade work. Special kudos to Okabe‚Äôs voice actor. That‚Äôs a performance of a lifetime. 
Stein‚Äôs Gate presents itself as a plot-heavy anime, but the plot doesn‚Äôt really matter. The plot is used primarily for Okabe‚Äôs character development. Stein‚Äôs Gate is more about the characters and the journey. The last half is basically just The Okabe Show. It‚Äôs interesting and entertaining to watch, but nothing groundbreaking. The more ‚Äòepic‚Äô themes of fatalism and nihilism all dissolve by the end, leaving only a carcass of what could‚Äôve been. I guess you really can‚Äôt have themes like that without a Texhnolyze-esque ending. 
Okabe was in my top 10 characters earlier this year, getting inched out by slightly better characters. He‚Äôs justifiably the 6th most favorited character on MAL (at the time of this writing). Doubling down on him was the best possible decision this anime could‚Äôve made. Stein‚Äôs Gate is solely about Okabe, and for very good reasons. His conflicts and relationships with the other characters are what make Stein‚Äôs Gate the masterpiece that it is. 
With such a roller-coaster of a review, you‚Äôre probably wondering if I recommend Stein‚Äôs Gate. The score I gave should probably be an indicator, but Stein‚Äôs Gate is one of my all-time favorite anime. I tend to be overly critical of things that I like. It is just shy of my top ten, getting kicked out of there by better anime just this year (2019). I have one 10 and five 9s, so getting an 8 from me is pretty good.",8
"
                I feel like I would have probably enjoyed this anime wayyyyy more had I not already watched When They Cry beforehand because this just feels like a less entertaining version of that show. Not trying to offend anyone here (I‚Äôm a huge horror gore fan so I may be a little biased of course). Same time repeat scenario but horribly lacking in that mystery and thrill I was looking for. The plot felt somewhat predictable, having an incredibly slow start and an anticlimactic ending. The best part of the show was the whole world war 3 threat thing with Suzuha, I just wish that I
                  actually got to see more of the dystopia they hinted at. In general I just feel like there‚Äôs a lot of plot points that absolutely work but are never fully delved into enough, I would have loved to see more of the story from ‚ÄúSern‚Äôs‚Äù perspective, I loved the whole gruesome time travel experiment scene, it really showed how terrifying this organization is but there simply wasn‚Äôt enough of it. It seems like there is this build up for this ‚Äúbig bad guy‚Äù aka Sern that we never even get to really see beyond the people they hire to do their bidding, which is why I felt the ending felt so anticlimactic, they could have done something more intense with it imo. I know that there is a spin off series though so maybe there is hope. *shrug*
Now that being said it was still entertaining not a horrible regrettable watch by any means, It just wasn‚Äôt for me. I‚Äôm mostly just dumping my critique of the show here rather than what I really liked, I had heard a lot of people hype up this series for years so my expectations were pretty high. The art is at least very beautiful, cute character designs, (mostly) likable side characters, touching dynamic between the main character and his childhood friend, Mayuri. Didn‚Äôt hate it didn‚Äôt love it, not worth the hype but not a bad anime.",7
"
                What else is there to say? Amazing. I agree with the general sentiment that it started off a bit slow and confusing so stick with it! It really ramps up about midpoint and has you circling back to he beginning and connecting dots. Just like any great time travel story should. By the end I was left in awe- great ending and overall one of my favorite anime experiences of all time!

                This is one of the best anime out there, and if you haven't already watched it... well what are you doing???? Firstly i gave the story 10 because it is very deep and complex, it is well thought out and it really makes you think. If you haven't seen it then i'll warn you now it does have a bit of a slow start but stick with it and you find that it is amazing. The art is beautiful and unique, the songs are very well suited for the moments and damn... when you hear that opening song ahhhhhhhh so nice... so, the characters are
                  weird and hard to understand at first but after watching at least 5 episodes you'll see their quirks (tuturu) and easily relate to them. This is also one of the best anime for character development, i think that by the end all of the characters have come out with a completely different view of life.
So overall it offers a lot, and you would be stupid not to watch it. There's nothing that i can say that is bad about it, so hell go and watch it now!",10
"
                I just watched this in 2018. and I dare say that this is one of the best story anime I've ever seen, at first I do not really like anime with thriller genre, but I dare give perfect points for this one. the plot is very neat and not easy to guess, the character development is very good, the music is good from the opening and closing songs, and the background sound is perfect to support the atmosphere. not just to see, the audience also come to think what will happen next, just a little left, you will be made to be confused with the
                  story. more points, although the anime is a serious story but still provides scenes of scenes that are relaxed or entertaining so the audience is not always made tense and thinking. I'm not surprised why this gets a high rating",10
"
                Even though I know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover (specially when it comes to anime), I must admit that my first thought while watching the first few minutes of Stein's Gate went something along the lines of ""well, this doesn't look a masterpiece."" However, I decided to keep an open mind and trust the MAL reviews once again to see what would happen.   
Despite all the positive reviews and high ranking, it took me a while to get to this anime because I had never seen it appear on any kind of social network (in the form of pics, gifs,
                  fanart, cosplay, etc.). Instead, everywhere I went was plagued with references to pretty-but-crappy anime like Sword Art Online, Owari no Seraph, Uta no Prince-sama, and many, many more. Then again, the Kardashians seem to have a bigger following than Mozart these days, so why should I be surprised? 
And that's precisely what Stein's Gate is. It's a work by Mozart, Dali, or Shakespeare in a world of Kardashians and Justin Bieber. 
From the unpretentious art to the great characters and fantastic voice acting, this anime has everything to make it work. However, its most beautiful and powerful aspect is undoubtedly the story (which all of the series above seem to have forgotten about for the sake of being flashy and pretty). 
Since this show started out really slow for me, I decided to read up about it online somewhere halfway through. After scrolling through the Wikipedia page, I was shocked to discover that the ""see also"" part included the IBM 5100, John Titor, and CERN. After browsing through those as well, I made sure to check at least three times that what I was reading was, in fact, from Wikipedia and not from a ""Stein's Gate Wiki"" page (though some might say that their level of credibility is pretty much the same).
The reason for my shock was that I had never before seen an anime that was actually so historically accurate. Sure, the ""history"" may be pretty recent and not particularly meaningful or realistic (for John Titor's predictions never did come true), but the simple fact that the writers decided to incorporate something so real into something so out-of-this-world really struck a chord with me (because, of course, that would mean that it's really not THAT out of this world... Or is it?) 
If my review seems a bit confusing, it's probably because this anime often is too (specially in the beginning). I initially had trouble following along and found it a bit tiring (because it required every bit of my attention and concentration), but the excellent humor and voice acting kept me going. 
Although I already expected this anime to be mind-blowing due to the amazing reviews, both the art and the OST seemed initially unremarkable, which again made me skeptical as to just how good a ""good story"" could really be. After all, this is an age of pretty and pointless harems (Oreimo, SAO, etc.), so are there really people who still bother with, you know, a plot?
Turns out they do, and boy do they bother. From the fabulous real-life references mentioned above to the ability to create all kinds of moods (from relaxed to eerie to suspenseful and anything in-between), Stein's Gate really draws you in with an almost supernatural force.
The sad thing, however, is having to let go. Leaving behind characters who have stayed true to themselves (finally! a mad scientist surrounded by girls who focuses on actually being a mad scientist and not on being a harem lead) yet have also really developed is almost physically painful. 
As if having a great story wasn't enough, this anime also employs a wickedly talented seiyuu cast to make it come to life. While both Kana Hanazawa and Asami Imai (as well as all the other seiyuus) do fantastic jobs at voicing their characters, it is Mamoru Miyano who really shines through and brings this masterpiece together. From crazy mad-scientist-y laughter to surprise, sorrow, and everything in-between, Mamoru Miyano succeeds in conveying a range of emotions that you never thought could possibly be expressed with voice alone. As a result, it becomes impossible to imagine anyone else in this role and it makes the experience of watching this show truly memorable. 
Regardless of whether you choose to refer to this anime as ""mind blowing"", ""a masterpiece"", or anything else, you will definitely need a way to refer to it, for it will come back to haunt you more than once. Whether it is as a part of a discussion, a review, or even in your own mind, Stein's Gate is one of those extremely rare shows that stays both in your heart and mind long after the credits have rolled.",10
"
                I never write reviews and to be honest it has been a long time since I have first watched Steins;Gate, I remember, some guy from work recommended it and I though it was stupid from what he told me, it took me a while to give it a go but I ended up watching it.
As everyone that has watched this knows, Steins;Gate is slow at the start, and that is what makes it so great, it just comes out of nowhere, I can't explain how much I have enjoyed watching this anime but I just can't get tired of it. I have watched it 5
                  times now (+6 times the movie, also movie haters can go watch Hello Kitty) It's just so great, it makes you think so much, it's just so well written.
Okabe, a ""mad sciiiiiiiientistttttt"", talks to himself and seems pretty weird, no-one could even begin to think how great he was going to be, I never though I would admire a character so much. It just took me by surprise, it's just so amazing, he is the greatest character I have ever seen, Kudos to the writers.
There is so much more I would talk about but I'm not very good at this so i'm just going to say something.
I cannot recommend this anime to everyone, if you are very close minded or a c*nt then don't watch it, you won't enjoy it one bit. If you minimally smart and are a cool guy/girl then watch this right away, your life will change (not really, just mine). So yeah, Watch it.

                (There won't be many spoilers in this review, it will more just be talking about the shows nature as a whole product. Specific instances involving minor spoilers will be noted in **SPOILER** tags)
Intro:
If you had asked me how I feel about Steins;Gate when I was about 12 episodes in, I would have told you ""It's the most slow, painfully remedial, overhyped anime I have ever had the displeasure of watching."" And in some essence, to the moment of this review's conception, those words are still true: I still feel Steins;Gate drags its feet for far too many episodes in its early stages, to the point
                  where I found them impossible to enjoy. While it should be noted that I am generally not a follower of sci-fi anime, or sci-fi culture in general, I considered the first half of Steins;Gate to feel more like a slice of life than anything else; this was mainly due to the fact that instead of clearly showcasing important plot points, Steins;Gate shows you the situations through the same mentality of the protagonist and his friends. Basically, the mask of humour and casual tone of the uses of time travel detracts your attention from the possibility of plot development. 
These assumptions about the nature of the show made its first half a real pain in the ass for me, since I felt the characters were way too cliche (in most cases they actually are) and the dull repetition of uninteresting experiments was hardly outweighed by its immature humour. It got to the point where I almost dropped it because I couldn't stand the way the show meandered about stuff I thought it had already covered 3 episodes ago (not to mention the infuriatingly bland and predictable dialogue in the shows more casual parts). However, as I delved deeper and deeper into the second half of the show, I began to realize something about the true nature of Steins;Gate.
Story (8): 
This anime isn't designed to please the general public every episode. The writing is somewhat unconventional, in that instead of having the common 'problem / problem intensifies / resolution' sort of arc structure, S;G uses its entire first 12 episodes to build the problems before resolving them in its last 12 episodes. This could be likened to a professional golfer placing a bunch of bumpers along the path toward the hole; you feel bored and impatient watching him place seemingly random bumpers everywhere, but when he hits the ball and pings every one on the way to the hole, you can't help but be impressed. Of course, in that analogy you would likely forget your boredom of watching him set up the bumpers. In Steins;Gate, however, you are forced to remember the impatience and boredom you felt during these events, because their casual nature was paramount to the success of the following explanation.
Like I said, Steins;Gate does not pander to its audiences by following a strict criteria in its distribution of plot points. The new approach it takes is not done purely to make the ending feel much more dramatic, but is in fact linked to the core foundations of ideas behind the show. S;G asks you to reflect on your actions, and more importantly, to understand that your actions have consequences. The reason there is such a carefree nature and insinuation of unimportance surrounding the earlier experiments is so that there are casual acts to be reflected on later. After all, if you want to reflect on the consequences of your actions the wisdom you draw from the experience will only be as powerful as the consequences you experienced, and those consequences will only be as severe as the actions that caused them. This show asks you to remember what right decisions and what mistakes got you to where you are now, whether changing those things is really worth it, and how you should conduct similar situations (or your entire life) in future.
Art (8):
No complaints here. The characters are pretty well drawn I suppose (I love the eyes in this show), and the transition flashes between arcs added a splash of creativity to the visuals, but other than that it's just ""good"". The show doesn't have an overwhelming amount of fighting or other heavily movement reliant scenes, so it's tough to comment on stuff like fluidity.
Sound (10):
Perfect. All of the voice actors went above and beyond my expectations, hit all of the right notes in regards to the personalities of their characters and never went overboard. The OP is awesome too.
Character (5):
Yes, I have a big problem with the characters. First of all, the fact that they are all just stereotypes tugged from some sort of ""Anime for Dummies"" guide ticks me off right away, so if assuming all scores start at 10 and have points subtracted from there on, lets put that at 8 for me so far. Now drop it to 7 because after the first 3 or 4 episodes, the characters turn into little more than plot devices used to provide filler where there are gaps in the dialogue. Clearly this is a point open to a lot of bias, so as far as my opinion goes: any conversation Okarin (yes I'm going to call him that) had with any character between episodes 5 and 11 (before you get to the specific arcs) could have the second character swapped around with anyone else and give exactly the same result. Why don't these characters get attention? 
**MINOR SPOILERS**During the first 10 or so episodes you get SOME form of character interaction / development, but it's mainly just in the form of cliched character templates exercising their cliches in (what I believe is) a shockingly unfunny way. During the early stages of Okarin time jumping, Kurisu is like a machine, just idly accepting whatever Okarin has to say and regurgitating plot directions with no impact or personality. During the entirety of episodes 14-20, any character that isn't Okarin / Kurisu (/ one of the two focuses of the arcs) just gets left in the dust. **END MINOR SPOILERS** 
It's almost like the character were intentionally made irritating and dull until the final episodes, much like the story until the final episodes; as if the beginning of this anime was made intentionally bad just to make the last half appear great. Steins;Gate gives you the ""illusion"" of character development and the ""appearance"" of character interaction, but in the end there is no more substance to the dialogue and relationships between the characters (or even substance in the individual characters themselves) than what appears on their surface, save for the sudden dramatic emotional downpours that will hit in the final episodes (which, as mentioned, is made all the more powerful by the lack of emotional impact in any previous episodes). Some people like this kind of approach; I can definitely say I find it distasteful.
Enjoyment (5):
I personally did not like this anime. I can understand why people could possibly like it, but for me the aspects of it that I didn't like were just far too great to be overridden by the uniquity of its storytelling. As already stated, the dislike I had from the characters right from the word go just ruined the casual side of the show for me, whilst the length of the indulgence in said casual side left me feeling impatient and restless about the actual storyline. Taking a somewhat objective viewpoint, Steins;Gate is a standout in the field of anime due to its carefully intertwined story structure built off of even more carefully laid foundations of ideas. 
That isn't to say, however, that I found such deliberate and long winded foundations anything close to entertaining. No amount of genius in the end of the show could fully compensate for the bad taste the first half left in my mouth. The latter half, while certainly a lot more interesting than the beginnings of the show, focused far more on the character relationships than the reasoning behind the characters actions. The scifi aspect of the show isn't elaborated on but instead thrown aside, used as a backdrop to emphasise blossoming romance and the pains of friendship. Honestly, I came to this anime looking for a focused, clever story about time travel, but I found this was not the real focus of Steins;Gate. All S;G really wanted to be was an emotional drama with a twist of time travel thrown in, and since I've already noted how easy I find it to dislike the characters and their adventures, this part of Steins;Gate just did not hit home for me.
Overall (7):
Steins;Gate took me on a rollercoaster ride, but not in the traditional 'up and down, up and down, up and down' fashion. This show only had one 12 episode long trip up, one 3 episode long gap as I prepared for the rush, and one 9 episode long slide down to earth that left me thinking nothing but ""that was it?"" It is perfectly possible (and usually necessary) to maintain a sense of interest and enjoyment in your audience throughout the entirety of a series, not just attempt to do so in the final few episodes; either Steins;Gate doesn't understand that, or it is unable to both understand that and appeal to someone of my tastes in characters / writing. I'm inclined to think the former is true.",7
"
                Well, this is by far my first review so hope you will go easy on me. I would rather to start with the plot, it's so 'scary' interesting, if you're the guy who is into electronics/retro-computers/puzzles this is sure an anime you should watch, I like when they mention real life elements in anime and specially if it's one of my hobbies, there are no gap holes in the series, there is answer to everything you might seek, in short it's an anime with it's complete story. The art, is splendid, they did a pretty good job at the animating. The sound is splendid too,
                  every piece of sounds fits the appropriate scene like no other could, some are emotional, some scary. About the characters, all of them are given a voice, and animation with love and care, they're all original, their art style their eyes, their everything! Just love them... I just enjoyed this anime like no other in it's genre ^_^",10
"
                I would like to talk a little about Steins; Gate. It is good to emphasize that at first I am not a critical exile, but I want to share my experience with the work.
Preliminarily, I was watching about 1 episode of S;G per year (it's not even a meme), but I ended up arranging with friends to watch the anime together. My first impression was not the best, however I understood that the 1st half of the anime was extremely important to explain the theory, not only that but after finishing the work I noticed that it was the best part of the anime.
Furthermore, when
                  the anime ‚Äúbegins‚Äù for many is where I most questioned my reason for living. As I recall, they actually start to travel through time and in the course of that we have just one of the worst death directions I've ever seen in an anime, besides the piece trying to deliver some twists, which revolve around Suzuha and Moeka. In the long run, the Suzuha context is interesting and ‚Äúwell‚Äù worked, but with the exception of Moeka freaking out ‚Äúrightly‚Äù in episode ‚Äúx‚Äù, she simply played a poor part in the plot, I disliked the twist they proposed around her.
I have to mention some negative points that made me dislike the work, in a time travel anime I would very much like to see ""time travel"" itself and not just stay in theory or travel in the ""present"", Okabe is easily one of the worst scientists there is, because even having Kurisu on his side, our ""MC"" still has difficulty finding ""simple"" resolutions throughout the plot. Finally, Okabe's romance with Kurisu was taken out of ‚Äúcool‚Äù.
Therefore, I found S;G extremely dull and tiring at times, as important as these moments are for the unfolding of the story, it could have been a shorter anime. Steins;Gate is an anime for cults or simply people who demanded a little more from their respective ‚ÄúIQ‚Äù to understand the anime and were in need of giving ‚Äú10‚Äù for an extremely overrated work.
In summary, I have nothing to complain about the theory and some characters that served as comic relief, if I were to analyze some basic criteria for Steins; Gate would look something like this:
History: 7.0
Animation: 6.5
Entertainment: 3.5
Characters: 3.5
Sound: 0
Totaling 4.1 of overall grade.
The problem with the S;G hype is that no one has made a better Sci-Fi (I mean the whole work), which is not ‚Äúvery‚Äù difficult, I hope that in a few years, someone will do it and that we can laugh a lot when it happens. Again, even though it's not my favorite theory, Steins proposes a formidable theory and it's what carries the anime as it falls short on several factors.",4
"
                An overall fantastic series. This anime will definitely leave a massive impression on you if you give it the time and chance. I almost gave up straight after the first episode due to not being able to follow what was happening, but in retrospect this is necessary to allow a brilliantly constructed story to unfold to a climactic and satisfying conclusion. 
Time travel concepts and the physical laws imposed are thought through in great depth. I love how they relate to modern physics at some points to add depth and realism to the plot. Great looking anime, fantastically unique characters, quality soundtrack and voice acting,

                This show is generally praised and has a pretty high rating. That's why I kept watching it up to the last episode even though I disliked it right from the beginning.
The problem I immediately had is the main character. I found it irritating and stupid. It would have been fine if the show actually took off after a 2-3 episodes; but enduring his idiotic behaviour for a dozen of episodes was too much. By the time the action actually kicks in, I couldn't take him seriously, I couldn't care about the other characters, and the plot wasn't good enough (for someone interested in time travel
                  stories) to save the anime. The main character ruined the show for me.
I can only recommend to watch a bunch of episodes and see by yourself if you can bear with him. If he's ok for you, you probably can enjoy this show. If you find him irritating and stupid, just avoid this show.",1

                Brilliant. Simply Brilliant. From character development to the storyline, it's perfect. 
This is an anime of high caliber and I recommend anime fans to watch this show. Though it is 24 episodes, which could be rather short, the anime is compressed and well organized for a short series.
The storyline above all else was truly amazing. First, I was confused but slowly started to get it. It isn't very hard to understand so most people should be able to understand. I'm still surprised as how well the story was made, you can notice that the writers but a lot of thought into this show.
The artistry of
                  the anime wasn't exquisite or terrible. I don't think the artistry of this show will effect the show itself that much. But it is still well done.
The Voices for the characters are perfect. Each voice fits the character perfectly. From Okabe to Mayuri. It's simply beautiful hearing these voices.
The characters also fit in very well with the story. You have the mad scientist, a hacker and a innocent young girl. It's perfect! What's more impressive is the development of the characters throughout the story. A lot of things change in a blink of an eye and it's truly an amazing experience.
Overall I would give this anime a 10/10. Fully deserved. I loved everything that occurred in this anime and the flaws are miniscule.",10

                Steins;Gate is a work of art. I went in based on how highly rated and praised it was by so many people, and after finishing it, I can completely see why. Steins;Gate deserves every bit of praise that it gets. 
Story: 10/10
Quite possibly the best fictional work I've seen in terms of story and plot development, better than any TV show, movie, book, video game, etc. The story mainly unfolds through the main character, Okabe Rintarou, the goofy and lovable mad scientist who invents a time machine and navigates the consequences that comes with messing around with one. The spotlight is placed on Okabe's development,
                  who slowly turns hopeless and nihilistic as he continuously deals with consequences and tragedy. It's impossible not to root for Okabe, to be excited when he triumphs and to feel bad for him when he fails. Okabe is constantly presented with numerous incredibly difficult decisions and has to sacrifice not only his own happiness but the happiness and fortune of those close to him.
Time travel is a very common focus in sci-fi stories, often resulting in confusing and convoluted stories that take way too much time to properly understand. Steins;Gate stands out for its (mostly) clear presentation, as it gradually builds up and slowly establishes the rules for time travel while keeping it easy enough to understand. 
While it starts off very slow and confusing, the story ramps up gradually over time, with the second half being a nonstop ride of jaw-dropping plot twists and emotional roller coasters. I've never experienced a show that made me feel more anxiety, more despair, and just general emotion. I'm usually a pretty stoic and unemotional person when it comes to stories, but Steins;Gate has the honor of being the only piece of media to ever make me shed genuine tears. It builds up towards an extremely satisfying, albeit too clean and happy, ending that will leave you with a giant smile on your face. 
That being said, the story isn't without some degree of fault. Being a story about time travel and really pushing for a happy ending, the story ultimately ends up being somewhat contrived in a lot of aspects. There are quite frankly too many plot conveniences, randomly introduced mechanics, and unexplained phenomena to simply ignore. It's mostly small and inconsequential, but it's noticeable enough to raise an eyebrow and honestly left me with a bit of a sour feeling at times, but the overall plot direction and conclusion more than make up for it in my eyes. 
Art: 7/10
The art style of Steins;Gate is more realistic than your typical anime, and overall I think it fits quite well. In terms of genuine quality it's pretty standard and nothing to write home about. There are well-directed scenes and the quality and design was very consistent, but again, nothing outstanding or incredibly memorable. 
Sound: 9/10
The music was overall quite good, and it usually fit the scenes they were placed over, but none of it felt very impactful or memorable to me. My praise for Sound comes from the opposite - the use of silence and natural noises. Steins;Gate often uses plenty of natural sounds and backdrops to really lull you into the world. The moments where the music completely stops are very effectively done, and are oftentimes the most powerful scenes. 
The voice actors were spot on. They perfectly fit their characters and had excellent delivery for all of their lines. 
This is also the only show where I actually bothered to watch the OP for each episode because of how much I liked it. 
Character: 8/10
For the most part, characters in Steins;Gate are funny and likeable enough, though they definitely are a bit archetypal. You have the small and cute one, the tsundere, the pervy guy, etc., though they all have unique enough characteristics to set them apart. 
The main cast has fun and interesting banter with one another, and it really feels like they're one big team. However, these group dynamics aren't all that frequent. As I mentioned before, the story mostly unfolds through Okabe and his actions, meaning that we mostly get a taste for the characters through his interactions with them, usually resulting in some kind of emotional moment or climax with a specific character. While these are usually well handled and the characters are definitely interesting, I personally felt that it stretched a little *too* much in trying to make you care about certain characters, especially one character, Mayuri, who was a central character and frequently featured yet did nothing truly notable or helpful, mostly serving as a plot device that motivates Okabe. 
The female lead, Makise Kurisu, is a definite highlight of Steins;Gate. She is incredibly likeable, helpful, and really pushes the plot along. Some of the best moments in the show are her interactions with Okabe and seeing their relationship develop over time, which feels somewhat cliche at times, but it's hard to not root for the both of them. 
Another one of my main complaints about Steins;Gate comes in here, though: outside of Okabe, who has some of the most incredible character development I've ever seen, none of the other characters really get any kind of development, except Kurisu to a degree. From start to finish, none of the side characters really ever change or have something interesting happen to them. It's mostly fine because again, the story mostly focuses on Okabe, but I still would have liked to see more development for other characters. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
I think my review has already made this clear. Steins;Gate is one of the most enjoyable anime I've seen in recent times. It's been a long time since I was so invested in a story, where I couldn't stop watching episode after episode. The emotional and overall impact this show had on me is immense - it's the kind of show that makes you think about life and leaves a hollow feeling within you when you finish it. 
You must have heard plenty of other reviews gushing about this show already, so please, just do yourself a favor: watch Steins;Gate. You won't regret it. 
*EDIT - ONE YEAR LATER REWATCH*
For the past year, this show has not been able to leave my mind. It was all I could think about for a few weeks after I first finished it, and up until now, I thought about it in one way or another most days. I decided that I owed it to myself to finally rewatch what I considered to be not only my favorite anime, but my favorite story of all time. And you know what?
It was just as good as I remembered it being. 
The complaints I listed here definitely still stand, and honestly, they were a lot more prominent to me this time around. The plot conveniences and randomly introduced mechanics and whatnot are very eye raising, but the overall strength of the plot is so good that it really doesn't bother me enough. I already knew all the major events and plot twists, so the impact of the story was lessened this time around, but I was still completely invested all the way through and the emotional climaxes still really impacted me, and the ending is still just absolutely perfect. Episodes would still blow by without me even realizing it, and I still listened to the OP each time. 
I truly love this anime with all my heart, and I doubt I'll ever find something that will replace it for me. I'll say it once again: watch Steins;Gate. You won't regret it. I promise.",10

                ""If that doesn't affect you then your heart is already broken.‚Äù
Makise Kirisu (Steins;Gate)
The quote means little outside the context of the show. Within it, however, it is powerful enough to draw tears from your eyes. While Steins;Gate is a brilliant and exciting tale about a team of time travelers, it is also a tale of sadness and sacrifice.
Story: 10/10
Steins;Gate is about a self-proclaimed mad scientist, Rintarou Okabe, whose experiments lead him and his fellow lab members, Mayuri Shiina and Hashida Itaru, to the discovery of a device that can send emails to the past. The discovery triggers a series of events that compel Okabe to
                  traverse diverging time lines.
The first few episodes are hardly as exciting as you'd expect given the synopsis. That is, until the discovery that the 'Phone Microwave', one of the team's numerous inventions, can send emails to the past. This is leads to the discovery of an evil organization which was once believed to be a figment of Okabe's imagination. From this point on the pace of the show picks up, mixing periods of great success and happiness with moments of devastating failure and grief.
A wonderful aspect of the show is its simplicity: the concepts of time travel explained in the show are easy to grasp.
Characters: 10/10
The show's characterization is an excellent blend of clich√©s and surprises. There's a perverted nerd who's dependable; a tsundere scientist who provides support to Okabe when he needs it the most; a flighty girl whose powers of observation are amazing; and a shy, svelte lady who...you'll find out. However, these characters are not nearly as developed as Okabe.
As the plot advances, Okabe transitions from an eccentric, carefree scientist to a less eccentric, selfish person, almost broken by sorrow. Only the support of his lab members keep him going.
Art: 9/10
While the art is not spectacular, it's as realistic as it needs to be and is easy to interpret. Sombre moments are rendered perfectly. Also, you never get bored of the settings even though there aren't many of them.
Sound: 10/10
It's difficult to fault the background music of the show. Light-hearted melodies emphasized periods of happiness. But the tunes that played during the periods of failure were the most moving.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Steins;Gate is a thoroughly enjoyable show. I found it difficult to get into initially and even put it on hold for a few weeks. But when I returned to the show and resolved to finish it, I was rewarded with a beautiful anime and a few hours worth of crying. I'd suggest you finish the anime on a Saturday so you have the whole of Sunday to recover.
I'd recommend you see Steins;Gate. And while you're at it, I'll be trying my very best to wipe the show from my memory so I can see it again.",10
"
                Easily the best story out of the Science Adventure Series trilogy, SAS for short (Chaos;Head, Robotics;Notes and Steins;Gate itself).
Just like the other SAS anime, the story started off very slowly building up ALL the characters in the show. It is worth every bit of your attention though as every little thing and foreshadowing that happens in the first 7 episodes become major plot in the later episodes. 
You will grow to love all the characters, yes they are all weird in their own respects but that is what makes them so alive, so real, so believable and relatable.
The stuck up, know it all genius scientist
                  Makise Kurisu. A prodigy since birth she is a neurologist at the age of 18
The seemingly retarded yet cutesy girl, Mayushii (Tu Tu Ru~~ need i say more? XD)
The mysterious, more than meets the eye ""part time soldier"" Suzuha Amane. 
Owner of the Nyan Cafe Feiris Chan. At age 18 she promoted and spread Moe Culture to the entire town.
SUPAH HAKAH and the typical textbook Otaku, Itaru Hashida. A genius programmer who hacked government system at the age of 18.
And last but not least, the heroic MAD SCIENTIST none other than Okabe Rintarou himself (a.k.a Hououin Kyoma you sonovabiz XD)
Every character is explored in great depth that you grow attached to each of them. This is not your typical time travel show, the time travel concept in this show is very unique. Time travel is done by sending SMS to the past as well as sending your memory as 'data' to the past, unlike the typical physical Time Travel crap they show in western series.
Finally the romance is OUTSTANDING. Ever wonder what romance would be like between an 18 year old neurologist and a first year uni guy with the same IQ as Isacc Newton himself? Well, watch Steins Gate and witness the Unique romance between two brainy, logical teens. no typical 'notice me senpai,' girl crying herself to sleep or any of those typical shoujou scenes.",10
"
                Steins;Gate. A sci-fi drama with a smattering romance based on time travel. What an experience that was. 
Story: Let‚Äôs start with the flaws first. The very slow start may seem very‚Ä¶ jarring for some, if not most, people. Yes, there is a point to it, and in my eyes, it serves as a very good set up, as it explains key plot points and characters that later parts of the show won‚Äôt have time for. However, slow is slow, and for the most part, the first segment of the series was unmemorable, even though it did have its moments. Also, somewhere in the middle of
                  the show, harem elements are pulled out of nowhere, making way for very out of place scenes and interactions. It really wasn‚Äôt needed, as the show already had a great romantic subplot, with good development no less. In addition, a few character backgrounds weren‚Äôt properly explained, however this is somewhat forgivable because considering the amount of content of the show, adding any more may make the viewer confused.
Now, why did I want to get the flaws out of the way?  Well, simply put, despite their existence, this show has one of the most brilliant plots that I have ever seen in any medium.
The first segment, despite being a bit slow, was still intriguing enough for me to not drop the show entirely. And in return, Episode 12 rewards us with fast plot movement. The dramatic tension rises significantly, making way for a lot of goosebump moments.
Speaking of drama, Steins;Gate does a fantastic job at balancing its dramatic elements along with its comedic elements. Unlike shows like Full Metal Alchemist or Fate Stay Night, the two very different genres never seem to clash with each other, and when they come up they never seem out of place, creating a very well rounded tone for the show. It could be a lighthearted comedy between a mad scientist and his lab buddies, and it could also be a darker toned drama about a man battling against time and inevitable consequences. 
Another thing I‚Äôd like to mention is how well this show does at explaining its key plot points. Steins Gate makes its intricate premise seem so‚Ä¶ simple, and it hardly leaves any plot threads dangling. In addition, despite time travel being a very iffy sub genre, this show never feels clich√©d or convoluted, and it remains original and a one of a kind.
Characters: I‚Äôd go so far to say that Okabe Rintarou, our male lead, has everything that makes, in my opinion, a fantastic and fascinating character. Seriously! He has defining characteristics, great depth and development, and above all, likeability. Our first impression of him is a delusional young man trying to be a world conquering mad scientist. This is already awesome itself, and in addition, later parts of the show prove that he is more than that. He pits against my other favourite male leads.
Next up is Makise Kurisu, our female lead. To label this redheaded budding scientist a textbook tsundere would be a complete and utter lie, as her human and realistic side of her proves otherwise. The best part about Kurisu is not only her character itself, but the chemistry Okabe and Kurisu create throughout the series. I‚Äôm not only talking about the romantic side of it, but also how well these two adapt to both their comedic banters to their emotional and fragile encounters. At first sight, they may seem like polar opposites, but by the end of the day, they both share the same intellectual insight and ambitions creating the dynamic duo they are.
As for the rest of the characters, they do their jobs, and they do them well. There isn‚Äôt a single character in Steins;Gate‚Äôs cast that seems out of place, and each of them has their own respective backgrounds a depth, making way for a very diverse cast. However, though this is more on a personal note, I really only felt myself intrigued by the shows‚Äô main duo. However, when all‚Äôs said and done, Steins;Gate does a fantastic job at presenting its characters.
Art/Animation: The art and animation were done by White Fox. To summarize the general gist of the visual quality, it can range from simplistic to simply eye boggling. The character designs were original and done well. My only main complaint would be Okabe, as he looks a LOT older than he really is. My jaw literally dropped when I found out he was only a teenager.
Sound: I‚Äôd call the soundtrack for Steins;Gate fitting yet forgettable. It does what it needs to when a certain scene calls for it, but nothing really stood out unfortunately. The OP and ED, however, are a complete different beast. The OP is pure eye candy, and along with the song ‚ÄòHacking to the Gate‚Äô by Itou Kanako, it fits the show to the T. The ED has a very creepy feel to it, and it does a great job. One small thing I would like to mention is at the end of Episode 9, it has this fantastic transition to the ED song, and along with the glossy art and animation, it does a fantastic job at raising the drama. 
The English dub is an interesting thing to talk about. While I have no right to judge an anime‚Äôs Japanese dub (as I am not bilingual in any shape or form), I do find it very easy on the ears. In fact, the Japanese dub was so well received by most fans that they find it jarring that this show even has an English dub, despite how amazing it is. Steins;Gate has one of the best dub cast that I have ever seen thus far, and this is where I shake my head at the fanboys when I say I prefer this dub over sub. 
J Michael Tatum brings a very bombastic performance as Okabe, while Trina Nishimura does a fantastic job at capturing Kurisu‚Äôs tsundere-ish yet down to earth personality. The entire cast does a brilliant job at portraying their respective characters, and each and every actor is a standout in their own special way. Props to Funimation for bringing, yet again, another fantastic dub. 
Final Comments: The flaws are few, but noticeable, and to call this perfect would be a lie. However, this show is a one of a kind, and it‚Äôs so engrossing that the flaws hardly matter. In a world where overhyped shows such as Sword art Online exists, there are also shows like Steins;Gate that actually deserve the hype it receives. A brilliant plot, a diverse cast of characters, and an intriguing romance; how can you go wrong?

                Steins;gate. This is probably one of the greatest anime out there. Although the story has a slow start,  but as it goes on it gets amazing. I liked the show because it has everything I would want in an anime. Romance, mystery, suspense, comedy, and a story dark at times. The voice acting is great (3 words sonofabitch). The characters are really good like the great HOUOUIN KYOMA himself. The characters develop as the story goes on. (In a good way). Overall, this anime is fantastic.  
              ",10

                This is an anime that needs patience.It took me 4 months to finaly finish the first episode.The story has a really slow start and pace, but it develops beautifully.Even if I feel like it took it 19 episodes to really begin it , those episodes being only setup,it has some awesome plot twists.The theories are very interesting.The characters are developed really well and the art is perfect.
But, it is not perfect. I found out that when he gives his memories to the past/one in another time line,we never see what happens to the Okabe,um,sorry,Hououin Kyouma that gave them.I think that he is very sad,espacially during
                  the first time leap.I find it really unrealistic to compres 3.2 terras into a few kilo.
Other than that,this is a masterpiece and a must watch anime for anyone that loves them.
P.S:This is only my 3rd review and I hope I did well and thank you for reading :)",10
"
                      Steins;gate plot is simple. Some guys messing with time travel. The story explores the possibilities of it, its paradoxes and effects it can cause, and the main cast of characters dealing with problems they caused because of their abuse of time travel.
Watching this characters interact is really a pleasure. The humor of their dialogs contribute to give an ordinary feel to the story. If the characters didn't had such good chemistry steins;gate would not be as good as it is, specially because there is not much happening at first. Everything is simple at the start, the first half of
                  the show is really a good build up for the second half, and it really pays of. 
Besides of the plot the show looks good, the animation is not really great but is enough for the kind of show. The music is not memorable except for the opening song. This is not bad, as the silence strings along perfectly with the quiet atmosphere of the show, and the voice of the protagonist is like music to my ears, and I don't even speak japanese.",9
"
                Steins;Gate
Story: 8/10
The story centres around a Microwave and the ability to send messages to the past, which is always the driving force for the show, but this series shone with how it incorporated the Characters and made their side stories intertwine with the main so you don't notice a change in how the series is focused. 
Like a typical ""Thriller"" it covers all bases and brings a good amount of Drama and stuff that will keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting to watch another episode after another.  
Overall it's a fantastic story not many times you finish a series and
                  think ""They done the story near perfectly"" But i felt that with Steins;Gate.
Art: 8/10
The art was really nice, The one big advantage the style has going for it was its ability to showcase emotions very easily, You can feel the moments when the character(s) felt happy/sad etc.. 
Only down side was many characters clothing was a bit bland not much variety, but doesn't hurt the score at all.
Sound: 8/10
Everything sound wise was great, Characters suited their personalities, Shown emotion very well at times, Miyano Mamoru who voices Okabe was a stand out for me. Also the OP is wonderful, First time i heard it it put me straight back to Myself;Yourself ED Which was also done by Itou Kanako, Her voice is just perfect. ED Was solid as well so overall this series sounded fantastic.
Character: 10/10
A story can only take you so far in a series, The characters have to live up to the that or even better it. Character development is also very important and for Steins;Gate it was a driving force, The way for example Okabe can turn from a Crazy Scientist with a very over the top with his personality and change on a flip of a coin to someone who is very sad, melancholic and at times poetic. 
This is where the series excels and takes charge right from the beginning till right to the end. Even characters like Okabe's Childhood friend Mayuri Shiina, Doesn't seem the brightest girl, and in a Lab full of intelligent people she gets lost, She is more a mascot than a Lab Member, but nevertheless they hardly give you any backstory for her and fully rely on the relationships they build in the series to make you really care for her, Even if she isn't really involved much, this is how good the Development & Characters truly are, They can make you feel something for someone who really shouldn't matter much.
Overall: 9/10
Steins;Gate is one of those series where even if the story doesn't seem to interest you, even if the genre isn't your favorite, I still think the way they have done Steins;Gate you will still love it like i do, I enjoyed pretty much all the Characters which is rare for me, and the story will keep you hooked right till the end.
I liked how they portrayed how every little thing you do can alter the future and how those consequences can affect the society around them to even themselves and their lives.
They even add a little bit of Romance which again was a great way to add extra emotion into the show and was done in the right manner and really worked well within the show.
Steins;Gate is amazing, One series you have to watch, I now find myself a little lost without a new series to see, when you finish a really good series you feel a little sad you won't ever see it again like you did, this is the case with Steins;Gate, Which for me speaks volumes of my feelings towards this show.
Also there was a film released around April 2013, I hear Subs of it may take a while and with it not even released yet on BluRay as just out in Cinema's, don't expect it out for a long while, maybe looking around Nov/Dec time, that is far too long to wait for me, but if lives up the rest of the series it will be worth the wait.",9
"
                At first, I don't really want to watch this anime which type is ""science-fiction"", because the fiction part may take the most rather than the science and the story may be made up and too random.
I am glad that this anime is too good. In fact this anime has more part in ""intensity"" and ""thriller"" and ""mystery"" than the science fiction part.
==============================================
CONCEPT
==============================================
Well. This anime concept is about ""Time travelling"" anime. Perhaps, there are so many anime with the same concept like this. Okabe Rintarou as the main characters invented a machine that can send message to the past.. Well, seems no  interesting right? How
                  about the message can change the world so differently...
For Example, you send message to the past ""Do push up this morning"", then a world changed so differently... And, you don't even know how come it can be changed.. You will end up ask yourself why. This is why this anime concept is so good, because it will bring mystery as well as thriller.
==============================================
WHAT I LIKE
==============================================
Well I like most of them.
The art is beautiful. The light, the gray and color composition.
I like the way they manage to decide to play background sound or not. It is so interesting.
I like the mysterious part of the anime. Why this become this, how come..
The emotion is strong. I can feel the happiness, the sadness, the disappointment. The intensity.
The characters has so many diversity and very constant through the anime and then their true colors is covered at the later episodes and make the twists.
==============================================
BAD PART
==============================================
Some people say the first episodes is draggy and boring, but it is needed to bring the shows and introduce the main conflict.
Well, sometimes, you don't need to explain the science part though because it is fiction, viewers actually do not need to know the wave or the compression, etc, but it is okay because it is not too much. Perhaps only 3 or 5 minutes maximum.
I also don't care about the minor plot hole here. But It is okay for me, because it is too minor to be noticeable.
==============================================
SUMMARY
==============================================
This is about the mystery thriller anime wrapped in science action theme and this is the best mystery-thriller anime I have ever seen.",10
"
                To this day, I still cannot grasp the love for this series. ‚ÄúThe beginning is slow!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou have to keep watching it!‚Äù ‚ÄúMost people drop it only after like‚Ä¶ 6 episodes‚Ä¶‚Äù Well, here‚Äôs my 2 cents. No anime should take THAT LONG for me to finally hold a somewhat bland interest in it. Allow me to go more into detail.
I really struggled to finish this series. It‚Äôs as everyone says. The beginning is SUPER SLOW and agonizingly boring. Nevertheless, I got through it to the end. And to my surprise, I was very dissatisfied. 
Things that I thought were great about Steins Gate:
The most amazing
                  thing about this series is the unique art style. I really loved the style of Steins Gate. I can‚Äôt quite describe it in words, but something about the style and animation used for this series is beautiful. The character designs (for the most part) are excellent and the soft tones keep it easy on the eyes.
Voice acting for this series was great as well. I don‚Äôt really have much to say about that. The soundtrack, openings and endings were all very well made and pleasant to listen to.
Now the cons:
The biggest problem I have with this show are the characters. The love for Okabe is so unreasonable, and I just don‚Äôt understand why so many people love him. He is without a doubt, the MOST ANNOYING character in anime history (behind Nina from Code Geass, Gabi from Attack on Titan, and Asuka from Evangelion). My very first impression of him was as if he was a 6 year old who just stuffed his face with Halloween candy and went on a massive sugar crash. He‚Äôs a human symbol for ADHD on steroids. 
Then comes his derpy, pervert otaku friend who takes every chance at ogling Makise. Such a forgettable character, I already forgot his name. 
That being said, the only sensible character I came to like was Makise. Beautiful, fierce, and intelligent. Can‚Äôt ask for much more. Mayuri was adorable and one of my favorites, but too bad her character was so damn submissive and unrealistic.
The story takes way too damn long in the beginning. The very first episode was confusing, which is what pushed me onto the second episode. From there on out to the next 4-5 episodes, it was agonizing and dreadful. It was so hard to keep my eyes open because it was so insanely slow and boring. To make things worse, Okabe‚Äôs hyper character only pissed me off and made me not want to watch it.   
Overall
Even though I despised the story in the very beginning, I gradually began to see it unfold at an easy going pace. I won‚Äôt deny that it was a fantastic story by the end of the series. My problem was that it took way too long for me to even gain the smallest amount of interest. Peer pressure and the insanely good reviews are what kept me going through this series to the very end.
Time travel is not an easy subject to put on screen. That being said, I believe Steins Gate did a pretty fair job. Only a handful of characters were memorable, meanwhile most of them were so annoying, I can‚Äôt even stomach looking at them anymore.
Was a terrible show? Absolutely not. Does it deserve the high rating it has? In my opinion, it really isn‚Äôt anything special. Very forgettable and not very intriguing. Hard to recommend it to anybody.",5

                So this is my first review. Please don't judge too hard. Tell me what you liked about it and what I can do to improve plz and ty.
Steins;Gate is one of (currently) 3 anime in the Science Adventure series. The story follows Okabe Rintarou, a mad scientist who works in the ""Future Gadget Lab"" which is basically just a room he's renting on top of a shop.
Story 10/10: 
The story of Steins;Gate was written very well with everything planned to keep the tension and suspense. The story mainly consists of Okabe Rintarou traveling through time to all these things from happening which all comes together
                  at the end and really gives you a feel of satisfaction.
Art 9/10:
The art in Steins;Gate has a unique style to it which differentiates it from other anime. The use of darker colours in the openings as well as some scenes in the anime really set the mood and lets viewers relate to the story more.
Sound 9/10:
The music and sound effects in Steins;Gate are dark, suspenseful and unique. The OST in this anime was really well written which is crucial to a story-heavy anime like Steins;Gate. The music and sound effects were also used at the appropriate times to emphasise any part of the story.
Characters 9/10:
The characters in Steins;Gate are all unique. Each one of them has been designed to look different, act different and have a unique backstory. The variety of personalities and physical appearances in Steins;Gate really contributes to its quality and its enjoyment.
Enjoyment 10/10:
Steins;Gate is an extremely enjoyable anime that hooked me with the first episode. Every episode after that was suspenseful and always left me with a feeling of wanting more. It often kept me up until 1-2 am just so I could watch the next episode.
Overall 9/10:
Overall, Steins;Gate was a very enjoyable anime that earned its spot on my favourites list. The story was very well written and was backed up by an original art style, well written music/sound effects and a unique cast of characters.",9

                Others calling it a masterpiece seems a little farfetched for me. First 11 episodes were EXTREMELY boring that Id forgotten I was watching the show. Yeah I get it, it got better. Very unexpected plot twist, kaboom. But it stands that the hook should be in the first episodes, not in the middle, nor the last. 
My main problem was the pacing, and the mood used. For the first 11 eps ive said, it had this happy theme, where the watcher is left confused about wtf is going on. Then after comes only dread and despair. It was too painful for me to continue. The
                  characters were entertaining at times, but not enough to the point that motivated me to keep watching. I was pulled by the curiosity of when the nightmare will end, not by when will they be happy. A me problem, I know. Still, I will stay by the side that the pacing and atmosphere placement is dogshit.
I watched the second season, but I didnt look forward to it. Had to drop it. Then again, its my opinion. Who knows. Might be your treasure.",5
"
                The story of this anime is definitely a thrilling experience.  If you like the idea of time-travel this anime does it in a unique way.  Overall, the story was fantastic, and it had great pacing. I also have to give credit that this story has a beggining, middle, and ending which makes a complete show.
The art was pretty good.  The art style is distinct from most anime.  The sound was pretty good also.  The opening, ending, and background music was pretty consistant in quality.
The best part of this show is definitely the characters.  All characters in this anime were
                  pretty interesting.  They do not follow any common archtypes.  The main lead Okabe was an exceptional mc that made this anime really great.  
Finally the I found this show to be incredibly entertaining.  It is a excellent anime that is incredibly memorable.  Overall, this anime recieves a 10 from me due to the incredible characters and unique story.  If you are a fan of sci-fi or find science interesting it is definitely worth watching.  It is a experience that is likely to be unforgetable.",10

                Time travel. A complex and risky theme to explore for any medium. Be it in movies, television or books. It can also make for the some of the most exciting and thought provoking stories ever devised. That being said, it can be very easy to get wrong. Most of the time it can get rather confusing and complex, with plot holes appearing all over the place and inconsistencies cropping up every so often. So when I sat down to watch the 2011 anime, Steins; Gate, I was a little concerned at how they would handle the subject matter. A show thats main plot device is
                  the act of time travel itself, and the consequences that follow it.
The show takes place in Tokyo in the year 2010 and centers around Rintarou Okabe. A self proclaimed 'mad scientist' who often refers to himself by the name of Hououin Kyouma. He lives in a beat down little apartment in the Akihabara district where he dedicates his time to creating what he calls 'future gadgets' along with his fellow lab memebers. Mayuri Shiina, his happy and sometimes air headed friend, and also Hashida Itaru, the resident hacker and perverted otaku. Also known as Daru. Their prize experiment that they are currently working on is a modified microwave that they have been using to morph cut up pieces of a banana  back into their original state. All be it covered in green goo. The real potential of this contraption is not revealed until Okabe witnesses a dreadful crime to which he then sends Daru a text message detailing what he just saw, only to then realize that after he did so, the event seemingly never never occurred and that the message he sent was received a full week before. At this point it would seem that Okabe has made a scientific breakthrough in the fact that the microwave, when connected to a phone, can send messages into the past.
This discovery helps Okabe in his fight against an evil organisation called SERN. An illusive entity that no one is sure actually exists. Further adding to the 'mad scientist' persona.  I have seen many express their views on how they believe the first act of the show to be quite slow. As much as I can agree in a way, as nothing too exiting really happens during these first 9 or so episodes, I felt that the characterization was so good that I hardly noticed  the lack of progression. After the 9th episode though, the show really comes into its own. With the story firing into overdrive with crippling revelations, small action sequences and downright tear worthy scenes making for some of the most gripping storytelling I've seen.
The actual act of time travel in this is handled extremely well. One particular part of the story features dozens of time jumps. Usually when this type of thing occurs I lose track of what is going on with so many different realities and scenarios happening all at the same time. In this however, I found all of the jumps to be simple enough in theory to always be able to follow what was going on at any one time without any confusion.
The only small setback in terms of story that I can comment on is the ending. I personally liked the ending quite a bit, however it still felt a bit like it was a little too convenient and well rounded. Although saying that it did fit together nicely and made sense in terms of the laws of time travel presented in this particular setting. I could feel this way because I'm not used to anime ending in the way I would like and it's a little weird for a show that was this tense and sometimes very dark to end in such a way. The overall story though is very well done, and is even better when you look at the characters.
Okabe, is one the most entertaining, charismatic and likable characters that I've seen in a show. He clicked instantly with me and I was on board from then on. His wit, charm and intellect make for an effortless watch. The supporting cast are also brilliant. Each one is written is such a way that you will find at least one that you can relate to. Plus the way each one of them plays off Okabe and each other gives the feeling that none of these are throw away characters put in for no reason. Everyone has a purpose. The variety here is top notch. You have Makise Kurisu (one of my personal favorites) the tsundere and rival scientist and of course Daru and Mayuri, plus a whole bunch of others who make their way into the story at various points.
The development of these characters is a bit of a weird area because there really isn't that much. This, however is not a problem at all, as we are given enough information and little snippets about their lives to keep a high level of interest. All of the charterers motivations and goals are made clear from the start or at least revealed later on in the story. This a very much 'in the moment show' with little need for tonnes of backstory, which I feel actually makes for an easier viewing experience.
I find the art style and animation of the show to be quite interesting. In the sense that it has a gritty realistic look to it that I wasn't expecting. Everything looked great but had this overhanging look of realism and not much of a fictional look to it. The colour palette is rather dull, but it works well for this setting. The opening animation is also one of the best I've seen.
The music, while good, I feel could have been played up a little more and used in more scenes. Alot of the time it felt like it was holding back  with quite a minimalist feel. When it was used to full effect though it was marvelous. The opening theme 'Hacking To The Gate' is brilliant and was actually one of the first signs I had of the show being awesome. I finished the show a few weeks ago and i'm still humming the song from time to time. If you are interested the shows music was done by Jun Murakami  and Takeshi Abo.
The dub for this show is also one of the best I have ever heard, with John Michael Tatum giving one of his best performances to date as our main character. Even all of the supporting cast were amazing. Not once did I feel that the show would be better subbed, although i'm sure that it is just as good.
Overall Steins; Gate is a wonderfully written fleshed out science fiction story with a great sense of style and dark comedy. The art is great, the sound is good, the dub is incredible and each episode left me wanting more, to which it certainly delivered. It is for this reason that I am going to give it a 10/10. There is no such thing as a perfect anime with no flaws, however, the very small issues I had with this show were very  nit picky and close to non-existent and did not change the amount of joy I experienced watching this show.",10
"
                Steins Gate is my personal second favorite anime of all time and I'd give it the highest possible recommendation. While I can be objective and nitpick at things that were imperfect, which I don't feel there were too many of, the show is, flat out, a masterpiece and one of the greatest anime series ever created.
Art-
I feel the art and animation here are top notch. It's never not smooth, the camera tricks are executed perfectly and there are several visually stunning moments implemented at appropriate times. You won't be dazzled particularly often but that's not what the show is going for, as this is a
                  show about science and technology as opposed to magic and other fantasy elements. Its presentation works perfectly for the story it tells.
Sound-
The voice acting in the dub is top notch. Industry veterans with revered reputations including J Michael Tatum, Trina Nishimura, Brina Palencia and Christopher Sabat are all present and deliver, as usual, excellent performances. This is largely an all star cast and the quality here is undeniable. Likewise the sound effects and background noise is excellent and perfectly fitting for their respective scenes.
The soundtrack is one of only two areas where I could objectively fault Steins Gate. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it whatsoever. However, in an anime where damn near everything else is a 10/10, the soundtrack simply isn't. It was good. It was solid. It had no bad pieces. BUT, it doesn't have a standout piece either. The soundtrack in Steins Gate was used as a supporting element, not a standalone one.
Character-
Characters and story are the bread and butter of Steins Gate. This anime is oozing with charm and likability, has intelligent humor and subtle real-world references around every corner and is simply incredibly intelligently penned. The more of the references you understand the more you'll like the show. Steins Gate referenced, parodied and implemented real-world references over and over again absolutely flawlessly and no anime I have ever seen has done this better. The lead is super likable, as is every single main cast member, and it's really hard to not be charmed by the characters themselves as well as their interactions with each other.
The second thing an objective person could use as a strike against Steins Gate, though I personally was not bothered by this, is flawed pacing. It's really hard to describe exactly why this occurs without spoilers. Keeping it intentionally vague, the show does something truly unique that I've never seen any other anime do in that it largely, for all intents and purposes, switches up its pace at a certain point to such an extent that one could argue the anime nearly switches genres entirely. Personally, I thought this was unbelievably awesome and extremely memorable. That said, one part of the show is much, much faster paced and more intense than the other part of the show and if you're looking for things to nitpick, voila!
Enjoyment-
If you've read my review up to this point you know I really, really, really enjoyed Steins Gate. As I stated in the opening paragraph, this is my second favorite anime of all time and I adored this show top to bottom and view it as a largely perfect masterpiece. I'd give it the highest possible recommendation to anyone who appreciates high quality or anyone even vaguely interested in science-fiction anime.
Overall-
Charming, thrilling, incredibly intelligent... This is my second favorite anime of all time and in my opinion one of the top ten if not top five overall best anime series ever created. An absolute masterpiece and an absolute must watch. AMAZING!
+Charm and humor for days
+Extremely likable characters that you'll care about
+Truly unique among anime in multiple ways, which is extremely difficult to do. There is nothing quite like Steins Gate.
+All star voice cast
+Excellent story, which is wrapped up perfectly and has no unanswered questions
-ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

                Let me start off by saying: This is my all-time favorite anime, it's the show that got me really into watching anime. I might not have become a weeb if it weren't for this shows existence (is that a good or bad thing lol).
Steins;Gate is a masterfully crafted techno-drama focusing on time travel. It has the most interesting time-travel mechanics I have ever seen in any medium. The main character, mad scientist and labmem 001 Hououin Kyouma (aka Okabe Rintarou) Has a special power which lets him keep his memories from events that happened in different timelines, making him essential for the main cast's time-machine
                  experimentation. His role in the second half of the story (shit hits the fan) is even more prominent.
Steins;Gate is a beautiful story filled with drama, suffering, comedy, romance and friendship. I have watched this series around 10-15 times since it came out and I'm currently watching Steins;Gate 0.
Tl;dr: If you like sci-fi, romance, drama or if you're looking for ""objectively good"" anime, watch this show. If you like all of the above, WATCH IT NOW!",10
"
                So, sooner or later, you're going to find an anime that seems as if it were made just for you. Steins;Gate was that anime for me, but I don't think I'm the only one that will think about Steins;Gate that way. It‚Äôs an anime that has a lot of things going for it. It‚Äôs funny, thrilling, and even romantic. But there is one word that I think sums it up better than any other: smart.
I think a good anime to compare Steins;Gate to is Death Note. The reason why I would do so is because after you've been watching both shows for a bit, you'll
                  have a nagging feeling of wanting to know what happens next. However, Death Note spends the whole show moving in one direction. After a while of doing so, it runs out of room and stops. It then struggles to get moving again, and ends on a note that is much less than perfect.
As you probably know, the main theme of Steins;Gate is time travel. And yes, it's a complex and brilliant concept of time travel that has a bunch of smart science stuff and blah blah blah. Yeah, most people think the show is super great just because it expands on these complex ideas. Having these ideas in Steins;Gate doesn't make the show great. I can go on Wikipedia and read as many time travel theories as I want. But the way Steins;Gate puts them into practice is where the show proves to be truly brilliant.
A lot of anime contain at least some filler. After watching Steins;Gate twice, I feel comfortable saying that every little thing you see happening on the screen is important. Seriously. There are even little details in the first episode that come back around twenty-two episodes later that directly impact the story line. Also, every dialogue on the screen between supporting characters is necessary for their development. It's also a big plus that there is not a single character in the show that is there just to be there. Look around the anime community to find comic relief characters that do little more than act as a punching bag. No such character is in Steins;Gate.
Now, about the characters. I do have a slight problem with the small cast of Steins;Gate. There are only about eleven or twelve characters that make any difference throughout the series. And that's including a few that are only in two or three episodes. Steins;Gate is centered on the eight characters you see in the opening sequence. Also, there is very little backstory given for any of them. However, everyone gets plenty of time on the screen. You see their personalities flesh out, and that's enough to get attached to everyone in the main cast.   
Going back to what I was saying about Steins;Gate being a ""smart"" show, properly utilizing the complex theories of time travel seen was a very impressive feat. Talking about it too much will start to spoil things. I assure you though, Steins;Gate has a massive amount of things to worry about all the time, and it deals with such things appropriately. There are stories where the author pulls things out of his proverbial butt for a while until the end is foreseen, and there are the stories where the author knows the ending before the writing the beginning. Steins;Gate is a story of the latter category. 
Going into some logistics, the sound and art in the show is just fine. There isn't any kind of super catchy song (except for the opening theme), but here and there, the audio really shines. For example, when the characters are outside, you'll often here the buzzing of dragonflies to create a feeling of tension. I also have to give a shout out to the voice actors, as I think they sound exactly like the people on the screen (I watched the dub btw). Now with visuals, I think Steins;Gate has fantastic cinematography. Brilliant shading and lights, as well as shifts to 3D are some examples. There is also this funky thing that happens several times that reminds me of Lelouch using his geass, if you know what I mean.
Now, I'm sure you have heard that the main problem with Steins;Gate is that it takes a while to get going. I don't agree with this at all. I prefer saying that after somewhere between 9-12 episodes, there is a dramatic shift in pacing. We get less dialogue and character development and more thrills and problems to solve. I still stand by what I said about everything in the show being necessary. If Steins;Gate didn't develop the beginning enough, it could have put it's ending in jeopardy. 
The last thing I will say about Steins;Gate is that I think it has something for everyone, especially if you have a taste for Sci-Fi. If you don't have one, this show might be what you need to get one! Anyway, there are scenes with thrilling chases, characters solving big mysteries, as well as the characters having hilarious dialogues. And if you're like me, you'll enjoy the romantic subplot in the show from beginning to end. 
Steins;Gate is a must watch for any anime fan, and you will likely enjoy it as much as I have.",10
"
                Additional ranking:consistency:10(I have enjoyed every episode of the anime even when im rewatching,unlike other anime which starts getting boring at the end like fate zero)
I personally feels that this anime is the best anime,there is no other anime that is nearly on par with this.
Story:Steins gate is a perfect combination of a spice of life in the beginning (Okabe and Mayuri's interaction in the beginning was really fun to watch) and taking a serious turn at the end.
Character:All the characters are unique,such as okabe has chunibyo,mayuri's tuturu(favourite!) and christina tsundereness.
Enjoyment:One of the part i enjoyed was when they discussed the time machine theory,though fictional,it kind
                  of make me think about it constantly,somehow like a scientist.",10

                Steins;Gate
This has been my experience with the anime.
At first it wasn't that appealing to me, it was just an anime a friend gave to me that's been sitting in my harddrive for quite some time, it was very confusing at first, but when I got into the story, I suddenly got interested, they show you all sorts of characters and how each one is unique from the rest, each with their own story that will play a major role to the story. 
You get different views of the characters, you'll get happy when they're all together having fun, you'll be sad when a problem appears,
                  you'll get mad when someone ""touches you waifu""(it's a joke, don't burn my house down pls). and sometimes you feel like you just wanna go into the screen and give the characters a hug and say ""you can do it"" or just straight up punch someone you don't like.
The MC doesn't seem likeable at first, but in truth, he cares about every one of his ""Nakama"", he'll be there to help with their problems, but that's where things get crazy, when a problem gets solved you think ""this'll probably work"" and then a minor thing that you didn't expect suddenly shakes up the plot again, and you'll be left thinking ""the fu..."".
Overall this anime gave me a rollercoaster ride of emotions, and I give it a 9/10
P.S. this is my first review so please spare my arse.",8
"
                -Hello, it is me, I was too careless... the organization got me again! Need to think of something, fast. El Psy Congoroo.
-Kurisitina, as my assistent, I demand you to help me with this organization problem, I The Mad Scientist Hououin Kyouma, will break the monopoly of power in the future, so this is the choice of The Steins Gate!!
What to say about Steins Gate?! When I heared about it, people were hyping the anime so much... I had to see it, even though at first it didnt look promising, and has a matter of fact I got unhoked right after seeing the first 2 episodes,
                  and this was around January-February of this year. So after having finished a great row of great animes, I looked to Steins Gate on my PS3 folder and decided to give it another shoot, it isnt that I didnt liked what I saw at first, I just didnt have time to watch at first, and I focused on other stuff. So I was still expecting something great coming out of this anime! And I got more than what I had asked for. 
Normally I dont like OP and END much, most of them are crap, after I skipped Steins Gate OP a few times, I decided to watch it, because I was really getting into the anime... BANG!! What a wonderfull OP, and when I saw the lyrics version it just feeled so much like Steins Gate, the same goes for the END, these two fell like an extension of the emotions you experience before and after the episodes, and with very good dialogue, well done jokes, and the typical Okarin-Makise word's fights, I give the sound of this anime a 9!
As for the animation it is very well done, and I really like some uniqueness of it at this anime, the more you dwelve into it, the more you like it. For example the more I see this, the more I like how artisticly Makise Kurisu is done, it gives her a pretty unique style that is so cool IMO!! So a 9 for the Art.
At the first episodes, most of all the important characters will show up, it can be a bit of opportunity lost since you get to known all of them in such a narrow window of time, but fear not, it just scratched the surface, you will see them all from different angles and different ""times"" across these 24 episodes, so you will have opportunity to known them really deeper, and understand them, and liking them each time more, and as far as it goes, each one is a unique personality,! 
Truly Character's wise, this is one of the strongest points of the anime!! A 10 for the really great characters that keep you so engaged through so much time!
And at the end, after ""Steins Gate has made its decision "", after you see this beautiful, artistic and well written anime, so just have to get up and Clap alot. The Story nails it, it talks about complex things, it is complex, and still it isnt hard to understand (with so much time travel stuff), it makes sense and it truly shines, this anime is about Characters and Story, if I gave it a 10 (overall), it is because the story is really that great, a perfect 10! A very interesting plot, that you can only see it coming from some genious minds! 
There is twists, there is action, mistery, drama, romance and comedy! Everything the story needed it is there!! Nothing misplaced. In the end you feel like everything was well done and felt in place, I personally cant point a fault at this anime ( the beggining is slow paced for a reason that later, you just think, that was the right choice)!! 
A blockbuster anime, the enjoyment I had with it was so great, a 10 is it score, and a 10 overall. 
A must watch, a classic, one of my favs of all time, even if you dont like it as much as I liked, you will still say: DAMM this was a good anime!!!
I cant wait for the realease of the movie in Blu Ray (december 2013), which is the final epilogue, and certainly I will see this anime again, and I will love it even more!! (If that is possible... it is already at the peak!)

                **SPOILERS BELOW**
Steins;Gate was divided into two parts. The first 12 episodes served as an introduction to the characters, their relationships, their lifestyle/culture in general. It was a light-hearted and humorous story of an odd group that bonded thanks to a crazy mad scientist. Personally, I didn't enjoy most of the repetitive ""pervert"" humor in this part and other than Hououououin Kyouma, the characters didn't seem interesting or important. The side characters developed minimal relation with each other as the show focused more on Okabe and his relationships. I didn't enjoy the first part much but I was still curious to see where the plot was
                  headed. 
In the 2nd part, the tone started to change and things got more serious. As the characters faced difficulties we started to learn more about them even though the show continued to focus mostly on Okabe's perspective. I've seen many series/movies that tackle time travel and I can't recall any that showed the protagonist's point of view so well. Steins;Gate doesn't skip the dull/painful or repetitive moments that Okabe has to go through but instead it often embraces them and highlights them. I found the plot and pacing of this part refreshing, it was interesting to watch Okabe get serious and try to find his way through the mess. The contrast between the first and second part also helped elevate the seriousness at this stage. 
Even though I learned more about the side characters and their past at this stage, I just didn't find them that interesting. Especially the ""but he is a man"" girl just felt unnecessary throughout the show. Since we are on the subject, I don't understand how a sci-fi can get away with ""eating vegetables can change a baby's gender"" logic. I also didn't like how the entire time travel system was loosely based on fate. I have some other problems with the concept but time travelling cannot be ""realistic"" after all and they managed to create an interesting story based on their own rules so I respect that. 
Back to the characters, I also didn't like how most of the cast somehow fell in love with Okabe. I understand his relationship with Kurisu and Mayuri but I felt like the others blossomed out of nowhere because.. plot? Surely they didn't all have to confess their love and cry dramatically to show their appreciation. 
Finally, the animation didn't bother me but it was no eye candy either. I found the main bittersweet song (Gate of Steiner) very beautiful but other than that the soundtrack was just mediocre. They must have realized that too because that song ended up being played too often in my opinion. The voice acting felt overly dramatic at times but was solid otherwise. Also props to whoever voiced Mayuri, you'd expect her to be annoying after a while but nope! ""Tutturuu!"" is still super cute. 
Overall, I think S;G has an interesting plot that feels complete and a colorful main character. It is worth watching but honestly I don't see why it's considered a masterpiece.",6

                ""It's the choice of Steins Gate.""
 Story: 10/10
 The story of Steins;Gate is a unique and detailed time travel story, it starts as a relatively slow-paced show, however, it is this initial slow pace that introduces and explores the various characters of the series. This plays to excellent effect in the later episodes while exploring the characters in depth. The initial episodes also create a mysterious atmosphere that enables the perfect execution of a brilliantly made ending. Overall the plot is highly consistent with itself with barely any Deus Ex Machina.
 Art: 9/10
 I can only describe the art of Steins;Gate as dull and monotonous.
                  However, this anime has proven to me that these need not necessarily be negative traits. In the later episodes, it blends well with the overall gloomy atmosphere of the plot. The characters are well detailed and very distinctly portrayed. This creates a very realistic feel of the characters and settings, something very uncommon with regards to anime in general.
 Sound: 8/10
 I have watched both the English Dub as well as the Japanese VA. Though I have just a few complaints about the English Dub, I felt that the Japanese VA better fits the theme and setting of the plot. The Japanese VA is simply excellent and provides far greater depth to the story. The best part of the sound execution is the well-timed BGM (the ED in particular) with various crucial moments in the plot.
 Character: 10/10
 The greatest part to me was the characters and their development as the story progressed. I found every single character (even the minor characters) relate-able on a deeply personal level. Such a realistic response to various events coupled with very real personalities made them all inherently very likable. I can say that these charterers have made a profound self-analysis of myself with their various thoughts throughout the series.
 Enjoyment: 10/10
 Steins;Gate is among the very few anime that I recommend to almost everyone I know. My family watched this show together they all simply loved it. It also carries extremely high re-watch value (I have already watched it 4 times at the time of writing this review) and has the potential to reveal something which was possibly missed on the last watch. 
 I conclude that this series is what lay the foundation for my interest in anime in general and the hope to find a show of a similar caliber.
 Overall: 10/10

                After watching Steins;Gate, I can't help but to write a review. 10's across the board, easily.
TL;DR: DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS ANIME. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT.
Story: 10/10. This story is, essentially about time travel. A time machine is created, and repercussions are seen as the main character, Okabe, continues to discover its wonders and devastations. As a fan of Doctor Who, I had high expectations of what would come out of this show. Time machines and time warps have been done over and over, so I was a little skeptical when it came to Steins;Gate. However, as my score indiciates, I was
                  not disappointed. This story itself is unique and beautifully written. The plot comes to a full circle at the end - what you saw in the beginning with come back and hit you like a tornado by the last episode. It's very original and refreshing, and Steins;Gate is an anime that really impressed me. A majority of people who watches this show would say that the first few 12 episodes were a little boring, and that the plot really takes off at the end of episode 12. The series does do a sort of 180 at around that time. I, however, found Steins;Gate fascinating from episode 1. It really depends on personal preference, though. Either way, it's an anime that you should NOT miss out on.
Art: 10/10. What can I say? The art is beautiful and detailed. From the opening credits to the end theme, not a single brush stroke was missed. Each character is given their own look, very distinguishable from one another. The colors are vibrant, especially when Okabe moves from one world line to another (you'll understand once you start the first few episodes). 
Sound: 10/10. Ehh, this is where my review will fall a little short. I'm never one to pay any attention to sound, but when I do, the sounds fit the tone of the scene. During the sad scenes, the sound really moves you. That's all I can say really, sorry about that!
Character: 10/10. I don't even know where to begin with the characters. Okabe, the main character, is eccentric and incredibly intelligent, despite what his actions may lead you to believe. He's unlike any main character I've ever seen before. I know it's of personal reference - some people end up hating the guy - but I loved him right off the bat. He puts his friends first before himself, and he's always striving for the gain of knowledge. He has a childhood friend named Mayushi who we see a lot during the series as well. She's the kawaii, care-free girl that keeps Okabe grounded. Even though she's a little bit scatter-brain (or appears to be), she essentially keeps Okabe grounded in a way that brings him back to reality whenever he wanders off too far in his mind. Hashida is the perverted friend, but who's also a hacker genius. He may seem like a couch potato, but he's full of life and ideas that contribute to the plot. I could spend another hour talking about characters, but the main point is that each and every character has their own personality and unique contribution to the plot. There isn't one empty character on this show.
Enjoyment: I gave this show a 10/10. I obviously enjoyed it. JUST GO WATCH IT OKAY IT'S NOT EVEN A 10 HOUR MARATHON.",10

                Stein's Gate is the kind of show that's so good, it has the potential to turn someone into an avid anime fan. How can I say this with such confidence? 
It happened to me. 
I would go as far as to say that I have an incredibly hard time believing that I will ever see another anime that will be hands down better than Stein's Gate. From the plot, to the art, to the music, to the character development, Stein's Gate is missing absolutely nothing. I mean cmon, even the dub is amazing. You know an anime is one for the ages when even the
                  dubbed version is off the charts good. 
Time travel is a tricky subect to tackle. It's so easy to lose your viewers in a convoluted plot that you rarely see them done well. Stein's Gate is the poster child for this genre. It gives you enough details that you believe in the premise and characters, but not so much that the show becomes lost in a mountain of unneccessary details.
There's just something about Okabe that makes him..... amazing. This is actually one of the very few shows that I like watching is English more than Japanese. If for no other reason, watch this show for J. Michael Tatum's portrayal of Okabe. Absolutely fantastic voice acting for the role.
The art in Stein's Gate fit the story amazingly as well. It gave off a sort of ominous and bleak feeling at times, but also had moments were it brightened up and felt more energentic and alive. The beautiful contrast between these two extremes did wonders for forshadowing events later on in the story.
I absolutely loved the size of the cast. The fairly large number of main characters allowed for a vareity of friendly banter amongst characters, and allowed for a variety of interesting character developments without compromising the progression of the plot.
A final note on the plot and it's pacing.... some of the best of both I've ever seen in any show, anime or not. In 24 episodes, Stein's Gate will take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotion that fit together really well.  
Stein's Gate will make you laugh. Stein's Gate will tug at your heart strings. Stein's Gate will show you just how amazing an anime can be. 
Highly recommend. A must watch for everyone who's a fan of anime in general.",10

                Ever wondered what you would do if you were given a time machine? Like, say, win a lottery, or eat a thousand ice creams and whatnot. I assume most of the people to just jump on the time machine when the opportunity presents itself. But, have we thought about how things 'might' turn out, two steps ahead of time?
Simply put, Steins;Gate is about time travelling, and its' effects/consequences. It follows the (mis)adventures of Okabe Rintarou and his 'lab'. Okabe is such an eccentric bastard that you can't help but like him. His self-proclaimed secretary, Makise Kurisu, does most of the work though. As the story
                  unfolds, mysteries become clearer, emotions run wild, all the while engaging the viewer into a deeper understanding of our human nature. (With a time machine, would you correct a mistake, even though you 'fully' understand the consequences?)
The pacing is a bit slow through the first couple of episodes, but, believe me, it goes by so fast about halfway through, that you'd be surprised that ~20 mins. passed by already. The art is great, though nothing stood out for me. The sound is about perfect; from the opening theme to the sound of cicadas to the outside world, and various others. I believe it fit well with what the series conveys. Character development is such a huge factor on why I like this series so much. (Especially the development of our dear main character)
Unforgettable series, to say the least. I remember disliking Moeka (minor char, major contribution to the plot) so much during my first run at it. It's just one of those animes that makes you think of 'what if's.",10
"
                 The concept and the premise were very interesting, but then the plotholes started coming and the fact that the characters were very shallow and just walking cliches was evident. The mad scientist (the only one that was interesting), a fat perverted nerd, a textbook tsundere, a 18 year old girl that acts like a 6 year old (why?), and other characters were even worse, their only characterization was a single trait, for example being a guy that wants to be a girl, or talking like a cat. And the worse one was probably the shy annoying girl that only speaks through text messages.
 The
                  journey of the MC was interesting, even if at some point it stopped making any resemblance of logical sense, but in the end the anime was just mediocre.",5
"
                This is truly my favorite anime series of all time. 
I found something likeable about every character.
Okarin, AKA Okabe Rintarou, the mad scientist addicted to Dr. Pepper, is always hilarious, and in the second half of the series, just overall awesome.
Mayuri Shiina, the cutesy girl who has no idea what's going on but goes along with it.
Daru... kinda reminds me of myself, in the otaku-y, moe loving way.
Suzuha, just plain badass.
Feyris, her voice bothered me abit, but other then that, she was a really sweet character.
Ruka, an adorable TRAP.
Kurisu, the cool tsundere.
Kiryuu, a character who is lonely in the way that you feel bad for
                  them and want to huggle them very badly.
I couldn't imagine their voices anyway else, they were perfect, even if Feyris's voice did sound like a drunk chipmunk.
The story starts off in a very relaxing, funny anime, and then turns very serious and dark, and I like when anime have two different sides.
Truly an anime everyone should watch.
Thanks for reading!",10

                Steins; Gate is one of those rare animes that can explain time travel without falling to the many plot holes that could be created from the concept. An anime that seems light-hearted at first transforms into an intense sci-fi thriller that you will never forget. 
STORY: The story is pretty simple as far as it goes -- Okabe rintarou, his childhood friend Mayuri Shiina and the self-proclaimed  'supah hackah' Itaru Hashida. They all come together to form the future gadget research lab, although the actual gadgets are less than interesting; the only thing that sparks the viewers interest is the ""phone microwave"" (name subject
                  to change) that turns the object inside of it into a green jelly. They soon find out that the phone microwave can send messages into the past, altering the structure of time. 
The story is pretty good as far as it goes. There were no plot holes. (or atleast obvious ones.) Although the first arc is more so to build up your relationships with the characters, this is contrasted by the fast-paced second arc, when the psychological genre finally comes into play. I almost dropped the anime at the first arc, and I am glad I didn't, the second arc kept me hooked and at the edge of my seat. 
ART: The art is satisfactory, nothing outstanding nor bad. The characters and backgrounds have decent detail. Nothing more to be said here.
SOUND: The music was perfect; the opening fits the anime perfectly. None of the characters' voices were annoying or anything like that. 
CHARACTERS: This is one of the aspects that Steins; Gate shines the most in. The characters are well fleshed out and have interesting personalities. Okabe Rintarou is a ""mad scientist"" who is a firm believer in a person called ""John Titor"" who was rumoured to have come from the future where an evil organizatio known as SERN has taken over the world.  Makise Kurisu, your ordinary tsundere. Itaru Hashida, your perverted genius otaku friend. I loved the sense of badass-ery that Suzuya created, and that she progresses from a  supporting character to a main. Rukako/Rumiho were the least... assertive characters, it seemed as if they were just there for filler content.
Enjoyment: 10.
Overall: 10

                [Spoiler Warning] 
Many people are turned off by the slice of life part of the show, to which i disagree. The earlier episodes aren't as slow as many people claim them to be 
 There was always a grim dark theme looming somewhere as early as ep 1 when Kurisu died. And there was always a threat of the Butterfly Effect changing the very reality that Okabe knows. Okabe started realising the consequences of time travelling as early as episode 7 or 8.  
There was always a threat with SERN and the Rounders sending those death threats to Okabe. The Jellyman reports were clear
                  indication that they are up against a vicious and malevolent organisation.
There was always a sense of mystery to keep you engage. Why TF does Suzuha seem like she came from some kind of War time? What happened to the IBN? What happened in the 1st episode? What were the Dmails that the Labmems sent that could alter reality so greatly? Who is John Titor?
There was always something happening each episode. Each episode we learn something new about either SERN, time travelling , the IBN or even the characters.  Each episode, we're closer to uncovering most of the mysteries laid out. 
I had a blast trying to piece together every odd details and how they explain the mysteries that had been laid out. Like why is this Part timer acting like she's from another time? Does she buy into the time travel just to go a long or is it because she's seen time travelling before? Why does she say that she know what Kurisu will do?Why is she so interested in John Titor as well? Is she a fan of John titor?
If anything i would say the plot around when Okabe kept rewinding time to save Mayuri was the slowest, coming to a complete halt. That is not to say it makes the show bad. In fact, the varying pacing  of the anime is, imo, what made it such a masterpiece. The earlier episodes advance the plot at pretty much the same pace at the later episodes.  There are more joke and slice of life dialogues as compared to Okabe moping and Kurisu comforting him. Neither advances the plot but they both expand on the characters . In the earlier episodes, we learn more about SERN and the principle of time travelling while in the later episodes, we learn more about the Labmems. We only feel that the earlier episodes are slower because of the directions of those episodes. The earlier episodes set a more light heart/slice of life tone so we feel that they're slow. The later episodes put us in suspense, hit us with feel trains, so they seem faster. The later episodes had more cuts whereas each scene in the earlier episodes lasted longer. In the earlier episodes, the plot advances but it is not Okabe that actively tried to seek out the answers to the mysteries(okabe was just going with the flow) whereas in the later episodes, Okabe was going everywhere to find an answer, to bend the flow(of time) 
Its just as Kurisu said ""Whether time passes slowly or quickly depends on perception"". And i think this is all intentional by the creators,too.  The pacing seemed slow through Okabe perception as well  because he was mostly doing experimentations and building the equipments. In the later episodes, Okabe was desperate,  he felt like he was out of time(to save Mayuri) so it is only natural that he would see time passed through much quicker. From a story telling standpoint, the ""slower"" pace made us attached to the characters(which is pivotal because of how character driven this show is). The ""faster"" pace helped built tension and climaxes. The fact that our ""pacing"" and Okabe's ""pacing"" sync up really put us in the shoes of Okabe, which again, is pivotal in a show so character driven.Ôªø",10

It's me.
In an effort to escape the onslaught of the Organisation, I have time leapt to this time to enjoy the fireworks of the New Year, as well as to write a review.
Steins;Gate is pretty fucking awesome.
Originally a visual novel game for the xBox360, Steins;Gate easily becomes one of the most popular anime due to its unique qualities. Like many other animes which were derived from visual novels, its selling point is its unique and creative storyline. 
Basically, you have a self-proclaimed mad scientist who stumbles upon a time machine that is capable of sending messages into the future. Accompanied by a cute ditzy girl and an otaku/super haker, they form the Future Gadget Research Establishment and perform various experiments out of curiosity. The number of members increase as the story moves on.
 Steins;Gate has a story built upon suspense and twists, and that is exactly what I loved about it. It keeps me guessing all the way, from episode 1 to 24. Various hypothesis and theories keep popping in my head like popcorn. However, this does not mean that Steins;Gate have a confusing story. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Steins;Gate is so interesting that I was completely absorbed into the story and I go ""OMG"" everytime something is revealed. Other than the intense 'MOMENT OF TRUTH' scenes, the anime constantly switches to its light-hearted slice of life storyline which usually have me laughing myself off the seat.
The voice acting is top-notch. The voice actor of Okabe truly outdone himself. I get the shivers every time I hear him say ""El Psy Congroo"". Also, we have the cute voice of Mayuri going ""Tutturoo~"" and Kurise's tsundere voice. Absolute euphoria. As far as the sound goes in the anime, I can mostly only hear cicadas crying in the background, but it suits the setting of Akihabara damned well. Of course, later in the show there's this superb piano play which makes the scene very dramatic. I love the OP very much because of its high-tension beats. A fantastic opening for a fantastic anime.
Okabe Rin- I mean Hououin Kyouma is the most awesome dude in the whole anime. He is literally the life of the anime. Not once have I gotten tired of his 'outburst'. I can see why he's quite the ladies man. Steins;Gate would probably suck without him and he should have a book of his famous quotes published immediately.
The other characters are pretty lovable too, with all the girls being cute in their own way and Daru being a cool haker and all. I don't think I dislike any characters in Steins;Gate.
The art is perfect. Nuff' said.(or not apparently) It is almost impossible for me to fully convey how much I love the art of Steins;Gate, but i will try my best. Take a look at this emoticon :). Now compare it to the Mona Lisa potrait. This is how much better Steins;Gate is than other animes. Okay, too much exaggeration. But I will have you know that I love all the visuals in the anime. The characters are very well designed and somewhat original.(Well maybe Kurisu looks kind of like Hitagi from Bakemonogatari) Akihabara looks detailed and goes well with the cicada cries. It is on par with the beautiful Ikebukuro from Durarara! Then, shit gets real when the intense moments happens and the distinct difference with the peaceful days and the dark desperate scenes never fails to mesmerize me. Just when I thought ""Wow, the art is pretty good! Everything is detailed and sharp, the bright colors really tells the joyful mood"", everything turns dark and hazy as the unexpected happens. Somewhat nuff' said.
I thoroughly enjoyed the show because it keeps me guessing until the end and the comical daily lives of the characters keeps the anime interesting. I loved every second of Steins;Gate and I wish that everyone would watch it. It's an outstanding anime which deserves all the attention it is getting.

                In the past few years, there have been many anime titles that have made big names of themselves as some of the best to come in the industry. Whether it be Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Attack on Titan, or Madoka Magica. But if there's one anime title under the Sci-Fi genre that has been ranked right up there with said shows, it would be Steins;Gate. Never has there been a Sci Fi anime that's been so praised and beloved since Haruhi Suzumiya, and I'm here to talk why that's the case.
Story: We follow a college student named Rintarou Okabe, a self proclaimed mad scientist who plots
                  to take over the world in his apartment above a TV repair shop. Despite his weird personality, he actually has some friends who usually hang out with, a childhood friend named Mayuri Shiina and an otaku hacker named Itaru Hashida. The three of them form ""The Future Gadget Laboratory"". Where they mess around with electronics and usually listen to Okabe act like a raving lunatic. The story doesn't officially start when young genius Kurisu Makise takes an interest in their club and decides to join it, right when they discover that they made a time machine out of a cellphone and a microwave that can send text messages back in time. What follows is a suspenseful and thrilling drama with them using their time machine to figure out how it works and changing the past. All while learning the consequences when they get themselves involved in something that's the opposite of pleasant....and it's best I stop there.
Funny thing about this show is that it's part of a trilogy of stories that take place in the same universe but have nothing to do with each other. The prequel Chaos;Head was supposedly a flop and if the writers didn't improve on their mistakes, Steins;Gate would of crashed and burned. But thankfully that wasn't the case. The best thing about Steins;Gate, is that is somehow made a premise that sounds silly at first, and actually made it really engaging to watch. Plus, it really controls it's tone perfectly. It can be funny, it can be sad, it can be suspenseful, and it really keeps you on your toes from beginning to end. And despite it's comedy aspect, it also knows when to have drama. And when it's dramatic, words can't describe how great it is.
If there's one common complaint I here with it is that the first act is ""slow and boring"". Which I can understand, but I feel it's like that to have the story structure in tact. It's like that so you can get to know the characters more and grow emotional connections with them. That way you'll feel bad for them once the second half kicks in. And the characters are so enjoyable, that it makes the first few episodes worth watching.
Another thing I like to talk about is the show's in-genius take on time travel. Time Travel itself is a much more complicated concept than many people first assumed. When it comes to time travel stories, there are always plot holes in them no matter how good the story can be. Even classics like Back to the Future and Terminator 2 have plot holes if nitpicked hard enough. But with Steins;Gate, they made the theory that once you travel through time, you'll also go into a different world line where everything is mostly the same except for certain aspects. That makes the story more solid that it almost feels like there aren't any time travel plot holes. Oh there might be some in there somewhere, but it's so well executed, that it's hard to point them out.
Animation: I gotta say this animation really knows how to make it different from the rest of the shows. The animation really compliments the other great qualities of the show. From the scenes where they talk about time travel, to the more intense moments in the second and third half. Another thing I need to give them props for is their unique character design. It's looks more distinct from your standard generic anime style. Which is saying a lot since it's sister shows, Chaos;Head and Robotics;Notes, have the more familiar look that we're use to seeing.
Sound: Funny thing is, there isn't much music to this show. But the selective few music tracks, really stick to you and adds to the atmosphere that the show creates. And special props to Kanako Itou for singing such a great theme song that really sets the show's tone perfectly, getting you hyped for what you're about to watch. Plus, the voice acting's really good. J. Michael Tatum giving one of his greatest performances in Okabe. Plus, many of the other voice actors are ones we usually rarely hear compared to the select few regulars who still pull in great performances all the same.
Characters: Here we come to the second most important part to any show, the characters. Okabe is easily one of the most memorable and well written main characters in anime, and that's saying a lot in recent years. He's just so passionate about the world he's created that you can't help but want him to be right. And funny thing is, his personality can easily make him seem unlikable. But what keeps him from being that is his humanity. He really does cherish his friends and cares for them enough for him to not what anything bad happen to them. Plus, the journey he takes and the character development he experiences truly makes him well-defined, and truly helps give the show it's own identity.
Though as much as it pains me to say it, but the same can't really be said with the other characters. Now before you all click ""Not Helpful"", hear me out. You see, due to the constant time-traveling Okabe goes through, the supporting cast never really develop like our main hero. And the fact that most of the characters are female and there are only three guy characters in the cast, makes it obvious that it's based on a visual novel, which holds this cast of characters back by a hair. But does that make them terrible? Absolutely not. They're still lovable, they still have great personalities and back stories, and some even have very effective twists to them. I knew there would be twists to some of the characters, but I never knew how they would turn out. Another thing that makes the characters great, is their chemistry with one another. Mayuri is one of the most adorable and lovely girls I've ever seen, and you believe that she and Okabe go way back. Plus, Kurisu at first seems like your standard tsundere, but her inner depth and chemistry with Okabe really help define their interactions, despite mostly bicker. So, where the other character lack in development unlike our main one, it's the other qualities that make up for it.
Enjoyment/Overall: Steins;Gate is easily one of the best Sci-Fi show's I've ever seen. And I'm not just talking anime wise, I mean Sci-Fi in general. It has great characters, a smartly written story, a lot of humor and heart, it's a near masterpiece. If you just heard of this anime, do yourself a favor and check it out A.S.A.P.",9
"
                I decided to watch this after hearing so much about it.
Firstly, I was aware the start would be slow but I was not expecting it to be this bad. For someone who tends to watch shounens where there's regular action, I wasn't prepared for the slow paced slice of life I got in the first half. If it wasn't for the rave reviews I would have dropped it. What made it worst was that I didn't believe the anime got me the impression that something interesting was going to eventually happen, I was bored and left in the dark.
Then from episode 12 everything went up
                  10 notches. It was a rollercoaster of events I wasn't expecting. I remember some episodes leaving me with my mouth physically open, these were moments I wasn't expecting at all. 
I went from finding the protagonist rather irritating to enjoying his presence. Even the humour rubbed off by the end. What this anime excelled at was unravelling. The way everything started to fall apart then fall again into place piece by piece only for the writer to smash everything to bits was incredible. The last anime to leave me feeling this way was Death Note. If you are considering this, I recommend riding out the mind numbing beginning to see the endless twists and turns this story starts to show us.
On the other hand, it is important I highlight the flaws even with an incredible second half. The other lab members are uninteresting side characters who are just miniscule pawns in the grand scheme of things bar-2 or 3. Even when one was put in grave danger, I didn't care.  The world it is based in is paper thin, the atmosphere dry. It is not something you will enjoy looking at or experiencing.
Beside the aesthetics and side elements, this is a storytelling masterpiece that is worth experiencing. Especially if you're into Slice of Life, Time Travelling and Mystery.",7
"
                Although I am fairly new to the anime scene, I must say this: for those of you who have yet to find a promising story, I PROMISE you, this is the one. 
Okay. It does start off almost as a monologue of a supposed antihero whose main ideals lie not too far from the cuckoo's nest. I'd say intriguing for a start as this has come to be a proper way of fitting the audience into the shoes of Okabe Rintarou. The introduction of Okabe and his crew does seem to be quite a dash, lapping dialogues atop dialogues. However, the brief character backgrounds and
                  their sudden introductions are vital in setting the mood for informality in relationships alluding to a steadied plot point where characters can seem at ease to the audience; an ""act one"" of Innocence shyly portrayed. 
Despite an early mystery, the story will be driven slowly. Characters will appear seemingly without any means of care or reason only to be explained within various intervals in between several settings. The initial setting, Akihabara, will have already been at heart to the audience simply from sharp transitions of sceneries, which are beautiful in both art and mechanism - a storytelling of its own. 
Strap yourselves in patience and brace for the ride. The plot will literally unwind just as everything begin to seem fine and dandy. The audience will lose their hold on the sensible innocence and start to drift away from trivial matters of food shortages and character disputes. Yes, character disputes are a trivial matter, at least inter and not so much intra. The true matter at hand is to be realized with careful following as our antihero traverses across several timelines (though the mechanism is unclear, it is not necessary for driving the story forward). 
I can not emphasize just how important it is to fit oneself into the shoes of the protagonist while fully thinking apart. To be challenged against fate for the very purpose of finding its existence, to fill the emotional void at times when characters are left incapable of doing so only to love them even greatly, and to end an antihero's journey with questions answered not by taught wisdom but from an inner desire to view this experience as one of his or her own. 
These very interactions were what made watching Steins;Gate my own adventure.",10
"
                Story
taken into perspective that this anime was from a 2009 visual novel i should rate this anime as if its 2009-2011 where great animes of all time are being created. 
this anime has a very complex story that usually make a normal audience bored, but after ep 7-13, you probably making yourself a good favour by watching until the end, believe me, its worth it, the story is masterfully crafted that wont allow you to recover after watching every episode. 
Art
Unique art style, I love Mayuri and Makise's eyes art. Kyomas head art also lol. 
sound
listen to the opening. then listen to its english translation
                  by TYER, then after watching the last episode , listen again to the original op, then to the english translation, then read about the history of dark ages, now tell me its not great. 
Characters
everyone play a part in the anime, no one is left behind, even in the slightest detail. character development is also masterfully written too too roo
Enjoyment
this anime is not enjoyable, this anime is nerve wracking mind bending puzzle. *evil laugh*
Overall
Do yourself a favour and watch this now if you didnt watch it yet, the score only shows how great this masterpiece is, but the real rating is for you to decide after watching this.",10
"
                I hate myself for only watching what would become my all time favorite anime series just now. I was hearing about Steins;Gate the anime ever since it came out but I quickly judged it too soon when I saw a poster. It contained Okabe and all the girls so I prematurely dismissed it as a harem moe pandering series.
It's anything but that.
The subject of time travel is a difficult one to incorporate in a narrative perhaps mainly because the intended audience will likely attempt to find holes in the delivery of a plot focusing on one of humanity's most interesting concepts. Given this, I think
                  Steins;Gate approached it with just the right amount of sci-fi and drama and humor to make an amazing piece of Japanese animation.
Story - 10/10
The first episode got me hooked immediately. This series is not just about time travel. It's important to note the attention the studio took in crafting the relationships of the characters. Besides time, there is also a good amount of friendship, love and selflessness in Steins;Gate narrative to keep you hooked from start to finish. It's a good thing they decided to produce the OVA (that comes after the events of the last episode of the original series) because it delivered a much much better closure than the finale, not to say the finale was bad. All in all, I really loved the subject of time travel in this series' story. In a nutshell, it's like Terminator meets Back to the Future. Great fun and drama.
Art - 10/10
Consistent, just consistent. The animation was top class and you can tell the studio was not lazy when they made this. For the art style, I'm guessing the studio opted for a more accessible form since the style of the visual novel varies quite noticeably from the anime adaptation. Places are detailed, characters' reactions solid, there was even one part midway through the series when they adapted a different style of animation but only for a short while.
Sound - 10/10
The music was excellent. When watching with earphones/headphones, the times when the atmosphere was eerie and mysterious, you could hear the befitting musical accompaniment. There's a part in the series where an image is shown and the music jolts you. I was scared shitless by that scene. And damn did I love Mayuuri's voice, along with Daru's.
The greatness of the opening song is only matched by the ending theme. What's interesting is that in the last bunch of episodes, the viewer must mind the change in the lyrics of the opening song. It's catchy as hell and gets you really in the mood to watch Steins;Gate since the lyrics are tailor made for the story and themes.
Character - 10/10
This series has to have one of the best casts ever. My personal favorites are Suzuha Amane and Hashida ""Daru"" Itaru. Suzuha is just too cool. They didn't sexualize her into a moe girl or anything but they simply made her a joy to watch. Daru carries the comedic value of the show with his references to memes and his passion for otaku interests which is at the same time, funny and realistic. The protagonist is also well written. He's not an alpha male, I-have-a-hidden-power-that-can-beat-all-odds type of MC. He isn't even the smartest in the cast. What he is is human, like the rest of us and that's why I think the audience is able to insert themselves with ease. Rukako Urushibara is pretty unnecessary in my view but he's never annoying. Nobody in this show is annoying. Great cast!
Overall 
For anyone who is sick and tired of the same loli, moe pandering in recent anime series, I suggest you go and give Steins;Gate a viewing. I am almost completely certain the blend of drama, comedy and sci-fi in this incredible anime makes it one of the greatest of all time. El Psy Congroo.",10

                Awesome anime with a great and far different plot from the animes now a days. Can't wait for the movie.

                ill start with the negatives, because they are very few
it starts really slow. the first 5 episodes are confusing and the rest 10 episodes are slow. bbut then the epic emotional journey begins.
STORY  10 / 10 : the story is simple and confusing at the same time. what i mean is, they took a simple overused theme/story such as time travelling but they put many theories by real life existed scientists and they combined them and made a rather magnifisent theory using the butterfly effect to bring in the ""drama"" part of the anime. 
ART  8 / 10 : the art style is
                  unique, its really good, nothing too exciting, the animation is great and simple.
SOUND  9 / 10 : there arent many soundtracks but the 2 main ones (gate of steiner and believe me) are amazing outstanding overplayed ones. the ending song tho is magnificent 
CHARACTERS  9 / 10 : likable, UNIQUE, developed the way they sould be
ENJOYMENT  8 / 10 : at first boring but then i loved it (i even teared up a little :P ) 
VOICE ACTING  10 / 10 : AMAZING!!!!
OVERALL : 9 / 10",9

                With the recent boom of time travel anime, Steins;Gate was bound to rise in popularity, as the founder of this new mini genre. It had been a little over a year since I'd watched Steins;Gate, and seeing as I wasn't the biggest fan of Boku Dake ga Inai Machi I decided to rewatch Steins;Gate to see if it still lived up to my expectations. Unfortunately, it didn't. It went beyond them. 
One of the greatest feats of Steins;Gate is it's rewatchability. Perhaps the biggest complaint about Steins;Gate is that 'OMG THE FIRST HALF OF IT IS SOOOO BORING'. Actually, I can agree with that. It
                  was confusing and it WAS pretty boring. On the rewatch, though, my opinion changed drastically. Even watching through Steins;Gate a second time, knowing what happens, it feels like you're watching a remake, because you discover even more secrets and can appreciate easter eggs that Steins;Gate slips in to reference later events in the story. Moving past the first half, things here are what make the series what it is. The humor used in the previous episodes (Which is hysterical, by the way) is dwindled down to be replaced with more serious storytelling. Death, plot twists, and character development all arise, and the story goes down an intense path describing the risks and consequences of time manipulation. It's a titan of enjoyment, almost everything about it screams YES! And boy, did it pay off. Steins;Gate is easily one of the most popular anime to date, and it's popularity is only rising as of late. 
Unfortunately, Steins;Gate wasn't gifted with the mind-blowing animation of other popular series. Not that it's bad, per say, but it doesn't live up to the rest of the series. Or so I had initially thought. On the rewatch I discovered that watching with a more open mind showed how the animation really isn't as bad as first glance would like you to believe, and the art is quite incredible for a 2011 series. However, if you can't see it on the first run through, the chances of someone liking it enough to rewatch it decrease, so unfortunately this isn't really that much of an advantage. Regardless, the color pallette and creative character design make this a good looking show.
Now maybe I'm oversensitive to sound. Usually for me it's either a 10/10 or a 1/10, or at least relatively close to that. Maybe Steins;Gate's BEAUTIFULLY COMPOSED soundtrack isn't as good as I thought. 
.
.
.
Oh who am I kidding? Steins;Gate's soundtrack is the epitome of anime sound. It makes every scene twice as dramatic and fear-inducing. Intensity is seriously jacked up whenever they play a soundtrack, as if it weren't good enough already. To cope with this, the voice acting is phenomenal, and is the only anime I know of that has both of the most well-liked seiyuu of all time in main roles. Okabe and Mayuri are amazing, enough said. I'll get to that later though. Back to your headphones, the sound effects are another thing that sold the series for me, probably because you won't hear them in any other series. Not that they're fantastic, but they are an attempt to be different, which I really appreciate. Now for my favorite part: the opening and ending themes. If you've heard them you probably don't even need to read this section. Warning: fanboy incoming. 
DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW GOOD HACKING TO THE GATE IS?! WELL?! DO YOU?! I BET NOT, BECAUSE ONLY THE SONG ITSELF IS GOOD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND IT'S OWN GOODNESS! I DON'T CARE IF THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK WE ARE?!
Ok, got that out of the way. My anger management therapist couldn't make it today, I had to get it out somewhere (Ok, I know I'm not funny ;-;). In all seriousness, Hacking to the Gate is one of the most iconic and memorable opening themes, and unlike most others, is actually great. The ending theme, to top it off, I feel is superior to the opening theme and is one of the most underrated endings themes ever. Both fit perfectly with the intense sci-fi feel of the series, while also not being too over the top. There truly is close to nothing wrong with how Steins;Gate sounds.
Probably the only part where I negatively contrast with the wide opinion on this series is character. To be more specific, one character in particular: Makise. Before you go ape because I badmouthed your waifu, here me out. We can all agree that Makise has red hair right? Ok, good. Well can we all agree that she's just a typical tsundere with a few genius moments that just happened to be placed in the right anime as the lead heroine and get a ton of fame for it? Yeah, I didn't think so. But that's honestly what I thought of her. And the rest of the lab members, too. Even Mayuri... and my god I love Mayuri. but all of the female lab members (counting Ruka, who even knows with hi-... it?) are just characters designed to match up to every kind of otaku fetish there is. Daru, too, I guess might be an attempt to be relatable. However, like I was saying earlier, it's because they are placed in this anime that they gain such fame. And, even though I kind of do, I don't say it completely out of malice, if that makes any sort of sense to you. It's because these characters are placed in such a fantastic world that they are able to surpass the average trope. Not saying that they stray TOO far from it, enough to make you forget their roots, but they do it enough to at least feel innovative, something I, and the fans, greatly appreciate. But there's still one character I have yet to talk about. Okabe Rintarou is one of the best protagonists a visual novel adaptation has ever seen, if not the best. He's up there with the greats in protagonists in general, as well. He just oozes creativity, from his design to his goofy quirks to how he reacts in dangerous situations. I don't have anything but praise for this eccentric mad scientist. Sonuvabitch.
So, is Steins;Gate worth the watch? Well, I'm sure you've already read the overall rating, but just to clarify, the answer is YEEEEEEEES. This is the kind of anime you only see once in a decade, so it's certainly not something to be missed, or to be put on hold either. I beg you, push through the confusion and I guarantee you satisfaction, even if it's just from the opening and ending themes. El psy congroo everyone.",9

                By the way, this review is SPOILER FREE!
This was a great anime. Even though it was slow, I still enjoyed the story. I though the first part was needed because it introduced the characters and their goals and not be confused. Then, even though you knew it was coming, the twist occurs and you will never guess it if you even spend your life 24/7 guessing. The anime was also well written with complicated explanations that was needed for a Science anime. I would drop the anime if it was explained childishly and make it obvious that its all fiction. Also, the art was great,
                  but nothing special, and I don't look at the sound quality of anime. Anyway, this was a great anime and you need to watch it.",10
"
                I don't have words to express my love for this Anime. Simply, one of the best Animes to ever appear. I actually feel blessed to be able to watch this.
Starts slow and immature. But soon plot develops great as well as the characters and their relations. Amazing and very realistic characters. Great plot. Great sound and animation. Very emotional. I was skeptic when heard that this show was about time travel but it exceeded all my expectations. It's amazing and must watch show. Consider that I gave a 10 for this show and I am very hard to get impressed.
The writing and dialogue in this
                  anime is another thing I really liked, it's just awesome. The anime might seem slow paced to many because it is basically dialogue and interactions for the first few episodes but not for me. It was so enjoyable that it didn't even seem a bit boring or slow paced. 
What I enjoyed most was the chemistry between the two protagonists and the way these characters develop, they quickly became my favourite anime couple. Also, the execution of the time travel story was well done, time travel being a genre that many have failed to illustrate properly.
This part may not be THAT important but, I think I have to point it out. This anime is complex due to the fact that it mentions a lot of things. Some theories about time travelling, the problem of the year 2000 (Y2K). The story about the time traveller (John Titor). Luckily, I knew all about these things, so I didn't have problems to understand some parts of the anime. But I'm sure more than one person will not know about these things, I would really recommend people to look them up, if you do that, besides that you'll know exactly what they're talking about, those are very interesting things, and people may get interested about them. Who's not interested in time travelling!?
I think that's all I have to say. I'm sad I can only give this anime a 10, it really deserves more than a simple 10.
El Psy Congroo !!.",10
"
                This show has everything you could ask for in an anime: FRIENDSHIP, ROMANCE, HUMOR, ACTION, SUSPENSE, TRAGIC BACKSTORIES...everything!
It starts off slow relative to where it ends up at, but I found it enjoyable the whole way through. I watched the show in English, and in it, the characters are hilarious and adorable. It seems that the writer paid a lot of attention to getting their banter to work just right (Alternate title for this series could literally be Banter: The Animation) and as long as the humor clicks for you, you should have fun watching this series. Although, if the humor doesn't jive with you,
                  this show might wind up driving you insane as the jokes literally. never. stop. as the role of ""comic relief character"" is filled by the leading man (at least when things aren't getting too serious).
Other than that, I think the animation style is really good. It's closer to, say, a Ghost in the Shell or a Paranoia Agent rather than a moe Haruhi or Angel Beats or what have you. The character designs are cute but have a naturalistic look to them.  Every place they visit looks like somewhere you could go, although the show's palette does use a helluva lot of brown. The characters can make some unintentionally weird/scary/off-model faces now and then, but that's nothing new for anime. Try not to look too hard? 
One of the other great things about this show is that it's not weird or perverted in the way a lot of other animes are, which makes it easier to share. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes sci-fi, humor, romances and series that can strike a balance between fun as well as serious and sad moments.",9
"
                Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love sci-fi, but time travel? I never took much delight in shows dealing with the concept of time travel and my opinion has only been furthered due to the overuse of the concept. Plus, add that in with the fact that this anime was incredibly hyped, I reluctantly, without readying any reviews, picked Steins;Gate up with low expectations.
And let me just say this.
I‚Äôve never been more wrong in my life.
I really was expecting a half-baked show filled with countless plot holes, but to my surprise, I ended up with a show that was complex, thought-provoking and exceptionally captivating.
The story and
                  cast does start off really slow, which was probably the biggest flaw to this series. It tends to drag on a bit more than it should in certain scenes and at first you‚Äôll find the cast of Steins;Gate a bit aggravating.
On the outside, there‚Äôs no hiding the fact that the cast of Steins;Gate is generic. Our main cast consists of a mad scientist, an alluring tsundere, an overweight and perverted hacker and a seemingly pointless, na√Øve girl that‚Äôs all too moe.  
However, by the end I had grown to love each and every one of the characters. For one I especially loved Okabe and Kurisu, their relationship was genuine, amusing to watch and perfectly paced. Never was the chemistry between the two forced.
And most surprising was how much I grew to like Mayuri at the end. I‚Äôm not a big fan of moe and at first I swear that was the only being of her existence. All she did was act cute; screwing up, walking around completely clueless and spouting ‚ÄúToo-too-roo‚Äù way too many times. But slowly Mayuri shows her true colors as a very well-rounded character; never detracting from the story, but instead building up the story. Literally, Miyuri is the perfect example of moe done right.
Really, underneath the outwardly clich√©d look of the whole cast, each character is compelling, each having their own unique characteristics and they certainly don‚Äôt feel generic in the slightest. Not only are the characters incredibly well characterized for their role, but as the story goes on we see how they all slowly grow, progress and mature. Essentially, the cast of Steins;Gate holds something a generic cast tend to lack, and that‚Äôs substance.
Like the cast, stick with the story for its first few episodes and you‚Äôre in for something truly spectacular. I was so tempted to drop this show at first, but when the real meat of the story comes, it took its formula that I was rolling my eyes at and turns it into something beautifully original.
A lot of thought was put into the writing. It‚Äôs neatly executed, never losing steam as it builds up tension and suspense, balancing its humor and its seriousness, never letting one override the other, and above all, Steins;Gate was cunningly unpredictable, throwing in elements of well-utilized shock value when you least expect it and taking seemingly irrelevant events and making them into riveting plot twists.
Of course, Steins;Gate still comes with its share of plot holes, but it‚Äôs so enthralling and well-crafted that it hardly matters in the end. Besides, what story about time travelling isn‚Äôt going to end up with some plot holes of some sort?",9

                Favorite Quote: ""No one knows what the future holds. That's why its potential is infinite."" -Okabe Rintarou
Originally, I did a review on Steins Gate in my old account, son714, but I lost the account information due to complications with my laptop so I made a new account!  I'll change up the review, but for the most part it will cover most of the things I talked about in my old account.  During my high school years, I had a friend who continuously asked if I had seen Steins Gate yet.  At first, I didn't know what to expect since the only anime
                  I was watching at that time was Naruto Shippuden.  After watching this anime however, I'm glad that I didn't skip it.  Let's get on with the review now.  
Story: So I'll start of by saying that this anime is pretty confusing at first, no exaggeration.  It's best to pay close attention to the small details presented during the series, it'll help you understand the plot better.  With this in mind, it is not to say that you'll be totally confused.  This ""confusion"" is what makes this particular anime series so special and unique.  Furthermore, Steins;gate is about time travel.  In short, most shows and movies involving time travel lose their overall plot and become somewhat plain and repetitive.  For example, the movie Back to the Future became somewhat predictable at times and could lose your interest in the overall story line.  However, Steins;gate is rather different then most time travel shows or movies.  So now you might ask what makes this show less cheesy, and interesting than other time traveling shows?  To answer this, it was the pacing and characters supplemented the story's time traveling plot.  
10/10
Art: The artwork in Steins;gate was simply beautiful.  Nothing felt overdone and not to mention the character designs were interesting.  They all seemed to fit their personalities real well.
10/10
Sound: I absolutely loved the soundtrack, the opening theme, and the ending theme as well.  At times, the soundtrack definitely added to the suspense of the show and helped enhance the comical interactions between characters.
10/10
Characters: The strongest aspect in this anime would be the characters.  Every character in this series were complex, interesting, and funny.  Each one all served a purpose to the plot.  It was also great to see the characters develop over time and get used to one another.  This is clearly depicted when looking at our two main characters.  Their initial attitudes and feelings towards one another can be described as water and oil.  They could never seem to agree with one another on theories of time travel and loved to tease each other.  Eventually, they began to soften up and became fond of one another.  It was great to see them change, not only in a positive way, but in a way that was crucial to the story.  Many physics theories were also discussed in the anime between the characters which made it even more interesting.
10/10
My Opinion: To sum it up, Steins;gate is a one of a kind anime despite being a time travel show.  This anime had me intrigued and curious all the way until the very end.  The story, the characters, and the time travel theories were very memorable.  After the series I found myself wanting to know more about the characters and the overall universe that they were in.  I am aware that this anime may not be for everyone however.  If you guys expect quick plot development, you won't see it in Steins;gate, but I hope you guys can give the show a chance.  Like I mentioned before, this anime is a hidden gem in the sci-fi time travel genre.  This anime definitely holds up to its name and hype as a masterpiece.  It is a fantastic show that shouldn't be quick to judge and overlooked as being overrated or simply too boring.  If somebody were to ask me what my favorite anime of all time would be I would gladly say with all my heart, Steins;gate!
Thank you for reading my review guys! Hope you enjoyed it!
Final Score: 10/10 a masterpiece",10

                I have put off watching this anime for too long, despite me hearing praises about Steins; Gate all the time. I thought it was overhyped, that I could watch it at a later date, but that is not the case with this masterpiece. With that intro, let's talk about why Steins; Gate is so good. 
Story- Steins; Gate has one of the best stories I have seen in fiction. Normally, when I hear that a show has time travel elements in it, I expect a ton of plot holes. When I first watched the show, I was content with the first 11 episodes but was
                  puzzled by why the anime was ranked #2 on MAL. However, after that, the story picked up fast and I became memorized with the show. Don't be discouraged with the first 11 episodes, because you'll miss out on a really great show. The show deals with a delusional scientist that is trapped in a world of complex time traveling. However, it soon stops being fun when real lives are on the line. The show has the best ending I have seen to date, and the plot is worth watching for alone. 
Art- White Fox made this, and since I have never heard of them, I was wondering how the art would be. It ended up being extremely good, and the way they zoom up the face is amazing. 
Sound- One of the best OPs, and some of the best music I have heard. 
Character- The show features my favorite character, Okabe Rintarou. At first, I hated him due to his eccentricity. However, he soon grew on me and made the first 11 episodes interesting. Looking in hindsight, I am actually glad they chose to build the characters for the first 11 episodes because I soon became attached to every one of them. The mad scientist Okabe, the genius Kurisu, the super hacker Daru, the adorable Mayushi, the feminine Ruka, the shy Moeka, and the caring Suzuha cap of this phenomenal cast. 
Enjoyment- Easily a 10/10 here. The story was already good as it reached the 12th episode, but it took off from there. I didn't even realize how much I watched until I was done with the series. Be careful because it is easy to get addicted to this show. 
Overall- Amazing Masterpiece. Nothing more needs to be said. Does this still not convince you to watch the show?",10

Character 10/10
Enjoyment 10/10
Overall 10/10
This anime is a piece of art. Highly recommended to people who like: Science / Thrillers / Comedy / Mystery / Realistic Anime.
Story: With many twists, it can take you from laughing hapilly to getting depressed. Having said that, it's well-balanced with a lot of twists in the plot but all-in-all will keep you at the edge of your seat !
Art: I especially find this art amazing, the face expressions, characteristics and emotions can be clearly shown and understood thanks to it, it's trully helpful for such an emotional anime.
Sound: The soundtracks used are 100% suitable and keep you interested in the scene as well as makeyou feel for the characers.
Characters: The Characters' development is honestly amazing. It's really realistic and in-depth, it successfully passes their feelings to the viewer.
Enjoyment: Even if it gets you too sad at the point of thinking ""I should drop this"" especially if you're the kind of viewer who cries over anime (personally not one) then NO WORRIES ! The twists will surely make up for it, I gurantee that !
Overall: All in all, this is a perfect anime, totally one of the best I've ever watched and I've watched plenty. People who love anime that make you Feel For the characters are gonna LOVE THIS since it makes you feel like you know the characters personally. Once again: Highly recommended to people who like: Science / Thrillers / Comedy / Mystery / Realistic Anime.",10
"
                The most annoying thing about so many time travel stories is that they have gigantic plot-holes and paradoxes that the writers somehow missed and/or ignored.  Yeah, you don't have to worry about that with Steins;Gate.  Not one bit.
STORY:  10
This is by far the best time travel I've ever seen, because everything just works.  It all makes sense and if time travel were to exist, I bet you this is how it would work.  Maybe the methods of time travel are a little bit far-fetched, with the whole miniature black hole thing, but the ideas of multiple world lines and the
                  butterfly effect make more sense than any other time travel series.  The idea of sending text messages back in time to change the past and then realizing that brains store data just like cell phones do, thus sending consciousness back in time is really well thought out and I like it.
The best part about this story though is how emotional and well-planned it is.  I won't spoil anything, but I will tell you that EVERYTHING that happens in this story matters.  EVERYTHING.
The pacing is probably the most criticized aspect of Steins;Gate.  The first half of the series is intriguing, but could have seriously happened in like half of the episodes that it did, and then the next few episodes seem super fast in comparison.  Eventually things even out, but I would like to point out that at one point, Okabe says something about everything just seeming like a blur.  Well the drastic shift to fast pacing really put us in his shoes.  I have no idea if that was intentional or not but it worked really well.
ART:  8
The art is great, for what it is.  What I mean is that it doesn't even really have many opportunities to shine.  At no point will you noticed something is poorly drawn or animated, but there aren't going to be any massive battles that will make you go ""WOW!"" and that is simply due to the premise of the entire anime itself.  The one thing closest to being particularly impressive is the little animation that happens whenever a time-leap occurs.  It gets the point across and looks really neat with the divergence number bouncing all over the place.
SOUND:  10
The music in Steins;Gate is awesome.  It just is.  The opening is great, the ending is good, and the OST is amazing.  My favorite tracks are Gate of Steiner (all versions of it), Believe Me, Promise, and Farewell.  That's definitely not to say they are the only good ones, though.  The music is really well varied and ranges from creepy to epic to sad.  You will almost certainly be spending some time listening to Steins;Gate music after hearing it for the first time.
The English dub is also one of the best I have ever seen.  All of the main characters' voices really suit them and most are executed wonderfully.
CHARACTER:  10
The main character, Rintarou Okabe, or as he calls himself, Hououin Kyoma, or as his friends call him, Okarin, is extremely unique.  He is what I like to call a genius-idiot.  We see people like this in real life all the time, but maybe not to this crazy extent.  He is very intelligent, but has virtually no common sense.  He has a reason for being such a nut-job which I won't spoil, but it is funny how he has gotten so used to it and does it even when he doesn't need to.  The things he does never cease to amuse.
Makise ""Christina Zombie Assistant Perverted Genius Lab Girl 004"" Kurisu, our other main character, is really well developed as well.  Some people call her a tsundere, but I disagree.  Tsunderes are characters that are mean and hot-headed at first, but show an emotional side after warming up to someone.  Makise Kurisu was never rude and never really had a temper.  She just constantly gets ticked off by Okabe's shenanigans.
Hashida Itaru, or Daru is also an entertaining character, and is a BIT stereotypical, but the show capitalizes on that really well and makes everything even more funny with his one-liners.  He actually does play an important role, so don't completely write him off as useless.
Shiina Mayuri, or Mayushi, is a little ditsy and weird, but I still find her funny.  She is also super important, do give her a chance.
There are some other characters like Suzuha, Ferris, Ruka, and Moeka, but they are better left for you to see on your own.  There's not really much about them that I feel like I need to say.
Enjoyment:  10
The first half of Steins;Gate is hilarious and intriguing and the second half is a suspenseful, emotional roller-coaster, to say the least.  I enjoyed every bit of it.  Needless to say, I am REALLY hyped up for Steins;Gate 0!  (Don't Google what that is or anything, because the mere concept of it will majorly spoil the original series for you.)
Overall:  10
The Steins;Gate anime adaptation is not as detailed as the original visual novel, and questionably left out a few scenes, but it isn't something you would notice unless you've already ""played"" the visual novel.  Regardless, you should still watch it.  If you love it like I did, then try out the visual novel for an even more detailed experience!",10
"
                With its dark, relatively limited pallet, quirky characters, and time travel plot, this anime has gained the attention of many of those following the past two anime seasons. That anime is, if the title is as much an indication as I intended, Steins;Gate. 
What started as a strange, oddly slice of life-like scifi series centering on a college student ‚ÄúMad Scientisto‚Äù named Okabe Rintarou and his crew of eccentric friends and associates quickly took a turn for the dramatic with the introduction of a means to send thoughts to the past, which caught the eye of evil research organization SERN. Since that point, Steins;Gate really
                  grabbed the aniblogosphere and proceeded to hold on for dear life. And by that, I mean it was really fucking awesome, leading up to a suspenseful, satisfying finale.
Based off a visual novel of the same name, Steins;Gate has a rather intrinsic, yet layered plot that provides a beguiling narrative supported by a surprisingly strong cast of characters. Helming the varied cast is none other than Okabe himself, one of the best characters to grace anime in a long time. An eccentric at heart who at first does crazy stuff just because he assumes it‚Äôs what mad scientists do, as the events of the succeeding episodes unfold, he‚Äôs pulled further and further into a psychosis that begins to actually take form against his will. Hell, I could (and probably will at some point) write a post detailing how I think his mental decay is one of the best displays of character development of the season. 
Helping Okabe in his mad scientisto exploits is the tsundere, closeted 2channeler Kurisu, Mayuri, the prerequisite ditzy moeblob and Daru, the quintessential otaku. There is also Okabe‚Äôs landlord Mr. Braun, shrine maiden Ruka, and unbelievably shy tall girl Moeka. As the events of the episodes unfold and Okabe tests his time travel inventions more and more, the timeline is altered to such an extent that Okabe inadvertently gets himself into trouble with various shady organizations who want in on his secrets.
As it goes for the best of two cour series, developments are unveiled slowly and deliberately over time, allowing for maximum understanding and immersion in the setting while appreciation for the characters grows in direct proportion. The first half is entirely dedicated to subtle changes in the plot, driving things forward at a slow enough pace for the audience to take in the character interactions and the way their surroundings impact them. I wouldn‚Äôt call it masterful, but the setup is good, even if it focuses too much on inconsequential side characters and concepts at times. 
At around the halfway point,one of the main characters is killed off repeatedly (And often hilariously), and Okabe ‚Äòtime leaps‚Äô back to the past again and again in an effort to save her. However, despite his efforts it seems that she‚Äôs preordained to die at a certain time unless the timeline is reverted to before Okabe started messing with it. While these episodes are good enough that you don‚Äôt really notice it, a few could‚Äôve been omitted without losing the impact, and the requisite nods to the other arcs on the visual novel are somewhat sloppy. Thankfully it gets back on track for a very strong finish, where Steins;Gate solidifies itself as one of the best series of the year by far.
The animation, while nothing exemplary, gets the job done well enough, and I have very few problems with it aside from oddly placed bloom in the cities and a general pervading darkness throughout that makes screencaps somewhat annoying. 
If you‚Äôre looking for something to pass the time, you could do far worse. Hell, I‚Äôd go as far to say that this is the best visual novel adaptation of the year, and one of the best ever. The plot works out well for the most part without focusing on unnecessary side arcs, and it feels less like an advertisement for the VN than it does an excellent enough standalone plot. Definitely recommended for any of those with discriminating taste who can stomach occasionally trite relationships and a silly plot.",8

                Steins;Gate is a very well directed series. I‚Äôll admit that. The editing, settings and characters are excellent. But the fact that it takes TWELVE painfully slow episodes to actually get going is ridiculous and puts a huge stain on something that could‚Äôve been better. The second half is good, but not good enough to make up for the first. As I said before the characters are great but honestly, the story never really did a whole lot to interest me. Could be worse, but overall this is nothing special and it sure as hell doesn't deserve a spot on the top anime list.

                Starting off right off in the beginning I didn't know where or what the anime itself was going to start off as. (Didn't read the synopsis/information about Steins;Gate) 
If i had to dislike something about Steins;Gate I would honestly have to say how when the ending song starts playing, at the very end there is no preview.
Time travel, John Titor, butterfly effect - and many more terms used throughout Steins;Gate-
 I love the fact that Steins;Gate used Time travel and the concepts of these so called ""time travellers"" and their ways of time travelling (while including some improvised objects/things/subjects/theories/etc)
But in another view that is what
                  makes Steins;Gate more interesting and mysterious. Letting off the person watching on a small cliff hanger.
MY main 5 characters:
Sitting there while watching I personally found Okabe Rintarou the most intriguing and overthetop character that has tons of humanlike natures in one. Of course there is Itaru being that character that I can relate to with technology and his sexual innuendos with anime and characters. Both topping off the characters.
In second I found Mayuri and Kurisu as those characters that were able to balance out the male characters. With Mayuri being cute, lost in thoughts, or not comprehending the situation at hand caught me off guard. Kurisu also those moments of being cute- being scientific and all (If I were to meet Kurisu she'd be my ultimate match or at least my bestest friend)
Last but not least- Ruka Urushibara - The ""girl"" that caught me off guard. JUST LIKE THE MOMENT IN BLACK BUTLER (aka Kuroshitsuji) >.>
At first I was like ""OMG say word, she is actually cuter than Mayuri or Kurisu"" but it was a lie. They got me good. ""She"" puts the he in she- But either way Ruka played ""her"" part as well - (liked the fact Ruka is similar to Hideyoshi from Baka to Test. Though not everyone mistakes Ruka for a girl except for some exceptions) The Miku outfits also got to me. Got me in a shock and awe. Actually Ruka got me into a Shock and Awe. 
Everyone else played their roles - though I do not want to go in depth with it. Wish to only talk about the main ones I found interesting/intriguing.
The art and sound too played a part in delivering the story to the viewer (in my opinion) With the VA for Okabe being the AWESOME mad scientist along with the other VA's for the other characters. The audio interaction with the characters could not be any GREATER than it actually is. This also got me liking the characters.
While enjoying the anime's progression the story PLAYED the KEY part of the whole thing. Like foundation to a building. You would have to understand the story right off the bat the second it is available for you to pick up. Without picking up the story you would only understand half of what would happen and what was to come.
I want to believe that time travel is possible (Yet I do) until we actually have the technological inventions to time travel- I will wait.",10
"
                First and foremost, if you're reading these reviews in search of an awnser to that typical question ""Is it worth it?"", it is. 
This is the story of Okabe, who rolls, unrolls and messes with timelines, starting with nothing more than a microwave that can send text messages to the past.
Succeeding in almost every single aspect, Steins;Gate will slowly win you piece by piece into the amazing and interesting storyline, so interesting that at every given moment you feel like the anime could easily fall to a complete disaster. Proving itself a masterpiece, it simply doesn't let it happen.
How can an anime about time travel
                  be this good?
Story: 10 
Everyone knows that a story with a complex plot will probably stop being interesting after a few episodes ,steins gate however is diferent, simply being ever growing in terms of complexity, managing to be quite easy to comprehend, giving you a feeling of fullfillment and enjoyment at that.
You can almost feel the enjoyment the author (Kenji Mizuta) had when writting this down.
Proving flawless in a category where failing is so easy and enhancing that dificulty with the cheer amount of references, this story clearly deserves this 10.
Art:  7
Although rarely explored, the best adjectif i could find to define the art was, ""satisfactory"", due to being good enough to fit the style of the anime but not enough to impress anyone.
The art really won't affect your opinion on the anime.
Sound: 10
Heartwarming and heartbreaking. Played with the perfect timing, soundtracks can't enhance your experience more than this.
But don't expect songs to be thrown at you, there are enough beautifull ost's to make your ears and eyes droll, however, these will only be played at the right scene and some are only played 2 or 3 times the whole anime.
Soundtracks, sound effects and voice acting at its finest.
Check the ost's out, even if you haven't watched the anime.
An outstanding 10.
Character: 10
The story focuses on the main character, Okabe, a charismatic fellow that called himself a mad scientist and pretended to be a ""mad scientist"", his introduction is quite fast. I could go on and on explaining every single trait of his, but to be honest every secondary character is just as interesting and deep, though the spotlight manages to stay in the main character.
10,10,10 and 10. 
Enjoyment: 10
You're watching anime to have fun, to be interested in what you're watching
right? 
Well this anime succeeds in both extremelly well wilst doing so much more.
You can actually feel the enjoyment the author (Kenji Mizuta) had when writting this down.
Overall:   9
You could classify Steins;Gate as ""that homework papel that ended up wining the nobel prize"" and i seriously hope that future animes follow this anime as a guideline on how to make an anime(though that will be a very risky task).",9

                When I saw some of steins;gate's characters for the first time on pictures I was not attracted at all to be honest. As a result I wasn't expecting much from the anime and I only watched it after countless forums said I SHOULD. 
And by god dont ever judge a book by its cover! The story starts off slow but after the preperations are made this show skyrockets.
Usually I'm also not a fan of time travel but steins;gate hit a homerun with the storyline (in my books at least).
very likeable characters and original as well ->  give it a chance x3

                I'm definitely in the minority here, but I think this anime is quite overrated... The story is decent, but (like things that deal with time travel) not everything makes too much sense.... I can't say I really like any of the characters in particular.... the art style is not bad, but not something that stood out to me... 
It was definitely interesting and it is worth rewatching so you can understand what's going on.... but I would definitely NOT put this as the 2nd top anime right now... 
Perhaps my review score is low because I want to offset the hype, but I don't feel
                  I'm too off base... But that's just my opinion.",6
"
                Gets good after episode 11 my a$$, I really tried to give this show a try but the mediocre art, dull plotline and absolutely horrible characters made it too much to bear so i'm dropping it at episode 15 because there is no way I'm gonna keep torturing myself like this with the hopes that it'll ""eventually get good""
Everything about this anime is lacking and devoid of enjoyment but what apalls me the most is the characters. First we have the protagonist, a NEET in his late teens with severe chuunibyou. He's narcissistic and not even in a funny way and the way he treats
                  women is so weird. Then we have the two female leads that have stereotypical tsundere and genki good-girl personalities that clearly exist exclusively to eventually become the protagonists' love interests. 
All the jokes fall flat and it's the perfect example of a show that takes itself so seriously yet fails at it, leaving me with unbearable second-hand embarrassment. It's so pretentious yet it has no reason to be, and it's not that I don't like more  serious anime/manga, I've watched and enjoyed shows like monster, banana fish, mirai nikki, evangelion, fma/fmab, etc. it's just steins;gate that's bad.
I can't believe this show is so high ranked. The art isn't even good enough to save it, the art is okay at best, the voice acting is also not incredible, and i'd forgive the show for being ridiculous if it wasn't so g.d. boring, but here we are.",3
"
                One of those animes that nobody stops gushing about. I certainly loved Steins;Gate, so I hate to point out the fact that although being extremely engaging, the starting few episodes were not that interesting.
The main character, a crackpot scientist, has illusions of grandeur, and believes that he can one day overtake the world with his pathetic inventions. Although this makes for a great setting, I was stumped at seeing how slow the anime was in getting on with the storyline. If it didn't have such rave reviews, I doubt that I'd have had continued watching it.
As for the rest, there is hardly anything to crib
                  about. The plot's great, the characters are interesting and funny (except that girl that goes ""Too-da-dooo"") and the pace gets pretty good. Its been one hell of an emotional roller-coaster, with all the innocent people dying all time (unlike Tokyo Ghoul, where dying is sort of a given).",9
"
                This anime, is a must watch one. I guarantee you, you will not regret.
Let's talk about the story first. (10/10)
It's marvelous. If you like mech/sci-fi/romance/mystery anime, then this is a no brainer to watch.
It's not really unique, there are some animes that has ALMOST the same plot.
I think they could've done the character dev's episode a bit better. The introduction was good, but i miss a bit of information about some characters.
There is a bit of comedy and romance in it but not too much though.
This anime was on my plan to watch list for 2 years, and now that ive watched it. I feel really stupid to thought that this anime is just overhyped, totally worth it.
Ending was perfect. No further comment.
Art  (9/10)
The art feels like a decent anime, ( no big eyes, and boing boing, etc )
Fluid, no broken CGI.
The character design is not really unique, it kinda reminds me of Highschool of the Dead somehow, except the MC.
Sound  (8/10)
Feels really mechish, and sci-fi-ish. With the ""bzzt bzzt"" effect. 
Opening and ending are good. 
Voice acting fits perfect with the characters, especially the MC. They act really good in any kind of moments and scene.
Character  (8/10)
Like i said the character reminds me of Highschool of the Dead, except the MC. Seriously everything just fits perfectly how they react and act to each other, and how they grow.
Enjoyment  (10/10)
I enjoyed every single episode, there are no episode that is boring or just a filler. So you better not skip one episode. 
I think anyone would love this anime, even those people who doesnt like anime, or people who dislikes sci-fi, drama.
Overall  (9/10)
You must watch this. MUST!",9
"
                Stein's Gate is a good choice for you if you're looking for a plain anime about the circumstances of time travel and the fact that time doesn't wait for nobody. It becomes a bad choice if you expect it to do anything noteworthy with its concept, because it tries to focus on showcasing something any series to feature time travel does as its core theme.
As a anime, there's nothing particularly wrong done in it. I even think that it succeeded in what it did try to portray for its core theme, which is that time travel can be dangerous and leave serious repercussions due to
                  how every action changes how things will go and so on. And it also tries to explain that time waits for no one and to deliver this lesson through its story, that there's no better moment than now to act. But these are themes that in any story medium that has featured time travel elements, have been explored, while doing a lot more things than just this. To the point my viewing experience of this anime was this: Oh yeah, using your time travel powers irresponsibly will cause bad repercussions, thanks 9154th story that told me that. You opened my eyes. TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE? Does that mean that every single day that passed in my life, each day I have lived, on each of them... I got one day older?
I can't really fault the anime for what it did. It didn't really have any faults in almost every technical aspect and I think it did get its point across, regardless of whether or not every other show I watched also did.
What I fault it for is its lack of ambition.
Its characters are the most barebone essentials in order for them to work. The group dynamic of its main characters are a clutzy girl, a serious guy and another guy that is foolhardy, the most generic japanese childhood friend trio ever. The personality of each character is generic and easy to sum in a couple of tropes. Whoever doesn't have a trope to be assigned to them, doesn't have an inkling of a personality. There's nothing interesting about any of them.
The way the power is introduced is as accidental to the person and with a lot of clock and time indications along the way in case you have not read the title of the anime you're watching. It's called Stein's Gate. You're welcome. And when she gets to the point of talking to someone about her powers, that person describes what it is like they completely understand it, because I assume they also had that power. And because it's a really easy way to just explain it. By the way, did I ever tell you that this movie is called Stein's Gate. Yo Clocks.
It doesn't really go into any other theme than the irresposible use of time travel might fuck up your life and that of your friends. Like none at all. I mean I guess it tries to build a romance but I can't get interested in that when the characters are just bland, but the romantic tale plays out into the time waits for no one bit, so I can't say it's something out of turn here. Even then, it plays into the time waits for no one bit.
These are pretty much the ways in which the anime just doesn't seem to be trying anything other than being adequate.
As far as its romance goes, it's basically trying to hit you with the ""I regret I never hooked up with one of the friends I got along and now I'm 40 and single."" It doesn't really strike me, I typically find indecisiveness and lack of assertiveness stupid, but I guess there's some people to which this can appeal to, so all I'll say about it is the type of romance it features is that of lost opportunity.
Other than that, there's not a lot to say about the animation, it does what I expect it to do in a anime, featuring a lot of detail and a vivid world, despite the fact that it looks bland, through the fact that there's usually some things happening in the background or actively. Sound wise, I guess the best compliment I can muster for it is that for the most part it didn't feel intrusive. Other than that, nothing noteworthy to mention, negative or positive.
The best person I can recommend this for is someone that is looking for the type of romance I've had mentioned and doesn't really know anything about time travel stories. But I can't really recommend this movie to literally anyone else, because I couldn't in good faith recommend something that feels like is just a raw ingredient, when there's so many plates with so much welldone cooking, that feature this ingredient and many others. If you're specifically looking for just the things this anime does, then you can go for it. The name of this movie is Stein's Gate. Yo Clocks.",2
"
                The only reason i am writing this review is because not enough people appreciate the soundtracks steins;gate had, the ost's were amazing and i can't think of a single anime that can compare.
 along with that the story was a masterpiece where the author used his outstanding creativity in order to put elements of physics and real life and manipulate them logically fit the concept of time travel. All the character had great character development as all the main characters were fully developed by the end of the show. The art is beautiful and along with the sound it gives you a summer feel. overall
                  this anime is definitely a master piece 10/10.",10

                If you seek to start sympathizing with the otaku culture as a whole, Steins;Gate is going to be very helpful
I understand how most people feel about Steins;Gate. I understand that it has caused many people to be invested in anime and appreciate anime better. I understand that in many ways people felt sympathy for and related to some of the characters in Steins;Gate. And I also understand that for many Steins;Gate is an experience they will never forget. There are many reasons Steins;Gate has had this impact on people, and more often than not, the reason is personal and many people might find difficulty putting
                  it into words, as I have noticed that when they try they will simply just end up reiterating that they love it a lot without fully understanding why, which is fine.
I do not feel the same way about Steins;Gate as most of the people that have watched it. I will not be the person to praise it to no end and say that it has made me feel things nothing else ever did. But it left an impact on me regardless, because of its core strengths: Its capacity to make you sympathize with the characters on screen and presenting very fluent characterization that captures who a character is and why they behave in the way they do. 
Like it or not, otaku culture is not looked well upon by a lot of people, and this causes some people to steer clear from anime as a medium. The reasons all relate to how anime causes people within the otaku culture to behave or even those that are enthusiastic about it . Be it because they are afraid of how certain people project certain traits they wish they had through the shows they have watched, be it because they apply to real life the mentality of a character from a fictional show that has a setting with heavily fantastical elements that do not apply to reality, be it because people end up closing off from their social life and replace their group with idealized versions of who they wish they could interact with, and the list could go on further. All of these unhealthy traits are not only considered socially unacceptable and cause people to behave such, they also cause these people to think in ways where if you do not understand the context behind what they say, their interests will cause them to alienate themselves from whoever they might try to interact with. I do find it unfair to reject an entire medium based on the behavior of certain people, but I understand why the disdain for anime is produced. It is not as simple as ‚Äûaren‚Äôt you too old to watch cartoons?‚Äù
The story of Steins;Gate is set in Akihabara, a commercial district within Japan where otaku culture thrives, and all of the characters within its story have this culture either deeply ingrained into who they are or are outsiders who on some level have difficulty interacting with the culture or world. The story presents who each character is through the quirks they have and how these quirks cause them difficulty when interacting with others, while during the process setting up for the events that unfold. Close to most of the quirks relate in some way to otaku culture and to fully understand who they represent you would need context from the culture itself to understand what type of behavior each character is following within it. Still, even without the context, even if you won‚Äôt understand how this behavior was formed, Steins;Gate will eventually get you to understand the reasons for which these characters behave the way they do by showing you what the characters and what they struggle with. 
The story is driven forward by Okabe Rintarou, who is characterized as a Chuunibyou, which is a japanese colloquialism for people that act on their delusions of grandeur and develop a persona just for that. The term exists because these people act outwardly as if their delusions are true, in an attempt to stand out and be desirable to people, throwing their imperfections to the side. Okabe, acts in the stereotypical manner of a Chuunibyou. First of all, he pretends that he is fighting against an organization, often talking on a phone on which there is no call about a mission with heavily exaggerated code names that sound cool. This is done by Okabe in a way that outwardly targets the person observing his behavior and this interaction for Okabe has the purpose of making it seem as if there is more to him than what is displayed, with the intent of causing the target to be interested on who he is. However, with one quick glance and very little thought, it becomes obvious to anyone that if anybody would actually have a grandiose mission, they would not talk about it openly and secrecy would be of utmost importance, so this fa√ßade fools nobody, even if his friends accept it. On a smaller scale but with the same purpose, Okabe also sometimes acts as if he has special powers and he understands things of supernatural nature or that the very least can hardly be explained. And last, he acts in a manner that is meant to put some distance between himself and other people. His behavior often puts people down, due to the fa√ßade it is seen as harmless, but Okabe essentially just plays hard to get. He essentially through his persona tries to push people away from who he really is, with the hope that his persona is going to be so interesting to them that they will pursue Okabe. This behavior really is just a projection of what Okabe truly wants, which only sabotages his goals because it is a behavior that is dishonest. Rather than engaging people about their interests and carefully observing them for who they are, Okabe chooses to take every idealized notion he thinks other people would admire, and creates a persona deeply influenced by what is considered cool within the otaku culture.
But the story goes beyond just portraying that Okabe‚Äôs behavior and mentality and it instead challenges Okabe‚Äôs psyche by making everything that he tried to portray to other people become true. 
Okabe and his friends have a ‚Äúscience laboratory‚Äù where they create experimental gadgets that center around some ridiculous idea. Most of them have very little practical use but there is no denying that the people within the laboratory have a grasp on the in-world‚Äôs scientific concepts. Eventually, as time goes on they hit a breakthrough and manage to send phone messages back in time. The more they develop this idea, more people join in and they learn more about the world and how it would intend to use this technology. Every single scene is one more piece of the puzzle that provides even more context about what impact this technology can have, how it gets these characters to interact, how the world would make use of this technology and the fact that Okabe has some ability that causes him to be affected differently by any changes done to the timeline. Without giving the outcome away, eventually, all the events around him cause Okabe to be what a Chuunibyou aspires to project outwardly. He truly does end up fighting against the circumstances he is placed in, with them having large ramifications on the world at large, and due to the fact that he has a special power he is the only character to have retained this information. He now knows things no other people should, secrets that he cannot tell, and he is the only one to have the capacity to do anything about it due to the fact that he is special. But while the Chuunibyou stereotypical behavior assumes that this behavior would cause people to gravitate Okabe because he is important, thus making it easier for Okabe to open up outwards, these circumstances only cause Okabe to only retreat even further inwards. It is partly true that these circumstances, as the Chuunibyou stereotype would assume, would put distance between him and people, but at the same time it also has the intended effect Chuunibyou‚Äôs try to project. People become interested in Okabe, because they become concerned and want to help him. But while a Chuunibyou would welcome them even if outwardly they would act in a way that maintains their superiority, Okabe cannot open up to them or let them in. Because no matter how much he wanted to, his circumstances are actually true and he cannot be helped as he actually is indeed special. Rather than accepting the people that approach him, he can only repel them because they can never have context into his situation. Describing Okabe any further than this would be telling you how his character arc concludes which I won‚Äôt do.
But this is enough for me to start saying how exactly Okabe‚Äôs story has affected me. It has shown me that even if I do not understand the intent or cause of someone‚Äôs behavior, I can find them something that is respectable about them. You see, I personally shun a lot of the behavioral traits about otaku culture. Acting like a chuunibyou, projecting your love life onto an idealized 2D picture, all of the weeaboo associated nonsense. But just because I renounce the behavior itself that does not mean that I also have to renounce the person that has this behavior. There was more to Okabe‚Äôs behavior than met the eye, and there is a lot more context to him that I did not provide. But after this behavior was very slowly but carefully removed from the person enforcing it, all I could observe was a person that desperately did not want to be alone. It was something very basic and human that was being approached in an incorrect manner. Okabe was wrong and portrayed as heavily flawed, but a genuinely good person that would forever suffer if ever left alone. Steins;Gate has not proven me wrong, but it has given me more to think about. I am correct to reject the behavior itself and not accept the negative consequences behind it. But just because I understand the outcome of the behavior, it does not mean that I do understand the intent. The intent itself is something that I do not have context on and it is most likely something that I could sympathize with. So even if I find someone‚Äôs behavior abhorrent, I should at the very least try to understand why they behave that way. I should have at the very least some degree of understanding and patience.
As I have said, every character in some manner has been affected socially by the otaku culture. The story showcases who each character is, what are their flaws through dynamic interactions between each character that are portrayed in an often comedic and somewhat neutral way, and why they exist by exploring what they desire through exposing their behavior for what it is. Each character has some depth and their behavior is displayed well through skillful characterization.
Other things that Steins;Gate has to offer is a lot of theoretical concepts that border on metaphysics and discussions surrounding things of that nature, as well as some information on conspiracy theories. The world behaves in a manner that assumes these things are possible and feasible, and incorporates them into the world. In some cases it gives you the context from real life. Most of the ideas of Steins;Gate are not its own, and are used as a realm to explore the group it portrays, so do not expect an anime that rethinks a theoretical concept or the world order at large. Yes, it puts them together in ways that are unique to itself it takes, but its focus is to explore the people it presents, and the theoretical concepts and conspiracy theories are just tools to give further shape to the world of Steins;Gate. If you came for a story that is an adventure about time travel, this will be very different from what you expect, and that can be both a good and a bad thing, depending on what you want to experience.
You see one of the things everyone likes to address, but also has to, is the slow pace of the show. Every scene focuses on providing the viewer with context into what they are watching, and rather than focusing on Steins;Gate being an entertaining process from start to finish, it chooses to put all of its energy into the outcome of each scene, making sure that every scene carries what it intends. Steins;Gate does not pander to provide you with something fun every second of its watch time, but rather to provide you with everything that would help you understand what is going on with who you are seeing. Some people might criticize it for not delivering constant entertainment value on screen, but Steins;Gate through Okabe openly renounces acting cool for no reason. It doesn‚Äôt goof off for the sake of goofing off.  If a scene is there, it is because it tries to tell you something or inform you about something you‚Äôll need to understand for the next message it delivers. Its slow pace is warranted. 
Still, regardless of how well it does the things it does, as well as how genuine it is, Steins;Gate still is something I only personally consider to be fine as a show. A lot of it comes down to personal preference, as I prefer shows to be focused on progressing forward, rather than taking their time. It definitely has a more than warranted enough reason to pace itself in the way that it does, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it will change my preferences simply because of that. Another reason is that, even if I do understand who the characters are and why they behave that way, and I see that there is depth to them, for the most part I do not like them. I don‚Äôt feel a strong dislike towards them; I simply do not care much about them. The reason for that being that: each character was created to fit what the show tried to convey, that they would only matter within the context that they were placed. There is depth to the overall message that is displayed through their use and their behavior, but strip away these elements, and all you are left with are husks. I do get that to a degree that is part of Okabe‚Äôs characterization, but that is the point. He is a husk because it is part of the characterization. In some cases, I did fully understand the behavior, but I was just not interested in who the character was and felt little to no sympathy for them. 
Regardless of that, I praise Steins;Gate for the message it has managed to deliver to me. I‚Äôm sure that the people that have the otaku culture planted deeply into them related in some way to the story, and I am sure that this is one the best stories to humanize the culture to people outside of it. As I have said, if you seek to start sympathizing with the otaku culture as a whole, Steins;Gate is going to be very helpful, as it was helpful to me. It is one of the best shows to be introduced to anime, as it has the potential to eliminate a lot of the preexisting prejudices for the medium. However, I‚Äôd avoid Steins;Gate if the pace itself is something that would really bother you. It has the best reasons it can possibly have to take its time, but again, as it is the case for me, personal preferences are not something that can be reasoned with.",6

                Steins;gate By far the best story I have seen till this moment 
The story's main character is okabe , a Scientist  in the making , a frantic chaotic man who refers to him self as Hououin Kyouma the crazy mad scientist, who together Shiina & hashida has a lab where they try out different inventions , one day he (okabe) goes to lecture about timetravel only disagree with the lecture givin as he walks the halls he sees a murder woman, girl (kurisu ) shocked as to what he sees he sends a mail to his friend not knowing that the phone is connected
                  to the microwave and by some strange reason sends the mail into the past and changes the outcome of the future where the girl (kurisu) is still alive and he is the only one who knows about the change future, she and the lab members come together to examine what happened with the mail send to the past only to get involved in a big conspiracy involving the future of the world as well as the labmembers !  
this anime is really on a different level , the story is intelligent , well put together , and made a good use of existing theory's on the matter of timetravel and alternative timelines 
the characters are well developed and each of them is uniquely wierd , this gives for humorous situations and awesome plot twists
the phase of the series is quick and at first you have no idea what the hell is going on , but as the serie continues the pieces of the puzzle slowly fall in place...
This anime is highly recommened for everyone who loves a unpredictable and well written story 
For my review I give this serie a Perfect 10 ! because anything lower would sell it short !",10
"
                As I was watching this series I was taken back time and time again, to what a clever, slow and well put together a story could be. -No, it is not a ""Shounen"" or a ""Action"" genre series, with that said, you can expect a slower narrative and long awaited outcomes.
You could say ""The cat's out of the bag"" now, but seriously this is not negative at all in my eyes.
One of the stronger aspects in this show, is the Character design, in which they did a brilliant job with, Okabe is one of the most unique and interesting characters i've seen lately, and the
                  story just gets better and better the more variables get thrown into the mix.
I will not spoil anything, and doing so is a serious offense, to such a thriller which thrives in ""experiencing"" it, not only understanding. In alot of moments I found myself not getting alot of the stuff going on, taking in account the extraordinary English used and complex narrative. (and yes, I watched the English dubbing, which I find Superb.)
So to summarize this show for you, it's a very interesting and unique concept done extremely well. I warmly encourage you to experience this show for yourself!",9
"
                So I finished the last episode few minutes ago. (Well to be exact about 26 minutes ago cause I watched that Special Episode 25 which is not just OVA but really important piece of story I would say especially now when the film is coming.) And I have to say that this anime totally got me.
I started to watch this because I saw it amongst the top 5 anime here on this site and it was also kinda short (24 eps like every good anime I know ^_^). Another reason was that I had read some comments and opinions where people talked about some kind
                  of change in the plot and starting a more serious storyline with mindblowing stuff. Well that is exactly what I was looking for...
As I write to every review, I like DEEP THOUGHTS in anime. Haha, seems like I found another treasure (after Neon Genesis Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Death Note etc...). This anime started like hilarious comedy. I really enjoyed the cute and funny characters and I thought, ‚ÄúHmmm is this the right anime for me?‚Äù (You know I don't like just anime comedy or simply just anime about nothing to think about.) Well things changed after few episodes. 
At first there are some interesting things but insignificant that happened but in time you realize, that those are becoming more and more important and everything is connected. Sometimes you have to think about it afterwards to realize what really happened. (You know how it goes with time travel. Really loved time travel paradoxes in Stargate SG-1. Well you are kinda gonna enjoy them here too.) When the final episodes are close you see the change, you see that things are getting more and more serious and finally you see the clash between reality and human mind. (Really awesome to watch Okarin and his fantasy world dealing with the reality.) I guarantee you that you will find many thoughts worth thinking about.  
The result? I think this is one of the best anime ever made. You can find everything in there including my favorite deep thoughts, science-fiction, comedy, romance, kawaii-moe-otaku stuff :D etc. I would recommend this anime to every anime fan since it is valuable piece and not really focused only for one topic or so. 
Uhhh I am sorry but have to end now. Organization agents are here so I have to time leap again....
E l  P s y  C o n g r o o....",10

                maybe my review looks weird and very beginner
So I'm sorry if you don't like my style of reviewing
oh one more thing, my English is very bad so if there are some things that you don't understand, sorry
I watched this anime without knowing the VN
from the first time I watched the first episode I was very interested
I can't explain why
All my friends that I recommend in this anime always give positive responses
the story is very neat and well structuredthe songs are also very nice and touching
the character designs are also very attractive
if I continue it will probably be very long
the conclusion is this is the best anime (I have ever watched)",10
"
                It‚Äôs perfect when you love science or time travelling skits. It‚Äôs absolutely all about that. xD 
Definitely, this anime is for the Sci-Fi fans. It's literally perfect for them.
Also, Makise Kurisu is hawt. Okay. 
The plot was built amazingly. You won‚Äôt see this and that coming. Totally beautiful, man. The thrill's already building up in the very first episode, and that usually doesn't happen, alright? But I see the story going on like this though: thrilling, slow plot, thrilling, slow plot' kind of thing. Though of course, this is my perspective obviously. 
There are like parts that gives you that feeling where you‚Äôd be like
                  ‚ÄòOI SNAP OUT OF IT MAN‚Äô or like ‚ÄòYUUUS‚Äô or something. Frustration, joy, evilness, etc. Or is it just me? Just me? ‚Ä¶.okay. :c
There aren't really many but I guess in the visual novel there‚Äôll be tons. But in the anime, you may be able to only count it by fingers but I shit you not. They‚Äôre awesome.The OSTs are also genuinely pretty. They are, in fact, very melodic, and it's really a masterpiece. It's so smooth like~~.  :3
Character design and their attitude: are you friggin‚Äô kidding me. It‚Äôs absolutely awesome! Everything fits it. If you tell me Hououin Kyouma and Makise Kurisu is not cool then how could u. ;‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî; idek anymore. But yeah, 10 dr. peppers out of 10 jelly bananas! :3 
As I've said, the pace of the anime for me is quite mixed. But overall, I have clearly enjoyed it. The events were pretty neatly arranged, and the dialogues are just. It's pure genius!",9
"
                Concepts of time and time travel have always been a breeding ground for sci-fi stories and because this is a topic that we have barely come to grasp, it is here where creativity ends up shining the greatest. Now the story is based around a man's seemingly insane personality and his stumble upon a method to change the past and evidently, the future as well. Many things could have gone wrong in the process of writing this story but fortunately for all of us, it was well thought out and executed equally as well.
What you can expect from Steins;Gate is a strongly plot based series
                  building on top of everything that happens starting from episode 1. This means that if you have the time and undivided attention, and a mind that yearns for animes with great stories as well as twists that will keep you on your feet and blow your mind, then this is most certainly a series you have to watch.
But hold on there is more. On top of a well developed story, you get great development of all the characters throughout the series and elements of other genres that will certainly keep you enticed and begging for more. 
In the end, what you get by the time this series is finished is the satisfaction of finishing a great show and when you watch as many animes as I do, the feeling gets harder and harder to come by.",10

                OMGWTFBBQ?! I haven't reviewed my favorite anime because of forgetfulness and procrastination?! FOR SHAME! Well you don't give a crap (usually) what I have to say or any of us reviewers at all actually. As I haven't found a single review that does NOT have a single ""Not Helpful"" view. Well tell me how are we going to be helpful then you ass? Exactly! Then GTFO and stop reading (if you do read our reviews at all which I highly doubt) our reviews and start that anime and figure out for yourself whether its garbage or not. But enough about how your such a spaz.
                  Lets get on with my review. 
STORY: 10 
Since I'm not allowed (as any of us are) to include summaries or spoilers, we can only tell you what we think of it. And personally, JESUS CHRIST OH MY GOD THE STORY IS EPIC! BALL BUSTING PLOT TWISTS! (You might find yourself saying ""WHAT A TWIST!"") PANT'S CRAPPING SETTING! EPIC ****ING CONCLUSION TO WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE IS ONLY THE BEGINNING! A worthy note of caution: You might find yourself constantly changing pants from pissing/shitting yourself to the sheer suspense and excitement you probably will experience just by looking at this anime. No...this is not just an anime, but an outstanding story that is executed beautifully and flawlessly. 
ART: 10
The art is so gorgeous one can not express in words on how perfectly detailed everything is drawn. Down to the tiniest spec, I find everything so miraculously animated it helps bring this genius work of art to life.
SOUND: 10
The music, the voices, the atmosphere! So crystal clear I completely forgot these characters didn't have a voice of their own. Or at least, not one I can hear that is living and breathing proof that it exists and not a figment of your imagination. 
CHARACTER: 10
Did I forget to mention that what we are witnessing here are the actions, motives, and personality traits that belong to what we call a fictional character?  I know. I thought they were real too! D: JK but seriously if you don't fall in love with Kurisu then there is something VERY WRONG WITH YOU!
Regardless if you like tsundere's or not. 
ENJOYMENT: 10 
I found myself screaming at the screen, frequently changing pants then resorting to not wearing any at all, and crying that I had to wait for another spin off or sequel before I can continue the story and see what conclusive answer awaits in the world of Steins;Gate! 
OVERALL: 10
If you do not watch this then you are missing out on one of the best if not the best anime's ever made. Well, what are you waiting for! You can't redo the past like you can in Steins;Gate! GTFO MAL RIGHT NOW AND WATCH THIS SHIT BEFORE SOPA OR SOME OTHER CRAP CENSORS OUR FREEDOMS AND MAKES YOU WISH YOU DID GTFO! GOGOGOGOGO!!!!",10
"
                If you're reading this looking for recommendations and such then you have my approval, go and watch Steins;Gate. The story is engaging, the animation is outstanding and you'll love the characters by the end of the episode. 
Just don't drop it before the 5th episode since it takes that long to get going.
Still here? Ok time for a more in-depth critique UHAHAHAHAHA! (you'll have to get used to this).
Without repeating the full synopsis, Steins;Gate is the story of ""MIRAI GAJETTO LABU"" (future gadget lab) a small group of people inventing useless gadgets, that so happens to create a time machine. The lab leader Okabe Rintarou
                  will have to face all the consequences of time travel such as paradoxes, butterfly effect and such.
Technically, this anime is outstanding. The staff had a really good concept and story to work with and instead of screwing it all up, as has happened too many times in the industry, they succeded in mixing beautiful character designs, awesome voice actors (even though ""Tutturuu~"" was becoming pretty annoying) and beautiful music with one of the best animations I've seen so far.
It's all nice and dandy but there are still downsides I want to address.
First and foremost: Run-up
I like it when a show gives me time to get comfortable with setting and characters before get going with abstract and complicated theories on space-time, but 5 episodes is way to much, even more considering it's set in Akihabara of 5 years ago (2010) which is quite easy to feel immersed in being an ordinary city-scape.
Protagonist-kun
Closing to the resolution of the story, it becomes quite obvious it comes from a visual novel where, based on the player's actions, one of the characters falls in love with the protagonist.
The direction decided to take most (if not all) of the possible ""game-routes"" and animate them giving hints of your usual harem anime. That said, it's quite subtle and they all fit fine in the grand scheme of the story. It just slightly bugged me.
LOUD NOISES!
Everyone of the 3 ""main-main"" characters has a signature noise that's repeated till it gets annoying (Mayushii's ""tutturuu"", Rintarou's laugh and Daru's ""jan""). This combined with self embarassing situations  (""IT'S SO KUURU, YOU SONOFABITCH"") made my-""hyper-empathic""-self want to skip ahead few minutes not to see/hear it.
All in all, as you might have guessed from my ratings, I give Steins;Gate a huge thumb up and recommend everyone watches it, it's fun, it's great conversation topic, and it'll keep your brain working, plus it has just my kind of humor.",8
"
                If this anime is known as ""overrated,"" it deserves it. Do not be fooled if it is known as overrated, it is absolutely remarkable and mind twisting... as well as a must-see. And trust me, there is romance involved. After the first episode, you're probably wondering if it is worth watching any further.... TRUST me, it is definitely worth watching to the very end.
Does it have it's unexplained anomalies? Yes.... and it feels like forever before you make sense of things, BUT that is what makes you feel like it is worth every minute of your time to watch it.
It has it's funny moments but
                  is definitely full of seriousness! It took me a while to finally watch Steins;Gate, but I DEFINITELY have no regrets! It is def part of my top 10!",10
"
                Before the review, I shall give you the series in chronological order!
Steins;Gate eps 1-22: don't you dare watch 23 and 24 yet 
Steins;Gate Alternate 23: watch this one instead of 23 and 24
Steins;Gate 0 1-23: start on the second series
Steins;Gate 23-24: now you can go back to these two Steins;Gate Deja vu movie
This anime wraps it up amazing all the way through. 23 and 24 of the first season can technically be called the episodes 24 and 25 of season 2. The good thing about this series and how this isn't in direct order is the way they planned it out. You assume ""oh well they aren't going to know this and this"" when realistically that is how it is meant to be due to the time travel hocus and pocus throughout the story line. Simply put they did a great job looping it around. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rarely do I ever find an anime that can fully captivate me and produce the same reactions out of me multiple times. This anime was a truly amazing adaptation and one of my favorite anime to date (hence there is bias). I'm not entirely sure when I spoil parts of anime so take that as a fair warning. 
Story - 10
The story is amazing. There are no other ways to describe it, there are plenty of ways to write a story and therefore plenty of ways to mess up. What the author managed here was a flowing story that, although felt confusing at the start became extremely fun and also interesting. Most if not all events can be understood through the extensive watch of both seasons and the movie. 25 (including alternate 23) episodes for this first season was a great choice and did the story justice, I doubt I would have enjoyed this anime nearly as much if it was only 12 or 13 episodes. The story did plot twists extremely well and I was surprised, even through my second run I was against my seat, biting my nails the entire way through. I did hesitate to watch this anime again after the first time. That is because this anime does it so well that it is beyond the point where I feel I can just ""rewatch"" it. I truly loved the story. (trying my hardest not to give spoilers ;) ).
Art - 8
Captivating and unique enough, fits with the story and has great character expressions. 
Sound - 8
It's very good for an anime made in 2011, hence why it gets such a great score. The music fits well and wasn't too sloppy, and the voice acting for the dub was outstanding.
Characters- 10
The characters are where this anime truly shines, the development throughout the entire story is both captivating and heartbreaking. The characters are something that everyone who watches this anime will have a hard time detaching from after watching it. The humor is also outstanding especially with Okabe where you could literally feel yourself cringe to the point it was hilarious. 
Enjoyment - 10
Absolutely outstanding.
Overall - 10
I'd say that I would give this a 9.5 if I could, but I love it WAYY to much. I'd recommend going and watching it now, I was turned off at the start because of the rather strange name, the weird topic, and the strange goopy bananas, but I realize now that, that was a total mistake.",10
"
                Stiens gate is one of the top Anime on this site for a reason it is a masterpiece. I'm not really going to go deep with this one but i will say it is an addicting show you will find yourself wanting more after each episode wanting to find out what happens next in this epic story. There are many twists and turns and the story and characters are so appealing along with character evolution of the lead from bubbling goof to caring human being. great show and defiantly worth checking out if you want some thing smart and keeps you interested the whole way
                  through.",10
"
                If anyone is more late on watching this anime, it's gotta be me. Now that I watched it though, I do not regret it one bit. This show by far is one of the most unique time travel shows I watched ever. Many shows regarding time travel can be a difficult one, as they can easily be done poorly, and alot of times making no sense with a few loopholes as well. The show delivers a very descriptive time travel concept that very much could be possible one day and rewards you for how much attention you give to it. The more you try to
                  understand it the more mind blown you've become. I've always enjoyed watching phycological animes and Steins;Gate seriously hit the spot for me. With that said, welcome to my first ever review on MAL. 
What I absolutely enjoyed about this anime was how important each character was in the show. Every character had a purpose behind them which prevents them from being lackluster. Honestly, I thought the cat girl was there for fan service or maybe comic relief, but her purpose was so much more than that. Through characters like her we realize that one cannot simply grant wishes out of selfishness, as there is always a price to be paid. The most crucial character obviously is none other than El Psy Congroo himself. The painful journey he has undergone as he tries so save his love ones was so impactful I was breathing heavily each episode. Not to mention I replayed moments throughout on parts I was slightly confused about. I personally really felt his struggles and his frustration throughout the show. I actually watched Re:zero before this (also by Studio White Fox and they did a fantastic job on both these shows by the way) and I closely relate these two shows with the strong theme of never giving up no matter what is being thrown at you. If done correctly, I really enjoy this theme and gives me a strong motivation on how life should be lived. This anime is not one that you should be watching while you're preoccupied but more so one where you sit down and really try to understand it's concept and what it has to offer. Like I said, the deeper you understand this storyline the more you end up loving it. In addition to the 24 episodes, I feel like the special episode and the movie are both a must-watch as they explain more of what happens afterwards with the ending of the movie being absolutely mind-blowing in my opinion (you get to know who is Okabe's first kiss haha).
As much as I liked this anime I have but one issue. In my opinion I found the first 10 episodes or so to be extremely slow paced. Perhaps its part of the build up, but the fact they did numerous amounts of the same banana experiment turning green seemed so unnecessary to me. During my watch of the first 10 episodes I was actually close to dropping it for how slow it was but I held on knowing that it was bound to pick up sooner or later (which it did). If I ever rewatch this anime I may considering skipping the first 10 knowing how slow it was. Or maybe I will watch it and might realize how important the episodes were to the plot. Until then I stand by the fact that the pacing was a bit slow in the beginning.
Thats all I have to say in my first review I hope it's not too bad as I don't go that specific like others do in terms of art, sound, etc. Thanks for reading.",9
"
                This is by far one of the best anime series i have ever watched. The start is slow, with about 4-5 episodes not really getting any progress. Once it really kicks in though, it is one of most most heart wrenching series there is. You can't help but truly feel for the characters here; the story, characters and emotions in this series make this a true masterpiece.
I recommend any anime fan watch this must-see series. Yes it starts slow in the first few episodes but it is well worth the wait for what comes next. This anime changed my outlook on many things in life....it
                  is something that I cannot explain, but is simply a series you have to watch and experience for youself.",10
"
                I watched steins gate before two years and still one of the best animes I have ever watched.
I think the story is good and it's really hard to write a completed story like this. (I really respect the writer xD) It talks about a time machine made by the main character Okabe Rintarou. The series is not  about science only . It includes romance , comedy , drama and sad moments too . That what makes it enjoyable.
Main characters are 4 guys 
Okabe Rintaro is the main character. He is kind of crazy guy but that what makes him special character ^^ 
Makse Kurisu
                  is always a scientist . She is so smart . She has a really nice personality.
Shiina Mayuri : A caway (cute) girl . She is the big heart in their group.
Last one is Hashida  Itaru (Daru) as they call him. He is a super Hacker. But he is a real croaker most of the time.
The good thing that makes me like this anime is the end.
I mean it explain everything . Most of animes forgot some points make you wondering what about ‚Ä¶. And ‚Ä¶. ?
Steins gate's end didn‚Äôt make wondering about anything.
Finally, If you love watching anime with unexpected events you should watch steins gate ^^",10

                2# review. This is a review of the whole cumulative show I can see why this show is talked about as an absolute masterpiece. Initially I was skeptical of even watching it as the first episode didn't hook me though I'm so happy I pioneered through and watched the whole series both seasons and the movie. This show is the scaling system, this show is the true definition of a masterpiece.
Story-The story is absolutely outstanding and blew me away almost every single episodes. This is the most brilliant well written story I've ever taken the pleasure to watching and unravelling. The way stuff can be
                  setup and then later referenced is amazing almost having one of those mind blowing moments every episode when something finally clicks and you understand what was meant. This might sound muddled my review as I just finished the movie so my love of this show is at an alltime high. Overall the story throughout the whole show is superb and is an absolute 10/10.
Music-The songs used in this show are masterful. The way they combined the themes and narrative of the show and transferring it into music is superb. Listening to the op's from both seasons and ed's is an absolute treat. The soundtrack throughout each episode is brilliant as well only amplifying the greatness of the well written story and characters. Overall Music is a 10/10.
Characters-The characters in this show are brilliantly well written from mad scientist to his assistants they were all great. No other show has had me tearing up to suddenly smiling from ear to ear due to the characters actions. Some of the greatest scenes of all time have come out of this show, especially ""Spoiler"" when Houinin Kyouma comes back after the time leap wearing his famous coat again equipped with his mad scientist personality, this scene had me genuinely smiling the most I think I have ever had in my life. Overall characters are a 10/10.
Overall- The show just comes together so perfectly in every single season, the first being absolutely brilliant, the second keeping the same quality and the movie doing the same having one of the best endings I have ever witnessed in my life. Overall I love this anime and its steadily approaching my favourite of all time. 10/10 this show is perfection.",10
"
                  Let me preface this by saying:  This is as abbreviated as I could stand to make my review.
  Do you ever find yourself putting on anime or a movie to go to sleep to?  It's something I regularly do.  I call it the ""pass out flick.""  Well, every time I've put on this series as a pass out flick I've gotten sucked in again, and wound up watching at least half of it before getting to sleep.  That is the only way this series is a fail; as a pass out flick!  I just re watched
                  Stein's Gate for the I don't know how many'th time (something I find myself doing with a VERY select few anime.)   After glancing at my profile, it was a surprise to realize I hadn't written a review about it.  Maybe it shouldn't be that surprising since I don't write many reviews.  
  The first few episodes are a little ... well ... slow.  In fact I almost didn't watch the series after the first episode or two.  WHATEVER YOU DO, don't give up.  Stein's Gate develops into an anime worthy of the title masterpiece.  As a work of science fiction it is brilliant.  Incorporating just enough real world fact (or more often theory) to lend the fantasy credibility, and at the same time circumnavigating the stickier issues with such simple explanations that you just naturally accept the path the story takes.  ... ... ...
  Additionally, Stein's Gate is so much more than just a great work of science fiction.  It's also a masterpiece of drama.  Even after re-watching the series so many times there are still scenes that get me teary eyed (again something VERY rare for me in entertainment of any genre not just anime.)   Last and certainly not least.  The series possesses something all to rare in good anime most particularly anime that is good drama; a happy ending. 
  I'm sure at least a select few will enjoy this anime as much as I have.",10
"
                If you're anything like me--pedantic, critical, impatient and an impassioned fan of story-telling, but not necessarily of anime--then the following disclaimer is for you: Hang in there. You will consider dumping this series. You will find yourself bewildered by its acclaim. You will initially chalk its rating up to weeaboos-a-weeabooing and want to move on. 
Wait. Don't do this.
Now, if you're nothing like me and were instantly charmed by this kooky cast of miscreants, count your blessings, I guess? But if you are like me, then you should know exactly what is so frustrating about this series... and why you should watch it anyways.
Part A:
                  What Is So Frustrating About This Series:
The story is a slow burner. Nothing of apparent consequence happens during the first 11 episodes. The characters kind of just tinker around without achieving much other than getting on each other's and the viewers' nerves. There are some vague conspiratorial events, some minor technological progress, but it doesn't amount to much of anything from one episode to the next. 
The first half of the series appears to be largely devoted to character-building, which is unfortunate, because the characters are all extremely annoying people whose defining traits are largely shallow anime archetypes. The men are all horny, immature incels, and the women are all hyper-sexualized cock-teases, and their relationships to one another are based entirely on the stereotype ""Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus"".
So the plot appears to go no where and the characters annoy the shit out of you and each other, however...
Part B: Why You Should Watch It Anyways:
An event occurs at the series's midpoint, after which the show is literally un-put-down-able. Credit where credit is due, all of that apparent nonsense in episodes 1-11 does pay off in subtle, but remarkable ways, and the result of all that meandering is a story that is complex, moving, and engaging. It is a plot that is detailed, tightly-written, and thought-provoking, and to tell you any more about it would be doing you a disservice.  If you choose to pass on it, that's fine, but if you start it, you owe it to yourself to finish it. Maybe even twice.
That said, it only gets a seven because I hate everyone.",7

All and all, I failed to see the beauty of this anime. I really wanted to like it but can‚Äôt that‚Äôs why I continued to watch even after episode 3. Half the show is very boring the second half is good, not worth

                The Best Animation I've seen so far...
This show, is really briliant! 
Steins;gate is an anime that use concept of time travel.
The story follows a young man that called himself a mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma. One day he and his lab member, made a Phone Microwave that can send a D-mail, what happen next? you should watch it yourself. Now then, Let's hear my thoughts.
Story - 10/10
yes, Steins;gate is a time travel story, but, not as a side plot, but AS the main plot, that's what i like from this anime, maybe (for you) the first cour (Episode 1-12) seems boring because it's telling about the
                  MC changing his friends fate by a D-mail, BUT, don't drop until you watched the 13th episode, that episode is the begun to be more serious and the start of the main story, Okabe, is Stuck in the timeloop because he need to save his beloved friends, Mayurii, he need to time leap again, and again to save her, but, he can't change it.
The Story is Amazing, The Execution also briliant, i just can't express it with words... it just, marvelous!
Art - 9/10
The art is Good, The character design is also good, The Animations is smooth. Love it
wait, i'm almost forget, The Opening Video is amazing and when  Okabe doing a Time leap, there's a scene that shows the Divergence Meter, That's amazing!
Sound - 9/10
The Sound is great, I love the Ending song! the Voice Actor is also Amazing they're doing a good job here!
Character - 10/10
The most interesting character I ever seen!
especially, the main Hero and Heroine (Okabe Rintarou and Makise Kurisu)
Okabe is really kind, charismatic, thoughtful, and maybe a Chuunibyou (eight grader syndrome) he's really a good man, he is also a man that never give up and puts effort to everything he does!.
Makise Kurisu, The Main Heroine, is interesting, too!
a Smart Tsundere that always push Okabe to do something.
The Relation between those two, is the one of many best moments at Steins;Gate, They're always help each other to solve their problems.
Enjoyment - 10/10
If you read this review, you're already know that i really enjoyed this show. There aren't many animes that impressed me like steins;gate did. 
The first half is like a normal slice of life anime, but, after the rounders attacked the lab, The story is really more intense, darker than before, and there's even some feels in this anime that make me sad.
Overall - 10/10
I've never seen a masterpiece like this, if you're a anime fans, especially, a Science Fiction Fans, you must watch this shows.
Sorry if my english is really really bad, English isn't my Native Languages!
and Thanks for reading my reviews, Feedback is accepted, too!",10

                Time travel is a very complex subject there is two most popular theory about it. 1) Where changing the past changes the future, 2) changing the past does not change the future, it makes a new timeline or worldline. And I believe the second one is more appropriate. and Suzuha said herself that the grandfather paradox doesn't exist so why did she come to the past knowing that she won't be able to change anything and she will only create new worldlines. How he was able to create a time matching without knowing a single thing about it and how his microwave was able to
                  catch his phone waves without a receiver. Every time he changes past why he remembers everything, I'm not saying that it's impossible it could be done by 'Quantum Entanglement' in that case you have to bring two objects so close together that their quantum-wave functions overlap, then they could only be described as a single two-object quantum-wave function and if you bring them very far apart and don't disentangle them, then they remain connected but it never happened. According to their time travel theory, they are from two different worldlines, and their past after a certain point is completely different but he can't seem to remember what happened in the past after that certain point where he changes the past but according to his friends he lived that particular time so where is his memory from that time. They said that they are only able to send 36 bytes of data in the past but in the time leap how could they able to send a human's memory in the past which is around 2.5 TB. How did he able to undo the D-mails with another D-mail, it only creates another timeline think about it, it's not the timeline he D-mailed himself it was the previous one and they are separated from each other. And some of the episodes and theories contradict each other. This series is full of plot holes if you think about it unbiasedly you will understand what I'm trying to say it's an average show for time passes. If you think my points are wrong or illogical you can explain that I would love to hear that. And what about the worldline where they didn't have the IBN5100(IBM5100 in our world) and still made the time machine, how the hell they decode SERN's data. Now don't tell me they made it possible with their big brain.",4

If you like complex storylines and can handle time paradoxes, Steins;Gate would be a great choice to watch. It is fairly difficult to get into, but after a couple of episodes the show smooths out. The story follows a immature scientist, Rintarou Okabe, as he uncovers a conspiracy with his time machine invention. He works to end this conspiracy while saving the lives of his friends at the same time. Although the show follows a linear trajectory, the circularity of it is noticeable through the side characters, as they cannot remember what happen when time changes. Regardless, the minor characters each have
                  their own identifiable personalities and have importance to the plot.
The art in Steins;Gate is top notch, and it fits the tone of the story well. Both the designs of the characters and backgrounds are among the best of the year, and the color palette allows for the happiest and darkest of moments presented. The music for the show was quite decent. The opening and ending themes, albeit dark, fit the majority of the episodes. The in show sound track did not stand out, in either a good or bad way (and when it did it was always in a good way).
---
Characters - 10
The characters in Steins;Gate are what shaped the show into what it became. The protagonist had a lot of development from the first episode to the end. Rintarou Okabe is far from your ordinary main character. He is a self proclaimed mad scientist, who is always pretending to be paranoid of imaginary secret organizations. In the first few episodes he acts quite childish around his friends, and his experiments are far from successful or meaningful. Although the show has serious tones to it, he does not until the plot progresses (but he is not silly to absurdity). At a point in the storyline, Okabe beset by turmoil and has to solve his problems alone; he begins to become overtly serious, and this does not go unnoticed by the rest of the cast. As the show does not end on a dark note, neither does Okabe. By the end, he leaves his solemn state and returns to how he acted at the beginning. This character development has a powerful effect, as the storyline is very circular; Okabe is the only character who perceives the story as being linear, but his personality changes still emphasize the circularity.
The secondary characters of the show do not get as much development as the protagonist. Although this is bad, it makes sense. Every single one of these characters does not follow the linear direction of the show. As they cannot remember many of the major plot events as Okabe does, they had no reason to change as the story progresses.
The fact that the side characters have no development does not make them bland. They each have a sense of individuality, and they can be identified by their personality traits. You have the close friend who is an overweight computer hacker; he never hesitates to overtly express his erotic interests and teases the female characters often this way. There is the childhood friend who is a very childish young woman; she seems to be an airhead, but at times she appears to be more aware of everything going on than even the protagonist. There is a bashful shrine maiden who is actually a trap. Another is an energetic girl who is always found working hard with any task given to her; nearly all series long she is mysterious, even when she reveals that she a ‚Äúgenius‚Äù and ‚Äúin the know‚Äù. There is a rich girl who works at a maid caf√© for the fun of it and speaks like a cat. Lastly an extremely reserved woman, who communicates mainly through text messages, fulfills the role of a temporary lab member.
Story - 9
It is difficult to describe the story of Steins;Gate without ruining the majority of it. For lack of better terms, the plot was highly chaotic. This is completely inevitable when dealing with a time machine and time loop storyline. The show follows Okabe as he is working on his homemade time machine. As the design of the machine is very simple and it functions unpredictably, the first half of the season covers the experiments using it. The more experiments that Okabe does, the more his world changes and the more danger he puts himself and his friends into. The second half of the season follows Okabe as he attempts to return the world back to the way it was and save the lives of his friends.
The scheme of Steins;Gate was quite complex, as the story was filled with multiple side plots that were crucial to the overarching plot. Complex stories can make or break a show, and the directors appeared to have thought everything though. Each subplot was resolved without leaving the viewer with a multitude of questions. Also, almost none of them were rushed; the writers took their time and kept the pacing smooth. Only the very final plot point seemed rushed, and had the shot had one or two more episodes this could have been averted. Even though the ending felt faster paced than the rest of the series, it does not ruin the quality of the rest of the episodes. There is just no buffer between the final two arcs of the show, and because of this some of the events towards the end seem like a deus ex machina (which is ironic considering what happens, and when you get to that point you‚Äôll understand).
The story does not feel like the best I‚Äôve ever seen, which is why I haven‚Äôt given it a ten. It might be because of the ending, but it is also an instinctual thing. If you are considering picking up the show, I would definitely suggest it if you like time paradoxes. It is very hard to get into, but it smooths out after a couple of episodes. I should also make a point that it can get very dark, and I think it may be the darkest show of the year (even more so than Madoka, but that is my opinion). The good thing is that it does have a happy ending.
Art - 10
I am a stickler for art, and I will sometimes pick up terrible shows because it has good art and drop amazing shows because I can‚Äôt stand the crayon scribbles. In the case of this show, I was intrigued by the banner art when I was reading the summery towards the beginning of its release. I was astounded by the visuals; the characters were well drawn and so were the backgrounds. If I had enough time to do so, I could pause an episode and just marvel at all the details put into the background and even the characters.
Steins;Gate doesn‚Äôt have the best art I‚Äôve seen, but it is pretty close. The style of art used for the show fits the tone of the storyline perfectly. When things are happy, the colors are light and calm. When things become dark, everything seems dismaying and terrifying at the same time without the overall color palette changing. It is by far the best art I‚Äôve seen in the past few seasons, and that is why I gave it such a good score in this field.
Music - 9
The opening and ending of Steins;Gate do not change until the final few episodes. I like it when shows change their themes after twelve or thirteen episodes, but in this case I didn‚Äôt mind. Both the opening and ending, although not the most impressive songs devised, fit the show splendidly. They were dark but energetic; sad but lively at the same time. They fit the tone of the show, regardless if the plot was currently in the happiest or darkest points. On top of that the themes were high quality; I found that I could add them to my playlist and listen to them without the urge to skip them (which is a feat indeed).
I‚Äôm glad the show stuck with the opening all the way through and only changed their ending for the final three episodes; with how the storyline functioned, I think it would have been odd for theme to have randomly changed. When the endings changed, it made perfect sense. ‚ÄúFake Verthandi‚Äù added an extra layer of suspension to the end of episode 22, being both dark and depressing yet hopeful at the same time. ‚ÄúSky Clad no Kansokusha‚Äù powerful beat and base lines reinforce Okabe‚Äôs determination at the end of episode 23. ‚ÄúAnother Heaven‚Äù had a slightly different tone from all the other endings, that matched the ending to the series. All of these endings worked for their specific roles. The original ending was the best of them all, as the final three where not as musically sound. The differences were minimal, and the new ones fit well enough that I have minimal complaints.",9

Steins;Gate : 10/10
Steins;Gate was my top 1 for ten years, but since 2018 I've been reluctant to put Yorimoi in first, but today, 08/06/2021, I decided to leave Steins;Gate in second after loving and seeing Yorimoi so much... I could write a 20 page review, but it's just a review that half a dozen people read.
About the plot itself, at first it's kind of slow, but it has to be slow to introduce the characters and you care about them when the story really begins, when it started I couldn't stop seeing, a more powerful episode than the other, overall it is a sad story
                  in short, the beginning is lively but the middle to the end is complicated but the ending is good, not the happy type but things get ""good"", in some moments the heart even tightens So tense that things are... About the characters, everyone is well-built (and then kind of rambunctious), has a well-made background, an established personality (not in a predictable way), very interesting internal / external conflicts, and one of the most important things, MOMENTS VERY GOOD, it's no use for the character to be super well done and just be used to do nothing with nothing or just take it forward. The technical requirements are impeccable, soundtrack, animation, features, everything perfect.
Finally, the ending is pretty cool, there's an extra and cool episode. I find it very innovative, both for the time it was released and for today, it's not a silly clich√© about ""strength of friendship"" or love, in short, it's a Masterpiece, it was really great to see, worthy of 10/10...",10
"
                I'm not one to give 10s out to everything; there are plenty of 3's and 4's on my list. I'm also not one to binge watch any show, so it should speak volumes when I say I watched all 25 episodes within 24 hours.
Story (10): I really want to stress this- the DUB is worth watching. They don't skip out any of the scenes, and the story is very dialogue heavy. I watched the first two episodes with subtitles, but found myself being overwhelmed trying to read everything as it happened. That being said, the story is fantastic. Not a single line lacks importance, and
                  some scenes (such as the dating scene omg) had me crying with laughter. There are scenes that also really hit you right in the feels, and it's all a roller coaster where you root for Okarin the whole time!! A little convoluted at times, but hey, it's about time travel for gods sake!
Art (9): I would probably give this a 10 if I had watched it in higher quality, but the site I used was limited to like 480p. But the characters spring to life, the environments are vivid and detailed. 
Sound (8): the soundtrack never really blew me away, but it never seems to intrude and was always effective at setting the tone and supplementing the scene.
Characters (11): yeah. 11. There wasn't a single character that lacked depth and emotion. The main character's mad scientist persona always serves to break tension when necessary, and never undermines the plot or the mood. Okarin was fantastic, but I also loved Daru, Mayuri, Kurisu, and even the shop owner who was Okarin's landlord with a tough exterior. I would gladly watch a show that featured any of the supporting characters.
Enjoyment (10): like I said, I never binge watch, and I did with this one. that's all I gotta say
Overall, I would absolutely give this show a 10, as it is truly a masterpiece. It never drags on, makes you love the characters, has a fantastic plot, and a great ending. I also imagine that rewatching the show will give me something new, given that it is about time travel and there may be subtleties that will make sense once you've already watched it. But to do that, you have to see it the first time, so go watch it right now!!!!",10

                I really like this anime so much that I feel compelled to make a review.
As an avid time-travel related work connoisseur(not really), there are several reasons why I think this anime is sublime.
Shall we delve deeper into my mind then? Here goes:
The story was amazing because first, the main driving force of the anime itself, the idea is unique. Second, the story was revealed in such a way that you can really feel the ups and downs. If I should compare it, I guess I would compare it to listening to an orchestra playing music.
Art wise I don't have any problem with it, and considering
                  it's been out for quite a while it's pretty solid compared to anime nowadays.
The characters were very memorable, the relationships between them, their development and motivations seemed very natural and were clearly shown in the show. For example the main character was very immature at the start but he slowly became more mature later on and I can see the transformation. I feel as though it's really easy to connect with them and it's not due to their lack of depth.
Another strong point for this anime is how the background music really suits the situations. They always seem to add more weight to help the narrative. 
I thoroughly enjoyed Steins;Gate, I would definitely recommend this if you enjoy sci-fi, time-travel, and stories which carry weight. I don't think this series is in anyway inferior to some big budget Hollywood movie, in fact I believe it's quite the opposite.
Beware the first few episode you might feel just as in the dark as the main character, but when you get it, it will take off. If you don't like stories which makes you think, or you're looking for something light, I don't think Steins;Gate might suit you.
I hope this review has been useful, and if you do intend to watch Steins;Gate, enjoy!",10

                SPOILERS AHOY!  Of all shows you could watch, this show is one of the most easily spoiled.  It's ranked so high for a reason, go watch it.
Steins;Gate is, without a doubt, one of the finest stories I‚Äôve ever experienced.  It‚Äôs definitely in the top ten, maybe even in the top five.  Everything fit, it used time travel in a way I was completely satisfied with (!!!), and most important of all, it had a fantastic and fitting ending.  
Like all the best endings, it tied up loose ends in a direct way (not making up for lost time and rushing
                  it), it ended the series‚Äô main point in a satisfying way, and best of all, most wonderful of all, it was happy in a way that it deserved to be.  This was definitely an Earn Your Happy Ending story, but those are often extremely satisfying.  
Okay, so‚Ä¶summarizing this show is impossible.  I was never truly confused by the plot, but the meanderings of the time traveling and world-line jumping are far too complex to describe, even at length.  I would do this magnificent story an injustice to even attempt it.  
This show is ranked right behind FMA: Brotherhood, and it deserves its place.  I personally think Brotherhood is the superior story, but only by the slightest bit (it‚Äôs longer, has action, a great plot, and ends equally well).  
What really satisfied me was the inclusion of an OVA.  The visual novel source material ends with the events of episode 24.  While ambiguous, the ending appears satisfying in that medium.  For a show, however‚Ä¶it definitely needed more.  The popularity of the show was apparently enough to warrant the writers‚Äô creation of the perfect conclusion: episode 25.  
I love bookends, and this episode included one of the best (‚Äúclose your eyes‚Äù), and it even tied up the loose end of who Suzuha‚Äôs future mother will be.  While not truly necessary, this episode developed the new relationship between Okabe and Kurisu.  It was also nice to see that Moeka (Shining Finger) ended up in a good place.  The most important loose end, for me, was the ambiguous ending between Okabe and Kurisu.  It was hinted at the end of episode 24 that she retained some of her memories from the world line in which she loved Okabe, but that was all.  Nothing conclusive, and I like conclusive endings (sometimes they don‚Äôt work as well, but still).  The final scene in the OVA between Okabe and Kurisu left no doubt, and the music theme we heard before, and the fade to black before she tells him to close his eyes, just like the old world line‚Ä¶ah!  It was beautiful.  It was one of the most satisfying, completely happy endings I‚Äôve ever seen, if not the best.  It is so hard to pull off a happy ending that feels justified and where everything is set right again, and the character‚Äôs arcs are complete.  Steins;Gate joins the ranks of those rare stories to pull it off.  These characters *earned* their happy ending.
The music, that incredible opening, the dubbing, the complex yet well-handled story, the sci-fi elements handled so well, the deep and interesting cast, the suspense, the creeping dread from episode 11, the triumphant ending of episode 24, and the quiet ‚Äòreturn to the Shire‚Äô ending of episode 25.  All of it.  10/10.  I am confident that this story will forever remain one of my most cherished stories.",10
"
                If you haven't watched Steins;Gate, you need to right now. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and feel it is a deceptively well-rounded series. If you are still unsure despite all the high-rating reviews already on here, I hope my input may contribute to swaying you in the right direction. 
Story: 10/10
Where do I even begin! After watching Steins;Gate you really question beginnings. Centred around altering the lines of time, similar stories around the same area can really lose you. It can get complicated fairly quickly especially since we aren't all science buffs in such a niche scene. This is why Steins;Gate does it so right!
                  Do not be put off as despite only 24 episodes, they really put the time in for you to follow. Additionally, there are also main characters in the series who do not understand any of the many complicated concepts and thus time is given for both you and these characters to get up to speed. This component of the anime can be somewhat tedious to people who don't enjoy excessive world/character-building and this is relatable to an extent, however, Steins;Gate also incorporates a moderate sense of humour amongst the characters with references to pop-culture including other animes. Topped with the protagonists overbearing desire to perpetuate his make-believe world (at the beginning I wasn't sure if everything he was saying was actually serious and relevant to the overall story, it was really fun hearing how elaborate he could make things out to be), the first 10 or so episodes are quite enjoyable before shit really hits the fan. From there we are just absolutely served plate after plate. Jam-packed with lots of full-circle realisations and griping moments you won't realise you finished the anime until you just do. 
Art: 8/10
This isn't anything new. It was by far the weakest point of Steins;Gate but I'm not even mad. It had a much lower-budget and even then, they really worked with what they had and all I can say is DO NOT be put off by the bleak, dull colours and sub-par art. It ends up becoming extremely fitting. If this was anymore bright and colourful the seriousness of the overall plot would be lost.
Sound: 10/10
I don't remember having any issues with misplaced music or lack of it. I do remember my feelings being enhanced by some well-placed tracks. Some which made me feel very on edge and most notably some which let the floodgates of my eyes overflow. The voice-acting was top-notch! A solid protagonist with great variation through the phases of his emotions. Other honourable mentions include Mayushii's whole character and Moeka's screeching for her phone, she really went 0-100 real quick. 
Characters: 10/10
Some impeccable character development without a doubt. You feel so much growth amongst all the characters. Seeing the protagonist lose his delusional self to the harsh grips of his new realities was so interesting and upsetting. This was further complimented by Mayushii's ability to read her surrounding and Okarin's suffering. There was a bit of greyzone with the outcome of the relationships created toward the area but looking back I can recognise hints toward what happened. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
By the end of it I was extremely satisfied. I felt at a lot of times, ""I wonder how they will get out of this terrible situation"". And I am absolutely shook that they managed to do so every time. Steins;Gate could have easily disappointed me but it didn't and I don't think it will disappoint you either. 
Overall: 10/10",10

                I'll admit, it's been a while since I've seen this one but I remember slogging through this anime hoping it would get better and it never did. Everyone was saying it was so good, and let me tell you folks, this show is garbage. 
The biggest sin this anime commits is in its boring, stereotypical characters. The only character I actually like is Mr. Braun and the MC is okay as well. He's really not as funny as everyone will tell you, however. Everyone else exists just to make otakus feel better about themselves. You got your typical  harem-trope girls: life-long friend who's still
                  childish at heart, gender-bender, feminine guy etc. I really hate the red haired girl who you're supposed to like because she goes on 2chan. I'm sure all the weebs at home get a big kick fantasizing about shit-posting with her on 4chan.
The time-travel stuff I don't remember all that well, but I'm pretty sure it was just your typical ""a new dimension is created when you time-travel,"" stuff and I don't think anything interesting happens with the time-travel aspect. If I re-watched this anime (which I never will), who knows maybe there would be something cool in this part of the show, but I think I'd be too bored to tears to actually pay attention like how it was the first time. Mostly, this show is just a dating sim with nothing charming going for it. 
The art is fine, nothing to talk about. It's mostly just talking-heads, but again why watch a show where almost nothing happens and you hate the characters?
I was thinking about giving it a '2' because it's true that this anime is not offensive with fan-service or hentai or anything like that, but then I remembered I'd never watch or review a show like that, so you can assume that any show like that automatically gets a ""0.""",1

                Steins Gate
First off I would like to state that if you are interested in any type of Sci Fi anime this is the Anime for YOU.
More than anything the plot of the story never drags on and is always fresh material every episode.
The atmosphere of the story is complicated enough that it's not dull but not so much that it's confusing, in my opinion the perfect amount.
The sudden twists that come along are mostly unpredictable and interesting.Truthfully I'm a manga guy, I never really watched too much anime, but this really caught my eye and I truly enjoyed it. Give it a try
Story 10/10 perfection in my eyes
Art 10/ 10 
Sound 9/10 catchy but perfect sound is almost impossible to find
Character 10/10 
Enjoyed 10/OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                This isn't much of a review as it is more of an observation. I believe that this anime is loved by a lot, as can be seen by its dramatic increase of high ratings, because of the  many of the recent animes that's being put out are really disappointing. BUT, this does not change the fact that its still a great anime.
The review. There is nothing to review here, the show is just too damn good that it really doesn't need any justification for why you should watch it. I would just like to comment on the slow paced beginning for it might lose
                  some viewers, I promise you that this will pick up and when it does, you'll will love it.",10

                Steins;Gate inflicts damage upon your mind as the warping of parallel universes occur.The story of Steins;Gate was absolutely amazing. I really liked the idea of using actual time travel theories(cosmic string theory and wormhole theory).The story is very exciting as Okabe Rintarou, no my bad, Houin Kyouma, as he calls himself, experiments with ways to make time travelling possible. In the depths of this time paradox, he and his lab members, go through many obstacles together and run from a wicked experimental organization, SERN.Il go no further than saying you will absolutely love this anime.It might pick us slow in the beginning, but the execution
                  is mind blowing.
This is the story of Steins; Gate!",10
"
                I'm the kind of person who would never, ever give anything a perfect score. Games, Movies, Anime, pretty much everything I can find flaws and problems with it. But I found it really difficult to find anything at all negative to say about Steins;Gate.
I absolutely loved the characters. The story was really engaging, and when a character felt panicked or sad, you felt it too. I found myself tearing up many, many times throughout the anime. 
The only thing that I could nit pick at is that nothing feels permanent. There are some characters who will go unnamed that I think should not have been
                  able to be undone, but I think that that is part of what made the story so rich and enchanting.
This is the ONLY anime that I have ever seen that will ever get a 10/10 for me. They did absolutely nothing wrong with this show. After watching the last episode, I felt that emptiness inside that you get when an amazing thing comes to an end. That is how I judge whether an ending was good or not. If the ending left me thinking, ""What is there to do now?"" after watching it, the feeling that you've lost your sense of direction I know that it was a fantastic ending.
I have high hopes for the movie that is aparently in production. Steins;Gate is now my favourite anime I have ever watched and I don't see anything knocking it down from its pedestal anytime soon.",10
"
                Definitely one of the best Sci-Fi Anime ever created.
Let's begin the story by how hesitant I was to try this Anime since a long time ago, probably because it didn't appear that catchy to me at first. However from times to times, the Anime has been quite well-known and highly recommended by the internet people. So I decided to dive into the Anime to see if it's really a great piece of work. 
After going through about 25% of the Anime, it appeared to be pretty normal and not that interesting. From what I could see was mostly the continuous introduction of new characters and
                  some laboratory works on the mystery that had taken place there. But as the story went on, it began to get more intriguing as more mysteries taking places in the laboratory. Later, at around half of the story, when the mad scientist Okabe as well as his lab members successfully created the time machine, it is almost unbelievable that the pace was getting intense and making me believe that the half of the story was to lay groundwork for the series of events later. A lot of events related to time-leap and time-travel then started to take places, the psychological and emotional aspects of Steins,Gate began mixing up making you unable to take your eyes and minds of the events. So if you really get there, you wouldn't reject that Stein;Gate is an amazing piece of work. 
If you are looking for an amazing piece of work related to Sci-Fi and Psychology, you are at the right place. Don't let the first few episodes fool you, the interesting parts of the story will come later and amaze you.",9
"
                Steins;Gate is the best anime I ever seen. Why? I'll tell you.
STORY - 10/10
The story is the main focus of this anime. It's no surprise that this is an adaptation of visual novel that carries the same title. It may be slow at first, but a single action trigger that unexpected and chain of events. It's explicited how they put their blood on this. It's simply outstanding.
ART - 10/10
The animation is in the hands of the studio White Fox. I must admit I've never heard of this studio since I watched this. The animation in the first eight episodes are a bit ""low-budget"", but you
                  can see that they were saving this to use in the 12 later episodes, where the REAL DEAL starts! You'll be AMAZED!
SOUND - 10/10
The soundtrack is simply marvelous! Every piece of song in the OST album fits PERFECTLY in the PERFECT moment, increasing DRASTICLY the drama scenes, comedy scenes, etc. And so is the sonoplasty.
CHARACTER - 10/10
Along with the story, the characters are the focus here. Every character you find have a back story, a well-developed past, and none of this interfere with the main plot. You'll surely find one to identify with. I can say that Okabe is pretty much me.
ENJOYMENT - 10/10
Well, what can I say to my FAVORITE anime?! It's simply marvelous. The BEST experience I could have with an anime! Of course I played the game after it. YOU MUST WATCH THIS AMAZING ANIME!!
OVERALL - 10/10
MUST WATCH!!",10

                Stein;gate is a very loved anime and this is not exaggerated like in other anime.
The story basically without give any spoiler is about okabe rintarou(or okabe or psy congroo or hououin kyouma(that is my favorite) or ""mad cientist"" (like himself says many times) triyng to make time travels possible and other experiments that he have like  a prototype of a drone this can look few things but is the maximun that a can give withouth give spoilers believe in me the story is emotional will make you laugh and cry in some parts.
The art is very much good the animation and the design of
                  the characters are awesome the anime have a gray tone that is very much well used mainly on the sad scenes .
The sound is another good point same being the less better point its like if everything would 10 and him is 9,8, The opening of the anime is very good not is the best of the universe but is really good the same for the ending and for the musics while the anime mainly the musics in the sad moments it really make the anime more good.
The characters are awesome, you will really love them they have a impressive charisma and this a excelent point mainly because the anime have less of 11 characters and this is not a bad point for the contrary is a very much good point because the author knew how use all of them.
The enjoyment is another excelente point this anime is one of that anime that you say ""This is the last of today"" and watch more of ten after of this it's really good this point.
For finally finish this review the anime is really a masterpiece he simplely do not have any defects you can try to find but you won't reach any i recomend that you go watch the most fast possible so please JUST DO IT.",10
"
                This series is absolutely outstanding.
The subject of time travel is very deep and they make every episode of this anime interesting by uncovering the mysteries of time travel. The anime itself is a masterpiece because the art, sounds, story are really well done. Character development is really in depth and not a single character is left forgotten.
The series have really nice beginning which gets you into the anime really fast because of the unknown factor. After seeing the first episode you don't really know what to expect, as the story goes on it does a perfect job explaining everything and covering every single part.
This is
                  why I consider this absolute Anime Masterpiece.",10

                [SOME SPOILERS AHEAD ARE NEEDED FOR REVIEW PURPOSES: READ AT YOUR OWN PERIL]
I liked Steins;Gate. It was decent. For the most part, the experience was enjoyable; however, I don't agree with the hype or gushing praise that surrounds the anime. My feelings towards S;G are somewhat mixed - though they lean more towards the positive end of the spectrum - therefore I'm going to whip out my favourite review format in order to express how I truly felt about the anime. So put down your fistful of dollars, and be prepared to witness the run down of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of
                  Steins;Gate.
THE GOOD:
1. The development of Okabe Rintarou's character. For about 8 episodes, the main protagonist of S;G was one of the most annoying characters I have ever encountered in fiction. He was an egomaniac with an ""evil genius"" complex. Annoying and incredibly immature, Okabe grows from a guy who likes to do weird stuff in his Mother's basement into a proper adult who is relatable on a human level. His emotional struggle and the sacrifices he has to make in order to right his wrongs, completely destroys the fa√ßade of his character forcing him to see the world for all of its true ugliness. By the end of S;G, we get a jaded, somewhat passive, man who is completely disillusioned by his own delusions and  what the future holds and is just trying to make the most of the present. I never thought I'd say it, but by the end of S;G I ended up really liking Okabe.
2. Mayuri. She really proves why she's the most important person in Okabe's life. She's essentially a major part of his personality and we probably wouldn't get to see him develop so rapidly if it wasn't for her. Unlike the rest of the characters, Mayuri's perspective isn't influenced by science. She's not constantly looking at things from a scientific point of view or trying to analyse people as if they were machines. She might not understand what Okabe or Kurisu (the main female protagonist) have to say all the time, but she understands people's personalities better than anyone else. Mayuri is able to detect a slight change in behaviour, and from that she provides truly beautiful advice that isn't pulled out from some psychologist's study of personality or emotional disorders, but comes from her relationship with the characters. She's fleshed out so realistically that she comes across as being almost human - it makes sense as to why Okabe holds her dear.
3. The voice acting. I don't think there was a single weak member of the cast: everybody captured the personality of their character perfectly well. Miyano Mamoru was especially outstanding as Okabe - he captured his transition from complete immature idiot to a grown men who has gone through hell and back for the ones he loves perfectly. I still can't believe he's the same guy who voiced psychopath Light in Death Note, though, because the characters sound completely different. Hanazawa Kana was perfect - as per usual - as Mayuri: she brought a real childlike innocence to the character with a lyrical, yet emotional, performance. She, once again, proved why she's one of my all-time favourite seiyuus.
Now that my praise for this anime has come to the close, it's time to move on to the more interesting part of my review -
THE BAD:
1. The pacing. S;G suffers from some pretty bad pacing for the first 8-9 episodes of its run. I was tempted to drop it, had it not been for the encouragement of my friends, because it gets off to a really slow start. I'd say the first half a cour is really boring and a struggle to get through with the pacing also slowing down near the end of show. A better director would have resulted in a higher score.
2. The plot-holes. There were a lot of plot-holes regarding how time leaping and D-mails actually work - especially during the later parts of the show. The writers didn't even bother to gloss them over, they just ignored them.
3. Character development of the supporting cast. Characters aside from Okabe were barely developed - which includes Mayuri despite my love for her - this probably has something to do with the fact that every time Okabe time leaped, he was the only one who retained his memories. Therefore, whilst Okabe kept growing, everyone else returned to their original states and just remained one dimensional. It made it difficult for me to sympathise with a lot of the characters - especially the shows main female lead, Kurisu. I also found a lot of their actions to be quite unexpected because there was no development to justify what they were doing, they just did it for the sake of driving the plot. Which brings me onto my next point...
4. The romance. It. Did. Not. Make. Any. Sense. Whatsoever. Where, in between constantly time leaping in order to make sure Mayuri didn't die, did Okabe and Kurisu find the time to fall in love with one another? I mean, it can't have been before shit hit that fan because my observations told me these two developed nothing more than an awkward friendship. When Okabe said he loved Kurisu I actually burst into laughter because it was so freaking random. There had been no prior hints to suggest that those two loved each other, and the love was even less realistic coming from Kurisu's side because she would lose her memories every time Okabe leapt through time! I was just left really confused by the totally unrealistic romance and I really think S;G would have been better off without it.
5. Makise Kurisu: I just don't like tsundere characters. I find the inherent dishonesty of their personalities off-putting. Kurisu isn't the worse tsundere I've encountered, but she's annoying and I don't like her.
THE UGLY:
There wasn't anything abominably bad about Steins;Gate except for the animation and art. Everyone was fug and the animation was pretty cheap. Some of the shots just really sucked, and I hated just saying the mouth move on characters during conversations with only slight camera pans. The small budget that the anime has really, really shows. I got used to it after a while, but I know some people find ugly anime a big turn off.
Oh yeah, the original ending also sucked ass pretty bad and was a steaming pile of deus ex machina (therefore I recommend skipping it entirely and just watching the alternative episode 23).
---
To reiterate, I liked Steins;Gate and I thought it was decent. However, it was definitely not without its flaws. They did have an effect on my enjoyment experience - especially at the beginning - therefore I believe that my 7/10 score is definitely justifiable. But, hey, this is just my view on the matter and if you're a fanboy/girl who believes that I'm wrong - go ahead and drop me a line.",7
"
                Marathoned in one sitting. Worth every second.
Story - 
Story is believable and interesting. One main critique that people seem to have is that the first half is so slow. Personally I found this half to be much lighter and funnier with a focus on character introductions and initial development. It spent a good amount of time letting you get to know each character and work out their relations to each other. The second half is a lot darker but the main character develops well with it and there was never a lull in plot development. The sci fi elements were explained well and seem plausible
                  rather than ""totally"" out of this world.
Art - Top notch. Character designs, locations and lighting are brilliant. One of the best looking animes to watch.
Sound - Great opening track and the soundtrack throughout is very good.
Characters - Main character is amazing. One of the best in anime. Part of his charm is his madness and I spent the first 3 to 5 episodes just trying to work out if he was mental or an actual scientist. Each character is developed and fleshed out and their relations between each other are great. Together they perform amazingly and it would not work without each of them.
Top notch anime, flawless in my opinion and should not be missed!",10
"
                Steins;Gate is one of those anime where you are scratching you're head for the first 12 episodes and then becoming completely blown away by the remaining episodes. A slow build for sure, starts off this series about a group of teenagers who accidentally discover that their phone has the ability to send text messages into the past. This will start a chain of events that eventually lead to some disastrous consequences. The characters here are all lovable. From the MC Okabe to his ""'hostage"" Mayuri, the so called ""hack"" Hashida and the genius Makise - all of them have a great narrative arc that makes
                  you sad to leave the world by the time the last episode rolls around.
I can't recommend this anime enough. Along the lines of ""Cowboy Bebop"" I would say this is an anime that becomes something else entirely. The ability to transcend the anime genre is nothing to take lightly, but this is a show for EVERYONE to see at least once. 
So if you're a fan of science fiction - specifically time travel - than definitely give this anime a shot. At only 24 episodes, its easy to get through and after a plot shattering episode near half way through, you'll be hooked until the end.",10
"
                I had watched the anime some years ago and remember being soooo bored of it; the ONLY thing I remembered when I saw Steins Gate 0 released. I looked at my rating and had seen that I had given it ‚ÄúFair‚Äù and saw that the average rate of the anime exceeded 9 and wondered why? So I thought since I was much younger when I had watched it ‚Äúnot a teen though‚Äù; thart I could have missed something. 
I started watching Steins Gate 0 but noticed I almost remember NOTHING AT ALL of the main story except of how skeptical and illogical it had made
                  me feel so I thought I will re-watch Steins Gate 1st Season along with the movies and OVAs to actually be more fair. So here‚Äôs my thoughts
(spoiler alert)
- I saw one review saying that the anime is meant to make you feel it‚Äôs clever when it‚Äôs actually dumb and I actually happen to feel the exact same way. I understood everything they were trying to imply in the anime yet fail to think it‚Äôs logical at all; regardless of the fact of the science fiction itself; the events and characters contradict themselves way too much in the anime. You just have to pretend to be dumb - like I did- to push forward and not to think of the irregularities. Like no matter what course of action he takes, whether or not he exists the result is that the time machine gets created.
- Sending D-Mails was supposedly able to change everything ‚Äúi.e. return Feryis‚Äô dead father to life‚Äù so why wasn‚Äôt it able to help prevent Mayuri from dying?! He tries time-leap first and fails doing so since it doesn‚Äôt change the past he only retains the memories, right? But initially he had the ability to retain those memories so WTH! And even if time leap didn‚Äôt help the D-mail should‚Äôve so why they were ending up with the same result? If it is fate was the limitation then the same should‚Äôve been right about Feryis‚Äô father!
- the anime actually drifts from the LOGICAL scientific explanation of so many things and focuses on that somehow the microwave ended-up being a time machine that jellifies things and people >> which somehow someday is perfected by Kurisu and is patented to her ‚Äúmother of time-machine‚Äù when in fact SERN were researching it WAYYYYYYYYY back! 
So the anime just wants to focus on the ‚Äúdrama and tragedy‚Äù part instead when the protagonist tries and fails to save his childhood friend; and the ‚Äúromance‚Äù of his love story with Kurisu and how he was desperately trying to save her.
- Okarin was OK causing the death of Feyris‚Äô father by returning back to the actual world event ,, but somehow is not okay with Kurisu dying (since it was fated for her in that actual world).
- I could also mention the illogical things that were in the movie when ACTUALLY ‚ÄúOkarin‚Äù was supposed to be forgotten and actually Kurisu decides to respect his wish to forget about him instead of leaping back and forth and ends up inventing the time-machine because she was contradicting herself >> but Suzu comes from the future and guides her how to do so .. SO HOW DID SUZU KNOW ABOUT HIS EXISTANCE? Everyone else but Kurisu forgot about him and she decided not to let anyone use the machine!
- I could speak about all the illogical things going on in the anime; since it‚Äôs scifi the least I would expect is that the events make sense in their connection with one another, which by the way they don‚Äôt. I feel like they just wanted to reach some goals at the end of the story and no matter how ‚ÄúF*cked‚Äù the events felt on the way to doing so .. it didn‚Äôt really matter! So why care about logic!",5
"
                What can I say about Steins;Gate that hasn't already been said? It was marvelous! This is the kind of show that sets standards for how any time travel/visual novel adaptation should be. Now that being said, it's not everyday you find a show that is about both time travel and was adapted from a visual novel. This show was pioneering and set bars in the process. Now I'm not just going to praise the show though, there were times where I felt like a certain plot point was a bit of a stretch or things could have been done a little more... elegantly. Other than
                  that though... I have no complaints. The show had me laughing one second and then on the edge of my seat at the next. This is a rare gem to find nowadays so you'd be a fool not to watch this show if you have means.",9
"
                This anime has to be the number one anime in my heart. 
Most anime i watch feel like they are missing something, then i find one that feels complete. With Steins;Gate i felt that the anime was not only complete but a master piece. i hesitate to call anything masterpieces because in my eyes a masterpiece has 0 flaws what so ever. which this anime had 0. i have yet to find an anime that meets the standards in which this anime has sent for me. the only complaint i could have with this anime is that it makes other anime look bad because of
                  how perfect it is to me. Not only was the character development perfect but the story, how they played out the story, and how they finished the story were just beautiful. they tooks something that could of been easily bad or trash and made it into a diamond. great anime would recommend to anyone and everyone i know whether they watch anime or not.
Easily my favorite two characters (okabe,Makise), story, and development of any anime out there.",10
"
                In light of the swath of well written reviews, I feel this review only reinforces what the consensus of the community is about this anime: it's fun! Reminds me of the movie: Project: Almanac.
Story - 9. Fun time travel narrative. Got a little confused/lost a few times as to their purpose for their travels. But the rest of the story is easy enough to follow. Also paced well. Didn't feel too fast or too slow. 
Animation - 8. Good, but nothing ground breaking. 
Sound - 8. Decent. Music didn't play a large role in playing with emotions. Felt like this was a good thing. 
Character
                  - 8. I think quite a few reviewers have mentioned how the main protagonist was really the only person who developed over the course of the the story. All other characters were kind of flat sidebars, without breaking their typecast persona. However, this could be a good thing as the story does not delve into unnecessary side-stories.
Enjoyment - 9. I bore easily of run-of the-mill Jap anime. I've even quit many shows mid-season! However, Steins;Gate grabbed my attention from the start and held it. However, at the risk of getting crucified by fellow fans, I felt like we could have done without episode 24.
Overall - 8. What is there left to say? Do yourself a favor and watch it!",8
"
                There is something that I must admit before I get too far into praising this anime. I dropped it the first time I watched it. I wasn‚Äôt at all excited by the fact that the plot was moving slowly and the characters sat in a room and didn‚Äôt seem to do much of anything. After being asked to reconsider my thoughts and give Steins;Gate another look, something I rarely do unless someone has a really strong argument for my doing so, I find myself perplexed by the fact I dropped this show that molests your very soul with emotion and feeling, the kind of thing
                  that very few anime have the ability to do.
Let me start by addressing why I quit the first time and why I feel stupid for doing so. The slow pace of the first third of the series is actually really well done when you can look back and realize that it is not meant as much to progress the plot at a fast pace, but rather to show off the wide array of characters and get you invested in at least one or even two. Which does happen, believe it or not. Despite only ten episodes or so of this character building, there‚Äôs a certain humanity to every character that you rarely find in a single character in a longer anime. When the entire cast is like that, you know you‚Äôve reached something akin to god-like.
But that‚Äôs not to say the story is something to disregard, because it is also really good. Our main character, Rintaro Okabe, is an eighteen year old scientist who lives in a tiny apartment above an electronics store. He considers himself a mad scientist and has these little bouts where he talks to his cell phone about The Organization catching on to him and his lab. He‚Äôs not really mad, just seemingly bored with his life. He invents quite a few things with his trusty companion Daru, but it‚Äôs within the confines of a basic, uninteresting life. Soon enough, though, he winds up creating a time machine using a microwave. This is where all his troubles start and that boring life he had becomes a life of pain, suffering, and misery, but also a life of new friends and new loved ones.
The anime starts with Okabe taking his childhood friend, Mayuri Shiina, to a conference concerning the possibility of time travel. During this conference a strange object crashes into the roof and Okabe finds a young scientist, Makise Kurisu, lying dead in a storage room. From here, things go from bad to weird when he answers a mail and finds himself in a world where Makise is alive and well. On top of that, his texts to Daru had arrived a week early. This leads the members of Okabe‚Äôs Future Gadget Lab to believe that the creation that they have been working on, a modified microwave, is a time machine.  As they learn more about time travel, they find out that SERN, a European organization known for their particle accelerator, already created a time machine, but every experiment they did concerning a physical object turned said object into a gooey, gelatinous mass. They learn that in lieu of physical objects, they can send texts to the past to change the future.
With the help of Makise, Okabe winds up finding himself on a variety of world lines, essentially parallel timelines, with every text to the past he makes. With every new line, he seems to be the only person who can remember anything that happened in the previous lines. He eventually winds up in a world line where he decides to make his discovery of a time machine public. Before he can, though, SERN attacks and kills Mayuri, leading him into a continual cycle of going back in time to save her. It never works though. What he eventually learns from a time travelling girl named Suzuha Amane is that in the future, SERN controls everything in a sort of Orwellian dystopia. In order to save the world from that fate, he must return to the original timeline where Mayuri doesn‚Äôt die. To do that, he must undo every text that the members of the lab have sent, as well as his own.
Along the way, he discovers he has very deep feelings for Makise, and she for him, and this is all when he realizes that if he returns to the original world line, Mayuri will live, but Makise will die. Despite this, he returns to that line and learns from Suzuha, who has traveled back in time in her time machine, that he can save Makise from dying and prevent World War III by doing so. With that in mind, he proceeds to save Makise, save Mayuri, and save the world.
Talk about an epic plot. Last year, people spoke of episode nine of Puella Magi Madoka Magica as if it was something that couldn‚Äôt be beat. While that episode was good, if you liked that idea of going back to the past again and again to try and save the future, then you‚Äôll love Steins; Gate, because that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs about. It‚Äôs dramatic, it has far reaching consequences, and the plot may start slow, but never lets up after a certain point.
As I said previously, Steins;Gate is really as good as it is because of its cast of characters, more so than its plot. Okabe, our hero, is both hilarious and at times, a deeply involving character. While you don‚Äôt see it at first, he has a wide array of emotions aside from arrogant and cocky. He develops so nicely, and while that development isn‚Äôt the deepest of any character ever, it‚Äôs still fun to watch him accept his friends not as much as assistants and more so as family.
Makise Kurisu is one of the best tsundere characters to ever grace anime for a number of reasons. First of all, she isn‚Äôt annoying like many characters of her type. She is, in fact, a very smart girl who just has an awkward friendship with a guy who calls her his assistant and treats her like she‚Äôs in on his role plays. The fact of the matter is, despite how much arguing she does with Okabe, the bond that develops between the two is very heartfelt and meaningful. Despite the fact she forgets pretty much every major development that they have with every change in world line (minus the last world line), she still manages to move forward, rather than stay stoic. The fact that she broke Okabe out of his shell and made him show emotions toward another instead of seeming indifference made her just that much better. When she kisses Okabe, it tugs at the heartstrings. It‚Äôs a beautiful moment that isn‚Äôt destroyed by stupidity and never looked back upon as some sort of joke, but it becomes the emotional basis for the final episodes of the series. I, personally, find it to be one of the best relationships in an anime because of how much growth the two go through because of it, and the new Okabe that emerges that will do anything to save his love from dying.
The other real major character is Mayuri. I can‚Äôt say a lot about her, because I wasn‚Äôt emotionally invested in her. She was a good character to work off of Okabe and a fun character to watch help him develop, but the only real reason you‚Äôll probably love her is the fact that Okabe does. You see her die so many times and have to feel those same emotions that Okabe does. It comes as a major surprise that she dies, my jaw dropped when it happened. And dropped again and again. She‚Äôs the sweet, innocent girl who doesn‚Äôt deserve to die, but, as I said, it isn‚Äôt for that reason that you find yourself possibly shedding a manly tear over her, it‚Äôs the fact that Okabe is continually watching his life‚Äôs companion get killed.
Ruka is the last character I want to address in any sort of depth. I‚Äôm not a fan of cross-dressers, but he was pretty cute. And she was pretty cute. I was on the fence about his wanting to be a girl. It was a strange area to enter, made stranger by the fact that when he did become a she, Okabe raped her. Made stranger by the fact she‚Äôs in love with him. Maybe it‚Äôs because I was so invested in Okabe that I felt the way I did about he/she. Ruka is cute, but he‚Äôs a guy. The episode where Okabe has to go on a date with female Ruka is pretty hilarious, probably one of the funniest episodes of the series.
There are a ton of other characters, but none that are really of a lot of note. I was amazed by the sheer difference in the characters, all of them played off each other well and none were too alike. On top of that, the way they acted was just human enough that it was believable. The writing is so beautiful to be able to evoke emotions and create a world as believable as Steins;Gate‚Äôs.
And the cherry on top is the animation. It‚Äôs gorgeous and very distinct. Characters look fantastic and their eyes‚Äîmy God their eyes‚ÄîI could just swim in those big, beautiful globules forever. There is just something so mesmerizing about looking into Makise‚Äôs eyes, and I don‚Äôt know why, but I feel that it is one of the reasons you invest yourself in the characters. I don‚Äôt know where this came from, and I don‚Äôt have a particular reason to think that, but there has got to be something to those eyes‚Ä¶
Aside from the eyes, the backdrops are typically beautiful, and the only thing I disliked about the animation was the severe contrast of light and dark. I don‚Äôt know if this was meant to help convey emotion or not, but it really didn‚Äôt seem to. When it was sunny out, the screen was burning bright. When the characters were inside of the lab, it was really dark. There was no middle ground, and I did feel that there was a certain dullness to the colors, that while in no way detracting and more so a distinctive trait of the art style, was still sometimes a little hard to look at.
If you haven‚Äôt figured it out already, Steins;Gate is an amazing anime. Very rarely does something like this come along that takes you on such an emotional ride, invests you so much in characters that, while fictional, seem like they live and breathe in our world, and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout, wondering (sometimes slack-jawed, sometimes with a tear in your eye, sometimes with a warmness in your chest, sometimes with laughter rising in your throat) what will happen next. While I previously held Puella Magi Madoka Magica as the best anime of last year, I must kick it off its pedestal and place Steins;Gate where it rightfully belongs, not only as the top anime of 2011, but also one of the top anime of all time. Don‚Äôt be like me and quit because it‚Äôs a little slow, push through those first few episodes and be rewarded with one of the most emotionally satisfying experiences in anime history.",10

He made a laboratory where he tries to invent future gadgets. The way he speaks, the way he acts and even the way he thinks are all funny and interesting. It may sound retarded but it first makes u laugh and after that it makes u think. I think that Steins Gate is one of the best animes ever made. It has the best storyline ever made, if u want to watch Steins gate u have to be interested in it. If u want to
                  go even deeper after finishing all 24 episodes try watching it again. The parts that didnt make any sense in the beginning will suddenly become clear. I can only come to the conclusion that it was made to rewatch. If i didn't rewatch it I would never understand the beginning. Also the part about the  Phone Microwave is very interesting.Their test started with putting a banana in it and realizing it became a Gel-Banana after that they tried sending messages to the past. By just sending 1 message he can see the difference it made to their wordline. The way he panicked made me suffer from joy. The enjoyment is absolutely a 10.",10

                ""The universe has a beginning, but no end. ‚Äî Infinite. The stars, too, have a beginning, but their own power leads to their destruction. ‚Äî Finite. History dictates that it is the wise who are most foolish. One could call this a final warning from God to those who can still resist."" -Okabe Rintaro
Steins;Gate, what started off as a simple visual novel. Became a successfully became a stand out among anime, spawning a stand-alone movie as well as a visual novel follow up and adaptation for that.
""You, on the other side of the monitor, with the dumb expression!""- Okabe Rintaro
The story is a unique one,
                  I was originally turned away from watching it due to the Netflix description of it. However, when I took the time to sit down and watch it I was immediately encapsulated by it. This was primarily due to its unique take on time travel as a whole, taking what I thought would be some boring nonsensical time travel nonsense and threw it out the theoretical window. The story, though slow in the beginning episodes, slowly picks up traction as the stakes are dialed up to eleven. One aspect I have to praise it for is the reality of Okabe's struggle as he struggles to save the one closest to him and how in the end he must make a gut-wrenching sacrifice to set the world back on course.
""It's the choice of Steins Gate."" -Okabe's catchphrase.
The ending was a very good one, how it managed to tie everything up after the innumerable world line shifts and time leaps and how Okabe put his experiences to good use. Though the only problem I with Steins;Gate as a whole would be that the beginning episodes (2-8) even though they are necessary to set up all that comes afterward seem a bit bland in comparison to what comes afterward.
""Uhh... Hey mister, I am mad scientist. It's so COOOOL! Sonovabitch."" -Okabe Rintaro
A quick not on the Art Design. Although not my favorite, It didn't affect my enjoyment, except a few scenes throughout the whole thing that did affect my enjoyment negatively.
The highlight of Steins;Gates soundtrack, the song played during the opening 'Hacking to the Gate', the song itself (besides how amazing it sounds) contains much foreshadowing and from my perspective sounds like these are Okabe's own words. Another notable track would be the song 'Beleive me' a high emotive and suitable song for the scenes its used in. The rest of the soundtrack is pretty good and these two songs make up the shortcomings of all the others.
""I'm the great mad scientist, Hououin Kyoma!""
The characters in Steins;Gate, each of them is distinct from the last. You have the main (and best) character Okabe Rintaro, Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist and founder of the future gadget lab, he provides much entertainment even when he's being serious, he is the character who undergoes the most development across the 24 episodes, as you see slow descend in to madness after episode 12. In the end, he's at least happy, even if he is still haunted by the memories of the Alpha Attractor Feild. 
""Perverted Genius Girl!"" -Okabe to Kurisu. 
Makise Kurisu serves as Okabe's love interest and local Tsundere, you see through the series that she grows closer to Okabe and develops feelings, whenever Okabe attempts to give up he consoles Kurisu who serves as one of the driving forces for Okabe's continual efforts to put things right.
""I won't let you go. I won't let anyone take you. You're my hostage now. My guinea pig! There is no escaping me! Muhaha, muhahaha!"" -Okabe to Mayuri.
Shiina Mayuri, Okabe's childhood friend (and hostage) their friendship is shown right from the very start and as the series, some of the gaps are filled in on this hostage situation. Her character is a vital one and serves as an innocent bystander who loves cosplay
""Last is Lab Member 003: Hashida Itaru, the super hax0r""
""""Hacker"", not ""hax0r,"" n00b""- Daru's introduction
Hashida Itaru (Daru for simplicities sake) is the resident hacker at the future gadget laboratory. The most perverted member of out college misfits with a love for hentai, waifus and all things moe culture. You need a computer whiz to find this man on @channel and hit him up
""Because I'm from the goddamn future!"" -Okabe to Moeka.
Kiryuu Moeka serves as an antagonist. She is a quiet introverted girl who prefers to text rather than talk. Throughout she appears to bother Okabe quite a bit due to her behavior. Though by the end she becomes an employee at Mr. Brauns CRT shop thus removing her antagonist status
""This is Luka Urushibara. The 'son' of this shrine's chief priest. Yes, a son. No matter how you look at him, he looks like a lovely girl, but... he's a guy. ...His voice and behavior make him look like a female. Or more like, more feminine than a female. But he's a guy. Taller than Mayuri, yet oh so slender... But he's a guy. Looks stunning in shrine maiden clothing. But he's a guy. He's holding a broom, so I'm guessing that he was in the middle of cleaning. But he's a guy. It's so hot, even though it's almost evening. But he's a guy. Hell, cicadas won't shut up. But he's a guy.""-Okabe about Luka.
Luka Urushibara is a dude (despite what he looks and sounds like) sort of an apprentice to Okabe and who is more than willing to go along with his crazy antics. Over the series although something change, by the end you get to understand how Luka thinks and feels.
""In order to protect your important friends, they wouldn't tell the truth...or tell white lies. Being able to make friends like that...that is a very happy thing.""
Faris Nyannyan (real name: Rumiho Akiha) is the owner of the local maid cafe as well as an employee. She's a kind-hearted girl and is an active player in Okabe's mad scientist antics. Faris lost her father when she was a young girl though through the series we discover how her father met her maker and how she regrets those last word to him. Who doesn't love a maid cat (not me, I ain't into that stuff)
""This era is so peaceful. That's a wonderful thing... but it scared me. All I knew was the fight against SERN.""
Suzuha Amane, the part-time warrior is a young girl not from this time. Her role in the story is key as she helps the story reach where it is through her actions and exposition. Not much can be said for Suzuha, just a nice character to have around.
Overall I enjoyed the fuck out of this anime and would recommend this to anyone (especially those who love time travel)
""No one knows what the future holds, that's why its potential is infinite. Just like what this reunion demonstrated.""

                This is one of the best sci fi shows that I've ever seen. Its a mix of comedy, romance, and drama that never fails to surprise you. Every character is interesting and love-able. The plot twist are shocking and sometimes disturbing while making you eager to see what happens next. This show also sdes a good job of making empathize with the characters. I went from laughing out loud to sad to excited without it feeling like I was watching a different show. It's not many shows that can change its genre so quickly and still feel like one single whole. There are not enough
                  good things to say about this show. This show has all the reasons people love sci fi shows.",10
"
                I don't often rate anything a 10. I believe 10's are reserved for anime that have a really great story that keep you thinking about it for hours upon hours after just because its that thought-provoking.
I initially didn't understand why my friend recommended me this anime at first. She said it was cute. But I believe this anime does everything right. All the elements that make a great story, the plot, the art, the character, and the sound all create one of the most immersive series that I can remember. 
For me, the story becomes very serious and engrossing. This anime does that by throwing
                  constant plot developments that leave you hungering for more. I found the pacing really perfect. Some of the repetitive stuff toward of the middle of the anime was really tortuous but because the character himself was being tortured. And just when you couldn't take any more, the characters finally make some progress and either the mystery grows deeper or the stakes grow higher. I keep thinking it would've been so easy for the writer to keep repeating the same formula like Quantum Leap but I believe the plot was very well thought out, making you think about everything that happens from the beginning of the anime to the finish, with layers that you peel back. It is very clear to me the writer must've gone through the plot several times from different angles. 
Besides the deep multi-layered story, I also found the characters quite loveable and very easy to empathize. The characters have to make heart-wrenching decisions and the stakes are so high. I found myself ready to tear up because by the middle of the series, you learn more about the characters and their past. Perhaps this is because the main character is really such a protective guy. When you put yourself in the character's situation, you might ask yourself, ""would you change what you did in the past like they did?"" And you go through it with the characters with them.
Although in the beginning I enjoyed but was somewhat puzzled and almost getting tired of the constant crazy antics and mannerisms of the characters, by the end, I was sucked into what would happen to the characters and how the story would resolve. In the end, I found myself enjoying the anime because of the seriousness of the situations the characters found themselves in and not just the characters themselves.
Additionally the characters were all so lovable. The dynamics create such funny chemistry between the characters and you end up loving characters for their little quirks in personality and expressions or least at empathizing for the bad guys and girls. For the main lab characters, I found all their decisions at the end to leave me in awe and appreciation. I would envy knowing such wonderful characters as these in real life. And the anime and voice actors definitely bring them to life. 
I feel that this anime never dwells on anyone theme for too long, and constantly moves the story forward and revisits it later on. Everything has a consequence and I feel almost as if every second of the early episodes and later all were all so important to the entire story- not a second of that anime was wasted filler. Perhaps this was because the theme was on time travel but I definitely don't mind a deep anime such as this. With long shows like Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, having such depth in such a short series was very refreshing.
If you enjoyed the possibilities of Quantum Leap, combined with the consequences of the Butterfly Effect all wrapped in cute anime characters, I believe you'll definitely enjoy the ride this show gives you but done in grand anime moe style, with characters you'll learn to love or hate, and with laughs and heart-felt ""aw's"" along the way. So yes my friend was right, it was cute all the way up till the end. No other story medium can do that as well as anime and still be taken seriously.",10

                *Non-spoiler review*
This is the most amazing anime that I have ever watched, period. Well, it was good enough for me to use the main character of this series as my profile pic. xD
You might read a few reviews that talk about how the first few episodes are slow and what not, but personally I believe that the story was already quite intriguing since episode 1. There are a lot of unanswered questions at the start of the show that'll leave you theorizing, until the actual truth is dropped right on your face every single time. I have to admit that I was hooked right from
                  the get go, and I can promise you that it was worth the time.
Throughout the series there is a constant feeling that a lot is happening in the background, but first time viewers most likely won't be able to catch on thanks to the amazing misdirection this anime has. I wish I could forget the anime, then re-watch it once again, just to experience the chills that I felt every time a bomb dropped (figuratively of course).
The cast of characters suffer from lack of character development, for obvious reasons, but you'll end up loving them anyways. The only character that does receive development is our self-proclaimed mad scientist, and boy, does he receive a lot of development. I remember reading from somewhere that the best writers are the ones that put their characters through hell to bring out their true colors. Never has such a concept been more true than this anime.
While the animation quality, and a few of the sound effects and action scenes were a bit unpolished, I think it's still great overall. It's not a battle shounen so the action scenes aren't the focal point of the show anyways. Even so, the facial expressions are top notch. You can really feel the emotions going through the characters head, just by seeing their face. Another noticeable aesthetic is the severe white wash in many of the outside shots in the anime. I think it gives off an added sense of mystery, and it just goes to show you how much care the staff at White Fox invested into this anime.
In summary, this anime is going to take you along on an unforgettable journey. One that'll make you experience all kinds of indefinable emotions, yet not leave you confused and in the dark for long. Then, it'll part ways with you, leaving you with a satisfying conclusion to one of the most well-written anime of all time.
I don't have any more words to describe my experience watching this anime, so I'll leave it at that. Good luck to you, first-time viewer. El Psy Congroo.",10
"
                I could never understand why anyone would say the beginning is slow. From the opening scene of episode 1 to the final scene of episode 24 I was hooked on one of the most edge-of-your-seat stories ever told! Despite a few minor problems I have like inconsistent dialogue this is easily my favorite anime of all time; maybe even my favorite show of all time! The character dynamic between everyone in the show is next level and the characters in general are some of my favorites. Okabe Rintarou is on my very, very short lists of husbandos. And Mayuri is on my even shorter list
                  of waifus. Hououin Kyouma is another discussion though. All in all I find this an incredible piece of entertainment and a clinic on how to tell a great love story that is wrapped by an amazing time travel saga. 
Note: The organization won't allow me to go more in-depth as that would be on the ground of spoilers. If you are looking for something truly glorious then don't hesitate to begin one of the greatest shows of all time. May Steins;Gate swing open and accept you. El Psy Kongroo.",10
"
                I have to say this is by far the best anime if not even show overall about time travel. The story is really well thought through. It all makes perfect sense and best of all, it doesn't seem that unrealistic. That is a big factor for time traveling in movies and shows. Making it seem possible is huge and Steins gate makes it work. A must watch even If you aren't a fan of anime!
The character development is outstanding and again represents a realistic situation pretty well.
It is pretty clear why I give the story 10/10.
Art is great but just isn't my cup of tea.
                  It's kind of old school but don't let that disturb you that is just my opinion. I'm not saying it is bad just that it isn't my favorite style. Even if you are the same everything else compensates and I would overall give the anime a score of higher than 10!",10
"
                Steins;gate was an anime that I thought id never like, as I've seen dozens of time travel series and their inabilities to produce a logical or understandable plot and science. Steins gate however managed to completely incinerate that expectation within me, I could honestly never ask for a better time travel show.
Story 9.9/10
We all know that handling time travel can be pretty complicated, it has more holes than plugs, so it's fair to say that having a bit of issues with how the logic was being presented and explained can be somewhat tolerable. 
Steins;gate's a story about a chuunibyou young man, named Okabe Rintarou who
                  messed with the structure and rules of time. Unexpectedly obtaining a device capable of manipulating time, his desire to become a renowned scientist or a true mad scientist if you wanna call it, drove him into developing the time machine further which eventually led to a disastrous set of events that he's basically receiving as a punishment for toying with time. 
Like i said before, time travel is a heavy theme for a story, thus you would really need a consistent, not difficult to understand system that can drive the story forward while covering the thousands of issues time travel stories inevitably have. I wouldn't have rated this show a 10/10 if it hadn't handled it this smoothly. Steins;gate uses a system called a world-line which In my opinion, the perfect way to present the story, it explained things that would normally be confusing and too complex to comprehend. I'm not gonna go into details on explaining it, I'm pretty sure you've already gotten an idea on what it is and it's concept if you've watched the anime till the end. So yeah, as I was saying, this theme has plenty of flaws, but fortunately, steins gate managed to avoid as much of it as possible, sure there are some holes here and there but they're not so much of a bother to the story that you can easily overlook them. All in all the story is intense, engaging and makes you constantly wondering what'll happen next, and that's great.
Art: 8/10
It's not the best, but it's definitely a good quality for this type of show. The world of steins;gate has this really distinct feeling to it, I'm not sure how to describe it but whatever the description may be it definitely fits the theme perfectly. Animation wise, id say it's very nice, I don't really care about the art or animation, as I enjoyed to story so much that it didn't bother me on how the anime was visually presented. 
Sound: 9.5/10
OP = banger, downloaded the full version of hacking to the gate instantly upon finishing episode 24. 
ED: Could be better, but I'm content with what I got
Voice = Outstanding, the voice acting of them seiyuus were really top notch, perfect voice actors for each character.
OSTs: Awesome, they could've added more though.
Character: 10/10
I just can't express this one enough, every characters were nicely fleshed out, well developed and has a different purpose/contribution to the story. Main character Okarin was already pretty likeable from the very first episode, he's hilarious, goofy and sort of complex, I can see why many would put him as favorites. But to me, the best thing that this show has offered was kurisu, like fuck man, her tsundere was just too cute and delightful to watch. I was seriously saying ""no... no... no..."" Under my breath when (spoilers) Kurisu said something along the lines of: ""you'd be returning to the world line where I was stabbed"", I cared so much for the characters in this anime that if it were to mess up in someway, It'd probably bother me for days. Luckily the story ended beautifully and I couldn't ask for a better one. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
Took me one day to finish it, you just couldn't stop pressing the ""next episode"" button after each episode ended.
Overall 10/10
Looking back I haven't had many anime that ended with me saying ""holy shit what a ride"", steins gate was among the first to make me do, it absolutely filled my uneventful day with plenty of emotions, one day I'll come back to this series for a rewatch, cause once I've forgotten what most of the content here is all about, I'm definitely gonna have a good time experiencing steins gate all over again.
S;g 0 was meh, I prefer to consider that a fanfiction rather than an alternative or a midquel.",10
"
                Let me start by saying that I don't write reviews. I rate the anime I've seen and have had many favorites, but have never been compelled to write a review (probably because I'm lazy lol). But after finishing Steins;Gate I was instantly compelled to write a review. I was up the entire night thinking about it.
I LOVED THIS SHOW!
It instantly became my favorite show and I've seen shows that I thought nothing would top. This show topped all of them for me. And to think I almost dropped it because it started too slow. 
DO NOT LET THE SLOW BEGINNING FOOL YOU! 
It does take
                  some time to get really into this show (about 8-10 episodes), but it is completely worth it and you'll look back and appreciate those beginning episodes. And once you get to episode 12 good luck having a social life until you complete the series. You will not be able to stop watching once you reach this point.
This anime evoked emotions in me I never thought any show could (except GOT). It made me laugh, it made me happy, it made me angry and it even made me cry and I DO NOT CRY....EVER (except once in Naruto Shippuden... if you've seen it, you probably know which part lol) and that's saying something. I've been recommending this show to people who don't even watch anime. An anime has never made me feel the way this one did. I stared at a wall for an hour when it ended. And I'll probably watch this show a thousand more times and still feel the exact same way I did when I first watched it.
This is truly a beautiful show and even though I'm really sad it wasn't longer and I wish it could be a never-ending show with hundreds of episodes, it's a perfect masterpiece and any changes would have probably messed up that perfection. So for those that hate long reviews and just skim through to the end (which I usually do) I'll just say...
PLEASE WATCH THIS SHOW!!! IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!! :D lol",10
"
                This show is as close to perfection as I‚Äôve ever seen an anime get. When I finished, it left me feeling somewhat empty for weeks, and I couldn‚Äôt watch another show seriously for a month afterwards. This is probably my favorite work of fiction ever. I‚Äôll go through each category individually. Unlike many other shows, there is no genre that really describes Steins;Gate. At times, it feels like a slice of life show. At other times, it‚Äôs a full on psychological thriller. The show has loads of comedy, and a great romantic sub-plot. It really is everything rolled into one, in the best way possible.
First,
                  the story. Unlike most other stories about time travel, this show is about the act of time travel itself. To most shows that deal in time travel, time travel is merely a plot device, something to make the story possible. In these kinds of shows, you notice that time travel is only used to actually get the characters to the setting of the story, while the story is often unrelated to the act of time travel itself. In Steins;Gate, on the other hand, the act of time travel is the focus of the story. The story deals directly on the act of time travel, and a lot of the consequences time travel gives rise to. The show makes time travel make sense, if you pay attention. It doesn‚Äôt leave huge plot holes like you would expect from something like this, and by the end, the story really does make sense. This is part of the reason why this show has such great rewatch value. 
The art for this show is pretty, but nothing spectacular. On a scale where 1 is early DBZ/One Piece and 10 is the Fate series, I‚Äôd give it an 8. The characters look great, and everything looks slightly faded. The colors aren‚Äôt vibrant, but this often contributes to the tone of the series. Light in general is extremely bright in this show, but in a faded sort of way. It‚Äôs hard to describe, so just watch the first episode.
The soundtrack for the show is incredible. The voice actors for both the dub and the sub are amazing, and the music is perfect as well. The opening and ending are both great. Background music features a lot of piano, which fits the more emotional moments really well. The music always, always captures the tone perfectly, from fun and lighthearted, to dramatic, to emotional, to uplifting and inspiring. This is another thing you really need to experience to understand, so I‚Äôll leave it at that.
Finally, the characters. This is where the show really shines, in its characters. Every single character in the main cast is 9/10 or above, and out of my top 5 characters ever, 3 of them come from Steins;Gate. This show nails character interactions better than I thought was possible. Conversations can be hilarious without being goofy. From casual conversation to the most impactful exchanges, this show does it right. The interactions in this show get emotional quick, and I would say it‚Äôs the single biggest factor in what makes this my favorite show. Conversation and music together always get you to feel exactly what the writers wanted you to feel. Lastly, every major character in this show is relatable. You understand what they are going through at all times, and you can really feel for them.
If I could only ever recommend one anime to anyone, it would be this. If I could forget one show in order to experience it again, it would be this. If my kidnapper asked for an anime recommendation, and said they would torture and kill me if they didn‚Äôt like it, this would be the show I gave them. Please, watch this show.",10
"
                I have no idea where to start with this. I love Steins;Gate, it is one of my favorite animes. I honestly couldn't care less about the adventures that happen in time travel, its probably why I am not a fan of Doctor Who and have no intention of starting. I do, however, want to know the story behind time travel itself, how is it done? what is it? what happens? Steins;Gate delivers with a theory that is believable and a story that goes along with it. 
As I said, I don't care about the adventure of time travel, but I know it can effect the
                  future in a monumental way that would most likely be bad. This anime drives home the fact that the past is your own, it makes you who you are today, and, for better or worse, it was the best thing for you.
I recommend Steins;Gate for it's dark exploration into time travel, well developed characters (and the lovable Makise Kurisu), and lessons learned along the way!",10
"
                When I first watched Steins;Gate, I thought it was super boring. The main character Okabe Rintarou was quite stupid. I just treated it as a common harem animation. Thus, after finishing the first episode, I dropped it. 
However, after that, I found that in the most of the anime ranking list Steins;Gate was on the top. This really amazed me. How can a ""normal harem animation"" gain such great honor? With curiosity, I continued to watch this animation. Then, I found the reasons why almost everyone speaks highly of it. 
Actually, episodes 1 to 11 is just a warm-up for the latter part. If you
                  can keep watching, then the story after episode 12 will greatly amaze you. I spent around 20 days to finish the first 11 episodes but finished the following 13 ones within a day.That kind of amazement is just like a confirmed atheist seeing Jesus relived with his own eyes. I have watched many animations with good plots, but I have to say that the story of Stein;Gate can be one of the best among them. I am moved that in such a fast-paced society, the designers of Steins;Gate are willing to use 11 episodes as a warm-up. They really deserve my admiration. 
The art of this animation is perfect. The dark color is a fantastic indication of the following conflicts. However, I think that if Whit Fox can make this anime with the same art style of Re:0, the art part of Steins;Gate would be even better. Also, I believe that in this way, the sales of its BD would be tripled. 
Thanks for this animation. Though up to now, I have watched it for over 5 times, every time I start to watch it again would offer me great enjoyment. In my mind, Steins;Gate is indeed a masterpiece.",10
"
                Seeing Steins Gate on this list ranked number 2 I figured I must watch this anime. According to everyone its a masterpiece in the same league as FMA Brotherhood. So i came in with high expectations, and I would say they where met, just not in the way I was expecting. The twists were not particularly crazy and the plot wasn't all that amazing. As I started to watch the first couple of episodes I began to wonder what all the hype was about. Though I grew to love the cast of unique characters, who seem to defy anime tropes. Unconventional love story and maybe
                  my new favorite couple in anime, mixed with strong weird friendships. This group felt more real than almost any other characters in anime. Not only are the characters great but the use of time travel in Steins Gate is interesting and just different enough that it felt fresh. The ending without spoiling it, was sweet but also not perfect and not a happily ever after. I love Steins Gate because it was grounded in reality and centered on real relationships between a group of friends who discover time travel and the consequences of altering the past. Lovable realistic characters make this anime one of the best in awhile. Don't miss Steins Gate.",9
"
                Steins gate is one of those anime's which you find and they simply blow you away. I stumbled across this show and decided i would watch it not expecting much and at the start i was intrigued but it wasn't the most exiting thing. Throughout the episodes i began o really enjoy the characters and the simple things they got up too. But as the story progressed and things became more complicated i found out interesting and amazing this show really was with one simple twist the show really got me and i was hooked form then on i really loved it. 
This show is
                  one of my favourite anime's now because it was just right with how different how funny how interesting and how entertaining and anime can truly be.",10
"
                STEINS GATE IS NOT GOOD!!!!!
Yes it is not a good anime
Steins gate is a fantastic anime, it should be the standard of how a story should be done.
Story 10: You have no idea what's to come. This show may seem like a simple slice of life show at first, but when it hits the fan, it gets everywhere. Once it gets going it does not stop.Art 10:  art is gorgeous and simple. Character designs make each character distinct.
Characters 10: BRUH... BRUH OKABE!!!! BRUH... EVERYONE!!!
Enjoyment 10: I had an amazing time watching steins gate, if I could change one this. I only wish I could use the time machine to travel back and watch it for the first time again.

                Steins;Gate is breathtaking. The dialogue is superb, the time-traveling is fascinating, and the character development is nonpareil. I dived into this show expecting an eerie experience ‚Äì the kind of experience that warps your sense of temporal continuity. But soon I was realized that was only the tip of the iceberg. I was completely caught off guard by the brilliant dialogue ‚ÄìI highly recommend it to anim√© fans. This show revels in hilarious meta-commentary, appealing to those familiar with the anim√© world. Furthermore, the character development is organic, funny, and interesting. Thus, by the time its main plot and drama emerged, I was fully immersed
                  in the characters. 
After finishing this show in one day, I am certain it was designed to be binge-watched. Its plot is so gripping and the story is laid out in such a way that you never feel the incentive to hit apple Q or alt F4; plus, it's only 24 episodes. If any of you have a few days to spare, or if any of you feel that dire need to be distracted from the mundanity of quotidian life, dive in. You won't regret it.",9

                I started watching this anime because I have heard some good things about it, and I decided to give it a try. It is a show surrounding time-travel, and follows a group of individuals who start working on it as a type of project, but later on learn about it's consequences. During the first several episodes, it was a bit slow. Pretty funny with a lot of sci-fi references, but there wasn't much real action. After a little bit, though, the action really picked up and it became very dramatic. The art wasn't something to write home about, but it wasn't bad either. Character designs
                  were unique enough, and complemented their personalities well. The sound was pretty good. Personally I watched the dub, and only one episode of the sub, and the voice acting in the dubbing was better in my opinion. The theme song was quite good, and I liked other sounds within the anime as well. The character development in my opinion was outstanding. All of the characters were very unique, and had depth to their personalities. Every person has back-stories that you come to learn later on in the anime, and the portrayal of them was quite amazing. Near the end there were some confusing parts that didn't make much sense to me, but overall most things made sense. Overall, this was not my favorite anime, but I enjoyed it very well. I recommend it to anybody who likes deep, almost dark anime, with characters that make you feel for them, almost like you know them personally. I could almost compare it to a supernatural anime, even though it's solely based on science. Overall, 9/10.",9
"
                For those who haven't know about Steins;Gate, I'm writing this review to show you some of my thoughts and my impression about this great, even almost perfect anime. To know, I am rating the ANIME, not the visual novel but some rates are based on comparison to the visual novel.
To those who doesn't know a damn thing about Steins;Gate, a short preview about this anime is that it is an anime focused on a time machine and it is science-fiction. I will give no more than that. It aired around the same time as Madoka so it is not a mainstream anime. I will say
                  this, as a non-mainstream anime, you will want to watch it again and again. Let's start with the review then. Starting with the story.
I give 10/10 for the story. If I can, I should give 11/10. Like I said,it is a time machine focused anime but that's just it from me. I will emphasize on the science-fiction part. It is a visual novel based anime from the same name. The original was created from 5pb and the visual novel is also the second visual novel of a science-fiction adventure genre. The anime also follows the same genre. However,one thing that's great about this anime is the science-fiction proportion. While most science-fiction anime consist of more fiction than science, this anime to me is 99% science and 1% fiction. Do not worry, within the anime, they explain every theory in a very simple way for their viewer so that they can enjoy the anime and the theory used regarding a time machine as well. Another great thing are that they leave very small, insignificant loopholes at the ending; they start the anime interestingly, they give climaxes to subplots, they wrap things in an unexpected way for the main plot and many more. If any downside to the anime part, is that it is not really detailed like the visual novel, but this may due to budget limitation, since their producer, White Fox, is a new studio.
For art, I give 9/10. To judge the art part is basically a subjective rating. However, the reason I can give 9 because of the improvements over the visual novel. Many, I believe, people don't play the visual novel due to the art done by huke, the artist that creates Black Rock Shooter. This changes in the anime. The basic art, like the character's face, background, etc is still the same. The only difference is that how White Fox brings it. Subjectively, I would rate it 10/10 but some people would rather not due to the insignificant loopholes but I still say 9 because the visual novel itself does have them and I think, it would be bias for a visual novel based anime to erase those loopholes itself because those loopholes exist from the visual novel, not the anime.
For the sound, 10/10. All seiyuu in the anime are also the seiyuu from the visual novel. Mamoru Miyano plays the protagonist and let me say this, it really gives the protagonist the comedic and serious vibe whenever needed. For other seiyuus, I will not review them because due to the no spoilers rule. For the OP and ED, they only uses one each, except on special episodes. The OP is 'Hacking to The Gate'. It is an amazing OP for me. The background is ordinary however the song itself is great. The ED is 'Toki Tsukasadoru J≈´ni no Meiyaku'. It is not as great as the OP but it's good enough. 
Characters, 10/10. The protagonist is Okabe Rintarou, an 18 years old chuunibyou. With just those characteristics, I can say that he is a very comedic guy. However, there is a very serious side of him as well and that's what also really makes it an interesting anime as well. The other male MC is Hashida 'Daru' Itaru, an otaku, pervert and a hacker. He is 18 years old, a friend of Okabe. Some twist about him will be very awesome later in the anime. The first female MC is Shiina Mayuri. She is 16 years old, Okabe's childhood friend, a very childish character yet can be mature at some times although the childish part plays most of it. Visual novel says that she is an airhead but I didn't see it in the anime. She is a very important character because she gives the story the biggest twist. The second female MC is Makise Kurisu. She is 18 years old. A science genius, the brain of the anime and most importantly, tsundere. She is as important as Mayuri, in different terms of course. Important characters are there as well but I will just say their names. The names are : Amane Suzuha, Kiryuu Moeka, Urushibara Ruka, Faris NyanNyan, Tennouji Yuugo and Tennouji Nae. 
Enjoyment are 10/10. This is based in first impression and rewatch value. My first impression of this anime was fantastic. I did not see any review before watching this anime and I think I'm lucky because I was afraid of any spoilers exist within the reviews. That's why I'm writing this review to those who haven't watch Steins;Gate. After I watched it for the first time, I have watched it again and again and again until about 7 times and I am still awed by the anime. Right now, I still watch the anime. I believe there is no greater anime regarding time machine that will beat this one in decades. Simply, because there is too many greatness in the anime. My regret is if only this anime could've been expanded into 2 seasons, which I think, possible. However, it might gives a different vibe so 1 season, 24 episode anime is the best choice. Many anime like Naruto, Bleach and One Piece are filled with fillers and it lowers the rate of the anime. Fortunately, this one doesn't. Also, as episode flies reaching the ending, the vibe increases, although they decreased a bit at some points. However, at the end, they will be at  the peak of the peak of enjoyment.
Overall, this anime is 10/10. This anime excels in every aspects and I believe every minor loopholes are accepted because of the greatness that covers it and the fact that loopholes exist in every anime. For those who have watched Steins;Gate, please try your best to review it spoilers-free for those who haven't watched them. And for those who haven't watched Steins;Gate, do not waste your time checking what anime should you watch next. Give your time to Steins;Gate's 1st episode. I give you my word, the 1st episode is a big and great starter for the anime. Once you have watched it, you are hooked and you expect more of them or even greater than them. Do not worry, you will be pleased.",10
"
                Okay so lets start this by saying that initially you guys might not get into it because of the slow start but personally I find it makes the anime more enjoyable to watch. I went into this anime just because it looked interesting and I some what found the animation for this interesting, I personally like the animation colors to be darker. Now the story was damn good it pulls you in and by that I mean you will probably sit and watch for a couple episodes or more in one sitting now I finished this in one sitting. The characters I found were very
                  interesting if I do say so myself they were all diverse and the depth for the main characters was good. Now having said all that I got to admit that the 5pb I think is the writer or creators of this are a really good company I have seen all their works Robotic;Notes, Chaos;Head, and I am currently watching Occultic;Nine which is shaping up to be a good one highly recommend Steins;Gate and their other works you won't regret it.",10
"
                This anime, god dammit this anime. First of all, I do not recommend watching this if you have a short attention span or have difficulty when concentrating because things that you probably didn't even think were important in the early episodes end up playing a very important role in the future. Also, the only reason why I put an 8 and not a 10 or a 9 for 'Enjoyment' was because of the emotion that hits you in the face (like a truck) half way through. 
I will admit though, it was a bit of a slow burner in the begging but did not disappoint.
                  The characters are defined and the backstories are so subtle yet emotional, the concept in general was concluded with zero loose ends and the art is quite unique, I have come to find. 
Although there are only intros on particular episodes (why I don't really know), they were still amazing; in fact the entire soundtrack is highly commendable.
A rather rushed review and not really organised but to conclude, this anime is simply amazing and has certainly found a permanent place in my top favorites.",10

                Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
Steins;Gate
Because it's full of holes.
Yes, it was very enjoyable. And yes, it's much better and smarter and more sophisticated than a lot of anime out there.
But it could have been even better.Steins;Gate didn't live up to it's potential. What it gave us is only a fraction of what I think it should have. Why do I say this?
Well, for an audience that doesn't watch much sci-fi, this is an amazing anime. I'd highly recommend it to anybody that isn't really into science-fiction as a taster.
But if you watch or read sci-fi; or if you even have a basic high-school knowledge of Physics, you'll be picking out holes in this series every episode. The number of paradoxes created, and the amount of stupid crap spouted by some of these characters was enough to ruin the show for me. (CERN? Seriously? Dystopian future world controlled by CERN? Do they know anything about the scientific world whatsoever?)
The series starts slow, but it operates and moves at a good pace. The main character Okabe Rintarou, is ear-grindingly annoying at first, coming across as incredibly forced fan bait. 
But eventually things start to pick up, and it's during the final quarter of the anime that it really begins to shine. The soundtrack is amazing, the characters are deep and structured and layered, and anime will have you feeling fulfilled and whole by the twenty-fourth episode.
It's a shame that it couldn't reach it's potential. But what we got wasn't bad at all.

                Trippy Time Travel anime? Sign me up!
Kind of embarrassed to say I didn't watch this anime when it was the hype but I can see why it was a hype way back when I was in middle school? I don't even remember. So there are plenty of stuff about time travel, the biggest right now being Dr. Who (which I don't watch but a lot of my friends do), and I think the anime accurately describes the consequences of time travel. Obviously there's a lot of made up stuff/ theoretical but hasn't been proven stuff about time travel, but it was convincing to watch as
                  a part of the story. Science buffs might disagree with me though.
It's not everyday you see an anime as well-written as this one. The way the characters were written and the way they showed their emotions was somewhat connectable but at the same time ridiculous since Okabe Rintarou and his gang aren't exactly the norm. However, I thought the way the friends interacted with each other was pretty accurate as to how we, or I at the least, interact with my close group of buddies, even if I'm not building a time machine. 
Okabe Rintarou as a character is also pretty appealing as a protagonist. He's flashy and crazy and somewhat delusional, but also true to heart and dedicated. I mean come one, how many crazy (but also not very crazy) virgin scientist main characters are there? He's an interesting guy that provides comic relief to the more serious sides of the story but also get's you rooting for the happy end. 
Redeeming qualities of the show? The well-written story and Okabe Rintarou. If you follow voice actors like I do, you might get a bit tripped up because all you hear is Tamaki Suoh's voice during the crazy times and Light Yagami's voice during the serious times, but it definitely shows Mamoru Miyano is a talented guy. I'd definitely recommend this to the people who like Sci-Fi and realistic anime better than say, fantasy? It might get a little hard to understand and confusing at times, but it'd definitely worth the watch!",8
"
                Note: I'm writing this review after having both watched and rewatched and I can tell you that it's almost better the second time around.
Okay, now for the review.
Steins;Gate follows an eccentric college student named Okabe Rintarou (yes, yes, it's the other way around in English but I'm too used to thinking of his name like this), a self-proclaimed mad scientist who works to bring chaos to the world. He lives in Akihabara with friend and fellow inventor Hashida Itaru, as well as childhood friend Mayuri Shiina. The three occupy the Future Gadget Lab, a place for building all kinds of contraptions.
The show begins as a
                  very slice-of-life type anime, aside from the occasional foreshadowing (of which there is PLENTY), but after about a third of the way through the series, it darkens and becomes the time-travel thriller we all know and love. The plot of the show goes in such a way that you never have the chance to expect when you get hit with feels next, and when you do get hit, you have to keep up with the pace so as to not get left behind. 
Story: 10/10
I basically explained why the story is incredible, in that the creators managed to craft such an intricate storyline almost perfectly. The ending is also something to watch out for. As many would guess, the ending to a good show can make or break the final opinions, and this show did not fail at all. Wonderful job!
Art: 9/10
The artwork is not typical moe anime, but more realistic (for an animation, that is). Very subdued colors, but very lifelike, which helps to bring out the characters more.
Sound: 9/10
I didn't notice the sound much in the first go-around, but during the rewatch I picked up on how they worked with subtle, errie sounds to aid in the vibe for the first half, then picked it up dramatically for the follow-through. 
Character: 10?10
Just like the story, I feel this was done incredibly. Every single character had not just a backstory, but a good, well thought-out one. This is quite hard to come by nowadays, even for the best of animes. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
There's a reason why this is one of my few 10/10's on my list. There wasn't a single moment where I thought about skipping forward, both for fear of missing out and fear I was doing a disservice to the storyline. This is a story that deserves its time in the limelight, and with Steins;Gate 0 coming out soon, I'm sure it will get even more recognition.
Overall: 10/10
When I finish a show and I think it should get a 10, I typically give it a 9 or even an 8. It's only with the few shows that make me actually stop and just sit there for a few minutes after its over, wondering what's gonna happen now that I have seen this show. This is one of the few shows that have done that for me. 
It was a great ride, and I'm sure I'll be rewatching it again very soon!",10
"
                Disclaimer here, I am no means a critic, right now it's actually pretty hard to figure out my thoughts here so bare with me here. 
This. This right here is my favorite anime of all time. I have watched this anime about 3-4 times and I have wondered if I was just being based or not but I just love it to death. For some context here, if you're reading my review and haven't decided to watch it then please do, I don't want to ruin the moments in this anime so yes, watch it. 
STORY  -----------
Here we go - When I first watched
                  this anime, I thought the first 12 episodes were a little slow, but over time I found out why. The first 12 is just you getting to know the cast, classic world building and for me anyway it worked. The main point where Mayuri getting shot is so expertly done to where it wasn't out of nowhere but very subtle.  To prove my claim it would be SERN. We the audience know how powerful SERN is and how they will control the time travel market going forward so it's no surprise that they are behind it. The magic is that Okabe knows this, he gets texts telling him how he's being watched and even gets a picture of a severed doll's head. It's beyond creepy and that's the point why Okabe would not want to go public with the Time Leap machine. I know that in this point of the anime us, the people watching would wish that Okabe should use the time leap machine and see what happens.  And the story throws you on your head and kills Mayuri, a huge loss to the plot and development. We have spent the entire 12 episodes focusing on the characters. Mayuri's death shows the that the time leap machine actually works. We're glad to see Okabe using it but at what cost?
Time and time and time again Okabe tries to save Mayuri to no avail. The thing that I love about this series is that Okabe is just such a great main character. Liked from the beginning of the show to the end. He feels real about the choices he makes and he makes as much mistakes as we do. Now yeah this review is pretty jumbled but I'm thinking out loud here. 
Oh have I even mentioned the writing of this show? No? Don't even get me started here. (Yes I know it's based off the Visual Novel) Prove me wrong but every single plot point is proven and woven into the story so seamlessly. Stuff you see from episode 1 seems so insignificant like how Kurisu tells Okabe that he tried to talk to before than you see it in episode 23 and IT ALL MAKES SENSE! I fucking love this series so much. You learn so much and when it comes altogether, it creates this masterpiece. When Okabe and Kurisu kiss for the first time Okabe tells Kurisu that it's not his first kiss, well this is pretty common but when shown the movie, IT'S ACTUALLY KURISU WHO KISSES HIM IN THE PAST. My god that is so cool. Hopefully you can see my point now.  This story is something special that really changed me after I watched it. (OmG ThIs ChAnGeD mY LifE) Throughout your time with this show, you're shown that time travel is something not to be messed with. A simple line of text can change events that you don't even know existed. This would be even more so in Steins;Gate 0 but this is about Steins;Gate. A single Upa causes WWIII to happen or not. This single thing that Mayuri drops sparks something so bad man. Throughout Steins;Gate Okabe loses the IBM and he needs to get it back, and to get it back, it's time to retrace your steps by undoing each D-Mail to do so. The fact that each time that this anime goes, it goes back and forth. Kurisu was supposed to die but since Okabe sent a text message to Daru he accidentally created the first D-Mail and what do you think that means, he needs the IBM so the lab raid doesn't happen but doing so saves Mayuri but kills Kurisu again. They brought back this plot point from Episode 1 mind you and brings it up again. This is so awesome. His moral dilemma really hit hard. When he chooses to sacrifice Kurisu and save Mayuri It really made me cry so hard. I'll get to the characters in a minute but yeah. I haven't cried so hard in an anime for a while. I would  only do this if it truly grasped me and sucked me into this world. I wouldn't really say that a sucker for 10s, a fact for this would be giving Your Name a 7. When I give something a 10, it sold me. It made me feel something. I can surely say that this did just that.
CHARACTERS -----------
Makise Kurisu is the star of the show for me here. A first look at here would be the typical Tsundere but a little less and just mean sometimes. Yeah this was the case for the first couple of episodes but this anime ain't like this. Each time Okabe would just call her Christina just because he couldn't even pronounce her name right is hilarious. The continue banter between these two is pure gold every time they are on screen. Over the course of the series they become really good friends but the type where they would be mean in public then nice behind their backs. It's all the more better when Okabe needs her help to save Mayuri. He isn't behind his Hououin Kyouma Persona but he desperately needs her help. It throws you for a loop. You even find out he developed this persona for Mayuri and in the movie, it tells you that Makise is the ONE WHO GAVE HIM THE IDEA. Again this series is so good. Now back to Makise, behind her demeaner she will show a little more about herself and we find out about her relationship with her dad and how severe it's gotten. Okabe agrees to help her, if this were the Okabe from episode 5 or so he probably wouldn't care that much. And when he calls her a precious friend it's even more impactful. When people talk about their feelings to such a degree it's just beautiful. 
For the little lines for every other character then here's some for Mayuri. Mayuri is a breath of fresh air for this series. She is so wholesome and the only one who knows what is actually going on. Mayuri isn't as smart as everyone else but she knows what is precious and holds on to that. She is the driving force for Okabe and Okabe is her driving force also. She saves him as many times as he has tried to save her. 
Daru doesn't get a lot of development and that's reserved for 0. But he does get some as  in Suzuha. His future daughter. And he the one who actually built the time machine to send her. He's the typical fat otaku who loves his 2D girls. He is the comic relief as he says comments towards Kurisu and Makise, and I got to admit, he is funny sometimes. The ""Super Hacker"".
Most of the minor characters such as Luka or anime onlys ""Ruka"", Suzuha (I don't really consider her minor but I don't care), Moeka and Faris.
I got to say Faris did get some development in this series to, the dynamic between her and her dad was something special. The whole cause of the D-Mail was to save her dad, and this was noble, kind of sad actually. 
ART -----------
The art was basic, nothing outstanding but it had some really good moments as when Okabe got the text and thought something might of happened to Mayuri, the whole black and white was stunning.
This series doesn't need that good animation but I would say that it's really good. Nothing insane but nothing bad either. 
SOUND -----------
Holy shit is every song in the anime and the LN so good? The Op and End are unskippable and every song in the background and in the OST in general is top notch. 
Yeah I really really enjoyed this anime. It brought me tears, laughter and memories. That was pretty deep huh
10/10",10
"
                So, I noticed that this anime recently moved from the #3 spot to the #2 spot on MAL. For real? This anime was recommended as ""doing time travel way better"" than Future Diary, which I thought was pretty awesome, but despite being more ""serious"", I find Stein's Gate pales in almost every element. The premise is certainly a good one and the beginning seems to hold a lot of promise but I'm not sure where ""the second half is a masterpiece"" comes from. 
Art: okay, to me most of the characters looked sorta flat faced. Apparently their production budget was low. No particular attraction or
                  detraction. Whats with the hair clip when Ruka is a guy?!? Thought they should have at least tried to make his gender matter a bit more rather than just used as a plot device.
Sound: again, okay, no particular attraction or detraction. Probably could be better used for emotional tension in the more dramatic moments. OP theme is quite good.
Story: slow to start off with, then when it's meant to become a masterpiece halfway, often contrived, full of pseudoscience, ""no loopholes"" because the viewer is so confused as to whats going on and many loose ends which don't get explained/tied up. Like, what was with the gelnanas? How did everyone remember bits of their other world lines? Mostly predictable, though still imminently watchable.
Characters: found it hard to connect with them or feel their chemistry. Okarin is selfish as anything, asking everybody to give up their own wishes to fulfil his own. And being the protagonist, obviously immune to death himself, which I found particularly annoying at the end, despite it the final episodes giving the whole series a sort of closure and resolution. Kurisu is a very attractive character. Hardly felt the chemistry though, except for THAT episode, which is particularly touching. Would have worked as a beautiful ending. I thought Daru was a great character, shouldve been better developed, especially his relationship with Okarin.likewise moeka. Everybody else was like ""who cares"" or ""why are they even in this story again?"" There was one particular line Ruka has in his episode which I thought said a lot about sexuality in Japanese culture though which I found fairly touching. His one shining moment.
So yeah, enjoyable and watchable enough. But I didn't find it particularly moving. Too many flaws. Ultimately a forgettable anime for me.",7

                ''The universe has a beginning, but no end. ‚Äî Infinity. Stars, too, have their own beginnings, but their own power results in their destruction. ‚Äî Finite. It is those who possess wisdom who are the greatest fools. History has shown us this. You could say that this is the final warning from God to those who resist.'' - Okabe Rintarou.
There is no other word to describe this anime: perfection. It is the masterpiece of Sci-Fi that tackles time travel simply and accurately. Even so, it also encompasses other genres such as suspense, romance, drama and comedy (very good by the way).
Initially, it is basically the
                  story of a young ""mad scientist"" who, together with his group of lab members, accidentally create a time machine at the same time as they  discover a conspiracy involving time travel by a super secret company.
The development of the characters is the key point. All of them are perfectly well developed, and so the suspense revolves around each one of them. Besides the fact that the protagonist is super charismatic with an extravagant personality, being responsible for the best moments of the anime. It is worth mentioning that initially, the first half of the anime focuses on character development and experiments with the time machine, which is not a mistake. This development is precisely essential for the elaboration of suspense and the shocking climax. Suddenly it becomes an emotional rollecoaster.The suspense is so good that it goes so far as to explode your mind (and the mind of Okabe as well), making you want to watch all the missing episodes compulsively .
Overall, it's the perfect anime. Everything, from the physical theories, is perfectly explained, which makes the anime convey all kinds of feelings to the viewer. Steins;Gate has a genial storyline, with great characters, shocking plot twists and a spectacular ending. It is undoubtedly the masterpiece of animes and that deserves to be watched by all humans of this and others worldlines.
This is the choice of Steins;Gate.

                Here is my review for Steins;Gate. I will keep it as simple as possible.
 ART - 3 point
 Man the character designs are terrible. I understand the art style and what‚Äôs coming to me from watching S;G, but except for Okabe, the rest of the cast could be better-looking. No offense to anyone, but Mayuri looks like she has down syndrome with that hat and face LOL. Kurisu white as a ghost and I don‚Äôt find that hot. 
 Sound - 7 point
 Alright the opening and ending song were pretty good. I would definitely suggest listening to them even if the show was bad.Story - 1 point
 Here‚Äôs what hit S;G hard. First half of the series wasted so much time. There was like 3 eps wasted to find the IBN comp, whole lotta useless talk added. Very boring ! Just when I thought I got to the 2nd half of the series and it‚Äôs gonna become thrilling, I find PLOTHOLES that ruins the story and I will explain.
 ********SPOILER********
 It turns out Moeka was working for Sern. But why would Okabe give some random stranger Moeka that threatened him by taking his picture, private contact info in the first place??? and even invite her to club. I wouldn't give a stranger who stopped me in the street anything. Okabe let the wolf in by opening the door. It was really dumb.
 First time, Sern breaks in, Mayuri was shot dead, Okabe was captured. Why didn't SERN confiscate all the equipment at that point right at the site? Sern was interested in what Okabe has uncovered anyways, hence he was not shot dead like Mayuri. So okkk....., I assume Okabe sucessfully turns back time the FIRST time after escaping. At that point, Okabe tries to change Mayuri's fate, Okabe runs around, SERN really should have the brain to destroy or confiscate the lab while they trying to capture Okabe. In addition, Okabe out on the streets, he's running. SERN got cars, how did he outrun Sern back to the lab. Even by foot, giving chase, Sern can always corner Okabe. Okabe is helpless without the lab. This is a GIANT PLOTHOLE because if Okabe remained captured, there wouldn't even be a continuation of the story you know of, or it would just be end of story.

 Characters were all terrible. I will explain that too. *Minor Spoiler Alert
 Okabe - Big arrogant, smartass, (sometimes funny, but limited) 
 Mayuri - Do do do!!! is she 5 years old, retarded? 
 Ruka - WTH? Yes i Clearly understand her gender changes after the D-Mail incident! But first of all, if her gender change, why does she ""LOOK"" the same, I would really appreciate it if there were some minor look differences seriously. That's not all, Why were Okabe and the Computer Geek ""Turned on"" when Ruka was cosplaying wearing a dress when She was a MALE at that time??? That's Disgusting!!! 
 Kurisu - Stop acting like a tsundere to every single little thing. 
 Daru (Computer Geek) - nonstop, overused lame hentai jokes not even funny anymore. 
 Moeka - Can you talk? Stop texting even when you right in front of Okabe soooo annoying. Also stop taking pictures, that's really annoying doing that without consent, I woulda tossed her ass out if that‚Äôs Real life. 
 Feyris - IS that HOW you TALK? I can understand you talk all MOE in the cafe, I can understand! But outside her job, she Talk all Nyan Nyan, wTfff? LMAO Am i supposed to think ya cute ? 
 Suzuha ‚Äì Although I can understand why, she feels too hostile to be liked.
 Enjoyment - 1 point
 I do not understand how S;G was entertaining. I really tried liking it, but couldn't. First half was slowww and too boring, second half was expecting mindfckk, but got none of that. I didn't even care for Mayuri, so honestly I felt nothing when she died LOOOL.
 My final score for S;G would unfortunately have to be a 1, it wasn‚Äôt epic or enjoyable. Even if the last few episodes of S;G were good, a few ""good"" episodes can't save the show. For TRUE Epicness, and Brilliance, I recommend heading on to Death Note xD",1

                I just recently finished watching Steins;Gate and I must admit that I have been quite obsessed ever since. Words can barely describe how blown away I was by the end of the show, but for the sake of the review, I will do my best.
I was hooked from the first episode. I'll be honest and say that it never bothered me one bit that it took a while for the plot to heat up. I think that doing it the way that they did worked out fine, because it gave a solid understanding of all the characters and set everything up nicely for ultimately one
                  of the most heart-wrenching conflicts I have ever seen. I thought it was laid out perfectly; the show gave subtle hints throughout entire first part of it and I knew something huge was bound to happen. But despite all the foreshadowing, I feel that it was executed so well that when disaster finally struck, I didn't even know what hit me. One could argue that it was too abrupt, I guess, but like I said, I personally loved it. Plus, it's not easy to pull off a story about time travel as well as Steins;Gate does. Sure, there were a couple of things that didn't quite make sense, but they were minor enough that the detail and depth that went into the show's plot took my breath away. For the most part, it all fit together extremely well.
Anyway, as for the art... I've seen better, but that's not usually a huge deal for me. I wasn't distracted, so there wasn't a problem. I liked the soundtrack-cool opening theme and music that went well with each scene.
As for the characters, I really have nothing negative to say about them. Whether or not I like the characters is a big factor in how much enjoyment I find in an anime, and I was not disappointed here. I have to say, though, that as far as the characters went, it was really Okabe and Kurisu that made the show for me. Both of them are really cool as characters in my opinion, and they are even cooler together! The chemistry and their interactions are just genius. I love them to death :) 
I liked all the other characters, although none of them resonated with me quite like Okabe and Kurisu. Truthfully, few of the other characters seemed to have depth that matched those two. I noticed that some of them, like Ruka and Feyris, were less developed and seemed to be used mainly as plot devices. Still, I can't really complain too much about that, because it didn't take away from my overall enjoyment in the least.
As a whole, I have to say that Steins;Gate is one of the best anime I have ever seen. It was brilliantly executed and such a breathtaking emotional rollercoaster that I would recommend it to any anime fan. Or any person who likes stories an shows about time travel, for that matter.",10

                I have been digging for some anime with good plots and something that would wow me for a while. This anime to me is a masterpiece in every ways possible to the point that I‚Äôm giving my first review for it. There are many good things that I enjoy from the anime and here are my ratings
Story: 10/10
Steins gate talks about a man who calls himself ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù named Okabe Rintarou and at first glimsp, it may sounds a bit corny but there are reasons why he is that ‚Äúmad‚Äù. Since the main theme of Steins gate is Sci Fi and it talks mainly about
                  time traveling, things can get messy and probably can result in having many plot holes but it doesn‚Äôt, everything is executed perfectly as well as the plot itself is very thrilling and entertaining. The majority finds steins gate to be quite boring in the first few episodes but there are people who were hooked on because of it‚Äôs ‚Äúuniqueness‚Äù. The story indeed does develop a lot and it feels like a ‚Äúfeel train‚Äù as the watchers are having a ride full of emotions with Rintarou. Overall, words aren‚Äôt enough to describe this anime‚Äôs plot, to me, the word that comes closest to describe is ‚Äúmind-blowing‚Äù
Art: 9/10
Steins gate is a ‚Äúdark‚Äù anime, I find the colors having little saturation compare to other anime I have watched. It didnt grab me as much because of its color scheme but then it grew on me. The animation is quite smooth, some parts has bright lighting that suit perfectly. However it doesn‚Äôt get a 10/10 because its nothing special all in all.
Sound: 10/10
‚ÄúHacking to the gate‚Äù is in my top 5 favourite openings and here‚Äôs why. The lyrics really summarize the whole anime quite well and the music is very addictive as it gives the vibe of the themes SciFi and Drama. The OP gives an introduction for the characters without spoiling anything but it has its depth. The OST in gerenal fits quite well in the right moments and at some parts, it has shedded some tears. In general, I have no complaint about the sound in Steins Gate
Character: 9/10
Steins Gate has successfully developed Okabe and many other characters throughout. Every actions being done by the characters are reasonable and it‚Äôs pretty easy to empathy with every characters. I would say that there‚Äôs nothing I would change in terms of character development except for giving Faris a deeper development because imo she doesn‚Äôt get enough screen times.
Enjoyment: 10/10
As I have stated before, it was an extremely addictive experience ride watching Steins Gate, there are many plot twists that work so well. It‚Äôs one of the few animes that I can rewatch with full enjoyment because there are many details that can be missed out if you don‚Äôt pay attention. There are some comedic scenes that are not cringey and really keep us viewers entertained with the heavy plot. The science aspect from this anime got me hooked because I understanded some parts from it but I have never knew that this anime were ‚Äúheavy‚Äù. Overall, I really enjoyed this anime as I was binge watching the anime 10 hours straight when I first watched it.
Overall: 10/10
Steins gate This is easily a masterpiece in the anime industry. From a philosophical standpoint, this anime has portraited how we can decide our future and not by letting fate take control of our action, the future can be changed in our perspective only if we would actually change ourself and fight for it. The anime itself is very deep in terms of meanings but still maintaining its entertainment sides. In the end, I would recommend this to mostly anyone who enjoys time traveling stories or even people who likes anime with a well constructed plot. However, there are many people say that the anime is boring in the first 12 episodes and I totally understand, but if you enjoy mysterious plot like me, the first 12 episodes are actually quite nice. So, what I have to say about this anime is: watch it and you won‚Äôt regret it, even though I know that people‚Äôs tastes are different but there is a high chance that this will become your most favourite anime of all time like me.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is about a self proclaimed(Okabe Rintaro) mad scientist who creates a time machine. The time machine works by sending a text message back in time through the use of a modified microwave. He first does this on accident and the the text he sends a text that ends up saving the life of the successful young scientist Makise Kurisu as he saw her get murdered and sent a text saying so at the same time his right hand man was testing the microwave. She becomes curious about his time machine and ends up testing it along with him.
Story:
The story is spectacular. The pacing great
                  and every episode makes progress. It is funny as has a grown up sense of humor along with just being silly. However the comedy it mostly only present in the first half. Throughout the first half the Future Gadget Lab(Okabe and friends) test the microwave by sending d mails or text messages back in time to test the machine, helping various character by sending their request. However like the butterfly effect kicks in and shit goes down taking the story for a dramatic turn and changing its genre from comedy to thriller. The character John Titor is based off John Titor(self proclaimed time traveler present in the early 2000s on the internet), and even SERN is based off CERN. 
Characters:
 The characters are all great. There wasn't a single one I was ever disappointed to see. They are all likable and unique. Their relationships with each other are all developed and  fun to watch. With romance as well as the platonic friendship between Okabe and his childhood friend Mayuri. I especially enjoyed the friendship between Okabe and Mayuri as it's not often you such close friendships between two unrelated people of the opposite sex. The romance was well paced, fun to watch, and led to a lot of development between the two characters. It's not just them who developed though, all characters go through a good amount of development in the series.
Music:
The opening song for this is one of my favorites and really captures the feel of the whole show perfectly. The rest of the soundtrack however doesn't stand out that much, but it was still enjoyable.
Animation:
The animation is good and flows nicely. There really isn't any fanservice to speak of which in my opinion is good since it adds to the seriousness. The character all have unique and likable designs.
Recommended language: 
Japanese or English both are good.",10

                This was, on the whole, a thrilling yet thought-provoking anime. Not the one to watch if you‚Äôre looking for some mindless fun, but apart from that it has almost everything necessary for a good anime - even a brilliant one.
There is a defined, clever and well-paced plot, a fair amount of character development (not for all the characters, but the main few characters are nicely developed) and some strong feels, shocks and tear-jerking moments.
Plot ‚Äì not necessarily original, but done ingeniously. It started slow but then picked up. There were some times I wished that it would move a little faster, or where the character
                  did something frustrating that seemed purely for the plot‚Äôs sake. However, on the whole the plot moved at a good pace, and indeed tied in all the episodes nicely together. It is true that there were some questions that stay largely unresolved at the end, but these questions don‚Äôt really detract from the impact and enjoyment of the anime. After all, time travel isn‚Äôt something that we can fully get our heads round anyway. 
Warning: the plot is quite technical though, if you dislike science as a subject it might take away from your enjoyment a bit.
Art ‚Äì really good. Alternated between dark and light shots to suit the mood, characters were drawn well ‚Äì particularly Okabe‚Äôs expressions ‚Äì and the visual effects (e.g. the ones surrounding the time travel) fitted the theme perfectly.
Sound ‚Äì was nice. Initially I didn‚Äôt like the opening theme song, but it grew on me. The soundtracks and ending theme matched well.
Character development ‚Äì whilst the anime didn‚Äôt focus on developing every character ‚Äì Daru and Mayuri received very little character development - it shone in relation to Okabe. We see him change from a delusional, somewhat irritating and essentially carefree character to a haunted and even deranged one. He learns that all actions have consequences, and goes from taking everything for granted to appreciating what he has and becoming much more selfless. And it actually feels believable, which is rare when a character changes to this extent.
Kurisu‚Äôs character is also developed somewhat, although nowhere near as much as Okabe‚Äôs (for reasons that become obvious). Through the series she becomes less detached and uncaring, begins to appreciate the value of friendship and even becomes better at expressing herself (albeit only slightly).
Enjoyment level ‚Äì very high. This anime made me think. At some points it made me go ‚Äúwow!‚Äù at some points ‚ÄúNOOOOO!‚Äù and at others it almost made me cry. There were also times I just ended up staring at the screen trying to reconcile myself with what I had just seen. Okay, maybe I‚Äôm exaggerating a little ‚Äì there were some points where I became annoyed after all, but, all in all, it was brilliant, and its place on MAL reflects this.
I did struggle with the rating a bit, because I rarely give 10s and this anime did have its faults, but after sitting back for a little and thinking on it I decided to give it one. When I was scrolling down for  the ratings, I was reminded that 10s are for ‚Äòmasterpieces.‚Äô And this was overall a masterpiece.",10
"
                After finishing ""Steins; Gate,"" I was left with a very poignant realization: this show is probably the most satisfying representation of time travel ever created-  from both an artistic and a scientific point of view. 
While it didn't dig quite deep enough in a couple of areas for me to give it a ""masterpiece"" rating, there is no doubt in my mind that this show deserves a place among the ""greats.""
Was it an action show? A romance? A drama? A mystery? Frankly, I have no idea. Steins; Gate is a beautiful combination of various genres, and it balances humor, wit, sorrow, and joy in
                  a way that will leave you both confounded and entranced. Few other series can compare to Steins; Gate's meaningful character development, brilliant artwork, and powerful plot.
This show made me laugh, cry, jump, shout, and think. I suppose you could say that it was worth my time... and I think the same will hold true for you.
NOTE: If you do choose to watch Steins; Gate, make sure you follow it up with the 25th ""bonus"" episode, ""Steins;Gate: Oukoubakko no Poriomania."" It acts as a sort of epilogue, and contains some moments that you won't want to miss. After you see that one, there is also a 1.5 hour long film called ""Steins;Gate Movie: Fuka Ryouiki no D√©j√† vu."" It takes place a year after the events in ""Oukoubakko no Poriomania,"" and is on par with the excellence of the original show. I'd encourage you to watch both of those! 
Finally, there is an optional (and much more depressing) ending to the show, called ""Steins;Gate: Kyoukaimenjou no Missing Link - Divide By Zero."" I haven't seen it, and I don't plan to; but it's there if you have any interest in seeing it once you finish the rest!",9
"
                It's definitely the greatest anime I've ever watched, this is perfect in everything. I enjoyed it so much and nothing was boring, the anime can hold your attention
so easily with the creative dialogues and the interest character its has. In terms of writhing the first half is so good, but in ""emotion"" the second half obviously is better. Really like how this show makes so grabbed in the story, probably you're gonna say the plot is pretty simples, and it is, but it's so good wrote that you really wanna go the next episode, as I said before. Basically, I love Steins;Gate and more people
                  should watch it =D",10
"
                My personal top 1 anime, Steins;Gate stained me forever with a variety of concepts, and left me craving for more. I'm looking at you, Steins;Gate 0!
History: 10/10 
Okabe Rintarou is a mad scientist who runs a top secret laboratory that invents futuristic apparatus to fight the terrible organization that controls the world from the shadows. At least in his mind, it's just like that. In fact, he spends his time with his friends Mayuri and Daru inventing some devices with junk. Looks like a typical slice of life in the early episodes, but its shine is yet to come: Amid one of his inventions, there
                  is the ""Microwave Telephone"", which features the ability to send messages to the past. Each one is a perfect demonstration of the Butterfly Effect, showing how things that seem insignificant causes a large change in the facts, for starters. Talking more than that would spoil the experience, so I'd rather stop here.
Art: 9/10
The anime art is very good. It may not be perfect, but it combines perfectly with the atmosphere by giving the impression of something more mature. 
Sound: 10/10 
The OP is wonderful, the voice acting is the same as the novel, ergo, outstanding, and the background music just fits into the atmosphere of the anime perfectly.
Characters: 10/10 
All the characters are great, but the highlight is Okabe. The character growth could not be better worked. The shock of it with the new reality that he must face is something memorable. As for the other characters, after a few episodes it seems like you know them for a long time. You get quite attached to them.
Enjoyment: 10/10 
With all the positives mentioned above, I think I do not really have much to explain. It makes you laugh and suffer, and makes you reflect on the presented concepts.
What are you still doing here? Go watch Steins; Gate right now!",10
"
                Sometimes you get stuck in a situation and you do everything you can to get out of it. You fight and claw, and you don't know if it'll work and you're kind of confused and you just keep trying. That's the underlying story here in Steins;Gate. But the mediums it uses to tell this story are what make it one of my favorites out there so far. 
First let's look at the story aspect of it, which I gave a 10. Sure I've already talked about the underlying story, but the way that different theories of time travel are explained might be one of my
                  favorite aspects of this anime. It was very intellectually stimulating, and it was explained in layman's terms, which is certainly a difficult feat to accomplish. Here we have a story about a mad scientist college student who randomly discovers that he can send text messages back in time to change the past. Through various requests, he ends up adding a number of new lab members and finds that while the world around him changes completely, his ""Reading Steiner"" ability allows him to remember what the world used to be like on the former ""world line"". Then a whole bunch of other interesting stuff happens that makes him want to undo everything, and herein lies the dilemma mentioned at the beginning of this review. I'm not going to tell you exactly what it is, because the surprise of it was part of what made this anime so memorable. But the rest of the plot plays out based on this dilemma and it is done better than many of the other time travel stories I have come across. The story was definitely interesting and didn't have many dull moments or plot holes.
The art is one of the best I've seen as well, the animation is impeccable, and the show overall looks the part. I give it a 10.
I loved both the dub and the subs, and the opening is one of my favorite of all time, so I give the sound a 10 as well. The voice actors all fit their characters well, and our main character, Okarin, is made into the perfect Crazy Mad Scientist.
The characters were all developed quite well, though some of the minor characters who join the club later are somewhat glossed over compared to the main characters, although this isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, it did drop it to an 8, though a lot of that might be because I needed some part of the anime not to give a 10 to. The relationships between Mayuri and Okarin and between Kurisu and Okarin are very well fleshed out and were quite memorable.
This anime was one of the most enjoyable for me to watch, as I ended up watching the whole thing in just a couple of days over summer break. It kept me gripped, and I'm sure it will to anyone else who keeps an open mind while watching it. Therefore, I give it a 10.
Overall I give Steins;Gate a 10, and have recommended it to everyone from my mom to my best friends.",10
"
                Many people have been telling me to watch this anime ever since it was released. I'm not gonna lie, it took me the longest to watch it because I never got around to.
I just finished it, and I have to say: this is probably one of the best, most thoroughly executed animes I have ever seen, and that is truly saying something.
The concept of time travel in anime isn't new. However, Steins;Gate takes the theme of time travel and truly puts it to good use. There weren't any plot holes, and everything had an explanation. One of the great things about this show is that
                  there are rules set to the world, and these rules are tangible and they make sense. Another amazing aspect to this show are the characters. Each character introduced, no matter how minuscule or basic they seem in the beginning, add a layer of complexity and detail to the storyline, creating engaging episodes that leave me hungry for the next one.
If you are having any doubts about this anime: just watch it. I promise you, you will not regret it.",10
"
                This is a ""visual novel"" anime, and as such, it is predictable, has weak/filler plot/concepts, and is like a slice-of-life. 
The story is written by someone adept but falls short in execution in many/every way because it was never meant to exceed the boundaries, the limits of a typical visual novel.
Despite its weak points, it is enjoyable if you like (this type of) slice-of-life anime. It is comparable in genre, in audience, to ""Spice and Wolf"". Appealing to the emotions, mostly irrelevant story.

                Steins; Gate: the paragon of what a good Sci-Fi/Drama anime should strive to be. 
This anime is obviously listed as #2 on the site right behind FMAB, and there is a reason. The story is phenomenal. When the series first starts, it has a light hearted, cheery tone, and is still entertaining in that regard, until about halfway through, when it analyzes and go in depth with all the major characters, and transforms the protagonist from a funny scientist to a man clearly on the brink of insanity. Although the art style may annoy one at first, this series is definitely worth it. Amazing anime.

                Okay this is my first review ever. I've watched anime for a couple of years now but I just felt like I had to write a review for this anime. 
First, I'd like to warn all of you that is planing or is start to watch this anime. Do not listen to anyone who keep pestering you to watch it or claimed that ""Stein; gate"" is the best anime of all time. This anime is pretty much a hit or a miss anime for majority. If you're the type of person who doesnt get hook on the first 6 episode of this anime then give
                  up now. 
Honestly, I've had my doubt with this anime for a long time now since I tried out episode one of the anime but it was so confusing and frustrating so I stopped and recently picked it up again because of all the hype. And honestly, episode two to 7 was amazing. It hooked me right in and I found myself watching it through the night til 8AM. However, after episode 7, the anime became kind of tasteless and boring and dont expect anything good to happen until episode 12. 
But let me tell you this, a lot of expectations and hypes wont get you no where and will only disappoint. People on forums and blogged I've read that the anime picked up at episode 12 but I beg to differ. From the whole series, the anime was really amazing from beginning and to end but the middle was just utter irritation to me. Not that I'm saying it was bad (B/c I enjoyed it too due to intro to the whole picture and plot and alot of twist and turns as well as the unexpected) but it was also had some vaguely unexplained things and small mistakes. From episode 12 to 17 was tedious for me because it was was the epitome of character development. 
Let me tell you about the characters which I had given a score of 7. Aside from Kurisu, Okabe, Suzu, every other characters was utterly useless and under developed. I would have to agree that all of them contribute greatly in developing the story and such  as well as pushing the character development of Okabe. Firstly, they had focused Okabe attention way too much on Mayuri. She was pretty much the most useless character in the whole series as she was shown to be completely ignorant of everything around her in the whole 22 episodes. TOO-TOO-DOOO. Man that was so annoying. Also, character such as Ruka, Rumiho, Itaku, although helped moved the story along, was pretty much irrelevant to the whole story beside the fact that Okabe had to reversed everything in the end. 
Most likely most people agree on that the character Okabe, Suzu and Kurisu actions and appearance in the series completely overshadowed every other character. Although following the manga I did not understand why they had spend it on developing the side character instead of the relationship between Kurisu and Okabe as in the end, proved to be the most important to each other. Although I admitted I did not like the twist at the end that they say they loved each other before returning to the first world line, I'd have to give credit to the artist and producer for that kissing scene and how unexpected and developed it was like riding a roller coaster. It would have been much better in my opinion that they had spend a few episode between 15 and 20 or in the beginning to help developed the relationship between the two. 
Over all, this was a very unique series, unique concepts, unique characters and definitely worth checking out even if its not your type of anime. The ending was, again, amazing and thrilling as the only answer to the problem the protagonist struggle with through the whole show and even almost to breaking point was where it started. This was very well made and it will keep you wanting to know more. Although most of us had expected a tragic ending, the ending was very unexpectedly a very heart warming and a cute ending. May we all follow the choice of Steins Gate to a whole new future.",9
"
                Steins;Gate, I have been so fortunate, as to watch and understand and enjoy this as I have. This anime is clearly an exceptional masterpiece, and for good reason. Let's start with the plot. 
          The plot is riveting and interesting, full of surprises, development, and a plethora of plot twists and thickening. It gives time to develop its characters and premise into something of quality, with 25 episodes as evidence. Think of this anime like a pot roast, it takes time to make a good one. It also does a fantastic job of showing and not
                  telling, with its lack of exposition abuse, and it's effective, and effectively timed use of literary devices. Examples include flash forward, flashback, foreshadow, elements of mystery and suspense, comic relief, atmosphere, theme and etc. It has effective placements of sound as well, along with effective use of visual assets, especially for plot transitions. Those are common, as the plot shifts, changes, and twists, leaving the viewer in constant suspense. 
          Just as important to the story, are it's characters, and Steins;Gate doesn't fail in this department, but rather succeeds with flying colors. Enter the protagonist, Okabe Rintaro. An admirable character whose actions and motives, as well as the plot itself, effectively reflects the OP; Hacking to the Gate, but, I'll mention music later. Anyway, Okabe Rintaro is a self-proclaimed mad scientist who is the leader of a laboratory, the ""Future Gadget Laboratory"" which invents, as the name suggests, future gadgets. Okabe however, is a scientist, and maybe a little bit of an engineer, as evidenced by his major contributions and pioneering of several Gadgets, and even more as the story progresses. His personality is, I'd like to say, split, but not in the colloquial sense. Often, we see him transition between two characters, Okabe Rintaro, and Hououin Kyouma. The former is level headed, serious, and a realist who cares deeply of his friends. The latter, is where the ""mad scientist"" part shows, as Hououin Kyouma is a paranoid, mad, delusional, arrogant, ambitious scientist. This is by far, his most interesting personality, but isn't genuine. Most of his friends in this state would call him delusional too, and is hard for them to take seriously. However, that's when you'll come to like the character of Okabe Rintaro. This character is also well done, and developed, he's rich and fleshed out. 
          Next off, is the main Heroine, Shiina Mayuri, or Mayusii, you may already know this character due to her fame in memes, and adorability, or moe, I think it's called. Her memorable line, ""Tu-Tu-Ruu"" is enough for many to smile, simply out of cuteness. She serves as Okabe's childhood friend, with a light, cute, and somewhat dumb, character, but not in a bad way by any means. She's also naive and likes to cosplay. She's more than just a damsel for the protagonist, as her importance, and story, are laid out across the anime. It is through this character that development to the protagonist is fortified mutually, with each character gaining in value as you watch. 
          Next, Makise Kurisu. This character is almost a contrast to Mayushii, as her character is serious and arrogant, but is contrasted by her shyness and bashfulness, which comes often enough. Did I mention she's a tsundere? No, not the comically overt, ""Baka! Baka! Baka!"" Tsundere, but rather the more sublime, cute, and genuinely likeable types. Okabe and Makise constantly argue and mess around and insult one another, but are both scientists and dear friends. She is also constantly annoyed at Okabe as well for many reasons you've seen/will see/hope to see you see in Steins;Gate. Their ""conflict"" is what springs character development, friendship, comraderie, and it furthers the Future Gadget Laboratory, as Makise Kurisu is a talented, honored American scientist. Without her, the amazing plot that exists in Steins;Gate wouldn't exist, and neither would alot of the comic relief either, especially that comic relief that comes from a certain pervert.... 
          Enter Hashida Itaru, or Daru. Daru is a fat, perverted hacker with a keen sense of dirty jokes, references, computers, and hacking. He also likes moe, and frequents a maid cafe with our protagonist, occasionally hin talking about girls and perverted imaginings. Other than that, his character is nothing outlandish, except for maybe him being an otaku and being well versed in its culture. His defining characteristics are his tech savvy, and perversion, yet his importance as a character is truly shown later in the anime, similar to the character, Kiryu Moeka. 
          Kiryu Moeka however, is a real oddball. She's very silent, retracted, and overall mysterious. She prefers using her phone rather than speaking, but when she does, her voice is very faint, but direct. However she has great relevance in this anime, being part of a major plot twist and many more riveting events. She's very disconnected from the other characters as well, in terms of being their friends. Her defining trait is her mystery, but that doesn't mean she's an irrelevant or bad character. Without her, well I can't say without spoiling. Make no mistake on this character, for she isn't irrelevant as you'll see later in the anime, this character in question is, Suzuha Amane. 
          Not much can be said about Suzuha Amane without spoilers, but she is a friendly, athletic person, who dislikes Makise Kurisu, and is a friend to Okabe Rintaro, and isn't bothered by his delusion as Hououin Kyouma. She's interested by the Future Gadget Laboratory's work however. All I can say is that this character is very important, but only shows it later, and until then, you may be fooled into thinking she is irrelevant. Without her, a major ally to Okabe is lost, and he would fail surely in the story. These are the four main characters in Steins;Gate, effectively developed too. 
          It's not just those major things in Steins;Gate that count, it's the little things too, like music. The music is very good to say the least. The OP is great and so is the ED. The OP effectively relates and foreshadows the story, the ED is similar too. In the anime, the music is placed effectively to provide loads of suspense, which is one of its attributing factors to its greatness. The visuals and the art style are good, nothing more, the atmosphere is a whole new world though, building suspense by the artists' use of darker colors, it reflects the some of the grit and gloom, while also making sure it's possible to have comic relief and happy times. 
          The premises and theme of the anime, being time and time travel, are foreshadowed in the OP and revealed in the anime albeit later, and with no exposition, but through revealing it naturally with the characters. It is definitely Interesting. The OP was beautiful, both versions. The second is the same as the first but with different words, it's actually the same OP! As the anime changes, the OP fits this, and it reflects the fact that the situation is the same, but details are different, relative to the story when the OP changes, very impressed. As a piece of music, it sounds wonderful too, and the art during the OP reflects the premises and theme of the anime, clocks and gears with snippets of the characters, resembling time. It was wonderful, and it is a wonderful example of foreshadow. 
          Lastly, the execution of this anime was exceptional, and unique, and fricken godly. The use of suspense, transitions, transformations, plot twists and more made it hard to put down. Even it's in anime universe made it so immersive, even though it was minimal. The visual transitions also were good, did their job of notifying me of a setting change. It didn't use too much exposition either, which is commendable in it of itself. The plot changes and twists were also well executed and clear, I wasn't in confusion at all. The good execution of this anime's story and it's premises are what make it so good. That is why Steins;Gate is a 10/10, it wasn't rushed, had an interesting premise, good characters and development, it's story was executed brilliantly, and used lots of literary devices and it kept me in suspense and surprised me with its plot twists. The music was great, visuals were good, OP was good, and it contribute to foreshadow and suspense. I would recommend this anime to anyone. It's a good watch and I suggest you do watch it, it's practically a hallmark of anime period.",10
"
                I was recommended this anime by my friend early on in my anime watching adventure. A lot of my friends told me this was good foreshadowing my high expectations which were succeeded.
It takes a while before the anime gets to the main story but it's all worth it as it gets you attached to the unique characters that are shook throughout the anime. 
Story: 10/10  (nothing wrong, brilliant)
Art: 8/10  (older artstyle that suits well)
Sound: 8/10  (great intro, good soundtrack)
Character: 8/10  (some characters were underdeveloped but the ones that were were good)
Enjoyment: 9/10  (completely binged watched half of it from 11-4)
Overall,
                  I recommend this anime to anyone that wants to a Sci-Fi/Drama/Thriller. 10/10",10

                looking at the top anime list , ranked #2 is steins;gate 
i expected it to be an awesome anime and started watching it and thought an anime with just 25 episodes how could it make top 2 
after watching the first 2 episodes i got disappointed and stopped watching it 
but out of curiosity i started watching it again 
i was actually awestruck !!!
i really would have regretted it if i dint watch this anime 
it really is a masterpiece
the way it sinks into the plot , it is a slow one but as the episodes keep going you get involved in it 
you feel like you are one of the characters in the anime 
the way the plot is dealt with , the way the story reels around the characters
its just amazing 
one of the best anime's i have ever watched
if you are into thriller and sci-fi then this is a MUST WATCH ANIME SERIES !!!
i really wish it had another season",10
"
                This review may contain major spoilers. I have to point out that I havent finished the second season because I wanted to rewatch the original one first and I havent played the VNs either.
I know that most of the people wont even try to read this because Steins Gate is a famous show who everyone have watched, played or reviewed. I also know that I wont do justice to this fucking masterpiece because there are some things that are out of my understanding, but I will try to express my feelings towards this series as good as I can.
Well, 2 years after I finished Steins
                  Gate, I was wondering why I kept it as my favorite anime even after I watched another shows that I fell in love with like Monster, Fate Zero, FLCL etc... So I decided to watch it again. And Im surprised of how much this show hooked me again even if I knew what was about to happen.
I tried to be as objective as I could while rewatching it so I could make the best review I was capable of. And I didnt found any major flaw which could lead to the dethronement of this anime.
The most common argument people use for dropping this show or just to say this anime is not as good as it fandom believe is that the first 12 episodes are so slow paced they cant stand it at all. And yes, they are slow as fuck, but they are completely necessary for the 2nd half of the anime to be as good as it is.
The characters are introduced together with the different ways they use to travel through time, while explaining the rules of those time travels. You need that first half of the show to understand what Okabe is doing in the second one and why every character act like they do. 
In adittion, some of the episodes dont seem to contribute to the progress of the story as much as they should and we can find some plot holes or convenient plot twists (Okabe being the only person who can maintain his memories after they send a D-mail) so the story can go on. I have read comments of people who complain about how innocent and carefree Okabe is about the D-mails info. I can understand somebody can get mad at it because it leads to Mayuri death, but the characters would have never imagine how important the experiments they were doing at a ""labo"" would be.
If you are not bothered by the slow pacing and those little flaws, you will reach to episode 12, where the real Steins Gate begins.
I will talk about the story and characters after I give my opinion about the art and sound sections.
The weakest point of Steins Gate is, in my honest opinion, its art. Character desings can trigger some people because how wide is the range they cover. In one hand you have simple desings like Okabe or Daru while in the other hand you get to see eccentric character desings (Feyris). Anyway, the story is carried out in Akihabara, the moest place in the world, where a lot of ""weird looking"" people get along with ""normal looking"" folks. 
The animation isnt the best and sometimes characters movement may feel a little bit unnatural but, does a psychological anime where characters spend most of their time talking need an extraordinary animation? It doesnt.
Even if the animation is overall, the amount of detail which is used in the face expressions always impress me. In addition, you wont spot a bad use of CGI.
The soundtrack is perfect. It doesnt need to have amazing battle songs or an impressive variety of beautiful themes because the dialogue is way more significant. 
Anyway, there are some songs that will captivate you and the different variations of Gate of steiner are 10/10.
The opening is amazing. Kanako Itou is a phenomenal artist and Im always satisfied with her work. Im pretty sure I will enjoy her tracks when I play the VN.
I dont personally find the ED as good as the OP, but when it is mixed with a cliffhanger it works better than I would have expected.
The seiyuus are amazing. I fell in love with Mamoru Miyano's voice when I first watched Steins Gate in early 2017. After 2 years and a lot of other characters roles he plays that I have seen, I can say that Okabe is the best voice acting this seiyuu has ever done. The way he is able to switch the tone of Okarin's voice from the mad bastard he is in the early part of the show to how fucking sad and disturbed he sounds after all the Mayuri's death thing is amazing. 
I love when Mamoru's characters tear apart and their voice starts to crack (Kida, Light, Yao Ling...).
But Mamoru isnt alone in this show, because other members of the cast do a great job too. Nishimura (Kurisu's VA) does a great job, specially in the last episodes of the show and we all love the fucking tuturu.
After the slow-paced first half of the show, we get to the good part. From episode 12 to 22, Okabe lives the same days one time and another, witnessing the death of his best friend to the point he almost end up losing his sanity. When he realizes he cant prevent Mayuri's death, he asks Kurisu for help, just to find out he has to revert everything he has done for his friends in the first half of the story. Then, Steins Gate starts to explore topics like the feeling of guilt, sexuality and death itself one more time. If Okabe wants to save Mayushii, he has to destroy his friends' wishes first. When he finally revert one of the last D-mails (feeling responsible of all the pain he has caused to his friends) he realizes that he cannot save Mayuri without ""killing"" Kurisu. Just WOW.
The amount of emotions this show cause on the viewer while developing a complicated story about one of the most difficult themes not only in anime, but in every type of media (without almost any plot hole) is impressive. The end of an episode can be sad asf but in the next one you will find yourself smiling just to come back to the sad reality a few mins later.
When an anime decides to introduce a lot of plot twists to its story, it can be counter-productive for it, but it doesnt happen with SG. The way they tell us the truth behind this journey in little amounts of info is so great. My head almost explode when I realized that Okabe was the one who killed Kurisu (that paradox is so hard to understand). The show knows how to keep you hooked to the story so well.
I think is impossible for me not to rush the second part of the show in 1-2 days, and the 2 final episodes are so good that I go to the first one just to say, ""Thats why Kurisu said that wow"" one time and another EVEN IF I HAVE SEEN THE 1ST EPISODE LIKE 10 TIMES.
The narrative of this anime is pure gold and I enjoyed the first part a lot too.
Everytime I watch an anime with a small cast I remember Steins Gate. You can count the amount of characters who get a decent quantity of screen time with your hands. Every character gets his own development or background, from the main cast to characters like Mr. Braum, a person whose only role in the show was to scold Okabe.
Okabe's personality changes radically as the show goes on, due to all the shit he went through. As every anime fan knows, the ""I love my friends and I will do everything I can for them"" is way too used in this type of media and even if Okabe works like that, he doesnt feel as a cliche character at all (at least for me). I love early Steins Gate Okabe as much as I love the latest one. The personality of this guy captivated me from the very beggining and when I saw how he developed from a mad scientist to a sad scientist (I know that joke is already dead) I felt in love even more whit this character. 
We saw him for 2 episodes trying to save Mayuri one time and another while he was destroying himself, fighting against the fatalism of the Steins Gate world destiny. Some people could say he is annoying, but I loved every minute he was in screen.
Sadly, Im not an expert on characters psychological dissection, but if you check Aleczandxr's youtube channel videos about SG you will discover how amazing this guy is.
I think that I already talked a lot about him so I will talk about the other 2 most important characters of this story: Kurisu and Mayuri.
Kurisu is the genius every sci-fi anime has and she seems to fulfill the role of the typical tsundere. For the most part of the show she is just used as a tool to understand the D-mail system and to develop the time-leap machine. She doesnt send any D-mail, she doesnt affect the rest of the cast yet and her only function is to have some funny interactions with Okabe (which I personally love).
However, when Okabe starts to fall into depression and he thinks he will never be able to save Mayuri, Kurisu appears to become the main pillar that maintains Okabe's mental state. Due to her intelligence, Okarin doesnt doubt to tell her what is happening and this is so important for both Rintarou and the story. 
By the end of the show, she is mature enough to realize that the best option is to save Mayuri, and she tries to convince Okabe even if she knows that she will die, which means she wouldnt be able to keep living with the person she felt in love with. Awesome writting.
In the other hand, I dont find Mayuri as good as Kurisu is, but I recognise how important she is to the plot, as the only thing Okabe has in mind for half of the show is to save her friend.
I was surprised to find out I was crying with the final scene, just to realize AGAIN how much I fucking love this series. 
I think im going to watch the movie and all the OVAs again lol.
Steins Gate is and will be forever my favorite show.",10
"
                This is my very first review on an anime on MAL. I'll keep a pattern for all my reviews and all the reviews will be spoiler-free.I will start of with a a mini paragraph of what i thought of the anime with PROS/CONS and with the final scores.
- Steins;Gate is a sci/fi thriller at its core where you have these different characters experience different kinds of events throughout the whole season.Most people call this anime a masterpiece and guess what?They are right.It is hard to compare this anime to another entry because there hasn't been one made on the same level
- The artwork in the
                  anime is more of a darker tone which works well for this anime and the eerie music that comes up during some parts is perfect for this show.Like i mentioned before the characters is what makes this anime so special because everyone is given an arc to deal with which leads to some great reveals too!Everyone will probably have their favorite character of the series of which mine being Mayuri.
PROS:
1.Despite having very darker tone it actually has a lot of light hearted moments throughout the series not making it over dramatic
2.There are lots of twists and reveals and some of that will leave you stunned :D
3.The suspense/tension filled moments are great fully done as it keeps you on the edge of your seat
4.Intresting easter eggs to other shows taking place in the same universe
5.It's rare when you see both the sub and dub being equally good
CONS:
1.This is not actually a con but the show does adopt a ""slow burn method"" till episode 9 after which it starts to go fast.To me it was fine because i like to take my time watching it but it could bother some people.
2.Also for people using this anime as starters might be a little confused on the second half of the season.These are not even cons lol, it's because the show is that good.
OVERALL THOUGHTS:
Story: 10/10
Art: 9/10
Sound: 9/10
Character: 10/10
Enjoyment: 10/10
OVERALL SCORE: 9.6 ==> 10
Thank you and i hope this was helpful :)",10

                Too too roo! I'm sure that most people out there are familiar with at least one ""time-travel"" anime. When faced with this type of anime it's easy to overlook plot holes as the story can become confusing and lost within itself. Steins;Gate has taken on this plot without falling into these traps; this anime is by far the best ""time-travel"" anime that I've come across or one of the best anime I've come across in general and I'm positive many can agree!
Story: 9/10
The story is based on Rintarou Okabe (Hououin Kyouma), his (Original) lab members, Hashida ""Daru"" Itaru and Shiina ""Mayushii"" Mayuri and their encounters
                  with time-travel. After reading reviews on Steins;Gate you would expect this anime to be action-packed and intense. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Steins;Gate is just that and more however not many would expect the confusing and slow nature to the start of this series. The first few episodes would make you wonder, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs all the hype about?‚Äù as the beginning of the anime is random and has no explanation, which I deem is the reason why many people may have dropped Steins;Gate the first time around watching. But, but! Though this series may have started off slow-paced, after 1/3 of the anime you are guaranteed what you‚Äôve heard about Steins;Gate.
Unlike many time travel animes, Steins;Gate is consistent, with no noticeable/significant plot holes. Being a time travel anime, it‚Äôs hard for everyone to agree on the rules of time travel that Steins;Gate has agreed on as no one has experienced time travel themselves therefore everyone will have different theories; of which I‚Äôve read in Kissanime‚Äôs comment section. However you can‚Äôt expect a science FICTION anime to abide with every rule on time travel, black holes etc, in a science textbook. Steins;Gate‚Äôs take on time travel is adventurous yet agrees with simple rules such as the ‚Äúbutterfly affect‚Äù by doing so, the anime is more realistic without losing points on its interest factor. From around episode 9 and onwards this series begins to unravel its true thrilling nature which leaves the viewers‚Äô itching to watch the next episode. 
Personally, I don‚Äôt think that a story needs to have a happy ending to be good. Steins;Gate gradually works its way to what I think was a disappointing ending. By taking on a ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù, the ending is rushed and vast. Though the dejavu moment at the end is quite lovely, I think a more disastrous end would‚Äôve left more of an impression. 
Art: 7/10
The art is one of the more lacking factors. The design is neither unbearable nor outstanding but simple and more realistic. The anime was made with a low-budget therefore you can‚Äôt expect too much however the lack of unique design is outbalanced by the enthralling story.
Sound: 7/10
Great voice acting, especially by Mamoru Miyano and Kana Hanazawa who are the voice actors of Rintarou Okabe and Mayushii. Good opening but not of my taste, I had watched it separately at the end of the anime so I could write this review on it, the ending as well. The background music and the soundtracks were mediocre, I‚Äôm sure there were more opportunities when Steins;Gate could have made more of the BGM.
Characters: 10/10
The characterization in this series is amazing. The characters have a great impression which makes you bound to them. There‚Äôs not so much of a character development, I‚Äôll leave it to you to decide if Kurisu‚Äôs Tsundere behaviors counts. The only character which drastically develops is Okabe: he changes as the world changes around him. The development is exceptionally executed and has a realistic feeling to it as do all the characters in general which makes Steins;Gate all the more gripping.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Steins;Gate is one of the only anime that I could rate 10/10 is the enjoyment factor. Like many people, I found that Steins;Gate started off very random and confusing which put me off however I pushed myself to carry on because of the reviews and ratings. I‚Äôm glad that I did not drop this anime as once the story became more intense I was hooked! Even if sci-fi isn‚Äôt your preference I‚Äôm sure that you‚Äôll love this anime as it includes comedy,romance and more. Don‚Äôt let the first few episodes fool you, this anime is worth every second!

"
                Steins;gate is a slice of life anime that attempts to adapt to a plot forgotten throughout the series for over 11 episodes, with minor references to it that don't add to it in any way. The story that does develop is unbearably slow, spending multiple episodes on a single development with little meaning. There is a massive plothole often overseen that may shorten the anime by about 7 episodes. The art and sound were average, however my main gripe with this anime is regarding the story, which made it excruciatingly painful to watch. The mad scientist that the main character was attempting to pursue had
                  the fatal error of confusing the viewers as to whether he actually was mad, or acting at certain points.",3
"
                That wonderful time has come once again!  The time where I've finally got around to finishing an anime, and now it's time to review all of what I've seen.  And damn, have I seen some good stuff.  Steins;Gate was something that I decided to randomly pick up on a whim one day, and looking back, I'm definitely am glad I did so.
So onto our review of what may be yet another great anime to rock the ages!
Story:  Steins;Gate has a story that bleeds science fiction all over the place, but at the same time maintains a very human aspect.  The
                  main character of the series, Okabe Rinatarou, is thrust into a chaotic mess of trying to mend time after he and his friends radically change it through an invention that can send text messages into the past.  The resulting changes in the time stream end up endangering one of Okabe's closest friends, putting him on a path where he must fight against fate and restore the world's time stream to its original state.  This, at least in my opinion, has to be one of the most interesting and well-executed stories ever made in an anime.  While the physics and details of time travel are not really scientifically accurate, the story itself is still good.  This is mostly because it is more character-driven than anything else, and I found it easy to overlook the inaccuracies and still love the storyline.
Art:  I've yet to play the game this series was based on, so my opinion on the art style could be a little biased.  Still, I thought it was particularly good and did justice to both the male and female characters of the series.  I personally like how it didn't make the female characters look too overly cute and how it didn't turn the male characters into glittering models.  It gave a good mood to the series and wasn't overplayed.
Music:  This is something I really enjoyed in the series.  The music, especially the opening song Hacking To The Gate, was simply fantastic.  The songs fit the mood perfectly, they established a tone to the series, and they were not at all distracting or out of place.  In fact, in episode 23, one character's dialogue wouldn't have been as powerful without the overlying song to strengthen his words.  Overall, the music was great, and very iPod worthy.
Characters:  If I had to pick a favorite part of this series, it would be the characters themselves, which were pretty unique and fun to watch.  Okabe was probably my favorite character of the series, with his ridiculous lines and his dramatic speeches about secret organizations and plots to rule the world.  Makise Kurisu was a fantastic character and a perfect foil to Okabe.  Their romance was also very cute and quite fulfilling towards the end of the series.  As for the rest of the characters, they were also pretty good.  Mayuri had to be my least favorite, but even she had her few shining moments and ended up impressing me towards the series finale.  Overall, the series presented a good cast of characters that didn't bore the viewer one bit.
Enjoyment:  What else is there to say in this department?  I really enjoyed this series.  I'm buying it on DVD the moment it gets released, and I'm probably going to watch it all over again.  This has easily hit my top 5 list.
So overall, I have to give this series a 10.  In reality, it should get a 9, because its only flaw is the lack of plausibility when it comes to the actual time travel.  But because of the interesting characters, the phenomenal story, and the overall satisfying path from episode one to episode twenty-four, I'm giving this series a perfect 10.  I highly recommend this anime to any fan of sci-fi, mad scientists and time travel.  You definitely won't be disappointed one bit.",10
"
                I'm new to anime world, but even I can tell this anime is amazing. I can guarantee you that you're gonna like it.
Story 10/10
This is what is so outstanding in this anime. The story is so perfectly written. This is sort of anime where you have to think really hard to understand what's going on. Many episodes end with a cliffhanger so it lefts confusing feeling. You really can't wait for next episode, but you still want to take your time and think about what happened in this episode.  Some people find first few episodes (or even first half of the series) boring, but
                  I disagree. Every second of the story has important meaning for the plot, and you usually have the feeling ""that was so obvious, how didn't I see it coming"".
Art and sound 8/10
As I previously said, I'm new in watching anime, so I don't know much about this. All I know it didn't annoy me and it didn't attract too much attention, but it wasn't something you would notice.
Characters 10/10
This is another thing that makes this anime so awesome. Every character has their own place in the story, their traits and reasons for what they are doing. They are very well developed. Also, they are very likable. Even people who hate tsundere archetype fell in love with Kurisu, and many people felt sorry for Moeka who does a really terrible thing. 
Enjoyment 10/10
As you can tell, I really enjoyed this anime, and I'm not the only one. Constant change from drama to comedy, and from comedy to drama, here and there with pieces of romance, makes an emotional roller coaster that makes you wanting more.
Overall 10/10 
When you have an amazing story with constant plot twists and really wonderfully written characters, you get a masterpiece. 
PS: Sorry for my bad English.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is an amazing VISUAL NOVEL, but as a anime it was severely butchered, so I cannot rate it any higher than a 6/10. 
Coming to watch the anime right after reading the visual novel was a big disappointment for me. So many scenes and dialogues that further developed the characters were missing in the animated adaptation that I would go as far to say that if you only watched the anime then you havent really experienced the real Steins;Gate.
You dont know the real Okabe Rintaro, and you dont really know any of the other characters in his story.

"
                After giving myself some time to think it over, I've finally decided to write another review, this time for Steins;Gate. I'll try to make it as clear as I can, and I'll start with the story.
Steins;Gate has an interesting topic to start with: time travel. I'll be blunt - time travel both confuses me and is not very interesting to me. This anime uses it in a more interesting way, and I actually kind of liked it. It's not a tale about, ""Oh wow if I could go back and do one thing differently, I'd do this."" It's about simple human curiosity leading to devastating
                  effects, with desperate attempts to fix everything. Not a bad premise, and it executes it well. However, I had to minus a few points for the anime starting out so boringly. If it takes me 6+ episodes to really even care about watching the rest of an anime, I have the feeling that some things are just not being done well. I was told that it was just setting up the story, which in hindsight maybe it was, but it was just done sooo...well, poorly. I felt no real interest in anything. And it seemed as though they tried to explain the science as well, which I feel average people like me just don't understand anyway. However, the story does pick up later (though can still be confusing since they still try to explain the science). The amount of twists near the end was sufficient enough to give this anime some points back. So I give it 7/10, good story.
I have to say that I was however, a little disappointed in the art. It wasn't very poor, but something about the style was just awkward and unlikeable to me. The proportions aren't usually right, and all the females are stick thin with huge tits. Almost half the anime is also way too dark to even be seen, even with max brightness on your screen. The background art was pretty good though, so I give it a 6/10, fair art.
As for sound, it seemed pretty average to me. The Japanese voice actors are really good, actually. Didn't care much for the opening or ending, though, and background music was just eh. 8/10, very good sound.
I think character was where I have the most problems. As I said earlier, I didn't really like the artistic style of any of the characters, but I also didn't really like any of their personalities, nor did I really empathize with them on any level. Besides going through this whole ordeal with Kyouma and seeing him change, all the characters just seem so plain and static. No one has any real redeeming traits, they're all just there to interact with each other. Makise is just a bitch sometimes and then all weird the next, while Mayuuri is just annoying all the time. Daru is simply a pervert. Feyris is also annoying, and Suzuha is even more a bitch. And what's-her-name Shining Finger is the absolute worst. Even at the end, the best any of the characters are is ""okay"" or ""tolerable."" 5/10, mediocre character.
As far as enjoyment, I did actually enjoy this anime, at least a little bit. I could have lived with or without seeing it and be just as happy. Really not my cup of tea here, but maybe there's just something that I'm missing, because everyone else seems to love this anime to no end. Overall, it gets a 7 from me, a good anime.",7

                if you like scifi and action then steins gate is the anime for you. i loved it and i think that it is amazing but it wasn't perfect  because  at the beginning of the anime you get some what confused to whats going on and then in  the first half you start to get a little thrown off by getting a lot of slice of life and scifi but very little action but then it redeems its self by blowing your mind away and playing with your emotions without caring about your reaction but in a good way it leaves you in
                  state of shock wondering how it could just jump from being a  scifi/ slice of life anime to an action riddled  anime in just one episode  and you start to realize and string together what happened it then  ends with you feeling satisfied  to what happened and reaching a whole new level of understanding of what subtle hints it showed you at the beginning and what effects it would have on later events",10

                Damn, what a time to be a live and watching anime. Especially one anime that many people hold much praise over for such a long time....And yet, it wasn't until this year when I decided to give it a watch. I'll try to be as simple as I can because I'm not like these people who look deeper in a show or whatever.
Story: 10/10
My god. What a ride! I went into this anime on guard. I had heard little parts like it being time travel and the end circles back. So, I had to pay attention to the early stuff. I found it interesting as
                  it incorporates an internet phenomena back in 2000 which I never really heard of, and adds it to the plot itself. The anime just incorporates a bit of everything. Suspense here, action there, some cute moments over everywhere. The show itself would give you clues to help you solve or connect people but it would still keep some items hidden until the end. So, throughout the show, I would be trying to remember key dialogue parts and be like ""Wait, this is who this person is"" or ""Thats how they are linked together"". But, there would be other moments where I was truly surprised at not expecting some of the outcomes. Probably the only real time stuff I had seen prior to Steins was like Erased, Re:Zero, and avengers Endgame. And little parts of each show seemed to be implemented within Steins but was done very well. Granted, Im sure those shows (minus Avengers) was most definitely inspired by Steins:Gate. The story was entertaining to see Okabe attempt time travel in the early stages of the show like any other curious scientist would. But, soon, antagonists appear and causes him to use the power of time travel to try to prevent his precious friends from getting hurt and learning more about them in the process.
Art: 10/10
I am no artistic person. I have no eye of art. This looked pretty well and looks better than some modern anime we see today. 
Sound: 10/10
Probably one of the greatest stuff in this anime. The OP/ED go really well in the show. However, as I watched the OP/EDs, I noticed the songs themselves were based either around time or targeted at specifically Steins;Gate or Okabe. When the songs lyrics are used to describe the character in this type of way, I find the music more enjoyable. And hearing Okabe's VA? I can understand why people may call him a God Tier VA. He brings Okabe to life and makes him very interesting. 
Character: 10/10
The whole story focuses on Okabe and the friends he encounters throughout the story. As time went on, I slowly began to find each person great and it was cool to see the issues each struggled with. The interactions between the characters were cute and funny. As time went on, I found Okabe as a character was epic. Especially as he slowly had to make the tough choices later on to ensure no one died. I liked seeing a hacker Otaku appear, especially using the internet slang. There were some characters where it we never saw a lot of their background but just enough of the important parts that made them like the MC for what he was. As someone had mentioned in a review, the only downside is the whole ""Reading Steiner"". They talk so much of Okabe having a fever at a young age and he presumed it must have been because of that, but we never really explore this unique power. It remains quite a mystery left unsolved or unexplored. But despite that, I can overlook that part.
Enjoyment: 10/10
I laughed. I grinned. I was mad. I was sad. This anime had me on the edge of my seat as I binged it during my 3 days. It was cool seeing their creative choices for the different parts of the show. I loved every episode whenever it appeared.
Overall: 10/10
My eyes have been open. For years, people have put this anime on a high pedestal. I never questioned it but was curious why it was so well liked. Now, I see. This anime is truly great and I loved every second. I have decided to give this a 10. This is the choice of Steins Gate.",10
"
                As much as i like this show, being that i've seen alot of anime so far in my time thus far, i do wanna point out that the more popular a series is, the more you think that, since people have hyped the show up to the maximum, that when going to watch said show, you have high expectations as well, hence the hype. Needless to say this show is very good, and very well written, but for any fanboy who's reading this, IT IS NOT PERFECT. So with that out of the way, let's get started.
story: 9/10
The story to Steins;Gate is pretty interesting, and
                  that's putting it lightly. The show more focus's on messing around in the first half, which in all honesty sets the tone for the start of the show very very very well. Seriously made it worth watching for the second half of the show which the show pulls a one eighty in tone, but it ties things together in a fairly reasonable fashion. however if i were to find fault for the show it most definietly the first half of the show. While it greatly makes up for this in the second half with one hell of an amazing thrilling story that makes you stay on the edge of your seat, the first half of the show took awhile to get through before it finally got to the great second half. in fact the first half really showed it almost being a slice of more than a time traveling thriller. But in the show's defense, i can't really picture the show going any other way, even though the first half is misleading, it does pace itself very well and gets you acquainted with the characters very well before leading into the best part of the show. See if you look at a show called Steins;Gate, the art for the show or even read the damn synopsis, you would imagine some seriously epic stuff, but the beginning really is pretty decieving, well except the first episode. After that it's misleading. 
art and animation: 7/10
This should be pretty quick, as there isn't much to be said here. Studio whitefox did a good job with look of the show, but that's about all. I mean attention to detail was very well done, but there's no moment's in the animation that are astounding other the top is amazing other than the time traveling moments and the opening which is done by Hanaka Itou called hacking the gate, which is amazing. In other words the animation may not be anything to impressive, but it's solid and get's the job done.
Sound: 7/10
Now the sound is another quick one, as the sound track isn't anything special it just compliments the show's scenes which in that regard it's good, but nothing stands out other than the previously mentioned opening. However for the sub vs dub debate, this is actually one i preferred subbed and highlight I have a dub preference. The dub is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, it just doesn't have as much needed flair as the sub had, and being that all but one character is japanese, it also helps.
Characters: 7/10
Now the characters is where the show isn't really the strong point of the show. The lead, Okabe Rintaro A.K.A hyoime kyoma (I know i didn't spell that right) is a amazing, and is well flushed out and you see that he truly is a loveable character, and has many ways and reasons for you to like him as he evolves throughout the show with his triumphs and errors. Kurisu is another character who is very enjoyable because while she does not have the same amount of interest as Okabe does, she is the only other character who is fun and enjoyable to watch, and her character development in the show was above the others other than the lead's role as well. The others however are really there just because they have to be. The standard perv otaku Itaru, the loveable/annoying mayuri who is a key person to the story, but that's all she is, and the rest are so boring that you couldn't care less about them unless there talking to Okabe. It's a shame because with such a  great story I expected more from the characters, but thankfully it didn't hurt the show too much, but is enough that you have to bring it up.
overall: 8/10
Overall the show is magnificent and should be watched, and is pretty well written, is it perfect? No, but is it worth watching? Yes, very much so. It has an entertaining plot and two leads that are fun to watch, but it has it's faults. Remember guys, just because it is ranked number two on MyAnimelist, doesn't mean it doesn't have problems.",8

                [NO SPOILERS]
Story 10 / 10
Steins;Gate starts of very confusing, but I can ensure you that this anime is a masterpiece. The whole story revolves around time travel, but in a way never shown before. The writers did a great job on making a story about time travel, done by so many, and make it their own. They made it into something new and refreshing. Someting that confuses you at first but when revealing its true self, it turns out to be an amazing ride full of friendship, romance and mystery!
The characters are very well developted througout the story, which is very impressive considering that it
                  would've been so easy to just focus on the time traval part, which would give enough material as it is.
Because of the amazing character development and their refreshing take on the time traveling genre, I give Steins;Gate's story a 10 out of 10
Art 8 / 10
Steins;Gate art is not regular anime art, that is for sure. Although I personally like regular anime art a lot more, Steins;Gate's art does fit the anime quite well. The anime wouldn't have been as dark and mysterious if normal anime art was used. A smart choice.
Sound 8 / 10
Steins;Gate's music was really good. The OST was very good and both the opening theme as the ending theme were astonishing.
Characters 9 / 10
Steins;Gate has a great cast of characters:
Okabe Rintarou: weird but heroic (and a mad scientist of course)
Makise Kurisu: stubborn but sweet
Shiina Mayuri: The nicest girl you'll ever meet
Hashida Itaru: Â§âÊÖãÔºÅ (PERVERT!)
and many more!
The characters are very well developed throughout the story. They will go through a lot of awful stuff together and you will definately bond with them.
Enjoyment 10 / 10
Steins;Gate has one amazing story line! The first episode will be really confusing, but please continue watching, because a great anime will reveal itself. Steins;Gate is one of the best anime I have ever watched and I doubt another anime will ever take its place. I hope this same thing will happen to you too ;)
Overall 10 / 10
Steins;Gate will be very confusing at first but a great plot line will reveal itself very shortly, don't worry! The art is different but suits the anime really well. Both the OST as the opening and ending theme were really good and the characters were simply amazing.
Overall I have enjoyed Steins;Gate more than I thought I would. If you haven't watched this masterpiece yet, than I implore you to do so as soon as possible because you are missing out on one of the best animes of all time.",10
"
                Now first of all, the series in itself is truly a masterpiece, no matter how deep you dig into it, everything is connected. So i was watching this episode that was deeply based on the IBM 5100, and went to youtube after, the first video on my recommended was about universal quantum computers, yet i haven't watched anything like it before, so i was interested, and to my surprise the first brand named of the quantum computers were IBM, now that striked me as a big coincidence, since i didn't know IBM was an actual manufacturer of computers, so i searched up the IBM 5100,
                  and wanted to know if there actually was such a programming language as there is in the anime...
So now, let me bend your ear for a minute.
There is a language like this, APL or a programming language (named after a book) was the rare language on this computer, now this is of course interesting but it gets so much better, the central datatype or the way its built up is called ""Multi-dimensional Array"" i kid you not, this is what i meant by everything in this anime being connected, this was thought through and i dont think a lot of people realised this. The whole anime is based upon the theory of a multi dimensional universe where the universe ""splits"" every time they alter something, the same way that theoretically the universe splits everytime you or i make a choice. 
I can't wait to watch the rest.",10
"
                This show is awesome. It is very entertaining and enjoyable. You will become very, very attached to the characters. It has an interesting concept on the theory of time travel but what really kept me interested was the dilemma the main character Okabe finds himself in.
Anyways enjoy it if you watch it, the animation is really good, and don't forget about the special episode after you finish the series.

                Steins;Gate was just an amazing anime that consisted of multiple different genres and subjects including the genres of romance, sci-fi, drama, a tad of action, and a little of mystery and you get this anime that does it all well.  Starting with talking about just how great the story was, well it was incredible.  The story is full of suspense just leaving you wanting to see the next because of how it keeps you hooked throughout the show.  The romance even though not being the main subject of the anime was very good, I actually found myself crying for about 20 minutes
                  on episode 22 (not saying why ;)  ).  In the show they usually devote one or two episodes for developing the different characters which really added to the personality and story behind the characters even if they weren't exactly the main characters.  The show was really intense which I know kept me just needed to see the next as this series will definitely hook you with the suspense the show leaves you with.  There was not to much action however the action that was there was perfectly done in my opinion.  I would recommend this to basically ANY anime fan but especially if you enjoy sci-fi or just an anime that never seems to lack in interest.  So yeah, I would overall give this show a 10/10.",10
"
                We've entered an endless recursion of time...wait, no, that was a different anime. Silly me.
Story:
It's a story about time travel. Big shock, I know. I enjoy time travel stories a lot, dunno why, maybe there's a deeper psychological reason for it that will one day be revealed after I killed a dozen people...a-anyway. While trime travel is always fun, it is very easy to step into plotholes as huge as a lunar crater. Steins;Gate evades this cleverly by adding something else in the mix: fate. I won't go into detail here, but even though I was looking for them, I could not find any significant
                  plotholes at all. I have witnessed dozens of time travel stories in any media, films, games, tv series, books, hell, even songs. But this one is the one that a) made the most sense and b) was the best written.
10/10
Art:
For some reason, S;G often felt like it had some sort of greyish filter over it, but I could not find any colors missing, so it may just be the overall setting of mostly taking place in a ""laboratory"" in a concrete city. However I did notice that the characters were looking a lot more normal than what other anime (even the serious ones) usually work with, the only exception being Christinas red hair and Feyris (though I'm still convinced that was a wig she just never took off). The realistic visuals worked well with the realistic approach of the subject (as far as that is possible). The visual effects were all really good and nothing in this anime felt out of place.
9/10
Sound:
It must be oviously me, since everybody else seems to disagree, but I didn't find the opening to be as amazing as often stated. It's good enough and the beginning is rather catchy, but I don't know, it just didn't set the mood for me. Electro-Pop just wasn't the right choice here. The ending worked better, especially when following up a plot twist. The background music was very fitting too, as were the sound effects. What was amazing indeed were the voices. Kana Hanazawa in top shape and an amazing job by the voices of Okabe, Kurisu and Suzuha as well as solid performances by everybody else.
9/10
Characters:
I never thought the day would come. I had lost all hope. But Steins;Gate did it. For the first time since School Rumble, I found a tsundere I liked (two actually if you think about it). Okabe, Kurisu, Mayushii (heart symbol) and Daru were a lot of fun to watch. I enjoyed their eccentricity, but I also liked seeing them get serious when the situation asked for it. Even though they weren't always right (hell, most times they were completely wrong), their conclusions and actions made sense to me. The side cast, while less important, was also properly characterized and enjoyable. For some reason I don't really understand, I especially took a liking to the part-time warrior. And have I mentioned that Mayuri is the cutest cutie pie to ever cute?
10/10
Enjoyment:
I think it's easiest to describe what I thought about Steins;Gate while watching in it four little steps:
1. Hm, this isn't bad, no idea why it's praised so much though.
2. Hey, that's actually pretty good, I'm beginning to really like this.
3. Wow, this is a great anime. I might even consider putting it in my favourites if this keeps up.
4. Wow...
Yes, I was very sceptical of all the praise this show gets and I indeed had expectations I was sure it could never meet. But damn, it did! And for that, I salute you, Steins;Gate.

                Steins;Gate
This show managed to make a time travel story not fall flat on its face.
This alone deserves an award.
The complete first half of the show is just character building.
This makes it so that we actually give a shit about what happens to them  ( looking at you , Chaos;Head)
The mystery is intriguing and the characters are all very defined and unique.
The show manages to create heavy emotional tension by handling it‚Äôs characters and character interaction very well.
The general dialogue is also godlike and completely steals the show.
The production quality is decent, the voice acting and music are definitely the best things about the overall
                  quality.
This show is a good example of how to make a great sci-fi mystery story.
It may have some tropes and the consistency of the time travel and technology may be a little wonky , but the amazing story and interesting characters more than make up for it.",9
"
                Steins;Gate is an astounding anime, quite frankly i don't like shows involving time travel, and its excruciatingly hard to make one revolving around it. But this anime so outstanding its rewatchability is too high to express in words. Both the subtitled and the dubbed are very good but i would have to say that overall the dubbed is better. Steins;Gate not only did well involving time travel it also did well as to adding references, they even pulled off a doctor who reference within it (for the record i do not watch doctor who and the reference they make is not obscure). The only problem
                  with it is when you try to recommend it to someone it's hard to explain it with out making it sound like a comedy anime. Because if you tell your friend that ""its an anime involving a few guys in an apartment accidentally turning the microwave into a time machine"" then they're going to expect something totally different. Steins;Gate mostly appealed to me because of the development of the characters if you watch you'll be able to see relationships and spot key points as to why characters are like the way they are and how their lives change when the past is altered. Overall i highly recommend Steins;Gate and assure you its completely worth watching, until then El Psy Kongroo.",10
"
                I don't have words to express my love for this Anime. Simply put, one of the best Animes to ever appear. I actually feel blessed to be able to watch this.
Each episode makes you yearn for more and more. About halfway through the series, the show takes a turn from its simple and slow style to a massively emotional and intellectual one. With near perfect pacing, amazing writing and direction, deep and involved characters and spectacular voices, this show is one you will remember for a long, long, long time. I would have given 15/10 stars if possible. El Psy Congroo.

"
                If you one a see a show that is smart with an amazing plot and awesome characters than get ready for a trip back in time with steins;gate
PLOT:The best part about this show is the actual story which revolves in the act of time traveling, this kind of stores are very hard to write becouse its very easy to confuse people. But steins;gate dose it so well that you almost belive in its time travel concept. Also the story dose well to mix up funny moment and serius moments and the ending of this show even if it wasn't spectacular it was done well.
CHARACTERS: the
                  characters in this show was also a high point in the series all were well davelope but i think the only thing was messing was some back story but all in all there were great and the show dose a great job of making you fell for them. My two favorites are the main character okabe ritaro or HOUNIN KYOMA becouse his very funny and smart and takes care of his friend also his one of the braves characters i know in anime and the second one is Daru or SUPER HACKER his a fat otaku who says the funnest lines in the show enough said.
Animation:The weakest part of this show has to be the animation not that its not good but it dosen't compear to the other parts of the show.
MUSIC: The music in steins;gate is great it has a lot of great tunes that pump you up about whats going to happend and there are songs that are calm and very good for the listeners to get them into the anime and both opening and ending were great
ENJOYMENT AND FINAL THOUGHTS: This is one of the rare animes this days that actualy are one of a kind and diffrent from the others and in a good way i enjoy it from the begining to the end with all its time travel theories and twist i can say that this anime is a masterpiece and should be watched buy everyone who likes a great anime with an outstanding plot and characters that would entertain you till the very end.",10

"
                I watched Steins;Gate. The I watched the movie. Then I immediately started watching the series again. What else is there to say? 
Characters: 11/10 
I love each and every one of the charcters in this show, and the interactions between them, especially in the first half of the series, is by far the best I've seen in Anime, and ranks higher even than most shows with live actors I saw. Remember that since I don't speak japanese, this statement is based only on the characters' tone of speaking, physical gestures and English subtitles. The charcters are just that good. 
In my opinion, a good (main)
                  character must have 3 things: Personailty, clear motives and a backstory. You may say that it's obvious, but actually in many shows, including so-called classics like Cowboy Bebop, the main charcters just lack these basic features. Here, on the other hand, is the complete opposite, and the distinguishable pesonalities of the charcters (most importantly, of course, Okabe's) allow the amazing interactions between them to happpen. 
Art and Sound: 9/10 
As someone who visited Tokyo for several days, I can say that the show depicts the feeling in Akihabara during the hot summer very accurately. The Maid Cafe in the show is much less crazy than in reality, though. 
Music has only a secondary importance in the show. The opening (song+art) is very good. 
Story: 9/10  
Basically, it's the type of story we've all seen numerous times before, but in fact there is so much more in Steins;Gate than in the typical time machine stories. Seemingly I can't write about the story without too many spoilers so I'll leave it that way. I'll just add that in my opinion the show could have been a little more emotional at certain parts. 
The bottom line: Steins;Gate absolutely deserves its place as one of the highest rated Anime ever.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is the second highest rated anime on all of MAL. As such, I went into it with extremely high expectations, which initially caused me to nitpick at little things that I disliked about it. However, looking back a month after finishing the series, I can say it more the most part deserves the praise that it gets. 10/10 doesn't mean it has no flaws, it just means the strengths of the show are powerful enough to make up for it.
Story: 10
Some people might find the first half of the show to be a bit slow, but it helps build suspense and explore the characters,
                  and leads to an explosive second half. The story is pretty self-consistent and respects the ability of the viewer to piece together the things that happen. The way the pieces of the story fall together is brilliant. If I had nitpick, I would probably complain about the *just anime things* that show up in the story (traps and maids and calling people perverts), but I guess it's fair since the story takes place in Akihabara and it doesn't detract from the overall story.
Art/Sound: 10
I don't really like rating art most of the time, because I don't really focus on it unless it's especially good or bad. Same for music. I give a 10 for both because I can't really think of how they could be better; the important scenes are drawn well and the OP is amazing.
Character: 10
This is where Steins;Gate TRULY shines. I love the main characters, how they're developed, have nuance, and talk with each other so naturally. I don't believe in waifus because the word usually means ""hot anime girl with a single defining character trait"" but Makise Kurisu is definitely my dream girl. I might be romanticizing how well the characters are actually developed but for some reason they left a bigger impression on me than any other anime I've watched.
Enjoyment/Overall: 10
The show is so fun, exciting, and satisfying to watch. And honestly, props to being one of the 3 anime in the last decade to wrap up as neatly as it did. I've had enough of all these series that go on and on without any thematic conclusion. Now I just need Attack on Titan to finish.",10
"
                Oh, the mighty god of anime, save my soul from the fandom who is likely to tear me apart for giving SUCH LOW score to SUCH BRILLIANT anime!
I've been seeing the hype about Steins;Gate going around the net for years now, and never got time to come around it. But, as the odds dictated, I've started watching Chaos;Head, and so inevitably ended up with Steins;Gate and Robotics;Notes. I won't even try to hide my disappointment. Knowing how critical the anime society is, and seeing such high score on MAL and generally reviews on the net, I expected to be swept off my feet. Needless to
                  say I was not.
Story: 6/10
Now, feel free to spit fire at me, but I did not like the story. I admit it was very well thought through and there isn't much I can complain of as no plot holes (Shira's #1 pet peeve) were left uncovered. My problem is that I didn't find it interesting. In fact, I ended up quite bored at times. I was starting to get somewhat interested only when Okabe processed in fixing his previous reckless actions, but then the part about a certain character's death had begun and I was starting to lose concentration once again. Although I'm not a fan of romance genre (duh, killing and violence is what this gentle 160cm girlie digs!), I did enjoy it a lot in Steins;Gate, and this fact definitely deserves a credit and a big pat on the back. And yet, I did not like the story. Sorry, angry fans.

Those who read my other reviews must know by now I'm a big fan of not-too-bright themes. In other words, I like soft colours that aren't too dark but don't rape my eyes either. Calmness and greyish accent is the key, wish I was better at using this in my fan arts. Nevertheless, I truly enjoyed the colours in Steins;Gate, probably more than in the other two animes of the trio. I loved how each character was given that little detail that made them stand out ---- can't help it, but the brightest of them was Mayuri's eyebrows. 
Sound: 7/10
There was definitely nothing significant about the sound. It blended in fine, I guess. Not that I paid attention...I was too busy trying to remain concentrated on the story as I kept on losing my focus. Again, I apologize, but it was boring. 
Characters: 8/10
Yasssss, the characters is what I liked! Ruka is a little sweetheart, omg. It's rare to see characters like this put into animes that aren't directed at 13-years-old yaoi fangirls, who will love any series as long as there are ""kawaii bishies kissing"". Also, you won't often see one of the main character being obese - usually those are supports, as the mains, stereotypically, are perfect looks wise. BUT WHAT KILLS THE SCORE IS MAYURI. I swear to god, it's one of the most bloody annoying characters in the world. Throughout the series I sorta wished she died. Horrible, horrible me.
Enjoyment: 6/10
Nah. I didn't enjoy it as much as the most seem to have had. Interesting concept, nice art, vivid character....And a boring story. I watch my animes while working out, therefore I need something to be truly astonishing and addictive, so I forget the physical pain and tiredness. Steins;Gate failed to provide me that, and I suffered every minute of my work out. So, as you can tell, I did not quite enjoy it. 
OVERALL: 7/10
The more reviews I write, the better I learn how unpopular my opinion is. In all honestly, I believe this anime is strongly overrated. While I can't deny it being truly good, with a decent and complete plot, alongside the variety of characters and unexpected twists, there are LOADS of better series out there that don't get even a half of attention Steins;Gate generated. Someone on the Internet once complained about ""the empty feeling after finishing Steins;Gate"", and that's when I got convinced it will really be one of the best animes. But I finished the series, and I feel nothing. I'm even somewhat glad I finished it. And that's definitely not what one feels upon completing the worthwhile series.
Now, fandom, feel free to crucify the non-believer me.",7

                When I first watched Steins;Gate I have to admit, I didn't really think much of it. When I finished it I thought to myself ""Well I guess I'm done with that anime"" and It took me a couple days to realize that this anime is one of the best show's I've ever seen. I am so drawn back to it, I am considering at the moment to re-watch it.
(May Contain Spoilers) 
Story: The thing I love about the story is that EVERYTHING CONNECTS. That minor detail in episode 4 will become the plot of the episode in episode 10. The first episode had the best
                  foreshadowing I've ever seen. The best part about it all is that everything he doe's serves a greater purpose down the road.
Art and Sound: The art did not stand out too much, for an Anime made in 2011, it could've had better animation.But thats a minor detail I'd deduct a half point from that. Also personally I enjoyed all the songs and any sound. The main character's voice was annoying at first but you get used to it quickly
Characters: This is where the anime takes a leap in a completely different direction from others. The main character who was annoying at first, changes dramatically from being an annoying protagonist to willing to sacrifice everything to save his friends. Oh and if you watched this show then (Minor spoiler warning)
""Too-too-roo"" to you. I found all the character's lovable there wasn't one character that I hated.
Enjoyment:  When I first watched this anime as said earlier I didn't think much of it. But when I rewatched the show (Thats right If I rewatch it again it would be my third time) I fell in love with the show. Steins;Gate is a masterpiece and it deserves all the hype it has gotten. I look forward to the new series/season 
Thanks for reading",10

                It's not often that i feel inclined to mark a show so highly and part of it is the sheer originality of it. By which i mean the characters feel like genuine people (despite their various eccentricities); they don't feel like cookie cutter tropes and the show comes off as a real piece of art thanks to it.
The show starts off remarkably slow and it's not until episode 5 that you get any real sense of context to the story, like jumping into a pool not realising how deep it is and then making your way to the shallow end trying to find a spot
                  you can finally put your feet down. This, were it not for the shows own reputation as something of a cult classic could be a killer for a lot of people (potential fans) who run the ""3 episode policy"" on whether or not to continue with a show. If you stick with the show, you are pleasantly rewarded with an absolute gem.
For a comparison, the show reminded me a lot of a much more recent release i happened to see prior to this, titled Re:Zero, which runs a similar concept to a time loop or ""reset"" function/ability gimmick that features in these shows. Not just because of the concept itself, but also the direction the narrative takes with it. One which starts off incredibly light hearted, before taking a more philosophical and deep meaning route, becoming much more dark and intense towards the end before tying up all the lose ends with a neat and tidy ending. Needless to say the story is a real roller-coaster ride in which you can really empathise with the MC's emotional suffering. Ordinarily this is not my first choice of story genre as i'm not partial to this sort of drama because it's a real emotional investment i don't always have the energy for, but that's not to say i cannot appreciate the stories obvious quality in the face of my personal bias. Needless to say i still really enjoyed it from start to finish.
There's not too much else to be said without spoiling anything significant, naturally with a time travel-esque gimmick there are multiple twists in the plot (Anyone who's seen Charlotte, another show that features a reset ability, knows what i'm talking about) and my main piece of advice is if you wind up streaming this show off a site with a comment section is do not read through the comments until afterwards because it can be easily spoiled from around episode 8 where the show reaches its full pace.",10

                First year university student Rintarou Okabe is a self-proclaimed ""mad scientist"" who conducts experiments in a small apartment in Akihabara with his bizarre group of friends using home appliances. However, when the microwave he is experimenting on is somehow turned into a time machine, the life of Rintarou Okabe takes a darker turn.
That is pretty much a rough synopsis of Steins;Gate, one of the most hyped and well-received anime of the 2010's. It is a complex and entertaining sci-fi thriller, with a realistic and scientific depiction of time travel, and with a rich cast of well-developed character. Or is it?
Steins;Gate fails to be what I
                  have described above, although it tries to. Although the story is presented with dull colors and an atmosphere of mystery, everything falls apart due to pandering. Steins;Gate panders so much to the otaku audience that it is too hard to take it seriously. All the characters are caricatures, especially the female ones. You have a tsundere, an airheaded cosplayer, a moe maid, and even a ladyboy. And that's what hinders the plot.
The story of Steins;Gate could have been good if it was kept purely a time travel thriller. However, plot integrity is sacrificed to display the wide array of female characters, and have Okabe go on ""dates"" with most of them. At some point, the anime becomes somewhat of a dating sim, and the time travel becomes a tool to have him date all the girls. Apart from this, the plot also many inconsistencies, which I'll mention below.
*THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CONTAIN SPOILERS*
First and foremost, I want to say that the entire plot of Steins;Gate comes from Okabe's idiocy. He manages to create a time travel device that can send e-mails to the past, and for some reason, it seems a good idea to him to let every person in his clique use it, including here people he barely knows. The whole plot afterwards includes Okabe undoing these actions, which would not have happened had he been smarter.
Secondly, since the entire plot is about ""undoing"", there is hardly any development to the story or the characters. Whenever something important happens, it can be simply reversed or undone. In the end, the finale of the anime becomes the beginning, making the whole story pointless. None of the events which we have seen has actually happened, and in the end, nothing's changed. Pointless.
Another problem I had with the anime is the ability called Reading Steiner, which is a very important element in the story. For some reason, Okabe conveniently retains his memory whenever he jumps from one timeline to the other, although nobody else does. How come? We never really get an explanation for this, making this ability a deus ex machina, which is a sign of bad writing.
*END OF SPOILERS*
So, to conclude, Steins;Gate has a lot of shortcomings, and doesn't deserve the hype and the praise it gets. However, it still remains an entertaining piece of fiction, whose strong point is mainly the dialogue. I especially enjoyed the banter between Okabe and Kurisu, for example. Furthermore, despite all the plot holes and convenient plot devices, it still has an interesting usage of time travel, although it fails to utilize it perfectly.",6
"
                No matter how you experience it, whether through the Anime or the original VN. Steins;Gate is a masterpiece. A deeply moving adventure that captured my imagination, pulled at my heartstrings and has brought so much joy into my life.
For a time travel story. It's one of the best ever written. Whilst slow and a bit confusing at the start. It does pick up. Once it does, it becomes a thrilling and fascinating ride that'll have you hooked. The genius thing about Steins;Gate is how the deeply complex plot unravels as you watch it. The writing and execution are flawless. It's especially good at establishing the
                  universe's rules and sticking with them. 
Steins;Gate is heavily driven by the characters. And thankfully, they are all fantastic. Each one has their own quirks and charms, making them all very likable. Okabe is eccentric and funny. Kurisu is intelligent and an obvious tsundere. Daru is a perverted otaku and Mayuri is so sweet and innocent. Their interactions are great and feel so genuine with one and other. They're like one big goofy family and you really learn to care for them.
The side-characters are also really great. Each one has an emotional arc that makes them just as important to not only the protagonist but to the central plot of the main story. They're his driving force though-out. 
Speaking of. I don't think I've seen a more compelling protagonist than Okabe Rintarou. Throughout the story, you experience his highs and most absolute lows. You watch him change. And you feel for him. In fact, I have never empathized with a character as much as him. Sure, he's a melodramatic nutjob and a self-proclaimed mad scientist. But he's a really caring... self-proclaimed mad scientist. That loves his friends above all else. And he's the main reason why the story is as good as it is.
Steins;Gate is the best Anime I've watched. It's an unforgettable experience that will forever be etched into my heart.

                This is a spoiler free review. Overall score: 9/10.
Story (8/10):
The show's premise is about time travelings, even when writing about this topic is as difficult as it is, the show manages to present concepts and theories that could be taken as ""logical"" which has a big merit to it. It is more understandable after a second watch. The dialogue of the series is pseudo-cientific and ""complex"", rough and not very confortable to stand throu. This is definetly a series that is not suitable to be marathoned.
Art (9/10):
Since the source is a graphic novel the character designs are pretty detailed and over all, studio White Fox
                  did a nice job giving the series a sort of tension and coldness to the environment with clever use of color and simple yet detailed animation.
Sound (7/10):
Excelent opening and an outstanding voice acting. Unfortunately the show's soundtrack in pretty forgettable.
Characters (10/10):
Almost all the characters present themselves as a trope. Is this bad? No, because the show is enoughly well written to give them personalities to make them surpass a generic ""red headed tsundere"" or a ""cosplayer bishoujo"" and makes you actually care about them at the point that you would care for a real person. The well written characters combined with all star voice actors and actresses are the best aspect of the show.
Enjoyment (9/10):
If you are a man of science (just like me) you will enjoy how the series presents all its cientific concepts, but if you do not stand a nice piece of dialog it is not recommended for you to watch it. Marathon this series, even if you like the concept of time traveling or a good piece of dialoge this is very like to bore you anyways.
If you have any comment or sugestion you can tell me via twitter (@KuralevOtaco) in English or Spanish, thank you for reading.",9

                This is anime is tied for my favorite of all time. I love it. Everything about this anime is just solid. There is a reason why it is always one of the top anime on here. I'm normally into action/sci fi anime, but this being different still hit the spot perfectly. It's such a mix of everything, that it's hard to not find something you will enjoy. It's funny, it's thrilling, it's mysterious, it's chilling, and is one of the most memorable anime I have ever seen. I cannot recommend this anime enough, it's fantastic, watch it whenever you get the chance. 
Story (10 Perfect)
I'm
                  usually one to nitpick about certain things and whatnot, but honestly there isn't in anything in the story that I didn't like or was even annoyed about. People say the first few episodes are boring, and I completely disagree. The fist few episodes create the world and start the mystery, it hooked me from the very beginning. What people are correct about though, is the fact the anime picks up after a few episodes. After those few episodes, things don't hesitate, they pick up almost instantly.  Major events occur and they will leave you speechless. The story becomes thrilling, and when every episode ended, it left me wanting more, to continue on, to see the events through to the end. The events leading to the ending are fantastic, and the ending itself is good.
Animation (10 Perfect)
The animation was fluid, beautiful, and flawless, in my opinion. The character designs, the setting, the atmosphere were all well created. There are certain instances where they show a lot of sun and glare, and others where it is a bit dark and bland, which I believe add to the mood and scene.
Sound (10 Perfect)
The character's voices are again perfect, in my opinion. None of them sound dull, annoying, or boring in anyway. The background noise of cicadas are present through most of, if not all episodes, which adds to the atmosphere. The soundtrack, intro. and outro were great as well.
Characters (10 Perfect)
The characters are another reason why this show is fantastic. Every one of them is enjoyable and relatable. The feeling the characters show is part of what drives the anime. They're funny, witty, sarcastic, serious, and show genuine emotion. Besides Mayuri is one of my favorite characters in any anime, not sure why.
Overall (10 Perfect; Must See)
To sum it all up, this tied for my favorite, I love it. It's funny, thrilling, emotional, and all of the above. It's a beautifully made show that has some very intense moments and does not drag on. The characters are awesome and very enjoyable. The show is a must watch in my opinion, it's fantastic!",10
"
                Normally I tend to stay away from overly heavy plots. Not because I hate them, but because at the end of the day I'm trying to learn more about the characters and appreciating their complexity and many times the plot can distract me from enjoying the development of its characters. Steins; Gate is an example of one of my exceptions, as it does both its plot and its characters right and gives them both, in my opinion, a good amount of focus. 
Time travel stories are very hit or miss as they are a gamble. They have the most potential as stories than many other
                  fantasy/scifi stories but can also end up with so many inconsistencies and plot holes that can sink the entire thing. I am happy to say that this show delivers its ideas of time travel very well and everything is explained in a way that makes it sound incredibly plausible. But the real treat is seeing how time travel can affect everyone's lives in different ways and how this show tackles the morality of changing something in the past. And no, nothing is perfect, even when you change the past to make it so and there is always something you will have to give up in the process. I've seen countless time travel stories where it seems that there is no consequence to traveling and the only way to solve the problem is by abusing time travel to the point everything straightens out. While time travel does get abused by the characters, it's at their own expense as something unfortunate almost always happens afterwords. This dilemma is handled by the show so maturely that this is probably my favorite time travel story of all time. 
The art and sound are very good and do their job nicely. They're not amazing by any means, but they don't interfere with the enjoyment of the story and characters.
The characters are done so well here that I do enjoy all of them. Specifically, I think Okabe, Kurisu, Itaru, Mayuri, and Suzuha all get the perfect amount of time in the spotlight and they are the ones that are the most well developed. My only complaint about this show is that the other three lab members don't really get that much attention put on them which is really sad because I would have liked to know more about them, especially Moeka who honestly was probably the most complex character with all this mystery surrounding her. That's not to say any of them were done poorly however, I just really wanted to see more of them. I'm grateful for what I got.
At the end of the day Steins; Gate is an intelligent anime that just does everything right. I sat through all 24 episodes in one go because I was on the edge of my seat. I should warn those wacthing this for the first time will notice that the show starts off slow but I promise it gets better. I was really interested between episodes 4 and 5 and eventually hooked between episodes 8 and 9. I love this anime and it is a fine contestant to be my favorite and it is my hope many more people watch this one because it's not an anime you want to miss.",10

                Oh, Steins;Gate.
I've put this review off for a long time because i believe the stakes are high and for the longest time i've feared whether my choice of words could ever truly do this anime justice. At this stage i no longer care so i'll be as blunt as possible. 
Steins;Gate was the most disappointing anime i've ever watched. 5/10.
(9.2/10 MyAnimeList? HAHA! Really... )
SCIENCE!
If you're not entirely distracted or left behind by the main character's mad antics you'll begin to realize that this anime isn't at all about science. The main may wear a lab-suit, he may talk like a genius, the mains' may use
                  real scientific theories but it pains me to assure you this anime is largely 'Drama'. I'd credit most of my disappointment to the half-wits who recommended this anime for it's ""interesting scifi."" Anyone with an average attention span will see that science may be the theme of this anime but it's by no means interesting or even present most the time. What you should consider. 
1. The scientific premise - the very plot itself - for this anime makes it very clear in the beginning that conventional theoretical physics is largely wrong. What this allows is the introduction of their alternate theory. This was acceptable to me (seeing as though it is sci-fi[ction]) however what's hilariously disappointing is that mid-way throught he anime they actually USE the conventional theories they called stupid and they don't even make a hassle of it. This has to be a plot hole but either event it's contradictory to the whole 'genius' of the main.
2. Once they establish the 'science' that's the last you really hear of it. There's minor twists and realizations but overall there's little science air time.  
3. The theme of science is so desperately forced in the worst times. The little romance that exists in Steins;Gate is ruined by the stupidest romance scene i've likely ever seen. Of course, this is only my opinion but when that romantic tension accumulates to a love-scene where when the nameless characters are giving their affection ... they do not express happiness, love, joy or adoration ... no no no. They take the opportunity to quote Einsteins Theory of Relativity. I had to laugh. 
This anime is the classic case of an Anime that is self-sabotaging. The science in its entirety could probably take up less than 10 minutes. What we remain with is 8 hours worth of stretched out Drama. I'm not saying this is good or bad, just know what you're getting into. It's certainly not my preference to sit through a six hour development where little changes until finally we're rewarded with the ending. 
I'll happily give credit where it's due. The two mains are highly interesting. They are the sole reason why i've soldiered on but this sadly is short lived through the excruciating pacing where their appeal is stretched out and only appears at the rare occasion. 
In short ... this would had made a half-decent film (i haven't watched the film), but stretched out ... it takes hours to develop plot points and once you throw together bright animation (sun) with Cicada chimes every episode you begin to go mad. My own personal indication of a an anime's worth only surfaces in the most extreme cases of happiness or boredom. An extremely good anime will wake you up and have you desperately clicking for the next episode however a bad anime (this one) will give you headache, doubt whether the next episode is worth it or you may just 'drop' it entirely.
For the record it took me 3 attempts over 4 years to finish this anime. 
First attempt = episode 5.
Second attempt = episode 16.
Last attempt = 24. 
 My final attempt was just as insufferable but i was determined to finish it once and for all - in hopes of never returning. I've watched 45 episodes altogether of Steins;Gate and i regret every single one.

                Steins;Gate is really a thrilling and very good anime in terms of the story, it makes sense in all the way from the beginning up to the end. The story makes a twist that you will not realized how things happened. It combines comedy and mysteries that you could possibly think what will be next to happen. 
Even though there will be a redundancy of the episode but it will enjoyable that this redundancy is not a waste of time.
Enjoyment of this anime is really great that you could not sleep until you finished the episode, due to its mysteries covered from the story up
                  to the romance and comedies of the characters
I rated the overall rating to 10 because this kind of anime is really outstanding in terms of the story, character and enjoyment while watching this anime.
So I recommend this anime for watchers who wants mysteries combinations of comedy, romance and sci-fi, and I'm sure your time will not be wasted in this kind of anime.",10
"
                <The Review itself should be spoiler-free. Mild spoilers are included in footnotes at the bottom.>
It's difficult to give Steins;Gate a single score. On the one hand, some of the humor is top-notch and the construction of the overall story leads to occasional moments of clarity which beat anything else I've ever seen before. On the other hand, the character interactions are usually wooden, the pacing is usually bad, and the majority of the show is a painful slog of poorly written exposition to fill in between the good stuff.
My biggest problem has to do with the way the plot is driven forward. It seems like
                  in most of the time travel animes I've watched so far (of which there are at this point admittedly few), things only happen because characters able to time travel suddenly become idiots with no ability to communicate when they realize their power. This is what ruined the ending of Charlotte for me. This made some of Erased difficult to watch. Steins;Gate manages to outdo both of those, and not in a good way. (At this point it should be noted that I have a hard time suspending disbelief, especially when it comes to inconsistent characterizations. Immersion-breaking flaws of this sort made Deathnote near-unwatchable for me. If you don't mind unrealistic characters or lazy writing, this may not be an issue.) [1]
Plenty more things I would have liked improved as well, mostly explanations for seemingly random events like memory across world lines and Reading Steiner as well as the real rules for parallel universes (never explained entirely), but it's fine for these things to be overlooked in an anime with limited runtime. 
Shame these missing plot elements couldn't be turned into a strength like in Angel Beats!, but Steins;Gate is a story that falls apart under closer scrutiny where Angel Beats! becomes better with careful dissection of its uncannily self-consistent omissions. Shame, because the concept really is excellent. At times the anime has moments when that concept breaks through the filler, producing some incredible moments [2]. The problem is that these moments are too rare and fleeting, not worth the chore of watching the buildup for. 
<Sigh>
The art is decent. No high level of detail, but easily good enough for the story. If anything the flat colors and gradients are an Apple-esque design choice: not something I like personally, but when done well it can unify everything nicely. Steins;Gate succeeds here. The reliance on easy-to-animate panning shots over stationary objects and stationary scenes with only moving mouths feels lazy, but the argument can be made that it was an attempt to convey the VN aesthetic. The concentric circle approach to eyes is an interesting one. I don't think it worked too well with the rest of the aesthetic (it made some characters' faces look cluttered because the rest of the art consists only of clean lines and gradients), but it would be an interesting approach in another anime.
The soundtrack (what little of it there is outside of near-inaudible background tracks) is okay. The lack of it through most of the anime is an artistic choice I'm fine with. When the soundtrack is present, though, it's usually forgettable. One bit that stuck out was ""Christina II"", which opens with bells and light piano then transitions smoothly into a simple syncopated waltz with strings and a bass guitar. As a complement to Kurisu's character progression it's a masterpiece (contrast it with ""Christina I"", which is a similar but more complex piano piece without the syncopation and played very deliberately). If there were more examples of melodies like this being altered to convey something words and images can't, this could have been a great soundtrack (see John Powell's score for HTTYD2 as a reference for repeated motifs defining character development ‚Äì ""Christina"" is reminiscent of this). As is, it's yet another example of where Steins;Gate brushes near-perfection, making the rest of its mediocrity that much harder to bear. 
I don't know how to tackle the next bit, so I'm simply going to lump all the humor, references, and other fluff into one big pile and label it fan service. Fan service doesn't have to be bad (see Haruhi Suzumiya or Konosuba). In Steins;Gate it's more of a mixed bag. Sure, it panders to otaku culture quite a bit, but it usually does so in ways that make sense given the story. The problem is that it often supersedes the story and becomes an end of its own. Had it been a facet of Daru's personality, it would have been excellent, but instead he becomes defined by his sex jokes. Had it been a facet of Faris, it would have been excellent, but instead the show focuses too much on her being or not being moe rather than exploring more important things.[3] Rukako's struggles with identity could have been emotionally powerful but were put aside in favor of making him/her a vehicle for fanservice (groping, cosplaying, awkward boyfriend/girlfriend... we seriously see none of Rukako's personality, only the projections of others). Honestly, most of the relationships in the anime eventually break down into traditional harem tropes instead of developing naturally like real people becoming increasingly concerned for one anothers' wellbeing.
That's not to say it's all bad. The humor definitely works, even though some jokes get repeated a bit too much (I get it, banana is a euphemism. Please stop.) It's best when they're allowed to sink into the background and appear as the plot allows ‚Äì the later scenes involving bananas and Dr. Pepper are great. Daru dispenses some memorable one-liners on occasion. The username joke with Suzuha is perfectly timed and delivered.
Every aspect of Steins;Gate suffers from this bimodality which accordingly makes all of it difficult to assign a score to. The overall concept is great. At its best, the writing is a 10; at its worst (mostly around the middle) I've struggled to not drop the show. The art is lacking in many ways, but the argument that they were valid design choices which merely happened to correspond with what would normally be called lazy animation can't be entirely discounted. The voice acting is good, but the soundtrack and mastering for the most part are unremarkable. Characters at times approach greatness but are for the most part held back by poor writing and fanservice. Some parts are supremely enjoyable while others are painfully tedious to watch. The overall result is mediocrity ‚Äì a shame because the potential for excellence is so palpable.
Footnotes, contains mild and intentionally vague spoilers
[1] There are plenty of other things that make no sense. Kurisu is a neuroscience major but just happens to design a working time machine on her own (her paper sparks the time machine arms race) and is some sort of physics god? Her banter with Okabe on exotic matter and Kerr black holes is accurate, but the remainder of the show is complete technobabble ‚Äì Kurisu's scientific genius persona stops being believable when she stops using real science (the data compression using a particle accelerator is particularly dumb). Also, how are both Okabe and Kurisu familiar with an obscure Old Icelandic poem (Fj√∂lsvinnsm√°l) while Okabe can't speak English? Why doesn't Kurisu do the time leaps instead of Okabe since Okabe has Reading Steiner? Why is Rukako willing to believe Okabe's story about worldlines when s/he has the least evidence of its truth? Why does Kurisu die almost instantly when stabbed while Okabe can endure so much worse but be completely okay? 
The only reason most of the episodes exist is because Okabe is incapable of telling anyone anything important. Endless Eight was more entertaining than some of the time loops in Steins;Gate; Unlike Kyon, Okabe retains his memory yet still manages to repeat the exact same mistakes without fail. The argument could be made that similar worldlines are predestined to have similar events, but if the goal was to convey helplessness the way Doki Doki Literature Club so masterfully does, Okabe's actions should be logical. DDLC's power comes from its making the main character try so hard and do so many things that feel like they should solve the problem ‚Äì by contrast, nothing Okabe does helps convey his anguish because nothing he does should have been expected to fix his problems, even in a world where he did have that power and the world lines didn't converge. 
After the first message gets sent it's clear that he needs to start collecting proof of the events in other world lines every time he makes a change. Despite using time travel some hundreds of times, he only uses this once, with the comment on Kurisu's cutlery. The ending didn't have to be the way it was if he had asked Kurisu what to tell her next time they met. Sure, the recall thing worked out with Faris, but he never did anything to make sure she would retain her memories when switching world lines in the other direction ‚Äì and he sure as hell didn't plan it that way initially. He tries to convince Moeka without any proof of the outcome in the other world lines. Ditto with Ruka, Mayuri, Suzuha... he has so many opportunities to get help but is either too stupid to realize it or too obstinate in floundering alone, neither of which sit well with his character development in the first half. 
[2] Especially reversing Faris's message and trying to save Kurisu the last time. 
[3] Like Faris's actual relationship with her father, which would have made the catharsis of revising the timeline that much more powerful. The moment when Okabe runs to the apartment to make sure Kurisu is okay could have also been incredibly heartwarming but was instead turned into an opportunity for more fanservice.
Some final comments that didn't fit in with the rest of the review:
I see some people bashing Mayushii. To the contrary, Mayushii is almost a great character. Where Okabe's time loops fail to convey heart-wrenching helplessness the way they should have, Steins;Gate gets close to expressing this through Mayushii's internal struggle towards the end. Mayushii knows Okabe's emotional vulnerability better than anyone else and is the character best able to see through his tough ""mad scientist"" facade ‚Äì this should be apparent through the half-real hostage story they live out. She sees his anguish and wants to reciprocate his kindness ‚Äì after all, that's why she's been staying in the lab up to this point ‚Äì but has no way of doing so. This makes the dramatic irony of Mayushii trying to save Okabe so poignant: she thinks she's had the opportunity to finally repay the debt. A bit more exploration of her past and reasons for staying with the lab would have made these scenes more than the sidenotes they ended up being.
Braun's dilemma is another example of this. With a bit more introspection his arc could have been powerful; instead, the anime opts to gloss over his fears for Nae's future and instead finds a way to sideline him for the rest of the story. Why does he do what he does? We know that Braun isn't heartless; to the contrary, he's sensitive and conflicted. That choice contradicts everything his character has stood for up to this point.
The first episode was a slog. Expecting it to be one of those things that can only be appreciated after finishing the anime, I tried rewatching it. Nope. It's still a bad episode, even if I get the references. ""The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina"" pulled it off much better; the difference is that that episode stood strong on its own even without any of the characters having been introduced or any of the references making sense while ""Prologue""'s only attraction would seem to be its references. Come to think of it, Steins;Gate borrows a lot of elements from Haruhi Suzumiya. For the most part, Haruhi did it better.",5

                I am an anime fan that only enjoys watching isekai. Safe to say, Steins;Gate is my favorite isekai of all time. The concept of Okabae transporting between different worldlines and in turn worlds is a perfect example of isekai. Unfortunately, some people refuse to accept this verdict. For example, a ""person"" called Ajax said ""Steins;Gate is not an isekai, it is not you idiot"". Safe to say, only fools with an IQ of 2 would come to such a conclusion as that of Ajax. People like of a higher intelligence would obviously come to the conclusion that Steins;Gate is a token isekai. Other than that,
                  the story is spectacular and best girl is clearly Ruka. That is all.",10
"
                I highly recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys unexpected twists, alternate realities, time travel, dimensional travel, genuine friendship, heartache, and moments of intense disillusionment. 
There's a certain part in the Steins;Gate series that I can't stop thinking about. Without spoiling it, it's about Okabe finally realizing the gravity of the situation he has found himself in. There's a point when you realize it's no longer fun and games. And for some reason, that was deeply satisfying to watch. They build up this character, this ego, these relationships and then you see it all come to the fore in a climactic moment. 
The way that
                  the directors and artists portrayed Okabe's disillusionment was just brilliant. You could almost watch it without any sound and still understand--through symbols and imagery--what's going on. 
(SPOILER ALERT)
A specific example: There's a shot of a clock with the shadow of a train violently, rapidly speeding across it. For those that have seen the series they might understand what it means. I interpreted as representing the hundreds of times Okabe had to see his friend die. That whole bit was just amazing to me. By him going through one of the most painful things someone can go through when they care about somebody, watching her die, in the hopes of saving her, that's amazing.",10

                Steins;Gate is (at the moment of writing this review) the highest rated Sci-Fi anime on MAL, as well as the 4th highest rated anime in general. It's often considered as a masterpiece by many mainstream reviewers and casual watchers. However, as you may have guessed because of the overall score I gave to this show, I have a different opinion than the majority.
I'll start naming the positive aspects I find on this show, but don't expect me to explain myself too much because I'm trying to make this review as short as possible.
1. The directing is great, as expected from the director of Texhnolyze.
2. The
                  art and animation are pretty good. OK, I'm not really a fan of the character designs, and at times the colors are so dark that you can barely see anything, but at least I can say the character designs of the show are easily recognizable, even iconic, and the animation is consistently good most of the time.
3. The music is good, not particularly memorable (except for the OP and ED), but it fits with the tone of the series.
4. Some of the concepts are interesting. Despite thinking that a good time travel story with a serius tone is something extremely hard to do right because of how complex it would be to handle the implications of time travel in a realistic way, I can still give Steins;Gate some credit for at least trying.
5. Okabe and Kurisu are both good characters with interesting character interactions and a gradual development through the series
Unfortunately, those are all the good things I can say about it, now I'll start with the negative aspects that make me consider this work as a mediocre one.
1. The characters. To make things short, there are two types of character in this anime; the archetypes with no real personality and the main couple (Kurisu and Okabe). Yeah, I know that most of the characters from the first group are a bit fleshed out through the story, but they don't actually have a proper development or even a characterization outside of their respective achetypes and end up feeling more like jokes than characters
Compared to Evangelion, that's a huge downgrade.
2. The story constantly ruins its own progress, over and over again. Remember what I said about the minor characters not having a proper development? Well, that's because every time the story gives one of its characters a chance to develop and eventually reach a catharsis, all of that is screwed up because the main character will just go back in time and undo everything. In other words, the very premise of the series prevents the secondary characters from having a proper development, and that keeps happening until the very end, making the entire series feel like it was all about 2-3 characters.
3. The stupid logic of the show. Since the anime is so praised as an intellectual masterpiece, one would at least expect some kind of logic despite the anime literally starting with a bunch of antisocials discovering time travel by putting bananas on a microwave; and that's the problem, Steins;Gate has a complete lack of logic. The butterfly effect in this series works as the author wants it to work, and that's why this show is so full of plot holes and convenient situations.
I would mention an example of this, but it would be a spoiler. For those who have watched the show, do you remember the whole vegetables thing? That's what I'm talking about.
In conclusion, Steins;Gate has interesting concepts, but it fails to present them properly, falling into pretentiousness and mediocrity.",4

                ""El. Psy. Congroo."" 
Well to say it simply, This time travelling emotional rollercoaster of an anime doesn't fail in captivating your mind and body. It was such an amazing experience. 
Everything from the amazing storyline to the relationships that develop and the emotions that are portrayed in such an amazing fashion. To be fairly honest I wasn't expecting much of out of this anime and the first few episodes didn't do much to change that, but you know you're wrong when you finish an anime and have a huge gap in your life. Steins;Gate tugs on every one of your heartstrings whilst still being an
                  intellectual and amazingly well done piece of art. Emotions, Plot, Characters, Relationships are all portrayed in such a way that its quite difficult to describe.
One of if not my favorite anime,10/10 for  a Brilliant Plot, Amazing Characters[Who can hate Okabe, Mayuri and of course Kurisu ] and amazing direction.
Go for this amazing ride without a slight hint of a doubt in your mind, you wont regret it.",10

                Don't you just love a good ending! Welcome one and all to another Waldy565 review, and today (or tonight/early morning) we take a look at the mind, and time, -bending show with a seamingly inappropriate semi-colon, Steins; Gate.
As much as the show is about time travel, it's about the growth of the characters. Namely:- Okabe, our mad scientist, who actually does have some credibility as a scientist, Makise (or Christina because it's what Okabe calls her and it's easier), Amane, Miyuri, Hashida and Kiry√∫. Okabe is our main character, and believes a group called 'The Organization' is keeping tabs on him and his experiments with
                  time travel. His two friends to start, Miyuri and Hashida, play along with this. To avoid spoilers, Miyuri simply has a history with Okabe and from what I remember Okabe and Hashida are old school friends. 
This changes when Okabe and Miyuri meet Christina, who is neurologist and physicist ever since being interested in her fathers endevours into time travel. This is an important part of the plot, Christina and her fathers relationship, which gets fully explored. Anyway, as Christina has this background, this is where the proper experiments take place. To sum it up and to avoid any more spoilers, Okabe hops through time, altering universes, and eventually comes to a point where the fate of the world rests on him, twice, and he has to undo all his time hops to resolve this problem.  The two I haven't mentioned is Amane and Kiyr√∫. I don't know how others will feel but I really didn't like Kiyr√∫. Everyone will hate her at a certain point (trying really hard to not go into spoiler territory) but I hated her from the beginning, and she supposed to have a social phobia, as do I, but I only felt sympathetic towards her once! Amane I really can't mention without spoilers, but you'll see why she's important.
Despite the topic, very little knowledge is needed to enjoy the plot. As stated, it's as much about the characters as it is the story, and if you're interested in the time travel aspect (which isn't really explored, it's just used to keep the plot going and to avoid contradictions) a basic knowledge of physics will be needed, along with maybe and understanding of the grandfather paradox and multi-world thepry. My friends have always been interested in these topics, and to be honest they are sci-fi staples. And this is what I like - the studio has took a difficult subject and made it totally open by not bogging us down with theories and lingo! Marvelous.
Art, now I think about it, works well. Literally because it's some normal(ish) people dealing with something that is beyond their control, and the art is very neutral, which helps to convey this notion. Sound, however, takes a hit from everything else being brilliant. It's almost none-existant, except the sound effects and some soundtracks. 
And to conclude, this show is going to leave a legacy like cult movies. Indeed, Okabe and crew sprout some amazing lines. Many reviews I've read quote something and this is what you're supposed to take from the show, and to well and truly sign off, I'll add mine.
""Keep the past, for all intents and purposes, where it is"" - Okabe.",9

                So Steins Gate, I finally took the time to watch this, I was waiting to watch this for a long long while.  I'm definitely glad I did! So let's start.
Story: Now obviously you've got the synopsis you don't need me telling you, but the story is really good. You could compare this to Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi, or a movie I watched called Project Almanac. In that sense, I could think eh, this is another time traveling thing, but Stein's Gate blows them away easily, with its story. Sure, Project Almanac does have the same concept of changing time like Stein's Gate, but
                  the story of Stein's Gate, it goes way more in-depth with the characters and the time concept, so at the end of the anime, you understand how this was caused. This bumps it up way above the other two I watched. For Story 10/10
Art: I really am not the person to critique for art, because I don't really know how to do it. But I guess I can say I really liked the art style, of this anime. 
Art 10/10.
Sound: The soundtrack of this anime, I love it so goddamn much. The opening is so great!!! The sounds throughout the anime when setting a tone were perfect. At the moments, the music needed to create tension, to create a sense of happiness or just anything in general it worked! Sound 10/10
Character: This also another thing which makes it way above any other anime or the time traveling anime/movies I mentioned earlier. The attention to detail with the characters is on point. Okabe Rintarou as the Mad Scientist, Hashida Itaru ""Daru"" as the Super Hacker/Pervert, Mayuri Shiina as the airhead and lastly Makise Kurisu, the tsundere red-headed genius. These characters are so unique, but just work so well together! The supporting characters are really good as well! Each the character's past are shown (some more than others) and the connection you feel between the characters makes you feel more attached to them. Characters: 10/10
Enjoyment: 10/10 easily. This was a great anime. The tension, the suspense, the surprise, the realization, the almost-crying moments I had in this anime, made this one of the most enjoyable experiences I have had with watching this anime. I binge-watched this throughout two days!
Overall: 10/10 This is honestly the best anime I have ever watched in my life. You definitely need to give this a try, It took me a long time to actually watch it but it was well worth it. Now time to make all the other animes, that I thought were 10 , a 9.",10

                The Science-Fiction Story of The Decade
The greatest anime I have ever had the pleasure to watch. Steins;Gate changed my life in that it made me into a truly hardcore anime fan. I only moderately watched anime before seeing S;G, you know the usual Naruto, Attack on Titan, Bleach, DBZ, Yugioh (mostly Shonen as you can tell), but I never gave the medium much thought. I thought I was gonna grow out of anime since the best one I saw at the time was frickin' Attack on Titan (I actually thought it deserved a 10 because I didn't know what a 10 actually meant at the
                  time and how good a show has to be in order to earn that). I love [almost] EVERYTHING about S;G and I'm talking about the most minor nitpicks you can imagine (like not really liking Daru's character, but that's irrelevant since he doesn't have much to do in og S;G). Okabe Rintarou is the best protagonist I've seen (and S;G 0 proves that). The amount of torment this man has to go through and it not feeling like the writers were throwing darts at a board of ideas on the worst possible ways they could do that is nothing short of spectacular. Makise Kurisu is the only great interpretation of a Tsundere character I've seen so far. The way she treats people in the beginning is justified by what we see of her past. She is the perfect representation of what strong female leads should be in any medium. Mayuri is the sweetest thing in the universe. A living breathing cinnamon roll too pure for this cruel world. There are other characters, of course, each memorable for other reasons, but they aren't the main thing which makes S;G standout and that's its story and its take on time travel. Every rule makes sense that which the show gives us.  Almost every episode past 11 is a 10/10. After finishing an episode you WILL. NOT. BE. ABLE. TO. STOP. WATCHING. For me, this wasn't just the case with episodes past episode 12. NO. I watched the whole show in one sitting since every episode ended on a mini-cliffhanger in which I wanted to know what would happen in the next episode. You have shows like JoJo's Bizzare Adventure which almost always end on a mini-cliffhanger, but I never wanted to know what might happen in the next episode, because I could [almost] always predict the outcome. Steins;Gate is the only show that was able to break my heart (if you watched the show you know which episode I am talking about) and make me connect with a characters suffering like never before and I believe no show will ever be able to do that to me again. More then a year after finishing it I am still in my post anime depression faze. I have about 400+ pictures of fan art, screenshots and other stuff related to S;G saved on my phone because I want to have more S;G in my life. I have a youtube playlist of about 150+ videos about S;G in some way. I can't wait for the slew of S;G 0 videos that are gonna come out now that 0 is over. I'm just hoping they announce a slice of life series taking place in the S;G worldline so they don't accidentally break any rules they gave the original show and 0, because I NEED MORE STEINS;GATE IN MY LIFE.",10
"
                In my opinion, Steins; Gate is the greatest fictional story ever told. 
I watched the show for the first time last fall, and since then I have read the visual novel, watched the sequel show, watched the movie, watched the bonus episodes, and re-watched the show itself. I'm going to try to be as objective as possible in this review, but as you can see, I'm probably more than a little bit biased lol.
There will be minor spoilers in my review (character arcs and story tone, not any major events) so if you haven't seen the show yet, I strongly recommend that you do that
                  before reading any reviews. I promise that you don't want anything about this show getting spoiled for you.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Story: 10/10
I really hate to be one of those losers who say 'well, this is a thinking man's show', but in this case, it's sorta true. The story of Steins; Gate is incredibly complex. I didn't even fully understand it until I played through the visual novel and watched the show a second time. There are a lot of important details that you'll miss if you aren't paying close attention. Watching casually, I definitely think you could get a lot of enjoyment out of it, but to get the full experience, I think you have to be really invested in the show. Whether that's a positive thing or negative thing is up to you, I guess. Personally, I loved the complexity of it, and that's the main reason I gave it a 10. There's so much foreshadowing that you'll miss on your first watch, and it was honestly almost a better experience watching it the second time.
I'm going to review both halves of the story individually, since they're too different for me to lump together as one.
The first half of the show:
The first episode opens up with us meeting a self-proclaimed 'mad scientist', named Okabe Rintaro (or Hououin Kyouma, if you wish to use his true name) and his two friends, Daru and Mayuri. They spend most of their time goofing around in their 'future gadget lab' (which is really just a cheap apartment above a tube-tv store). Almost immediately though, some very strange things begin to happen, after Okabe meets a fellow scientist, Makise Kurisu. The first half of the show is, for the most part, fun, lighthearted, and goofy. It revolves around the gang experimenting in their lab, while simultaneously uncovering a bit of a mystery.
A lot of people's biggest issue with Steins; Gate is that this half is 'slow and boring', which I personally believe is flat out wrong. Although the tone is completely different from the second half of the show, it's still pedal to the metal from the very first episode. It always leaves you wondering what's going to happen next. In some ways, I almost like parts about the first half of the show more than the later half. It develops all of the characters really well and gets you attached to them, before the show tears your heart out of your body and rips it to shreds in front of your eyes later on.
The second half of the show:
Like I said, the tone in the second half of the show is almost the exact opposite of what it is in the first half. There are some dark moments in the first 11 episodes that give you a glimpse into what the later half of the show is going to be like, but even so, nothing can prepare you for it. Episode 12 is completely changes everything. Steins; Gate goes from a light-hearted comedy, to a sad, philosophical show with some incredibly deep themes. I really liked the first half of the show, I think I was pretty clear about that, but the second half of the show is a genuine masterpiece. Every episode is flawless, start to finish. It's been months since I last watched the show, and there are still so many memorable scenes and quotes that I find myself thinking about all the time. I wish I could talk more about this part of the show, but I do want to keep this spoiler free.
Art: 8/10
The show is over a decade old, but you wouldn't be able to notice from looking at it. The art style isn't exactly anything special, but it's pretty well done. Not a whole lot I can say about this other than that there are some really beautiful scenes.
Sound: 8/10
The voice-acting for Okabe and Kurisu is some of the best I've ever heard, but unfortunately, most of the other voice actors were mediocre to bad. Faris, one of the side characters, has the single most annoying voice in the entirety of anime, but it does fit her character, I guess. Mayuri's voice was equally annoying at first, but it kinda grew on me the more I watched the show.
The music is phenomenal, with a ton of memorable songs. I don't think the show would be the same without it's current soundtrack (plus the opening is a banger, and one of the best openings ever).
Characters: 10/10
The characters are what takes this show from being really good, to being nearly perfect. I'll go through everyone in the main group one by one.
Okabe: I think Okabe is the best character in all of anime (at least until the later chapters of Vinland Saga get animated). Everything about him and his character arc is incredible. He's not perfect. He gives up. He has to make sacrifices. He has to rely on his friends. That's what makes him so great. He's not the typical anime protagonist who can level a city block by waving his hand or something. He's a normal guy, who stumbles into a terrible situation, and just wants to protect his friends. Seeing his transformation from an 'insane mad scientist', to a tired, broken man by the end of the show is really powerful. It's a pretty realistic portrayal of what I think anyone would be like after going through the type of stuff that he goes through.
Kurisu: Makise Kurisu is about as good as a side character can get in an anime. The way her and Okabe play off of each-other, even in normal, meaningless conversations is awesome. I've never seen two characters have as much chemistry as those two do. Similar to Okabe, she's an extremely believable character, and you really do end up feeling the things that she's feeling, as she makes some incredibly tough choices later in the show. She comes off like a bit of an asshole at first (anyone probably would if a 'mad scientist' came up out of nowhere and started talking a bunch of nonsense to you), but she'll probably end up being one of your favorite characters by the end. I can't really go into much more detail than that, because most of her best scenes come at very important moments in the show, but she really is a great character.
Mayuri: Mayuri is a character that I don't think gets enough credit. At the start of the show, it seems like she's basically a completely air-head, but as the show goes on, we find out that she's actually a super complex character. She's far from the idiot that show tries to make us think she is at the start (although she still says and does some dumb stuff sometimes). She gets used as a way to move the plot along a lot of the time, but once she gets developed, she becomes one of the best characters in the entire show.
Daru: If there was one thing I had to say I disliked about this show, I would have to say that it's Daru. There's a running joke where he pervs on basically every female he meets, and that includes actual children, because of course it does. I understand that it's okay to joke about that kind of stuff in Japan (at least it seems that way based on how often it's done in anime), but it's still really weird and hard to ignore. Other than that though, he's fine I guess? He doesn't really get developed as much as the other characters, and is mostly just used for comic relief.
Other side characters:
There are few characters outside of the main four that get introduced as the story progresses, all of which have their own little character arcs that they go through. We get to learn all of their backstories and motivations, which is done pretty well. There are a few that are really good, but this review is already way too long, so I'm gonna have to skip over them, unfortunately.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Well, I enjoyed the show, if you couldn't tell based on the rest of this review.
There's just so much to love about it. It's funny, it has great characters, it has an amazing story, etc. Even if, for whatever strange reason, you ended up not liking the show, I think it's literally impossible to be bored while watching it.
Overall: 10/10
Steins; Gate is the closest thing to a masterpiece that I can think of. I truly don't think there will ever be another show like it. I think it's pretty easily the greatest anime ever made, and I'd go as far to say that it's the greatest show in general, including live-action. There are some flaws if you really want to nitpick, but the story and characters are nearly perfect. If for some reason, you still haven't watched this show, DO IT. I don't know what else to say to convince you. It's so unbelievably good, that I find myself comparing it to other shows all the time, even ones that have nothing in common with it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even though I've been sitting here writing this review for almost 2 hours, I still feel like I didn't do this show justice. As goofy and corny as this sounds, it really did change the way I look at a lot of things. I can't overstate how much this show has meant to me over the past year. I think it's the reason that I'm so into anime and manga as a whole now. It taught me that anime isn't just shonen action, and it truly can tell deep, meaningful stories. It really opened me up to a whole world of other fantastic shows and movies. 
Thanks for reading this way-too-long review, goodbye :)",10

                This show has talked about to death, and for good reason. It does the time travel plot well, it has a memorable cast of characters, there's a solid emotional core, and occasionally you'll even get some comedy. The first half of the show moves a little slower but I personally was invested and interested from the start, and thought that these opening parts were necessary for developing the characters and setting up the mechanics of time travel in this world (which to the show's credit it rarely contradicts, time travel is easy to mess up and they manage to keep everything straight and have it
                  all make sense within the fictional rules).
But the second half is where everything comes together. Okabe, our likable if a little odd protagonist, is introduced to us as a happy-go-lucky weirdo who is still both remarkably intelligent and a good friend to those he cares about. This makes the mental scars he endures and the ways they change him even more striking as he realizes just how dangerous meddling with time can be, even in ways that seem small at first. We see him have to undo the changes he's made, even if it means ripping away the idealized realities his friends have created for themselves. We also see him watch his innocent, always caring childhood friend killed right in front of his eyes more times than he can count. 
At the same time, Okabe also gets to know all these people around him better, to empathize with them, and to understand what they mean to him, even if none of them remember any of it when he inevitable resets the time loop to try things again. The love story that becomes prominent near the end of the show would feel more forced if we hadn't seen the connection between Okabe and Kurisu across all these different timelines, and after all he's gone through, Okabe definitely earned his happy ending.
Further things I love about this anime: it nails its atmosphere and utilizes silence to great effect, it manages to combine comedy and drama in ways that work and don't feel forced, it makes sure that each character matters and is a piece of the puzzle (whether for the main story or in the way they affect Okabe personally), and it's full of twists I didn't see coming. Steins;Gate is legendary for a reason.",10
"
                People are using the term ""Masterpiece"" far too often. Just to be clear, Stein;gate is good show, but just not as good as what people claimed it to be. This is a more objective review of the show so please let me explain before jumping to the conclusion ""what? Stein;gate should be at least a 9.""
Stein;gate is in its essence a romance show that successfully incorporates sci-fi elements, it isn't something you see in other animes, so already Stein;gate is unique in terms of its genre. It has a solid plot line with much twists and hidden lines that keep you on the edge of
                  the seat and several great character designs. I've seem many praises about the show so forgive for not going too deep into the positive aspects of the show. Now why is it not a 9 or 10 then? 
The first problem is the pacing of first 10 episodes, at the same time it is necessary to set up all instances of D-mail for the plot that follows, it is also a very poor choice to spend almost half of the series on the set-up. The reason why first 10 episodes feels particularly painful in Stein;gates is that the show attempts to make you feel intrigued by having Okabe accidentally changes the world line by sending a D-mail. And that fact is never explained until several episodes later. Now it is a good strategy to keep audience from the truth in order to keep them interested, as utilised in many detective movies. However the fundamental difference being that in those type of movies, the plot is apparently moving towards the solution in a steady pace while as in Stein;gate, the plot suddenly jumps to Okabe introducing lab members, the banana experiment and hacking into SERN, which happened from (episode 2 to 4). Under the premise that the viewer was not spoiled before watching the show, it is hardly believable that a solid connection could be drawn between the banana experiment and the change of the world line at episode 4. So what it appears to many viewers is that show left a puzzle unexplained then suddenly moved on other remotely relevant staffs. It is another rule in many episode-based series that if you leave a puzzle unexplained and proceed on plots that are seems irrelevant to the puzzle for more than 3 episodes, it causes a negative emotion from the audience (notice that I use the word ""seems"" because it is in fact relevant to the story telling, but it is just a poor way to tell a story, especially when what follows are 6 episodes of ""slice of life"" where each member get to send their own D-mail), you can see this kind of story-telling in the infamous SAO, where a main plot is introduced in first episode then followed by completely irrelevant bullshits. I mean no offence to stein;gates, but the way stein;gates' first 10 episodes are proceeded are really bad for the overall enjoyment. I understand that you can't judge a show by its first 10 episodes and yes, the rest of the story is great, but keep in mind that first 10 episodes is also a part of the show. 
What makes the first ten episodes more unbearable is the Art in steins; gate, now you notice that steins; gate has an art style that is mainly black and white with not much emphasise on other colours, by that I don't mean it is a bad choice of art style and that every show should be like No Game No Life with colours all over, no, what I mean is this choice of colour is again a very poor combination with the show's slowly-paced first ten episodes, it becomes a test of patience when both the story is progressing slowly and the colour, monotonous. Also another thing to point out is that I can't help but to feel that the background setting is too dull, that is, most of the scene happened in Okabe's Lab, and when it isn't, there are always strange white lights all over the screen particularly when the scene happened outdoor. (Are those strange white lights a way to represent sunshine? Not very effective in my opinion.)
Now coming back to the plot itself, I also wanna talk about the science aspect of the show, steins;gate does a great job at proposing an at least acceptable theory and is consistent through out the show (don't get me wrong, most shows that touch on concepts that are apparently unscientific they just leave it unexplained or come up with ridiculous concepts, like the newly aired show Bonny Senpei uses quantum mechanics that seems stupid and contrived.) On this part, steins;gate has a well-rounded theory and makes audience comfortable with. With that being said, What I am NOT comfortable with is how characters in steins;gate do scientific staffs with incredibly unscientific senses. There are two scenes I feel intellectually insulted while watching steins;gate: 1. Okabe tries to hack into SERN without considering any consequence that it might cause. Now if you realise, SERN is the anime version of CERN, or European Organization for Nuclear Research, as the show suggests, CERN in real life is doing nuclear colliding experiments, since the show tries to make SERN in the anime sounds very similar to the real CERN, I can't help but to question if anyone with a common sense would ignore the consequences of hacking CERN, especially when Daru is portrayed as a great hacker, how could he do thing that is just utterly stupid from a common sense. This makes the story of Mayuri killed by SERN agents a little forced in my opinion, this could just be me overthink too much. 2. Okabe lets several other people use his time-machine to send messages that he didn't even know the content. I know steins; gate is never meant to be a sci-fi show but this scene really triggers me. The show tries to explain away these stupid actions by giving Okabe the name ""mad scientist"",  but even then these two scenes really lowered my score for story of steins;gate, it seems like massive deus ex machina to me. 
Now let's talk about the romance aspect of the show, there are two things that I feel steins; gate did poorly on. First being the fact that Okabe was like ""dating Ruka and Faris"" when the story is supposed to feel intense, it is the moment when romance and horror sci-fi do not work too well together, there are moments where I lost the tension for the show that it sets up in the previous episodes. Another thing is that Okabe's romances with other side characters feel forced and rushed. Especially in Faris' case, If I recall correctly, there isn't any scene in previous episodes where Okabe has development of any sort with Faris, they are just friends, I wouldn't even call them close friends by any means. But then Faris went on calling Okabe ""Prince"" and hugged him, this feels particularly unexpected and forced, I understand that the series is adapted from game and that the anime is compelled to cover Faris' storyline, but it is just not a coherent development. However the romance with Kurisu was very well developed in my opinion, with Steins; gate movies and other products of the franchise. 
Last but not least, I want to quickly touch upon character designs in this show, Okabe is a very likeable character and I have not seen much personality of his sort in other animes, his Chunibyou is a great tool to alleviate the embarrassment in scenes. Kurisu is of the tsundere type but doesn't prevent her becoming a likeable character. But other characters are bit too stereotypical: we have loli-like girls with ""tuturu"" and lady-like girl and a cat-girl with ""meow"" and a typical otaku hacker. They aren't necessarily bad characters, I just don't feel they are outstanding character designs. Nevertheless, main characters are all great so it is not a big problem in terms of the overall enjoyment of the show. 
So to conclude, Steins; gate is a good show, but with an analytical approach, I just don't feel this is a masterpiece by any means, it has several flaws that prevents me from rating it any higher.",7

                Story 10/10:
The story is 10/10 because the plot will surprise you and will blow your mind. The story is well explained that's why I gave it a 10/10.
Art and Character 10/10:
The art is 10/10 because the animation is really good, character designs are original and very appealing to the eye. Character development is great because all of them develops throughout the span of 24 episodes. Also note that they have received enough screentime.
Sound 9/10:
I gave the sound/music a 9/10 because it's not that catchy but when you finish the anime it sounds very nostalgic and I feel like I want to sing it XD.
Enjoyment and
                  Overall 10/10:
Overall, I really enjoyed the show. In fact, it ended up as one of my favorite animes. The story, art, music and the characters are really a masterpiece. I recommend you watch this now! You'll not regret it.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is a show proclaimed as a masterpiece almost universally by anime fans around the globe, and has held its place among the top three anime series on MAL for as long as I can remember. When watching such an acclaimed series, there is always a chance that the show may be overshadowed by such hype, leading to unmet expectations and disappointment. Thankfully that is not the case with Steins;Gate, and here is why you too should experience it in all its glory.
Story: 10/10
Steins;Gate follows the trials and tribulations of Okabe Rintarou and his fellow lab members at the ""Future Gadget Laboratory"", where generally they
                  invent all sorts of useless gadgets. That is until Okabe and lab member number 3, Daru invent a microwave that can send text messages back in time, and Okabe accidentally uses the device during a moment of crisis, setting off a chain of events that eventually leads to the gang butting heads with the evil organisation ""SERN"", who have their own ambitions. The first few episodes are quite slow, as we are introduced to the different characters and eases us into the main plot. The show then kicks it into high gear around episode 7, and what follows is a complex and deeply emotional story about time travel and the possible drastic effects it can have. Each episode thereafter drives the plot forward, with many unexpected twists and turns along the way. After this point the episodes are paced to perfection, presenting new details to the overall mystery surrounding the effects of time travel and ""SERN"".  Although Steins;Gate so far has an OVA and a movie which further develops the ending of the show, the ending presented here is satisfying, and more than enough for most viewers. Overall the story in Steins;Gate comes as close to perfection as any I have seen, and is truly a masterpiece.
Characters: 10/10
Although the story in Steins;Gate is masterfully crafted, it's the characters and their relationships with one another that keeps the viewer invested. While the story mainly focuses on Okabe, his ""assistant"" Makise Kurisu, his childhood friend Mayuri, and resident hacker Daru, the cast is also made up of many supporting characters who have their own arcs and are given an extensive amount of character development throughout the show. This is quite rare as many of the shows I have watched have sacrificed their supporting cast to focus more on a central relationship in the show (e.g Your Lie In April), and luckily that is not the case here. This gives the effect where it is nearly impossible to nail down a characters motivations and how knowledgeable they are about the mystery in the show until after the credits role. A character you though was only a bit part player could hold all the pieces on the board, and another character whose intentions seemed innocent may have had ulterior motives all along. The show also does a fantastic job of showing its characters actions as grey, putting them into perspective, and in truth the show has no real villains, something that I have only seen Miyazaki pull off as well as Steins;Gate did. Having said all that, the show does have one relationship that stands out above all others as the most entertaining and heartwarming, that of Okabe and Kurisu, whose interactions both drive the story forward and keep the audience interested, especially in the first few episodes.
Art and Animation: 8/10
Unlike the rest of the show, the art and animation are nothing special, as there are really no jaw-droppingly beautiful scenes to draw or animate. Although this aspect of the show is nothing special, it is still very well done and never really drew my attention away from the plot and characters, so therefore it does exactly what it should.
Sound: 9/10
Although the soundtrack in this show never reaches the level of a Watanabe show, it is completely serviceable and is very effective at creating a tense atmosphere in one scene, and a lighthearted atmosphere in the next. The OST also has some standout tracks, especially the opening ""Hacking at the Gate"". This show also has an excellent dub, which holds up to and even surpasses the original. The voice cast have great chemistry with each other, with each character being perfectly casted, especially J. Michael Tatum's performance as Okabe.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Overall I really enjoyed Steins;Gate. It has the perfect blend of Sci-Fi, slice of life, comedy and psychological elements, with an engaging plot and compelling characters. If all of this sounds even remotely interesting to you, then don't waste a minute more reading this review, and instead engross yourself in the world of Steins;Gate. It will not disappoint.",10

Story 10/10 [SKIP IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS]
Okabe Rintaro, a self proclaimed Mad Scientist and a total weirdo. Okabe and his Otaku friend, Daru find themselves with a phone controlled microwave that can allow emails to be sent to the past when connected to the microwave. Here's how it all happened. Okabe met a girl, Makise Kurisu through unforseen
                  circumstances, he met her at a science conference and ended finding her murdered by the end of it. At that moment, Daru sent him a message while Daru's phone was connected to the microwave. Okabe finds himself at the exact same spot but something was different. Makise Kurisu was alive...
They uneventfully 'met' each other 'again' and Okabe showed Kurisu his time machine (Microwave) and they began experimenting to see if it trully does send emails to the past.
This is when the story begins. They hacked into an Organization SERN only to find out that their theories of the company researching Time Travel is true.
As they send messages back in time, Okabe realised that when the past is changed, everyone does not remember what happened except him.
Whenever the time machine is activated, a new world line is created. A world line where there is a separate reality, where something is changed. Okabe however, retains the memories of the previous world lines...
Eventually, SERN raided Okabe and his friends as Okabe and his friends had discovered too much and had to be detained. SERN ultimately kills Okabe's best friend Mayuri and that forces him to attempt to save her by going back in time, each time watching Mayuri die... and die... and die...
It was futile.
She dies even when SERN didn't lay hands on her... He eventually succumbed. BUT a major plot twist unravels and he discovered a real time machine with the help of Kurisu and a girl named Suzuha. 
It was revealed that there was a way to save Mayuri, to alter the future completely and reaching a 1% on the divergence meter. The future is full of dystopia but reaching a 1% will attain peace.
Okabe realised that he has to undo things he did in the other world lines to save Mayuri. He undid the things he did... Namely, helping his friends achieve what they wanted the most. Meaning, he sacrificed his friend's dreams/wishes.
Finally, he undid everything his friends wished for, from wishing for a father to come back alive to wishing for a change in gender... He sacrificed all those wishes...  Realising he has one more final thing to accomplish in order for the divergence meter to reach 1%...
During the many time leaps and changes in world lines, each time watching Mayuri die, he also developed deeper bonds with the girl that was always there for him... Kurisu... Makise Kurisu...
That was when he realised he has to make the hardest, harshest decision of his life... Kurisu's death... Kurisu, his one true love's death.
As of episode 22, I was almost brought to tears. Looking at everything through Okabe's eyes... The despair and pain too hit me as a viewer.
But... Episode 23, everything changed. Okabe realised that there is one way he can save Kurisu, thanks to the Okabe 15 years in the future, he realised the only way to save his one true love was to make his past self believe that Makise Kurisu did get murdered when she actually didn't, lying to his old self about her death to reach the Steins Gate world line, the only world line where everyone lives.
He successfully decieved the Okabe in the Original world line, allowing everything to continue as per normal and also saving Kurisu.
Finally, everything was settles and he gave every lab member a pin for recognition despite only him knowing what it signifies due to his innate ability to remember other world line occurances.
I am extremely grateful that Kurisu lived, that she was saved.
Art 10/10 
I really enjoy the art concept. It has a gloomy scenery and how the characters dressed also played a part.The style of the characters also sort of contradict yet suit their attitudes and follow a certain dress code. Kurisu's character design is also... Damn, she might even be good enough to be my 11th waifu
Character 10/10
I really enjoyed the character's personalities. They all had something weird and special about them. Okabe with his delusions aof many non-existent things. It really played a part as when he eventually stopped his delusions, you know it had to be a very big thing...
Mayuri with her acting and being dumb, a trap.. oof .. I can't spoil the other characters too.
I've said too much
Sound 9/10
Op&Ed perfecto, voice acting perfect. It must've been difficult to act for Okabe with all that shouting.
Overall 10/10
I really thank the writer for allowing the anime to end with a happy ending. To me at first, it seemed inevitable that the anime would end off with someone precious dying.
Now, it is time for the sequel movie because there is no such thing as happy endings when you mess with fate.
And afterward, the alternative setting where my dear Kurisu dies (Steins;Gate 0)

                Steins;Gate throws so many curveballs that it was a little difficult for me to keep track.  This was especially the case for the first episode (I had even considered rewatching this episode in particular just to wrap my head around the story and ease my mind, but the answers came in due time).  Nonetheless, these curveballs and plot twists were all what made the show so thrilling to watch.  I was at the edge of my seat for the first several episodes and for the last three, but the middle section had lost some of it's bite because it had seemed somewhat
                  repetitive to me.  I'm not sure if it was because I can be dense at times or because I didn't pay too much attention to love interests, but I was a little shocked by one specific curveball:  a romantic pairing.  Throughout Steins;Gate, it was hinted that Okabe had feelings for two of the female main characters with heavy emphasis on one more than the other (most especially in the opening).  From the several scenes that exhibit these feelings, I thought to myself that either of the female characters would make a good pair with Okabe, but I assumed the that the one with more emphasis would be the one he ended up with.  But, in true Steins;Gate fashion, unbeknownst to me, a curveball was thrown my way.",10

My Review:
There is no other anime like Steins;Gate in terms of story, plot Twist. funny, immersion, intense, and occasionally creepy, Steins;Gate contains just about everything you could ask for in an anime series. Steins;Gate is flawless, for me, it's worthy to be considered an anime a true masterpiece. This portion of the show is the foundation of why this show is so great and a masterpiece. As a result, when the show starts to pick up midway, Steins;Gate starts to truly shine, and the PLOT THICCens.

                Many find this anime amazing, however, many also find it awful. So, a lot might be wondering why this anime has a lot of great reviews. Yep, trust the reviews! People might find this anime as slow-paced because you really can't find it interesting throughout the first few episodes, and that is because that is where it's building its foundations. It kinda sucked from the beginning to the 7th episode, or eight? Yeah, I mean, it didn't suck, but you don't really get the excitement in watching it. It doesn't give you the chills and thrills and all those stuff to keep you on track
                  on this anime. But, I'm telling you, when you get to the part where it's exciting, it never stops.
So, yeah, this anime has a lot of great reviews, has great ratings, but not many have seen it because of those several reasons. But, it is an assurance, like 100%, that this anime will be much appreciated when you see it.
YEAH!!!",10

                ""El Psy Congroo.""  
If you've seen Steins;Gate, you'll know where this phrase comes from.  Steins;Gate is a story revolving around a young 'mad' scientist - Hououin Kyoma - better known as Okabe Rinataro or 'Okarin.'  Obsessed with ground-breaking discoveries and an ever-ready group of friends, Kyoma establishes the 'Future Gadgets Lab' (FGL).  After stumbling upon the perfect precursor technology for time manipulation, Kyoma embarks on an adventure, continuously biting off more than he can chew.
The story was told from the perspective of Kyoma and his friends at FGL.  Most of the episodes fit together nicely with each successfully leading into
                  the next.  However, I didn't find the story line overly intriguing.  While the show is far from being completely dull, it didn't captivate my attention.  It starts out slow - especially the first 2-3 episodes - then begins to pick up pace.  Eventually, mid-way through the show, however, curiosity begins to wane as the unsatisfactory plot unfolds.  I found the ending to be appropriate but bland - nothing special.
The art style is decent considering Steins;Gate was first released in 2011.  The art isn't unduly unique or memorable compared to other shows but it gets the job done.  Character designs are distinctive which is a positive.  The art fits the story well and that's all that matters.
I watched the English SUB of this show and can attest to all of the voice actors doing well with their respective characters' persona.  No voice stood out of place or felt inappropriate.  Background music was sporadic but worked well for its scenes.  The opening and ending music was loud but enthralling.  I enjoyed both and rarely skipped either.
The characters were well-developed in their own niches.  However, none of the characters seemed to 'grow' with time.  They didn't deteriorate nor did they improve upon their flaws, choosing instead to remain stagnant in their strengths and weaknesses.  Both the protagonists and the antagonist had clear-cut goals and intentions; however, except for their name, the antagonist is never revealed.  Most of the adversaries in the show are simply minions of the true antagonist.
I enjoyed watching certain parts of Steins;Gate.  After getting the initial few episodes out of the way, I believed this show would have a fascinating story line with endless possibilities for advancement.  Unfortunately, the route taken didn't leave much of an impression.  I firmly believe that many anime fans will enjoy this show.  I also believe that many won't simply due to the anticlimactic and disappointing story line.  I won't be re-watching Steins;Gate any time soon.  
It's not a terrible show, it's simply not an amazing one.",4

                Steins;Gate is an anime adaptation of a game of the same name by 5pb and Nitroplus. The story follows self proclaimed ""mad scientist"" Okabe Rintarou who somehow manages to accidentally create a time machine from a microwave.
Story
the story is based upon a visual novel, keeping true to the story from the original game. I loved this spectacular tale and delves in time traveling quite a bit. The story takes off in a slow pace, but once the series gets off the ground, the ride is magnificent and thrilling. the story has no plot holes and is wonderfully executed. The vanilla sweet romance is there and
                  all the crazy time travel mystery kept me wanting more. Overall the story is a definite 10, if you give it a chance to bloom.
Art
The art style is very unique, a trait I look for in shows as almost everything spouted out now looks like a blur of overly generic trash. The character designs are all beautifully drawn and sleek, I just love Makise Kurisu's design. Backgrounds and effects are almost photorealistic, maybe not quite makoto Shinkai quality but amazing nonetheless. the unique art style I believe is an essential part of making a truly memorable anime.
Sound
The Seiyuus are really exceptional, especially Okabe's CV capturing his eccentric, flashy and slightly goofy personality. Kurisu's CV does a stellar job with the character's tsundere. The cast does a fine job in this anime and the OP never goes unplayed when i am watching.
Character
All characters are very memorable and unique, Okabe is just a great mad scientist, totally crazy and provides you with comic relief and a holds great chemistry with every one of the other characters, nobody feels out of place and it is too hard not to love Mayurii and Makise. 
Enjoyment
Sadly the first few episodes seemed to drag on but give it a bit longer and you will realise how beautiful the story is. Once this flower had bloomed, I was hooked until the end. The last few episodes were just mindboggling and full of beautiful circumstance. the whole experience was like a rollercoaster, the climb was slow and boring but as it got more exciting, the tighter I held on and didnt let go until the ride was over.
Overall this anime is a must watch, definitely for anyone who would love an anime spin on Doctor Who. heck, even if you don't watch anime I'd still recommend that you watch it.

                Steins;Gate follows the story of Okabe Rintarou. He's a somewhat paranoid looking self-proclaimed mad scientist who works on bizarre experiments in order to eventually one day rule over the world. In reality, he has a sad looking lab that is more of a simple room he rents over an electronic store. He can barely pay the rent sometimes. Hardly anyone takes his theater act seriously and he is often made fun of and ridiculed. That doesn't stop him from working on experiments and constantly updating them with nonsensical names that aren't really upgrades. Part of his act is that he is always in contact with
                  his imaginary organization, and often talks to himself pretending to be talking to them when he gets put in desperate situations. Then there's his iconic laugh. There's no denying he is one of the most loveable and interesting characters in the medium. As the series progresses, his character will grow and show more sides of him. In the beginning, he puts on the paranoid act, and later one, he finds good reason to.
As he starts to work on experiments with his friend Itaru the otaku, they discover that they have found a way to send emails back in time. This eventually leads to time travelling. It also leads to them getting targeted by shadowy figures. A lot of the science behind this series is made up to try to rationalize what is going on as everything begins to distort. Too many viewers took this too seriously. Have they ever time travelled before? What authority do they have to criticize this when the writing does more than good in trying to make sense of what is going on? This is science fiction, which doesn't require the 100% reality analysis as long as it is written well enough. Sure, someone can subjectively say that it nonsense. However, subjectivity without explanation is irrelevant, and that happens too many times. So many say they don't like that something, though very few actually know or explain why. Reviewers should justify their positions and be as clear as they can.
From the beginning, the subtitles themselves are something. As a product of the internet, I could really relate to the internet humor that is in this series. Because it's specific to Japanese culture, the English subs incorporated Western internet humor into the jokes from around that time for the English audience, far back from around 2011. As a result, the jokes are very amusing and even involve mentions of 4Chan. The music can be haunting, or outright incredible such as in the opening sequence. This is one of those few series where I never skipped the opening sequence because it is that well done. I would even advise not to skip the opening for reasons that are amusing to find out on your own. Not only that, the ending sequence song is always a treat, especially after appearing right after many of the shocking twists and disturbing turns the series cliffhangers with, leaving the viewer drained and reflecting. There is a particular use of it without the credits in a certain episode that begins to show the viewers just how much of a disturbing situation Okabe has found himself in. There is realization of horror not just coming of him, but from the viewers when they realize it as well.
The story and mystery have impressive writing. Episode by episode, bits and pieces start to form together, and the viewers are left wondering what exactly is happening and theorizing. Loose ends get tied together eventually, character arcs come full circle, and yet something always seems to happen that keeps expanding the lore and the many possibilities. As complex and mysterious as the story is, everything feels tied together in a surprising way. The wonder of mystery in this series feels as if it doesn't ever end. The twists are always great with reveals that can leave one gasping. Even as a romance, it presents incredible and heartwarmingly emotional writing. And the comedy is among the highlights as well, and very relatable as I mentioned earlier.
Sometimes, Steins;Gate can drain the viewer's emotions and leave them empty. That's because this series tackles the horror behind time travelling, not just the wonder. Okabe's struggle becomes to create his ideal timeline. Despite that, sometimes sacrifices have to be made. In order to manipulate time and redo events that didn't go as planned, he has to undo events that are precious to him. Since he keeps his memories whenever he goes back, he is left constantly as if he were cursed with the memories of those events. This results in what feels like endless amounts of bittersweet moments. His descent into madness shows his desperation and fall into insanity. Regardless, he doesn't want to give up.
To try to understand this feeling he gets, think about dreams. Haven't you had dreams where you meet people you don't recognize and build friendships and romances with them and also with those that you do know? Eventually, you wake up happy still thinking it's real, just to realize it right away that it was only a dream. Then that feeling of loss and disappointment comes in. This feeling can relate to what Okabe feels.
After the set up in the first few episodes, the series goes out of control and never quite calms down. What I appreciate in this series is that no main character gets left behind. Each one gets deeply explored, and their innermost personal issues and ambitions get fleshed out and developed. Every character has a story, and this series makes each one matter, unlike other anime that often leaves characters behind and in the background. For example, Moeka is one of the more minor characters. Despite that, the twisted abyss of her mind and insecurities gets explored enough and shows her paranoid vulnerability, and desire to belong to something that can give her a reason to want to be alive. An isolated disaster, it's some of the most darkest content in Steins;Gate. Not only that, there's the topic of Suzuha, which explores the satisfaction, or maddening dissafaction one feels in lifetime accomplishments, and Yugo, the father who would go to the questionably extreme for her daughter.
For a long time, Steins;Gate was a series I always saw from a distance. Many viewers accused it of trying too hard and failing to be intelligent, to calling out it's fans as elitists. Yes, people who have never made an anime, and never learned how to, have all the answers somehow. Now, neither have I, though I try to be more critical than that. It's cursed alongside other anime for supposedly being ""too slow and boring."" I feel the need to address this out of annoyance. Honestly, these viewers are just not paying attention. The story building in Steins'Gate would perhaps be more amusing if viewers would stop looking at their social media every 5 minutes and turning on the 3X speed. If viewers feel the need to watch anime faster, they might as well just drop the series. Some are too used to anime that is easy and brain free to consume. The Western oversaturated film industry of bland and soulless action works has conditioned people into losing their attention spans because that is what they get used to. It must have guns, sex, violence, and explosions, or else it's garbage! When something that isn't action that requires some thinking comes around, it's looked at with hostility. At it's core, there is a hatred for thinking that is all too commonly found. The hatred for thinking is by design when one begins to look into what is making people act this way.
Think about it. It was cool to be the braindead loser in high school. It's not cool to be the nerd. Those who were smart had to start failing their grades and ruin their own lives just to fit in. Those who develop a passion for studying get made fun of. Where did this kind of bullying come from? Even media tricks people into thinking that different is bad. In actuality, the normal is what is boring. If everyone looked and thought the same, the power structure would win without worry. It is the people who are weird, different, and outcasts that create the most excitement in life and who really stir up influence on the masses and history.
Looking back at old board posts from 2011 when Steins;Gate first aired, it was praised everywhere, even where it wouldn't be expected. Despite that, it bored people to see this in people's favorites. People's favorites are about what they want to pick, not what others want them to. To say someone's taste is boring is condescending. How could one use their own taste as the authority to criticize someone else's this way? If someone watches anime with passion, they're favorites and 3X3 will always change. This is my case, as my favorites continue to morph, as I begin to find more and more anime that feels like it can give Ashita no Joe and Legend of the Galactic Heroes a run for their money. Can they be topped for me? I would hope so.
Coming from Texhnolyze, I can see it in this series, as Hiroshi Hamasaki directed both. I appreciate that Chiyomaru Shikura, who wrote Steins;Gate, composed the opening himself for his own adaptation. Steins;Gate left me with a memorable experience. If I had to complain, I would have liked to know more about ""Reading Steiner."" The stakes are really high here also, though the amount of convenience here can take away from it. Also, Mayuri nearly annoyed me with her ""tutturu"" goofy personality, though it grew on me eventually. Despite that, I was glued to my screen and watched most of this in two days out of how impressed I was with it. A lot of times I tend to pause and get distracted. Not here. I was fully engaged with the episodes. I feel for those that had to wait months when it first came out for each weekly one. As the timelines continue to expand, Steins;Gate amazes with the wonder of possibility and making your own destiny.",10

                Overall probably my favorite anime of all time. Sure the quality of the art wasn't the best but it really matched the story and the mood very well making it negligible. I absolutely loved the sound track. It really grasped the theme, mood, and story really well making it fit in perfectly. I really liked most of the characters in this anime. Like the main character okabe or kyouma was funny and was very chuunibyou but to a extent that it didn't annoy and ruin the mood all the time like some other animes. And don't get me started on kurisu, she is the definition
                  of a perfect tsundere but since shes super smart it adds a whole new element to her personality. Lastly this anime was very enjoyable because of its pace, it took the main story in and how it brought seriousness and funniness along with it and didn't over do it on both. I also really enjoyed the romance that occatioanally popped up but wish there could have been more. Anyway overall ill give this a 10/10 because its probably the best anime you will get in this genre with mixture of comedy, action, sci-fi, and  romance",10
"
                I'm going to be honest, it took me over a month to push myself through the first 5 episodes. But once the series picked up speed, it did so intensely and amazingly. I'm not going to get into the story, since I can't add much to what has already been said without spoilers, instead I will talk about the anime itself and its selling points.
Perhaps one of the most appealing things I've noticed about this series is how unlike many other forms of media involving the paradoxical effects of time travel, it cares little about explaining the technicalities. The series does not take its viewers
                  for fools. Instead it briefly covers the general concept, then simply allows the events that follow to speak and lets the viewers enjoy the ride while being able to think over what we've witnessed ourselves. Especially for one like myself who has looked up on multiple clashing theories, it is great to see many of them appear here in a creatively combined stream, and do so without worrying too much about every theoretical detail, but instead put them straight into action with a fast-paced storyline.
If you don't have any interest in the subject, it is a great bloody anime regardless. Even with so many great factors adding to the flow of the plot, they certainly did not slack on the other aspects, especially the characters. Each and every one of them are loveable and uniquely quirky. They are the backbone of the series, providing the sometimes laugh-out-loud humour as well as the effectively heart-wrenching drama. And the character development, oh my, the character development. The way they delve into every member of the cast and their surrounding stories, exposing themes, motifs, and conflicts that pull away from the fantasy, sci-fi setting, and the progress of every interaction and relationship is reason enough to recommend this show. I am no big fan of romance when it is added into anime with more pressing or conflicting genres, but it doesn't feel forced or shoehorned here, instead they do well to blend the slice-of-life tones with the chaos going on.
This series is, as clich√© as it sounds, simply a roller coaster. A steady start, then a rapid nonstop thrill ride with ups, downs, twists, and turns. You will not regret watching this.

                As a fan of sci-fi thrillers as a child, I have longed to see a good time travel anime that would finally satisfy what I was looking for. After watching Steins;Gate, I can safely say that my expectations were surpassed for this amazing anime.
Story: 10/10 
When I first watched Steins;Gate, I was amazed of how complex its story was structured and composed. Although the first few episodes start off quite slow, the execution of the story is perfect, as well as its interesting explanation of how time travel works from within the series. It also got me to realize how important each character is to
                  the story, as well as the choices that Rintaro Okabe (the main protagonist) makes, which can lead to many different routes/world lines from within the story.
Characters: 10/10
From the beginning of Steins;Gate to the end, we get to see all of the characters develop well. Not only that, each character within Steins;Gate has their own unique personalities, as well as having a lot of comedic quarrels that kept me laughing. This goes from the Chuunibyou-obsessed Rintaro Okabe, to the supposedly cool-headed tsundere Kurisu Makise.
Enjoyment: 10/10
As stated before, I have enjoyed Steins;Gate from beginning to end, no matter how slow the pacing begins with. From the complex and intriguing story, to the proper execution and comedy of the series, I was able to thoroughly enjoy myself without finding anything too shabby about Steins;Gate.
Art/Sound quality: 10/10
The animation inside Steins;Gate was impeccable, including the incredibly catchy soundtracks and OST's that are included within the show. I had absolutely no issue with the animation and sound quality of Steins;Gate.
Overall: 10/10
Now I may seem like I am biased, but this is an honest review, as I am quite new to watching anime. If you're a sci-fi thriller fan, you will definitely enjoy Steins;Gate. It has a well structured story, as well as interesting characters and an amazing soundtrack. That is why I believe Steins;Gate deserves a 10/10.",10
"
                Stein's Gate starts out slow. Like really slow. I dropped it several times. But once I actually got through the first twelve episodes, it was one of the best anime I've ever seen. Why didn't I give it a 10? A couple of reasons- it mostly covers time travel, so the main theme isn't that relatable. Also, it has some loose ends- the only explanation about the apocalypse (can't write more or I'd spoil it) happening/not happening we get is ""It will be fine if you do/don't do this"", not anything particular. The style was nothing extraordinary, definitely not neglected though- it just didn't attract
                  attention to itself, maybe on purpose as to not disturb the story, although there were a couple of moments where it significantly affected the ""feel"". Other than that- the characters were lovable and reactive, even if a little annoying. In the end, Stein's Gate definitely has a place in my heart.",9
"
                You know when you get really hooked on something that you get little sleep and end up binge watching the entire 24 episodes? Yeah, that's what happened. I see why there's such great hype for this. It's a fantastic piece that deserves all the recognition it gets. It has its own unique spin on time travel packed with so many feelings that keep you curious and on end hitting ""next"" until it hits the end. The characters, each and every one of them, are so different from each other. You'll find your favorites from their amazing personalities. The art is well done, and the plot
                  is fantastic. There were a few plot twists that you wouldn't expect. Overall this gets a 10/10 on my list. A few flaws, but nothing too crazy. On to Steins Gate!",10

                TOO-TOO-RUU
That's probably the best way to start this ,as this is going to be my first review i will try to keep it short
Characters 10/10
Starting with what I observe the most whenever I watch any anime. The Characters . I have always searched for an anime with the perfect small cast and Steins;Gate was my final destination . The main cast Makise Kurisu, Mayuri Shina , Hashida Itaru and finally the ultimate protagonist Okabe Rintar... I mean Mad Scientist Hyouuin Kyouma. first the voice acting crew did fine job with the voices of all the main characters, their script and everything they said and how
                  they said was just Gold. 
I have a thing for tsunderes. Makise Kurisu is hands down the best I have seen (placing Hiragi Kagami from imaginary  my throne of tsundere waifuus) 
Next is Mayuri Shina an equally adorable and caring waifuu
Hashida Itarou :the perverted gentleman, supa haka, the very defination of us weabs but most  probably none us have the same level of IT knowledge as he does 
And probably one the best protagonist i have seen Okabe R.. sorry Hyouuin Kyouma I must say i feel sorry for what he's been through but he has the best mc character development and the coolest catch phrases after Jojos
Besides the side character  Moeka ,Ruka , Amane,Mr Braun ,Nae and Faristan meow ALL OF THEM played an important part to the show in every way
Story 10/10
After  ranting about the characters so much I will finally move into the  story. One could say that starting was very slow and it lacked pace but me being a fan of Slice Of Life animes I thought the starting was toptier. They slowly move into the plot of messing with time with each character slowly altering their past upto a piont where Okabe Rintarou is stuck in a deadly loop and he slowly solves this loop with sacrifices and more sacrifices. Honestly the pacing was what made this the only sci-fi that I could grasp with my mind while watching it .
Art  8/10 
They used a western style for Kyouma and Hashida and a more japanese style for the rest .not a problem I 
Sound 9/10
when listening carefully the background did a great job altering the modd in the scenes , and i also enjoyed the opening and endings
I think I could rate it 9.5 / 10 but it deserves 10/10
sorry i couldnt keep it short and fanboyed al the way here

                Time traveling is one of the most interesting theme in every form of entertainment. Although, only a few can execute it well; Steins;gate did an outstanding job at that department.
The first few episodes were slow and, I dare to say, sometimes boring. However, slow pacing and long dialogues and explanations really fit an anime about scientists, time traveling and experiments. The premise was just like any other which is to save the world from an organization plotting a world denomination-at the beginning. Scientists love to do experiments but what if what they're doing is the cause of their loved one's pain? What do you think
                  the mad scientists would feel and do? The transition of the original plot to the main objective of the protagonist in the second part is a factor of what made me love Steins;gate.
The jokes are basically Daru telling someone to repeat their lines which have a  double meaning, Kurisu saying pervert and the protagonist speech. The humor's actually pretty good but it's somewhat repetitive. I didn't expect "" I'm a mad scientist, so cool, Sonuvabitch!"" though :p
The execution of time traveling, as I said above, the creators of VN nailed it. I thought it would be: cause-> bad effect -> protag time travels-> boom, problem solved. Or something similar. I was wrong it was more than that. It was mind puzzling, confusing and many, if not all, need time to understand what's going on. Of course, on the first episode you would comprehend nothing but even if it's being explain you still can't figure it out, and that's what most of us want: a complex and hard to understand anime. 
I have nothing to complain about art except for the shape of the face of the protagonist; Seriously, why does his face look flat most of the time? Right? No.. just me? Ok.. `~`
As for the osts, nothing memorable. The opening is catchy and captivating, never skipped that. The VA of Kurisu and Okabe are enjoyable to listen to, they have this harmony when the time calls for it. From their voices, you can also hear the changes and feelings of the characters. From an enthusiastic mad scientist to a desperate man.
Knowingly it's based on a visual novel, I lowered my expectations for characters. (I.e. Yosuga no sora and Clannad) Supposed there is a male mc surrounded by a flock of girls (or traps!!), each girl has a chance to shine. I was right but it wasn't made the way I assumed. They had just enough screen time to sympathize with them, to understand their story and the buildup for the main story wasn't half-assed. Certainly in an anime, someone's tend to be an annoying girl who has to repeat her catchphrase everytime. Just let it pass, you'll like some things she's gonna do.
Character development  is a no-brainer here. You see, unlike highschooler-senpai love, here it's just understandable. 3 same weeks of desperation over and over again, you would  surely think that there's noone you could confide to and noone's going to know your situation; but then a friend comes you and say ' Don't fight alone, I'm here with you'.
I REALLY enjoyed this anime. It's not your average show. Steins;gate isn't for everyone but if you want something thrilling, complicated and heartwarming, Gogogo! Heck, it's so confusing I still haven't made sense of some parts of the anime. Another reason to rewatch the series lololol. Binge watching from ep. 8 to 20 isn't probably a good idea for this kind of show I think xD.

                I dont really know what to say here‚Ä¶ this anime blew me away.
There's thing that I want to tell everyone who is about to start this series cuz it would be a shame if you dropped it because the story didnt pick up fast enough. This is one of the few series (only other I can think of is Game of thrones) that gets better the more episodes you watch.
I never had any Problems giving a Anime a score but boy this is a close one. Something just missed in this genius story. I dont know what it is but there shure was sth. missing.
                  I really wanted to give this a 10 just because the charakters are amongst the best i've ever seen. Story is great but not perfect so nine out of ten. I thing this series didnt manage to get are these stunning animations and especially some good soundtracks that really manage to carry you away. So god damn close to ten but not quiet.
- one of the best anime i've ever seen [RECOMMENDED] -",9
"
                This is an amazing anime no doubt. Outstanding story and unbelievably unique characters that will stay with you forever. Unbelievably strong character development and plot structure. This is one of those anime's that you could easily re-watch the early episodes and every time you do you will end up connecting more dots - ""oh, so that's why that happened! I get it now!"", you will think to yourself.
The first 11 episodes are slow paced but for a reason. Don't give up watching because the early episodes are necessary to set the context for the outstanding story that follows. If you stick with this anime past
                  the midpoint, you will not regret it. Episode 12 is where the action starts and from there the action doesn't stop until the end.
Okarin, the main character is amazing . You will laugh with him, cry with him, and feel with him throughout his journey. Some characters seem annoying at first, but they grow on you too, so be patient. Honestly, everything about this anime is unique; the characters are unique, the plot is unique, the writing is unique; it's unlike anything I've ever seen before and that is what makes it so wonderful.
One of the best anime's I have ever seen.
If you are looking for a compelling story and strong character development, look no further.

                I'm not usually one to write reviews, but I had to for this anime.
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime; although the first 5 or so episodes were the weakest points for me. The rest however was captivating and I couldn't stop watching. So if anyone is put off by the first few episodes: keep watching, it is definitely worth it.
The growth of the characters, particularly the main character was brilliant. It was subtle yet you could definitely tell the difference between episode 1 Rintarou Okabe and episode 24 Rintarou Okabe. I found the character Mayuri Shiina to be a bit unrealistic. She just didn't seem like
                  she fit into the anime where the plot was pretty realistic, but in a more ""slice of life"" anime. She did eventually grow on me, and she became a bit more likeable and ""real"".
I would recommend this anime to everyone. It's a must-see.",9
"
                This is a very complex and complete anime: the protagonists and all the characters' personalities are well characterized and original. The story is complex and rich of turns of events and the theme of time-travels is handled in a very unusual way. Unfortunately it has a slow start and the story becomes very interesting around the middle of the series, so my suggestion is: give time to this anime, you won't regret it!

                The best series I have seen since Death Note. I like the psychological part of it. The only thing is that ""reading steiner"". That doesn't make sense, but everything else does. A perfect story with my kind of humor, very subtile, which doesn't spoil the horror mood for some reason. And it's amazing how many plot twists a series can have without getting all over the place!
I would have given it a 20 but this site only allows you to vote to 10.

                This is the third time in five years I try to watch this show and this is the first time I managed to get to the 14th episode, a couple episodes after the pivot point. I still couldn't manage watching, I had to switch off mid episode.
My curiosity pushed me to go online and see how the show ended and I have to say the story is well written. Sci-fi concepts are always tricky, especially time travel but they managed to keep it interesting.
Voice actors are good, the dub is also surpisingly high quality and the theme song is really catchy, I've never skipped it!
Everything
                  else I thought was bland.
The characters exist to fill in their stereotypical, harem-like roles : smart nerd, tsundere, bubbly, cute/naive, ultra shy, nyan girl.
Then you have the dumb big-mouthed main character whose development could have been handled less hamfistedly as his laughs got more and more irritating every time they were used.
What annoyed me the most was how the situations were handled; some actions taken aren't believable at all with Okabe just looking on, acting all surprised but not really reacting. Of course, all of this comes slamming back in his face later on.
The pace was excrutiating as half the season is used to introduce the characters and the environment. This is one of the main criticisms you can see online for this show, countered by the idea that the pace picks up after that. Unfortunately, my patience was used up at this point and if you don't like the characters, I guess there's no point in soldiering on.
The art style is mediocre, neither bad nor good; it serves its purpose. A lot of the backgrounds are static and I have to question the outdoor light choices though as it makes everything look overbright and out of focus.
All of this gives me a big pot of unrealised potential which is quite frustrating as the scenario could have given something beautiful had it been produced differently.",3

                The story is based on time travel, and the all the fortunate and unfortunate things that will occur in doing so. Good guys, bad guys, suspense, plotting, scheming, paradoxes, corporations, mystery, science, technology, plot twists, confusion, etc. 
Its based off the story of John Titor (real story). Basically, in the year 2000 he trolled the internet saying he was a time traveler sent back from the year 2036 and needed an IBM-5100 computer -- which was the only model able to utilize a certain language algorithm; even in the future -- in order to achieve a specific purpose. The story here differs, but it has
                  the same main points to an extent.
If you like time travel movies then its a must watch anime.
The characters are well done. The main ones all have strong differing personalities from on another. The main character is the funniest character I've seen in all of anime. Any temporary boredom that you may have from parts where it gets a bit ""sciency"" or slow will be eclipsed by the humor and charm this character provides. He's the most memorable character in anime to me, probably, at least in terms of positive retrospection.
The animation is very good. I hate low budget anime -- especially when it looks dated or the characters eyes are excessively large. The animation for this show is appropriate given the context as well. It's has a more modern and crisp look to it. In other words, it looks great and fits the show.
I think anyone will like this show. It's clever, funny, has twists and turns and suspense, but ultimately its just enjoyable to watch.",9

                Steins;Gate is so high on top anime list that I tried multiple times to watch it, but I couldn't take it. I really tried... I tried on 1,5x, watched 11 episodes and it doesn't get any better...
Despite having an interesting story of time travel, something I usually like. I'm into science fiction and slow paced animes. But this...this is unbearable. I can't bear the dialogues, the characters, the pacing. 
The dialogues are dragged, are usually expositions, most of them don't add to the story, to the characterization, and they try to be funny but the jokes don't land.
The characters are not believable, appealing or relatable.
                  I found them really annoying actually.
The pacing is so dragged oh my God. It doesn't matter if it is the smartest story ever with no plot holes. I'll rather watch a full lecture on a topic I'm not interested in than watching this anime.",1
"
                My rating is probably biased due to the fact that I read the Visual Novel before watching the adaptation and... oh boy! I loved the VN! Steins; Gate is definitely the BEST VN I've ever read! 10/10.
Naturally, after finishing the VN I was excited to see it animated and... well... What a HUGE disappointment it was! 
The anime is not horrible, but it pales in front of the VN.
It feels rushed, it changes vital scenes making it worse and loosing their significance to the plot. 
I feel that the anime doesn't do justice to the VN and after I finished watching I had to play

                *I watched this anime twice, both times subbed (not dubbed)*. Before even remembering whatever mess I saw years ago, I would have given this a 5 and stated here that it was overrated. Maybe you‚Äôll be disappointed, should you be persuaded to watch this anime. I‚Äôll admit it: I wasn‚Äôt astonished in my first watch. I thought it had plot devices with large amounts of monotonous and sometimes strange background information and plot contrivances. Perhaps I wasn‚Äôt even interested in the premise of time travel, or to what seemed like reasonable time travel. Back then, Okabe seemed like a unconvincing character. I‚Äôll cut it through
                  it right now: Watching this anime at least twice is essential. Even if you were impressed or unimpressed the first time, watch it again whenever you want. Steins;Gate is an important masterpiece with a leisurely but engaging plot, well-crafted slice-of-life, an inspiring op, a comforting ed, a relatively complex and satisfactory soundtrack, and an interesting lore. If you end up disliking it, I find that to be logical. Humans have been perpetual storytellers for tens of thousands of years, and generations pass down stories entirely different from earlier ones. Yet, they have been fundamentally similar. I‚Äôll argue that you cannot say that for any form of entertainment released the last 18 years or so, since consumer tastes have become increasingly varied and sometimes they can accumulate; such is the case with Steins;Gate. Other stories accumulate more than others, and as a Steins;Gate fan I admit that. Just look at Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood; which currently tops Steins;Gate by a lot and which I am 100% sure is a masterpiece too.",10

                Mind tickling amazing anime. The first episodes might seem pointless and boring but it is worth the wait. It can be the best anime with time travel concept. Astonishing atmosphere is achieved with the help of sounds. Character's motives are realistic and relatable. The story is delicately built. thought of all the little details and the foreshadowings. In my opinion, Steins gate 0 should be watched afterward but the original has better tension and plot.
10/10 anime would watch again.

                Finally finished this one after my 3rd attempt. 
Story 9/10
I want to be very clear that I only gave this a 9 because I felt there were moments (few and far between) that could've been explained better. It took me 3 watches to understand just the first episode. I found myself wondering if I should watch later episodes to get a better grasp of how the time travel thing works. I am so glad I didn't in retrospect, though. Otherwise, the story was amazing. The way this show handled time travel was beyond any other show, movie, game, et cetera I had seen on the
                  subject. Everything is so well thought out that it's believable that this is how time travel would actually work if it was ever accomplished. I can't say much more without going into spoilers.
Art 10/10
There's not a lot I want to say here. The show looks great. I like the attention to detail in some of the backgrounds. There's an episode where Daru goes on a crazy rant and one of the people in the background is actually turning to look at Daru. The characters all look great. My favorites being Makise Kurisu and Suzu (no last name cuz spoilers). Everyone looks the part, you can tell what kind of person Mayuri is just by looking at her. 
Sound 9/10
The opening is great, background music sets the mood and is only there when it needs to be. Most sound effects are impactful and draw you into the show's world. There were a few sounds that made me laugh, but maybe that was the intended effect. 
Character 10/10
Every important character, down to the least important of them, is developed and has conflicts they need to resolve. I actually struggle to pick who the least important character is, because everyone plays a pretty large part in the story at some point. While they all can be reduced to stereotypes, they each have personality traits outside of their base stereotype that distinguish them from characters like say, Kirito from Sword Art Online (who has about as much personality as a Build-A-Bear that's just a normal teddy bear). The characters combined with the excellent story really prove that this anime deserves the high praise it gets from nearly everyone in this community.
Enjoyment 10/10
This show has so many twists and turns it can be confusing to watch. Once you start getting later into the show, more is explained. I started to realize what was going on in earlier episodes as I watched. It breaks lengthy scientific explanations by Makise up with antics from the other characters to get you laughing and ready for another experiment. I was never bored by this show, even when the plot wasn't happening. I barely even noticed when the plot stopped moving because the characters were all so interesting to listen to. 
Overall 10/10
This show had my interest from when I first started watching anime. I hadn't got around to finishing it until now. It was a wild ride, and I felt like I've been through a couple time travel trips myself, but it was a damn fun time. If you are getting into anime, this show is an absolute must watch.",10
"
                Ok, so, I kept myself from watching this before because I thought it seemed boring.... but I was very, very wrong. I decided to watch it last weekend, out of boredom (had nothing better to do); and this, is definitely, one of the best series I have ever watched. It was amazing.At first it may seem like just another silly anime with no good plot at all, but then,it will definitely surprise you. I would also add romance and psychological to genres.
If I had to compare this to another anime, I would say it has some similarities with Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu, but in
                  the real world and not an alternate one, and of course, there is no magic.... Steins;Gate is more sci-fi oriented, as the genres suggests, and it came out first.
The first episode kind of makes no sense, but as the anime goes, every piece is fit in the puzzle.  It has a lot frustrating and painful moments, as well as lovely and playful/funny ones. It's really worth a shot. 
Don't miss this jewel!",10
"
                ‚ÄúTime travelling‚Äù has been popularized and propagated ever since the boom of the sci-fi genre in the mid-1900‚Äôs, and even to this day, this concept is romanticized and is endearing to all of us sci-fi fanatics. 
Steins;Gate, originally a visual novel developed by 5pb and Nitroplus and later adapted to anime, centers around exactly that, the concept of time travelling, or rather time messaging. 
So far, the visual novel, as well as the anime adaptation, has managed to garner critical acclamation by the likes of Anime News Network, giving it an overall rating of A minus.
Given such high appraisals, the release of recent OVA, as
                  well as the announcement for a Steins;Gate movie, the franchise‚Äôs popularity continues to soar like no tomorrow. So it‚Äôs essentially given that this series the perfect epitome of the ideal sci-fi anime then?
Let‚Äôs just get what is right with the anime. 
Story ‚Äì 10
Story in Steins;Gate was exceptional. The show in general was very well written, and fast-paced storyline keeps the viewers anticipating for twists and turns of the anime. However, having said that, the first half of the anime is much more light-hearted and exudes the same relaxed atmosphere that normal slice of life anime tend to have. This is really dependent on personal preferences, but the change in attitude of the anime does tend to be a bit sudden and almost out of place even. Also, the script contains numerous references to 2ch culture/meme, so us English audience will probably gloss over them. 
Art - 9
Art-wise, it‚Äôs fantastic. The subtle grim motif of the art certainly resonates with the rather dramatic mood of the series, and demonstrates high quality animation. To be honest, I prefer the artistic direction that the visual novel took, but the anime is good nonetheless.
Sound - 8
Sound ‚Äì it‚Äôs bloody good. Although I wouldn‚Äôt go far as to call it exceptional, the opening/ending and the OST were all fantastic and the subtle soundtracks could not have been more apt for an anime like Steins;Gate. Same case with the voice acting ‚Äì the voice actors all fitted the personalities of the characters well and they did best to convey the emotions and thoughts. 
Characters - 9
Now the major gripe I have with this anime is the characters. Because this was originally a visual novel, it had routes for all (most of) the females of the anime. You can tell that anime adhered somewhat to this by showing limited interactions between Okabe, who is the main character of our show, with the girls. This might be fine, but these interactions just felt out of place and it felt like the producers simply included it for the sake of the adherence of the plot, rather than for actual characterizations. It might seem a bit formulaic and sort-of visual novel-esque. But besides this weakness, most of the characters are very likeable and very easy to emphasize with. 
Overall ‚Äì 9
Steins;Gate took a clich√©d concept of time travelling, and rehashed it with original setting, cast and story. It stands out as one of the best sci-fi movies to come out in 2011, and in my opinion, one of the best anime to air on that year. If you are a sci-fi watcher like myself, Steins;Gate should be on the top of your watch list. 
p.s. If you did finish watching this series, watch the special episode - Steins;Gate: Oukoubakko no Poriomania, and make sure to play the visual novel if you enjoyed both.",9

                !Spoiler-free review!
Introduction
Time traveling in media is always a weird trope, as there are many different ""kinds"" of time travel with their certain rules. The problem revolving around that is to stick to these rules  over the whole plot, without creating or leaving too many plotholes.
Without giving away to much, Steins;Gate is using a rule-set for time traveling which is rather simple but yet complex. 
Synopsis
The Protagonist of the story is self-appointed mad-scientist Okabe Rintarou, he founded a lab together with his childhood friend and cosplay loving, calm and sweet, but also somewhat airheaded Shiina Mayuri and the perverted, yet skilled hacker Hashida Itaru. 
In
                  this lab they research, invent and build so called ""future gadgets"" and their newest invention is a microwave which leaves food in a questionable stage.
Plot-pace
Steins;Gate manages to explain it's time traveling rules, while introducing new characters over the whole course and still leaves enough time for character development, plot progression and twists. It's a little bit lackluster that certain characters get more attention but it's rather minor regarding the whole wrap-up.
To all those who like to have a proper wrap-up, most all of your questions will be answered  and only very minor question's are left open, only to get answered in other releases and adaptions like OVA's, a movie and of course the original visual novel.
Characters
Steins;Gate doesn't make it difficult to comprehend the actions of the main and supporting cast, while still having a rather large but healthy pool of relevant entities.
Animation and art
People who played original visual novel will find the art very similiar, compressed to fit in properly as an anime. The town-shots are lovely and the usage of dramatic, sad or thrilling effects to underline the situation is naturally and healthy. Steins;Gate character design is very likeable, it's nothing extravagant, but the characters are unique without being unnatural.
Voice Actors(SUB ONLY):
Music
The Soundtrack is catchy and underlines the scenes and situations in a fitting manner. ""Hacking to the Gate"" is spoilerfree as the opening and fits the theme of this anime perfect. ""Toki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku"" is used in the first 22 episodes as the ending and often as a transmission soundtrack while cliffhangers or plottwists occur at the end of an episode, it's successful in building up hype and dramatic feelings. Wonderful√∂
Conclusion
Steins;Gate's anime version is a masterpiece in itself. It's free of plotholes in a very difficult setting, has a lot of likeable and well-developing characters while still keeping up a good pace in plot progression. The Art and Animation is nothing fancy, yet still fantastic and seemless. 
The solution of Steins;Gate should leave you with an saying ""AHA!"", otherwise you weren't paying attention.",10
"
                Simply Awesome. Just... Watch it. No words can simply describe this masterpiece. It is one of the best animes of all times and i personally find it amazing that this anime has extremely little plot holes for a anime on time travelling. Awesome!
              ",10

                This is one of the greatest Time Travel stories ever told in any medium and not just in anime. Its thrilling, sad, funny, not the usual sort of Science Fiction you see nowadays. This anime is the adaptation of the 2009 visual of the same name. Yes, while adapting the visual novel which around 40-50hrs of playtime into 24 eps of anime is a really difficult task and White fox did an amazing job with that. Like obviously Time Travel in this is ""hypothetical"" but the way they explain and present is just amazing.
The most important part of this story are its characters specially the
                  main character ""The Self-Proclaimed Mad Scientist Houonin Kyouma"" Okabe Rintaro. and the main heroine Makise Kurisu who is a genius neuroscience researcher.
So i'm not the biggest fan of this art style as i liked the art of Visual Novel better. Still they did a good job with this too.
I really like the fact that they events that happened irl like John Titor, IBN 5100 (IBM 5100), SERN (CERN), LHC (Large Hadron collider), and actual hypothetical theories like Copenhagen interpretation in Quantum theory, World Lines, Butterfly Effect and many other things for the time travel done in the story.
Some say the start is slow and they drop it but its necessary for the plot because of the world building and characters to get attachted to them. And the pay off in the 2nd half is spectacular.
Its easily my favorite anime of all time and I highly recommend to watch it.",10
"
                I like to have no spoilers in my reviews. Not even character names, or mentioning specific events. So if you simply need someone to convince you to watch this thing, read this.
Oh come on its rated 9.1 average that has to tell you something right?
Okay, lets drop the topic of time travel from the start. As much as it is the driving force behind the entire plot, that isn't why you watch this.
A lot of people miss the fact that this has more in common with tokyo ghoul than something like interstellar. The reason is that the main character is a tragic hero. This story
                  in itself, is one big tragedy, and this isn't even speaking of steins gate zero, the follow up show, which is an even bigger horrific tragedy than the first show.
I want you all to understand that even though the art isn't the ""best"", it fits the bill well. The color choice, the minimalism, the way scenes are cut, its there to create an atmosphere. Enjoy it while the peace lasts.
The sound is also not something that needs to be talked about. It has a very death note vibe, where its there for background, not as something to ""hype up"" a moment or something like a fate sound track. Its here, but the silence during dialogue us much appreciated. What sounds the best though is the bustling city, shinjuku, and akihabara, sound full of life, just like the real thing.
The characters is where it matters. Please, don't just drop this show because one or more of the characters are a bit...weird. Remember, these are all acts. Ways of escapism. Forms of self delusion for the characters to not go utterly insane in what seems to be a rather mundane world until...but once everything goes boom, the masks come off to reveal truly great, simple, and relatable characters, that go back to the fundamentals.
The story, again, is a tragedy. This feels so much more like a Shakespeare take on time travel, rather than something focused on the sci-fi aspect of it all. This truly feels like it was written by a classic lit writer from the 1900's and not that pop culture trash that is pumped out a book a day trying to make the next big best seller list. This is a timeless story about loss, actions and consequences, crime and punishment style.
If you have doubts about watching this because it feels daunting, well...don't. This show really does ease you in to everything. It treats you like a damn baby, holds you by the hand and takes it slow. It does have a LOT of confusing moments, but here is a pro tip. Just go with it, remember it for later.
I hope you do really enjoy this one. Its a show I only watched once, because honestly I can't do it again. Its one of those that you will fear to watch again because of how you will literally get lost in it.",10
"
                The best part about Steins;Gate is that the main character practically did everything, not knowing that all his actions are in vain.
Every timeline must co-exist together, all he has really achieved is migrate his memories from other timelines to the one he likes best.
Combined with the fact that memories are unreliable (psychologically proven), there is no real way to even verify the story happened in the first place. o_O
Definitely the most entertaining anime I've watched about a guy who managed to go through a lot and change very little!
Overlooking the inconsistencies, illogical way of portraying the butterfly effect and time in general, the anime is
                  entertaining, well made, and well structured. The characters show more development than otherwise possible because of ability to replay history.
Since dreams supposedly show events from alternative timelines, the main character's dreams show a very clear message. Don't screw around with time, it's not worth it for insane people.
PS: Episode 25 is a must watch!",10
"
                The greatest take on time travel and one of the greatest TV shows ever. Also, my all time favorite love story.
Such an epic, I had a marathon of this on a Saturday took me 8 hours to complete all the 24 episodes, the best 8 hours of my life. This is an anime which makes me want to create fake accounts and write reviews and rate it 10/10 over and over again. Damn I just couldn't stop watching, so addictive every episode, no even the OVAs and specials are filled with world class quality. In my opinion, the word perfection has been created for a
                  TV show like this. And such a beautiful love story I just can't get enough of Okabe and Makise, for me, this the best love story I've seen or read or heard and trust me I've seen many movies and TV shows, this is the best love story ever followed by Jon Snow and Ygritte from Game OF Thrones. At first I've seen this on myanimelist and I thought this would be another complex brainy anime, but when I watched Steins;Gate I couldn't believe it this anime has everything, complex elements, love story, humor, nostalgia, adventure, strategy and it takes you on a journey  with them if you watch it on a marathon. The ending was so perfect I just couldn't stop crying as if this was a TV show I've been watching for 10 years, 24 hours have passed and the feels still keep hitting me.
I just want a sequel of this, about 33 years old Okabe. I finally suggest you one thing, take a day off, download a high quality package of Steins;Gate including all the OVAs, special and the movie, and watch it in a marathon with English subtitles only (Dub is horrible) and trust me you'll have the best time in your life. Better than any high or trip a drug gives you. And my final statement being,
""Steins;Gate is one of the greatest TV shows""
Thank you, have fun.",10
"
                Greetings, this may be YET another Steins;Gate review from the many users that were captivated by the magic; that is Steins Gate.
I just finished the series for the very first time. My thoughts? ""Believe The Hype"". I have seen so much praises for this anime and had high expectation for it. Turned out to be more than what i expected.
In summary, the show is about time travel. It has a really good story line, mixed in with comedy, romance, friendship and hardship. There is nothing quite like it :D
Some people might be put off by the sci fi theme, but i assure you, there is
                  so much more to it. It does however have a rather slow start that may lead viewers to drop it. 
This review might not give you much insight on the anime itself. But i believe the magic of steins gate should not be revealed here. Go on and give this anime a try(if you haven't already). You may not like it as much as me 10/10, but i guarantee it'll be a great experience. 
#This is my first review:D. Any constructive criticism is more than welcome!",10
"
                Warning: This show does not live up the hype, in other words, this is utterly disappointing.
Okay okay this review of course is based on my preference so if you find it useful, then thanks. If u are an avid fan, I already considered the possibility that u might be mad about this honest review, anyway, idgaf.
I am not a veteran anime watcher nor a die hard fan of the sort. Actually, this is my first review here so let's get started.
I am one of those curious individuals who are intrigued by the fact that this show skyrocketed to the 3rd spot in the most highly
                  rated shows in MAL, so that's it, that's the reason why I tried watching this show. The first few episodes were somewhat SLOW-PACED. Watching this feels like doing a chore, the repetitive elements (which is actually essential in this genre) are not executed so well, this turned out to be boring as helI. For analogy, this feels like reading a book that isn't page-turner, in short, this isn't binge worthy. In fact, I watched this in 1.25x speed (which I seldomly do in watching anime series). 24 episodes feel so lengthy for me. I almost dropped this show, but somehow I still continued watching this. Not worth the time ngl.",7
"
                The concept of time travel and how it was utilized was very intriguing, the presentation of how one can  time travel with help of neuroscience helped me determine the better parts of this anime. 
The sound track opening is fairly good. A number of fans say the second half is where the anime started, I think otherwise. 
The intro is what really made it, and perhaps it's just me, but the second half feels more like a recollection, thus not much new happening. The Story at it's bases it falls apart like any other time travel stories. Certain parts of the anime are abstract
                  and seem like they are driving the story elsewhere but is never mentioned again. The plot is pretty easy to predict about half way through, the ending is very unsatisfying.
Character developments are visible, but to a limited few, other characters feel like fill ins and in this anime plot armor is probably the thickest I've ever seen; so thick if the universe collapsed they probably are still alive. Unfortunately most of this anime's development derives from fill that overall detract from the anime. 
Overall I do think this anime has less filler than most of the ones out there, but it's story isn't much better. If you seek an interesting interpretation of time travel and don't mind the filler and plot wholes, this is definitely something to watch once at least.",6
"
                Steins Gate, The Summit.
Well, after having seen Steins Gate, and seeing first hand that it is an absolute failure as an anime, I will proceed to do an autopsy of why this anime has failed.
First of all, Steins Gate is the perfect example of being an anime with a fairly decent and even interesting story, but it is shattered by its horrible strategy of telling it. In other words, the Steins Gate narrative is horrible because of its complicated way of telling it.
Secondly, Steins Gate fails as it intentionally lengthens, as well as unnecessarily, the plot, the first eleven chapters being totally irrelevant, insubstantial and
                  unsustainable. So they can be summarized in 4 chapters, and even in 3 if you rush me.
Third, the Steins Gate characters are irritating, irrelevant, pointless, and exhausting. Steins Gate makes the very serious mistake of picking up and saying: Here, this is Gordo, he is a hacker, and ale palante. No, it is a mistake to offer a template of characters without any basis to understand where they come from and what their objective is. All in all, Steins Gate presents a series of irritating and irrelevant characters for the plot that only lengthen it unnecessarily. For that reason, the personage who takes the prize to the irrelevance would be Mayuushi, or as I call it, Tutur√∫.
Furthermore, it features a well organized and built character, Makise Kurisu. His story as an anime character is interesting, coherent and makes you want to appear more in the anime. Therefore, he is the only redeemable character in the anime.
Fourth, Steins Gate is an anime with one of the worst animations I've ever seen in my entire life. I have never seen characters with such muted colors, so much so that it seems that the painter was poorer than the 19th century railroad investors.
Fifth, Steins Gate offers a variety of comic scenes. To be honest, I will have laughed in one or two scenes. However, I have laughed many times throughout the anime, though not the comedy, but how awful Steins Gate is as an anime.
Finally, I conclude that this anime fails because its creator gives himself an air of greatness and intends to mix a lot of elements in an order that results in absolute disaster. In other words, its creator is a full-blown Kojima. Also, an anime has never bored me as much as this one, of the 24 episodes, the only ones that can be rescued are the last two. In the rest I affirm here and now that I have been looking at my mobile 75% of the time of how boring it was.
For all this, and for more, I can conclude that Steins Gate is a stew that mixes a lot of things, the result of which is one of the worst anime I've ever seen. If they had been removed from the 24 episodes, between 12 and 15, so that the story had to be told in a more accelerated way, it would probably be a much better anime. But instead, the creator decided to include a bunch of totally irrelevant arcs, plots, characters, and scenes for the series. For this reason, as I said at the beginning of my analysis, Steins Gate is The Summit, of insubstantiality.",3
"
                I dropped this at 10 episodes and this is why:
The main character is eccentric. The side characters are quirky. The plot involves changing the present by affecting the past. This sounds like a good recipe to be at least -interesting- even if each of its ingredients could use some work.
But it never became interesting to me. The presentation is flat, the art is drab, the dialog is mostly just ramblings that do not move the story forward. The thing I disliked most was the characters. They talk in this weird, plastic, fake conversational way that just comes off as uncanny. 
A lot of people like
                  this, so maybe the best was yet to come. Watch if you liked Sonny Boy, slow-burn stories, and want more of a think-piece than most anime. I don't think this is a bad show, but it failed to grab my attention.",4
"
                Ok this anime is not really a masterpiece since I already saw several time travel stories in the past. Well for people that are new to anime would definitely be amazed about steins;gate and the idea about time travel but for me it's old school. My review is that this anime has no originality I noticed that episodes 12-14 was taken from the 2002 movie time machine and episodes 16-18 was taken from dragon ball z (future trunks)""No spoiler in my review"".. There is really nothing special about this anime but I enjoyed it somehow. Well overall it's like a modified version of dragon ball
                  z cell saga and 2002 film time machine the author did well but it wasn't good enough and he got no originality. Overall rating: 8",8
"
                Steins;Gate is an excellent show that I have tried no less than four times to watch over the years, but have never found myself able to get past the 3-episode mark. Now, having finally decided to watch the Dub instead of the Sub (More on this blasphemy later) I can honestly say its a near perfect anime marred only by its extremely slowly paced first five episodes.
Story-wise, Stein;Gate is fantastic. Its a very internally consistent universe, important for any hard sci-fi series such as this, and once the ball gets rolling it is very, very hard to peel your eyes away. Tense mysteries and conspiracies
                  build up to a nearly seven-episode long payoff that then proceeds to out-do itself. After hitting episode twelve, the intrigue hits a fever pitch and doesn't settle back down until the finale. Okabe's romance sub-plot is done so subtlely and manages to work into one of the show's biggest hype moments so well that I'm hard-pressed to find any problems with it. Where most shows buckle under the pressure of balancing both a science fiction adventure with a romance, Steins;Gate makes it an integral part of the plot. The only problem then, is the five episodes before anything actually happens. Episodes one through five are all character building and light-hearted comedy, with only the barest of hints at whats to come. This is common in Visual Novels, as its important to build up a player's attachment to the characters before forcing them to choose routes, but in an anime its hardly needed. While the five episode build up is funny and entertaining, it is most certainly the weakest link here, and would've been a welcomed cut.
The art is gorgeous. At once realistic and otherworldly, Steins;Gate makes excellent use of lighting to portray an otherwise normal portrayal of Akihabara as somewhere between a desert paradise and a purgatorial nightmare. All of the characters look distinct to one another, avoiding the same-face dilemma that even great shows run into from time to time. In addition to this, the character's appearances say a lot about who they are as a person. From the endearing naivety of Mayuri to the porcelain grace of Kurisu, to the withdrawn beauty of Ruka, each of the character's designs do wonders to establish who these characters are before they've even said a word. Its worth noting that while some of this comes from the original visual novel, and due credit should be paid to it, some of the mystique does come from the production studio. The best example is Kurisu; in the visual novel, she and Okabe have a fairly similar skin tone, while in the anime Kurisu is considerably paler than every other character in the show. Changes like these are for the better, and add a lot to already wonderful designs.
The soundtrack for this series is great, even though that rarely weighs into my opinion of the show. In particular, both the OP and ED do a excellent job of setting the tone and being extremely enjoyable to listen to on their own. Its just a shame that when you marathon the series, you're most likely going to skip right past them. In all other cases, the soundtrack is used extremely sparingly. Most of the time, the most startling and excellently used track is pure silence, adding once again to the sense of realism this show manages to convey.
Alright, now to justify my choice of Dub vs. Sub. Yes, the Sub has several absolutely hilarious scenes of Okabe making an ass of himself. Yes, the Engrish is very funny. Yes, the Japanese voice cast is great. So why dub? Well the choice is easy due to the first five episodes: Hououin Kyouma. In the English dub, ""Kyouma"" manages to come across as eccentric but obviously false, adding to depth of Okabe's character from the very first episode. In the original Japanese, however, ""Kyouma"" manages to sound like a recent lobotomy patient with marbles in his mouth. Considering how often the Kyouma voice is used in the first five episodes (Read, all the motherfucking time) the Kyouma act gets real old real fast, and I can't blame anyone for dropping the show during the first five episodes, and if you have done so in the past I implore you: Watch the Dub. The Dub's cast is amazing too, not a wrongly cast character in the bunch, every line delivered with rich coarseness that betrays the characters inner thoughts, and Trina Nishimura is an amazing voice actress who has a criminally small list of roles considering how fantastic she is.
Characters are great. I'm not gonna spoil it, watch it yourself if you really want to know. Ruka and Kurisu tie for best girl. Most of the fun of the show is unraveling how these characters think and watching them grow. Watching Kurisu and Okabe's relationship change and grow closer even across world lines that Kurisu shouldn't remember is fantastic and my favorite part of the show.
All in all, if the show were to abridge the first five episodes down to one and a half, this would be a perfect show. If you can make it past the slow as hell first five episodes, Steins;Gate is one of the all time greats.
(Don't forget to watch the OVA follow up if you want closure to the main romance. Also don't watch the movie, it blows.)",9

                Really interesting story, but I wouldn't say Steins;Gate is a masterpiece.
There's a good story here, underneath the mess of all the ideas the creators threw together that didn't fit together so well. In a nutshell, seems like the creators thought that the combination of time travel, inevitable death, and upholding the meaning of 'nakama' would be enough to carry this anime (and I guess it worked and it's made it to the top) but it doesn't stand out. Characters and animation are bland and story was pretty much predictable once they finally unveiled more about the anime. Story was complicated and deep. But not enough.
                  
I get that time travel means you have everything working against you, but it was weird that they made the antagonist SEVERAL characters, all ambiguous. You have SERN, FB, Chris's dad, and it's almost like the writers used them all to create suspense and when it came time to explain these villainous characters, the writers couldn't deliver. What happened to the assassins? oh, they're not important right now. What the heck was up with Kiryuu Moeka - they didn't give us a clear backstory on her. Oh? she works for a sketchy organization that we're not even gonna learn shit about? 
Overall, it's a good watch. Takes long for things to pick up.",7

                Honestly the best anime I have ever watched. After thinking over it for a few weeks I still strongly feel that its perfect. I have gone through SOOOOOOOOOOOO many animes but Steins Gate has caused me to feel more emotions I have ever felt for an anime. At times I was left speechless, glad, sad and even at a point I teared up a little. MASTER PIECE! I DONT GIVE A FUCK WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAYS! 
Anyways Steins Gate clicked all the boxes of what i'm in love with and the story, characters that come with it are also great. Basically a quick summary is
                  that Mr. Mad Scientist finds how to mess with time and does alot of stuff he shouldn't. 
For an anime thats released in 2011 its pretty high quality and is much better then some of the more recently released ones. If it was released today in 2020 I can't imagine how good it could have been. It's a shame that it was released so soon. 
Also every time I listen to ""Hacking to the Gate"" op I can't help from feeling the original emotions I had watching the anime in the first place. 
It's high placement is a %100 deserved it is much better then classics like Naruto, Akame Ga Kill, Food Wars, and on par or above Hunter x Hunter and Code Geas",10
"
                after rewatching the series for the 15th time i think its time to write a review about it.
While it is true that time travel anime primarily tend to have weak storytelling and a lot of plot holes, i can definitely say that steins;gate is one of few exceptions to that.
 Story: 10
the story is about okabe rintaro, a self proclaimed mad scientist who is obsessed with ""future gadget lab"" which is basically a wannabe lab with two of his friends - daru, the super hacker, and mayuuri his childhood friend. 
the first few episodes are kinda slow and might turn you down, but everything changes
                  when we find out that one of their creations, the ""phone microwave"" can send messages to the past and alter the course of time, a truly tempting but scary power to have. after this the story becomes very engaging, we watch okabe use the power to save his friends and escape from an organization called cern who are actually developing the first time machine in the world for their selfish purposes. there's a lot of building up to the very satisfying ending to the anime that will most likely leave you wanting to witness it again for the first time.
 art: 8
this is the part where steins;gate is lacking the most, considering that the series didn't have a huge budget going in, its not top notch, but that doesn't mean that its bad either. the art is pretty good and what's important, it manages to depict the atmosphere very well. also it has a much more realistic feel compared to most of other anime out there. 
 sound: 8
an amazing opening, very good voice acting, good sound effects. even though we can not compare it to the background sounds of something like kizumonogatari and such, its still pretty decent and does not disappoint in any way.
 characters: 10
characters in steins;gate are all very unique, interesting, with pretty good stories, good visuals and interesting characteristics + they have a character for everyone. theres kurisu - a tsundere, daru - the nerd, mayuuri - the airheaded girl, feris - a cat girl kinda. there's even ruka, if ure into traps. the characters are written in such fashion that you are bound to like them, hence i found one of my fav characters ever, kurisu in this anime.
there's not a lot of character development for these characters, except for okabe who undergoes some drastic changes throughout the story and these changes are conveyed so well that it makes you form a deep emotional bond with the character. 
 enjoyment: 10
im pretty greedy with 10s but steins gate is one of those few shows that managed to snatch it from me, the main reasons being the amazing story AND whats very important for me - rewatch value. the first time you rewatch the series you'll be astounded at how many things u perceive differently and how many foreshadowing and hints there are for all the events that take place later in the story. with every rewatch you will most definitely notice something new and that kind of storytelling makes this show truly a masterpiece. 
 overall: (if its not already obvious) 10
steins;gate is a show which i think will be loved by most of the viewers who manage to get trough the first few episodes and actually get to the end of the story, and even tho not everyone will feel that emotional attachment to characters or the story i feel, i find it hard to believe that someone would actually think that this anime is bad (without being biased).
 and that sums my review up, hope you enjoy this emotional rollercoaster wrapped into the mind blowing sucession of events that is Steins;gate.",10
"
                When I had seen only the first 6 or 7 episodes of Steins;Gate, I was already loving it, so I rated it only 9 (great). However, after seeing it until the end, I had no choice but to be mad at myself for such a low rating, and immediately changed it to 10 (outsdanding), just because there's nothing above 10/10. I found out that an anime that was initially funny, interesting and a bit dramatic could become, lately, a true masterpiece. When I finished seeing it, I just tought: ""OK, Steins;Gate is over. Life has no sense anymore..."" Well, maybe a little less radical.
Very good
                  plot based on the idea of time travel. A intelligent story that doesn't take too long and fits well on the 24 episodes (even though more would be better). 
Good occasional gags. Although it's not centered on the humor, it has some very funny parts. The main character, Kyouma, is often confused and creating conspiracy theories, generating good jokes. His treatment to other people, despising them and often calling wrong names and not worrying about anybody‚Äôs feelings, is also a great way to create jokes. The main female character, Mayushii, is captivating in her cute, innocent way (similar to Taneshima Poplar from ""Working!!"", but Mayushii never gets angry). Other characters also have important participation on what happens lately in the anime.
The emotional development in the anime is very important and tends to increase when things get more and more complicated. The problems created by the wrong use of the time machine (and by the interference of a worldwide known organization with secret plans) may cause unexpected and irreversible consequences...
The story has casual references to movies and culture related to time machines and does a good job on inserting science in the plot without making it tiresome. Starts making you confused about what's going on, but lately explaining the phenomena seen during the evolution of the plot. Also does a good job on describing the time paradoxes and other problems that happen due to the changes in time and space caused by the time machine. Amazing anime, worth seeing.",10

                Well Iv never really done this review thing. i'm a new member to this site, but i'v been An anime fan for years I just chose now to make an MAL. So anyway, Steins;Gate was a fantastic show and that's coming from someone who is a big Doctor Who fan. The story behind Steins;Gate is creative in my perspective. I have to say tho I almost gave up on this show because the story did not seem to be going anywhere till the 8th episode, But i'm so glad I forced myself to stick with it because it kept on getting better and batter. The
                  choices that Okabe had to make where heart pounding. And The last episode was not disappointing at all which was another plus in my book. I recommend this show to be on your list. ^_^ 
Ps- Doctor Who fans, There are to Reverences concerning the TARDIS. Just thought I would put that out there ^_^v",9
"
                Having just finished a can of crisp Dr. Pepper, and with it, the final episode of Steins;Gate, now seems like a good time to do a comprehensive review, having seen everything this has to offer. And oh boy, what a ride it was. 
STORY (7): Steins;Gate's story is, at its core, fairly simple and straightforward. Okabe Rintarou, our lovable mad scientist and basket case, constructs ""Future Gadgets"" using ordinary household items. Well, he and his friends run into some problems in regards to this, big and small, that fuel the story's progression. Early on, S;G may seem slow and could appear to some viewers as
                  a slice-of-life with a silly, conspiracy theory obsessed nerd as its protagonist. Rest assured, it is not, and things really pick up later in the series. The first few episodes serve their purpose, introducing main characters and setting up situations, humorous and dramatic, that clue us into their personalities. They are good stories in their own right, and provide comic relief to contrast with the plot heavy stuff that occurs later on. The story is not spectacular and may leave the viewer with a few questions lingering, but, in general, explanations of certain occurrences were plausible in-universe. And, by god, it sure is edge-of-my-seat entertaining.
ART (8): The art in S;G does the story and characters justice. It is definitely above average. Settings are rendered nicely, and while the character design may not be as intricate as in other series, the producers did not appear to take short cuts. It's simple in some areas, but pretty to look at.
SOUND (7): The sound department here did a pretty good job. The OP and ED are awesome songs that set up a good vibe for the show. Early on, there is very little BGM present; the sound of cicadas--a bit cliche I will admit--permeates the atmosphere during many outdoor scenes. Some very nice piano pieces add to the mood in the later episodes. Overall, not a bad at all.
CHARACTER (7): Characterization is fairly well done in S;G. Over the course of the show, I found myself attached to certain characters, and despising others. This is indicative of the good work on part of the writers. Okabe will be likable to many viewers, probably in large part due to this eccentricities. Mayuri and Itaru play the part of loyal friends, while Kurisu occupies a stereotypical tsundere role, but this doesn't necessarily stop one from sympathizing with her. I wish a few received more screen time or had their backstories expanded upon, but it didn't detract too much from my enjoyment.
Overall (8): I was introduced to Steins;Gate very late--late August, in fact--and entered with many reservations. My first impression, based on what I had heard from the spiritual prequel Chaos;Head...well, suffice it to say I was dead wrong. Following this series has been the most enjoyable part of the summer season, if not the entire year's. Steins;Gate comes highly recommended from me. Give it try; who knows, you might be surprised, just like I was.",8
"
                Steins; Gate is an anime all about time travel, seems like a simple, and overused concept. Let me just tell you, if the normal view of time travel is an apple. This is a strawberry that is thousands times bigger and better. 
First, the story. Magnificently written, and honestly the only problem was that is was ""going too slow"" and that's never a bad thing. Stories should always go at the author's pace, otherwise it seems too rushed or too slow.
The art wasn't anything special, however it was better than average.
The sound and voice acting specifically was amazing. The character is portrayed in the voice,
                  which I have never seen in any anime except a select few.
The characters are just great, even if some may fall into a trough, that's not always bad. It's like how there are troughs in art making, you can't avoid them without making something good. And that's how I feel about this.
I enjoyed this so much, I wish I could give it a 1000/1. Seriously.
Overall, this anime has everything positive. Personally, I'm not big into time travel, but this anime I have enjoyed more than any other. This anime has changed my life, and it's hard for something to do that. Judge for yourself whether you should watch this show, I HIGHLY recommend it.",10
"
                1.21 gigawatts! Great Scott! ‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù is a 2010 sci-fi anime directed by Takuya Sato and Hiroshi Hamasaki and tells the story of self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintaro Okabe, or otherwise known by his alias ‚ÄúHououin Kyouma‚Äù (proceed with air guitar), as he one day accidentally invents a time machine with his microwave that can send text messages into the past. Together with his team, consisting of Mayuri Shiina, a young girl with an annoying catch phrase, Itaru Hashida, a fat otaku who‚Äôs actually a brilliant hacker, and the newest member of the lab, Kurisu Makise, who‚Äôs basically Okabe‚Äôs right-hand woman in science, they must uncover many
                  hidden and dark secrets about time travel and deal with the shocking consequences that come with it.
Now chances are that I‚Äôve already lost most of you by saying it‚Äôs a time travel show. Understandably, time travel is a very tricky concept to pull off in a narrative sense, and sometimes, you‚Äôll have to settle for a complete suspension of disbelief to really appreciate all that it has to offer. Well, I can say with full assurance that ‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù is in a league of its own. What makes ‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù so incredibly riveting is the fact that it treats its risky subject matter with surprisingly solid realism, so you don‚Äôt have to suspend any disbelief. It actually makes time travel seem somewhat plausible, and I loved that aspect about the show. It stuck to its own logic and it definitely paid off. However, with a good time travel concept, you need a range of wacky characters, and trust me when I say, you won‚Äôt find any protagonist as maniacally crazy as Okabe‚Ä¶ oh, I‚Äôm sorry. Hououin Kyouma! (sonuvabitch). He‚Äôs probably the most fun and interesting main character I‚Äôve seen in anime in quite some time, and has extremely likable charms about him, despite being about as mad as a hatter. His character arc throughout the show is surprisingly solid, and you really feel the weight of his consequences when something goes wrong. And trust me, plenty of things go off the rails in this show, as it throws one twist after another like curveballs. The next character I‚Äôd like to mention is Kurisu, who‚Äôs one of the strongest female characters I‚Äôve seen in anime too. Like Okabe, she‚Äôs more or less borderline crazy, but tends to keep her composure more, and shares quite a burning passion for science. And like Okabe, as things progress, she begins to open up more and more, hence we have what is, in my opinion, a very satisfying chain of events and certain key romantic moments. That‚Äôs another aspect that took me unexpectedly, is that during the second half of the show, romance is revealed as the driving force between Okabe‚Äôs actions, and its executed rather well.
I won‚Äôt dive into any of the other characters for fear of spoiling some things, but I‚Äôll just say that this group is probably the most likable bunch of dimwit airhead geniuses to come out of entertainment since Doogie Houser himself. I can‚Äôt talk about ‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù without at least mentioning the technical aspects, apart from the brilliant writing and characters. The animation is something really special, and at times, feels so high-quality and crisp, that you can‚Äôt help but let your jaw drop, especially in some sequences when Okabe begins to travel back into time, and what we get is an acid trip reminiscent of ‚Äú2001: A Space Odyssey‚Äù. It complements the time travel aspects especially well, and sucks you in and can leave you shaking on the edge of your seat too. Also noteworthy is the soundtrack. ‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù has some beautifully composed pieces that can set the mood. However, there‚Äôs only a few tracks that really stand out for me, one of them being a piano ballad which for the life of me I cannot seem to remember the title of the song. But what compensates for the lack of great musical numbers here and there is the opening and closing credits. Usually, I skip over opening and closing credits, or rather just watch the opening credits and skip the closing credits and vice versa, but for ‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù, they‚Äôre especially great and probably one of the few openings you‚Äôll most likely never (ever) get sick of hearing and watching.
‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù is damn well close to being a masterpiece, but it is a riveting show that earns its title for being one of the best modern anime to come out, probably in the last 10 years. Thanks to its colorful cast of characters, including Hououin Kyouma! (sonuvabitch) and Kurisu, a spectacularly well-written story, great animation and music, and a fresh, unique spin on the time travel concept, it‚Äôs one show that won‚Äôt be leaving your mind long after its over. If only I had a microwave that sends text messages into the past so I could tell myself to not watch this, just so I can watch it with a clean slate again. But of course, according to ‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù logic, stick a banana in a microwave and it may cause the apocalypse. I‚Äôm not even kidding.",10
"
                I first heard about this anime from a friend, who couldn't stop praising it. I looked it up on Wikipedia and it's plot seemed intriguing, so I thought heck, let's give this a shot. 
Well...it IS a good anime, but only after the first 11 episodes. After watching the first episode I had no idea what was going on, but I stuck through it due to word of mouth from my friend and how this was supposed to be one of the top-rated anime of 2011.
Around episode 11, the pace finally picked up, and the story got very exciting and engaging and didn't let up
                  until the end of the series. The series' plot is well-done science fiction, and it reminded me of classic sci-fi films such as Back to the Future. There weren't any significant logic holes or plotholes of that sort.
The artwork was great, the OP and EDs were good too, and the characters were all likable, and each had their own charms and quirks. 
Thinking back on retrospect, I feel like the first 11 episodes could have been condensed into just 5 episodes, as I didn't really enjoy the same repeating jokes a few of the characters make amongst another, and this happened a LOT, and as a result, took up a lot of screen time.
So overall, I give this series a 7. If it wasn't for the uneven and super slow pacing, I would easily rate this a 9.",7
"
                This has to be the most overrated show I've ever watched it's insane, the first half of the anime is pretty much slice of life and slice of life heavily relies on characters and that's the thing the characters are bad.. just BAD. The second half is where the show is starting to get ''crazy''.. tbh if u got over 70 IQ the show is pretty predictable for you to enjoy.
Characters 2/10 :  Mayuri is just a plot device, Kurisu is a tsundere and Itaru is just a boring computer nerd. The main character Okabe was the only interesting character for me. They barely
                  have any character development how tf can anybody whether u like the show or not give the characters a good score unless ur trolling.
Story 3/10 : The show first episode is very confusing/interesting it will most likely hook you, and then after episode 2 or 3 it just turns into boring slice of life as i said, the second half is just not good enough to make up for the boring first half of the anime. This is really sad considering that the greatest thing about this show is the story and it's not really that good i don't know what people are smoking. 
Art 5/10 : bearable don't really care about art as long as the show is good.
Overall 3/10 : at least i'm no longer curious why Steins gate is considered one of the greatest anime out there. It's just simply overrated.",3
"
                The best completed show I've watched so far, 
with an incredible narrative featuring scifi mystery, thriller as well as slife of life elements.
The plot takes you on an emotional rollercoaster and does each tone it wants to convey very well whether that be light hearted or serious.
The characters are insanely likeable and make you want to see more of them interacting due to their chemistry with one another.
The soundtrack is also very memorable and still makes me emotional to this day.
If you haven't seen this one or read the VN, I envy you, because you can watch this going in without knowing anything.
closest to 10/10 there will be for me.",10
"
                Steins Gate published on 2011, and i just watched in 2017. Well that's a big leap of late i can say but tbh this anime is the best from all anime that i've been watching. It makes me wanna watch it over and over again. With their comedies, thrilling, and sci-fi reach my top favorite anime so far. Hoping its not too late for me to review this masterpiece anime.
A mad scientist with a type of a guy that goes happy go lucky, Okabe Rintarou aka Hououin Kyouma!, felt in love with Makise Kurisu's charm aka ""Christinaaaa"", the cuteness overload Shiina Mayuri ""Tootooroo, Mayushii desu"",
                  and the super talented ""hax0r"" guy Itaru Hashida aka Daru. Felt warm with them joking around in the lab. Hoping that there will be a new season of them to carry out their Super genius Future Gadgets name. Although i watched 4 extra episodes and of course the movie itself. But it's not yet satisfied. :(
Pls give me some anime recommendation to cure this dilemma Steins Gate of mine. That's all. El Psy Congroo. Tootooroo",10
"
                Steins;gate, at first glance, seems to be more complex than it really is, with extremely charismatic characters, Kuristina, Houhouin Kyouma and many others.
I admit that in my first attempts to watch, I dozed off about three times, but when I got involved in the story, it was a marathon watching two to three times to try to get everything down to the smallest detail. It's a wonderful piece that everyone should give a chance, even if they don't like it at first or just find it boring.
El psy congroo!
Story: Very well developed and resolved, how things fit together makes it much nicer to review, as
                  small details not seen before now reveal themselves and make the replay factor interesting.
Art & Sound: The overall design is simple but very unique and beautiful (Ps Kurisu, goddess of my heart), all the respective work to the sound, just divine and by far the Disquiet song, is my favorite from OST, leaving me restless, anxious and afraid.
Characters: ""I'm a mad scientist, son of a bitch"". ""Tuturu, Okarinnn!!"". ""Eternity is not infinite. Even though time expands to the eternal, there is still an end."" I love them all it happens.
Enjoyment: As I said, sleep a few times while trying like this, but once I was hooked by the work, I easily watched it about 4 times, so I had so fucking fun.
Overall: My favorite anime, it's wonderful, watch it.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is not just one of the best anime series out there, but one of the best Science Fiction series I've seen in general. All of the positive things you've heard about it are true. It's like one of the best Twilight Zone episodes, exploring how regular people would react to an incredible event. 
The characters are without a doubt the best part of the show. Every one of them is developed well, and by the end you feel very invested in their story. They all have unique personalities and quirks. They're not defined by those traits, however, and each develop throughout the series. Okabe
                  and Makise are definitely the best. They react to the time travel realistically, with both fascination and fear. They're relationship with the other characters and each other develops naturally, and is honestly one of my favorite parts of the show.
The story itself is also great. The way time travel works is unique, having a lot of different rules and possible unforeseen problems, which is to be expected of any good time traveling setup. There are a lot of twists and turns, but without getting too hard to follow. Like any great science fiction story, it doesn't just focus on the fantastical events, but also on how characters react to them and how it effects society.
The only real downside of the series is that the first 8 or 9 episodes are a bit slow. They are still interesting, and necessary for setting up the characters, but it was a bit boring at first. That is a minor problem, however, as those episodes are still enjoyable. Overall, this is a great anime.",10
"
                Steins; Gate is an amazing anime. A reductive take on this show is that its just another time travel thriller, but that is far from the case.
First off, the show does time travel very uniquely and has a, for the most part, fleshed out set of rules and internal logic for its time travel mechanics. It's takes a lot of looks at wiki pages and comments to fully grasp the way it works and there are even theoretical situations where the answer to what would happen is still uncertain, but the great thing is that we can approach these situations given our knowledge of the
                  methods of time travel. 
As you know, there are three methods: DMail, Time-leap, and physical time travel. Not gonna go in detail, but the way they interact with worldline divergence, causality, and the point of view of characters (ie: okabe's reading steiner objectivity clashing against the changes to the those around him) brilliantly maps out an expansive timeline that goes beyond just this anime and into other source materials from science adventure.
Anyway, if you're not the type to get bogged down by all those details, it's absolutely fine because steins; gate is VERY strong emotionally. This ain't your tenet thriller with cold Nolan dialog and only spectacle to offer. I think tenet had pretty good mechanics and allowed for imaginative scenarios, but that lacked the visceral emotion of steins; gate. That's one of the things that allows for Stein to stick out; the implications of time travel, playing the role of God, and how the fate unveils on characters like Mayuri and Kurisu. It's truly tragic, and the importance of memory is so very much considered and a strong theme (esque of Memento). 
Welp, after those general notes, let's get more into each of my sub categories:
Story - It's just outstanding. Yes everyone talks about the first 12 episodes being boring and mid, and the counterargument is that they do set up juxtaposition with the later episodes. But, moreover, the episodes within themselves give great vibes of uncovering mysteries and casual chilling out with friends.
Art - Visual direction is actually really good. Y'all probably heard already how it captures hot summers and the sound of cicadas cause its in Japan. I only put 8 because there are animes that are just really good and better, not necessairly that stein was lacking significantly
Sound - Sound gets the job done in the show. There are a few significant ones but generally it's just how sounds should be. Lyrical music is phenomenal.
Character - Stein has a few really good characters I would say. Okabe is really good, Kurisu is too, Mayuri is fine too. Daru and the others get the job done, but aren't really complex. So I give it a 9.
Enjoyment - Really enjoyable, not much else",10
"
                Overall 10 - tl;dr Steins;Gate is pretty good. I'd recommend it, and imo I don't think the first 12 episodes are slow.
Stein's; Gate is a show, anything I say to praise it has probably been said thousands of times but I wanted to get a brief take out there. Honestly getting into it and watching the story play out is one of the best parts of seeing it for the first time so I'll reduce this review to nothing but the breakdown of components.
Story 10 - One of the best uses of the Sci-Fi genre, some say it takes a while to build up, however
                  I personally disagree. The first 12 episodes are not slow in my opinion and leave the viewer with many questions before being flung into the next 12.
Art 8 - The original visual novel has a rather striking style to it and it lost some luster when adapted into an anime, however I have no complaints. It could have been better, however there are no real flaws.
Sound 8 - The music is pretty decent and the main theme is a great leitmotif that is used throughout the show. One complaint is the excessive usage of 'Japanese Summer sounds' i.e. Cicadas. 
Character 10 - Hououin Kyouma is an amazing protagonist and the supporting cast is excellent. In terms of realism, some events and character backgrounds aren't entirely grounded in conceivable reality, however this does not detract from their execution.
Enjoyment 10 - I am a big fan of Sci-Fi and Steins;Gate is, in my opinion, the best at what is sets out to achieve.",10

                - English Review (Translated version)
""Steins;Gate"" is probably one of the best anime ever made. It's a story of science fiction, time travel and butterfly effects. Normally these ingredients are usually mixed  pretentiously and pompously in this type of productions, but here not, here everything goes in a natural, simple, ""around the house"". And contrary to what may seem at first, that adds up instead of subtracting.
In large part this is thanks to a group of great characters, where each and every one of them are perfectly defined and are evolving in a way that empathizes with them chapter by chapter. All of them. And
                  that's not easy to get.
Beginning with the protagonist, Okabe Rintar≈ç (Okarin for his friends, Hououin Kyouma for himself), with whom he has to overcome the barrier he creates at the beginning due to his histrionics, that malevolent laugh, that fakes phone calls (although everyone believes true in the first five minutes of series, confess) and all its peculiarities, but then becomes the perfect protagonist of this story. Without forgetting, of course, the lovely Mayuri, and Kurisu (-tina), who apart from being a brave and intelligent character gives us the romantic point of the story. Even slightly more minor characters, but not less important, as Suzuha (a mine of script spins), Daru or the strange Ruka.
It is true that ""Steins; Gate"" begins in a very disconcerting way, with a twisted structure from the beginning that causes the first three chapters (more or less) ended and you are not even minimally located in what your eyes are seeing. They could have been something more clear and explicit with the plot at the beginning, although it can not be denied that it is also part of the charm of the series (especially given its theme), that confusion and the tying of ends little by little.
Except for this and perhaps an excessively marked division into two parts (between introduction and action/solution, so to speak), the story flows in an excellent and well-grounded way in spite of the continuous journeys and changes between times. Personally I came to chapter 22 thinking that it would have been a great end and very suspicious that there were still two other chapters and what I could find in them. Nothing further from my suspicions, the producers/writers gave shelter to those fears and I found the perfect brooch, which finished closing all loose ends and made round this great story that is ""Steins;Gate.""
Finally I wanted to mention the great sound section that has both the melodies inside the series in the highs and lows as one of the best opening I've ever heard. At the height of the series, it says everything about its great quality.
If you are thinking of seeing it, do not hesitate: just do it. You will be thrilled, you will be surprised, you will suffer, you will be in tension, you will laugh and above all you will enjoy each one of the chapters to the maximum.
- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)
""Steins;Gate"" es probablemente uno de los mejores anime realizados nunca. Es una historia de ciencia ficci√≥n, viajes en el tiempo y efectos mariposa. Normalmente esos ingredientes se suelen entremezclar en este tipo de producciones de forma pretenciosa y pomposa, pero aqu√≠ no, aqu√≠ todo transcurre de forma natural, sencilla, ""de andar por casa"". Y al contrario de lo que pueda parecer en un principio, eso suma en lugar de restar.
En gran parte esto es gracias a una terna de personajes genial, donde todos y cada uno de ellos est√°n perfectamente definidos y van evolucionando de forma que se empatiza y se les coge cari√±o cap√≠tulo a cap√≠tulo. A todos. Y eso no es f√°cil de conseguir.
Empezando por el protagonista, Okabe Rintar≈ç (Okarin para los amigos, Hououin Kyouma para √©l mismo), con el que hay que superar la barrera que crea al inicio debido a su histrionismo, esa risa mal√©vola, ese hablar por tel√©fono de mentira (aunque todos nos lo cre√≠mos en los primeros cinco minutos de serie, confiesa) y todas sus peculiaridades, pero luego se convierte en el protagonista perfecto de esta historia. Sin olvidar por supuesto a la adorable Mayuri, a Kurisu (-tina), que al margen de ser un personaje valiente e inteligente nos da el punto rom√°ntico de la historia e incluso a personajes algo m√°s secundarios, pero no por ello menos importantes, como Suzuha (una mina de giros de gui√≥n), Daru o el/la extra√±o/a Ruka.
Cierto es que ""Steins;Gate"" comienza de forma muy desconcertante, con una estructura retorcida ya desde el inicio que hace que los tres primeros cap√≠tulos, m√°s o menos, acaben y a√∫n no est√©s siquiera m√≠nimamente ubicado en lo que est√°n viendo tus ojos. Podr√≠an haber sido algo m√°s claros y expl√≠citos con la trama al inicio, aunque no se puede negar que es tambi√©n parte del encanto de la serie (especialmente dada su tem√°tica), esa confusi√≥n y el ir atando cabos poco a poco.
Exceptuando esto y quiz√° la divisi√≥n excesivamente marcada en dos partes (entre la introducci√≥n y la acci√≥n/soluci√≥n, por decirlo de alguna forma), la historia fluye de forma excelente y muy bien cimentada a pesar de los continuos viajes y cambios entre tiempos. Personalmente llegu√© al cap√≠tulo 22 pensando que habr√≠a sido un gran final y muy receloso de que a√∫n quedaran otros dos cap√≠tulos y lo que pod√≠a encontrarme en ellos. Nada m√°s lejos de mis sospechas, los productores/guionistas dieron carpetazo a esos miedos y me encontr√© el broche perfecto, que terminaba de cerrar todos los cabos sueltos y hac√≠a redonda esta gran historia que es ""Steins;Gate"".
Por √∫ltimo quer√≠a mencionar el gran apartado sonoro que tiene, tanto las melod√≠as dentro de la serie en las situaciones √°lgidas como uno de los mejores opening que he o√≠do nunca. A la altura de la serie, lo que dice ya todo sobre su gran calidad.
Si est√°s pensando en verla, no dudes: simplemente hazlo. Te emocionar√°s, te sorprender√°s, sufrir√°s, estar√°s en tensi√≥n, te reir√°s y sobre todo disfrutar√°s cada uno de los cap√≠tulos al m√°ximo.",10

                It has everything that i want in an anime. I can't find that fails.Well,it isnt a problem to me but it is a bit slow at the beginning but it is compulsory to understand the story and characters.
It made me cry,laugh.I was touch by its story and characters. The relationship between Okarin and Makise is f*cking amazing and it broke a lot of times my heart.
Okarin is my favourite main character.If you are starting this anime,please only wait. Christinaaaaaaaaaaaaa,Daru,Mayuri,Susuha are really good characters.
Steins;Gate have the best time-travel story ever, it is masterly crafted.
In conclusion, Steins;Gate is a masterpiece. Do you think that it is TU-TU-RU
                  time?",10
"
                Steins;Gate blew me away. I did not anticipate that such a wave of emotions could be conveyed through time travel. What is real? Are memories what determine our past? As Kurisu puts it, ""People's feelings are memories that transcend time"", combining something both heartfelt and pensive. While the plot demands your close attention at certain points, it's well worth giving it. The animation is splendid and the soundtracks aren't bad at all. While the initial episodes did cast some doubts about the brilliance of this show, filled with eccentricity for its own sake, it really lifts off after after tragedy strikes. Its tone is then
                  transformed and sustains this until every episode leaves the viewer wanting for more. While lighthearted with ""tuturu""s and immaturity, the characters explore their thoughts with a healthy dose of madness unlike any other show. It unveils the psychological impact loneliness and misery could have on a person and the need to still persevere. There is no insta love and the main romantic arc is believable and simply wonderful to watch. It possesses both spectacle and substance. It's a story that tinkers with time, flirts with love and embraces with possibilities. Definite 10/10.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is easily one of the greatest animes of all time and a personal favorite of mine. 
The character design is excellent, the soundtrack is incredible, the story is fantastic and the characters are great. The chemistry between them is fantastic. My personal favorites are Okabe Rintaro and Makise Kurisu.
Every single episode of this anime is intriguing and brilliant. It can be quite difficult to understand in the first episodes, but the more you watch the more you learn about the universe and the rules of it.
Definitely watch this series. It's one of the greatest ever made and I would recommend it to every single
                  person on Earth.",10
"
                Just watch this anime already. Stein:gate is by far have one of the best if not the best story telling ever. You can never expect what happens next, the character was unique, Okabe himself too
It original started as a visual novel game that you play, but with anime adaption, gotta say. I actually cried when I finished this anime.
The story is also unique, time-loop and romantic. There are choice that will make the MC regret for choosing. There are also choice that not the best one, but he will have to do it anyways. It force the mc into making the worst choice as possible
10/10
                  - ""a ride that you will never forget.""",10

                [ First Review in MAL ]
-storm- gives you Steins;Gate [ Review ]
Steins;Gate a Sci-fi japanese visual novel developed by 5pb and Nitroplus for the Xbox 360 in 2009 then later we get the anime release in 2011.
If your looking for an anime which has awesome Sci-fi and involves time traveling then I got a show you. And that is Steins;Gate of course.
Story:
The story revolves with our main character Okabe Rintarou or he likes to call himself HOUIN KYOUMA!! and his group of friends, as they mysteriously makes a time machine which can send text messages to the past,then getting involved in Time Travel Mayhem (which
                  is totally epic) And investigating the mysteries of the secret organization SERN.
But later Okabe realizes that messing with time will actually fuck up the space time continuum.
I find the plot really interesting,by interesting I mean amazing cause there are so many twist and turns which will keep you glued to your set. I'll give the plot a 10/10 for sure.
Art:
The Art is pretty decent and enjoyable nothing too fancy and great for a Sci-fi anime. I'll give the art a 8/10
Sound:
The OP ""Hacking to the Gate"" by Kanako Itou was great and the ED ""Toki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku"" by Yui Sakakibara was also pretty nice, which totally matched the theme of this anime. And the soundtracks also matched the theme. So I'll the sound a 8/10 as well.
Character:
The story mostly focused on Okabe our Mad Scientist and he is probably one of my favorite characters cause of his so freaking funny. Than we have Makise Kurisu who is a Red haired genius and has a little 
tsundere probs. And Daru and Mayuri who are there from the very beginning as one of Okabe's Lab Members in his Lab And lots of other characters like Suzuha a girl who works at a TV store and Moeka a girl who is addicted to her cell phone (oh fuck) and Ferris Nyan Nyan who works at a maid cafe which is May Queen Nyan Nyan Lol. Then finally Rukako, a cute girl who is actually a ......hmm your better off not knowing what she actually is. Well the characters are very funny especially Okabe so I'll give the characters a 9/10. 
Enjoyment:
Steins;Gate is seriously a enjoyable,funny,entertaining,awesome,mind blowing,must watch anime. Probably one of my favorites and totally will blow your mind in the end with the awesome twist. And so therefore I'll give 10/10 enjoyment.
Overall:
If your a Sci-fi fan or yet to be one,I seriously recommend this to you or I recommend this to anyone cause this anime is promising and you will love this for sure. 10/10 Overall :D",10
"
                STEINS;GATE IS AMAZING!!!!
I have nothing to say, this is the best anime series I have watched 10/10!
Also, I don't understand how people can find the first 8 episodes boring enough to drop it, I was hooked after the end of the first episode as I just wanted to find out what was going on and this carried on up until the end. The characters are wholesome and the anime gets deep at times...a true masterpiece.
Is Steins;Gate good? Definitely YES!!
It is a really good Sci-fi Show. It's a really good series, the first half is a bit slow but the second half is one of the
                  best experiences I've had with any anime. I highly recommend it for that alone! It has everything except magic.",10
"
                After re-watching Steins;Gate for a second time, I have to say that I'm even more impressed with it now than I ever was before.
I'm not even sure where to start. This entire show is a roller coaster of emotions. Going from a slow start, to the brink of humanity. It starts out so innocent but ends up in a bloody mess as you travel through time with the infamous Okabe, and his lab members he acquires through time, showing their stories as we try to find out why certain events arise.
Honestly I can't say I've found any faults with the art-style, it's all very seamless
                  and dripping with emotions. Everything has a purpose, and nothing is done to fall short of great. As to say the same for the sound. I watched the dub, opposed from the sub, and I must admit I loved the voice acting. In my opinion it fits the characters better, but they say whatever you're exposed to first sticks better.
But why exactly do I love this anime so damn much? It's because of Okabe. From the start he acts like a maniacal mad scientist with a touch of intellect to tone his words. But from what we encounter over time, he realizes his mistakes and corrects them, but never strays away from the ""Hououin Kyouma"" persona that he always tends to drift to. But his real struggles are the ones he starts, and finish. He accidentally built a time machine that leads him into a world of pain, and memories which he will never forget, but only he will remember. If we look at it from the rest of the lab members, Kurisu seems to be the best fit for him. She understands him the entire time and guides him without her even knowing what she's doing. The entire lab and their members have so much to atone for it's hard to express what I want to say. Just know that you're in for one hell of an emotional ride with this bunch.
Now where does this leave us. Well you have an extremely well thought out story with some very minor mishaps, that all seem to make a 360 toward the end. It's a fight that nobody has ever fought, and everyone has fought. I highly reccomend watching this anime. It's damn near perfect and definitely one of my favorite anime of all time.

                Generally really enjoyed the anime, it has some amazing vibes. The physics concepts used in the anime are really cool and can truly spark an curiosty towards seeking to understand them. I did find it pretty slow paced some parts I believe should of had happened quicker. Sometimes I felt like it was out of place. The main caracter is truly amazing and made me laugh often, really enjoyed living his journey through him. Some caracters I found less cool and could definitely have been made better, even making me cring many times. The caracter Makise could have been better. Really fell in love with
                  the show.",8
"
                Steins Gate, story about time traveller. Well after all, I like very much this series, full of emotions. But, it has some feelings just like movie disappearance of suzumiya haruhi. But it has more conflict than movie suzumiya haruhi. When you talk about time traveler, those story talk about how future will change if you change the past. Both Kyon and Okabe must endure great burden, in order to make time & friends get normal. There is other series or movie that have some story about time travel/time leap, like toki wo kakeru shoujo. I like them very much, I'm very recommended not only this
                  Steins Gate but also other movie that I mentioned before.",10
"
                Here is one opinion among many others! It is up to you to judge whether it will be worthy of your reading or not, in any case, it will be subjective.
Let's start by talking about chara design, as said above... Made by Huke !!! What ?! Huke ? You don't know who he is ? He's just the father of Black Rock Shooter. ;P
For my part, I totally adhere to this rather dark style ! The characters end up with a frightening charisma that suits their respective characters perfectly.
The music itself didn't mark me more than that. No exceptional theme.
But special mention for the OST
                  on the piano in episode 6 which is sublime!
Then, OP and ED that suit the anime very well, I think: the OP sounds right, dynamic and at the same time quite dark, and the ED offers us a beautiful melancholic song.
In short, not exceptional but honourable.
Concerning the casting of the seiyuu :
How not to pay attention to Kana Hanazawa doing Mayuri !!! [ Tuturu ! ~ ]
Okabe's seiyuu, Mamoru Miyano, is not at his first work either: Kira from Death Note, Zero from Vampire Knight, Death the Kid from Soul Eater, and more recently, Takuto from Star Driver, to name only the best known.
I also like Kurisu [ -Tina! ] Imai Isami's seiyuu, although I don't really know her. It's the same one from the game apparently.
I now come to the main point, the story.
Currently, I've seen six episodes, and frankly... I'm hanging on to death!!
However, you should not advise this series to those who are looking for a relaxing moment without headache, because in this anime ... There are some headaches !!! (in the good direction however)
Indeed, the mystery is omnipresent there, and it starts from the first episode.
All this is skillfully conducted: the veils are gradually lifted on the enigmas, during the episodes, and at the same time, new questions appear.
The main theme: time travel.
And what is interesting is that this anime is based on reality.",10
"
                ""No one knows what the future holds. That‚Äôs why its potential is infinite.""
The subject of time travel is no stranger to the world of anime, so it takes a lot of work to make a time travel story stand out. But Steins;Gate does exactly that. It‚Äôs a suspenseful ride that you will not forget any time soon after watching it. The world of Steins;Gate is so enjoyable to experience and the plot is so incredibly thrilling and engaging that you‚Äôll be on the edge of your seat for most of this 24-episode journey. This is by far the best-executed time travel story that I've ever
                  seen in my experience with anime.
Okabe Rintarou is a self-proclaimed ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù who spends his time hanging out in his laboratory with his friends Mayuri and Daru. Occasionally, they manage to invent futuristic gadgets, although these are never worth mentioning as they are almost always useless. But one day, they accidentally invent a time machine that can send text messages back in time, and thus, alter events in the past. And, obviously, by changing the past, they change the future, and must, in the end, try to fix what they‚Äôve altered.
Steins;Gate is a time travel story, but unlike most other shows, this anime doesn‚Äôt just use time travel as a plot device, but instead, time travel is the focus of the entire plot. And, in terms of time travel, Steins;Gate has no noticeable inconsistencies. It seems to obey its own rules and also explores this world of time travelling and time lines while putting in acknowledgements of real-world theories like the butterfly effect. Admittedly, the first few episodes are slow and may turn you off as, without context, they can be confusing and leave you puzzled as to why they‚Äôre included. But, if you stick with it, your patience will be paid back ten-fold, and this slow start will be justified when all is said and done. Everything changes when Okabe and his lab members invent the Phone Microwave that can send messages into the past and have a huge impact on the present.  The intrigue and mystery begins, and the pace of the series accelerates dramatically. When Okabe, in a horrifying way, finds out about an evil organization called SERN, he is forced to use this time travelling device to prevent from getting captured, and ultimately stop their plans. At this point, this amazing Sci-fi thriller kicks into high gear and puts the viewer on the edge of their seat for the rest of the series. What follows is a fascinating and complex plot that manages to blow your mind each episode, and throw in numerous surprises and sudden turns that make you keep watching episode after episode. It is executed perfectly. The show features numerous jumps in time, but still manages to keep the viewers‚Äô attention while not being too overbearing or confusing. The pacing throughout the series is also superb. Piece by piece, the mysteries of Steins;Gate are unveiled, ultimately, working towards a fantastic and satisfying ending that leaves no loose threads.
In addition to its well-written background behind the time travel concept, Steins;Gate‚Äôs seemingly clich√© story is unique and intriguing because of its great characters. The characterization throughout the series is fantastic. The characters are written in such a way that you are bound to like them. Each of them has their own likeable and recognizable traits that are important and serve their own purpose in the narrative. Kurisu is the tsundere who is the more rational counterpart to Okabe and whom Okabe confides in most. Mayuri is Okabe‚Äôs childhood friend who has been at his side for most of his life. Daru is the nerd whose perverted jokes lighten up the series so it isn‚Äôt all serious drama. Other characters, such as Suzuha, Ruka, and Moeka, are introduced as well, but they are really only used to advance the plot, as their characters are less interesting. Overall, these characters aren‚Äôt well-developed and don‚Äôt change over the course of the series, but I don‚Äôt think that really matters for this story. The main focus here is on Okabe Rinatarou and his interactions with the others throughout his journey in attempting to correct the past and subsequently the present and future. Okabe is the only one who can remember the world line before and after they have been altered. And, because of this, he is the only one who can fix the mistakes they‚Äôve made. We watch him struggle through a multitude of timelines, repeating things over and over again, until he gets them right. Okabe is one of the most intriguing and genuinely enjoyable characters I‚Äôve seen in anime. Due to these events that unfold, his character is constantly changing and this development is done exceptionally well. Throughout the story, he transitions from the typical mad scientist personality that‚Äôs somewhat cocky and acting like a know-it-all, making jokes about Dr. Pepper, to being completely broken and depressed by his repeated failures. This development has a very realistic feeling to it, which makes the story as a whole even more compelling.
The art of Steins;Gate is perhaps the field it lacks the most. It isn‚Äôt spectacular but also doesn‚Äôt look bad. The art isn‚Äôt jaw-dropping, but it does what it‚Äôs meant to do: portray the atmosphere as well as possible. The colors are darker and more neutral and the art style has a realistic feel to it. I found the visual sequence of the OP incredibly intriguing and I think it perfectly captures the tone of the show. It‚Äôs somewhat overwhelming, confusing at times, and yet, it draws you in, perplexing you and stirring up a sense of curiosity in what this world holds. Movements and other animations are fluid and seem natural. Overall, the art and animation are up to the standards of what you‚Äôd expect at this time. It matches the tone and atmosphere of the story and accurately conveys the general mood. It‚Äôs nothing outstanding, but also not detrimental. The overall sound of the show is great. The voice acting is very good all around, especially that of Okabe‚Äôs whose maniacal laugh is brilliantly done and perfectly captures the essence of the character. During much of the anime there are numerous quiet moments where rather than listening to soft music, you‚Äôre usually listening to nothing, just the voices of the characters themselves. This accentuates the importance of those scenes that do have music and also creates a nice contrast of mood between scenes. The soundtrack does a wonderful job of emphasizing the mood and atmosphere. All of the tracks perfectly fit their scenes and evoke emotions of suspense, curiosity, or sadness. Notable pieces include the OP ‚ÄúHacking to the Gate‚Äù which is fantastic, setting the mood for the show perfectly, and immediately hooking the viewer. And also, ‚ÄúGate of Steiner,‚Äù which is played numerous times throughout the anime, and is essentially the essence of the anime captured into one piece, with it evoking emotions of curiosity and confusion, while also being thrilling and upbeat.
Steins;Gate is revered as a masterpiece by most, and rightfully so. At first, it might be hard to get into, but after this slow beginning that becomes more interesting and important later on, you‚Äôll be hooked and find yourself unable to refrain from watching episode after episode, slowly crawling to the awesome ending ahead. This anime will twist your emotions in multiple ways throughout; you‚Äôll laugh maniacally and seconds later silently cry. You will become engrossed in the lovable characters, and most importantly, it will reward your thoughts with great closure and clarity, leaving you more than satisfied. Steins;Gate is an absolute must-watch, and is definitely one of THE best thrillers in the history of anime.",10
"
                As a sci-fi story lover, after watching many sci-fi anime and reading sci-fi manga, I'd say Steins;Gate is the best so far.
Story: 9
Even though time traveling is a common theme for modern anime and manga, Steins;Gate managed to deliver this theme in a whole new model. It was interesting enough with the details of World Lines, Alpha Beta World Lines and such.
At first, I was all like, ""This is going to be a VERY hard anime to understand..."" But it's not! The first few episodes are hard, I admit, but they explained everything I need explanations in later episodes. It became lighter with the explanation,
                  and I'm not bored with each episodes.
Art: 7
Let's be honest. The art is not the best. I don't really like the art, but since the story is nice, I just let it go.
Sound: 9
I didn't pay much attention to the BGM, so this review will only focus on the voice acting.
I haven't seen the dubbed version yet, but the Japanese version is really emotional and awesome. I like Mayuri's ""tutturu~"" It was so cute! And also Hououin Kyouma's maniacal laugh. I can really feel Okarin's suffering through all those time leaps through the voice acting.
Character: 9
Story is good, voice acting is good. What do you need? A good characterization!
Each character is unique by its own. Though I find them a little standard, but it is quite realistic for a science fiction theme. I like on how Okarin took a mad scientist persona with his maniacal laugh.
Enjoyment: 10
Overall: 9
I really enjoyed Steins;Gate. Who can predict that sending one email to the past can change the present so much? That's why we should never meddle with the past. I recommend this very much.
The humor makes me laugh so much, and the drama makes me cry in the corner.
How about you? Well, watch it then you'll know!",9
"
                Steins; Gate is a masterpiece and deserves all the recognition attributed to it since it is not easy to make these types of stories and with everything
I can safely say that it is the best time travel anime out there to this day, hoping someone will take that title away from it.
Steins; Gate is my favorite anime and most likely always is, but the first impression it gave me was boredom, I don't know how an anime that in its first 11 chapters didn't seem like a big deal became me
favorite anime, I had high expectations as I like all things time travel related and
                  I can say it fulfilled them and
exceeded.
SPOILERS-SPOILERS-Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0-SPOILERS-SPOILERS
The story is the strongest point of the anime since it is cooking little by little, I have seen and read that many people weigh
first chapters and it is the reason that some take for not continuing to see it (including myself), the first 11 chapters are 100% necessary since they are
the basis of what will come next.
The next 13 chapters are a roller coaster of emotions, so many problems and situations that the characters go through, I love them, some examples of
that's like when Okabe has to choose whether to save Makise or Mayuri, I like how the plot plays out to that point. When Suzuha
goes back to the future and we as viewers think everything will be fine, but we got an amazing plot twist when we found out that
suicide and that chapter I'll never forget, as well as the part where Moeka shoots Mayuri, uff men, what a good plot.
The story is very, very good, and it's very difficult to structure it that way as it touches on a lot of real life topics like wormholes,
the time traveler Jonh Titor who came from the future in search of an IBM 5100, etc.
Being a very complex story it is very very easy to ruin it since the subject of time travel has many paradoxes, the adaptation of
White Fox was great as they could have screwed everything up if they messed up some of the VN.
his chapter 23 is so good that just a little Mayuri action like NOT slapping Okabe causes the Steins: Gate 0 line to be created.
Speaking of Steins: Gate 0, I find it as good as Steins: Gate, as its plot takes place in a world where there is no Makise in human form,
the problems that Makise's pope causes to the world of the future, the way Okabe travels from that apocalyptic moment to the past to
To prevent that future looming towards them from coming, I personally missed Makise in Steins: Gate 0, but I understand that she couldn't be
there in his human form.
The end of Steins; Gate 0 turns very well as in the Steins; Gate, since at the end of Steins; Gate through the phone we see Okabe from the future of
Steins; Gate 0 telling Okabe from Steins; Gate that must save Makise, but the good thing is that that scene that intrigued some of us was able to appreciate in the last
Steins; Gate episodes 0 when Okabe records that video for the Okabe from the past to receive.
Throughout the anime you become fond of the characters, each one of them fulfills its function.
Okabe as a protagonist cannot be better, he is my favorite protagonist and always will be, both his humor and the way he suffers and
The impotence he feels is very well transmitted to the viewer.
Makise is also an excellent character, she complements Okabe very well and they are my favorite couple.
Itaru is a very good character as he fulfills his role in a good way and his version of Steins; Gate 0 makes me like the character more.
Mayuri has an evolution as a great character since it is for her that the Steins timeline is created; Gate 0, I like her version of 0 already
that it looks like the character evolves due to the situation they live
They 3 have a more significant evolution in 0 since they had to mature after Makise's death and I like that.
Moeka may be the character that in Steins; Gate I hate like you have no idea but in Steins, Gate 0 they change you to that character in a phenomenal way.
Suzuha is my third favorite character behind Okabe and Christina but I still love this character and everything that has to happen and her version
of 0 I really like it.
Rukaku shines more in 0, but in SG I like when they change his gender xd.
Rumiho would say that she is the character that I like the least of all, but that's okay.
Steins; Gate is a work that every anime fan has to see since it is one of those animes that could be considered masterpieces, you could
Recommend to anyone who likes time travel and will surely love it.",10

                I had been putting off this Anime for a long time now, and I thoroughly regret it. I've never been more moved by a Anime's likeness to make me think about it a few days after. If you haven't seen this Anime yet, drop whatever you are watching, take my advise, and just watch it.
Steins;Gate does time-travel right, and with a distinct twist to the whole genre. Despite the fact that there is not a ton of action in this Anime, the visuals are stunning, even when used during fast sequences. The music helps bind the story elements and the characters together. I felt like
                  I was on the edge of my seat the entire time I was watching. 
In order to speak about some of the other elements, I will have to discuss spoilers. If you've gotten this far, go watch the show then come back, it's know fun to have someone else discuss the plot of the story if you haven't experienced by it already right?
Some gripes I've heard about Steins;Gate is it's lack of character development. I strongly disagree with these statements, development is felt from the perspective of Okabe Rintaro. He has the Reading Steiner ability, which allows him to remember what happened in his past timelines. Through this, he can also remember all of the other characters traits and developments as the story unfolds. This is especially felt with his thoughts of Makise Kurisu, as she is essentially a prodigy of science. They both discuss effective ways of solving problems, though sometimes it takes them a while to stop frustrating each other. During this, I really liked the way they both connected. Later in the Anime, things start to go wrong as Okabe's childhood friend, Shiina Mayuri will keep getting killed regardless of the actions taken by Okabe. After his discovery, he starts to undo all of the changes he made to the timelines. Towards the end of the Anime, I hadn't realized almost until the end that Okabe had to return to a timeline where Kurisu is dead, and Mayuri is alive. Effectively he had to choose between his best friend, and the person he fell in love with through all those experiences. 
As the Anime resolved, I shed some tears, it was effective. I was seriously moved by the effects of the and stress the show possessed. I was thoroughly invested in the characters and the outcome of every decision. Rarely do I find an Anime, or really anything for that matter that can keep me pushing for every detail. It might not be an extensive Shounen, or some grand adventure, but the thoughts of a man twisted in peril, doing his best to save the friends he loved so much.
This is a Masterpiece, every minute is addicting and full of emotion. I've found myself desperately wanting more. I've already seen all of the other content, after watching Steins;Gate first of course, and I want more. The characters held everything together, the music expanded on emotion, and the visuals displayed amazing sentiment. This will be my favorite Anime, even though I've only seen it recently.",10

                This is my favorite anime. I was going to write a joke review but apparently it needs to be longer. Don't expect anything professional here. I'm just a dude watching TV in quarantine. 
I've seen a lot of people complain about the first half of the show, which I personally was fine with because a little bit of slice of life (if you can even call it that) is good. Plus it is very essential to the second half! Episode 8 is actually what hooked me because the final scene was perfectly executed and I'm also a sucker for time travel and it's consequences.
I've watched
                  this in both sub and dub. I'm glad to say that both are of solid quality. You will however miss out on Okabe's Japanese VA if you choose dub.

                It was an anime i was asked to watch quite a lot over the past few years but i kept putting it off. I decided to finally give it a go and finally, two characters who insult each othe, act like trolls but can have a laugh with each other, kind of relates to the type of friendship/relationship i like xD 
As well as the plot development with Kurisu and Okabe, i enjoyed how the story progressed from something that was full of jokes and troll's to something serious. I always felt that this would end up happening. 
There wasn't a huge amount of characters
                  which helped the anime in my opinion, all the characters seemed to have a big part to play in the show which was nice. 
I really enjoyed watching Steins gate and it's highly likely i would rewatch this very soon.",9
"
                As expected of time-traveling plots, everything in the beginning has to come back around at the end. Nothing's better than the sudden click of understanding, the ""Ohhh, so THAT'S why that happened!"" Steins;Gate does this wonderfully with its story. Although it can be slow at times, almost everything that happens is set up that way for a reason.
I had no real problems with the art, sound, or characters. None of them stood out as bad, but none of them were exactly inspiring either. Due to the structure of the story, I enjoyed some parts of the show more than others, but it was all worth
                  it in the end.
A decent anime with an amazing story, which is enough to carry it to my final score of 9.",9
"
                Let me take you through a gate, a Steins;Gate, into the world of time travelling anime. Critics such as Heihachi Mishima were evidently opposed to such a risky and often clich√© genre. However, it is my sheer opinion to say that this anime is not without flaw. At times, it felt like I was watching Mirai Nikki, with Yuno Gasai ripping the panties off of a shackled little boy that is the protagonist of this show. It is also important to note that this show was stricken with yaoi scenes that were often distasteful and excessive in nature. Yet I would be lying to say
                  that I was not only intruiged, but so aroused that I started to question my very own being. At times, I wish that I could time travel back to the time when I was confident in my identity, but that goes to show how much this show really does paint the picture of socioeconomic disparity and extrastential crisis.",9
"
                Consider: can the universe be justifiably called infinite?
Doubtful.
It may not have a discernible end, but it had a beginning.
And its component parts definitely have a limited cosmological shelf-life.
Splitting hairs or not, if history tells us anything, it's that scientists often make very poor poets.
We‚Äôre all just a ship of fools chasing phantoms, heedless of what really underwrites natural law.
So begins Steins;Gate, the show of time-travel twists and turns that took the anime community by storm back in 2011. And if that poetic science-babble (courtesy of the excellent English dub) set to a fuzzy tracking shot of telephone polls interspersed with flashes of a weary cityscape
                  didn't clue you in right away, you are in for quite the ride.
Set in Akihabara, a district in Tokyo widely regarded as the center of Japanese Otaku culture, Steins;Gate centers around the members of the Future Gadget Lab, which is actually a group of supernerd college kids who spend their time dicking around and developing bizarre, yet useful, gadgets. Chief among them is Okabe Rintaro, A.K.A. the ham to end all hams. A self-styled mad scientist who speaks in Shakespearian rambling and demands to be addressed as Hououin Kyouma, he is an absolute delight to behold, a more gleefully ludicrous successor to the likes of Kamina and Light Yagami. The show could be nothing but him bounding his insanity off of his fellow lab-members and I would be perfectly satisfied.
But there is indeed a plot, and quite a gripping one at that. Everything changes one fateful day as Okabe attends a seemingly innocuous lecture at the radio building. There are strange occurrences. Someone ends up dead. Then a text is sent, and the world... changes. Things are slightly out of place. Somehow, the text was sent back through time. And Makise Kurisu, the brilliant young scientist who's lifeless body was just bleeding out in a storage closet, is alive. Somehow, the Future Gadget lab has stumbled across the path to making a time machine.
From there on, it's off to the races to build a functioning time machine as Okabe and company bounce off each other, acquire new lab members, and become embroiled in a sinister conspiracy that lurks in the shadows, just waiting for the perfect moment to explode into the light. This show juggles a metric buttload of plot, and to its credit, it handles it exceedingly well. Everything feels tight and well planned, with little excess flab or wasted time. The incredibly fun interactions between the characters form the story's backbone, and they're constantly riveting. From the deadpan Lothario wannabe Hashida ""Daru"" Itaru to the laid-back badass Suzuha Amane to the delightfully sweet Shiina Mayuri (who grounds the clueless airhead archetype in a refreshing degree of sincerity and pathos), the ensemble cast of Steins;Gate is easily its biggest strength, carrying the plot forward with self-assured confidence and grit. Once things get truly serious later on, and these characters we've come to know and love find themselves facing some truly horrifying Catch-22s, it's genuinely powerful stuff.
That said, I have two issues with Steins;Gate that keep me from prostrating myself before it like everyone else. Firstly, there are a few moments where, in attempting to be dark and serious, the series crosses the line into unintentional camp. Don't get me wrong, the philosophical implications of time travel and the effect that exploring it has on our characters- you know, the important stuff like themes and symbolism and such- all stands strong on its own. But some of the plot machinations later on feel like they were cribbed from a Saturday morning cartoon and poorly re-fitted to try and match the show's off-kilter, highly stylized tone and mood. Not too many, but enough to be distracting.
Second, I find that the one weak link in the ensemble cast is, unfortunately, a pretty major one: Makise Kurisu, the woman who cheated death. She's far from awful, and I have a lot of respect for her quick thinking and intense inner drive. But she never really manages to transcend her archetype (in this case, the tsundere) the way the rest of the cast does. I mean, when we're nearing the toughest decision that our characters will ever have to make and  the show still makes time for ""hurr durr her shirt got wet so now Okabe can see her bra and she's all flustered"" and other such sophomoric ""gags"", it feels like an opportunity was missed somewhere. Which sucks, because for reasons too spoilery to talk about here, Makise is quite possibly the second most important character in the show behind Okabe, so the fact that she just isn't quite up to snuff with everyone else ends up keeping the intensely emotional climax from landing as hard as it wants to.
Issues and all, though, Steins;Gate is a one-of-a-kind experience. There's so much more I could praise in this review, from the stylish not-quite-greyscale color palette to the haunting sound design and music to the impeccable direction, but for the sake of not overstaying my welcome, I'll leave it there. What you choose to do with this information is up to you.
Best of luck. El Psy Congroo.",7

                Anime (manga) is based on events that actually happened.
In addition, a lot of scientific knowledge has been introduced into history.
Different part of the story and various images taken from actual information have been introduced and arranged throughout the anime.
On the other hand, almost all the characters were invented.
The only character who has not been invented, and who really existed is John Titor.
When the construction of the anime, in terms of the story, the drawings made, the Japanese dubbing of the characters, the music, as well as the animation, we can say that it is of a real pearl.

                Pretty fantastic anime. As a Berserker, Akira, TriGun, & Naruto fan I thought an anime like this would wind up being pretty boring. It's actually not, it captivated me like Death Note in ways. The story is pretty good, the time travel concept is well thought out and not confusing. The characters are pretty funny. There is a lot of clever monologue, if your a Quentin Tarantino fan then you might enjoy this. It can be touching at times, a bit neurotic, and absolutely hilarious. 
""Tall as a willow, slender as a reed, a dude"" - This scene just cracked me up.

                well there are many masterpieces but Steins Gate is the one which actually does deserve a 10 rating without any hesitation...this is the first anime which i saw without any break both Steins gate,and Steins Gate 0
'It is those who possess wisdom who are the greatest fools. History has shown us this. You could say that this is the final warning from God to those who resist.‚Äù - Okabe Rintaro
well the quote of Okabe was just to show how great he is as the main character in the series.....to be honest,he is one of the best tragedy characters i have seen comparing to other animes....he
                  faced a lot of tragedy related to the time machine his group created and also his beloved ones like Makise Kurisu or Shiina Mayuri...sometimes he broke and gave up but his spirit is admirable....the tragedy he faced,a normal human would give up on his will to live but still,he did not give up and said that he would move forward...no matter what he faces,he will overcome them and as the episodes go forward,the thrill just increases.....the ones who did not see it,i will highly recommend this one....mostly there are animes where we get bored at 6-7 episodes at a stretch but this anime has high potential...why,you say?First of all,the animation...well its just too perfect to praise in words.Second,the story plot...the plot is just way amazing....i felt too tragic watching Okabe falling into despair but still holding the stick just to save his world.actually i was crying sometimes even after I finished the anime.the anime is kinda too much of a masterpiece that i cant even describe in words.if someone watches it,i shall guarantee that they will give it a 10 rating without any hesitation.the opening song and the ending song,the animation,the story plot are all single masterpieces.i shall thank White Fox to present us with this great anime.",10

                A self-defined mad scientist who is nothing but a wannabe and conspiracy theorist gets a group of people from, presumably, a LAN party and invents a time traveling microwave that is destined to destroy the world.
f*cking watch it. 
Unfortunatly, i can't just leave it at that so i guess i will pander a bit more.
The story is top notch, if not a little bit complicated, it has its healthy doses of humor along with tragedy, conspiracies and good ol' madness.
Sound and Art is on par with what you would expect. Nothing that is going to stick with me but it does its job very well
                  and to a very good quality so i'm not gonna deduct points off of my overall score because of it.
The characters are god like. You will have a special place in your mind for them because they are all so fitting yet relatable.... in a quirky kinda way.
As for enjoyment, look back to the first paragraph... yeah.
Oh and the intro is really catchy, it doesn't really effect my score but its one of the things i look forward to when starting a new show, its like the cover of a book and this book has a very sciencey cover.",10

                   Hiya, I decided to write an anime review for the first time so I decided to go with Stein's Gate.
   The first half of the series has a light atmosphere, and is much more comical than the serious and dark tone set in the second half. We are introduced to Rintarou Okabe, self-proclaimed mad scientist. At first, Okabe is just a bottle of crazy sauce to us, talking to himself over the phone on many occasions. As self-proclaimed mad scientist, he thinks highly of himself and sports overconfidence - until he meets Makise Kurisu. The two often compete with each
                  other on the topic of time travel, and end up becoming rivals as well as friends. 
   Eventually, something terrible occurs in Okabe's life as he gets further into studying time travel, and decides to go on a journey to set things right. As this event unfolds, he switches gears from his usual, comical self to a more serious individual. In my opinion, Okabe's character development is one of the best, if not the best that I've seen thus far in anime. It makes us think to ourselves how one event can change a person so drastically.
   Overall, I give this anime a 9 out of 10. Some parts of the story were unclear at times, but the lack of clarity is made up for via character development. I highly recommend this anime to anyone looking into the sci-fi genre, or just looking for a great anime to watch. I hope that you found this review to be helpful, and with that I bid you adieu!",9
"
                This is my first review so let me know how i did and whatnot. note that i know noting about sound and art so i won't weigh in on those
Steins;gate really surprised me as a whole. It has a slow start which is what almost made me think it would be a disappointment, but then things suddenly started to pick up and from there it was epic the whole way through
Story 9/10
Like i said above, it starts of kind of slow, which is good for character development, but even during the slow start the show intrigued me. There was just something that what was happening
                  which i found interesting. But things eventually pick up and after that the show is amazing. even when it slows down again for a small bit it's still great. My only issue, is that even though the ending was great, it just seemed too picture perfect after all of the stuff that had happened in the anime.
Characters 10/10
The characters are something that make the show. There's enough character development where it gets you immersed into the characters, but not so much where it hurts the story. With starting off With character development off the bat it honestly made me enjoy the story more since i could feel for the characters and had a extreme liking to them. I won't sit here and say i like every character in the show, but the way they all developed is something i'm really impressed with since it doesn't happen often. 
Enjoyment 9/10
I loved it, main reason it went down is mainly for the slow start, while it helped everything as a whole, it brought my enjoyment of the beginning down just a tad since there were times i did find it boring. besides that i enjoyed it all. There were characters i didn't like but that happens in every anime so it never effects my enjoyment
Steins;gate was a amazing show and i would reccomened to anyone that's into the genre and even more.",9
"
                What can I say about this masterpiece that people haven't already said? 
After finally watching this, I can see why people say it's one of the greatest anime of all time. The voice cast is incredible, the art is great, the music is amazing, and the story is among the best I've seen in any anime. 
It wrapped up a little quickly for my tastes considering how brilliant the pacing is in the first 20 or so episodes, but I realise that's the consequence of adapting multiple endings of a visual novel. 
Finally, Mamoru Miyano is a god at voice acting, and Okabe is one
                  of the best-acted and best-written characters I've ever seen in any anime.",10
"
                This beautifully complex anime, might just come off as too overwhelming for some in the beginning, since Time Travel slaps our faces from the get-go not to mention the notable difficulty in keeping up with the main character's professionalist ego, yet it ultimately settles on cementing a relationship of love so beautiful, and with such perfect and made-for-each-other individuals ,that it seems to transcend time as well as our expectations, and steals away the whole show and our hearts ,forming a bond with these two that just leaves us wanting to see more.
A beautiful tale of finding love across time.
Trust me. You will love Makise

                Tu Tu Ru!
Welcome to Steins;Gate, a normal anime with normal people. Oh, and you can send emails to the past to change things you don't like. But otherwise, it's totally normal.
Steins;Gate is 24 episodes long (with one special episode and a movie to boot). For the first half the the series, the main cast of characters are introduced, but they don't get the crux of their development until the second half, when the series really hits it's stride. In fact, the first episode in particular will likely leave you confused. And by the time the last episode finishes you may well consider it to be
                  one of the all-time greats, like this humble viewer.
Let us the start with the characters and the story. Each character is a carefully crafted individual. More importantly, they feel like real people while also being unique and interesting. Okabe is the primary protagonist. A self-proclaimed ""Mad Scientist,"" the guy is borderline insane. He talks to himself constantly in front of others, using made up phrases like ""the Organization"" and ""El Psy Congroo."" Yet the man also has a naturally good heart. His closest and longest friend, Mayuri, plays the little-sister role and becomes very important midway through the series.
Then there's Itaru ""Daru,"" a beefy, perverted friend of Okabe's who works alongside the mad scientist as the hacker. Suzuha, the part-time, mysterious girl working for the landlord of Okabe's flat; Ruuka, a boy who works at the shrine yet looks strikingly like a girl; Faris, a waitress and owner of a cafe whom enjoys playing along to Okabe's delusions; Moeka, a tall girl with a severe social disorder; and of course, Kurisu, the red-headed genius girl whom plays a vital part throughout the series as Okabe's ""assistant.""
In a nutshell, those are the important characters without spoiling anything. The cast of characters is small, thankfully, so as not to overindulge(more on that later). The cast itself is brilliant in their normality. They each have their own quirks. Comedy is used here and there and helps them feel real, but it rarely feels forced. You'll feel the same emotions they do when they love, hate, and grieve. Thankfully there is little nonsense to be found alongside it. No 15 minute flashbacks or excessive monologuing. No exaggerating or flamboyant poses. No transformations or antagonists who stand there and watch while the protagonist has a 10 minute conversation with their cohorts. When someone dies here, it's usually sudden, with no last exchanges. On the rare occasion that there is, it's brief, held only to one or two sentences. This is how death should be written. Any other situation is usually eye-roll inducing.
This brings me to the main story of Steins;Gate. Essentially, Okabe and Itaru ""accidentally"" create a time machine in their Future Gadget Laboratory, but it's limited- they can only send short text message (or emails, if you prefer) to the past. Eventually Okabe's friends hear about this and want to use the machine themselves. Okabe, being the good friend that he is, allows them to. And with each change that each friend makes, the world around him changes more and more. Incidentally, when there is a change in the timeline, in reality the world line simply shifts to a new world to reflect the new reality made by the text message (think multiverse theory). No one retains their memory from the previous world line, as the new world line is reflecting the new ""reality,"" affecting memories. The exception is Okabe, whom has an ability called ""reading Steiner."" It allows him to retain his memories from the previous world line. With each new message sent, the world shifts further and further away from the original world that Okabe knew. 
This is where Steins;Gate initially gave me pause. They create a time machine out of a microwave, by accident no less. Time travel is such a complicated subject that it doesn't seem at all plausible. Upon further consideration, perhaps creating it by accident isn't so unbelievable itself, since the world has seen many inventions which were, in reality, accidents. Then there's Okabe's reading Steiner ability, which has no real explanation other than ""I must have got it when I was very ill that time."" These are minor qualms, however, as if everyone, including Okabe, forgot about the previous world line there wouldn't be much of a plot to speak of. In the end this was a minor thing to accept, but it still bears mentioning. 
Even so, considering the story features time-travel, a touchy subject that is already full of holes, it is surprisingly well crafted. The story uses real theories, specifically the most popular ones, and even utilizes real life aspects that were a topic at one point, such as John Titor and the IBN 5100. The ending will spark it's own discussion among fans. For some, they may complain that the ending is too ""happy"" given the context of the series, but I disagree. With an infinite number of world lines, the vast majority of them, as you'll soon see, are downright depressing in how they end, and there's nothing wrong with that fact. With each one having it's own unique ending, I don't see anything wrong with having a ""true"" ending, where all the lose ends are tied up and everything is figured out by our beloved Mad Scientist. Remember that technically, those world lines still exist, even if Okabe's memories are being transferred from one line to the next.
The art and sound are performed fantastic as well, for it's time. As aforementioned already, this isn't an anime with super transformations or giddy outfits. This is a normal town with normal people, so they don't have to design anything fantastical like with many anime, but what they do design is done the way it should be. Scenes that should be shaded are, emotions that need to be shown are. It goes back to the normality of it all, and that applies to the music and sound as well. There isn't music or pop-rock jamming going on in the background the vast majority of time; just characters talking, interacting, and the scene playing out. But when the music does play, it hits home hard. Multiple scenes were executed perfectly with the addition of the well-timed music. The English dub too, is fantastic. This coming from someone who watches most of his anime in subtitles.
As a final mention, I'm really thankful the series is only 24 episodes long with one awesome special to go with it. It's short enough so it doesn't overstay it's welcome, yet long enough that the story moves fluidly and as natural as possible, with ample enough development for all the characters, without overindulging. 
Steins;Gate is quite frankly, one of the most brilliant anime to have ever been released. It is just so refreshingly normal in how it weaves it's story, despite being a tale featuring time-travel. The characters feel so human that you must have a heart of stone to not have them tug at your heartstrings several times throughout the narrative. This incredible journey, despite minor hiccups, will be forever remembered as an all-time classic by this viewer.

                A true masterpiece. I have watched over 500 anime I would say in only the past year as I was immediately obsessed. I recently discovered MyAnimeList pretty late but noticed this anime was the second rating (at the time) I decided to watch it and the progression was slow but enough to keep me on my toes and entertained.  The slow progression allows for great character development and a roller coaster of emotions and suspense. Some people think (personal experience) that the progression is slow and boring but if you take the time to understand the plot (the plot is kind of confusing) and
                  pay attention you will be jaw dropped at the end. It is so well made and is one of few animes to leave me completetly blank and depressed at the end. There luckily is a continued version (Steins gate: 0) that focuses on a different ending. The music is also good and it fully deserved the rating it has.",10
"
                This anime is definitely one of the best science-fiction & drama combined anime. Of course, this may be considered a very subjective way of criticizing. But I am not a professional critic, nor an animator. So it is inevitable for me to be affected by all the emotions and memories of when I watched the anime. That's why I don't recommend you to read this review as an objective one.
The story begins with a very confusing tune. It is normal to be confused as the anime focuses on one the most confusing themes, time traveling. But it opens up to newer levels of quality and
                  excitement with each episode. So if you like science-fiction related productions, I don't recommend you to give half way up because you think it is boring. Believe me, it will get better. Way, way better. Still, I wouldn't dare to say that everything is perfect. Even I, ridden with all kinds of emotions, have noticed several plot holes and mistakes. But this has never ruined my enjoyment of the medium. The satisfaction and abyss I felt after completing the anime made it frighteningly easy for me to ignore all the mistakes. 
While the art fits quite nicely to the mood of the anime, I would say that it could be way, way better. The details of the reactions of the characters were conveyed much better in the visual novel. So I expected a quality matching that of its as well. Still the animation is very smooth and makes one to connect with the characters. 
The OST is definitely one of the best. I wouldn't even argue for this. Give the OST a try before you watch the anime. I am sure you will fall in love with it. I have never met anyone who hasn't. Takeshi Abo and Jun Murakami have done an excellent job. Even after all the years since I have watched the anime (it has been more than 6 years) I still listen to the OST very often.
Characters are what makes this anime so special. Especially the protagonist, Okabe is one of my favorite characters ever. All of the characters are just so relatable. There is much more to say about the characters in this anime, but since I can't give any spoilers I simply want to say that the drama in this anime is so strong that it makes one dumbfounded. It was something that I have never expected, that made this anime even more fascinating for me.
I have cried, I have laughed, I have been on the edge because of excitement, I have felt dissappointment and happiness. This anime made me feel so many things that it is impossible to express them in words. This anime is the one you are looking for if you want drama and feelings, all wrapped up in a brilliant science-fiction story.",10

Steins; Gate is a perfect example of a well rounded anime with dynamic characters and great plot progression. Each episode leaves you on your seat wondering what happens next. The characters in this anime are very human-like, which I find uncommon in most anime. When I say human-like, I mean that it is easy to relate to the characters and, although being an anime about time travel, their lives seemed very realistic. This anime would definitely be worth watching and will make you think twice about changing
                  the past!",8
"
                If you're looking for something very, very interesting, this is just for you.
This has, in my opinion, zero fantasy. One hundred percent science, but rather fictional. I myself am not very old, and that's why I like this anime very much. (i am not sure if I'm spoiling here...) Throughout the anime it teaches you many life lessons, although you might just not realize it. Well, for a rather science-ish anime the first few episodes are rather difficult to understand because of the wide variety of {quantum} terms mentioned.
Characters are rather interesting, tough, and it could almost be considered as a comedy. 
Brace yourselves! PREPARE
                  YOUR SOUL WHILE WATCHING THIS ANIME. 
One of the best ones I've ever seen! GO FOR IT, DON'T EVEN HESITATE TO START THIS!",9

                Steins;Gate is a show is about Okabe Rintarou, a crazy, delusional scientist from Akihabara who happens to have a strong obsession with time travel. One day, a bizarre sequence of events takes place, where Okabe experiences that the flow of time has been altered.
Together with his assembled team of lab members (which mostly just consists of his friends, really) he decides to investigate further, along with his lab members who are forced along this crazy ride.
 The team initially consists of Itaru, the lazy friend but skilled hacker, the lovely and cute mascot Mayuri, and the super intelligent, but always suspicious of our mad scientist,
                  Kurisu Makise. They accidently develop a way to send messages through time using a microwave. As you can imagine, this of course leads to a lot of crazy things happening. 
With the paranoid and self proclaimed mad scientist who refers to himself as ""Houin Kyouma"", Okabe Rintarou (Okarin for short) must not only find a way to further evolve the recent discovery, but must also evade the international scientific organization known as SERN, who he belives conspire against him and his team because of their groundbreaking discovery.
It's been a while since I've had so much fun watching an anime as Steins;Gate. The humor is top notch in this show. With Okarin being the lunatic that he is, with his witty comments and deranged world view, it adds such a fun and exciting atmosphere to the show which makes it such a fun watch.
The voice acting is really good. Mamoru Miyano plays Okitabe Rintarou with such fluidity and skill that is rare to achieve. Kana Hanazawa performance as Mayuri is none other than breath taking, playing the innocent and pure part with such ease.
Asami Imai stars as Kurisu Makise, and we have the veteran Tomokazu Seki playing as Itaru, both of whom playing their parts exceptionally well. The delivery and the chemistry between the actors makes the charcters feel alive, and they've certainly succeeded in capturing that magic that gives the characters and the show such a depth. The screenplay and the direction is excellent as well. The creative direction and the performance together really feels like a fresh breeze in the warmest of summers.
Along with Okarin, the supporting cast are in general all different from each other and have their own unique personality and sets of reasons for being dragged along with Okarin to a dangerous, but equally exciting journey through space and time against a super agency. As the story progresses, great becomes good, good becomes bad, and bad becomes worse for our characters, and we're catapulted into a disarray of uncertainty that leaves us craving for more.
Steins;Gate is a show for anyone who wants to have a good time, and who is looking for that special something that is just vastly different from many of the shows we're accustomed to. It's rare to have a show as unique and engaging at the same time, and it will most definitely leave a smile on your face when you watch it. It's no wonder why it's considered the best show of 2011, and one of the best shows to ever be animated.

                This show is one of the greatest series I've ever seen. Such a fascinating and engaging approach to the concept of time travel, fully humanized by the characters and plot to pull me in and take my breath away as it progresses. 
All of the characters have their own special quirks that left me caring for each, particularly the main friend group headed by Okabe Rintarou, the self-proclaimed mad scientist. I found myself quickly becoming entertained with these characters, feeling everything from happiness to depressive devastation as the story went along. 
The story began in a way that for many would be somewhat confusing and
                  perhaps even hard to get into, but as it goes along and explains itself more you get the ropes of what's going on and become more immersed in the world. Unexpected turns occur throughout always leaving you wondering what will happen next, and often leave you with a strong emotional response. The captivating blend of sci-fi thriller with the dark and thoughtful undertones put this series on another level. 
A truly delightful experience in every sense. The characters and story alone make it well-worth the ride. But the implications it leaves for the concept of time travel add another layer of thought-provoking ideals to grapple with. Which makes it even more worth the experience in my opinion. All in all, one of my favorites without a doubt and a show I fell in love with very early on.",10
"
                This is my personal favorite, although it is not perfect, we humans love things regardless of their imperfections and even learn to love those imperfections. Stein's gate is that one thing for me. 
The story follows a batty and delusional main character through his journey of love, friendship, struggle, and of course; time. 
The story was outstanding, it is creative, heartbreaking, heartwarming, and downright entertaining. Most of the characters are well established; you form a strong connection with them, you feel their pain, their joy, all of it. 
Although the pacing can be difficult to get used to for some, it is well worth it,",10

                Tutturu!~ Time travelling? Not a new topic in anime, but this one does it perfectly! Steins;Gate is probably the best anime I've seen about this topic. Also, now it's my favourite anime of all time. I just wish it was longer *sigh*.
Story: 9/10
For the few first episodes the plot is a bit boring in my opinion, but after that it really takes off! The story is very well done, and I can't even expect things that will happen to actually happen! The anime exploited my weak spot, which is relationships, very well. The use of English at times was hilarious as well!
Sound: 10/10
Steins;Gate has the
                  best voice acting I've ever heard in anime. It's really brilliant! A lot of ambient noises are used, which gives a great overall feeling. You can even hear emotions in the characters' voices, which is great! When the phone rang, I sometimes thought my real phone was ringing!
Characters: 9/10
Characters are what makes Steins;Gate what it is. Each character seems to be fitting the story (almost) perfectly. I literally had to sit in front of my PC and watch the anime completely from the start to the ending, because the characters were so interesting! Especially Okabe and Kurisu. The only character I found a bit annoying was Faris Nyannyan, but only at times.
Art: 10/10
The studio did a very good job with this one, the animations are fluid and very well made, I didn't experience a quality loss at any part. It was a pleasure to watch.
Overall: 9/10
Apart from the first few episodes, this is definitely my favourite anime to date.",10

                Steins Gate is an Anime I had planned to watch for a very long time before I got the chance. I was interested why it had such a good MAL score and was not often talked about in Anime groups I was part of. When I finally started to watch it I was first confused, then slowly hyped, as I started to figure out what was happening and the devastated when the theme shifted around Episode 12. Steins Gate did a great job in introducing a small cast of characters with all very different personalities that are much deeper than one would imagine after the
                  first few episodes. It intrigues with an interesting plot and a rather scientific way to talk about time travel. I loved the fact, how everything was thought through, the characters and their behaviour, the plot and all comes together in the end. The ending truly did justice in my opinion, as it all came together, so all clues from episode 1 did in the end prepared the ending from the very beginning. That was masterfully done, and did in no way seemed forced. The Characters were well written, and especially Okabe in the second part of the story showed a great deal of dephts, not often seen in Anime. 
Steins;Gate did a interesting way to tackle to famous time travel genre and in a way ruined it for me. I can`t watch any time travel stories anymore, as I would always compare them to Steins;Gate, which is for me at least, the absolute number one in that genre.",10
"
                Have you ever thought about time-lines? A parallel worlds that exist between this world and the next? Well here it is, this anime features a man who could time-travel and remember what he sees on that world he once saw. From there we could foresaw what will hapen next.... Wait, not so fast. What made me said this anime had a 10/10 rating for Story is not a fraud. There's an interesting character development and discovery that leads to change the world lines. With an art comparable to the visual novel (it's source), interesting character, and superb sound that will make your hearts melt. Wait,
                  did i say this anime will be one of those tear-jerking anime? Oh yes it is. A few tissues will be required near the end of the series. Well, overall it's an almost masterpiece anime that you should be watching. The only thing that i don't like about this anime is just.... It's just... OMG, i almost spout out a spoiler :3",9

                "" Life isn't about doing things over. "" - Hououin Kyouma ( A Mad Scientist )
Time travel premises never gets old, from the blockbuster classic Back to The Future to anime masterpiece Kimi No Na Wa, despite many different models of time travel has been introduced, they all revolve around the same concept - when there's an action in any timeline, there will be consequences. This phenomenon is knowns as the "" Butterfly Effect "" and it's the surface core that drives Stein Gate in its way to being a masterpiece.
The apparent concept of time travel is simple but as the story progresses, deeper and
                  deeper layer of time travelling is unveiled, along with the repercussions that comes with it. For the nerdy part, it's a charm to be introduced to the interesting concepts such as the fiction of transmitting memories from never impulses to bytes form that just shows how interesting the concept this premised is based on and the infinite possibilities that converge from one single action that you have taken presently, past or in the future. It's not something to just brush off because it was introduced in a science fiction anime but a concept to deeply think about and appreciate how amazing this moment is, that takes you here.
Nerdy stuff aside, Steins Gate succeeded not only because of the time travel concept but the fact that emotions are added into play. The male protagonist, Okarin is initially portrayed as a highly delusional mad scientist with a tie to the ' Organization ' but soon he met more lab members and learn more about them and to concede to his feelings that he was never able to. The story will give you insight of the emotional burden that he faced, being the only one that knows everything, and yet unable to voice them out. The painful moments that he wishes to cherish from. 
The merit point that keeps it from being dull is how well the story is constructed, triggered by one event that lead to all the chaos that comes after and how they diverge like the little strings in the thread that seemingly has no connection or ending. Adding a little coloring of suspense, romance and mystery to the thread and you have the beautiful yet complicated form of story.
They say birds of a feather flock together, in this case, weirdos stick to a lab together. The cast is ensembled with a fat otaku super hacker, a red-haired genius 'tsundere' girl to a gentle and sweet friend of his and more. Each with their own story, each with their own feelings that circles around Okarin and his delusions. They all play their role perfectly, that adds more value to the story so that you will either be shocked as the suspense comes or laughing for the silliness.
Overall, Steins Gate is not something you should only entertain yourself with but to realise that life goes on, and no matter how delightful or unappealing the past might be, we could never time travel back. After all, life isn't about doing things over.",9

                I think my attitude towards Japanese animation has changed forever after watching Steins;Gate. I have little experience in watching truly great anime, and this is the first work that caused me such admiration. This is my first review, so please don't judge strictly. 
This story tells us about a carefree (at first glance) guy named Okabe Rintaro. In his laboratory, he and his two friends develop interesting gadgets, which he himself calls ""Gadgets of the Future."" But one day, randomly, he sends an SMS message to the past, after which the future also changes. This is the starting point of the Steins;Gate. Any violation of
                  the events of time makes itself felt and we all know perfectly well what this leads to. SPOILER: it doesn't lead to anything good. But our heroes do not understand this yet. There is a lot of drama in this anime and it really touches to the depths of the soul. As the story progresses, new members join the three friends in the lab. Kurisu Makise stands out well among all. This is the person who will help and support Okabe throughout the story. I know that nothing is perfect, which I can also say about the Steins;Gate. There are disadvantages everywhere, but there are more of them somewhere. somewhere less. But against the background of the pros of the plot, the cons just nothing.  I'm finishing up with the specific details here, now let's talk about the series as a whole.
Let's start with the characters. The characters in this anime are thought out superbly. And I'm talking not only about the main characters, but also about the secondary ones. Everyone has their own story, which is shown to us throughout the series. I won't say much about Okabe and Kurisu, I'll just say that Okabe in the first and last series are two different people. He turns from a carefree boy into a responsible man who is ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of his friends. Lovers of romance and love relationships are also waiting for a pleasant surprise.
Now let's talk about the sound and visual component. The opening of Steins;Gate is a cult opening that many people listen to and watch to this day. OST ""Believe"", which we can hear during the drama of Suzuha and her father, touches to goosebumps. It is still my favorite soundtrack. The visual part of the anime is made in cool tones, the eyes do not get tired while watching. The art is great,  I think many people will like it. But also, I can't say that the art in this anime is the best I've ever seen.
Now let's summarize the entire review. I was pleasantly surprised and I will never forget Steins;Gate , it is by far my favorite anime of all. I have never experienced such a number of emotions while watching anime. I strongly recommend everyone to get acquainted with this masterpiece.

                I love this series!  I came into it expecting to enjoy it but was not expecting it to such a degree, I'm genuinely flabbergasted.  There are bits and pieces I could pick at but I just can't seem to allow myself to lower this from a 10 because of how much I actually enjoyed it.  There is a bit of a slow start but when it kicks in... it REALLY kicks in.
The art style was solid, done well enough to make any of the characters immediately recognisable and memorable, as well as a lot of the locations, but other than that -
                  nothing to shout at really.  It did very well in conveying emotion through both the characters on-screen and the audience.
The opening and ending themes were very well made but I feel like they should have swapped to a new set at around the 12 episode mark - it started to feel a little bit repetitive.  The overall sound effects were good but weren't amazing.
Rintaro Okabe (Hououin Kyouma) (Okarin) - The self-proclaimed mad scientist and our protagonist throughout the show. 
Kurisu Makise (Assistant, Christina, The Zombie, Experiment-Loving Girl, Perverted Genius Girl, Celeb Seventeen, American Virgin, @Channeler Chris) - A genius girl who is a fresh university graduate and the assistant in the lab. 
Mayuri Shina (Mayushii) - Okabe's childhood friend, a cosplayer at May Queen Nyan-Nyan and a fellow lab member.
Itaru Hashida (Barrel Titor) (Daru DaSH) - A hacker and a massive otaku. He is a member of the lab and a very close friend of Okabe.",10

                I expected really much from this anime series, and start watching it with caution. Well, it is on the top of both score and popularity rankings. And it is my favorite genre - Sci-Fi. So I could be so bad if my expectation did not come true. BUT they come true, and hell-yeah I love this series, and all my friends already know this, just because I talk about it really often. 
(I didn`t play the original visual novel if somebody will ask)
So Steins;Gate...
==Story==
Firstly - it is Sci-Fi and in a good old sense, no some pseudo-scientific trash or mecha, but well known and nice
                  time travel. And despite I like time travel, it also was one of the few problems of this series, it was not original. Well, Okarin and others are original, but all of the problems and paradoxes already are well known, right from the times of Wells. So if you, as I am, had watch/read much sci-fi, you will probably notice some similarities. 
But I mast admit that story is solid here, not without flaws, but still, it is the good one. What we had: time machine (so badly build), cool scientists (but some sort of degree had only one) and the evil organization who want a time machine for them. Adventures of ours heroes are interesting, sometimes fun, sometimes sad, and I will not say more. Main questions as always are questions about choice, fate and what really matters in life. 
==Characters==
Ten out of ten. Probably even better. It is them who define this anime as epic. They are really good, not many fiction works had so interesting and realistic (with one remark) characters. 
Main character: nice guy, a good friend, and creative person - Okabe Rintarou, but you probably will remember him as slightly perverted, MAD SCIENTISTO Hououin Kyouma! But everybody calls him Okarin. He is not the just regular mad scientist, because he is not scientist and he is not mad, but he act like this, and it is fun to follow him. And he is so real for me, some of his distinctive features can be found in me too. You can go in some technical faculty of the university and you will find someone as Okarin, they running around, speaks some nonsense and trying to create time machine out of microwave and Geiger counter. And these people can do the greatest discoveries, so do Okarin. 
All others characters are good too, Kurisu Makise - the best time travel hot science girl, and well she had a good personality, despite being tsundere sometimes. Daru (Super Hakar) - some fat perverted genius-hacker, who add some awkwardness to anime, but not many. His pervert phrases are inserted just in right moments to create fun situations, and they do not spoil anything. Mayushi - main moe power of this anime. She is fun, nice and cute, be seriously prepared, not many can deal with so much kawaii. Tut-TuDu!
And there are more of cool characters. And they all changes with the flow of events, it easily to believe in their relations and motivation. You will love them all and probably will feel all their feelings. I definitively will remember them.
Well and there goes the problem of all anime - They all are so young. Like Okarin - 18 years, and he created a Time Machine, Kurisu - 18, and she is one of the best scientists in the world. Why not give them some more time. But not.
==Music and Art==
It's all good, nice ED and OP, but nothing special. And nice art.
==Enjoyment==
This series had right proportions between fun and serious staff and unexpected turns of the storyline, what you possibly need more?
If you fan of sci-fi - it is for you. If you are a fan of drama  - it is for you... Well, it hard to even find someone who will dislike this series. Even if you dislike anime - you still can watch this and have a good time. It is mast-watch for everybody.",10
"
                While time travel is often used as a lazy plot device, there are some shows that are about time travel and are able to add something new to the topic that even the first human person thought about after regretting the decision to cuddle the saber-toothed tiger.
Steins;Gate is a story about time travel and its problems. Sure, it might be nice to simply revert time and try again, but can we change fate? How many times will we fail before giving up?
The story follows the protagonist Okabe, an useless member of society and his friends, the ""super-hacker"" Daru and Okabe¬¥s childish childhood friend Mayuri. The
                  group spends most of its time sitting around in their ""Future Gadget Laboratory"" and occasionally inventing a new, useless ""Future Gadget"" with random version numbers. At a congress about time travel, Okabe finds the female scientist Makise Kurisu stabbed, he runs away and gets a text message which triggers a hallucination. After coming back to his senses, he learns that Kurisu is alive, but a big metal thing crashed into the congress building. Kurisu visits the group at the Future Gadget Laboratory and they learn that one of the Future Gadgets is able to send text messages into the past. They spend the first half of the series fucking around with time and helping out their friends, until shit hits the fan and Okabe has to save the world.
While many people say that the first half of the show was boring, it does a good job in setting the rules for the world the story takes place in and introducing us to the amazing written characters. The fact that we know most things about time travel by the time time travel is actually used in a serious way is an important factor that makes this show so good. Many shows have the problem of using time travel as the deus ex machina and making the rules up on the way, Steins;Gate tells us what is possible and what is not. You can¬¥t send messages to the future and the person receiving the message has to actually do the thing to have an effect on the world. The introduction that takes half of the runtime is mostly necessary to make the characters grow on the audience.
The characters, spoken by amazing voice actors, are the biggest source of enjoyment in Steins;Gate, they have understandable motives and are realistic. Okabe is introduced as a sophomoric young man who has nothing but his self-esteem, Daru is a fat pervert who sits on his computer the whole day and Mayuri is a child in the body of a young woman, sweet but annoying. This main cast and the other, not less strange side characters, support each other in their daily life, and this is what makes us love every single one of them. In the second half of the series, we meet every character again, we learn about their past and feelings. Okabe as the protagonist stands out, he has quite a bit of character development in the second half, he is someone who really cares about his friends and wants to help them, but has to recognize that he has to decide whose wishes are more important.
Steins;Gate is a great show, it manages to use time travel to tell its story rather than using it to set up the story or save the protagonist if the writers have written themselves in a corner. If I had to name a thing that I disliked about the show, it would be the supporting characters that appear two or three time throughout the story. While I still liked them and they managed to give a new perspective to some cliches in anime, they still felt one-dimensional in comparison to our amazing written main cast.
Steins;Gate is an anime that nearly everyone in the community watched and liked, it deserves the attention it gets. While some have to sit through the story of the first half, the second half is an example for well structured and written story with characters that have a great dynamic in their group.",9
"
                I consider myself someone who cries easily when given half a reason--I'm sensitive to emotions, especially those (in narratives) that drive fears and loves and sacrifices--but even so, I don't expect any story to cause me to cry regularly during the last 12 episodes the way I did here.
But the entire reason I got to the point of crying at the drop of the hat is the groundwork laid by those crucial first twelve episodes. These characters are truly endearing. Some of it is the way they're written as individuals, some of it is the way they interact with each other (nearly every conversation feels
                  good), and--oddly, since I've never noticed this as a huge perk with any series aside from Fullmetal Alchemist--this is one of the best voice-acted series I've ever watched (w/original Japanese track). Seriously, these voice actors go a long, long way in making these characters come alive. They manage to take individual character traits that should be annoying (Okarin's boisterous laugh or Mayuri's regular ""too too roo!"" greeting) and make them a crucial part of their personality such that they're some of the series' highlights.
It's a really well written show. It's a time travel show, so there's a couple of logic leaps if you want to nit-pick, but there's no such thing as a time travel narrative without some logic that shouldn't be examined too closely. But that's not even the impressive part--no, the impressive stuff's in the details. They don't make the mistake of explaining things like ""gel-nanas""--they just use them, let them exist. The restraint to avoid overexplaining minor details is often overlooked, but separates a good show from a great show. 
There's doubtlessly a lot that has been said about Steins;Gate better than I could say it, so I won't bore you with further rambling. Suffice to say, I'm really glad Steins;Gate become a part of my world.",10
"
                Steins gate
I don't even want to think about how many years it took me to finally start this anime and how many excuses I had as to why I should wait. To be honest, better late than never?
Steins Gate is the obvious representation of the ""time travel"" theme in the anime scene. And not only that but a really successful one, thanks to the implementation.
You know it, surely everyone has already seen/played these typically paradoxical time travel films or games and I would like to destroy hope before one goes into the illusion that it would be different here.
No, even at Steins Gate, various topics
                  and explanations are quickly and professionally skipped, swept under the table, or bridged by certain technology so that you don't have too many questions. Despite everything, Stein's Gate is not flawless, but this does not apply to any anime/manga without exception. Even the very best titleholders have flaws and flaws, and that's the way it is here too.
Various scenes about jumps in time, justifications for certain actions, are never really explained. However, I respect the variation in how these things are covered without it being too obvious to the viewer.
What catches the eye again and again later, however, is the plot armor and the inability of the opponents. Instead of presenting an actual ""danger"" for the protagonist, they manage to let him escape on banal variations over and over again. Whoever finances this troop should better think about it. In the scenes that were shown to the audience alone, the protagonist managed to escape 3 times, despite the overwhelming number of enemies. However, this is the only real negative aspect of the anime. This is massively overshadowed by the implementation of the anime adaptation. This includes the structure of the scenes, the arc of tension, the capture of the atmosphere of the scenes, the musical background, and the creativity that primarily detaches these events.
It didn't bother me, but the questionable use of fan service on really unnecessary scenes shouldn't have been. The anime really didn't need that.
The actual plot of Steins Gate is impressively staged and already has a structure in episode 1 that only comes into play in episodes 23-24. The actual topic of the D-Mails, the time travel telephone microwave, and the use of the ""butterfly effect"" were realistically interesting. In one way you could say, yes, the plot was practically created by the idiocy of the protagonists in the first place. Without their actions, this would never have happened. But then again, who can blame a scientist for trying to take new steps? This is impossible, it is a part of humanity, you will always go into the unknown because you are blindly looking for the truth, you strive for development no matter how much you want to reject it. And so it was wonderfully presented what these consequences could actually be and what they cost you.
What surprised me the most and most positively about the plot was of course the implementation and how the episodes were structured. Not to mention the cliffhangers in the episodes, which were introduced with the perfectly fitting ending song to bring the tension to the ceiling. I lean far enough out of the window to say that this anime has been my favorite ""time travel"" theme so far. Movies and games included.
The characters, God, how much I've longed for something like this. Are all character's stories relevant? No. Are some of them almost all fillers and exist for humor? Yes. However, this is inevitable. The story is just about 4 + 1 characters that got caught up in this whole story.
What impressed me about the characters even more than their likable personalities are their amusing and clever conversations. At least mostly until they start provoking themselves with perverted sayings about which of them is the greatest pervert. Most of the characters' backgrounds are very interesting and their D-mails have a big impact on the series too. Especially the events with the time machine from episodes 15-16 and the ""letter"" from Suzuha which by far initiated one of the best scenes I've ever seen in an anime. By which one saw again how serious such consequences and transparent such events are.
Again, the characters were mostly pretty personable. The kind and caring Mayuri, the active Suzuha, the Tsun ~ dere ChristinA. And of course the man of all hearts, Hououin Kyoma. Not only blessed with divine intellect and charm but a chuuni like no other.
But some supporting characters had a certain charm, but mostly seemed irrelevant because they had nothing to do with the topic.
and only lived their lives.
Steins Gate had probably the best intro I have ever heard and seen. Not in the field of music, it took until the intro caught me and I got a catchy tune. But how well it worked, that both the visual representation and the music matched the anime so much. I could hardly imagine it with any other intro.
But the intro is irrelevant because the anime adaptation had what I miss in many works. The correct use of cliff hangers and musical support. A good example is the ""Promised Day - Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood"" when the sun rose and the music suddenly started playing in the background, this gives the scenes the perfect charm. And it was the same here. As soon as a cliffhanger came, the ending music was pushed forward to mix this with the situation and to give the audience an even more sense of tension.
In terms of animation, the anime is fluctuating. In general, you almost only see the laboratory and the characters have an average representation. Most of the cars and people are CGI. However, there were several moments in which the budget was turned up to give scenes more comedy charm or to push dynamism.
Conclusion
Steins Gate is definitely my number 1 in this genre, until one day a title appears that surpasses it in quality and character. I can also recommend this work to everyone else who is interested in this topic. Both in terms of plot and characters, everything remained practically unprecedented. If the series had dealt with some negative aspects differently, I would have even been able to rate this title as 10 *, unfortunately, I cannot risk this according to my point system. However, in my heart, this anime is a bright light.

                This is my very first review on MyAnimeList and the reason why I decided to write one about Steins Gate is my fascination about this Anime.
I never heard much of this anime, even if I did watch a lot of Anime and were something people would call an Otaku. Still, nobody of my friends or I watched this anime until a few days ago. I was looking for a new series and so I took a look on the top list of all Anime, on the 4th place I found Steins Gate and thought: ""Wait, Steins Gate is number 4? How can it be I
                  never heard much of this? Is it really this great?""
And after finishing the series all I can say is: ""Yes! It is that great!.""
Steins Gate captivated me after the first episode. Finally, an Anime which hits my sense of humor. The stereotypical characters like the Tsundere Kuris or the hacker Itaru made me just laugh so many times. I loved the discussions between Okarin and Kuris. 
Nevertheless, the Series didn't become boring, quite the opposite: after around 10 episodes it became very deep and dark and hit me deep. I felt so bad for Okarin to see one of his childhood friends dying so manytimes, this reminded me of Seven Deadly sins. However, there was Kuris, she was the character next to Mayuri which put light into all the darkness in Okarins heart. I was so pleasured to finally see a good romance Anime with a beautiful ending. The love between Okarin and Kuris which is connected and exists in every world line is just great and that's how you write a romance Anime well. Furthermore, the concept of the memorie-strings in the dreams of the other characters made this series better for me.
Everything in Steins Gate made me happy and I have nearly nothing to criticise. The plot, the art, the opening, the synchro, the character development, especially Kuris and Okarin, the subjects like time traveling, general relativity. All of this fascinated me and this were the reasons for me why this Anime is definitely a master peace!
Hope you liked my review, bye bye :)",10

                Ah, Steins;Gate. My favourite anime of all time, even though my pfp may mislead into believing it's Baccano!.
Let's just start.
Story: 10/10
This anime uses the concept of time travel, and it uses it RIGHT. It shows us the consequences of using it and how exactly our characters use it. The story also seems pretty simple, a common slice-of-life anime with some time travel sprinkled in. But watch Ep. 12, and hoo boy. What a mood whiplash. Don't want to get into spoiler territory but let's just say I cried like a baby. And then kept on watching. 
Art 8/10: 
I'll admit something. The art is for
                  me the weakest thing in this anime. And IT'S NOT BAD, it's actually QUITE GOOD. It's just that, compared to the original VN, this art feels a bit... lackluster in detail. I LOVE the VN's design. 
Still, the opening's art is really good.
Sound: 10/10
I don't pay much attention to anime OSTs, but this one, man this one. Just listen to Gate of Steiner.  
The songs fit their respective moments very well, and they're very good.
The opening is also a fucking bop. HACKING TO THE GATE indeed.
Character: 10/10
Easily the best part of S;G for me. Good characters in an anime are what hook me into them. I could've just stopped watching this anime or Baccano! if the characters were bland. No! They're not bland! That's what hooked me. 
They are all very distinct. Okabe is a chunnibyo filled person, Makise is a tsundere done right, Mayushii is Mayushii, Daru is your typical fat otaku and eroge game lover (can't relate), Suzuha is the eccentric part-timer... I could describe the characters more and more. 
Let's just say that Okabe is one of the best anime protags ever.
Enjoyment: 10/10
I stayed up to fucking 6 a.m to finish this anime. I enjoyed it a bloody lot. It's great, it's fun, funny, relatable, sad, wholesome, depressive. I enjoyed this rollercoaster.
Overall: 10/10
Watch this masterpiece. Just do it. It's a certain must-watch for any otaku or anime watcher. A great mixture of fantastic story, sound and characters with a bit of good music sprinkled in, it's like the PERFECT SOUP OF ANIME.",10
"
                The greatest Dr.Pepper commercial of all time.
In all seriousness though, Steins;Gate is one of my favorite anime. Stories involving time travel can be iffy and introduce big plot-holes, but Steins;Gate sets up everything quite nicely and that wasn't a problem for me, In fact I actually can't think of any plot-holes. The art and character expressions fit the mood, and I also enjoyed the music. Following Okabe through his journey across time and seeing how he and the other characters grow and develop really lets you feel for them. They managed to fit so much into 24 episodes and after watching the whole thing, I
                  found that everything had a purpose.
It took me a few episodes to get into and enjoy the series, but I ended up falling in love with the characters and I'm so glad I kept watching. Please don't be turned off by Okabe's many cringe-worthy moments, and join him on his journey to the Steins Gate. 
TLDR; Come for the Sci-Fi and suspense, get hit by the feels free of charge.",10
"
                This anime will always hold a special place in my heart as it was my first and one of the few that broke me and i like to re watch.
If i was ever asked to recommend an anime to someone starting out this would be one of them, it has a very unique way of Time Travel and we get to see it's long term affects of using it for personal gain.
Each character had their moments to make you feel something for them but Okabe takes the cake thanks to his voice actor performance as his character has to go through several difficult discussions later
                  on in the story. 
Though this series is mainly a character driven drama, it still manages to have quite a couple of comedic moments that stop it from being a black and white drama like most, that being said the drama is great and i actual feel for most of these characters and what they have to give up later on in the series
the only thing negative i have to say about Steins;Gate is that it has quite a slow start though i think this is just to get you used to the characters and set you up for the drop into the heavy parts of the series",10
"
                First, the story is practically perfect. Not only is it very complex and rich in detail, but it is incredibly well put together, to the point that the first scenes contain key moments of the ending that only make sense once you get to it. Watching it again is a completely worthwhile experience, since it not only enriches your vision of the series, but also allows you to better understand all the effort put into the construction of the plot line and the flow that it carries.
The artistic section may not be the best I've seen, but it fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the
                  series and with the aesthetics of the events and tone of the work. The gray and dull, almost faded tone that the series has fits perfectly with the tragic and almost mechanical tone of the work, always giving a dull sensation, but fitting in with the science fiction style. The character designs are all very original and distinctive, but also fitting into the modern world of Steins;Gate.
For its part, the soundtrack and voice acting seem crazy to me. The opening ""Hacking to the Gate"" is a true banger and the soundtrack fits perfectly on almost all occasions. Okabe's voice acting in particular is magnificent and always manages to give me goosebumps at the most dramatic moments of the series.
The cast of characters also deserve my sincere congratulations, as they maintain a fairly high quality even in the secondary characters, giving everyone their moment to shine and show their deepest and most vulnerable points. Okabe of course stands out among all, having one of the best character developments I have seen in an animanga, this being a round cycle, since at the end of the series he returns to a similar state to the beginning, but now carrying all the events that occurred during the series. Kurisu is also not far behind of course, being one of the best female characters I have ever seen and having some of the best scenes in the series.
In conclusion, Steins;Gate seems to me to be one of the best existing works and the one that I enjoy the most without a doubt. It is true that there are people to whom the beginning may seem a bit slow, but it is totally worth holding on until the middle, where the entire build-up of the work explodes in an impressive way, leaving us with one of the most impressive scenes from the story of the animanga.",10
"
                I've been meaning to watch Steins;Gate for ages now. After hearing so much about it from both the VN community and other anime fans, I decided it was finally time to bite the bullet and dive in.
Story: 9
After a pretty hefty buildup in the beginning, the story grew to be a very well written piece of art. The first few episodes left me with more questions than answers, but was done in such a way that compelled me to keep watching.
Art: 7
There isn't anything striking about the artstyle in Steins;Gate. That said, it's not bad by any means. Well defined characters and all around good
                  design all the way through. The OP is very well done and has a unique style.
Sound: 7
The sounds effects in some places can be identified as regular stock effects, but they're used well throughout the show. The OP song is very nice, and one of the better ones I've heard.
Character: 9
As expected with anime with time nonsense, the character developement is done pretty damn well. I found myself loving each and every character for one reason or another, and the show exploits this in a very good way. You'll be on the edge of your seat later on in the series worrying what will come next for your favorite characters.
Enjoyment: 9
As stated above, the thrill of this series is well done, and with constant curve balls and the occasional plot twist, you'll find yourself immersed in no time.
Overall: 9
It was an enjoyable experience all around. The first few episodes are confusing, but it's meant to be that way. Very well thought through and no corners cut. I heavily recommend this one to anybody who likes Sci-Fi or Thriller anime series.",9

                Favorite Quote: ""No one knows what the future holds.  That's why its potential is infinite."" -Okabe Rintarou
Back in high school during my junior year I had a friend recommend me this anime.  As someone who watched only Naruto, I was very hesitant on trying out new anime genres.  This also meant new anime series as well.  Steins;Gate was my first anime that I have tried that wasn't Naruto related.  Well anyways I had to go back and review this anime without any spoilers. 
Story: Initially, this anime felt very confusing and slow when I first watched.  As I progressed
                  I realized the pacing of this anime was spot on. Steins;Gate,  has one of the best pacing for an anime.  The pacing allowed the story to be very engaging and interesting.  More importantly however, the idea of time traveling to the past is something that alot of shows and movies struggle with.  In short, most shows and movies involving time travel lose their overall plot.  For example, Back to the Future became somewhat predictable at time making the plot rather dull and unoriginal.  However, Steins;gate does not lose its plot. In fact, the time traveling done by the main character doesn't ruin the overall plot of the story.  So now you might ask what makes the story unique, less cheesy, and interesting than other time traveling shows and movies?  I would answer this by saying the excellent pacing combined with excellent story telling  made it an edge of the seat adventure.  I found myself wanting to find out what happens next as I progressed in the series.  The story also involves alot of interesting theories about time travel such as the butterfly effect.
10/10
Art: In general I didn't think there was anything wrong with the artwork in this anime.  Nothing felt overdone and not to mention the artwork was spot on.  The character designs done in this anime fit with their overall personalities. 
10/10
Sound: I absolutely loved the opening and the ending songs for this anime.  The soundtrack for this anime also added to the general feeling of the anime.  At times, it supplemented the anime by making more suspenseful and comical at times during character interactions.
10/10
Characters: The best thing about this anime would be the characters.  Every character in this series is complex,  interesting, and funny.  My favorite character would be Kurisu by far, but I'm not going exclude the other characters as they were all great too.  To start of, all of the characters contributed to the plot.  Each had their own personal desires and the anime does a good job of fulfilling it.  It was also surprising to see the character develop over time as the series progressed.  For the two essential characters in the series, their initial attitudes and feelings for one another can be described as water and oil.  They could never seem to agree with one  on their theories and are always bickering at each other.  Over time, their relationship begins to soften up and they began to develop genuine feelings for one another.  I also love how the characters talk about the theories of time travel throughout the course of the anime.
10/10
My Opinion: To sum it up, I was glad I did not skip this anime.  Not alot of animes can hook me in like this one did.  This anime had me intrigued and curious all the way up until the very end.  The storyline and the characters were very memorable as well.  After the series ended I found myself wanting to know more about the characters and the plot.  I am aware that this anime may not be for everyone because of the pacing could be interpreted as being very slow, but I held on and continued.  This anime definitely holds up to its name and hype as a masterpiece.  It is a fantastic that shouldn't be overlooked as being overrated or simply to slow paced.  If somebody were to ask if I had a favorite anime of all time I could gladly and confidently say that Steins;Gate is my favorite anime of all time.
Final Score: 10/10 a masterpiece
Thank you for taking your time to read my first review.  I appreciate it very much!",10
"
                Time is but an infinite paradox with a countless number of possibilities and paths that separate into others every second. This is all but fiction, where the concept can easily be tampered or altered to fit a part of any anime main plot line. But the anime that digs the concept from its roots to put it to shine is none other than Steins gate;
Story: 10/10
The story follows your friendly neighborhood slightly delusional ""scientist"" Okabe Rintarou as he brings you on a journey to bring about a revolution to humanity, one useless invention at a time. This is the point where Okabe has constructed his
                  best gadget yet- the ""Phone microwave"". Its discovered function is to reattach bananas to its former position whilst creating an unknown green goop in the process. That is when he realized that the phone microwave had another hidden ability to send e-mails to the past. This is where the real story of steins gate begins.
Time travel, the concept which the anime explains itself is simple: 
each aspect of your life that you change can alter the so-called ""pathway"" that you take down to the last bit of detail. It can cause the timeline to fluctuate but all in all you would end up with one definite point that all timelines join up to, where this might be a small fraction of the bigger picture. In order to avoid the impending obstacle bound to happen, the main scenario that triggered the cause of events leading up to that must be prevented.
In layman terms, that is the theory that the anime wanted its audience to keep in mind throughout.
The plot outline in all addresses the simple concept of time-travel as its main structure. But that was the idea that the anime wanted you to picture when jumping fresh into the anime's first few episodes. It was but a clever transition to a deeper understanding of the theory of time travel as a whole, but this wouldn't be clear until you re-watch it at least once.
Art: 9/10:
I'd admit for a science heavy anime such as steins gate, simplicity is the way to go in terms of art direction. However, the lack of detail to the surroundings is something I believe they can improve on. This is my own opinion, but however I cannot dedicate the final point.
Sound: 10/10:
As for sound, there is a fair balance of the number of sounds that can be played through 24 episodes. Though the same sound cue might be agonizing to sit through, simplicity of it is what makes it shine.
Character: 9/10:
I did not expect much from the design of the characters but on the contrary I feel that each character has to be special, regardless of their own idiosyncrasies or individual character design. For this matter, the design of each character lacked their own individuality, it feels like each person had no design that makes themselves stand out more. Contradicting the common theme of ""simplicity"" throughout the review, in this field they still have some room to improve.
Enjoyment 10/10:
Though my interest is of the mystery/thriller genre(s), I'd admit that watching this anime had been my guilty pleasure. Enthralling as it had aspired to be, it has captivated me during the process, until the point that I'd nearly subconsciously done something I never do: binge watch. 
Overall: 10/10:
Hands down, one of the many revolutionary anime's that contributed to what anime has become today. Though I'd like to set this as my favorite, there are other anime that are of the same caliber, so it'd be unfair to place it as the best.
This anime is a must watch, even to those uninterested in the genre.",10
"
                There aren't enough words to talk about Steins;Gate. It is, by very far, one of the most complete and complexes stories about time travel, which is, bi itself, one of the most interestings themes that some production can talk about.
Steins;Gate do it with a apparently calm, creating a slow story that conduces us step by step into a void of feelings and a lot of discoveries along their 24 episodes, developing the characters in a way that, without seeing, we feel attached to everyone of them.
It's hard to say too much about the anime without delivering some spoiler, so all that can say is: Steins;Gate
                  is envolving, intelligent and creative in so many ways that there is no other work to compare it with. The reaction of the espectator itself will say by itself how a masterpiece should be. And that is what it is.",10
"
                It's a show full of weirdos, hentais and whatever other weirdness/crazy that Japan is known for, and the first few episodes were just a huge turn off for me. I wasn't immediately impressed by the animation, the slow plot, and the strange characters but I trusted the high ratings to keep going. I'm glad that I finished it because halfway in, the storyline began to pick up and the episodes got more and more intense. I couldn't stop watching.
I'm not going to go into detail because I think the worst thing I can do to someone is to give any kind of spoilers in a
                  show as genius as this. You'll love the mystery, the sweet relationships between the characters (however unorthodox), and certainly by the end you'll become a new fan of the series just like me.",9
"
                Steins;Gate‚Ä¶ (Takes breath) WOW just finished the series, where to start. I‚Äôll begin with a summary and description then convey my thoughts on the series. The story starts off with Rintaro Okabe a self-praised and self-proclaimed ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù who is infatuated with time travel and paranoid about a secret organisation he believes are after him. Unfortunate events unfold and Okabe and his friends from the future gadget laboratory discover they have created a time machine. Okabe‚Äôs delusion of this secret organization (SERN) tailing him becomes a reality and the story unfolds. White Fox has done a great job with the art and animation for this
                  series and it the best art I have seen in 2012. I watched this series dubbed which was ideal because I didn‚Äôt miss anything the characters said, sucks that I had to wait till the end of 2012 to get the second part of the series though but in the end it was worth it. So if you‚Äôre reading this and plan on watching the series please I strongly urge you to watch the dub. Overall I enjoyed the entire series from the characters comments between each other especially Okabe and Kurisu, the mystery of SERN and its secrets finally the story plot. I will now go on to watch Robotic;Notes and look forward to the movie coming out this year!
Arigato for reading,",10
"
                Tuturu!
I have finished this anime...only this month...a few days ago in 2021??? This anime seems to be around since 2011 and that triggers me a little. I wish I saw it sooner. I saw a clip of it, but out of context it doesn't seem like much. But I finally watched it. It's 24-25 episodes so why not right?
It's about the young scientist Okabe Rintarou. I think he's 18 in the anime. He works on his own time machine together with two friends and asks the help of a gifted girl who he ran into at school to help him with the project.
It starts off
                  pretty laid back and silly, like Okabe and his friends are working on this project but they joke and are playful around eachother, like friends do! The scene is all fun and chill vibes.
They're so excited about the time machine that when they discuss it, they get overheard by other people, for example acquaintances. And what does silly Okabe do? He recruits them. They know about the secret, so he recruits them to help him with the project as Lab Members. I found it foolish, but then again he's 18, super excited about this time machine thing, so I can forgive it.
Together they get it to work and want to try it out of course. Whenever the time machine activates and something in the past is altered...It's Okabe alone who's conscious of this change, while the others are just 'reset in the some point in the past'  When he lets them know that the machine worked though things change...the friends start asking Okabe to use it to change their past and Okabe helps them by changing a little thing for a different outcome in those friends their favor.
It starts off good, but the changes in the world are becoming more and more impactful on the world, to the point that Okabe loses control of what's happening, for every action has consequences. And in that second half he will be struggling but fighting hard to fix the damage he has caused.
One quote in there...""The present is fine as it is. There should be no redos."" Along those lines, I liked that :)
So half of it is like just relaxing and progressing towards the creation of the Time Machine, and the other half of the anime will be rather dark and sad because of all the chaos that they created with the time machine.
I really liked the characters, Okabe has one unique and catchy laugh that I never heard in another anime. Also this anime has one of the best Tsunderes in my opinion. Usually they annoy me, this one didn't :)
This anime also left me satisfied but sad because I finished it, which is a good thing!",9
"
                Summary: To me, this was the closest an anime will likely ever get to being perfect. If you are new to anime or, for some reason, haven't watched this yet: DO IT. ASAP.
Story: 10/10
The premise is not quite like anything else I've ever seen. The story follows Okabe Rintaro, an eccentric college student who, along with his partner-in-crime Daru, accidentally discovers the key to manipulating time. I won't go deep into detail for the sake of spoiling anything, but this was easily the most addictive, fascinating, and engaging story I've seen in anime. Moreover, the themes (free will, perseverance, many more) are timeless and can
                  resonate with anyone, because the story leaves the viewer in charge of interpretation of them. Pacing is very organic (that is, it feels very natural), thanks in part to the 24-episode count allowing for plot points to be explored sufficiently.
Art: 8/10
Although the character designs may take some getting used to at first, I find the designs to be incredibly unique, and it contributes to the personality/Identity of the show. They stay faithful to the original Visual Novel, but are changed enough to feel new and different. In addition, backgrounds always look great, and the psychedelic imagery used during the time travel scenes is very memorable, in the best way possible. This all being said, there are some very noticeable dips in animation quality at times, which seldom broke my immersion.
Sound: 10/10
The voice acting is absolutely superb, especially from our two main protagonists, Okarin and Kurisu. The comedy is among the funniest I've seen in any medium (we all have our personal tastes, of course), and the dramatic scenes were profoundly resonant. From the numerous Kyouma laughs, to the random ""phone calls,"" to his banter with Kurisu (""hentai shoujo"" in particular, is one of my favorite lines), Mamoru Miyano shines as Okabe Rintaro, even more so than in the visual novel. With a voice that can be both relaxing and vexing, coupled with excellent line delivery, Asami Imai brings Makise Kurisu to life beautifully. Line delivery matches the tone of the scenes magnificently, imbuing each scene with its own personality. Lastly, Steins;Gate music is among my favorite out of ANY music I've ever listened to. Hacking to the Gate (the opening) is, easily, one of the most recognizable anime songs in recent memory.
Character: 10/10
Somehow, a sci-fi anime (which could very well have used the plot as its only strength) has some of the best characterization in anime, in my opinion. Despite the wild premise, and some of the rather *ahem* ""outrageous""quirks to the characters, I had to remind myself often that the characters were fictional, and that I shouldn't count on meeting one at an anime convention. For me, they were that likable, and that resonant. Steins;Gate not only has a truly and profoundly memorable cast, but it finds ways to integrate each member into the narrative very naturally.
Enjoyment: 10/10
There wasn't a bit of this show I didn't LOVE. Even the slower, more dialogue-heavy first half of the show, I couldn't get enough of. As stated before, the comedy is great, chemistry between the characters is extremely entertaining, and the plot/sci-fi element was done well to top it all off. I could probably write dozens of pages talking about the things I enjoyed about Steins;Gate, but allow me to summarize: when you place fantastic characters in a well-developed plot, and support them with brilliant voice actors and music, you get a bona fide masterpiece.
Overall: 10/10
Not everyone will agree with me about my opinions about this show, and that's okay. I'm pretty easy to entertain, as long as some degree of effort and care is put into something. This being said, Steins;Gate is a massively enjoyable experience, one that every fan should experience at some point. It's high #3 on MAL for a reason (though, if I could choose, I'd put it higher.)",10
"
                Steins;Gate is something everyone needs to see. No exception made.
The only bone I have to pick with this particular anime is that they've done with it what so many others have done, with equally good stories: they basically ruined it with love.
Love saves the day constantly; whether is a sibling type love or romantic, you can be sure that those emotions will be the reason things go well in the end. Though... arguably, one could say that those feelings are the reason sh*t hit the fan in the first place.
Admittedly, Steins;Gate is an anime that makes it hard to get past the first episode. It
                  took me three or four tries to get past it and onto the second episode, but once I started, I couldn't stop. The plot itself is amazing. It involves a lot of time travel and uses the alternative theory to what people call the ""Grandfather"" theory. 
The Grandfather Theory proposes that if, say, you went back in time to kill your grandfather to avoid your ever being born, you will not cease to exist. Because you need to exist, in order to go back in time to kill your grandfather. This follows the school of thought that time is self-consistent: whatever you go back in time to do will be necessary to your existence anyways.
Steins;Gate opts for another theory: every action you change in the past will simply cause the universe to slightly shift into a parallel version of itself, otherwise called a World Line.
It goes far more in depth and there's so much more to it than just that, but that's the basics of it. It also obeys a funny Doctor Who law about Fixed Points in Time, at some point.
In any case, the music and sound effects are amazing and draw you in even more than you already would have been normally, and the characterizations are beautiful. You think you have certain characters figured out but they always find a way to vary slightly from what you thought they were.
The art is also fantastic; awkward, at times, and a little more than I would sometimes like, but it's amazing nonetheless.
Overall, it's definitely a must-see, just like Cowboy Bebop and Evangelion. It is very high up there with the rest, and I hope it'll stay there.",10

                Time travel is a subject that's been covered by many movies and animes. But this story focuses on various features of time travel such as the grandfather paradox, the butterfly effect, parallel worlds, being stuck in time loops, ... Of course it's not a scientific discourse, but enjoyable entertainment. What's more, it also includes a great deal of character development. It's an anime that definitely deserves a top spot!
Story (9/10):
The first 4 episodes seem a bit out of tune. You would think it's a run of the mill comedy with a bit of time travelling in it. This is because the main protagonist, Okabe Rintarou,
                  seems a bit goofy. His ""sidekick"" Daru is a sex-obsessed otaku who has only experienced virtual relationships or ""2D girls"" as he likes to call them.
Gradually the story develops as we learn more of the main characters. Eventually things get very emotional and while you would expect a lot of repetition from the time loops, it's every time something different. It doesn't bore a bit.
Art (8/10):
Most of the action takes place in Tokyo so don't expect any fancyful displays. But the characters are nicely drawn and they are up to today's standards. CGI is not overused but to describe the more abstract concepts this was really nicely done. Overall the art was realistic and supported the story very well.
Sound (9/10):
The sound and music moved me emotionally. It's rare that I get involved in an anime, but the music really tipped me over in that direction. The OP ""Hacking to the Gate"" sounds very cool while it also delivers some tidbits on time travel. The song ""Gate of Steiner"" is mostly used to signal emotional distress between the characters or some bad omen. It's very fitting. Another favorite of mine is ""Skyclad Observer"". Usually I only remember the OP, but this anime has a few gems and deserves kudos for it!
The voice acting deserves a mention on its own. Houhouin Kyouma sounds really like a mad scientist, Mayushii is the perfect innocent girl (""Tuturu!"") and Daru sounds like the geek you'd expect.
Character (10/10):
There are only 9 main characters involved in the series, with minimal use of additional ones, so there's enough time to give every one of them some development. I was a bit surprised about Mayuri's background as she's not ""doing"" a lot but her character is really likeable and she serves well as Okabe's ""mirror"". I guess Daru's the less fleshed out, he's mostly funny and functions as the ""hacker"".
Overall (9/10):
Steins;Gate is solid entertainment. If you like time travel coupled with character development you won't be disappointed. You'll definitely follow right until the end to get to know each character and experience their joy and sorrows. It's one of the animes that gets you sucked in. Don't let the first few episodes discourage you, the rest of the series definitely makes up for it!",9

                ""You must not change the past once it's been established."" -Rintaro, Okabe
Inside the realm of anime and science fiction, Steins;Gate is a must watch series. It is by far the best sci-fi anime series I have watched and sits firmly on my top ten list. It is one hell of a mind-bending journey into time travel and the dangers of it. Much about time travel in the entertainment industry is cause to a lot of speculation from viewers as well as authors because since we don't truly know how time travel works (if it works) it leaves authors to use their own imagination to create
                  and advance on existing theories or maybe create their own. This is a show that consistently pushes the term sci-fi to its limits.
Story: 37%/40%
The story follows a self-described mad scientist by the name of Hououin Kyouma. That is Okabe Rintaro's pseudoname as he tries to make a name for himself in the science world using his obviously faulty ""Future Gadgets""
The earlier episodes could come to discourage the average viewer with it setting the whole show up. It could feel dull at times but absolutely massive foreshadowing hints are worth watching the full 20 minutes. i feel one cannot appreciate this anime by a few episodes but by watching the whole series are reflect on it.
Besides the unpredictable directions it takes with time travel, is its endearingly eclectic cast. Each of the characters is a misfit or outcast in their own way, making it easy for viewers to become attached to them throughout the show. Steins;Gates is a must-watch series like I've mentioned before. A viewer will watch how it consistently pushes boundaries in the genre of science fiction. Reaching beyond the genre of anime, it is one of the most believable and intelligent time-travel sagas of the last decade.
I sincerely recommend anyone who loves sci-fi or gets easily attached to characters to watch this anime as it will probably change your perception on what anime can actually achieve with their story. Aside from this I also strongly encourage people to check out Steins;Gate 0 which is somehow disliked by the community, but I believe it adds in so much depth to the original series.
Characters: 30% / 30%
Okabe Rintaro
Okabe Rintaro, also called Okarin by his two friends Itaru and Mayuri, is the main protagonist of the story. Self-proclaimed mad scientist under the name of Hououin Kyouma, he often appears paranoid and delusional, acting or believing he is watched by a secret organization by talking about it to himself on his mobile phone. He also shows lots of arrogance, but behind all of those traits Okabe cares a lot about his friends and would do anything to protect them. Okabe is in depth a noble person who would sacrifice even his own sanity for the sake of others. Three thousand time leaps later any other person would've easily lost their minds. Mental fortitude at its peak.
Hashida Itaru
Known as Daru by almost everybody in the anime, he is friends with Okabe since High School. He appears as a stereotype otaku, overweight, spending all his time in front of the computer playing games in their lab and loving all kinds of 2D or 3D girls. He often asks Mayuri or Kurisu to act like maids because he's a huge fan of Faris, the most popular waitress at the Mayqueen Nyannyan maid caf√©. Besides this, he has excellent computer skills with both recent and old machines, and shows great hacking abilities. However, there is a deeper theme to him that most could be led to believe. I think this character shows believable thoughts that most viewers could relate to. He is gullible but extremely intelligent. He is probably the second smartest character in the series right after Kurisu.
Shiina Mayuri
Mayuri is the optimist of the group, most of the time happy, smiling and talking in a singing way. Like when she announces her arrival with a ‚Äútutturu‚Äù sound. She is Okabe‚Äôs childhood friend and the one always taking care of the others. Even though she doesn‚Äôt really understand complicated theories, as she is kind of simple and naive, it doesn‚Äôt disturb her when people are fighting or sad. She also calls herself Mayushii (so yes, she talks about herself at the 3rd person) and works at the Mayqueen Nyannyan as a part-time job. From time to time, Mayuri suddenly points her arm towards the sky, which is related to the time she was spending looking at the stars with her grandmother. This action will later become endearing to the viewer and could prove very emotional in the later parts of the series.
Makise Kurisu
Despite being only 18 years old, Kurisu is already famous in America for writing scientific theses often acclaimed in the news. She is a genius, specialized in neuroscience, and a research member in Victor Qondria University‚Äôs Brain Research Program. Even though she should still be in High school at her age. Acting cold and strict to not show any weaknesses, she often gets in fights with Okabe, mainly because of the nicknames he uses for her. As a proper scientist, she only thinks rationally and can‚Äôt believe in Okabe‚Äôs theories, though her very curious nature pokes her interest in some of those theories.
Sound/Music: 9% / 10%
The songs this anime chose as its opening and ending were superb. There was an ending song I couldn;t bring myself to love quite as much as the others hence the ""9"". However, ""Hacking to the Gate"" opening song perfectly matches the series theme. The vocals are strong and emotional which could be mistaken for despair but are actually full of hope. I couldn't get enough of the opening.
The voice acting for all of the characters specially Okabe is simply impressive as hell. We have exceptional voice actors and actresses that do an incredible job at voicing these marvelous characters.
Art/Animation: 15% /20%
While I can say I am an absolute fan of the art style the animation proves lacking at times where i think scenes are supposed to be they feel excluded where animation was supposed to come in. It may very well be a purposeful choice but it seemed somewhat lacking when I experienced the show for the first time.
Overall: 91% or 9.1/10",9

                ENG/PT-BR
ENG:
An anime that I thought was sensational, with several events that seem silly like taking down a toy in the first ep and in the last shows that it is important in terms of defining the destiny of that reality.
 Several mini plots involving the secondary characters that explode that micro universe and also know very well how to take advantage of these few characters, it is rare an anime that has only 11 characters in the core and develop both well.
PT-BR:

                Since there are already so many reviews extoling the merits of ""Steins;Gate"", I will focus on why it falls far short of a masterpiece.
My main issue with Steins;Gate is that it is an typical anime melodrama wrapped inside a sci-fi shell. That is, its main plot device is the main character's stupidity. I was excited when reading the synopsis that the protagonist Okabe Rintarou is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, only to find that he is an emotionally stunted college student who literally couldn't use the Scientific Method if his life depended on it.
By treating this anime as simply a drama which uses time-travel wherever convenient,
                  it becomes a lot less frustrating to sit through. I would recommend giving it a try with this caveat in mind!
Story [7/10]: Gaping plot-holes aside, the story is a fun and wild ride. It takes a lot of the run-of-the-mill drama tropes and give them a time-travel spin. For example, changing some past event conveniently wipes the memories of everyone but Okabe of some relationship-developing event, just like amnesia.
Pacing [7/10]: As infuriating as it is to watch the main character act so irrationally, the pacing of the story itself doesn't drag out.
Art [7/10]: The coloring of Steins;Gate is muted, as if viewed through polarized lenses, to give the show a darker and more serious tone (similar to movies like The Matrix). Its character drawings are elongated, so that except for the obese hacker Daru, the cast would be severely anorexic. These stylistic details aside, the artwork is well-done.
Sound [4/10]: Steins;Gate has very little background music, so the majority of the sound comes from the voice actors. Thus it was painful how annoying the two main male characters sound. When Okabe is in his mad scientist persona (i.e. most of the time), he adopts the most annoying pretentious way of speaking.
Character [4/10]: Although Steins;Gate is one of the few anime that takes place after high school, it might as well be a middle school anime considering Okabe's emotional and intellectual maturity. From the writer's point of view, what's worse is that he is inconsistent. At times (when convenient to the plot), he is trusting to a fault, but at others he is completely closemouthed. Sometimes he is cold and callous towards someone in one scene, then caring in the next.
The other characters are handled better, if only because their development largely takes place when they change some aspect of the past - that is, their character development is all behind-the-scenes. I did appreciate the relationship development. As fitful as it is, it's still better than any other anime.
Enjoyment [6/10]: After realizing that this was not going to be a smart sci-fi show, I was better able to handle its ridiculous time-travel shenanigans and the irritating main character. It also wrapped up all the threads to a nice ending. Overall, it is worth a try!
Overall: [7/10]",7

                [Spoilers Ahead]
'Steins;Gate' is one of my favourite animes of all time and I loved it from the bottom of my heart.Waching this was a truly great and memorable experience for me.
First of all,the opening of this show called 'Hacking to the gate' was a banger for me and I never skipped it.I couldn‚Äôt understand the language but still felt like singing and dancing whenever I heard it.
The characters were just right in the place for me.Each one of then had their own backstories which gave significance to the story.Okabe and Kurisu were for sure my favourite ones but I also liked everyone of them.At first,the
                  main protagonist Okabe seemed like a crazy and weird person to me for the way he acted all the time.But as the story progressed,I finally realized why he acted that way.The reason I respect him is because he's always genuinely caring about the people around him especially Kurisu,his love interest and Mayuri,his childhood friend.He always came to their rescue whenever they were in trouble which I most definitely appreciate about him.Kurisu was just 'IT' for me.The way she talked,the way she walked and the way she was always there to support Okabe,it was truly magnificent.That's how she became my most favourite waifu.Daro was the most funniest character in this show for me.The way he obsessed for his waifus made him relatable to me.Mayuri,Faris,Suzuha,Urushibara,Moeka everyone was likeable and great.
The plotline in itself was really interesting.The idea of timemachines have always came across human minds and it's not a unique concept at all,but it was still really enjoyable to me.Starting from a microwave and phonewaves to a real time-travelling machine,It really was a wonderful journey.The first few episodes might seem a bit slow-placed,but it slowly starts getting better and better and then it gets you hooked in the story.So the people who dropped this in this first few episodes missed watching a really great show in my opinion.The animation was also great and gave the storyline significance too.
I might seem a bit toxic saying such cheesy and sweet stuff for this show,but that's just how I feel about this.So if anyone feels offended,I apologise.To the peoole who dropped this or haven't watched this yet,I recommend you to definitely give it a try!I'm sure you'll appreciate it too.",10

                ""Consider, can the universe be justifiably called infinite? Doubtful. It may not have a discernible end, but it had a beginning and its component parts definitely have a limited cosmological shelf-life. Splitting hairs or not, if history tells us anything, it's that scientists often make very poor poets. We're all just a ship of fools chasing phantoms, heedless of what really underwrites natural law."" - Okabe Rintaro
(This is my first review so it might not be good, also sorry for bad english)
Amazing work, not only the really emotional story but also science behind this (which was made up but still believable) was absoulutely astounding. It
                  is truly best anime I¬¥ve seen so far. I loved unusual texture from visual novel which was has been partly preserved in anime as well. I¬¥ve found Okabes delusions and conversations with Faris funny and relatable to mine own with friends. Also his way of thinking was interesting just as the rest of anime.
 It did lack some minor character development for side characters, which however was not really noticeable due to really good storyline. That¬¥s one of good things when making a story about time travel - you can fit other parts of the story in the viewers future or make an alternative setting where it does not go the same as in original timeline. 
One of the other things i liked about Steins;Gate was that it  got me thinking about possibility of attracor fields existence and the well known string theory. I mean it is likely that multiple dimensions exist (aside from those we know).
In my opinion there were some small mistakes and reading the visual novel was more enjoyable, but they¬¥ve done a great job making this and I would love to see sequel or a view from another attractor field. Thank you for amazing experience White Fox studios (and yall too for reading this review).
I believe it was the choice of Steins gate that made this great novel come to existence.",10
"
                Mod Edit: This review contains spoilers.
I give it a 9 for how interesting this story was while not being too long for me to watch with my busy life.
Stein's Gate has a slight problem in which it can take some time for the story to pick up, roughly around 12 episodes in. If you are willing to get that far, it really starts ramping up and becoming very interesting as you see the main character trying to change the attractor field he is in.
It was very touching in particular how the main character went back in time so much to save his friends life to
                  the point that he actually got use to her dieing so much that he didn't even feel anything at that point.
Stein's Gate truly shows you consequences in actions that are done as well as explore the concept of fate. If you are looking for something that is on the topic of time travel and not too long, this is definitely worth the time to watch.",9

                Wow. Just wow. Steins;Gate.
I can't really put my thoughts about this show into words, but I can say this: do NOT drop this show before the halfway point. This show has a slow start, but it pays off marvelously.
The story was- simply put- amazing. I've never seen time travel depicted in such a digestible fashion. Somehow, it all makes sense. The rules are clear-cut and easy to follow. For the most part, the time travel logic is great, however, I did notice a problem near the end.
The presentation was mystifying. The stylistic choices made with the art and sound design (paired with the amazing story)
                  helped immerse the viewer in Okabe's stumbling through time.
I'm kind of left without words after finishing the show. I thought this was going to be another overrated so-called classic anime, but no, it really is deserving its rating on MAL. Much respect to this show's creators, and of course, the writer of the original work. And now, I guess there really isn't much else to say.
Do yourself a favor and watch this show.",10

                Um anime gostoso de assistir num fim de semana tedioso.

"
                This series really took a while to warm up for me. Based on the first two or so episodes I didn't have much hope for it, but once things started to get going I was hooked. 
I was initially very opposed to liking this anime, after reading all the massively praising reviews and comments I tried watching it and thought it was overrated. To me, it just seemed like they were trying to do a slice of life in a sci-fi setting, which really didn't work. I guess this is why you should never judge an anime by the first (few) episodes, as this idea
                  was immediately corrected. As things started to get more serious, my engagement with the series grew until I binged the entire thing in a day.
Final verdict, give it some time. If you aren't hooked after the first episode just push yourself to watch more, and it really shows why it deserves the high rating that it has.",9
"
                Why i didint like the anime:
MINOR SPOILERS
1- i was way too hyped for this anime. I mean it was in 4 place ( then i started to watch it), it was above death note and code gease ( which in my opinion are extremely good animes). Lets just say this anime overall made me fell like i didint ""finish"". Pretty disapointing. 
2- it didnt represent new ideas or theories which i havent heard before. Some people said that this anime is better then netflix series ""Dark"", well i disagree. It was so less complex than netflix series about time travel
3- This anime merely mentions about
                  resistance group in the future and how the time matchine ruined the world or something,  i felt that the creator didnt want to go there, which is sad, because i think that would have been more intresting rather than just focusing on characters which brings me to other point
4- i cant relate with characters if i dont see them struggle so first 10 episodes were just boring",5
"
                This show is breathtaking in many ways and I feel more anime should have its level of depth in characters plot and tone that it sets. 
Another impressive thing to point out is how well and fluid it handles the difficult topic of time travel which as weve seen with other failed anime is quite hard to master but the way they handle things in the plot that no one would have thought of being relevant in the story by bringing them to light and making them a first world problem for Okabe while he tries to put everything back in place and running smoothly.
                  
The way they handle the typical cliches of an anime is also quite good with them putting their own unique twist on it to make it less of a cliche and more of a good plot device to advance the story further Although I do have one or two complaints about the beginning; the main one being its painfully slow buildup for the first 9 episodes and im sure lots of you are with me on this one.
Its an anime I would definitely recommend for newer and long time anime fans who haven't seen it. 10/10 would watch again 
hope you like it :D",10

after that you start steins gate 0 whiling watching steins gate 0 you can watch steins gate 0 ova ""Valentine's of Crystal Polymorphism: Bittersweet Intermedio"" after episode 10 or episode 11
after finishing steins gate 0 you go back for the original steins gate and watch what left which episodes 23 and 24 then can watch the ova ""Egoistic Poriomania"" and the movie.
-------------
in my opinion if you still didn't start watching or planning for re-watching for better experience you should do the following:
you watch the the original steins gate till episode 22 
then you watch episode 23 beta 
after that you start steins gate 0 whiling watching steins gate 0 you can watch steins gate 0 ova ""Valentine's of Crystal Polymorphism: Bittersweet Intermedio"" after episode 10 or episode 11
after finishing steins gate 0 you go back for the original steins gate and watch what left which episodes 23 and 24 then can watch the ova ""Egoistic Poriomania"" and the movie.",10

                Steins;Gate has all the qualities of a being a classic in the future. I actually watched episode 1 a long time ago and walked away from the series, because I was younger and looked for more shounen sort of plots. Not to mention, the twist in episode one didn't get me that hooked as well as the MC was cringey to me back in the day. 
Now, I regret that. The story doesn't need a plot twist of the week attitude or super quirkiness for each character, because as you watch they receive great character development over time. Especially the main character. If it wasn't
                  near final's week, I would have surely marathon all of part two of this anime in one go, because it has you on the edge. Overall, Great Show. Great Opening. Lovable, flawed, developed characters.",10

                I structure my reviews based on 2 hierarchies. The first is judged on my own personal Rewatchability and/or conversational ability(able to be talked about or discussed). The second is judged on Worldbuilding/Characters, Story/Plot, and Cinematography/Direction(art, sound, animation).
For the first, I thoroughly enjoyed the show from beginning to end, and each time I rewatch it, it adds to the experience instead of taking away from it. The bigger picture also presents itself as something worth discussing, whether it's about time travel, the characters, or the plot itself.
For the second,
The world and its characters are fleshed out enough that I was satisfied by the end of it.
                  They were all unique and interesting characters that had a special place within the show. The plot allows the audience to grow alongside Okabe, and to experience the rollercoaster of emotions that this show brings.
The story and plot this anime provides are subtle and with great payoffs. There were many moments I kept details in the back of my mind never expecting them to be of plot relevance, but to my surprise, the story never misses a beat on its runtime.
The cinematography also adds to the atmosphere and minuteness of the anime. The art is beautifully animated and the scenes where even just casual dialogue is taking place, the background and surroundings proved to be rememberable and non-confusing. The sound design is excellent and the opening song is one of my favorites to come back to in anime.
I give this a 10 all around.",10

                this anime is really overrated like jesus. before I actually get to making points about the aspects of the series, i just wanna say that even my grandpa in a coma wouldn't wake up to just watch this no matter how much praise it gets. i enjoy science a lot and I got preetty good grades on it too so I thought that maybe this really is the show for me, but I WAS WRONG!!!! im never going to even try this series again and here is why.
story: the story literally went nowhere and im pretty sure it wouldnt have gone anywhere anyway. there are
                  so many plot holes in just 12 episodes like episode 1 was a complete mess and explained nothing. just in the first episode I already felt like this wont even be the anime for me. i expected time travel but instead i get some 30 year old crazy loser send messages to himself in the past with his overweight friend. like how lonely can you be tbh?
art: I kinda liked it, but it felt too old. they shouldve waited like until 2018 or something before animating this thing anyway. the characters are kinda boring looking and the lab coat looks ugly on okabe and especially that red haired lady. i forgot her name because she is so forgetable anyway. only good design is the cat maid.
sound: the opening is kinda good, but there isn't really much any other good music. it felt like listening to radio in a car or something sometiems expect its not radio music but TRASH. the sound effects were kinda meh, just birds chirping or some shit.
character: theyre all one dimensional boring characters. okabe is mentally insane, mauri brings more depression than fixes it because she hangs out with these weirdos. red hair lady (cant bother to check name again) is tsundere and the nerd is fat. faris is kinda cute and ruka is makes me question my sexuality. braun is kinda ugly.
enjoyment: it felt like it mayyyyybe couldve had some potential to be cool. I heard its kinda sad and scientific but instead I got this stupid slice of life trash instead. had to even quit early episode 12 because I felt like I'm wasting my time. as someone who got good grades in my 7th grade science quiz, I thought this was an anime to someone who is good at science like me. I guess i can see why some people like but imo its kinda shit. just some boring microwave phone slice of life thing.
from whatt I understood, the anime and visual novel was just an advetisemtn for doctor pepper. I don't even like the soda which makes me drop the score by one point. like why not drink pepsi instead or even sprite? anyway thanks for reading.",2

                Many otaku only watch anime because it's anime. While there's nothing inherently wrong with that, Steins;Gate is not in that category. You shouldn't watch Steins;Gate just because it's anime. You should watch it because it's good. Both otaku and newcomers can enjoy this show.
Steins;Gate is a thriller. A thriller intends to invoke great excitement in the viewer using an intricate, suspenseful plot, rather than raw action.  This anime achieves that goal with perfection. Every episode had me wanting more, leading to my completion of the series within two days. I was on the edge of my seat for most of it. Steins;Gate is brimming
                  with mystery, suspense, and a load of plot twists.
You will be told that the first half is ""slow-paced"" or ""boring"". Don't listen to anyone who says that. The first half is more focused on character development, which doesn't have to be boring with such lovable, eccentric, unique characters. Watching the mystery of an organization called SERN unfold should be entertaining to anyone who enjoys the plot rather than raw, vapid action.
Time travel isn't easy to pull off as a plot device. Many things in Steins;Gate are hard to pull off, including time travel, a mad scientist character, and a phone microwave which turns bananas into gelatin as an important part of the story. But it just works. I took it seriously.
One feature of Steins;Gate which is important to mention is its COMIC RELIEF. This show is abundant in comedy in the beginning, before taking a darker turn. When this show chooses to be funny, it does so better than any comedy anime I've seen. The recurring jokes manage to never grow old due to tasteful timing and delivery (rather than being constant and forced). Don't forget the Engrish. Lots of good Engrish.
Steins;Gate can be a tearjerker. Media almost never invokes a deep emotional reaction in me. It's just not something that affects me because it's fictional.  This anime, however, was one of the most emotionally effective on me. The audience will become so empathetic towards the characters, who were flawed, yet believably good people. Then, as the characters go through psychological pain and suffering, we feel for them.
The art. Wew. It feels truly organic. Many anime have a sort of animation which feels mass-produced and artificial. This is not one of those. Each character has an appearance which reflects their personality. They have different faces, which is uncommon in this day and age. The colors are subtle but pleasant to look at. Don't get me wrong, I love bright colors, but the somewhat dark appearance of Steins;Gate feels more realistic. It's also worth mentioning how their eyes are drawn. It's quite distinctive and visually appealing.
Whoever you are, you should definitely watch this show. It should be a one of a kind experience, whether or not you're an otaku. As long as you're willing to keep up with a complicated story, I'd even recommend it as a starter anime.",10

                Steins;Gate is definetly one of the best animes I have ever seen and has an amazing plot that will blow your minds.
Story: 10/10
This story is awesome! Steins;Gate is about Okabe Rintarou, a  scientist who spends his time hanging out in his laboratory with his friends Mayuri and Daru. Ocassionally, they manage to invent futuristic gadgets. The story of Steins;Gate is a unique and detailed time travel story, it starts off as a relatively slow paced show, however, it is this initial slow pace that introduces and explores the various characters of the series. This plays to excellent effect in the later episodes while exploring
                  the characters in depth. Piece by piece, the mystery of the events that happen is unveiled, working towards a fantastic ending. 
Art: 10/10
Steins;Gate is a thought provoking series, and by using the art and animation to give the viewer time to breath and take in everything that is going on.
Sound: 9.5/10
Amazing voice acting and nice opening. There were some moments where I think there could have been made better use of background music.
Characters: 10/10
The characters have their own likeable and recognizable traits, which are perfectly described from the start. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, then you will surely enjoy this anime. You won't waste your precious time watching Steins Gate.
Overall 10/10;
Watching Steins;Gate is an experience that I don't think I will ever match again when watching anime. The story, the art, the sound, and especially the characters combine to create a fantastic story.",10
"
                This anime is certainly the best anime I've ever watched in the last 2 years. There are many plot twists and unpredictable events occurring.
It is a sci-fi anime, about a scientist and his lab members that invented the time machine. 
I gave this anime all 5 stars because it's not draggy at all, the characters are fun and they have different accents (kudos to their seiyuu), add to that a brilliant storyline and state-of-the-art animation. Also, the story is one that we can definitely relate to - there's no stupid fantasy made-up special moves like Kamehames or Hadoukens or Bankai or Kage-Bunshin no Jutsu. It's
                  based completely on the present world. I must say the main character is one of the most awesome main characters we've had in recent years. An end to an episode always leaves me wondering what will happen next, and on almost every episode I got chills just from watching it. You can try to look at the comments of other users on each episode - almost all of them praised this series as one of the most awesome series they have watched. 
I must warn you though that the beginning can be a bit confusing, but it just leaves you thinking, and makes you want to watch the next episodes to find out what happened and get an understanding. This series will leave you wanting more!
This series is most similar to Death Note, but without the shinigamis and those fantasies. If you like Death Note, you'll definitely love this one. Comparing the two - I prefer THIS ONE over Death Note any day!

                I love time travel movies.
One of my reasons for this is because I like to watch writers having to deal with the inevitable paradox. While the science behind the time travel in steins gate is sort of meh, it doesn't matter (time travel is not possible in real life you guys), because its logic consistency is excellent. It is not primer (the most ""realistic"" time travel movie of all time), but the the logic behind the time travel in steins gate serves the story so well, you will not be bothered looking for paradox at all
The only problem I have here is that at some
                  point people start ""remembering"" small bits of information from other time lines. It happens very late, and  serves for the characters to retain relationships with each other through out the time lines. While I can see how this is a bit boring, it does however serve the purpose of removing the oh so tired ""chosen one"" trope from the main character, since remembering across timelines is sort of his thing.
The story is excellent, the main character gets to meet a lot of characters, and somehow influences their lives with his time travel, it creates tension, drama and emotions each episode.
As a last positive mention, I just want to write about the main character. Okabe is so great. While he is a true hero, brave, always doing the right thing. He can do this while retaining an original personality. His speech and interactions with others could carry this show alone. I have only seen the English dub, I hope the Japanese version of Okabe is just as good, but I honestly can't imagine it being better than the English one.
Steins is a 9 out of 10 for me, the small problem I have with this show lies in the characters outside of Okabe. Some of them are very bland. You will instantly know which ""anime girl archtype"" fits each female character, and there is really nothing which sets them apart from the other uninspired females of anime. This is however not a big deal in my opinion, as it is very rare to find interesting (original) female characters in anime",9
"
                This is by far my favorite anime. It can be a bit slow at the start if you don't care for slice of life, but personally I think all of its enjoyable and that its important to have the first 12 episodes to build up the characters and their relationships to give the last 12 episodes their great payoffs. 
The story grabbed my attention very quickly with its interpretation of time travel and the intricacies of how it worked with world lines. The show does a perfect job of mixing show and tell in a way that feels natural and doesn't make the watcher feel
                  stupid or spoon fed. It flows extremely well through the story and didn't feel like there was any filler. Everything is important either for character development or to develop the plot.
I wouldn't call myself an expert on art by any means so this is really just down to personal preference but I found it really appealing and beautiful. The character designs were great.
The Opening, Ed, and background sound of this show is amazing. I would rate it up there with Death note as having the greatest sound of an anime. It always perfectly added to the atmosphere and made the experience more powerful.
The characters are amazing in my opinion. They may start off as one note to some but they all evolve and are given proper development as the series goes on. Furthermore their relationships all feel really natural with no moments of contradiction to their characters for the service of the plot (that I noticed).
I binged it in two days and always felt hooked. The cliff hangers did a perfect job of keeping you interested and allowing you to binge so easily.
This is a must see anime for anyone interested in science fiction. Watch it!",10
"
                tl;dr: Steins;Gate is an amazing and breathtakingly well-crafted anime that will charm and capture the viewer so long as they are willing to look past one or two minor plot inconsistencies.
Steins;Gate is one of those anime that literally pops up everywhere. Everyone talks about how good it was, (except for those who couldn‚Äôt get past the admittedly slow first few episodes) and it‚Äôs probably on most ‚Äúmust watch‚Äù lists. After having it recommended to me several times, I decided to give it a go after a thankfully short phase of more...let‚Äôs say humorous *coughhentaicough* anime, and let me say, it was a great re-introduction into
                  the world of story-driven anime. I stayed up until the late hours of the night while I binged this show over the period of three days, and it was all I could do to think about anything else.  Reality became cold and lifeless, and time seemed to stand still. (Thankfully, I‚Äôve finished it just in time to cram for finals this week lol.)
First off, I love how well it‚Äôs stood the test of time. S;G is an older anime, though not quite as old as my childhood classics, Pok√©mon, Digemon, etc. However, it‚Äôs aged remarkably well. Our understanding of space-time models hasn‚Äôt really progressed so much as developed new, arguable more complicated theories, so the pseudo-science in the anime cannot yet be refuted (at least not by a leyman like myself). The animation is beautiful and surprisingly well-crafted; I think I would compare its style to Attack on Titan, just with pout the heavy lines that Titan sports. And the music, although probably the most dated part of this show, is still very enjoyable, and so you don‚Äôt really notice how different it is after the first few episodes.
Now, speaking of those first few episodes, I hear that this anime is often dropped because it fails the three-episode test. For anyone who espouses this test, I would urge you to make an acception here. I personally found the first few episodes very enjoyable, as Okabe is a hilarious character and world building is a big part of why I watch anime; however, I can see why people wouldmget bored and would suggest that they just treat it like Madoka Magica and wait until episode four when crap really hits the fan.
Sudden change of subject: I love the characters in this show. This show would not be the same without them. I haven‚Äôt loved characters like this, even shedding tears (I mean...liquid pride, of course) over their achievements and failures since I watched Akame ga Kill several months ago ‚Äî and even Akame ga Kill only made me cry once or twice, whereas S;G probably brought me to choke five times at least. I won‚Äôt spoil it for you why, but by the end, you‚Äôll have gone on a meaningful journey with these characters, and that‚Äôs an awesome feeling.
Now to the part that I hat to bring up but I must, in order to be honest in my review. Cue gigantic spoiler warning.
SPOILERS AHEAD SPOILERS AHEAD SPOILERS AHEAD SPOILERS AHEAD
Okay. There are several points in the anime where I had to take a breath and come up with why this made any sense (which is a little dangerous for the writers, but not really a problem per se), and for all but two I could find a reason. These were: 1. After Okabe tracks down FB and finds out she‚Äôs really Mr. Brahn, and everyone dies, how does Okabe then send a D-Mail if no one is at the phone wave? This was just kind of left out there as the elephant in the room and i pt bugged me. At first I wrote it off as a fluke like the first one, but then the story was so kind as to remind me that the first one went through because Daru just happened to be using the phone wave just then for something else. So...annoying plot holes are annoying, but it‚Äôs nowhere near as bad as most superhero movies, so okay. And 2. How the crap did nobody find the first time machine?? This one really bugged me. CERN must be a bunch of doodoo buckets, because the key to their success was literally on the freaking news 24/7. It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to hypothesize that the satellite that appears out of thin air at a conference to DISCUSS TIME TRAVEL with the FOREMOST EXPERTS IN THR FIELD OF TIME TRAVEL at which ONE OF THEM FREAKING DIES, leading to her crackpot father publishing a brilliant thesis on time travel OUT OF FREAKING NOWHERE COULD MAYBE BE A TIME MACHINE. Like I said, it bugged me a lot that they never even brought it up. In this day and age with terrorism and crap, the police and every Illuminati wannabe would be on that thing like a squirrel on birdseed.
Other than those two gripes, I absolutely loved it! 10/10 would watch again.",10
"
                Every time I think to myself ""what is my favorite anime?"" I'm haunted by this masterpiece as my answer. Admittedly there's some nostalgia backed behind this review, and my experience is of course subjective, but this anime remains my favorite to this day. So, the review begins.
Story:
So, I mustn't spoil. The story is complex, but when one stands back and looks at the whole picture, they'll find a masterpiece. From beginning to end this anime had me locked in, making the mistake of watching this on a school night when I was in high school led me to pulling an all nighter and then faking
                  sick the next day. Don't judge, I know I'm not the only one ;), and besides it was that good (-_^)b. 10/10.
Art:
So for its time, Steins;Gate still holds competitive animation with modern day anime. Not saying that the sands of time can kill animation, just that if someone told me that Steins;Gate's animation looks 2018 worthy, I'd be inclined to agree. 10/10.
Sound:
I very much enjoyed the intro 10/10.
Character:
It is hard not to spoil this section, because what we find are very real tangible characters with ambitions and relatable emotions. It's easy to dive in debt and explain each character and why they're important, heck the supporting characters are the gravy on the mashed potatoes, the peanut butter to the peanut butter and jelly sandwich... hang on *gets food...* But you get my point, all characters are beautifully integrated as a staple in the story to make it the marvel of story telling it is. 10/10.
Enjoyment:
I won't bore anyone who is still here with too many details, I enjoyed this anime greatly. Don't get me wrong, back in the day I'd skip school for just about anything, but if I had found this anime today I'd be inclined to miss my own birthday to finish it lol.  This anime truly spoiled me, it's honestly the highlight of my anime watching experience. 10/10.
Overall:
I've had anime come close to dethroning it, but I'll stick to it, waiting for a worthy anime to take its place. It's a work of art as far as I'm concerned, and I loved it 10/10. 
- Special thanks to myanimelist for granting me the power to write a review, this is my first review and it won't be my last, you guys rock!",10
"
                Its so amazing. The characters are great and the environment is great. The story is great and I love the Romance too. (and I don't normally like romance). I love all the characters to death and the environment feels like your home too. Its animated really well and the art style is fantastic. Even though I love action, this anime had barely any so you know that its good if I give it a 10.I really appreciate all the ways they progress the story and the characters. A Lot of the time there are character scenes and plot scenes but this anime is able to
                  combine them to create an amazing mix of everything. Do yourself a favor and watch it ASAP. drop everything now and see it.",10
"
                This is my first review and to be honest it will be more like an advice or a warning than a review. If you're reading reviews to get an idea of the anime before watching, I hope this one will be a good help to you.
I started watching Steins;Gate because of its high ranking and when I checked the reviews before start, I saw warnings about its slow start. This review will purely focus on this issue. No need to beat around the bush; first 5-6 episodes are really boring but you need to grit your teeth and survive those because this anime really deserves
                  its high ranking. If you are interested in time travel at all you will find this anime interesting and can't wait to watch the next episode after you finish the last.
In concluison, I gave it a 9 because of the slow start but I think anybody who likes to watch anime should watch it especially if time travel intrigues you.This whole review is written as a warning for fellow anime watchers to not give up at first few boring episodes because when you finish it, you will be happy that you watched it and you probably will think it's one of the best animes you've ever watched.
P.S. you don't need to watch  Chaos;Head before watching Steins;Gate. It is alternative settings and totally unrelated. You won't miss out on anything.",9
"
                What can be said about Steins:Gate that haven't been said before? 
It's with no doubt one of the best animes I have seen, and it was a joy for me to watch it with my followers on Youtube. What starts as a light-hearted and humorous story, gets more twists and turns with each episode.
It is overall just outstanding, and with a stor that is so driven and interesting, as well loveable characters, do I heavily suggest this show. It gave me so much thought, making me think and build theories as the show progressed, forcing me to continue seeing the show.
And I have no regrets
                  doing that. It is simply an outstanding show, and I can't say more than that!",10

                WHY YOU SHOULD WATCH STEINS;GATE (SPOILER FREE REVIEW)
Steins;Gate is a sci-fi anime series that tackles the genre of time travel. The story follows the character of Okabe or as he likes to call himself ""Hououin kyouma"". He claims himself to be a mad scientist and owns what he calls ""the future gadget lab, which really is just an apartment. The two other members of this lab are his childhood friend Mayushii and a nerdy hacker named Daru. The three members usually hang out in the lab and make gadgets, like ""Bit Particle Cannon"" or the ‚ÄúBamboo-copter Camera‚Äù. One day at a radio building, Okabe find
                  the body of a dead girl lying in a pool of blood. In his shock he text Daru to tell what he saw. At the same time that Okabe sends the text, his friend has connected his phone to the microwave, which is currently under experimentation. For some reason this leads to the fact that Okabe's message gets sent 5 days into the past. After this, he discovers that the world around him has suddenly changed, and the girl he thought was dead, shows up the very next day. What will they do to the machine they accidently created? What are the consequences of messing with time? Can they ever undo the things they've changed? 
Steins;gate asks a lot of questions, and can get extremely complicated trying to understand the details. Writing a whole series of the acts of time travel is extremely hard, and the writers of this show pulled that off unbelievably well. I can still read and learn new things about the details of Steins;gate's timeline. Instead of just tackling one part of time travel like in ""The butterfly effect"" or ""Predestination"", Steins;gate covers up almost all of them, in a way that actually makes sense without causing any paradoxes. The show does take philosophical steps too, but never get throwed too much off guard. This is very much so a suspense thriller as it is a sci-fi. What I hear most people complain about is that the first half of the series are very slow, and feels more like a ""slice of life"" anime. I do agree that the second half of the show is much better than the first half, but I completely disagree in the statement that the first half is boring. I always found myself invested in the plot. There was always something new happening in every episode concerning the plot. We got to know the characters, how they interacted with each other, what they are like and so on. What is a show if you don't like the characters? You are going to spend about 10 hours with these people, what's the point of caring when something happens to them if you don't know them? And when the characters DO experience consequences, then you feel for them and you care when you see people break into despair and want them to succeed. I can tell you that everything is building up to something, and that something is unbelievable good. You have to pay attention to the story even if you think that it is slow, and if you are not getting into it, watch episode 12 and after that, you can judge if you should continue or not. The dialogue feels also extremely fresh and natural. The characters talk right after what their personality reflect, and they never break character, you just see new aspects of their persona. Don't go into this expecting action every minute. you CAN however go into this expect and extremely emotional series which is vastly original and hard to predict.
As for the English dub, if you don‚Äôt like Japanese dubs (which is fine) you CAN watch the English version, but you WILL miss out on something, because the voice acting in the Japanese dub are the best voice acting I‚Äôve ever heard in an animated movie or show, and I don‚Äôt even speak Japanese. The English dub also ruins a little bit of the personality of Okabe. Instead of sounding like a mad scientist, he sounds like a poet, which is not a plus. The voice of one particular red haired character is also a little bit too bitchy in the English version. There are a few voices in the English version though, that I think are equally good to the Japanese, and that is the voice of Mayshii, Daru, Feris, Suzuha and Rukako. 
It‚Äôs hard to express how much I love Steins;Gate. It sticks with you days after, hell even months. You want to read about it, you want more of it, it is too good to be true. And if you think that time travel is exciting, than it is an absolute MUST WATCH. Steins;Gate has some of the most intens moments where your hearts stop beating, you get chills down your spine, and your insides starts to burn. It is original. It is suspenseful. It is very funny in the first half. The characters are some of the best, ever. The main character of Okabe has the best character-arc I‚Äôve seen in an anime. Every character serve a purpose. The story is cohesive. The artistry is thought provoking. The music is immensely great and is used at all the right spots to send chills down your spine. You will cry, you will laugh, you will be shocked, you will love it. It is THAT good. But you have to know what you are in for before watching it. I  have tried to keep this review out of as much spoilery as possible, but I have to note out that the interactions and the chemistry between our main guy and a redheaded girl are incredible, unbelievable and insanely, spectacularly good. 
Guys, Steins;Gate is a work of genius, you are missing out of something. It is a 50% chance you‚Äôll give it a 10/10 according to the rating stacks. If you respect good entertainment, watch it. You will not get disappointed.",10

                So it appears that I am reviewing this Japanese animation in 2020.
The anime is steins gate
Characters:
You have a nerd, another nerd, and another nerd, as well as a girl who is not a nerd but a Japanese weeabo. She is decently likeable and I know opinions vary . There are more characters  but they are irrelevant to this anime. Apparently there is a visual novel which I think is like a choose your own adventure but somehow they are online and not actually a novel (again I am not one of those anime guys, how would I know). Well if you experienced the visual
                  novel then move on to a different review for this anime. 
OK, so I filtered out the nostalgic bunch who came to see the reviews after 10 years of the animations' release so let's proceed. So basically the 3 nerds I was talking about vary as one is a conspiracy nut, one is a hacker, and the other is an attractive 2d character (of the female variety) with a scientific background. It's cool that these nerds develop. As for the Japanese weebo she does not develop. You can hiss your teeth at what I wrote in the last sentence but at the end of the day I don't think there is a comment section which allows you to respond. Also, why would you be reading this if you already know the characters? Come on guys (and girls. Can't forget that anime is a very diversified source of enjoyment - diversified with respect to the two genders that I know to enjoy it). 
Sorry for straying off topic. Logical views aside, I have to review the sound, because I am not trying to spoil this by talking too much about the characters.
The character category gets a 10 because of two characters that carried the entire series. I give those two characters 'goat status [overriding any other bad character scores].'  
Sound:
Not to put down Japanese culture or anything, but as a non-Japanese speaker speech in anime sounds like a bunch of high pitched squealing. I realize that is probably not how most Japanese people talk, but it annoys me and Stein's gate is no exception. Yes, I watched most of this on mute. Quick tip: if unsure of what parts to mute, follow these instructions: mute any girl except for the one with red hair. There's this one girl who makes this annoying noise which is irritating, it might mean something in Japanese (it rhymes with choo choo choo) but no spoilers here. At the end of the day I don't know enough about Japanese culture to analyze this so I will ignore it. 
WARNING: The bicycle girl is by far one of the biggest/worst squeakers in anime history. I could give the others a pass, but she has cost the anime 5 (five) points in terms of sound. This is coming from someone who failed music in middle school (I played the viola, a widely unknown string instrument that is a mix between a cello and a violin). 10-5= 5 points out of a possible ten points in the sound category.
Art:
Honestly the art in most anime look the same to me, so I give it the benefit of the doubt and will err on the higher range. Unfortunately, the characters were conservatively dressed. Now I am definitely going to dock points for this because there is no excuse for anime studios to not appease what I know as the larger male demographic. In that aspect I could at least give a decent rating. Therefore the show loses 3 points for the art category. I expect more from all anime now, knowing through research I conducted ten minutes ago that anime episodes costs north of 100,000 US dollars to produce apiece. The clothing problem may be amended in the OVA but it's too late now. In retrospect it is easier to focus on the plot in this type of situation than in another anime that I would give a 10/10 for art, but that's for another review. As for the art, the lines are pretty thick and the characters dont really have too much detail, but I appreciate that the main character doesn't have the classic lowlife anime protagonist haircut. The drawing style of Stein's gate doesn't phase me, which is not a bad thing given that the physical appearance of characters is not (in my opinion) the driving point of this film. I have to give credit where it is due. The art quality in that sense does not alter my opinion of the show, so it will not impact the score. This show does not have to be beautifully drawn. Final art score: 7/10. 
Enjoyment/Story: 
Despite the scores in the other categories, I felt like I was smart as I watched the episodes and watched the fiascos unravel. I don't really understand what happened, but won't say anymore to avoid spoilers. It was enjoying and this doesn't have to be in a positive way, as I consider a rewarding anime to be enjoying. This anime was definitely rewarding. Whoever made the story was a perfectionist. I mean no it's not perfect as you can see from my ratings but at the end of the day you can feel common emotions like compassion, sadness, and relief. I was moderately unhappy to finish this anime but I didn't force myself through it at the end, only for the first couple of episodes before I grew attached to two of the characters. 10/10 for sure. 
OVERALL
The overall score is the most important because it uses a different criteria. I am not a bandwagoner by any means. In fact I am going to go out of my way to say that I am NOT THAT INTERESTED IN ANIME! You would catch me as a prostitute in Thailand before I bought a body pillow. That is an issue in itself for another time. I gave the overall score a 10 out of 10 because the story is deep, leaves a lot to the imagination, has rewatching potential, and it will definitely help me find out whether I am compatible with another person. I will say it right now, I am a nitpicky guy. I don't hand out 10/10 ratings. There were some issues with the anime but I still highly recommend that you, the viewer, watch the anime and then reflect on what I wrote - was fx-trading room's review a load of horse shit? Or was he spitting facts?",10

                Steins;Gate was originally a visual novel and it became an anime. This anime has been praised heavily by a lot around the world and it deserves such praise. Why? The complexity and the plot twists it told made me wonder what's gonna happen next? If (?) will stay dead or not? If Okarin will be happy in the end? This anime has sparked my interest to learn more about physics again. HOWEVER,this is one of those animes that I DO NOT recommend you to watch again. This has the WOW factor like Clannad. The first experience is always the best. Overall,I would recommend this to
                  anyone who is even a little bit interested in time travel or just love sci-fi animes.",10

Steins;Gate
There is so much I can say about this anime. It has been a while since I watched something so
finely crafted and
                  impactful as Steins;Gate. I find it hard to believe that it took me so long
to watch this anime. I finally decided to watch it after seeing it be ranked 2 on the anime list.
I must admit though, I was close to dropping this anime after watching the first few episodes.
I wouldn't say they were boring or bad, but lackluster as I expected it to be great from the 
start. I guess I had too much high expectations, but once it got to episode 9, that is one
things really started to hit you. From there I was hooked and had to binge watch the rest
because I couldn't put it off. I rarely binge watch shows since I don't have the time, but
I made sure to stay up most of the night to finish it. However, like all great things,
they must come to an end. My only regret is that I can't watch it for the first time
again.
Story: 10
If you want a summary of the anime, you can just look it up as I will only give my thoughts
on the story. Whenever a story involves time and the concept of time travel, it is always
interesting, and I seem to always be drawn to those type of stories. However, not all
stories dealing with time are great and it can get pretty complicated if not done properly.
The good thing is that the creators pulled off the story magnificently and it was not complicated
if you paid attention. It really put in perspective of the dangers that can result in
messing with time (if time travel was possible). I think they handled the ending pretty well too
as it ended, in my opinion, the best possible way.
Art: 8
I think this is the only part where the anime hindered on.
The art and animation was nothing grand or amazing, but that is not to say that it was bad because it is far from being bad. Considering the budget they had, they did an awesome job and I really loved the character designs for each of the characters.
Even though this is not related to the anime; the art and design of the characters from
the visual novel is really good, and I love that type of art style. I only wish that I knew what 
was the name of that type of art style.
Sound: 9
The voice acting was phenomenal and each had this sort of distinct voice that fit each of the characters perfectly (Japanese VA). The music was really good too with, the opening and ending theme being my favorites.
The only thing that is holding back this 10/10, was that in some scenes in which the background music could have been better, but that is simply my opinion on the matter.
Characters: 10
It is very rare when both the story and characters are threaded together so perfectly like this.
I felt like I bonded so much with each character throughout the anime. I must admit that, referring to my initial comment of dropping the show, the characters were the ones that kept me watching the  show. Usually it is the other way around, as the characters are unpleasant, but the story is what keeps me going. The character development was fantastic, especially the protagonist, Okabe Rintarou. Creating characters and relationships are not an easy thing to do, and usually it is the thing that can make or break a story. I praise the creators for developing such a great cast of characters the deeply resounded with one another.
Enjoyment: 10
What else can I say about Steins;Gate that I already haven't? It's just such a great anime that I can't  help but give it all this praise. I am told that I am really picky and hard to please when it comes to  watching anime or movies. I simply just have a hard time trying to find something to critique on Steins;Gate  since it is near perfection. Well I'll stop my gratification here, hopefully you can all enjoy and appreciate Steins;Gate just as much as I did.
My Rating: 10 (Masterpiece)
Thanks for reading :~)",10
"
                At this point, there are plenty of new shows out there. Ones with better art, flashier characters and edgier stories. In comparison, Steins;Gate is a science fiction anime where the characters still all use flip phones. But passing on this series for any of the above reasons will mean missing out on one of the best shows you could watch, one that has every bit earned its rating and reputation. 
If there's a reason why you won't enjoy Steins;Gate, it's this: delayed gratification. The initial episodes will feel slow, and we can run into a curious feeling of getting both too much and too little
                  information. We're often left in the dark on things such as existing character relationships, motivations, and where our plot is supposed to be headed, and instead handed assorted facts and scattered short arcs. There's unfortunately no way around this, no skipping to X episode. If you do, you'll miss out on the magic that makes Steins;Gate what it is.
It's no secret that that this show revolves around time travel. And with it comes all your standard time travel accompaniments and themes such the butterfly effect, predetermination and causality. It's this topic that allows the show to build the narrative it does, and helps make the slow burn of the first episodes eventually so worth it. But Steins;Gate also does a wonderful job of keeping time travel from dominating the show. It's not a series of fancy plot twists or clever gimmicks based on time travel. It's a story from beginning to end. One with characters that you might not always learn the backstories too, but that you'll definitely love, and an emotional depth that comes naturally as you get more and more invested.
At its heart, Steins;Gate isn't about science, but it is about everything science-fiction should be. It's about using its setting to tell a story that otherwise couldn't be told, drawing out emotions and setting up very real choices in an unreal setting. It has it's fair share of pseudoscience and gaps in logic. But somewhere along the way, as you hear Okabe utter his nonsensical and very unscientific catchphrase, ""El Psy Kongroo"" for the 15th time, you'll find that it means something to you. Isn't that all that really matters?",9
"
                I watched this with no prior knowledge, which I think is really the key for this one.  A lot of reviews seemed disappointed because they felt it didn't live up to the hype and that seems fair to me, but I'm not a regular watcher of anime (yet!) and had never heard of it before watching.
I watched this over the course of one night, with a friend at his recommendation. 
We had only planned to watch a few episodes, but every time I found myself saying ""maybe just one more"" until suddenly it was 5am and he was crying into my shoulder.  It's
                  that kind of deal.
I think the strength of this anime lies in its characters and their relationships - sure, there's enough hyperbole that it still feels like a cartoon but the subtle ways the characters soften and strengthen each other really has something meaningful to say.  I think there's a lesson in human connection for viewers at any stage of life in this story, and that's usually what I'm looking for in cinema which is something I have been more interested in than anime until recently.
If you're looking for a beautifully animated, action packed, hilarious, high-budget classic 10 star, then yes, you'll probably feel a little cheated by this one.
If, however, you're a jaded 20-something who just needs to feel something in the midst of a pandemic, a housing crisis and a recession then maybe you'll find some real comfort in this.
A side-note, I'd highly recommend this for older viewers.  Not to say that it's unsuitable for younger audiences at all, but I often find myself watching shows with friends that centre around high-school drama and such (I'm looking at YOU, Chunnibyou) and while they can be fun it never really engages me because I'm just not in touch with that sort of a plot.  If you're a little older and feel this way too, then this is a show with some real weight that might be worth a try.
I loved it.  I understand why someone might not, but for me this really was something special and I hope I've convinced at least one person to give it a go.",10
"
                Oh look, it's an anime for nerds! Boi, who loves this kind of ****? Nerds? Weebs? As if that's enough to make me interested.
*12 hours later*
Oh... But, I hate science(personally)...
Steins;Gate is the 2nd VN in the series ""Science Adventure""(sounds like a dumb kids game, no?) and then made into an anime, following the original route(I'm pretty sure it's the original route, but I'll have to play the game to know, kek.). Basically, I'm not really into this kind of genre where science and nerd/weeb jokes are strong, but seeing how many memes and how much rating it had in MAL, I decided to give it
                  a try, and now that I know what it is all about, I believe it deserves the ratings it already had.
Story
The first parts of the anime are your usual character introduction. You'll learn who are they, what they do, where they're from, why and how did they meet, that usual stuff. It isn't enough to tell me that it deserves the score it already had, but then the middle part of the anime gets interesting. It is somehow comparable to ""All You Need is Kill"", it only lacks action, but there's still is action in it, so I have no complains there, and oh, it's more ""wordy"". I would say that I'm against anime with more dialogues than action, but if we're talking about Steins;Gate, well, it's a blessing inside my 2nd most hated genre(1st would be Romance because of cliche and stuff like that). As it goes deeper, I discarded the comparison of this and All You Need is Kill and then replaced it with Astro Boy. Why? Well, if you do know what the main plot of Astro Boy is all about, you don't need to know why.
Art
Dark, gloomy, this isn't your usual Akihabara. You think Akihabara is all cheery and such, but in all honesty, it's a mixed bag, in which Steins;Gate illustrated it quite well. The character designs are also good and creative, the animation is not really a big hit in this kind of anime, but I think it's okay.
Sound
I gave this a 10 not because of the typical sounds you hear inside the anime, but because of the Opening and the Ending. The Opening did a great job explaining what we're facing with, while the ending, on the other hand, well, it's intellectual and rad at the same time, that's all I can say.
Character
This is where the anime excels. Character Development, Character Design, Personality, it's all there. In fact, almost all characters are likable. You just can't hate them(well, there are 2 which can be hated, but I do understand them both, so meh.) There are also a lot of plot twist in there, which brings a ""don't trust anyone""feels.
Enjoyment
I enjoyed it, surprisingly. Normally, it would make me bored and such. The first parts, actually, is boring IMO, but somehow I can't help but enjoy the protagonist's fantasy. And then after some dreaming and such, it became dark real fast. PTSD is present here, so ye.
Overall, it's near to perfect. This is the 2nd anime I gave a perfect 10. I am satisfied and happy that I watched this nerdy ass show.",10
"
                Time travel! Isn't this concept so tired of being used now? The world of entertainment has seen time travel shows come and go, and so many things have been tried to twist things around with most of it being a hit or miss for me. I wondered how the highly-acclaimed Steins;Gate would fare so there I was, underwhelmed to start it.
I just want you to know that I usually watch a series without reading the synopsis. Yes, I frequently judge things by their covers but certainly not for this one. I watched it for its score. A whopping 9.17 here in MAL! And, it's ranked
                  #2 at that. I didn't read the plot or synopsis given. I rushed into it.
Honestly, it took me a year to finish Steins;Gate. The first half just wasn't ""it"" for me, you know? I began to realize that I was forcing myself to watch Steins;Gate for the sake of finishing it and for the privilege to be able to say that I have seen the praised Steins;Gate. The first half bored me to death so as such, it took me six months before continuing to watch the second half. And wow, it blew me away and to be more specific, it violently blew my heart away. I really would have given my enjoyment a 10/10 but the first half really killed me. 
The story was one of the most well-crafted time-travel plots that I have ever seen or read, and the situations along with the characters were gripping. You could hear me shouting from the top of my lungs in excitement or nervousness during the most part of the second half. It was so brilliantly done, my emotions could not bear it.
I was never the analyst or the critic. I never found joy in crticizing an anime or meticulously analyzing it. For me, I watch things to feel. To feel. That's why I just want to give the ultimate praise to Steins;Gate for being able to make me feel in the highest. During the last few episodes, I bawled my eyes out, shockingly. I don't think you understand. The last time I did was when I watched Clannad: After Story. The emotions just welled up inside me and I violently sobbed my heart out for the characters and the struggles they were forced to face. I've already cried many times in other show after Clannad but  the deepest, truest cries has only ever been given to Clannad and now, Steins;Gate. It hit me too hard, it seems. For that, I applaud Steins;Gate for because of it, I was able to do what I want to best, to feel.
This proves that I think everyone will enjoy something in Steins;Gate. By all means, Steins;Gate is indeed a sci-fi show but if you're more into drama, you'd be able to find yourself caring deeply for the lab members. I know I did and really, the second half truly hit home. Most of these things I'm saying is for the second half. The first half was like a rather dull foundation to the spectacular masterpiece that is Steins;Gate. 
Truly one of the best!",9
"
                Before I actually write out a review to this, I just want to briefly mention a bit about why this anime was particularly important to me. Putting it briefly, it was my first introduction to anime, although I wouldn't know it for a long time. When I was just a little kid, my dad did a lot of weird science stuff for fun. Among many of these things, where ionocrafts, or lifters, back when those were popular. He uploaded a few videos about it on youtube, one of which was used as the example video in the show! https://youtu.be/uF8otSSPgdA Interestingly, the video thumbnail was swapped
                  to another popular ionocraft video creator's thumbnail, but the video title and description survived. Comments pestered him and eventually he dug around and figured out it was connected to this show. I had no interest in anime at the time, but this was my first introduction to it. Just a fun aside! On to the actual review.
Story: 10
Good time travel is really hard to pull off. Hell, even good sci-fi is hard to pull off recently. But for what it's worth, Steins;Gate knocks it out of the park. If we are talking actual science, sure, we're way off course. But the enjoyability of the fake science is still great, it's kind of like listening to Star Trek technobable but in japanese. Other than the sci fi, the actual story is phenomenal, one of my favorites, maybe ever. It covers a lot of ground, sci-fi, horror, drama, romance, mystery, and everything in between with a little extra on top. Almost every episode kept me on the edge of my seat wanting more, something i‚Äôve almost never felt while binging a show before. Even after finishing, it still leaves some lingering questions, which I hope will be answered in season 2. I don't want to say too much, as every minute of the story is worth experiencing first hand.
Art: 9
Despite closing in on being a decade old, the art actually still holds up shockingly well. General animation and art quality is comparable to a lot of currently airing shows today. It was a small detail, but the really bright and washed out colors in outdoor scenes really gave me the impression of summer. Even if the cicada sounds wheren‚Äôt playing, you would have been able to tell immediately just by the color usage and exaggerated size of the sun. My only complaint is that there are a lot of scenes with characters just standing around and talking without much movement, but this ultimately didn't matter too much because it served the characters and plot well. 
Sound: 10
Music was something else I found the show did very well. The music never felt like it was encroaching on dialogue or other important sound effects, and set up scenes and tones extremely well. In some of the earlier episodes, the music really cranked up the horror aspects at some of their discoveries, and expertly built tension in other more suspenseful scenes. There really isn‚Äôt a lot to say here, they call it background music for a reason. It did its job, and it did it great.
Character: 9
Characters are certainly another strong suit of the anime. Almost all of the characters have very clearly defined arcs that are entertaining to watch. Seeing what people would do if they could change their past is interesting, but trying to get them to go back to how it was before things changed is even more interesting. This created really great arcs, especially Ruka‚Äôs in my opinion. The main characters also have some great development for the most part as well, but with one unfortunate exception in Daru. I just found his arc a little disappointing. While its conclusion was interesting because of what Daru *will* do, it left Daru without much development *right at that moment* in the story. But apart from that, S tier work for everyone else.
Enjoyment: 10
The pacing is great, always wanting me to keep going to the next episode without me ever feeling like there was too much or too little happening on the last one. It masterfully strings together the episodes into one cohesive story in a way that feels like you never miss a beat. It creates questions and gives you just enough to go on to have an idea, and then answers it, and sometimes you're right and sometimes you're wrong. There really was no aspect of the anime that felt lacking in any particular regard.
Overall: 10",10

                First time reviewer. Just a heads up.
This show‚Äôs got everything I look for & more. Finished episode 13 today & freaked ‚Äòcause I thought it was over‚Ä¶turns out there‚Äôs like 10 more episodes‚Ä¶It starts off kinda slow but does an instant 180 that‚Äôll leave you flabberflucked & wanting more. Though, that‚Äôs not to say that the episodes won‚Äôt keep you captivated. 
The art style could be better & the lack of bright pigments from the entire color spectrum might dissuade some die-hard shonen kiddy-kiddy viewers, but the shades of black, white, & grey correspond quite well with the story‚Äôs theme. & despite what you think
                  about the visuals, the characters will still wiggle their way into your heart. 
Okabe Rintarou, self-proclaimed mad scientist, is definitely one of my favorite anime protagonists of all time (I found myself rewinding each episode countless times just to hear him say a particular sentence over & over again). His charisma & downright looniness is contagious. Watching him interact with the rest of his ""lab members"" is enough to put a smile on one‚Äôs face.
Though the first few episodes might seem typical & downright confusing, what may seem like a typical happee-happee anime will definitely come to surprise you. This anime features a wonderful composition of both humor, suspense, & a dash of romance. Definitely worth the watch.

                An anime like no other, Steins;Gate is the best I have seen in a long time.
Story:
The story begins with the usual bunch of characters that we tend to file under the common tropes. The fan service girls, the hentai geek and the off beat main character. The first few episodes are nothing extraordinary. We follow the lab members as they go about their daily lives accepting Phone Microwaves as time machines as a matter of course. The show then kicks into gear and by the 10th episode I was hooked. It is paced like a detective story with slow introductions which familiarises us with the
                  characters and when the crime takes place, jots us out of our calm observational reverie and into a state where all the slight comments and actions of the characters in the past take on a new meaning.
The cohesion of the story is what impressed me the most, Going back and watching the first episode after the final one brought the story back in a full circle. All the dots connect.
Stories about people of different kinds coming together and forming a new makeshift family with strong bonds are some of the best kinds of stories and Steins;Gate is one of the best of its kind. The show has just the right amount of believable science and science fiction, humor (situational, ecchi and slapstick), love (hints of harem, between friends and the epic kind), revenge, action and a whole load of heart.
What is actually amazing is that this show points out so many of the common tropes and then turns it on its head.
Time travel? (Not a common theme, I agree) ALL your actions will have consequences.
Tsundere? Points it out and writes probably the most fleshed out female lead - ever - in anime.
Shounen-ai? Sex really doesn't make a difference.
Inter-dimentional travel? Love conquers all. No, really. (Not the fake kind. I'm looking at you Vision of Escaflowne.)
Harem? It's NOT obvious (or even important for the most part) who the lead will end up with.
Character:
Okabe Rintaro is the soul of the show. He is honest, brave and kind. His motivations are those we can get behind completely. He is just a guy wanting to do the right thing, to do what is best for his friends and he does them. He does them with such simplicity that I sometimes forgot how heroic his actions actually were.
His counterpart in a land populated by weak, large breasted and decorative females is Makise Kurisu - a genius theoretical physicist and neuroscientist - different. She is the perfect counterpart to Okabe and is believably the better half.
I am amazed that two of the best characters I have ever come across in recent times are from the same anime. The greatest thing about this couple, which I haven't seen in anime, is how real the relationship feels. The parts where she is there for him when he needs her - silently or vocally, him calling her by her name in a moment of clarity, her using his methods of being goofy to cheer him up feel so genuine and real. In the special episode when he says ""In any world lime, any time, any place, I love you"" is as swoon worthy and on par with any great declaration of love.
It feels like the whole show is an understatement of the great things in life - love, sacrifice, loyalty, curiosity, achievement and friendship.
Art:
Amazing. If you're like me and don't really notice the animation when you're watching, focusing more on the story, then this is one show where a second watch is definitely in order. Some scenes are like a sad, sweet song come alive. Hamasaki Hiroshi - the director has done a wonderful job. So much character in every frame.
Sound:
The opening track is ""hacking to the gate"" sung by Kanako Ito. It is a beautiful song which fits seamlessly with the tone of the story. The opening's visuals make complete sense by the end of the anime which like the end of the story itself, gives a nice sense of closure. The music used throughout the show is approprialtely pulse quickening and melancholy. The use and silence and cicadas is impressive.
Overall:
This is a must watch 10/10.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is one of those shows that takes its sweet time putting everything into place before crashing down sprinting to the finish line, and we can't help but be on the edge of our seats every step of the way. 
Story: 10/10
The prospect of time travel has always been a mystery. But when it's in the hands of a self referred ""mad scientist"", who knows what will happen. Such is fate for Okabe Rintaro, or as he wants to be called, Hououin Kyouma. When the idea of time travel is in the palm of his hand, all hell breaks loose. It only gets worse when
                  a shadow government agency comes knocking when they want the time travel concept for themselves.
Art: 9/10
The animation and art design are not exactly a spectacle for the eyes, but they're used in a way to get the desired emotion across. Frequent uses of bright light and pitch black darkness are used in times of confusion and suspense. While it's not flashy or stylized, the animation is one that can hold up on its own for many years to come. The depiction of real-life Akihabara in Japan is also a nice touch.
Sound: 8/10
The sound is probably the weakest point in the show, but it still makes good use of background noise and ambiance. The voice acting is stellar in both English and Japanese, and the opening theme is also good. The consistent buzzing of Okabe's phone and repetitive clicking of heels on the ground will be a nuisance.
Character: 10/10
Each character gets their moment in the spotlight throughout this series and is unique in their own interpretation. A single episode is usually granted to a character that revolves around the prospect of time and reality distortion. Some of the more interesting characters are reveal to have multiple duties and roles, fitting of this show's twisted nature.
Enjoyment: 10/10
This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest science fiction anime ever produced. It takes a while to get moving, but once it's rolling, it's nonstop suspense and thrills from start to finish. The characters are unique and have their own distinct personalities. The voice acting s superb and the music is astounding. This is truly a masterpiece for all to enjoy.",10

                Maybe rewatching an anime that you remember as being ""one of the best"" by the time you gain a bit of critical thinking is not a good idea.
The story is somehow decent but it's overshadowed by its extremely predictable characters. If you have Daru in this scene, he will tell some sexual joke, if you have Kurisu, she will scream, Mayushi will just exist and the list goes on for all of its first half. They're walking anime tropes that don't change very much by the end of the series.
I must say that this anime  tries to convince you it's deep, sad, deppresing and
                  all that when most of the time you have these kind of characters just making really bad decisions. A few chapters back you had them say time travel is dangerous so they should only go back for two weeks (and this was only a experiment) but then when a character suggests them to go back 10 years in time, they do it like nothing! there had to be at least some kind of development for them to do that! It's like they do it on purpose for drama to happen, so I can't take it seriously.
This anime could've been handled other way and it would be better, with more dimensional characters making actual mistakes and learning from them, but as it is, it isn't the good anime everyone seems to see.",4

                Steins;Gate is an anime in which the stars aligned, everything from its art, animation, sound track, writing and directing feel polished. You get an overall impression that this anime was professionally made in a proper studio with the quality of the production being the primary focus.. I say this not because Steins;gate did anything particularly revolutionary in any of these categories. At no point were any of the elements that go into an anime overbearing or attenuated, the project feels balanced in a way.  Everything is in sync. It felt like every member of the staff from a given key animator to the sound
                  department were on the same page, working together to keep the overall tone of the episode consistent. Animation lacked ambition but aside from that it was nearly perfect.
The success of Steins;Gate shows us that a great Anime can be accomplished without revolutionary animation or a big name director. All you need is teamwork, creativity and time in order to deliver a quality result.
Story:
I'll just condense what you already know.. this is a time travel anime about a college student and self proclaimed mad scientist who inadvertently constructs a form of time travel that allows him,to send a text message a brief distance into the past. As these cliches go, things get out of hand, leaving our handy main character to pick up the pieces.
Steins;Gate is very clever in its writing as it incorporates several different hurdles or challenges to overcome. Each step along the way is designed to project a slightly different premise. You could really bend your mind and convince yourself that SG has an overarching oremise aside from these, at face valie however theres not much there. The series delivers several lposely related ideas through its narrative, it does a good job. This should be sufficient enough.
Characters:
A great deal of characters, while lacking in development, were intriguing and unique. Our main was very 3-dimensional, however at times our support seemed a bit lacking in this regard. They were fun and vibrant and by no means difficult to watch. Their interactions were hilarious and voice acting on point in bith subbed and dubbed versions. They just lacked any degree of mystique. On a positive note; this may be one of the VERY few animes in which our supporting cast actually does what its designed to do and SUPPORTS the development of our main character, without quite the same degree of melodrama thats prevelant in this media.
Sound:
A very limited score, nothing spectacular here in terms of content. In this case its the use of the score that stands out. It sets establishes tone effectively; albeit repetitively.
Some clever use of sound to convey emotions without amy drawn out monologue, props for that.
Art/Animation:
Pale color palate and dutch angles come together to create an atmosphere that seems bleak and uncertain. Upon the resolution of the show the color returns, the angles correct themselves, representing the end of Okabes journey and his newfound sense of certainty in himself as a human being. Cinematically it was pretty decent.
Character designs were rather bland, the type of thing you'd expect to come of your typical ln/vn webani sweatshop. Some variations in character design from what you might expect; generally speaking these were anime characters. 
If we segregate Cinematography from Animation there was more done in terms of good ""camera work"" rather than good ""animation"" per se. We've seen this type of animation before. The artistic value is what sets Steins;Gate apart.
Enjoyment:
Many were turned off by the first half of the show, which I happened to love. There are many who attributed this to ""slow pacing"". These people are idiots. Steins;Gate had a thrilling first half.
The problem with the first half is that its a Sci-Fi MYSTERY type of story, with some suspense. If you don't like easy going ""whodunit"" kind of stories you won't enjoy the first half of SG. In this case honestly I would not recommend finishing the series. If you can't get sold on the first episodes din't torture yourself because someone promises you ""it gets good"".
 Unfortunately there are no disposable episodes in this one, the whole thing is plot relevant.",9

                About me
=================================
I've not watched any of the anime for a long time already, I didn't intended to do it though... But when I heard about the Steins;Gate (which is actually discussed among the Death Note, Code Geass, FMA B and others), I thought, ""3rd place on MAL? wait...?!"" So I started watching it... 
Review
=================================
From the begining of the series, frankly speaking, it was not more than [7 - 7.5] score either... I'm pretty much competente in fundamental physics and rated the Sci-Fi on low score too, coz some of the theories/events in anime are just nonsense.. but that doesnt really matter.
But from the key episode
                  12, it just got much better. More serious, more thriller, more exitement. From this very episode anime's score increased to [9].
Last 3 episodes were very good. Splendid ending. 
Overall
==================================
This anime obviously is one of the best. Very good work but still some episodes lack sense, detail and exitement (especially first 11). This anime could be far better with 17-18 episodes long.  
Story - splendid thriller.
Animation and art are not on their top but still very nice. 
Splendid sound effects and OST. 
Characters are well detailed. Their inner world and thoughts are contrasted very well.
Enjoyment can be rated to 9. MUST SEEN ANIME.
As for me, this anime can be rated to [9] score.",9

                Good pacing, above average banter in the dub. Stein's Gate is a fun time travel suspense thriller/comedy with worthy feels, but no masterpiece. Worth the watch. Go do that and skip this review which contains SPOILERS to maximize your enjoyment of Stein's Gate - going in blind probably matters more here than for other shows.
Enjoyment 9
The dub is excellent with lively banter between lead characters, and the bad guy is CERN. Seems like CERN got this role in the story based on the feeling of discomfort spread around by popular science articles that reported the LHC could create a small black hole that would devour
                  the world when it came online back before it did come online in 2008. CERN's perceived desire to just YOLO that shit ""for science"", a decision that was in fact based on the consensus among physicists that there would almost certainly *not* be a black hole created by the LHC, is dramaticized and coloured in here to make them the villains! Delicious. So of course as the mad scientists they must be to have done that, no surprise that CERN has been using these little black holes to send human test subjects back through time with disastrous gelatinous results. CERN has also created a surveillance program similar to the Five Eyes' data collection practices to monitor the world for viable time travel research so they can send their time goons after it!  Ahaha... classic.
It's really the ""wow, wonder what happens next"" feeling that makes the show so enjoyable. The main characters are for some reason virgins who place the same impact on kissing, hand holding, and hugs that a mature adult places on sex and marriage. Its just unecessary in an otherwise mature setting and weakens the show. I'm not a fan of gratuitous sex scenes that do nothing to develop the characters involved or advance the story, but SG manages to infantilize its characters by forgoing all opportunity for post-coital exposition and realistic romance. The opportunity was there, I mean we're talking about Groundhog Day meets The Butterfly Effect but with more death - you could have just had them fuck or build up to a more believable feeling of intimacy built up through harrowing though unremembered experiences, idiots. As it stands, the characters feel disposable rather than relatable because of their prudishness. Daru is the only one with a remotely interesting sexuality, which is hilarious because it revolves around maid cafes and an egirl harem! Christ. Easy win left on the table in a locked box.
Story 8
What's good about the story is that it's a bit of a whodunit but the ""it"" is time travel. Whacky twists and turns that draw characters into the plot as more than what they first presented themselves as are well executed and the pacing throughout the show is great. I wanted to see the next episode, and I appreciated the crises presented and overall structure of the plot despite the gaping holes.
On the other hand the plot is full of gimmicks, some retcons, the ending is faux clever and let down further by an uncharacteristic lapse in execution for those specific sequences in the final episode. To the creator's credit, SG takes a big bite and chews it better than most time travel stories. Dark comes to mind, which borrows a fair bit from Stein's Gate and isn't as good. That said if you've seen Primer, Groundhog Day, Terminator, The Butterfly Effect, Donnie Darko etc. then you're unlikely to have your mind blown - SG borrows heavily from the aforementioned and its not always the best match. Another aspect that sways between charming and disappointing is the ghetto ""lab"" consisting of one competent computer scientist, one noteable young physicist, and a young Don Quixote/Peter Pan who only founded the lab to help his friend get over the death of her grandmother. Somehow without the help of the physicist who joins later, these chumps MacGyver a time machine from a microwave, bannanas, a TV and some flip phones... okay, I accept. But when you start taking your own made up rules for the DIY time appliance seriously and give up the gaffe machine coveted by the evil CERN angle - you better make me appreciate that transition. Not so sure I did. Gender bending, city planning, life saving - all legit and hilarious uses of the time machine. But once CERN unleashes their time goons people's deaths become fated and the inalienable right of our protagonist to put another coin in the machine starts to chaffe. 
In the end, our misfit virgins get themselves off the hook far too easily by hitting Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-Z, getting on a video call with tech support, stab, stab, then rebooting into happily ever after. Its a bit much and a lot was left on the table. Then again, as I mentioned before what they did bite off was already a lot and Stein's Gate is more a slice-of-life than an intro to the imaginative alternative timelines it uses as plot devices. Could have squeezed endless seasons and spin-offs out of this material, which is probably why the story overall embitters me. I like to see a universe bake, not a flash in the grease trap.
Art 8
SG is quite pretty. Some of the motifs are impactful, like the broken clock and the frantic flip phone usage. Action is sparse but satisfying. Some of the best artwork is the retro technology and domestic objects. The characters feel vulnerable and plot armor isn't as glaring as it often is largely because of how the movements, injuries, and emotional responses of the characters are depicted. The work overall is smooth and fits the narrative and pacing quite well. Shading and lighting are used well, few frames seem out of place. A good job, not a standout though.
Sound 8
For the dub alone, 10/10. For the rest, it was good. The cicadas were a bit much, but the suspense was there and obviously sound can really make or break a thriller. In this case it made those moments. I don't often notice the sound on its own unless unbelievably good, unbelievably bad, or jarring for some other reason. Probably how it should be, and SG was very smooth in this department.
Character 8
Probably the weakest part of the show. It was damn close and only needed to nudge a few traits here and there to have itself a deep cast. Daru is the best character. He's a believable hobbyist engineer, brogrammer, and ""hacker"" who loves his that's what she said toilet humour, maid cafes, egirls and building shit that works. Not insecure at all, and just as porky as his interests suggest. Suzuha and the landlord are also good characters all things considered. The plot asks a lot of them, but even in alternate timelines where they do some crazy shit the strength of their dubbed characters is such that they pull it off without irking the audience. The tier list from there starts with our main protagonist who has some complexity going on behind the stupid mad scientist gag. Then, our tier list falls off a cliff into a trash bin where we find everyone else and their uninintersting backstories cobbled together from throwaway Anime characters past, present, and future.
Thankfully, the banter in the dub saves the characters and helps you forgive what you don't like. Also not the worst out there.",8
"
                okay so this show is worth watching. But of course to categorize it as science fiction is a little off, though in reality it really is, or at least it feels as it should be.What i mean by that is, the show starts off kind of boring and you really don't even get what the hell is going on until like the 8th episode. But i mean it is a good show, i enjoyed it, as well as the characters and it is actually surprisingly entertaining.  Just don't get caught up on things that don't make sense. Like for example, if you have ever
                  seen star trek:the next generation, you might wonder ""hey captain speaks with an english accent, yet he has a french name, and was born in france and even has a french family. So what the hell? did britain not exists? why didnt they just make him british?"" but if you forget that crap it's a good show.",9
"
                I totally fell in love with this anime. With the first few episodes Steins;Gate built up a world that totally sucks you in and the payoff in the later episodes is huge because of that. I personally like slow-paced anime especially if the slower pace makes sense and drags you more into the story. It doesn‚Äôt mean that Steins;Gate is an overall slow paced anime but at the beginning the show takes it time and I think it is good so. Rintarou is one of these protagonists that makes the show better and is comprehensible. The relationships between certain characters are dynamic and you can
                  see why they acted as they did. For me Steins;Gate is an absolute masterpiece that everybody should at least give a shot.",10
"
                Just wow... to steins;gate's ending. At first the anime started out confusing, since it started with someone's death.It got really slow afterwards. for example most of the episodes were about experiments and friend, but the anime picked up after awhile and from there on the anime became great. i got hooked by the storyline completely. 
Characters:
Some of the characters are annoying, but they aren't terrible. The voice acting was great for the characters. It was especially great for Okabe.
Enjoyment:
I enjoyed the anime very much. It was great at the beginning and end but the middle part is a bit slow and repetitive. Overall i love
                  the series though.",9
"
                I've seen a lot of shows I'm new on the site, that's why I don't have a big list, but don't let that mislead you.
 Steins gate is one of the best show (if not the best) ive ever watched and hands down the best time travel history, its start off slowly building up the characters, one of the most important things on the show so you can relate to them and building up its time travel concept that as a a physics lover stays true to it, 99% of the things or scientific concepts mentioned are true and not just some random pseudoscience bullshit
1=
                  The characters are amazing everyone of them has its own personality  and feel alive, you can care and relate to them, especially Okabe our protagonist 
2=The plot is masterfully written and planed from beginning to end most of the supposed plot holes can be explained perfectly so don't listen to anyone who say that 
3= Its like a roller coaster of emotions it will make you laugh it will get you on suspense it could make you cry or feel emotional thanks to the awesome characters 
TL; DR Edition: It's one of the best (if not the best) shows ever not just anime I'm counting books, tv and movies its masterfully written has amazing characters with an awesome plot and concept with this series time travel (and maybe Sci fi in general) has been topped.
PD: Sorry for my English its not my native language",10

                *This review might contain some minor spoilers*
Unlike a lot of people, this anime did not win me over in the first episode or third, so I went really slow with this anime till it actually started captured every bit of my attention, I had to work my brain while watching it, analysing the scenes that was occuring, connecting the dots in the plot, it was tricky, it was so much, so much in the good way, how you actually get into it, it's getting sucked into a black hole, at least you manage to get out of this one but with your feelings all f*cked.
                  / Worth it /
Oh, the satisfaction when everything start making sense, it is honestly one of the best storylines that I've seen. 
The characters developments, the hardships many of them face, the regrets, the sacrifices, the guilt and happiness. Losing a parent, searching for one, losing your identity, searching for it, losing a friend, saving a friend. It's a masterpiece. It was built so thoroughly, the way this was introduced... It made me believe of an actual possibility of such thing to have an actual existence, however, I am certain correcting the mistakes that would occur when you travel back in time wouldn't be remotely simple, if anything, possible.  
Either way, I enjoyed this in every aspect, the happy moments, sad ones, it was all worth the watch. 
Try it yourself!",10
"
                Steins;Gate is one of the most unique anime out there, whether that be for its story, its characters, or its atmosphere. This is why it's so popular, but I do think it's overrated.
STORY :
First of all, Steins;Gate is a part of Science Adventure, a crossover between several series (like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you know). The other series are Chaos;Head, Robotics;Notes, and their sequels.
But as neat as it sounds, these series have almost nothing in common. Most of the links are barely references, and the main stories almost never tie together. As a crossover series, it's a fail.
Steins;Gate is part of this fail as well.
                  Just like the others, it's too ""individual"", and that's just wrong in a crossover series.
Aside from that, let's talk about the story itself. A ""mad scientist"" runs a science club, and accidentally creates a machine to send a mail back in time. The story is about their life as they study their revolutonary system, and use the ""D-mails"" (mails sent back in time) to change things in their past.
Then, mandatory butterfly effect : they did change the past, but it has uncontrollable consequences on their lives. What started as a fun adventure then takes a tragic path, as the SERN (a big scientific organization) learns of the little club's Time Machine and decides to shut them up.
This plot is just amazing. At first, you can think it's dumb that they manage to create a Time Machine by accident ; but actually, it's not as unlikely as you think. Many things are discovered by accident, even in science.
And this is what's great about Science Adventure : as a science-fiction, it gets ahold of true science perfectly and use it to make an interesting story.
There is also a lot of references to true Time theories and other Time-related stuff : from Kerr Black Holes to John Titor, there's a lot of references to real world, which makes Steins;Gate quite realistic.
Art :
There, sorry, but we can't give a good mark. Steins;Gate was released in 2011, but it feels like it's from the early 2000's. Dull color with wrong saturation, weird eyes (even in anime standards), average environment, no outstanding lighting effects...
Sound :
Here, it's a little better. The opening is great, and some tracks of the OST are memorable. It's nothing outstanding though...
Characters :
√îkabe Rintarou is awesome. First, he acts a a parano√Ød ""mad scientist"", but he gets more and more serious as he realizes that what was just a game becomes much more. His seiyuu makes an incredible job here, although his ""mad scientist"" is a bit too much over-the-top (I mean, that's voluntary, but I did find it annoying sometimes).
For the rest, there is nothing outstanding. Most of the side characters are flat and not important to the main story, yet the show spends a lot of time on them ; that's wasted time.
Then, there is this romance between the two mains, √îkabe and Chris. That romance was one too many. The show is about making a Time Machine in ""real life"", there is no need for love here. But the real problem is, I don't find it very believable. More like, unbelievable at all. I don't see how each can fall in love with the other, especially since they don't spend that much ""real time"" together because of Time Travel mismatch.
Enjoyment :
Despite the mediocre visuals and the side characters, Steins;Gate is still really enjoyable. The story is great and although it is slow, it does move forward. The major strong point is how realistic it feels. That's why there is comedy AND tragedy : in real life, there is always a bit of both.
And that's why this sort of show will always be more accurate than pure horror shows or pure comedic shows : life is neither of them.
Overall :
As a conclusion, Steins;Gate is really not ""the best anime ever"", not even ""one of the best"" in my opinion. But it's fairly good, especially for its main character, for its atmosphere, and for its main story.
For the rest, it spends too much time on useless side characters, and feels quite old for a 2011 anime.
As of today though, Steins;Gate 0 has been released, and for now it has none of the flaws that the previous anime had.",7
"
                The concept was tier S and if the pacing just continued that way then everything would have been fine BUT THEY DIDN'T.
It was fine until the romance shows up. It's not that the romance genre ruin it BUT the writer does not seem to be that experience making good romance stories or kept on sending weird signals. I understand if they want the end goal to be that couple especially with how many times the guy went on different timeline but this was not executed perfectly. We are left to question why did he then decided to go all out to find a way to
                  save his friend? Just cause of friend? By then would it not be better to instead make the guy accept his friend's fate and smooch on his girl? Instead we got the ""I'm willing to sacrifice (not really) my love just for my friend which I feel more like an obligation than just because I want to be with them forever"".
It just sends a lot of weird signals. I am confused why people call this a masterpiece when the ending failed it. My brother said the other seasons save the ending interpretation but it's really hard for me to agree with that when we see that many people's happiness were sacrifice for this dude and apparently it's all dandy and fine since he's the main character or something.",3
"
                First off, i would like to say that this is one of the best anime ever, if not already proven by the ratings it has gotten. This anime causes people to think over the story and even make some people pause the video and think: what the hell did he just say and what did he mean by that? But that's how i an anime so if you don't want to use your brains on an anime, i would not recommend this.
story-10/10
I give this a high rating because it just has a really good flow to it and it doesn't make people just want to
                  ""watch"" it, it makes people go along with it and feed them happiness along the way.
art-8/10
Personally, i don't really care about the art that much cuz everyone has their own style.
sound-9/10
The sound was pretty good, especially when it needed the effects to make the anime more sci-fi like.
character-10/10
nailed it. nailed it. The characters have their own story to each and everyone of them. The main characters all had their own ""thing"" they did to contribute to the story. They were all complex and were the type of people you really needed for a geek squad, it fits perfectly in this anime.
enjoyment-9/10
this was a really intense anime and it really had me on the edge of my seat, it also had the times were it made people feel good when it needed to. It was really nice and all, but the reason i gave it a 9 was because sometimes the explaining parts were way too long and you get kind of a feeling where its just like: ummm, ok. thats cool but what the hell does that mean? then you have to pause the anime and think about what just happened.
overall-10/10
i just liked anime. I was pretty impressed on how the author executed the ending. I just like it. thats all. it was really good.",10
"
                TL;DR :  Have you watched it yet? and again? and again?
 *THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN UNINTENTIONAL SPOILERS, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK*
Steins;Gate is something that I would personally rate as higher than outstanding. The feeling you get when you watch your favourite show as a kid on the TV when you haven't seen it in years. It feels like you belong here, all the emotions flowing into you. Happiness, Sadness, Pain, Cheer. The times of when you would sit outside and think that, life was worth living just to witness that. Well, a show like this only comes to be after many years, nothing
                  truly spectacular ever shines beyond what is the norm. But Steins;Gate, that is something I would say definitely belongs there.
Steins;Gate will forever be in my books of anime to re-watch. When I'm older I will marvel at what I watched back in the day and think, how the hell did i understand any of this???
Well, time to crack down on the details
STORY: 10/10
I would say this is personally my favourite story I've ever seen read or played. The way it starts is slow, this may even bore you, but if you stick with it you realise that all of this was necessary to build up an explosion of intense drama.
The time travel, being the main plot device, was greatly executed. The wide range of theories and science covered in such a short time is amazing. Things like the butterfly effect, a really well known part of time travel is explored thoroughly and the way this effects Okabe psychologically is clearly represented in the show.
You will not expect such a massive increase in tension and suspense in the latter episode which leave you clinging to your seats making you beg for more until ultimately giving you a forever unquenched thirst for something that can rival this spectacular show.
ART: 7/10
The art dies its job. It gives off the correct amount of colour and detail for the situation but not much more. The was too little emphasis on what made the characters in the visual novel amazing. Despite this you can tell they worked hard with what they had and the colour scheme was spot on for the majority of the show. There isn't much else to say, it was standard art used in a show that had a lot of potential.
SOUND: 8/10
The OP in this anime is well suited for the show, it is the right amount of intensity for the beginning and the end. However, the 8 is for the background music, or to be precise, the lack of it. The music was quite plain and yes did successfully set the atmosphere, but didn't show the pure amazing-ness of the peaceful scenes. As for the voice actors and actresses I think they did a wonderful job of portraying the characters. i watched this in both dub and sub and they are both spectacularly presented. Good job to the VA's.
CHARACTERS: 10/10
This is what Steins;Gate got perfect.
The correct blend of different stereotypes with their own unique twist allow for interesting conversations that do not get even get a little bit boring. The main character being a person with chuunibyou or the female lead being a girl who's a meme addict who hides it with a tsundere personality.
The way the characters mature over time varies with the character.
In my opinion the anime shows the 3 different types of maturing.
1. Okabe
Okabe is the main character and therefore receives the most attention when it comes to building his character. You see him start off as a delusional man who is socially awkward and cannot comprehend what others think of him. But as the anime progresses you get to see many different sides to this character and events that happen lead to the direct changes in his personality to the point of where he throws away his 'fun' side nearly completely. We witness him change throughout and see the entirety of what he has to go through.
2. Kurisu
Kurisu is the main female lead of this show and therefore also receives a lot of attention. The building of her character is due to her witnessing the growing of someone else's character and her evolving to help that person (if you couldn't tell it's Okabe). She gets told by Okabe exactly what he's going through and you get to see her slowly start to become friends with him later on. This changes her character and allows for Okabe to have someone to lean on when the worlds against him.
3. Mayuri
This girl has a habit of making Okabe sad in the later episodes (You will know what I mean if you watch it). She just happens to be a good childhood friend of Okabe and they get along just fine. Except something happens again and again which Okabe doesn't like, but due to Mayuri not having any memory of it her character doesn't grow, but instead aids Okabe's growth as a character. Mayuri plays the innocent girl which the MC has to save, with her ""tuturu""'s as well.
ENJOYMENT: 10/10
This show is enjoyable. There's all types of emotions I felt watching this, all coming together to brew into one ball of greatness that exceeds any other show by far. The way Steins;Gate toys with your feelings like they're worthless makes you welcome the show with your heart and in turn it will ruin it with depression so hard that you will never recover until Steins;Gate 0 is released. O have already re-watched this 4 times and this made me buy the manga and the game. This only reinforces that people should watch this show.
OVERALL: 10/10
I think you can tell I enjoyed this show. The show is worthy off the title 'masterpiece' that everyone seems to be throwing around a lot and that alone makes it worth while. If there is an anime you haven't watched yet, this takes priority.
This show has flaws of course. However, if you look at it from the right perspective, you can see past them flaws and embrace it for what it is.",10

                Having been burned badly by _Chaos;head_, I was initially going to give _Steins;gate_ a pass, but it finished to apparent acclaim and I started to get worried about spoilers, so I dove in; the first episode looks good and promising - but then, so did _Chaos;head_. With an interesting apparent setup of time travel, I found the start of _Steins;gate_ to be bizarrely slow; I think they my've spent 4 entire episodes futzing around their lab with hardly anything to show for it. I was wondering in the first 3 episodes how they were going to fill up all 24 episodes since things seemed to
                  be developing so fast, but I guess they've answered my question... (Also, cellphones make for bad anime, don't they? It was true in _Durarara!_ and is still true in _Steins;gate_. Film people need to figure out clever tricks like _Sherlock_'s screen overlays or otherwise we'll be condemned to a future where either we're staring at people staring at their cellphones or contemporary settings are blatantly unrealistic with few cellphones.)
Fortunately, my prayers were answered and after a few more episodes, shit finally got real. I was interested in the 'iterate butterfly effect' style (although I was annoyed at Okabe not being smart enough to immediately ask what changed, and just freaking out instead). That got dropped fairly quickly for the kill-Mayuri arc (which seemed both implausible and something I've seen before too many times, the futile time loop, in _Higurashi_ & _Haruhi_), but just as I was getting disgusted with Okabe, they finally brought out part-time warrior (and why didn't Okabe talk to her the very first time he time-leaped?!) who as I thought was both from the future and also Daru's daughter (though they failed to notice that Daru *was* going to the meetup with John Titor in the other worldlines), in an awesomely harrowing plot arc that made up for it all. I truly did not expect her to fail.
And then, just as before, _Steins;gate_ made up for some dull episodes with some excellent twists; episode 20 in particular impressed me with how it dealt with Moeka and Braun.
Then we finish with a roller-coaster of an ending. Really awesome epiphany/parting for Okabe & Kurisu, followed by pathetic giving up with Okabe all 'oh I can't possibly change Kurisu's fate' (lolwut?) and then the pathetic twist that Okabe kills Kurisu (-_-), followed by a good final operation/ending. All in all, very satisfying and better than _Haruhi_ or _Higurashi_ as far as the timeloops go. _S;g_ deserves its praises.",9

                 It's a great anime a science-fiction plus funny , i think everyone should give it a try ... most what i loved about this this show it shows us even we can time-travel , go to past and fix the pasts mistakes but it will change the present so dramatically that there is no guaranty we will like the change ... so it's better to live a happy life with what we have in the present time ... Because no meter what life goes on and in life there is sacrifice and pain but to be happy we must endure those .... it's fun
                  to watch this anime with few weird and lovable character and with a slide of romance .... the character development was really cool ... to avoid spoilers i tried to enter the main story there but i hope you guys gonna love it",9

                This is such a beautiful show. I‚Äôve never met anyone who didn‚Äôt like it and revered it as a classic minimum 9/10 show. The first season is just the best take on a slice of life with way more depth. It‚Äôs funny, relatable, thrilling, and romantic. If you‚Äôre even thinking about watching it, definitely don‚Äôt hesitate. Don‚Äôt worry if you see a bad review of this, it‚Äôs probably someone trying to purposely lower the rank because their fAvOriTe show isn‚Äôt ranked high enough or someone who is cynical on romance (from a broad spectrum) or couldn‚Äôt appreciate the funny nuances. This isn‚Äôt even my favorite
                  show, it was just that good.",10

                I don't recommend you see my review coz its fully biased ........
steins gate is story of some bunch 15 to 20 year old kids with a time machine .......protag okabe made a microwave that turned out be something interesting
story was clearly something that you wont expect in the first 10 episodes .....for me I liked the whole,some people may say the first 10 ep will feel boring but if you like the vibes of the early 20s and a visuals which will make you feel you returned to that windows xp time
sound is pretty good .......the ending is the best one 
character and art both
                  are subjective 
(this may be the worst review you read)",10
"
                Ranked: #3
This is not a false ranking, or if it is false, it is that it should be #1.
This anime has everything you need in an anime and some things you didn't think animes needed (or wanted at all): Mad scientists with Dr. Pepper obsessions, microwaves that send texts to the past (all the ramifications of such) and one of the best female protagonists the internets will ever see, Kurisu Makise (CHRISTINAAAAA!).
Wacky, refreshing, genuinely amusing (not reliant on old gags or too many points at breasts) and most surprisingly moving.
When I started watching Steins;Gate for whatever reason I didn't immediately take to it, not to
                  say I disliked it, but I wasn't in love or amazed, 2 or 3 episodes later and I was in and couldn't believe I was ever out. It ropes you in (all be it maybe not straight away) and you laugh with the characters and start to see how everything works out and by the end you'd really connected with them. I think sometimes the most moving things come in unexpected places, I've watched many 'drama' anime's (tv series, movies and read dramatic books for that matter) and have been moved, but never to tears... but Steins;Gate got to me. I didn't expect it, but drama in a comedy can sometimes hit you the hardest (like the last episode of Blackadder IV, all be it that is moving in a different manner, and if anything Steins;Gate is the more moving of the two).
So get comfy, get it ready and then get watching and enjoy! I envy you for being able to watch it for the first time as it's honestly the best anime I've ever seen/probably ever will.

                I quite like the plot despite some cliche, plot holes and predictable parts. However, I think the characters let the plot down. Minor characters not really developed, generic, one-dimensional and unrealistic MCs for an anime like this.I was never really hooked even after the 12th episode that everyone was talking about since I was not emotionally attached to any characters. As a science person I was interested in how parallel universes were explained, but they just throw out false scientific terms and information and expect the viewer to just accept and go with the 'explanation' given. Not a masterpiece like other people would say -
                  it's for people that try to be deep.",6

                tl;dr Read the visual novel instead
This review is my attempt at providing a different perspective to the overly positive and negative reviews, and to explain exactly why Steins;Gate has caused such divisive reactions on MAL (and the internet at large). 
Throughout the review I'll be using the term 'VN' to refer to the Steins;Gate visual novel. For those unaware, Steins;Gate was originally released as a visual novel in 2009, but wasn‚Äôt translated into English until 2014 (well after the anime originally aired). I‚Äôm well aware that attempting to adapt a 25+ hour long Visual Novel with 6 endings into a 24-episode anime is obviously going
                  to result in content being cut. So, a good amount of my complaints would have resulted in a significant impact on the running time if they were remedied. 
Sadly, this is a result of the problem with Japan‚Äôs seasonal tv schedule. If an anime adaption only gets one season it has to fit a long story into a maximum of 26 episodes, each only 21-22 minutes long (not counting the opening and closing songs). That being said, some complaints I have would have had no or minimal time impact if they were resolved. I did try to look at the anime as its own ‚Äòthing‚Äô and avoided trying to directly compare it with the VN at every scene. The problem is that even if the VN did not exist many of my criticisms would still remain, but most issues exist as a result of changes when the story made from the journey from text to screen. As a consequence, I‚Äôll be referring to the VN throughout to help support my arguments.
Time Travel
At the beginning of Steins;Gate, there‚Äôs a scene where Kurisu is giving a talk on time travel at Okabe‚Äôs university. Her and Okabe briefly debate, and Kurisu gives a 20-minute-long lecture on the various theories on time travel to serve as an introduction of the concept to the viewer. She goes through each one giving the audie- Oh, wait, that scene was cut from the anime. Instead we get a 30 second scene where Kurisu supposedly embarrasses Okabe with her knowledge of time travel which ends with her admonishing him, and Okabe is shown dejected.
I understand the viewer complaints that the way time travel is presented in the anime feels both overly simple and convoluted at the same time; and the reason for that is because scenes like the above have been completely removed from the anime. In the VN we have many scenes of round table discussions between the characters and Okabe's inner thoughts to guide us through the time travel concepts, consequences of it and so on. The anime spends less than 10 minutes total (that‚Äôs NOT a typo) on the actual theory in comparison. 
Honestly, even with my pre-existing knowledge I became confused trying to follow along as there's such a shoddy job done of explaining the time travel aspect during the course of the show. I think fans are too willing to excuse the pretty blatant shortcomings, and (being a bit presumptuous here) I think its because the show does a good job of making the viewer 'feel' smart. I think the directors of the anime either didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äòbore‚Äô the viewers or realised that they didn‚Äôt have adequate time to discuss the concepts in any great detail, so their solution was to only include a few brief scenes explaining it and then to move on quickly as possible so that the viewer can‚Äôt stop and think about how little it all makes sense.
The authors of the VN made a huge amount of effort to make it as plausible and clear to the reader as possible, and it shows. It captures your imagination and makes you think about the long-term impacts of the characters decisions, the alternate worlds theories and so on. The only scene in the anime that I thought that made a decent effort was Suzuhzas talk with Okabe and Kurisu in episode 14, and even that was very brief. Describing it as ‚Äòbutchered‚Äô is putting it mildly. The VN is like reading a good Hard science fiction novel, while the anime is like watching a half-baked Hollywood sci-fi blockbuster.
Characters
A common complaint even among the bigger fans of the show is that some of the characters feel two dimensional, even stereotypical. In the entire run time of the anime, I thought only Okabe, Kurisu and Suzuha received a decent amount of character development. Simply put, most of the characters only show up when they‚Äôre needed to move the plot forward and aren‚Äôt given enough time to expand on their background, personalities and so on. As an example, this is why it feels a bit odd when Ruka and Faris suddenly express romantic interest in Okabe despite barely showing up in the previous episodes or interacting with him one on one directly. The reason? Their character arcs and daily conversations with him and the rest of the Lab team have been excised. I‚Äôm not going to claim that the characters from the VN are on the level of a Dostoyevsky novel, but they are believable as characters with their own thoughts, fears and failings. In the anime, the characters feel thin because THEY ARE thin.
Thinking about it, barely any of the characters in Okabe‚Äôs circle are even properly introduced to us. Here‚Äôs an example: right at the beginning of the VN Okabe tells us who Mayuri and Daru are, the nature of their relationship, how long he‚Äôs known them for etc. In the anime, I mean they‚Äôre just there in his life and it felt as though I was expected to already know who they were supposed to be. In the first episode Okabe says he‚Äôs known Mayuri ‚ÄòSince they were kids‚Äô and Daru is his ‚ÄòSuper Haker‚Äô, that‚Äôs it? Could they not spend even 30 seconds properly explaining who they are to us? 
I also want to address another common complaint, and that is that characters, Okabe in particular, seem to make irrational or hasty decisions. The VN is in a first-person view, so that you see everything from Okabe‚Äôs perspective. I cannot emphasise how important this is to the story, because you feel all of the things he feels. When he is deep in thought about a problem, or going through a personal crisis it endears you to him and helps you understand his perspective. So, when he makes a decision that seems irrational it is expressed clearly in the VN why he is making that decision, and it is usually after a discussion with the other characters (again, a discussion most likely not present in the anime). How does the saying go, ‚ÄòWe judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions‚Äô? Why didn‚Äôt the anime show more of his point of view? Its been a long time since I‚Äôve seen Death Note but a lot of that show took place in the characters heads with their thoughts spoken out loud to us, hell I think that was one of the main reasons it was so successful. Is there a reason anime is adverse from doing this more often? 
Before I move on to the next section, I want to give a concrete example of the problems the anime has in regards to character actions. There‚Äôs plenty for me to choose from but I‚Äôm going to bring up one scene in particular that really bothered me. In episode 23, we are re-introduced to Suzuha and she tells Okabe about WW3 and the need to re-write the past. How do you think he should react to this shocking revelation? Maybe by asking some questions about: How did World War 3 start? How is almost the entire population of earth wiped out? Is SERN responsible for it? Why is Suzuha wearing military fatigues? How about, you know, just expressing some joy that Suhuza is back alive in the flesh? 
Well, he does none of these things. In fact, he barely even offers any resistance when Suzuha tells him that she needs his help and he also doesn‚Äôt ask for more information like he clearly should. In the VN, he acts as you would expect anyone in his position would by collapsing at the absurdity of the situation and refusing flat out to help Suzuha due to the trauma he‚Äôs faced. It takes a lot of coaxing to get him to agree to come along which is done in part by answering the many questions he (and us) have about the situation.
Pacing
The next thing I want to bring up is the pacing. Episode 1-12 are often described as being ‚Äòslow‚Äô, and a common view is that not a lot happens in these episodes. But, the consensus is that they are necessary, especially as the stakes are raised in the next half of the show. My thoughts? I‚Äôm going to make a crazy claim here, one that is probably going to confuse most folks and say that the pacing is‚Ä¶ too fast. Episodes 1 to 12 (around 4 hours) are covered in chapters 1 to 5 of the Visual Novel, and even if you read at a pretty brisk pace it‚Äôll most likely take you more than 12 hours to read those chapters. Why is it that people can make it through this part of the visual novel without too many problems yet I‚Äôve heard a lot of people complain that they dropped the show after a few episodes?
Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou is an example of a slow-paced anime, this isn‚Äôt. Steins;Gate problem is not that the pacing is slow, its problem is that there is no ‚Äòhook‚Äô for the viewers established in the early episodes to make them continue watching. Yes, we have the time machine and we can send messages back to the past but the show does not successfully garner viewer interest because they haven‚Äôt brought any mystery into the equation. The VN makes the implications of the time machine more interesting, and also brings in intrigue as we wonder about SERN and the other characters impact in the story. Hell, SERN is barely even mentioned in the early episodes of the anime. Even the interactions (again, almost all removed from the anime) that you have with the other characters were entertaining enough on their own to make me continue reading the VN.
In reality, the anime moves at a quick pace. If you re-watch and go on a scene by scene basis a lot of ground is covered by the anime in each episode. Too much in my opinion, there‚Äôs not enough breathing space. This is a problem I also had with Violet Evergarden, another anime commonly described as ‚Äòslow‚Äô. This is something that‚Äôs actually quite tough for me to argue in a manner I‚Äôm happy with, but here‚Äôs one example to give you an idea of what I‚Äôm talking about. When the time leap machine is created, it done as an afterthought. Kurisu seemingly invents this ground-breaking piece of technology in less than one episode (barely one morning?) while in the VN it is shown as a difficult several days long effort by all involved. Its importance is not given enough emphasis. Keeping the story moving is fine, but the show went from A->B here far too quickly, it does that a lot in fact. 
There are another series of issues I want to bring up that I‚Äôve not seen many others talk about, all of which significantly hindered my enjoyment of the show:
SERN
SERN is presented as an actual threat in the VN. They are part of a wider conspiracy involving the Committee of 300, an ever-present group of shadowy figures who appear in the other Science Adventure games. The committee of 300 and their relationship with SERN is completely removed in the anime. In the brief moments the anime talks about SERN it presented as an, honestly really generic evil organisation. The ‚Äòdystopia‚Äô SERN is responsible for is presented in such a boring manner too, I mean it sounds like your average dystopia present in a mediocre action film. Where‚Äôs the sense of danger? The VN did such a great job of building a picture in your mind about how disturbing the society of the future will be if SERN succeed. I actually think this lessened the impact that Suzuha‚Äôs letter had in episode 16. Because we know how important her mission is in the VN, we understand how distraught she must be at not accomplishing it while I didn‚Äôt care nearly as much while watching the anime.
Tone
The VN is hardly adult in comparison to most visual novels out there, but it touched on some disturbing themes, showed some dark character moments and had a fair amount of bad language. I don‚Äôt think something needs swearing to make it good, but it was impactful when the scene needed it. The anime, simply put, is sanitized. Here‚Äôs just one example of a change for the worse: In the VN, when Okabe goes to Moeka‚Äôs apartment to get information on her d-mail Kurisu tells Okabe to kill her if he needs to‚Ä¶ and he tries to! It shows you how desperate the characters are to succeed and given all the events leading up to this moment it makes sense too. In comparison, Okabe has to muster the courage just to throw a single punch at Moeka in the anime.
I wouldn‚Äôt call the atmosphere in the anime ‚Äòhappy‚Äô, but it was just so different to the VN. I‚Äôm not saying the VN wasn‚Äôt filled with humour or softer moments but when it was serious it FELT serious. The anime does not capture the despair, melancholy and pain present in the darker sections of the VN. I thought episodes 16 and 21 came somewhat close to the atmosphere of the VN, that was about it.
Art
I‚Äôm not going to claim that the original VN is an artistic masterpiece but it has a distinctive style; if you send me a screenshot from the VN from any scene I‚Äôll immediately know ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs from Steins;Gate‚Äô. Its expressive, using a bright mix of colours and shading.  The art in the anime on the other hand is a bit dull and lifeless. It looks like any other show out there, there's nothing to set it apart. The style of the characters has been subtly changed too, and I feel as though part of the overall personality and charm of the them and the world of Steins;Gate itself has been stripped.
Music
The music is one of the few things I enjoyed from the anime adaptation. It was done by Takeshi Abo, who also composed the music for the VN and the other Science Adventure games. This was the first anime project he worked on, and I‚Äôm not sure if it was due to a tight schedule or not but a good half of the soundtrack is taken from the VN and the actual OST is rather short. In terms of the anime soundtrack, some tracks are general ambient tracks to build the mood but there‚Äôs some memorable themes at the more emotional points which suit the anime well. If you‚Äôre not familiar with Abo‚Äôs other work, two old-school ones I can recommend are ‚ÄòRhyme Star‚Äô and ‚ÄòMarionette Mind‚Äô.
I want to explain why I'm being so harsh with the low score. This is a straight adaptation, meaning that it adapted the full plot of the source material without making significant changes to the story, characters etc. But, as I've explained above they've only put in the 'highlights' and ignored everything else. Everything about it is just so watered-down. I can't think of a single reason why you'd watch this versus playing through the visual novel, other than a lack of time. The VN is just so much better in every department.  If Steins;Gate was an anime original, I'd probably give it a 7/10 but as it isn't I'm going with a 4.
I actually had a lot more to talk about but I think the above just about summarises my main complaints with Steins;Gate. Hopefully I‚Äôve changed some minds on MAL as I wanted to provide an extensive counter argument to the overwhelmingly positive reception it has. I‚Äôd strongly recommend folks buy the game from Steam, and install the fantastic improvement patch from the Committee of Zero. El Psy Kongroo",4

Story:10
To start things off i should say that the first episode is not catchy that much.I indeed watched the first episode and found it boring then dropped it long ago.What a mistake that was.About a year ago i gave a shot to it again and almost watched it in 3 days.Now the point is it is a show that begins to tell the actual storyline that catches you after some episodes.But first episodes are not bad just not as catchy as the following episodes.Actually they play a big role with introducing characters that you will care and sympathsize.Now little complains aside the story begins with Okabe Rintarou aka Hououin Kyouma and his friends from lab(basically his home) finding a way to customize a microwawe into a device which can send a message to the past and what would happen if you use it selfishly.Time travelling concept is not a new thing to the industry but the way steins gate uses it separates other from steins gate.I think the biggest reason why time travelling is so associated with steins gate is character designs.Designs are so well written that characters and their decision make you feel all emotions throughout the season.Sometimes you feel like crying,sometimes it makes you so happy that you find yourself smiling looking at the screen,sometimes you feel like you are making the hard decisions that eventually all characters have to face and wondering what the consequence
will be.Like this the story and characters are intertwined so well that make you curious about next episode.
Art:8
It's not perfect and it's not bad just somewhere in the middle.Indeed the point of the show was never action scenes so i don't think that it's that much necessary.I think they did a great job with showing the feelings of characters.
Sound:10
Literally one of my favoruite parts of steins gate.They used soundtracks so well in every scene you hear them that it makes the scene more powerful,more hearthbreaking and more beatiful.I can't stop myself from getting goosebumps when i listen to them and recalling how beatiful that scenes were with these soundtracks.In my opinion soundtracks are one of the core parts of cruel and powerful scenes in steins gate.Besides soundtracks voice actings is perfect either.Charachers really can show you how they feel inside with perfect voice acting.Overall sound in steins gate is perfectly used and what makes scenes more memorable.
Character:10
Charaters are what makes steins gate so perfect and interesting.Throughout the season you will sympathize and understand everyone of them.You'll feel sad when they face a hard decision which eventually happens to all of them as i mentioned,you'll feel as empty as them when they lose their will to live,you'll feel excited like a little child when a new operation starts,and this goes like that.All of them have unique personalities and they feel like a really good friend of yours.So overally designs are perfect and they feel like living people,show makes you think like if time travel was real the decisions they make would totally make sense.
Enjoyment:10
After first episodes when the real and serious storyline starts it just doesn't stop at all.Every episode you watch only makes you more hungry for the next one.It makes you cry and laugh.Every episode is a new adventure of characters that you love and care.From start to end never ending emotional voyage.
Overall:10
Steins gate is and will be a special show for me for a long time.It affected me a lot.Art is the field where it lacks the most but other perfect things that this show does makes me ignore it.This is a show which i can recommend everyone no matter what they like.Steins gate is a cult Sci-fi which everyone at least needs to give it a shot in my opinion.Literally i have no grief about decisions they make and overall the storyline.It just feels original and makes you want more of it.Overall a masterpiece.",10

                The whole bundle of Steins;Gate is a masterpiece. That includes the story as it's unique, music is fantastic and even the English voice acting is great. The opening theme song is amazing as well, there is no reason to skip this intro.
I am not really a massive fan of anime or obsessed with it or whatever but Steins;Gate was actually really good and I loved the characters.
If you finished this series then don't forget about Steins;Gate 0 which is basically the sequel. Intro from the first season is better though.
I'm just patiently waiting for a season three :)

                I found it to be very good considering it's an anime on time travel you can't expect much but a twisted plot. 
1. It's a bit slow paced in the beginning but picks up speed as the story progresses halfway along. Then on keeps you on the edge until the end.
2. Like any other time travelers hazards, it tells a tale on how changing a part of the past affects the present and the future events. 
3. As per character review, there seems to be loopholes, being a 24 episode series I expected to know more about certain characters. Not disappointed as each had a
                  good end to it.
4. It has comedy, somewhat light romance with ecchi lines and scenes here and there which helps to keep up with the humor. Not the thriller type I expected but yes, full on sci-fi. 
Watch it! you wont regret! :P",8

                I couldn't even finish; I got to episode 8 and literally could not physically go on. I am probably going to finish this anime some time in the future because of how loved it is, but for now, I honestly can't put myself through this boring plot and frustrating characterisation any longer. I don't know how the ending of this can make up for how dreadfully painful the first, at least, 8 episodes are but the ending seems to be why so many people love this? I just can't comprehend how it can be so good to outweigh the faults of this show- but like
                  I said, I'll probably come back to this one when I have more time to waste on it.",3

                Listen, this anime is really good, but people need to relax about it. Far be it for me to tell people that what they gleaned from this anime is anything less than life-changing, but to me, it was just... good. 
Right off the bat, the art turned me off. It still kind of does. I got used to it, but for my personal preferences, I disliked it a lot. The haziness of it irritated me, and the overall character designs weren't my cup of tea. That describes my experience with the sound design as well, though the voice acting is amazing. 
I'm gonna tell you
                  that this anime is probably gonna confuse the hell out of you more than it won't, but that's par for the course with time travel storylines. Speaking of the story, let's talk about that. I think the reason this anime is currently holding the #2 spot on MAL is because of how well this anime is written. I do have my negatives, but I'll get to that in a minute. As far as I could tell, there weren't a lot of continuity errors; I'm pretty sure everything that you see on screen, regardless of if it confuses you at the time, gets explained and integrated into the story. Aside from that, though, the actual story is just really good. There's not really any technical mumbo jumbo I can word that with; it's just a very strong narrative. I didn't get anything super deep out of it beyond a cool story about time travel, but hey. 
The negative aspect I found with this story is that a few things that happened, or rather, a few of the things that were explained were kind of... overly convenient? Almost like it was lazy writing. This anime is as scientific as it can be considering the fact that time travel isn't actually real, but a few of the events that occurred were more like something that happened by coincidence, which made it a little bit of a letdown compared to how cool it could've been if it had an actual reason behind it. In addition, sometimes stuff would happen suddenly just for the sake of drama, and it kinda made me think ""why'd that happen, that was sort of lame."" It's very difficult to explain that without specifics, but that's the best way I can say it.
Character wise, this anime is close to flawless. My only couple qualms were that the whole ""mad scientist"" thing, while charming for most of the anime, was a little bit off-putting at the beginning because I wasn't aware that his character was like that (more of a personal issue than anything). Also, there was a character or two in here that didn't really lend anything to the story. They were more or less there to fluff the plot in places, but not really for any other reason. Besides those couple of things, the characters and their relationships to each other were done really nicely. It all came off very realistic, especially the relationship developments. Normally, I'm a proponent for character backstories and development, but I'm glad there wasn't too much in this anime because I feel like it would've muddied it. 
I don't know, the time travel aspect of this anime is done extremely well. It's interesting and well explained. I don't think it's something I've never seen before, but it does what it wants to do well. I think you'll really like this anime if you watch it. It deserves the score I gave it, but it isn't something that blew me away. Do with this what you will. If you want a good sci-fi, though, you can't go wrong with Steins;Gate.",8
"
                Whenever you watch a lot of anime, or review a lot of it, generally you hear of things from others about certain ones. For example, I heard that anime like Big Order were terrible thought 'they can't be that bad', and ended up regretting it. Then, I hear how an anime like Steins;Gate is absolutely fantastic, think 'it can't be that good', and have my expectations blown away by something extremely enjoyable and intelligent.
 First of all, the story. The setup is about time travel, and that subject can lead to something amazing, or it can fall apart and be completely terrible. Fortunately, Steins;Gate is
                  very intelligent with its subject matter, treating it with grace and using it as a tool instead of a crutch. The pacing, the twists, the dramatic reveals, and the intense moments all culminate together to create a beautifully crafted tale that is gripping from beginning to end.
Even better than that are the characters, who were exactly what a thriller needs, as in, they were very likable. Okabe is very dramatic, cocky, makes a lot of speeches, and his consideration of himself as a mad scientist make him very enjoyable, but his caring for his friends and his willingness to go so far to help people make him very likable and admirable. Makise was also great, as her often being at odds with Okabe provided quality entertainment. She also has an ego, but she is much more contained than Okabe, and is more grounded in reality. Mayuri, originally, was a character I expected to be annoyed by, due to her childishness. But, she wasn't. She was very likable and her happiness was infectious. She's helpful and funny and I cared about her. The final main character is Hashida, who is also great. A hacker, a subtle pervert, and a bit sarcastic, he was very entertaining. Side characters were really great too.
The only part that wasn't exceptional was the animation, which by all means is still good. But, not much that was really amazing happened, and overall it was just good. But, I didn't need big budget animation. I needed a good plot and good characters, which is what I got.
This is a thriller that gets it right. It gets you enthralled in the story and makes you want to see these characters get out okay. And through it all, Steins;Gate showed me that I don't always need big explosions and animation to have something that I can enjoy.",9

                Let's make this short and sweet...(Do read it, it will just give you the idea of what you're about to dive into...)
Story - 10/10
Steins;Gate is one of those rare anime which at one point feel like an utter waste of time. Sure, a scientist conducting unsuccessful experiments for a couple of episodes with a little bit of humor mixed in seems a bit dry, but then you come on that gut wrenching plot twist that makes you manufacture dragon balls in your stomach (that's a pun) and the anime just turns into the best thing you've ever seen. 
It's just like that, you're about to
                  drop it on one episode and the next episode whacks out the shimmies into your brain and you begin to think if you were retarded to even think of dropping this... :D
It holds up pretty well till the end and the final does not disappoint you and yet, leaves you hungry for more...
Without a doubt this is one of the finest anime ever made...
Art - 9/10
Steinis;Gate does not lack in art and White Fox does it's best to keep it that way.
It has a real world like feel, albeit a few gags incorporated which is by the way necessary for the story since they want you to feel it and the changes as the story progresses.
Kinda has a dark atmosphere somehow like Zack Snyder movies (I love him btw)
Sound - 10/10
The OST is just enough to create the atmosphere and does not interfere in your watching experience.
It's kinda like how M. Gustave describes a Lobby Boy in The Grand Budapest Hotel, ""He's always there but never noticed and only comes out when needed.""
Character - 10/10
The character development is very important for this type of anime and they manage it beautifully well, giving subtle hints when the characters' personalities change as a cause-effect chain of experiments takes place.
We do love the grandfather paradox here...(Psst, that's not a spoiler...)
Enjoyment - 10/10
This is truly a treasure for those who desire a psychological thriller that's beyond the conventions of, you know psychological thrillers... :D
All in all Steins;Gate is a full on dark, psychological thriller inspired by the amazing atmosphere Zack creates on his movies, and will keep you on the edge of your seat...(Don't fall down :D)",10
"
                Thought it was going to be an amazing show.  I forced myself through 8 episodes and had to drop it.  I can't bare how boring and uninterested the characters and the story are being portrayed.  The show has weird harem elements which I really do not enjoy.   Throughout the show, I tried to hard to like and enjoy the MC jokes and weird laugh but he is just OFF. 
Art:  The art style is this show is weird.  The characters have very dead-fish eyes.
Sound: Ok I guess.  I skip all intro and outro, nothing catchy.
Story:  Almost
                  interesting. but fail.
Overall: 3",3

                Ever seen an anime that is just perfect no matter how many times you watch....try criticizing or nitpicking the smallest of the flaws but end up not being able to find any? ‚Ä¶. Well, Steins;Gate is that anime to me.
Steins;Gate does what most anime.... or should I say most stories fail to do....
Getting everything right! And I mean everything!
STORY:
This is the kind of story that will take some time getting into as it tends to explore the relationships of the characters with each other....and the personalities of each character as the story begins and in some cases you'll hear people saying they dropped it after
                  the first five episodes because they didn't feel like it was going anywhere in particular....
Yes, it can feel like a slice of life in the beginning....but that's just the writer giving us slow burn for what's to come. 
The importance of exploring the character relations and focusing on individual characters to develop them will be understood by the viewer once they reach episode 12 when a certain something happens changing the story's flow in a direction which nobody would have seen coming.
The impact of what happens in that episode and everything from then on will not be felt by any person who did not learn about the characters in the first 10 episodes. At first glance those episodes look like a waste of time...but in my opinion those episodes are more important than anything else in the story as they build the base for everything that happens later on
ART:
This is the only part of the anime that is not perfect. Now don't get me wrong.... Not perfect doesn't mean not great. In fact the art style of this anime is fantastic and memorable to the point that I don't ever wanna see a different style for it. But in terms of how inch perfect the rest of the aspects are...This falls short only by a little as I wouldn't necessarily think of this as one of best art styles I have ever seen.
SOUND:
Now here is the real deal... Most people don't really notice the soundtrack when it comes to Steins;Gate or at least not anyone that I know. But trust me Steins;Gate has some of the most amazing soundtracks that I have ever heard period! It fits the tone of the show perfectly and blends in so well with it that it makes me think that perhaps that is the reason why so many people don't notice the soundtrack.
Character:
In this department I really have nothing to say....earlier in the review i mentioned how important the first few episodes are in order to fall in love with the characters. Credit goes to those episodes again for making these characters feel like family. Especially the two main leads Okabe Rintarou and Makise Kurisu.... the amount of development they get throughout the story is mesmerizing.
Finally I would like to say that if anyone has been planning to watch this masterpiece for sometime but isn't sure...just go for it...and trust me you wont regret watching a minute of it by the time you reach the climax",10
"
                (Please read to the end of the review as the beginning is a bit misleading)
Honestly when i started this show i really hated it. I hated the pacing, characters and pretty much everything except the conspiracy theories and discovering the effects and limitations of altering time. i forced myself to continue watching because surely an anime in the top 5 would be amazing at least later on. so i kept telling myself that surely it'll get better soon.... And boy was i right!
around 12 episodes the whole show changes pace and feel and most of the characters change from being really annoying to really easy
                  to connect with and the shows pace speeds up a LOT. It changes from learn one key detail each episode to having a whole movies worth of content in each. when i got to episode 12 i switched from forcing myself to watch and episode or two in between other anime to literally watching half the series in one afternoon. 
Basically (in my opinion) if you can make it through the first 12 episodes the later 12 will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you think to yourself ""one more episode"" after every single one. 
Also as a side note I heavily recommend anyone who finishes the series to watch Steins;Gate: Oukoubakko no Poriomania as well. It's basically a bonus 25th episode that adds a bit more closure to the main series.",9
"
                The amount of detail and references to different themes you see in life is just amazing. I have never been able to get a level of excitement, enjoyment, and interest in any other show I've ever watched. I've watched so many different anime and out of all of them this is easily my favorite. No, I don't think it's the best anime ever, I simply love it because of the characters and story. I love the different kinds of theoretical sciences applied in different scenarios throughout, and recommend this show to anyone with even the slightest interest in space, time travel, and science in general.

                Okay im writing this from the future me. telling me to watch this when it comes out. I remember watching the first couple of episodes and dropping it because it has such a slow start. But keep watching, you will regret watching this in 2018 because you will not forgive yourself for years of wasting your boring holidays and never watching this. Yes it has an incredible slow start but the character development is worth it! after episode 5 you start getting hooked, from episode 12, omg, I just hope you arent watching this during your end of year exams. 
              ",10
"
                I initially watched the first episode of Steins;Gate many, many years ago - maybe back in around 2014. I was turned off by Okabe's nonsensical (in my opinion then, cringey) behavior and I found the plot confusing. 7 years later, I picked this anime back up, and I'm so glad I did, because once you get past the first few convoluted episodes, the plot really picks up and the reason why this show is considered a masterpiece is revealed. 
The story is so interesting, the premise is unique, and most importantly, the characters are so well done. The gaudy personality of Okabe that I initially
                  disliked, I eventually became fond of, even missed as the show got darker and darker and Okabe grew more withdrawn. There is so much depth to each character, and you get attached to every one of them. This show made me laugh and cry, sometimes in the same episode. I'm usually not a fan of romance in my non-romance animes, but this one made the relationship and connections feel genuine and tender. It's the kind of show that makes you reflect on your own life and perception of the world. If there's anyone out there who, like me dropped the show within the first few episodes, give it another shot. I promise it's worthwhile.",10
"
                Okay, to start with, I can't really elaborate on the background music. I listen to the opening and closing songs exactly once, unless I really, really like it. I have the show to get to, and the opening and closing tend to draw up time I could spend watching more episodes. Also, I don't pay much attention to the background music, unless it's really jarring, or absolutely outstanding. I'm too focused on what the characters are saying.
There's a good reason for that. 
Steins;gate is a show that you must pay full attention to. At any given moment, the plot relates highly to time travel. Surprisingly,
                  the science isn't entirely crap pulled out as a cheap excuse for time traveling. Most theories can't hold water anyway, as they can neither be proved nor disproved. However, the theory of ""world lines"" is a rather fun one, clearly an offshoot of multidimensional theory. In essence, the pseudo-science doesn't detract from the plot, and clearly gives a good reason for what is going on.
Which brings me to the plot. Simply put, it's great. At first, the series seems like a comedy. An eccentric main character, a geeky major character, and then Mayuri is just Mayuri. People make jokes, play tricks, act crazy in general, for about the first half of the series. They go out to make the world a better place. Then the show realizes it needs to compensate for the humor, and divebombs into a dimension of emotional pain few shows can represent. I couldn't stop watching, pardon the cliche, because I had to know what came next. The show felt as if physically ripping out my own heart would be less painful than watching the next episode. And yet, continuing was a necessity, because it could not end there.
Character development was decent, as different sides to each character were shown. Despair, joy humor, love, all were shown. I can't elaborate on that too much, because spoilers.
 Overall, I found the show to be extremely enjoyable. It starts off somewhat slow, but everything makes sense as the series progresses. There are a few plot holes, but the quality of the show as a whole compensates for this easily. If you aren't immediately addicted, stick through it anyway, it's a very rewarding experience.",10
"
                Holy! 
In my opinion one of the best anime I've watched so far. If not the best.
I waited a long time watching it: I watched a trailer and read what it was about, and really wasn't that interested. The setting seemed weird to me. 
Sadly, it has a really difficult start, the first few episodes are hard to follow without further knowledge on what is going on, but it is definitely worth it to continue watching.
Action, Drama, Romance, and a really touching story with absolutely awesome characters. Hell, it even made me cry at some certain point.
So if you like fantasy, time travel, a bit
                  of a crazy main character and some bits of romance, this will be perfect for you.",10
"
                While I loved this anime, I have to admit, I found it hard to get into. I loved the characters and everything, except the plot. It seemed to be very repetitive until suddenly, something happens that I am not allowed to say, and out of nowhere, it becomes one of the best anime I have ever watched. I didn't appreciate the beginning, but now I have finished it, nothing happened for no reason. Even the random parts in the beginning that didn't seem to mean anything became a giant part of the story.
In my opinion, it was one of the best anime I have ever
                  seen, and I'm glad I didn't drop it when I was about to.",10
"
                I have so many thoughts about Steins Gate (both good and bad) that I don't even know where to begin. So I'll start with this: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD in this review.
Having heard of Steins Gate's popularity for years (and seeing that it was #4 on MAL) made me want to finally check out the show for myself a week and a half ago. I wasn't hooked right off the bat. The D-mail experiments were interesting, but I wasn't understanding what it quite was that made everyone lose their minds over this show. Then I got to the middle. Wow. All the D-mails coming to fruition,
                  Mayuri's death, and the endless time loops were what really stuck out to me. I was suddenly more invested in the story than I had been before and was curious how the main characters would try to defeat fate.
The writing in this show is phenomenal. I will give it that. I think Steins Gate executes the concept of time travel practically flawlessly (and I've watched A LOT of time travel anime). It perfectly set up its beginning episodes to complement the ones that followed in the middle and completely circled back to its beginning episode in the end. I never felt confused and occasionally was awestruck by revelations (at the end when Okabe stabs Kurisu? I SCREAMED). I felt that this anime was really going somewhere, and while I never thought it was flawless enough to warrant a 10 on MAL, I thought a 9 was well-deserved.
And then things took a turn with the last few episodes. As someone who has consumed a lot of media, I am no stranger to the fatal flaw of this show that has plagued many like it. The romance.
Let me paint you a picture of what I witnessed in this show, and then the direction it went. It's no secret that Okabe flirts with a lot of women on this show, but during the middle of the series, when Mayuri is murdered in front of him, one thing was clear to me. This was someone very important to him. Someone he loved. There were many points leading up to this moment in the show that made me think this. One great example I can think of is when Okabe is receiving ominous texts from SERN, and his first thought is to run back to the lab to make sure Mayuri is okay through a pretty amazing animation sequence. Up to this point, while the two had been portrayed as friends, there was no doubt in my mind that their relationship went deeper into something that was emotionally-complex and quite honestly, beautiful. I think the dream sequence that Okabe has of Mayuri around the time of her death is testament to this, and even the opening puts such a large emphasis on them that I knew their relationship had to be one of the major focuses of this show.
Once Mayuri dies and the time loop begins, it is clear how much Mayuri's death torments Okabe, and it's easy to see she is his priority with the sacrifices he asks his friends to make to try to save her. The latter half of the show is heavily Mayuri-focused, and as Okabe tried again and again to enter into a world line that would allow Mayuri to live, I was looking forward to see how that would be accomplished and how their relationship would progress. From my understanding, seeing how important Mayuri was both to Okabe and this arc in the show made it so I had no doubt in my mind that eventually Okabe and Mayuri would enter into a relationship. 
And then in Episode 22 Okabe confesses his love for Kurisu. I'm sorry, what?
I won't pretend to deny that there was flirting occurring between the two, but at the end of the day, I saw them only as friends. They lacked that emotional connection and beauty to their relationship that Okabe and Mayuri had, and while Okabe was clearly distressed to go back and alter the world line, causing Kurisu's death by doing so, I assumed this conflict was because, like Okabe has demonstrated before, he wants to protect all his friends and keep them alive. I did NOT expect Okabe to confess his love out of nowhere and an awkward, out-of-place kiss scene between him and Kurisu. Afterwards, Mayuri is completely forgotten as a character.
Please tell me why I wasted my time sitting through so many episodes focused on trying to stop Mayuri's death when in the end, it didn't seem to mean anything for either Mayuri or Okabe. There seemed to be no closure between Okabe and Mayuri when it came to this event and the consequences it brought. During the time loop arc, Okabe is clearly distressed over his failure to keep Mayuri alive, and Mayuri misses his company and has suffers from remnants of memories of her being murdered. The two characters never discuss this despite it being such a pivotal plot point. Once they enter the world line where Mayuri lives, Mayuri only gives him an okay to go date Kurisu, and that whole multiple episodes of torment where Okabe is trying to prevent Mayuri's death is just seemingly forgotten, like it was just a bad dream, when in actuality I expected some real repercussions from all of this and some character development between the two. Hell, it doesn't even feel like their friendship has strengthened by the end of this. Their relationship feels no different from episode 1.
So quite honestly, I think this show would've been better with no romance at all.
Getting past the romance, there were other issues I had with the show. One had to do with its predictability. Now don't get me wrong. There were a few plot twists that shocked me. Suzu being John Titor was one, and of course Okabe being the one who actually killed Kurisu in the beginning (or did he? hmmm). That being said, I felt like I predicted every other major plot point - Mayuri's death, a plotline with Okabe going back in time to save her (I am not even kidding, I predicted this about five minutes into episode 1 because Mayuri had such *killable main character* energy), as well as Moeka having ill intentions, Mr. Braun being involved with SERN, Faris sending a D-mail to bring her dad back to life, the list goes on and on. I never felt like the show hid these facts that well, and that made me lose out on the fun of figuring out the mysteries of this show.
Prior to watching this show, I just finished watching Higurashi, another time loop show with very similar qualities to Steins Gate. While the shows are different, they share similar plotlines - repeating time loops and trying to defeat fate to stop a character's death (and Suzu and Rika share the same VA). I'm not here to argue which time loop show is better than the other, but there's something Higurashi does so much better when it comes to revealing mysteries. Higurashi always kept me on my toes and made me always stop and ponder, but I was disappointed to be predicting so many ""jaw-dropping"" moments in Steins Gate. Perhaps Higurashi gave me galaxy brain when it came to time loops, but I also think there could've been a better written mystery in Steins Gate.
I also felt Kurisu's arc with her dad was not given enough attention in the show to warrant such a strong emphasis in the end. It only comes up a few times, much less than the whole Mayuri time loop arc, and yet it plays such a big role in the final few episodes, and for what? Suddenly we're reminded that Kurisu's dad is a dick again, and it plays a role in her stabbing, but again, compared to the whole Mayuri death time loop, it just feels like such a minimal plot point in the entire frame of the show.
I also almost lost it with Suzu returning so they could prevent World War III in the final few episodes. Like, you're kidding me, man. What? Why do we need to throw this random ass plot point in too? Convenience-sake so we can save Kurisu? Yup, seems like it.
I don't know what it is about anime and their third arcs a lot of the time, but I just wasn't satisfied with the last few episodes of Steins Gate, which was such a let-down since I had been thoroughly enjoying it up to that point. My disappointment tonight honestly makes me not want to rewatch it anytime soon, which is sad, as I felt this was going to be such a good show, and while maybe not one of my favorites, an anime that I could fondly look back on and rewatch from time to time. But now I just get irked every time I think about the ending.
In conclusion, despite its flaws, I do still think Steins Gate is a really good show, far better than a lot of anime I've seen, and I won't deter the curious viewer from watching it, but as someone who was misled by the romance, let down by the mystery, and given an unsatisfactory conclusion, the highest I can really give it is an 8, and I definitely do not agree with its ranking on MAL, but to each their own.",8
"
                Not gonna lie, this show did start a little slow. It was difficult to get past the first few episodes but it quickly became less of a chore to watch as the show progressed. The second half picked up so fast that I ended up binging it in one day. The story went full circle and there was not a single detail that was missed. I absolutely loved the personality of the main character and I thought the premise of the show was interesting as well. I also appreciated the psychological conflicts that the main character faced as well as the ethical aspects of the
                  show in its entirety. 
Not a huge fan of the art style but that is just personal preference and its honestly not a huge deal. 
Im not a big stickler on sub vs dub either but this is one of those shows where watching sub adds to the experience.
I also enjoy a romance plot no matter what type of show im watching and the romance plot of this show was sufficient for me. 
Overall, I loved the cast, the attention to detail, and the show had me on the edge of my seat making it nothing less then a 10. Besides the fact that it started slow, it left me wanting nothing more and there were no loose ends at all. Might not be your cookie cutter action shounen but it was still fantastic giving it the number 2 spot in my limited anime list.",10
"
                So, this is my first review on this site, and it's only fitting that it goes to my favorite anime. Let's get started, shall we?
Story: 10/10
So, this is really one of two things I personally look for most in an anime. If it doesn't have a compelling story, I won't enjoy it. Steins;Gate more than meets this criteria, providing what has almost instantaneously become one of my favorite stories of all time. Part of this is due to the subject matter. See, time travel is a hard thing to write about, because both you and your audience need to know exactly what the rules are
                  at all times, and often these rules can be, to put it lightly, a tad bit complex. This show however, does this well, following the rules almost perfectly, with only a single hiccup towards the end of the series (Which admittedly can be explained).
All that being said, the show's greatest moments are its comedic and tragic ones. Makise and Okabe's verbal sparring is simply delightful to watch, while Okabe's moments of desperation are some of the most poignant scenes I can recall. 
It does however have one flaw that bugs me a lot. In my personal opinion, the fact that anyone besides Okabe can retain memories across timelines is laughable and unexplained. Yes, the show tries to make it poetic, but it just doesn't work. However, the show couldn't really get to the conclusion without it, as the writers seemed to write themselves into a corner somewhat.
Art: 8/10
The show just looks great. I love the colors, the character designs, all of it. Is it the pinnacle of animation? No. Does it look great? Yeah.  I suppose that's really all I have to say about that. I wish I had more of an opinion, but that's just it.
Sound: 9/10
The dub is perfect. Every character's voice sounds perfect to who they are, and it's clear that they were picked very carefully. J. Michael Tatum and Trina Nishimura in particular stand out as Okabe and Makise, and the rest of the cast does quite well too. 
While I didn't care a lot for the soundtrack of the show (mainly because I'm not a music person), it did work well I suppose. However, the opening, while it only plays three times during the whole show, is one of my favorite openings of all time, as it fits in perfectly with the show's themes and characters.
Character: 10/10
The other thing I look for in an anime, and where the show really shines. There are no bad characters. Each and every one gets proper development, and they really do feel like real people, with all the depth and flaws that come with it. 
The one exception to that is Faris. She makes no sense in the world. her artstyle doesn't really match, her backstory is confusing at best, and the show would quite honestly be exactly the same without her. 
Now, while the characters themselves are fun, it's their interactions that are truly amazing. Makise and Okabe's chemistry just works. the two characters play off each other in this perfect way that I'm not sure I've seen anywhere else. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
One complaint I've seen a lot is that Steins; Gate starts too slowly, only reaching the real driving force of the show around the end of one of the middle episodes. And while I can certainly understand such a statement, I personally disagree. Without the slow first half, you fail to acquire that emotional resonance with the characters that you need to enjoy it.  Plus, it's incredibly fun to see exactly how they get from point a to point b. And then, you know, back to point a. 
Another thing I'd like to comment on is the rewatch value. It's 100% worth your time to rewatch it at least once. Everything makes sense when you rewatch the first episode. 
Overall:
I could sit here and write that Steins;Gate is perfect in every way, and honestly, that's what I'd like to do. However, I can't, as, despite the awesomeness of it, it has a few issues. Its story occasionally relies on the deus-ex-machina of remembering things across timelines (which it really has to), and the art and music aren't top-notch. Despite this, I will gladly say that this is the best anime out there. Steins;Gate is  truly wonderful experience that I would recommend to anyone and everyone, more than earning it the score of 10/10",10

                Story: Being a person who put myself in the main characters shoes, i felt the full experience of the ride the story took me on through his eyes. The mystery, the love, the tragedy and pain, the sacrifice. All of it felt so well done, and i became very invested.
Art: The high score here is more for how well the direction and effectiveness the art itself is more than the pure visual fidelity of the drawing and effects. 
But the imagery used was still attractive and used great.
Sound: MY GOD THE MUSIC IF FUCKING GODLIKE, THAT OPENING IS GORGEOUS. The scores through out the show,
                  like the art, enhanced each scene masterfully. There are many moments where they use sound cues to make certain scenes hit much harder and definitely brought fear, happiness or tears to my eyes.
Character: I wasn't expecting to feel invested in each character... but then i was HAPPILY proven wrong. as the show unfolds more and more, the character investment eventually hits a high that makes key parts of the story feel so much more dramatic. Kurisu is life, and i felt what okabe felt. okabe's choices are very human. Every character has elements that make you want to root for them or make them relateable or make them tragic. 
Enjoyment: I will preface this by saying i watched with a friend on every episode, and enjoyed exchanging theories and banter as the episodes unfolded and paused at mind blowing moments to discuss how our theories were changing, so it might have been different than many of you. With that said, I can honestly say I enjoyed it well at the beginning, then got incredibly invested near the middle, then at the end i was so utterly satisfied that i feel the only score to properly give this is a 10. I couldn't ask for more.
Overall. 10, will leave incredibly positive lasting impressions, will influence my creativity greatly.",10

                Tuturu~
Once in a blue moon I chance upon an anime that knocks the wind out of me. The impression is one that I shall reminisce about for a long time. In all likelihood, it‚Äôs a feeling that I wouldn‚Äôt forget, even if I could. The impact is deeper than merely a story that was enrapturing and a bundle of fun. I‚Äôm talking about the magnum opus of Sci-Fi anime‚Äî Steins;Gate. Admittedly, the theme of time travel is no stranger to the realm of anime, so making a time travel story stand out isn‚Äôt as easy as shooting a fish in the barrel. Steins;Gate delves into
                  this realm of time travel and worldlines, putting in acknowledgements to bona fide theories viz. the butterfly effect, and how, once you alter even an inconsequential thing of the past, the future transitions into one large scrambled egg. The laws of time travel are possibly pseudoscience, but S;G sticks with these laws and makes it seem as though they are indeed the real deal. The story and narrative of this Sci-Fi gem is exceptionally well researched and meticulously hand-crafted; virtually like a luxurious item, with a sizable detail added to conjure up a plausible narrative of time travel and the anticipated catastrophic changes that come with it. In spite of being somewhat complex, the time travel mechanics hold together reasonably well, and are instrumental not merely as the prime catalyst for the plot, but also its resolution.
I‚Äôll be dead honest and say that the first few episodes are incredibly slow and random to a point where it may turn some of its viewers down. However, this rather slow start is actually of the essence in order to establish the nitty-gritty concepts concerning time travel which the anime utilizes, and setting the foundations for the characters and their relationships. Once it picks up, the mind-blowing Sci-Fi thriller fires up its engines, the intrigue and mystery kicks-off, and the pace of the series accelerates; putting its viewers on the edge of their seat. What follows is an enthralling plot, which managed to blow my mind each episode. The ending is equally spectacular, tying everything together like a dream, and even presenting a new perspective on prior events (I oh-so suggest rewatching episode 1 after you finish). The characters for S;G, as far as I‚Äôm concerned, are developed remarkably well, and on top of that are some of the most captivating fictional humans that I ever had the pleasure of beholding on screen; which is why I was also able to connect with them in terms of their emotions and goals. If I could travel back in time and tell myself to watch this modern classic sooner, trust me, I would. Alas, I don‚Äôt have a time machine to my name which will enable me to accomplish such a feat‚Ä¶ and after watching this anime, I think it‚Äôs opportune if I‚Äôd rather not haha. Every once in a while, an anime will spring up that will withstand the test of time and join the ranks of other anime series which are counted as one of the best ever created. In my humble opinion, Steins;Gate is one of those masterpieces. I‚Äôm not writing in hyperbole when I declare that Steins;Gate is the best anime that I have ever seen. Not only is it well constructed and emotionally resonant, but it‚Äôs also by far the best-executed time travel narrative that I have encountered. In my view, it‚Äôs pretty much an unprecedented piece of art, and I unreservedly recommend this anime to anyone who is even remotely interested after reading these aforementioned thoughts of mine on it.
This is the choice of Steins;Gate.

                I watched the anime and played the game almost at the same time. It is a totally different experience. While watching the anime you got to see the full picture and enjoying the story from a third person point of view. While playing the visual novel you are going along solely with Okabe's perspective; to be honest it somehow annoys me when Okabe is being too 'devoted' to every girls he encountered. The anime managed to remove the galgame element by getting to the true ending directly, putting the focus back on 'science', ' time travel' and 'relationship between Okabe/assistant, Okabe/Mayuri'. Overall the anime is
                  awesome. Ep 21 Paradox Meltdown is so damn touching, BGM and the realistic art are a plus.",9
"
                Incredibly smart and intricate story that is rewarding and concludes beautifully. The characters are animated, a lot of fun, and share some really hilarious moments together. The world around them is really unique and intriguing and it's cool to see how they interact in it. This show has some really good writing, it is incredibly smooth and easy to follow everything is planned out so carefully. The art and music are great additions to everything. I honestly couldn't name a single wrong with it, it's perfect in every way, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a smart and laid-back show.

                ""The universe has a beginning, but no end. ‚Äî Infinity. Stars, too, have their own beginnings, but their own power results in their destruction. ‚Äî Finite. It is those who possess wisdom who are the greatest fools. History has shown us this. You could say that this is the final warning from God to those who resist."" - Okabe Rintarou's monologue at the beginning of the series
This anime should be considered as a gem of its genre. It's the first anime that dive into a fairly complex and strange concept, Time, and turn that into a full-blown story. Regarding time travel concept, our knowledge about
                  it still in its infancy but the author of the visual novel really did a good job on making a good story filled with twist. The anime studio also did a good job in adapting this into an anime without shifting too much from the source. All characters are lovable. This anime takes a realistic approach on how it looks like when you gave a teenager a machine capable of altering past. They'll abuse it and they'll learn from it and then they adapt. Slowly but surely learn from their mistakes but when it happens, it will be too late.
Now, I'm trying my best to avoid spoiler and for all of you who want to watch it, you better be ready for some confusion. It's natural. The first 12 episode is kinda like a comedy gag at first. Not much progression in the story but after that, it's all break loose. The consequences of toying with time and space start to catch up to them and it's getting interesting after that.
My opinion? Watch this. You won't regret it. It's the best of its genre. This anime has everything you need. Funny moment, sad moment, tense moment, tearjerking moment, emotional moment, and much more.",10
"
                I'm very critical of the anime I watch I'm a firm believer that things like fan service, poor chorography, and to much light or to much dark are bad things in shows. While this has small amounts of all I'm quite pleased to say this show genuinely made me feel something for the characters that keep it afloat. I feel the development was excellent, plot progression was amazing and the plot forced me to re-watch to understand everything. That aside without spoiling I will say this show brought more feels out than Code Geass's ending. 
It portrays friendship as well as a love story brilliantly
                  while still managing to be dark and supporting humor. I was pleased with the lack of fan service compared to most show (I hate the stuff). The plot twist and turns had me constantly wanting more in fact I'd say I felt empty when it was over simply because the show had grown on me so much. The art is not amazing but it  works for this type of show! Simply thrilling I dare say!",9
"
                A show that lives up to the ego people give it. I like that, a lot.
Like most great shows, it takes a little while to get going, and definitely presents a little hill to get up first. But past that, it really is a great show. It's a show where I could (and did) easily watch 5 episodes back to back, without feeling drained. That to me is a sign of a great show.
I won't sit and praise every single thing it does right, but rather the things that it did right, despite my inital concerns.
Despite inital confusion about what's going on, the show handles
                  the time travelling stuff well, and keeps from making it hard to follow. I have to commend that, as it seems well thought out that way. It has a great plot pace, making you want to keep watching. The characters really hold the premise up, and offer a great deal of variety, making interactions very enjoyable.",10
"
                I am obsessed with time travel yet this is STILL the best use of the mechanic I have ever seen thanks to it's consistency. When writing a time travel story it is important to make it's mechanics clear so that the audience can understand what the stakes are. Unfortunately most shows throw all of it's established limitations out the window with no explanation the moment they want to play with a new concept, not so in this series.
That's impressive for a show with a suspiciously lopsided male/female ratio.
STORY: This is one of those shows that you stick in front of your friend and say ""just
                  trust me! The first couple of episodes might seem uninteresting the first time you watch them."" That's my way of saying STOP READING REVIEWS THAT MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS AND JUST WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE!",10

                Rating: 7
I have very, extremely mixed feelings about this series. I gave it a 7, but did not actually enjoy it that much. *This is probably going to be a random ranting post, you have been warned*
So.
The premise is great and the story is engaging and clever. The overarching story is not so big that you feel that it's over-ambitious, but meaningful enough and serves its purpose to keep the level of interest and excitement. There were many nice touches on character development and their relationships on each other, which is something that I always like to see. Lots of thoughts and details that can
                  be appreciated when you think back on the plot, and there were quite a few 'wow' moments. It's nice that I had to think and digest the plot and double back to watch some of the moments, and ended up being impressed by the connections and details. The art is great and I love all the character designs. Sound effects are pretty good and I absolutely adore the opening.
Here comes the real problem.
I really dislike Okabe as a character and this brings down the level of excitement and interest I could invest by a huge margin. He was okay and bearable in the first few episodes, sometimes even mildly funny. But I got tired of his antics and I just dislike the way he talks. Granted, he has his merits and I acknowledge that, particularly with how his friendship with Mayuri developed (and I love Mayuri) but those alone just weren't enough to make me like him as a character. And to me, MC is one of the, if not the most, most important factor when I judge my level of enjoyment of the anime. He was annoying to me after around 10 episodes and I was really tempted to drop the anime because of him. He's supposed to be quirky and weird because of his 'mad scientist' setting but it just failed for me. He was immature, and rash, and maybe these don't necessarily justify my dislike for him (seeing as he's one of the top characters on MAL, after all) but like/dislike is such a subjective opinion anyway. 
The other characters on the other hand, even if I didn't love, I did not dislike. Mayuri was great from the start and Suzuha was such a wonderful character as well. I don't really get the hype about Kurisu but she was likeable enough. Daru, Ruka, Faris, they were all relatable and fascinating characters. It's a pity that Okabe just did not charm me at all.
My dislike for the MC took away the majority of the enjoyment of this anime even though it has a great premise and story, and the rest of the cast is pretty amazing. I am probably in the minority on that Okabe opinion, though so for anyone who is looking for an intelligent, well thought out and well-executed anime, please don't hesitate to go for this one. Steins;Gate's take on time-travelling is unique and but not overly complicated. It is certainly more than entertaining and the story leaves a rather deep impression as it goes on.",7
"
                In my opinion the best anime. All Back to the future fans will like it. Nice characters, an amazing soundtrack and the extreme detailed story. If you haven‚Äôt seen this anime in 2021, pause every anime you currently watch and watch Steins;Gate! Especially the main character is very funny to watch. I like his acting like a mad scientist and the relationship to his friends. Also there are many plot twists and you can feel the emotions of the persons. In this anime with its 2 seasons and 48 episodes the viewers will see character development, intelligent strategies and conflicts between different groups. And the
                  story generates the feeling of something realistic. It gives many ‚Äû Easter eggs‚Äú like the computer IBM 5100 or the discussion about the time traveler John Titor which exist in Real life. Also they tried to make the story realistic and scientific. In this anime the viewers have a lot to think about. The characters, the storyline and how the time traveling works in this anime and about the moral to abuse not the inventions of science. 
To make a conclusion it‚Äôs a very good and emotional anime which makes you to think. It‚Äôs an exciting story and a lot of people have fun with it. Including me.",10
"
                ""Steins;gate"" is about mystery, conspiracy and time-travel but it was very different from what I expected. Instead of focusing on a human threat the real enemy is time itself. The main character is constantly faced with the inevitability of events and the consequences of changing the past, to the point it would drive a person insane.
The plot is pretty good but because time-travel is used it has some flaws. The shows theory on time lines isn't scientific but I do like it. Another problem is the view of the people who don't time jump but these questions are inherent to the subject and I won't
                  explain any further to prevent spoilers.
My main remark on the show would be that its roots as a visual novel are too apparent. Almost all side characters are female and have their own background and problems. I don't mind giving those characters more personality and I must admit they added some great comedy but it felt like the show was unravelling their problems one by one as if they were different options in a game.
""Steins;gate"" didn't meet my expectations though the ending was satisfying and it definitely changed my view on time-travel and time-leaps.
What I liked:
- Strong emotions such as despair and loneliness.
- Well entwined mystery: some things aren‚Äôt how they appear.
- Subtle romance
What I didn‚Äôt like:
- Slow start
- Sometimes resembles a galge",7

                I'm going insane with how good this anime is!! I mean, I haven't even finished it yet, but I just had to express how amazing it was. I wasn't actually planning on watching it anytime soon, because the art style isn't really my thing. But I'm so incredibly glad I did. I find Steins;Gate to truly be a 10/10 anime. The story is so interesting, it makes you think you've figured it out, but you haven't and it more than makes up for the art style. It has some pretty good humor too and actually makes me laugh out loud almost every episode. I'm positive
                  about all of the characters I've seen so far, but I especially like the main character Hououin Kyouma. I just find him to be really well written and if I met him in real life I would want him to be my friend ;)
If you're scrolling through the reviews because you're not sure whether you want to watch it or not, then here is the review that strongly advises you to check it out, because I'm sure you'll like it ^^",10
"
                My overall honest opinion of this is anime for me is a 6/10 since it isn't my type of anime to watch. It had one of the slowest first halves compared to any other anime I've seen; it was so bad that in the first 2-3 episodes I felt like gauging my eyes out because nothing was happening. Once it got to the halfway mark of the season it picked up a little bit better than the beginning which I can understand why most people don't like the first half since it's watching 12 episodes to get good when most series get it within the
                  1-5 episode range than 12. I powered through to the end and it had a pretty solid ending and don't know why they have other seasons of this show focusing on the other characters that lead to the same ending as season 1.
The characters weren't so great especially the main crew they were a little annoying except for Kurisu who wasn't so bad. The dialogue felt kinda cringy between characters and sometimes got repetitive. 
The story is like any other science fiction dealing with time travel and won't get any deeper with the subject.
The art and sound are great considering this is a madhouse animation.",6
"
                    Firstly, let me start by saying that this anime is fantastic and if you haven't watched it, please do immediately. As you can clearly tell, I love Steins;Gate. Now minor SPOILER ALERT! 
    A lot of people say this anime is original and it certainly is, though not 100% so. In my case, at least at the beginning of the series, I felt distinct Terminator vibes from the show. That sort of turned me off so my opinion of the show dipped a little, not because I don't like Terminator, but just because it seemed like Steins;Gate was
                  ripping it off. Well in basically an episode after that I was back in love. 
    The story executes fantastic twists and turns and foreshadows them so well that you can never say they pulled something out of their ass. The show's handling of time travel is so adept and skillful that I'm constantly comparing other works involving time travel to Steins;Gate. Usually when any kind of story involves time travel, I immediately, perhaps even subconsciously, lower my expectations for the story because as we all know, time travel is a very hard thing to get right. But Steins;Gate always raises the bar with each episode and then proceeds to break through that bar. 
    The only part of Steins;Gate that I rated less than an 8 was the art simply because I use shows like Unlimited Budget Works as the benchmark. This isn't to say that the art in Steins;Gate is bad, on the contrary, it's very good but it's just not the absolute best. Personally though, I'm not a stickler for amazing art and animation. After an anime meets an arbitrary baseline for quality of art, I mostly judge it for story. Exceptional art is just icing on the cake.
P.S. I really love the OP and ED. I'm always humming the theme songs without realizing it.
Edit: This review was extremely embarrassing to read after a few months had passed since I wrote it. Pretty much just blatantly fanboying all over this review. Anyway I revisited this anime recently and while I still can see why I liked this series so much, it isn't a perfect 10 for me anymore though it might be on the border. Anyway I bumped it down to a 9. Might go down or up in the future.",9
"
                Ahh.... Where to begin?
Well, I first decided to watch this anime because it's popular, and I had to watch Time Travel theme for the anime watching challenge. Needless to say, I didn't regret it.
Before watching this I knew about the ""I am mad scientist, sonuvabich,"" bananas in a phone microwave, and more recently, the ""Hououin Kyouma"" (which I found out the day before watching it). It had been a bit higher on my list because of the voice actor cast, but I still never bothered. Until a few days ago.
I knew time travel was coming in some way, but what Steins;Gate had was completely unexpected.
                  In order to avoid spoilers, I can't say anything, but it definitely doesn't feature conventional time travel. There is the butterfly effect, but in a different way, and that influences the story a lot.
I didn't expect the show's darker moments, but those made the story deeper in some ways. And there were comedic moments as well. Definitely understand the ""Thriller"" tag on My Anime List, though strangely enough, I didn't look at the tags before watching, or I guess I would have seen something coming. The mixed blend of all these elements makes Steins;Gate unique, and I can see why it's rated so high and why it's so popular.
Eh... the art. I don't pay as much attention to art as I could, and I'm not an artist or I might have more critiques. I liked the character designs and backgrounds and whatnot, so I thought that was pretty good. The animation is great as well (though I'm not a certified judge or anything).
Sound: As I mentioned before, I thought about watching Steins;Gate for many reasons, one of which included the voice actors. Hanazawa Kana and Miyano Mamoru are two of the most favorited voice actors on the site as of now, and it's understandable because I'm a fan too. (And a fan of quite a few of the others but let's not mention all that).
The opening song is amazing, I've always heard it and identify it easily in anime opening quizzes. The lyrics to the opening relate to the anime as well, with my limited knowledge of Japanese, I can hear about the ""world lines"" and all that. The lyrics change around the last few episodes, possibly to reflect them more. The first ending song (which plays for the majority of the series) sounds very beautiful and sad. Once you get to around episode 9, the song just gets sadder and starts playing at certain moments that make it feel more depressing. But I haven't skipped the opening or ending. They're just too good.
Character: I immediately knew who was narrating due to the voice, but I did not expect evil laughing mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, who is a bit of a chuunibyou, to appear. Nor did I expect all the other characters. I did have some theories about them as I watched, which were mostly proved correct (good foreshadowing?), and all the characters have their individual personalities, backstories, reasons for what they do, and uh... some have their plot twists. Very diverse and fun to watch. I don't know much about characters either but I thought they were great.
Enjoyment:
Definitely enjoyed this anime. As I began the anime, I thought maybe it was an 8, which is slightly higher than my average. Then I got to Episode 9. And the rating went to a 10.
The characters have their quirks that add some comedy to the series. It's not completely dark and dark and depressing, or I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did.
All the elements of the anime came together very nicely, and I enjoyed the anime a lot. Overall, after watching this anime, I understand its high score and ratings, and I would definitely recommend and rewatch this in the future. The only downside is, I can't watch it ""for the first time"" any more.
More Random
the ""Phone Microwave (Temporary Name)"" taught me the Japanese for, well, ""Phone Microwave (Temporary Name)"" so I guess I have Steins;Gate to thank. :)",10
"
                One of the most story driven and gripping anime of all time. Most Time travel stories focus on where the protagonists are going and what they are experiencing and Steins;Gate puts a twist on that. Take Doctor Who for example, The main characters fly round in the Tardis going places and exploring. The story of Steins;Gate focuses 
more on the Time machine itself and how it all works creating an intriguing plot.
 It may be slightly slow starting but it helps you become more involved and attracted to the characters in the Future Gadget Lab. There are also many emotional scenes in Steins;gate which really
                  hit hard. I'm not going to give away anything but even
when i am re-watching the show and already know what is going to happen i still find myself crying over these characters. 
The art style is a bit dark and gloomy but it really fits the mood of the anime especially. Getting to see the thoughts of the protagonist Okabe Rintarou really puts you in his shoes and drives you to watch more as you watch his desperate attempts fail again and again.   
Overall highly recommend, my all time favourite, 10/10",10
"
                I'd been recommended Steins;Gate by a friend, so trust me when I say I really wanted to like this series.  And while it wasn't... bad, I just couldn't get into it.  The premise itself is very interesting and I was looking forward to seeing it pan out, but I wasn't blown away by it.  As a disclaimer, I'm an avid (non anime, think Asimov etc) sci-fi fan so exploring themes around time travel is nothing new to me.
However for some reason I just disliked... all of the characters.  I guess the tropes they all seemed to be modeled after just aren't
                  my favorite.  But, the plot itself is interesting, the animation looks nice, and if I had enjoyed the characters I'm sure I would have found it more entertaining.  Unfortunately it has ended up on my list as an average anime I probably won't rewatch anytime soon.",6
"
                Anime did right.
Quick review:
- My Best anime of this genre and probably second best only to the cartoon(Avatar).
- Some episodes are too depressing to watch.
- Trapsssssss.- First 4-5 episodes you will probably understand noting but don't worry everything will catch up. (watched it in youtube and 90% of comments were wtf is this anime why is it no1 starting episodes)
- The story focuses on time travel which I think is one of the hardest subjects to pick for any anime and to pull up sensical meaning the entire series.
- If you don't like the si-ci factor don worry this series has good humor and romance touch which itself is enough for you to carry on the entire series.
- The story revolves around certain fixed Characters and are pretty well developed.
- Make sure to watch the anime in order to get maximum entertainment.",10

                Steins;Gate made me forget to eat and led me into what I now estimate to be a week of depression. That being said, it's an incredible anime.
Long reviews waste your time, so here's a short and sweet paragraph.
SG leads you to think you are going to watch a show about time travel. However, this show is about protecting one another and changing the course of history in the smallest ways you wouldn't expect. The feels in SG are soooooo heavy. The art is perfect for the storyline. It has this dark yet ambient sepia feel but in a subtle way so that you barely notice.
                  Another amazing thing this anime does is cut out the k-pop intro and outro. Every episode is a solid full one rarely displaying credits. The characters are beautiful. Nothing cliche here. The way they display these friendships and delicately tie together new relationships is unparalleled. The MC is especially unique considering his outlandish dialogue which feels odd at first but then certainly becomes admirable. I personally would've liked to hear some more memorable tunes for the soundtrack, but this is a masterpiece nonetheless. All in all, this is top 3 for me and a well deserved 9/10 on MAL.
Pros:
-Strong feels.
-Golden characters.
-Unbelievable plot.
-Perfect ending.",10

                Rewiew for Steins Gate !!
So, the story is nice, despite the fact that at the start of the anime, it take a bit of time to begin and continue. The story talk about time travel, and it's really intersting, because when you watch this anime, your brain is thinking about ""how, when, what"" and I think is nice. Add to this, the theme of the anime is complex, and the story is well done compared to the difficulties of the theme.
I personnaly liked the art, but I don't think it's exceptionnal too, I think you need to watch it to judge :)
Same about sounds, I
                  liked some, I disliked some, watch it and judge by yourself ! :)
Characters are cool, and there is a evolution; add to this, character design is nice, for exemple with Okabe Rintarou, which is unique : the maaaad scientist lol, and you can identify with all theses characters ! The story is well built for each characters.
Despite the fact that sometimes the anime can be slow, it still interesting, and I really enjoyed it, it's exciting !
I recommand you to watch this anime because the story is really interesting, same for the theme, and all that is well built !! Let's discover all the secrets of this cool anime !!",10
"
                This series was a big disappointment for me considering how highly regarded this show is by MAL users as evidenced by its average score. In my opinion, it was an average show where nearly nothing significant happens for the first 12 episodes and then shifts in tone during the second half. For a show to spend 12 episodes on slice of life interactions and failing to add any meaningful depth to its characters before the turning point in the story is unacceptable. Time travel is a tricky theme to pull off and I think Steins;Gate did a great job with it, but their execution of
                  the subject matter doesn‚Äôt compensate for the lack of character development nor justifies the slow and uneventful pacing of the first half. If the concepts in Steins;Gate were possible, I‚Äôd send myself a text to not waste my time on the first half of the show.",7

                I started watching this anime after I was intrigued by its synopsis and how it included sci-fi and mystery which were not common genres I‚Äôve seen. However I only binged for 3 episodes and got confused by a lot of things (probably because I was still quite young) and started to get bored and eventually dropped it for more fast paced anime at the time.
Even after a couple of years, this anime was always one I wanted to revisit, so on a spare weekend I decided to watch it from the start again ( since I had forgotten most of the plot) and I was
                  hooked. The colors, characters, and score all blended together in a peculiar way that made you question a lot about the plot and you are always on the edge of your seat trying to connect the dots through the subtle clues given in each episode, and all of this leads to a final conclusion that sates the appetite of your mind. 
Story
Each episode edges you a few details of the big picture, and you always have a few questions in the back of your mind. In my opinion this is deliberate and of the best ways to tell a story by giving small hints at the plot while also making pieces of the big story that all fit perfectly into the storyline.
Art and sound
The art of this anime is well drawn to show different emotions in different characters while also being complimented by the background sound effects and music, creating an atmosphere that is unique to each and every scene while giving signs of uneasiness when there is something that is yet to be explained explicitly.
Characters 
The characters of the story each have their own unique personalities and is excellently portrayed by each of their actions to their choice of words, and all of this combined make you feel a deeper level of connection since you can also see each of the characters imperfections and flaws.
Overall I enjoyed this anime for its splendid execution of story talking, intricate character design, and stunning art complimented by mood setting music. This easily one of the greatest anime released to this day.",10

                This Anime is my #1 favourite and top #1 anime I ever watched. At first, the anime seemed sooo boring and confusing...yet after 8th episode, the whole anime turned into a masterpiece. There is no match for this anime, this anime is unique in its own way and touches your heart with the amazing plot. The creator was a genius and the studios did an astounding job of animating the characters and the music was breathtaking.
I would honestly give this a 10/10 without hesitation.
Art - 10/10 : The animation art style is unique and beautiful.
Sound - 10/10 : Great music, you would listen even after
                  u finish the anime.
Characters - 10/10 : The character development is excellent. 
Enjoyment - 10/10 : Its just tear-jerking and happy.
Plot - 1000/10 : the plot of this anime is on another level.
Overall - 10/10 : It is just too perfect of an anime.",10
"
                It starts off a little confusing, but once episode two hits, the show really takes off. This series is equal parts thrilling, hilarious, and devastating, and the balance is absolutely perfect. The characters are memorable, the story is tight, and the jokes are legit funny.
And oh baby, I just love that opening theme. For other anime, I haven't given two thoughts about the theme song, but ""Hacking to the Gate"" is just incredible. The kinda song that I'd listen to outside the show (if they ever put it on Spotify).
This show's popular as hell, but if you're one of the few people who haven't seen
                  this, you should absolutely check it out.",10
"
                Been a long time since I've last watched an anime... I have been having trouble finding anything that keeps me hooked. Yet when I started this I was instantly sucked in and binged it all. By far my favorite anime I've seen so far. I will probably never find a better thriller anime. Every time I was going to go to sleep the anime left of on a heavy cliffhanger that made it impossible to stop. I really recommend this anime to anyone who hasn't seen it.
The second season wasn't quite as good, but was very interesting as it shows what goes on between episode
                  23 and episode 24. I recommend watching the second season if you haven't.",10
"
                ""Fool the world"", this phrase without any special context does not really sound very strong. The search for the Steins; Gate is one of those that transmit the most sacrifice and pain.
I will try to be direct and honest with my review.
Story: 10/10
A fairly faithful adaptation to the original story, although certain themes are deepened in the visual novel with greater attention and information.
In this story you can see a lot of creativity, love and dedication, without a doubt it is captivating. The connection that the work makes with history is very interesting, especially when it comes to time travel (you can imagine it). It
                  can catch us off guard because of how they pose the plot to us at the beginning, they take elements of reality as a basis, transforming a very solid work of science fiction, so much so that an ordinary viewer can believe that there is a small possibility of traveling in time. In these twenty-four episodes I did not find plot gaps that at least are too noticeable and finally I do not think it is a difficult story to understand (only if you pay attention, otherwise you can miss a lot of information), that is, prepare yourself with problems existential or doubts that you make about yourself in the course of history.
You may not get up to speed at first or find it a bit unnecessary and burdensome, but it's really just trying to the groundwork for the second half of the series. As a recommendation, pay attention to the details and what these chapters try to inform you. Once you pass the first half there is no going back, be careful with this, you will not be able to stop looking at it.
Art: 10/10
It suits this type of story very well.
There is not much to say, without a doubt I was in awe of those sunsets and the color palette used for this work.
There are not many typical anime expressions (not to say there are not) and its animation is not so dynamic, a great success since it accompanies the work very comfortably in my opinion. The design or characteristics of the characters seem interesting to me, in a certain part it could be said that it is a bit out of the ordinary. The way they interpret the city of Akihabara seems very good to me, they capture the characteristics of a city full of ""Moe"" and electronic products, this characterization being quite correct (in addition to being the perfect place for the laboratory of futuristic devices) .
Overall it's a pretty good animation for its year of issue and plays a lot with environmentalization and colors.
Sound: 9/10
One of my favorite sections in this review.
Wonderful, it accompanies the work at all times and they knew how to place it correctly in each situation. I Here made a distinction of each type:
-Opening and Ending: acceptable. It can be said that they are both quite decent and you may get a taste for listening to them multiple times.
-Soundtrack: this is one of the most important points. In my opinion they understood how to take advantage of the material they had available and they managed to make this work more epic than it is. It is very well placed in the plot and brings a lot to the viewer.
-Dubbing actors: I think it is a good contribution from them, they knew how to play the role of each character and thanks to this you manage to sympathize more with the characters. Very good work.
Character: 10/10
Very important in the work.
Well, as we know Steins; Gate talks about time travel and it's important to mention that there may not be a lot of character development, although you can empathize with most of them.
Since the only one who can retain the memories, even though he travels through time, is Okabe Rintaro, he is the one who brings the greatest development in this work. Their fears, insecurities and doubts are reflected and they change in each time jump. They show in a very similar way how psychologically a person can affect both the fact of being able to control the dimension of space-time.
In the rest of the characters, although they cannot be developed (because obviously he does not spend time on them), we have the opportunity to delve into them and know them too much. I would do the characterization of all of them, but I think it is better to see it in the work than through this review because it is very entertaining to see how Okabe relates to them in each time jump (being able to see for himself everything that a person can hide from them). others like, for example: Kurisu and her relationship with her father or why she acts that way in front of others). The list of characters is in the Steins section; Gate in the ""Characters and voice actors"" section, so it is not necessary to mention them.
They contribute a lot to the plot and give you the possibility to analyze their attitudes and characteristics, being very enriching in the work.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Well, this section is accompanied by the others.
Although I have said that it can start out being a bit heavy because of the information it contains or because of its slow start, I think it does not influence the entire work as much. As the story progresses they know how to generate an interest in the viewer and that is shown, each chapter there is something to be interested in. Although it is not an anime for everyone far from it. It attracts in many points such as the visual section, its interesting history, its charismatic characters and obviously in its development.
In conclusion, you are going to enjoy it, it has all kinds of feelings and moments in history (you can say that it can become a roller coaster) and, looking at it that way, I think this can give a point in favor since the work does not become linear or monotonous.
It is an anime that has many sides to attract you, both for its visual side, its story, the characters or simply its soundtrack.
Now yes, get ready because you may feel a deep void that probably other anime cannot fill. The Psy Kongroo ...",10

                The Travel Stories in time became something very common in recent times, culminating 80s which reached its highest peak with '' Back to the Future '' then here comes me Steins; Gate.
steins; Gate is an anime with a travel history of the fantastic time, you might consider one of the best of its kind, uses and abuses all the elements that compose transforming it into a work of suspense enigmatic, electrifying and sensational. The anime itself is a well-explained theory in its early episodes that function as a self-explanatory video of what's going to happen from now on, after only said the anime comes off
                  and loose his bonds, leading us to embark on a plot completely exciting, turning a huge puzzle to be deciphering that explodes our heads in the final episode, surprising with one of the best endings of all time.",9

                TUTURU folks :)
I'm not that much into science and time travel stuff but i decided to give it a try, because of the review and score. God do i not regret my decision!!! 
The show starts kinda slowly but it gives you a good background and you get to know the characters a bit more. Since the story and characters are without a doubt the main reasons that this show is so much praise, it should not stop you from enjoying it.
Speaking of characters, the MC (Okabe) is probably one of the most original character design i've seen so far. You'll learn to love himn
                  in all his crazyness.
You gotta give it a try!",10
"
                ""Consider. Can the universe be justifiably called infinite? Doubtful. It may not have an end, but it had a beginning. And its component parts certainly have a cosmological shelf life. If history has taught us anything, it's that scientists often make very poor poets. We're all just a ship of fools chasing phantoms, heedless of what really underwrites natural law.""
-Okabe Rintarou (Steins; Gate Episode 1 [Dub])
Steins;Gate is one of the few examples of a popular Anime, actually being masterpiece quality. The Anime tells a familiar, yet completely unique spin on the tale of time travel. 
There will be light spoilers
CONCEPT:
This is no Back To The
                  Future or Doctor Who story, this is something else entirely. Steins; Gate takes inspiration from the butterfly effect (indirectly mentioned) and the John Titor theory (directly mentioned). The first of which is the belief that one action will result in another to occur, as a side-effect (Say I threw a banana peel on the floor and someone eventually trips over it) ; the latter is the real-life story of the supposed time traveler called John Titor. In the story (which the Anime heavily takes from), John Titor is a time traveler from the year 2036 who was sent to the year, 2000, in order to stop a dark future, and the only way to do so is with an IBM 5100...in other words, it's exactly one of the main stories of Steins; Gate. Anyway, John Titor also proposes that time is like worldlines, where all these many worlds are seemingly connected to each other and work as fibers in a rope per se. These two theories are the time travel aspects that Steins; Gate takes from.
STORY:
How many times would you go back to save the ones you love? Would you rather know nothing, or everything that will happen; what if it breaks you mentally? Is our Fate pre-determined? Can we change that Fate? These are the questions that Steins;Gate brings to mind.
The story starts off at a slow pace (INTENTIONALLY). Okabe attends a lecture at his local radio building, with his childhood friend, Shiina Mayuri. He claims that the professor stole John Titor's theory and is quickly confronted by Makise Kurisu, a famed ""genius girl."" She asks him what he was trying to tell her earlier, but Okabe is somewhat of a social recluse and retreats into his HYOUIN KYOUMA mad scientist persona. Before exiting the building, he stumbles upon the corpse of Kurisu and immediately emails his friend, Hashida Itaru or ""Daru."" When he sends the email, the entire populace around him vanishes. He decides to meet with Daru, where he finds out that the text went back 5 days into the past, despite having sent it this morning. While talking to Daru, he realizes that his memory is not consistent with the reality that Daru describes (For ex. the professor's lecture was cancelled according to Daru). When their elevator opens, Okabe realizes Makise Kurisu is still alive. How?
CHARACTERS:
For anyone that says that this show has no character development, you are simultaneously wrong and correct in your thinking. This is one of the few examples of a show not needing character development, since we are dealing with time travel. You see, Okabe may be able to go back in time, but he's the only one with knowledge of going through time (Reading;Steiner). He alone can remember anything at all, meaning that there is no need for any of the other characters to change to begin with. This essentially means that he is the ONLY one who should have character development (Although I also love Suzuha's character, but I can't talk about her, due to spoilers). And oh boy what a fantastic character arc that he has. 
Yes, Okabe is supposed to be unlikeable. He is not your typical mc. In truth, he has social anxiety and uses the persona of kyouma in order to reach out to other people. It's a mask for him, since he is a social outcast. This is something that is conveyed to the audience through Kurisu. While other characters know Okabe way before the start of the series (exempt Suzuha), Kurisu doesn't. As such, she is completely thrown off by his character and often annoyed for the good chunk of the first half. However, as she gets closer to him, she adjusts to his character dynamic. Around episode 12, It goes much more into detail on why he acts the way he does.
Kurisu is supposed to be a viewer stand-in initially. Okabe, while not actually being one, displays many personality traits akin to Narcissism (I have 2 relatives who have been clinically diagnosed with narcissism and egoism, so trust me on that one):
-Immaturity
-Devaluing others whilst overvaluing yourself
-Overall Selfishness
-Believing others to be subpar to you
-Being gaudy and obnoxious
-Manipulative
-Unrealistic idealism/goals
Okabe pretends to be a textbook narcissist, NOT egoist (Narcissists are introverted in nature who put up an act of being extroverted but will back down when outmatched, egoists are extroverts in nature who do not pretend to be extroverted and will almost never back down). My explanation to how Kurisu can bear with it for so long, is simply that she recognizes that side to him and wants to help him (at least after some time passed since joining the lab). Kurisu is a scientist, it makes sense why she would study Okabe's behavior so thoroughly. There's many ways to analyze Kurisu's actions in this regard. 
SPOILER TERRITORY FOR THE ENTIRE SHOW:
Around episode 10-11, the plot really takes off. See, the first ten episodes or so were to establish this world and its characters, before tragedy strikes. And when tragedy strikes, no one is hit harder than Okabe. During episodes 12-14, Mayuri dies, due to the email that Okabe sent in the first episode (I love it when Anime medium makes the first events we see the most significant later). He forces himself to constantly try to change Mayuri's Fate (even contemplating suicide later if it saves her). No matter what he does, Mayuri still dies (gunshots, train deaths, run over by car, she even dies in her sleep at one point if I'm not mistaken). The point is that her death is Fated, he can't change it, despite his best efforts. This leads him to escape into fatalism and eventually, he isn't even fazed by her death any more. With each time leap, he increasingly draws attention to himself with his bizarre actions that are unfit for his character (Before all this time leaping he professed himself to be a cheesy mad scientist with a loud, flamboyant persona; it's revealed to us through flashbacks that he only chose to be that way originally to provide comfort to Mayuri; after all these time leaps, he just can't bring himself to act that same way as he's devastated by the pain he's gone through over...and over.....and over again). Kurisu catches on to his pain, and he starts to incorporate her into his plans. With their combined intellect, they manage to find a solution: Go back to the original worldline (Alpha worldline) in order to save Mayuri. It's then that we're hit with that reveal, after spending so much time with Kurisu, that she dies in that world. Okabe needs to go back to that world in order to save Mayuri; there is no other way.",10
"
                It's rare for a show to live up to the hype, and Steins;Gate is the rare example of one that does. The series is simply excellent, and I genuinely think it deserves it high praise.
This is one of the most intelligent series I've ever seen, and probably one of the best uses of time travel.
The characters are definitely the standout for this series. Okabe is one of my favourite protagonists in all of fiction, and Kurisu isn't very far off.
While it does take a while to get going, the payoff is just so amazing that it's worth the wait.

                One of the greatest animes I have watched without a doubt! Every time I watched an episode I thought about those who spoke of dropping this or saying that's it boring or confusing and just-- wow wow wow! Watching this is akin to walking up a flight of stairs, never tripping or falling, and as you get closer to the landing you run up and maybe even take them two at a time. The story's progression is truly seamless. Those lighthearted and easy going moments and the simplicity of the first few episodes were necessary imo because it shows you how much has changed, how
                  much was lost and it really takes Okabe's character to another friggin dimension.",10
"
                Did you ever regret something in your life that you want to go back in time and change it? 
Steins;Gate just gave me the time-travelling experience I've been yearning. I love how uniquely it was delivered in this anime. The plot was executed perfectly. The pacing is just right. I like how the story started to be so light and comedic and ended up thrilling and tragic. At first you will just think that the protagonist and his gang are all crazy and if ever they invent such time travel machine, they will just use it for fun and make their lives better but hell
                  no did they experienced such joy when they invented the phone microwave. That's where the story started to be more engaging for me. There were little fillers but all of these little stories did not affect the level of hype I feel while watching this anime in one sitting. 
Overall, this anime just earned the TOP 2 spot on my list. 
I give it a 10/10.",10

                Story: 8/10
Steins;Gate is about an eccentric mad scientist called Okabe Rintarou and his two lab members, Shiina Mayuri and Daru formed this lab called the ""Future Gadget Research Laboratory"" where they make futuristic gadgets (obvious enough). However, all of their inventions are extremely boring and useless, and the only one that's even remotely interesting is the Phone Microwave which turns bananas into oozing green gel. But, when Okabe sends a text message to Daru, whose phone was connected to the phone microwave, he discovers that the phone microwave can send text messages into the past. And what's more, the words they send can effect the
                  flow of time, and have unforseen, far-reaching consequences... consequences that Okabe may not be able to handle. Being a fan of science-fiction, and also time-travel fiction, this was the reason that made me watch Steins;Gate. So, if you're a fan of science-fiction, I'd seriously advise you watch this. If you're wondering, yes, I did rip off most of this from MAL.
Animation: 9/10
I really love the animation for Steins;Gate. Just looks awesome. Well, anything above the year 2000 should look good, but there's just something about Steins;Gate for some reason that just makes it look even more awesome. I don't know, maybe I'm high when I watch Steins;Gate,  so everything looks fascinating.
Sound: 8.5/10
HAH! I put a .5 there! What you gonna do, huh? Anyway, the soundtrack for Steins;Gate is amazing, and the opening is also great. Everything to do with sound is awesome, aight? AIGHT MATE? Even their voices! FASCINATING!!!!!!!!!!!!
Characters: 9/10
I like almost every character, well, main character, I'm not too sure about other characters, don't know. Anyway, every character is pretty well developed and there didn't have to be more work done on them. They were all pretty much developed perfectly. Okabe Rintarou's character development throughout the series is probably my favorite one. Favorite character, right there.
Overall: 9.5/10
The anime had an awesome ending, the OVA was quite good, not too good, but it was pretty good and the movie I especially liked. This series has got to be one of my favorite anime series of all time and take note of the ""one"" because, that's important. I'm not saying ""THIS FOCKIN' ANIME IS A MUST WATCH U STUPID FAGGOTS CUM WATCH IT NAO!!"" I'm just saying it's one of 'my' best anime series of all time. But... it pretty much is one of ""the"" best anime of all time because it's rated pretty highly...

                Steins;Gate is the anime based Visual Novel, Steins;Gate associated with the Science Adventure series. This series is the gaming franchise produced by the collaboration between 5pb and Nitroplus. There's a intersting facts about Steins;Gate 
-SERN is most likely based-off of the Europan Organization for Nuclear Research, a.k.a CERN. 
-John Titor is indeed a username used on bulletins, during 2000-01, claiming to be a time traveler from the year 2036. He was also sent back for an IBM 5100, in order to prevent the Year 2038 Problem (2K38 Bug). In Steins;Gate, Suzuha Amane goes back to recover an IBN 5100 to stop SERN.
-The D in D-mail
                  stands for DeLorian, which is popularly known from Back to the Future. Fitting for the messages, since they are the cause of returning to the past.
-channel is the anime equivalent of 2channel. 
I like this series because the story has a goal and  the character's personality is very insteresting.
And this is my Review.
Story:
The story makes you thinking fully, this story can makes you know about time traveler knowledge which has not been ascertained in the real world (maybe). John Titor and Dr. Pepper (drink), this person and drink apparently exist in the real world. John Titor is the guy who claims to be a time traveler and Dr. Pepper is the drink like Coca Cola. The comedy of this story so anti-mainstream, that joke understandable by some people. This story was good because the main character want create the time machine and stop the SERN invasion, he want to get the IBN 5100 to do his goal.  
Art: 
White Fox so great to makes Steins;Gate. The art character and the place almost same with the VN, the art was bit detail and i like the art of face character but the lighting seems to me a bit dull.
Character: 
The character not makes me boring, the main character, Okabe Rintarou is funny guy, that sound like guy in choir, he's bit smart and kind to the some people (he want to save 2 heroines, Mayuri and Makise). The heroine, Kurisu Makise is the girl who liked experiments on research, she also wanted to help in making the time machine and test the time machine so she believed that the time machine existed. She is tsundere makes she personality cute. And Mayuri, she is the cheerfull and most kindly character in Steins;Gate, she is a person who help in making the time machine, she always support Okabe in order to Okabe successfully to create a time machine, she is the girl who very important for Okabe, i like Mayuri because she is very friendly.",9
"
                I simply couldn't get into this gated community...  
The first half of this anime is all about character development.  It's light hearted, goofy and... painfully boring.  If you're not a fan of the characters within the first few episodes, my advice is to prevent yourself from watching any further. In order to get to any sense of urgency, danger or even interest, you'll have to wade through four hours of dialogue-rich and cicada buzzing background noise.  If this was any other show, I would have dropped it much sooner but out of respect to its status and regard, I had to
                  watch it all the way through.
Then came the second half. For me, it never seemed to click. There was a brief moment where I thought, ""Oh yeah, this is about to get good.  This will be a tale of two halves."" It stays good for about two episodes and then it wears itself out.  It's at that point I realized that I was in too deep to let go but too far removed to ever give a damn. By the time the show had a heartbeat, it was too late.  My interest flatlined. 
Amongst a cast featuring an overweight pervert, a cafe maid, Mr. Clean's third cousin, a scientist who isn't quite as confident as he seems, a secret ninja warrior with a bad haircut and a few others; the true standout is... Mary Jane from Spider-Man.  
Kurisu carries the show the same way Brian in Family Guy provides a voice of reason needed to balance out the personalities in Quahog.  
As a man who tried this flavor of tea for 24 episodes, I cannot recommend this unless you're into that flavor of green, jelly-banana tea :P",5

Amazing show, only character I hate is Daru. Perverted asshole. Just a gross person.
Also the first 10 episodes were very slow. 
But besides that it's an amazing anime. One of the best I've ever watched. 
Apparently the Organization does not want me to review this. They say my review must be longer. The Organization agents have even infiltrated MAL. Nowhere is safe. Stay safe out there.

                  It has a lot of text, especially at first.
  For someone who's just looking for action, They won't like it, but if you look calmly the series will catch you before you know it, the plot is amazing and I've never seen a series treat time travel so respectfully before.
  Normally when in a series time travel is always a mistake arises, however this has not been the case.
The story, the characters are all amazing, so it's nice to watch anime.
The opening and character designs are spectacular too.Kyoma has earned my respect.
I don't think I'll ever forget about this anime

                Okay so... Heads-up: i only managed to watch 7 Episodes so my rating might be flawed as i often read that it only really starts in the second half.
With that out of the way lets come to the actual review.
What makes a good anime? There are several things.. From a good story that manages to catch you right from the start to relatable characters.
Perhaps one of the biggest factors in my eyes however is the time and place you watch the anime for the first time. ""Kimi no na wa"" for example holds a special place in my heart because i saw it for the
                  first time in an airplane on my way back from japan and it awoke so much nostalgia over the trip i just did, that i just had to like it. (Ofc it just is a really good anime as well xD)
As for Steins Gate: i've honestly tried so many times to watch it and i never found the ""right"" time and place to enjoy it. The preconditions seem so right: i love crazy scientists, it has an insanely good score on MAL, the time travel theme should in theory interest me and you can never go wrong with harem... BUT... Somehow it never clicked... My record is forcing myself through 7 episodes and there are a lot of times where i quit way before that. The beginning just seems so underwhelming and outright boring. The Characters until there are just plain, stupid and annoying parodies of anime stereotypes which can be okay (see One Punch Man) but somehow it wasn't that ""self-aware"" kind of parody i felt... The Story was, to be frank, just boring as fuck. I mean i get that there is a need for build up but that doesn't mean that you don't have to put any effort into the first part at all.. You could at least try to build an emotional investment in the characters. Idk i just never got that which is why i ditched the Anime and i probably will never finish it.. And to be honest: even IF the second part is worth a solid 10 together with the first part being barely a 3 in my eyes, it averages out to be a 6 which is not worth the effort with so many good anime out there.",3
"
                Ok. Heeeeere we go. Time to write a review on my #1 favourite anime. Where do I even start? It's really hard to write a review on something like this.
Let's start with the story. 10/10 story. The story is actually insane. Once you really get into it, it basically just amazes you. It's about a ""mad scientist"" named Okabe Rintarou (who is also one of my favourite anime characters ever) who has a room called ""the future gadget lab"" above a bike shop. He has 2 friends with him, Hashida Itaru AKA Daru, and Shiina Mayuri AKA Mayushii. Together they run this lab. The whole
                  lab thing changes when they invent a new gadget called the ""phone microwave"" which is able to send text messages through time. I don't wanna spoil too much, so I'm not giving away too much information.
At first, this anime just feels normal. There's no anime tiddies, no epic op fighting scenes or anything like that. It's like you're there with them. The first few episodes seem mostly like normal life. Just like how all good stories begin. They can start off slow and boring, but that always pays off in the end. And boy does it pay off in this anime.
Moving on to art, 10/10. The art is a bit like classic anime, kinda Evangelion style, but with a modern touch. The art is just so good for some reason, and I can't really explain why. It might be the lighting and the depth of some shots, because some shots really do look absolutely stunning. It might also be that some shots have a significantly smaller colour pallet. Some shots kinda lack colour, which in my opinion looks really cool. You can kinda see what I mean if you look at the background of the cover of Steins;Gate on MAL. The art in the opening is amazing. The glitch effects, clocks, codes and other stuff just looks so cool.
Sound is a 10/10. Opening song is one of my all time favourites, voice acting is on point, and all the sound design is amazing. I especially like the sound of crickets that you can hear in many scenes. You can hear it fade in before the scene. When you hear it, you know you're watching Steins;Gate.
Character is a 10/10. In my opinion, there is no character that is less interesting than any other. All characters are super likeable, and some can get mysterious, in the best possible way. The characters are so well thought out and there is no unimportant character.
I really cannot explain how good this anime really is, and how well made and well thought out it is. It gets the concepts of time absolutey correct, and there are no plot holes that I'm aware of. No anime has ever had a better connection between everything before for me. The ending was amazing and literally nothing was left out in my opinion.
This is by far the best anime that I have ever had the honour of wathcing. It might even change how you look at anime after you've seen it. It is the easiest 10/10 that I have ever given. If it sounds good to you, please do watch it.
I'd also like to mention Steins;Gate 0. Apparently, you shouldn't watch it. Yes it has a good score and all, but if you're completely new to Steins;Gate, don't watch Steins;gate 0. I haven't seen it though. But in the words of my brother, it sorta ruins the story and the way you see the anime.
But that's pretty much all I had to say. This anime is just insane. And if you plan to watch it, be ready for a fkn rollercoaster. Hopefully you found this review helpful, and I hope you'll have a good time watching it.
Tutturu~!",10

                Like most people, I found Steins;Gate hard to get into in the begining, as the first few episodes don‚Äôt really cover much ground. It's started a little bit confusing and not good built-up.
But you just need to be patient and watch till half of it and it's all get better. 
First of all, the story are quite like usual, but also good, and it's getting better time to time, the plot is built meticulously, the ending is tightly consistent.
The main character is very commendable, admirable, he used two hands to create success and rescue loved ones, with the ability and determination, not through timely luck.
Other
                  characters are also very great, they all have special  genitive and story.
The film has a romantic look, has implications, meanings, and a lot more.
The negative point for it maybe the quality, also the confusion and bore in the begining. And the MC was a bit lame at first too.
Even though, Steins;Gate is easily one of the better science fiction anime to appear in the last few years. It has a lot of meanings and plot twist which are very incredible. And the ending are masterpiece, the author sure knows my taste. XD
It's the only anime I found in the recently years that is good at the old ones, and gave me feels for very long time!",9
"
                This is a masterpiece
You get both enjoyable comedy and crippling depression out of it
The show is just amazing in how well it portrays the story
only a little disclaimer: it might be hard to watch for those who aren't a fan of slow world-building or slowburns. BUT when the action starts, you CANNOT take your eyes of it
The story is amazingly well-written even if at first the characters seem one-sided personalities or a typology and imbodiment of a personal trait. The subtile horror and mystery elements are also very confusing at times, not to say that not many may understand (or have the patience to) Okabe
                  and his other persona. It might scare away, but I suggest not to worry, because everything has a reason.
The artstyle and sound are also very well done, especially the ending. MY GOD is that an ending that gives you the feels after certain events in the story.
I honestly cried wacthing this anime and  I bet that many who will start watching it will do too. Overall, this anime is undoubtably belonging to the anime classics. It deserves a masterpiece 10/10 rating.",10
"
                Stein's;Gate was strange. I felt disappointed? I'm not sure how but this series based off of a fairly lengthy visual novel felt like it would have been better suited as a two hour movie. There were a few episodes in the middle that were amazing and I really liked Okabe. Hearing tuturu~ made me smile every time too. As for the bad, anybody who has watched this show knows that the pacing isn't great, so I'll skip out on that.
The biggest problem I had is that it's a deeply stupid show that thinks it's smart. It alludes to science in an offhand manner on occasion
                  to disguise the fact that so much of the time travel doesn't make sense. You can't reference the butterfly effect as a reason to affect something completely distant to the thing that was altered, if you then make it the ONLY thing that changes. You especially can't do that if, for example, changing someone's gender doesn't actually affect that person in ANY way (beyond the obvious physical differences). There's actually a lot that I can suspend my disbelief for and even a lot that I love about how the show handles time travel but the inconsistencies and nonsense (THE ENTIRE CERN PLOT STRAIGHT UP DOESN'T MAKE SENSE) made it difficult to even pay attention at times. The mandatory VN romance hurt the show. The betrayal was badass and showed that not every young woman inexplicably throwing attention at Okabe is necessarily doing so without an ulterior motive; except, as it turns out, she is exactly what she appeared in the first place: a neurotic damaged girl for Okabe to grope at. Epic.
I could go on especially about the last few episodes but I don't want to seem like I hate the show. Maybe it's a love/hate thing. I did cry a couple of times and I can't remember the last time I did that. I wonder if I should play the VN?",7
"
                Please don't waste time reading this review.  Go watch Steins;Gate instead.  You will not regret it.
If you must insist on reading this, I suppose I could talk about why you will enjoy it.
First, for people who like real science fiction, you will enjoy this because it scratches several itches at once:
+ Have you ever dug really hard and deep into something mysterious, and discovered something unsettling?  You feel as if you actually went far enough you would start to see the tiny demons hiding in the seams of the universe?  This anime really strongly provides that feeling, and it's tasty as!
+
                  The adventure and excitement of accidentally inventing something and taking it as far as it will go (and later too far...)
+ Carefully reasoned outcomes, even if the central science fiction themes seem very familiar
+ Clear consequences for actions, instead of silly deus Ex Machina and contrivance.
OK, if you watch anime for Characters and their subsequent development, you need to watch this:
+ The annoying protagonist, he of white lab coat fame, grates on your ears with his melodramatic speech.  But as the story progresses, you see that he does have a serious side and understands the gravity of his meddling with the dark forces of the universe, some of which were perhaps best left alone.
+ The air-headed dark-haired long-time friend isn't just there to provide comedic relief and/or romantic rivalry.  She gets character development, she gets to say some of the show's most pithy lines, and she actually teaches the protagonist about what is important in life.
+ The romantic lead is appealing not for her boob size.  She's not appealing because the writers TELL us why we should be attracted to her.  Instead, she SHOWS us.  She does some of the most amazing things for the protagonist.  At a time when he desperately needs a friend, she's there for him.  She's clever in a way that isn't overwhelming, doesn't cater to the protagonist's BS, is a strong female lead (not just a damsel in distress), kicks ass in her own right, and has some of the most romantic dialog in any anime. (For example, I love the part where she talks about ""My Fork"".  Perfect.)
Why are you still reading this?  Go watch this immediately!  The only negative I can think of:
- You will lose sleep or get fired from your job because you can't stop watching this.  You binge all 24 episodes and forget to eat, or sleep.  Using the toilet becomes a bother to you.  (oops, too far?)",10
"
                For years I have wanted to watch Steins;Gate, and for whatever reason I just never got around to it. It was a hyped up series that I genuinely thought I would enjoy quite a bit, and so I went into it expecting to be blown away. Unfortunately, I think those high expectations ended up detracting from my enjoyment of Steins; Gate.
The show starts off a bit slow, or at least less serious than the way it ends. The first 8 or 9 episodes I kept asking myself when it was going to pick up since it was seeming like more of a slice-of-life/comedy than the
                  incredible series I kept hearing about. Granted, the beginning was not bad, but not what I was expecting and left me wanting more.
Eventually it does start to pick up and go down more of the route I was anticipating when I picked this show up. Most of this portion of the show consisted of undoing the changes the group had made earlier in the show when they discovered they could time travel. This led to seeing Okabe interact with his friends on a somewhat more serious tone and see why they wanted to change the past the way that they did. Most of these ventures ended up being quite sweet, yet sad and I felt they were handled well. While the show starts with showing Okabe as a very eccentric mad-scientist who is a bit caught up his experiments & obviously not the average guy, by the end you also get to see how much he cares for his friends and the lengths he will go to save them.
Overall, I enjoyed Steins; Gate. Most of the characters were quite interesting and it was very satisfying to slowly get to see all of their stories. I did find Mayuri a bit annoying as she sort of filled the generic ditzy, yet sweet friend role. Despite that though, seeing the lengths Okabe would go for her made for some very touching episodes. Other than that and the slow start, I guess I can't necessarily pick out more specific issues I had with the show other than that I just expected...more? I read so much hype for this series that I think my expectations were too unrealistic by the time I actually watched it. I know that's not the most objective way to look at it, but I unfortunately don't have a time machine of my own to correct my expectations.
Regardless, I definitely recommend the series. Just make sure to not put the show on some pedestal like I did, despite all the glowing reviews/ratings as it will only hinder your enjoyment.",7
"
                Definitely a masterpiece, Steins;Gate became my starting point to compare any other anime with (must say, i haven't watched many yet). I just have to write a review about it!
There might be minor spoilers ahead, depending on what you consider a spoiler, but none of them are linked with the story, though.
CHARACTERS
10\10
All main characters felt relevant, interesting and thoroughly developed. Okabe and Kurisu are the best, of course. Side characters appeared to be quite nice and deep too. I will describe them a little bit:
_MAIN
Okabe - fun-yet-kind, ""chaotic-good"" character. Mad scientist! He often says nonsense and makes jokes out of nothing, although on the inside
                  is kind and caring about people around. That's my favourite type of characters and he is executed just exceptionally well.
Kurisu - stubborn, yet curious, cool, yet friendly. ""Tsundere"". Actual scientist! She was a great support for Okabe's team, both in mind and soul.
Mayuri - stupid, yet fun and extremely caring. Mayuri tried her best to brighten mood of everyone around. Often read Okabe's feelings and tried to cheer him up. Also she was the most practical - dealing with food, cleaning and similar chores.
Daru - fat-yet-smart, ""classical otaku"", his simple attitude was actually pretty fun to watch. A powerful support of mad scientist. While Kurisu was great with all that brainy stuff, Daru worked with electronics
_SUPPORTING
Suzuha - what a nice character. Brave, strong, excited by everything... mysterious.
Faris - some sort of copycat (heheh copy cat heheheh) of an Okabe. She was the only one who could talk with mad scientist in his own language! I always felt like her personality stood in the Okabe's shadow. But she is not bad, hell no. All nonsense-generating characters are great!
Luka - to be fair, my least favourite character. Very shy, in other qualities he is similar to Mayuri (silent, caring, practical), but without the ""fun"" part. There is some plot twist happening to him, which i didn't like either.
Moeka - phone weirdo. She is somewhat boring by herself, but her weird actions actually make her look curious. She also has plot twist happening, and this one is kinda... magnificent.
""Mr. Braum"" - TV-fan weirdo. A dude, who was constantly mad at Okabe and friends for shaking the building. Somewhat rough, yet kind inside. Also has quite a plot twist.
Nae - Mr. Braum's chipmunk. She is noice. It's a bit sad that her's plot twist didn't made it to the show (from the novel)
There were some other characters too, but they were mostly minor. Or too spoilery to write about
ART
9\10
Art is nice. It may feel non-spectacular, may feel grayish. But this art makes wanders on the atmosphere of the show. It feels just-about-right dark
SOUND
10\10
I am enjoying Steins Gate OST. It's very atmospheric and well done. Also, music was placed in pretty good spots through the series. I mean, it fits to what's happening on the screen perfectly - sometimes is completely silent, when needed
ATMOSPHERE
10\10
Art, sound, characters, story... Combined together they create astonishing atmosphere. It feels real, in some places it gets pretty dark and cold. This atmosphere thing is probably the main reason i put show at 10 rank in the first place. Out of other shows i have seen probably only ""Deep in abyss"" gets somewhere close in terms of atmosphere. Nothing else was similar.
STORY
10\10
Twisted story with a lot of sudden plot twists coming from characters. It's fantastical yet logical, and while there are plot holes - they are pretty small and i needed to think pretty hard to notice some (...in other words, they are not noticeable through the show. Almost)
...i don't know what i can say without spoilering. It's linked with time, but you already know that, aren't you?
To criticize a bit:
I may note only that story COULD be somewhat wider. Until the last episodes, plot was revolving in somewhat linear way. But anyway it still worth 10\10
ENJOYMENT
0\10
Just joking. Look at the scores in paragraphs higher.
ENJOYMENT HERE CAN BE NO OTHER THEN INFINITY OUTTA TEN, cough
OVERALL
Masterpiece\10
P.S. probably not very original review. But this here is definitely my favourite anime. I can't put 10 to anything other yet. That been said, i haven't seen that much yet
P.P.S. it almost seems i had written this review while being drunk. Hmm",10
"
                Basicly the anime is about time traveling. Cannot really explain more than that without spoiling anything. The anime have more and more growing plots which make the anime much more interesting than the others of its genre. The anime is short and intense. You will find all your answers at the end of it. I liked this anime because of the personality of the characters. They all interact with each others with such concern its so fun to watch. Also the English dubbed version is really nicely done no problem with watching it in english it is really good. Watch this anime you will have
                  a blast. Thanks alot for reading I had fun writing this review, this is my favorite anime I am so excited just writhing about it :D
It happens that this anime also have the best opening of all times ^^

                Hey, mister. I am mad scientist. It so cool! Sonuvabitch. -Okabe Rintarou
MAKISE KURISU<----- MAIN WAIFU <3 <3 <3 
To summarize this story,its a story of a self proclaimed 'Mad Scientist' which is something like an 8th Grade syndrome but hes actually an adult who is also a pretty intelligent person overall.This anime story usually revolves around the main protagonist both Okabe Rintarou and Makise Kurisu messing with the 'Not yet complete time machine' that will work in only if a few requirements were met. But during some of their so-called experiment they made a huge impact and changes in the real world.All of this happens
                  in the 'Future Lab'.
Story: This story is very unique as I believe it havent been done before. It was hard to understand some part of it but the anime explains the story in a very well. The main protagonist Okabe Rintarou is the person the story revolves around as he has a special ability that no one else has. The story unique as it is has a really good plot twist and obstacles which will capture the viewer's heart.
Art: The character design for me is rather unique to a good extent as i have never seen anything like it before. The background is also very well designed and the street and the places was well made.
Character:Throughout the anime,it can be seen that there is a character development throughout the entire series.As the story progress,each character has a realistic feeling of development(Means that the people in the anime develops like a real human rather than an anime character).The feeling of an anime character can be reached to the viewer and the anime is very touching despite the confusion that they are in.
Enjoyment: For me,i totally enjoyed the anime even though the first few wasnt the best and was a bit cringy for me but I would have reacted the same.It was after the episode 5 the anime took the turn for better.From that point onwards,the anime kept on getting better.
Overall:This anime deserves to be one of the must watch anime of all time.Not only because of it unique Story but taking the entire view of the story i can understand why people really like the story.",10
"
                Come on.
The first episode is already cool, and when I watched it for the first time, I didn't find it slow, but when I re-watched it, I did. Trail almost imperceptible, and it keeps you more and more trapped. Okabe develops very well with the rhythm of the story, then it becomes a roller coaster of plots, goes down and down.
It is not a fighting anime, nor battles with robots, just a VERY well developed plot that holds you in each episode.
The characters are not so nice but you ""understand"" them in some way, you keep thinking about what they go through and have already
                  gone through but they don't know, it's very sad",10
"
                   well, i cant express this enough, every single detail is so well made, so well thought ahead. So many details pass without noticing.
   I can start by saying this is the best or one of the best plots I've ever watched, almost every single episode gave me chills while watching, some made me smile ear to ear, some almost made me cry, and some made me laugh my ass off too.
   The way they play with time is already pretty astunning, but the way manage to play with Reading Steiner and it only happening to
                  him is even better, you literally need to stop and think about it some times because is too much to settle in mind.
   Another thing i loved was the way they chose the plot, Mayushii and her perma childish behavior, even in adult age relates with Hououin Kyouma (Okabe's childish side) that was basically created for her.
   On the other hand we have Christina, that represents Okabe's smarter, grown side, even tho he still has some pretty immature attitudes with her xD.
   More than that, something I can't decide if it's something i like or not, it's the fact that he's the only one with Reading Steiner (I'm ignoring their dreams about the other TL's) so basically we are only experiencing what Lhintalou sees, but everybody else forgets it. This is obvius, and it's something that has to happen, otherwise the serie wouldn't make any sense, but still it tilts tf out of me bc i want them to remember the good times, I want them to remember all the funny moments and I feel like I enjoy it more when I know the characteres are enjoying it too, so ye its kinda ""amb√≠guo"" (my favorite word in portuguese go translate if u want idc).
   And yeah that pretty much is it, the last thing i remember enjoying is his evolution, the way he knows what he can or can't do, what he can or can't say, what he can or can't reveal to others so the reality doesn't change.
   Ah, and at last just wanna throw out here that it's pretty original the way they start the time travelling. Like, who tf would think about sending messages to the past instead of going straight to the time machine with actual people inside it? Seems like them, and it was a pretty fkn great idea. well, yeah, it's just perfect idk man. also it's so good that they had so many times where D-mail would be useful but they put a barrier (mayuri) on its usage so it keeps the watcher completely glued to the screen.
   So yeah, this is it, I would say its a masterpiece, wouldn't change many things, it's too good.
   I probably need to rewatch it after some other animes to notice even more details.",10
"
                I never understood all the love for Steins;Gate. Time travel is a very difficult subject to write well. It only really works when you define your rules early, remind the viewer often, and never break said rules. Steins;Gate (SG) does a good job of getting to the time travel relatively quickly, but the rules are very fluid, and seem to change whenever the storyline calls for it. SG feels like your average dramatic thriller anime with an element of time travel, when really it should be the other way around. This leads to story arcs feeling unimportant, characters feeling shallow, and the whole experience being
                  uninteresting. It's a very nice anime to look at, and the V/As do a great job with the characters, but those alone do not make it worth your time. Tuturu is the best part of the anime.",6
"
                This show is awesome. It is very entertaining and enjoyable. You will become very, very attached to the characters. It has an interesting concept on the theory of time travel but what really kept me interested was the dilemma the main character Okabe finds himself in.
Anyways enjoy it if you watch it, the animation is really good, and don't forget about the special episode after you finish the series.
              ",9
"
                The anim√© Steins Gate starts off with self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintaro Okabe attending a lecture by Dr. Nakabachi on the concept of time travel. After the lecture, Okabe outbursts that time travel isn't possible........Until he stumbles across one of his future gadgets inside his house after seeing Kurisu Makise dead in a pool of her own blood, that gadget being dubbed the Phone Microwave. To his amazement, the Phone Microwave has the ability to send messages to the past and alter the flow of history and past events. Much to their amazement, Okabe finds out that his Phone Microwave gadget is actually a time machine.
                  Overjoyed, Okabe abuses the time machine to do random things, such as winning the lottery and changing the past, but little does he know that the consequences of his actions eventually catch up to him as he soon realizes that altering the past and changing the timeline comes with hefty sacrifices. Overall, Steins Gate had an awesome story to it, but the only down side is that it has a really slow, boring start as the plot doesn't make sense until the second half of the anim√©, until you realize the consequences of time travel.",10
"
                Stein:Gate can be really confusing in first few episodes, especially the first episode, but it's very rewarding when you continue to watching it. I personally got some headaches (literally) by just watching up to episode 8. I didn't able to enjoy Stein;Gate at my first time watching it, but after my second time, it became one of my favorite anime of all time. When I watched in on the second time, I already knew what's going to happen but there are still few things that I didn't get at first time that when I got it on second time it's so refreshing. The story is
                  mind-fuck (excuse my language), intelligent, and well written. I couldn't ask for more from the story that it had. The characters are also so well-rounded and funny. Their back stories were all flesh-out. I think I love almost all of the characters. The art and how the scenes were executed were so brilliant. I can nearly feel what the main protagonist feel on some scenes. I think even if you're not into scifi thriller, you will still love it. I'm a type of person who loves slice of life and comedy anime but I still enjoyed this anime.",9
"
                Definitely an anime you should watch if your looking for something good. With that said, i would say it's above average but isn't nearly as good as some people say. The ending was a Deux Ex Machina asspull by the author to force a happy ending. The sin of character development was committed on multiple occassions, making supporting characters make decisions not based on personality but on whats most beneficial to the main character.",7
"
                It can easily be seen at the rate, I loved Steins;Gate. To understand why, I'll quickly introduce myself so you will be able to think if you might as well like this anime. I am studying Astrophysics and enjoy the idea of science-based animes (when they're not bad nor messing with science). The most important to me for an anime is its story and its characters, and I tend to be pretty fond of an anime when it succeeds making me cry.
I will divide this review in two parts, as the whole series is ""timey-wimey"" and can be considered as a single opus :
I -
                  Steins;Gate Season One
II - Steins;Gate anime franchise
I - Steins;Gate
This anime is, as you read, a science-based anime, but has the particularity of showing a quite average main character and a genius side character (first good point) manipulating things they don't really understand, as time travel was fortuitously discovered, thus leading to problems the characters will have to correct.
      Story - 9/10
Steins;Gate Has a pretty basic plot : some guy figures out how to manipulate the past and has to face its consequences. But the side stories bring fresh air throughout the anime and the subplots are always brilliant. The major problem of the story is the narrative (I thought for 3~4 episodes there was a huge plothole because of a misunderstanding due to low explanations) (even if the translation might just have been bad) and a quite slow beginning. Apart from that, the story is near perfect, with right timing and great climaxes, and the end makes sense, which is rare in a series about time-travelling !
P.S. : For those who watched and to help me describe myself more, I'd loved if the anime ended at episode 22.
      Art - 9/10
By ""Art"", I mean both visual pleasure and correspondance between the character's personnalities and theirs looks or place and their meanings, and thus separate this part in two smaller ones, Esthetics and Design.
Esthetics - 4/5
The anime has a pretty low budget (without being insignificant either), so it could have been screwed on the visual aspect, but the animation remains fluid and does not have quality drops. Other good point, either the CGI is rare, either it is amazing, because I rarely recognized it, and it is never pleasurable to see bad CGI  in the middle of an anime. The animation is not perfect and has no particular style (as 3-gatsu no lion or Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, in example), but remains good and stable all over the series, thus deserving a solid 4/5.
Design - 5/5
All characters are really easy to recognize, as each one has a particularity, and match very well with the idea one would get of them just by reading the script. Okabe and Hou√¥in are distinguishable just by their looks and posture due to the expressive style. The lab is just the exact representation of what it should be.
      Sound - 10/10
This part will be separated in Voice acting/sound effects and Music.
Voice acting - 5/5
You were probably told the voice acting was outstanding. Well, I have nothing to add. The sound effects are (of course) not as memorable, but remain good, and amazing in some moments.
Music - 5/5
I studied piano for 10 years, so the auditive aspect, and particularly the music, is really important to me. All I can say about it is ""perfect"". No overstatement here, the openings (especially ""Hacking to the Gate"") are great and correspond perfectly to the anime and the OST is sometimes beautiful as rarely for an OST and remains in the Steins;Gate spirit.
      Characters - 10/10
A real pillar of Steins;Gate ability to carry the viewer emotions is the character panel. The main character, Okabe Rintar√¥, is the self-proclaimed mad scientist Hou√¥in Ky√¥ma who develops a real depht as the anime goes on, surrounded by the ""pervert gentleman"" hacker Hashida Itaru, who discovers himself responsible sides, and Shiina Mayuri, the child-like girl saved by Okabe, who would do anything for her. Then comes Makise Kurisu, the tsundere genius, which, fortunately, has one of the best designs of all, and a group of different characters who all have their own story. No character break or stupid acts are to deplore.
      Enjoyment - 10/10
The most subjective part of the review, where I can say I just loved the anime. It caught me so much I felt empty for one or two days when I ended it. I loved both the behaviour of the characters and the story, carried by the amazing OST and feeling totally linked to the characters' fate.
II - Steins;Gate Anime Franchise
By considering the whole series as a huge one, I got an even better result than by just taking the separate parts, and coherent at a single -and minor- exception about someone mother.
The story is better and has more meaning, uniting both timelines (the original series' end and Zero) and linking elements from the whole timeline,
The art remains equal to itself, discreet but efficient
The sound has a small quality drop in the Music part, in my opinion.
The Characters are just magnified, as it is hard to get them better, and get even more depht (as Mayuri)
The whole thing becomes more enjoyable.
Steins;Gate whole franchise is worth a 10/10, even if some episodes might deserve less, but not enough to lower the general level.
Thank you for reading this long, LONG review, and enjoy your show !",10

                Stein's Gate is truly an anime that deserves the praise it gets. I understand why people might not get hooked at the very beginning, as it seems like your average slice of life silly anime. But, as you continue into it, it becomes so much more interesting with each episode. It's such a gripping story that will always leave on you on the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next. It's so binge-worthy - which, as someone who usually takes a very long time to finish anime, even short ones, I finished this in two days. 
If you haven't watched it yet, please
                  do so. It's just brilliant.",10
"
                If there is one word to describe Steins;Gate, it would definitely be ""intelligent."" The anime will surely make you think a lot about one important factor of life: Fate. But what exactly is fate? A predetermined consequence? Steins;Gate tends to explore this concept while keeping the watcher interested in everything else going on.
Regarding the story, the first 11 to 12 episodes are noticeably uneventful. But that did not bother me much because it was like a introduction showing personalities of each character, and what the ‚ÄúSteins;Gate‚Äù organization is all about. Technically, Steins;Gate does have a slower start than many of well received anime. Nevertheless, I
                  feel like those episodes had to be there or there would be no buildup later on. The plot picked up it itself immensely by halfway through the 24 episode series. Some very ‚Äúedge of your seat‚Äù intensity and emotion throughout. I noticed countless segments of well-crafted drama and tactics, and for great motives like saving the lives of supporting characters.
The anime revolves around the one and only Okabe Rintarou, also by himself known as the scientist ‚ÄúHououin Kyouma!‚Äù He tends to have memories that may or may not have eventually and terminally ‚Äúhappened‚Äù in the time spectrum. I was happy to see such a confident young man in the first 12 episodes, and in the last half of the series, a determined young man who would do anything to save select colleagues in his organization, especially Mayuri, who in my opinion was part of a lot of the anime‚Äôs purpose. Okabe was very well-characterized from start to finish, because we get to see all of his emotions and motives shine throughout all the different parts of the show.
The supporting characters all have their own traits. Mayuri‚Äôs constant greeting of ‚ÄúToo-too-roo‚Äù conveyed her great spirits. Kurisu seems to express a more serious tone. and Itaru is certainly the ‚Äúgeek‚Äù character of the show. There are many more characters, some being a tad bland, but since they are not as crucial to the show as whole, it‚Äôs permissible for that to be the case.
The animation was spectacular (especially on blu-ray), along with a great soundtrack providing extremely good background for the mood of the show.
In terms of enjoyment, I was never once bored while watching this anime. This may be due to personal optimism, thinking of the show being great based on the fan base praising it so well. I would recommend Steins;Gate if you would like an anime that is deep, thoughtful, very well produced, and once again ‚Äúintelligent.‚Äù",9
"
                All of the plot is predictable, lacking fanservice and very annoying at the end of the anime when an iteration occurs on the plot it seems clich√©d and makes our emotional responses feel flat, the animation is even worse than the drama Koe no Katachi which tends to drama and narrative stories, even though the anime  is lacking the action scene. I just like the characterization of the anime, Some of characters are quite satisfying.
I can only equate this anime with watching my childhood like cartoon Upin Ipin from Malaysa, the plot  is really mainstream and flat, quickly makes the desire to watch
                  me go out, basically this anime is too overrated to be good",1
"
                First of all let me say that this anime is rated so highly on this website for a good reason! I truly think that this anime is a masterpiece, and here is why!
Story: 10
This is, in my opinion, one of the most consistent time travel stories that I've ever seen. How does one write a time travel story without having any plot holes, without being confusing, and overall entertaining and creative? Well, I personally wouldn't know where to begin, but Steins;Gate took a very creative approach. The authors based the story off of a real person who called themselves ""John Titor"" and claimed to be
                  a time traveler from the year 2036. He posted on several forums about his time traveling experiences, and they were actually pretty convincing, or, at the very least, very thought out and clever. So the concept of time travel in Steins;Gate is based on ""world lines"" and hoping from one to the next. It'll walk you through it in a way that you'll understand. Don't worry. If you aren't a very scientific person, however, it may prove to be quite confusing! Also, side note, a lot of people find the anime hard to get into. I didn't, but things will start to get REALLY serious only halfway through, so just keep that in mind!
Art: 10
I give the art a 10. It is very pretty to look at, the style is quite nice, and the character designs are great! I really don't have much to say about the art, except the eyes looked a bit strange at first until I got used to them. There's a ring in the iris that looked a bit strange, but eventually liked them quite a lot. Oh, and the art in the opening, especially at the beginning, is so quirky and badass.
Sound: 10
The opening is phenomenal, and so is the outro. The soundtrack is overall a really nice addition to the anime. There is also something that a lot of anime don't do. They often have an ambient sound of cicadas or some insect in the background that sounds really pretty, and never get annoying. A lot of the OST sounds very sci-fi, so it fits the theme of the show very nicely. Also, the dub sounds really nice, and the sub sounds good, too!
Character: 10
This is probably the best aspect of this anime. The characters are very lovable, and are also really funny. There will be moments that will (probably) make you cry or at least want to cry, because you really feel bad for a lot of things that happen to them. Rintarou Okabe, the main character, is definitely one of my favorite anime characters. He's an 18 year old mad scientist, who does a lot of quirky things and has created his own terms for different things that are actually quite meaningless! For example, ""Steins Gate"" and ""El Psy Congroo!"" You'll love how quirky the guy is, and a lot of things he does will really touch you. He also even has his own ""hostage."" Seriously, you'll love the guy, but I could go on and on about how good the other characters are! You just have to watch it to understand. I also love how there isn't really many villains, but the few there are are great! In addition, the plot even serves as a villain in a way!
Enjoyment: 10
Of course, with a 10 in all of the other categories, I have to give the enjoyment factor a 10 as well. Because I really did absolutely love it. I kept waiting for the next episode, and the next, wondering what was going to happen. There are quite a bit of cliff hangers that makes the anime even more addictive. There's a reason why this anime is on my top 10 list. My advice would be just to watch the show without expecting too much in terms of seriousness. And when the serious stuff does happen, you'll be caught off guard, and that's good.
Overall: 10
This show is an emotional rollercoaster. Now, it isn't going to invoke the same feelings as an anime like Feelsmetal Alchemist Brotherhood or anything, but it will definitely hit you in the feels. You will also find yourself laughing your ass off at a lot of the jokes, because they really are funny. There are a lot of adult jokes in the show, which also shows that this is an anime more for mature audiences. Overall, make this anime a priority to watch. Because again, this is a big name anime that a lot of people know about. And again, all for a good reason. I wish I could turn back time and watch it again for the first time...",10
"
                The writing involved with this series has gone as far as translating what they could find of john titors posts from back when(or finding already trans versions), combined with pictures of his ""time machine"" to give a little ground to partial of the story. There's also obvious watered research of the topics at hand which you would have to give credit to.
I've always thought of this story as impressive for many reasons, but the end result of the production of this story; The art, voice actors, story, directing, everything could not of been better, especially for this time.I looooove the opening as well.
Bless everyone who
                  worked on this. It's truly not just one of the best anime of all time, it's literally one of the best shows to ever exist on any platform of ""tv show"".",10
"
                This is a Review out of 100. 35/100 for Story, 35/100 for Characters, 15/100 for Sound, 15/100 for Animation. I'll also take the OVA into account. 
Story - 31/35 - The story of Steins;Gate is a little confusing at times and does take a while to really get going. The first 11 episode are essentially buildup for the roller coaster ride you will go on in the last half. The good thing about the first half, is that it is pretty enjoyable in its own right. Particularly because it is very funny, so long as you get the jokes. Some of the jokes are universal,
                  like the sexual innuendos, but some require some internet and otaku knowledge. But the second half is where things get serious. Like Butterfly Effect serious. Thats when the story picks up into full gear and things that didn't seem of much importance get brought up again and become plot devices. A truly amazing plot. I also have to mention the romance in this show, which was very good IMO. In fact, that couple is one of my favorite anime couples because of how well they compliment each other. The only thing stopping this show from getting a perfect score is the fact that the first half isn't amazing (compared to the latter half) and it follows a very visual novel kind of format, which can get a tad boring in the first half. I will give props to the OVA episode, as I felt it gave a better ending and answered some questions that the ""real"" ending left open.
Characters - 33/35 - This is a very memorable cast of characters. You have the mad scientist Okabe, who is one of my favorite characters ever, his lovely assistant Kurisu, who compliments him very well, the always lovable Mayuri, and the Hacker/Otaku Daru. However, there are many other important characters, like Suzuha, Ruka, Faris, and Moeka. Overall I really like this cast a lot, as each one of them is funny in their own way and have their own little quirks. Each one also gets their fair share of development, especially Okabe. I can spend all day talking about the characters and it wouldn't do them justice, you have to watch them.  
While some people hate on the dub, I personally liked it, although I will admit it is inferior to the sub voices for the most part. I say try it dubbed, and if you like it, stick with it. 
Sound -14/15 The music in this show was just great. I really loved it. The opening and ending songs were some of the best I have heard, and I like that they didn't change halfway through like other shows. The rest of the music in the show was pretty memorable in it's own right. Nice and clam during the slice of life parts and suspenseful during the dramatic parts. Truly beautiful. 
Animation - 13/15 - The show is nicely animated, and is very fluid. The colors are dull, but seem to fit the atmosphere better that way. The character designs are from the visual novel, but each character has a distinctive look to them. 
Overall - 91/100 - One of my favorite series ever, and with good reason. A great cast of characters and an amazing plot (that isn't without its flaws though). I can't think of a way to improve this show, because it is just that good already.",9

                THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST 12 EPISODES 
TW FOR TRANSPHOBIA AND SA
Have not read the source material. 
Ok, I‚Äôll be honest, I couldn‚Äôt sit through the whole thing. The amount of discomfort I experienced watching this show was mad. I know there‚Äôs a lot of wayyyy more dodgy stuff out there and frankly, should look up warnings on every show as a routine thing before watching, but this anime was so hyped and widely seen as good, I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be that bad !! But man, was I wrong. AND there wasn‚Äôt even a redeeming plot line that made me want to
                  continue watching, or to know what happens next, and I went into this pretty open-mindedly. 
Now to get into detail about everything I disliked about this show:
Ok, biggest criticism I‚Äôve seen out there so I‚Äôm gonna get that one over with first. Surely by the 10th episode, you should have an idea about the plot, right? Well apparently not for this anime. Not only does it have the most generic and obvious time-travel mechanics, but it‚Äôs unnecessarily complicated and nobody in the show even considers it!! They talk about the butterfly effect like what, 9 episodes in? And they‚Äôve already time traveled at this point! Get a grip, get a plot!!!
What‚Äôs more, I don‚Äôt care for the mc at ALL. He‚Äôs a completely unlikeable guy - and this is probably intentional bc I‚Äôm told he gets development and redemption and all that. But do I care about him enough to want to see this redemption ???  Nope. 
Side characters ?? Might as well be cardboard cutouts. They‚Äôre so tropey with nothing beyond that - I don‚Äôt mind tropes if there is MORE to the character ! But there‚Äôs nothing !! There‚Äôs the perv guy, cute innocent girl, hot girl who doesn‚Äôt talk and has no critical reasoning or personality or thoughts of her own, the tsundere whose only personality is getting a bit mad, the ‚Äútrap‚Äù character who is just thinly veiled transphobia, the maid cat girl who says nya al the mf time. Frankly, it‚Äôs boring. 
And I have no idea what the motivations of any of the characters are. 10 eps in. 
Ok, now to address why I put TWs bc imma talk about why this show made me so uncomfortable. 
First, you have the sexual assault and harassment. Perv guy is only there to make unsolicited comments about EVERY woman in the show. Is this supposed to be funny? If so, it falls flat. And like, it‚Äôs multiple times every episode - felt like 70% of the dialogue. Not funny, get a better joke, stop being creepy and rapey. 
The transphobia is what made me sick. I‚Äôm trans myself, so it hit home a bit. There‚Äôs a character (whose name I forgot and don‚Äôt care to remember) who is your typical ‚Äútrap‚Äù - young person who is introduced as a girl, only for you to find out - OMG ITS A BOY ???? This is made into an overdone and again, unfunny joke throughout. But I thought this was just your typical ‚Äútrap‚Äù - there are some even in shows that I do like, and while I hate the trope (not getting into how fundamentally horrific a trope it is), sometimes it doesn‚Äôt ruin the show for me. That would be, if them being a ‚Äútrap‚Äù wasn‚Äôt CRUCIAL TO PARTS OF THE PLOT?? 
So, this character wants to send a message back in time after hearing about the main group‚Äôs time machine. This character wants to do this because she wishes she had been born a girl. This is met with shock value (is it supposed to be funny ??? Idk) and OMG NO UR A BOYY and IS IT REALLY OK TO CHANGE SOMEONES GENDER ?? 
But, they do it ! But mc thinks it doesn‚Äôt work. Later finds out it did work!! Here‚Äôs how:
He‚Äôs changed timelines or whatever. Still thinks ‚Äútrap‚Äù character is a dude, and says it in conversation. Everyone else gets annoyed, but this is bc in this timeline, this character was born a girl, so their attempt to change the past for her worked. Mc doesn‚Äôt believe it, and KEEPS INSISTING SHES A DUDE. THEN GROPES HER. IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY ??? 
Overall, her gender is a cheap joke for transphobes and pissy babies to find funny. Grow up. 
There‚Äôs more to this, but I haven‚Äôt got that far and only read it from the Netflix episode description. So take this with a grain of salt. MAJOR SPOILERS FROM NOW ON! 
The cutesy innocent girl side character apparently dies bc of them fucking with the past right, so mc tries to convince ‚Äútrap‚Äù girl into reversing their alteration of the past and make her ‚Äúback‚Äù into a dude. Doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. Why is transition a plot device ? Why does it have to be reversed in a way that puts this in a negative light ? If u don‚Äôt have the critical reasoning to realise why this is really weird and pretty damaging considering the amount of ppl that have watched and liked this show, idk what to tell u. Could‚Äôve literally written any plot, and not only is it bad but it‚Äôs also extremely transphobic! Well done. 
There‚Äôs more that I didn‚Äôt like, such as the mediocre art style and animation. Voice acting and sound isn‚Äôt something I can rlly comment on idk anything about that. I will say that the OP bangs tho and will remain in my playlist it slapssss. 
Yeah that‚Äôs it. Still, try out the show for urself if u like EXTREMELY slow burns and can put up with an HORRENDUS amount of discomfort. (If it doesn‚Äôt make u uncomfortable, sorry but.  What. )
Seriously, if u still wanna watch it go for it. For those that like time travel stuff it might be good bc frankly I didn‚Äôt finish it and don‚Äôt want to.",2

                1) Breaking Bad
2) Game of Thrones
3) Steins;Gate
These are, without exaggeration, the three best tv series I've ever seen, or am ever likely to see.
What makes Steins;Gate practically flawless? First off, the animation and artwork are practically identical to the visual novel. That is to say, both are fantastic.
The story is truly one of anime's most accomplished, not only rivalling but exceeding the achievements of pretty much every time travel story ever told.
Then there are the characters. In the days of the so-called 3-episode rule, the slow pacing of the series' first half could lose it plenty of viewers. Steins;Gate is a series which should be
                  persevered with, as the abundance of character development and the slowly developing plot both demand your attention. The main cast of characters are well written, having entertaining traits.
Steins;Gate is a series that only comes around maybe once in a decade, possibly even once in a lifetime.",10
"
                Acho que uma das unicass  reviews em portugues de Steins;Gate. e a review TEM SPOILER, ent√£o se voce n√£o viu Steins;Gate, repense sua vida e veja.
 Acho que Steins;Gate √© um dos melhores animes que eu ja vi na minha vida! Tudo funciona direrito, o anime tem muitos poucos defeitos. (mas isso eu falo...quer dizer escrevo mais pro final)
  Gosto do jeito que o anime √© complexo, de como a historia √© toda planejada e as coisas se encaixam perfeitamente. Por Exemplo, no primeiro episodio o Okabe encontra a Kurisu morta, isso na primeira linha do tempo, e mais pra frente quando 
                  o Okabe esta desfazendo os D-mails  ele se lembra da linha do tempo original, onde a kurisu morre, e isso faz ele n√£o querer desfazer os D-mails. Pra voc√™ ver como o anime pega algo do primeiro episodio que pra muitos n√£o tem tanta importancia eultiliza no final!
 Os personagens s√£o bem construidos, voc√™ se apega a cada um, voce consegue gostar de todos.
 Agora os defeitos, que s√£o bem poucos:
 A falta de trilhas sonoras marcantes
 O fato dos personagens usarem sempre as mesmas roupas (n√£o sei se isso pode ser
considerado um defeito mas Wharever)",10
"
                ""I'm the great mad scientist, Hououin Kyoma!""
 I laught every time Okabe says that.
This is a story of a guy that really makes the world his one fantasy and people go along with it. From organizations working in the shadow, talking to the phone all by himself like nobody knows or just creating storys out of nowhere and he¬¥s just so damm funny, really for me is the funniest caracter i ever seen in an anime, so silly but creative at the same time.
So talking about the story it starts very slowly, it¬¥s a slow progress but the thing is that i didn¬¥t mind. The
                  caracters are so carismatic and enjoyable and their relacionships are so well constructed that i was glad that the progression was made that way, in a time where every thing is fast, everything is done in a hurry up status, steins/gate takes the time for you to care about the caracters in the story and really apreciate their relations with each other. And for me this is the primary point for steins/gate success, BECAUSE YOU CARE, you really care about them and that makes everything greater, every plot twist more suprising and every tragedy more sad and dramatic. It¬¥s difficult to make an anime starting slow but engaging people in a away people that they can¬¥t stop watching even with low progress and this series does that in a brilliant way.
Story 9/10
The theme of the show is time travel a theme that i don¬¥t enjoy that much because usualy writers or director stend to over complexify and they start to lose the story, but steins/gate does a wonderful job at handling that, everything is explained in a simple and not exaustive way, they explain when they have to and no more. In the first episodes after he saves Christina (i like to call her that way) i was kind of worried where the story could go because i didn¬¥t wanted to be like they go back to the past and save the world or something basic like that. Instead of that Okarin (Okabe)  changes somethings by sending messages to the past and only him can remember how the world was before he send the texts. That was an unique approach that make me really happy
And of course without telling any spoiler in the middle of the show some big thing happens because of that changes and Okabe has to reverse them to go back to normal. The thing is that he needs to reverse a thing that i really didn¬¥t remember he had change and it was just a mindblower. I was watching and thinking oh no poor guy. And he¬¥s my guy so i was really sad.
Art 8/10
The art is nothing special really, it¬¥s simple and done well enought, it¬¥s not some space travel story with over the top effects and spaceships and i¬¥m glad it isn¬¥t.
Sound 8/10
It has good music for the moments of more dramatic effects, don¬¥t like the entry music. 
Character 10/10
The best part of the show. The main characte is carismatic, funny, cares about people and shows a serious side because of the thing that happen to him that is really good to see, he¬¥s a very positive and cofident guy but he turns sad because of things that happen and that¬¥s nice to see he is human, he thinks to give up and make a mess out of thing and doesn¬¥t know how to act in certain places or moments. He became one of my favorite characters in just a few episodes so just for him this anime is worth watching. The supporting roles are awesome too, Mayuri is the absolutely sweetest thing ever tuturu!! and she¬¥s sweet whithout being annoying or force, she¬¥s just sweet i love her. Christina is a really great partner to Okabe she¬¥s smart and funny even if she doesn¬¥t want to be because she is a genius and trys to be a very serious person. I just don¬¥t like moebe.
Enjoyment 10/10
Just watch it is great really!!!!!!",9
"
                I loved steins gate so much and as it had so much to it and 5pb nitro plus, whitefox really did do a good number on it and made it have so much potential with the character development of miyu, Okabe rintarou and many of the other characters that adapted later on :) Okabe really does attempt as well as they start with putting bananas in microwaves to expanding the measure of warp holes to different time lines and then to tracking down the organisation that also track him down because they know hes hacking into SERN. Then suddenly shit went down after that but
                  the story gets really exciting as it progresses and I'm so happy I got to watch it now and now own it on DVD I JUST LOVED THE TIME MACHINE EXPERIENCE ^_^ loved the opening theme and the ending to steins gate also and the animation is outstanding",10
"
                Some contextualization: A week ago, I started looking for an anime to watch in order to pass the time while house-sitting at my cousin's. I came upon RAVE, RAVE reviews for Steins;Gate an anime which did, in truth, seem interesting but didn't seem to fall into my usual genres for watching. Anyways I decided to give it a shot. 24 episodes later, if I had a chance to send a ""d-mail"" to my past-self, it would read: ""you MUST watch Steins;Gate"".
- Story
The plot (if you haven't heard -_-) involves time travel. Although I have not viewed other animes concerning time, I must say that I
                  feel Steins;Gate does it very well. The anime is complex and thought invoking but, at the same time, not complicated or contradictory. You may need to re-watch certain parts but the story does a great job of being subtle, yet explanatory. 
The pacing is rather slow for the first 10 episodes or so. I think this is rather intentional though as they are laying the groundwork for the plot's twists and turns later in the story. The anime takes place over a time-span of a few weeks so it's vital that you understand what happens in the various time lines and what they with these time lines later in the story. The final 14 episodes FLY BY. I wish they would have lasted longer but I guess such is the tragedy of relativity.
- Art
The art was very pretty but nothing too unusual if you frequently watch anime. That being said, I don't care too much about ""experimental"" styles so I was glad that the artists stayed away from excessive CGs and the like. The story is very character focused, so most of the art is dedicated to them; you don't see much landscape art. However, this focus really shows in the way the people look in the anime. Something I noticed while watching was that the colors in the anime appear to be washed out and kind of have a gray shade to them which I feel fits the tone of the story very well. Steins;Gate's animation isn't anything too vanguard but the artists stick to a very good formula.
- Sound
The music is very good. They did a great job matching songs to fit the mood and I felt that their musical choices enhanced the tones and moods that they wanted the viewer to feel. The poignant moments did, in fact, seem poignant. Same goes with the light-hearted and comedic scenes. Also, I loved the OP!
- Characters
Very well done. The leads (Kurisu and Okabe) are complex characters and I feel they didn't belong too strongly in stereotypical categories. Their personalities complement each other well and as the series progresses, it is the evolution of their relationship that really drives the final chapters of the story. I found it interesting to see Okabe changes and develops as a character as the series goes on (he's the only one who can ""develop"" of course)
The supporting characters were also very deep even though there were quite a few of them. Each had their own story and personalities which I felt the anime did a great job of portraying. For an anime that only has 24 episodes, I was surprised at how strong a connection I formed with some of the characters (although that could possible be due to my fanboyism :P). 
- Overall and Enjoyment
All-in-all there is a lot to like about Steins;Gate and although people in reviews might tell you about how awesome it is, you can't really experience the epicness until you watch it yourself. There were points in the anime where REAL-LIFE stuff seemed to take on greater significance, though this may have to do with watching it at 3AM. Refreshing story, great art and music choice, and lovable characters. What more can you ask for?",10
"
                To be fair you need at least a 300iq to understand Steins:Gate. Memes aside I have always had a soft spot for time travel stories and this one delivers with amazing character writing. The beginning is a little slow and tedious to get to (hence the 9/10 and not 10/10) but once it gets its wheels spinning it does not stop and it does not care for how the show makes you feel. In a story where time looping is the primary mechanic for how the story moves forward it can definitely lose some people along the way simply due to trying to keep all
                  the facts straight. I didn't really feel that for the most part. There were a few moments were I got lost in the story but not enough for me to consider the story unwieldy. This is a show that's considered by some to be a classic or an icon of modern anime and I 100% agree. An interesting and unique story great characters and enough feels to go around.",9
"
                This anime was quite interesting to me. I started watching it when I found out how popular it was. When I first started, I didn't understand why it was rated so well but I continued watching and wow. Im glad I didn't stop watching. Although you have to get to around episode 6 to start getting into it, I think it pays off so much. The action and build up is simply so unique that it makes it seem like a masterpiece. When you find out how everything you watched has created this entirely new world, you just get WOWED. Speechless. Will remember this anime.
                  Dont stop watching until you're done!",9
"
                This is my first time writing and actually deciding to write a review to an anime I watched. So if there are any errors or rules I violated, please inform me and I will delete this work. In short, my initial feeling about Steins Gate was: Wait what? Another sci-fi time-traveling anime? And by watching this whole series, it proved me wrong. It isn't anything at all boring and lack of innovation, besides all of the realistic theories posted in the anime, it really taught me the lesson that time is precious and you can only live it once. In fact, with the combination of
                  intrigue BGM and a very cool, almost too shinny for me to watch, OP. One thing I recommend for new-watchers is that: please, if you feel boring at some point, keep on going and at least finish the whole series.
When I was first recommended with this anime, by my sister, I was told that the first couple of episodes could be boring and flat. However, I was actually fascinated and watched the whole series at one try, the final twist really surprises me and actually made me re-watch the first episode again. As for what the twists are, I will leave that to you to discover, probably some of you already know. Anyway, the music was great, not only its rhythm but it foreshadows and actually matches the plot, which definitely indicates that the anime company had put tremendous effort into making.
For characters, I believe that the author builds and shapes them well enough to be realistic but at the same time interesting to watch. Interestingly, the protagonists aren't drawn to be appealing like some of the animes, but the author clearly made their behavior ""appealing"" and very heart-stirring. To people who finished this anime already, I am sure some of you remembered Kyoma's final speech before he set off with john Titor back to where everything started. The ambitious BGM, with great cross-cutting, it did the ""show but not tell"" to the best I saw. I am sure that there are person in the forum who could do a deep analysis with the techniques the author uses in creating different parts, but that would go too academic. 
Anyway, I really like this anime, though I always told my sister obstinately, that I hated from the first second. I definitely recommend this anime to everyone who loves ratiocination and high IQ animes.",9

                Do not regret and complain about the past, because the choices we choose today are the destiny of our lives. Life will go on and be coupled with problems, until the end of our life. For that, don't ever complain about what happened in the past, because in fact this life is the best life that God has given us.
I liked this anime because, this anime changed my mind about the time machine and new sci-fi plot story for me. So it was refresh my mind about movie or anime with sci-fi genre.
A masterpiece anime and i will remember tuturu...

                On the surface Steins Gate seems like it lacks any originality. It borrows heavily from western media such as back to the future and Groundhog Day. However that only scratches the surface of what this anime has to offer. 
The story follows Rintarou Okabe, a Self proclaimed ‚Äòmad scientist‚Äô, as he discovers the secrets to send messages back to the past. Rintarou is a fantastic protagonist, he‚Äôs jolly, eccentric and cares deeply for his friends. But often struggles to communicate and can come of as stubborn. The rest of the cast are perfect too. Kurisu is the intellectual rival who seeks relationships with others. Mayuri
                  is a sweet girl who you want to protect at all costs. Itaru is the hacker best friend who has a heart of gold, and too many pervy thoughts. And many more. No character is wasted or underused. 
It‚Äôs hard to speak about this show without spoilers, but I shall do my best. The show is split into two half‚Äôs. The first is the introduction part. We follow the characters as the build this machine and grant wishes to all their friends for better or worse. A truly genius move as it gives us time to get to know these people. And why they choose to change aspects of their life. Halfway through the season however the anime throws a massive curveball. Everything gets changed and suddenly the whole premise is switched on its head. As Okabe desperately tries to save the past, present and future, he soon comes to realise that when you mess with time, not everyone wins. 
Steins Gate is almost flawless in its execution. Whenever time travel is involved in media one of two things occur. Time travel is either can be used to fix a mistake, such as Avengers Endgame. Or is used to show the consequences of messing with fate, such as back to the future. Steins Gate is different however. Time Travel isn‚Äôt presented as inherently a good or evil thing. It‚Äôs simply a tool. At the end of the day it‚Äôs the person who travels through that is good or evil. It‚Äôs a refreshing look at a plot device that has gotten stale over the years. 
Steins Gate is a fresh look at a genre that has become quite stale over the years. It does it‚Äôs job perfectly at will be remembered as a true great, whatever timeline we‚Äôre in.",10

                Unlike most animes for its time, this one requires a little bit of patience. The first few episodes of the series is a bit dull, in which the characters are mainly having a conversation and everything is to set up for something later on which you won't be aware of. When something does start to happen, everything soon falls into place and then it gets more exciting and while the situation gets more dire. At that point, I could not stop watching it.
Some would say the series is a psychological piece, but honestly after having watch it with immense concentration after episode 5, I would
                  say it is more closer to a slice and life/romance series. The characters are mainly stuck in one place yet they seem to be going through some sort of mission, in which their environment is constantly changing even though they are not aware of it. Here you see some character development, in which some who you believe are lazy, perverted, perhaps even crazy do something fundamentally different in order to preserve another aspect of themselves.
One of the few time traveling shows that I have read. While its theories are a bit clunky, it was actually able to make it interesting while having good storytelling. Anyone with patience is recommended to watch it.",9
"
                Ahhh what can I say about Steins;Gate? Although I literally just finished it after drying up some tears (yeah, I'm a crier!), I can whole-heartedly say that this was one of my, if not, FAVORITE anime of all time. The storyline focuses on the idea of time-traveling and, although the topic at hand is fascinating, this anime handles it on a more emotional level. Steins;Gate displays the consequences and risks of what it means to travel in time: disappearance of memories, a person never meeting the other, events are re-written... and sometimes even fully changed. The show truly grasps the many emotional conflicts that can
                  arise when one is given the choice to travel in time and change the past.
 Even though the show is primarily a science fiction anime, there are many genres that can apply to Steins;Gate: slice of life, tragedy, suspense/thriller, romance... it's an anime that appeals to anyone's personal tastes! Although, if you don't like insane plot twists, having your heart shattered into a thousand pieces, and having your mind confused, well...this isn't the right anime for you.  The characters are very well-developed and well-liked, and their motives are clear and relatable. During my viewing of this anime, I haven't come across a single character I didn't like, which is SUPER rare. 
All in all, I really enjoyed watching this anime, no matter how many times I've cried. It's a very memorable anime and I think people should DEFINITELY put it in their watch lists if they haven't already!",10

                STEINS GATE: The story really takes a lot of time to take off, but once it does, you‚Äôre in for a ride
This whole concept of time travel is rather a clich√© nowadays, so some viewers might find Steins Gate‚Äôs premise to be unoriginal. But there is a big difference between the ordinary time travel story and Steins Gate. This series has utilized a number of scientific theories to create a solid foundation of its time travel concept. This means that Steins Gate follows a set of rules and technicalities in its time travelling; it‚Äôs not just about simply going back to the past. Personally, I
                  really enjoy stories that are bound by rules, for this trait prevents the exploitation of deus ex machina. Aside from that, it triggers the viewers to utilize their brains on coming up with strategies that exploit the rules.
However, Steins Gate‚Äôs overload of rules also has a negative effect. It makes the story so hard to establish, because there are just too many things to explain. This becomes very evident in the first half of the series, which is dedicated to the various experiments of the group of friends, so the viewers could understand the rules and technicalities of time travel. What makes the first half even more problematic is its lack of a major conflict. Sure, there are immediate conflicts here and there, but they are not solid enough to sustain the interest of the viewers. Their conclusions aren‚Äôt even gratifying, for they seem to be too simple as conflicts in the first place. However, this portion is not all bad. The seemingly random experiments turn out to be not random at all. They are not just included to the series to present the rules and technicalities of time travel, for they are actually legitimate plot points that affect the second half of the story.
Speaking of the second half of the story, this is the part where the real fun begins. This portion is where the rules and technicalities of time travel shine so much that they make the information overloading of the first half worth it. The series also starts to employ a darker tone, as the characters are drawn to the effects of their experiments. By the end of this portion, the viewers will realize that all the plot points of the series fit together. This just shows that Steins Gate is a very planned-out story.
However, the characterization is a different case. The only fleshed-out character of the series is Okabe Rintaro, the main protagonist. I‚Äôm not saying that the other characters are paper cut-outs. The problem I have with them is that they are not given much focus in the story. The story is just so plot-oriented that the viewers couldn‚Äôt even get to know the characters aside from Okabe Rintaro. These characters actually have very distinct personalities and leave an impression, meaning that they have the potential to be great characters. It is just too bad that they don‚Äôt enjoy much screen time to fully show their worth.
As for its animation and music, they are not really groundbreaking, and I can‚Äôt even remember a particular scene or soundtrack that stood out in their own department. However, the entertainment value of Steins Gate does not rely on these technicalities. It is in its story.
Overall, Steins Gate is a series that I would highly recommend to both anime enthusiast and not. The concept it portrays, no matter how clich√© it seems to be, is actually very original because of the way it has been executed. But I must admit that it could have been more gripping if the first half has been a lot more solid.",9

                I need to explain why I gave a 8 to this anime that everyone claim as the ""perfect anime""
1- The episode one:The first episode was so chaotic and lot of things happening at once, the first episode should be two episodes to we can take all the information and it should explain a bit better than it did, due this chaotic episode one I almost dropped the anime and with this I never could give a 10 to the anime because a 10 to me means perfection, and starting with this big mistake that can't be justified it already makes me a good reason to
                  not give a 10 but i would still give a 9 if there wasn't the second reason.
2- Some unnecessary parts and a quick end?: The anime have lot's of unnecessary parts, enough to I think that the anime should have only 20 episodes, the one that most bothered me was when okabe thought about who sacrifice kurisu or mayuri, like it's ridiculous that he passed 2 episodes to this, it could have been done in a single episode.
The end is so quick that we can't even have time to think on ""wow it is ending"" it's more like ""will it end like this quick?"" the anime wasn't quick but the end was so quick, it should be a 2 episodes ending with one being a part of the plan and some of the execution and the other episode would be the conclusion.
The problem of this anime is that doesn't knows what should have long and quick parts
That's why my rate is 8
The characters all have a annoying thing of them but this annoying thing at almost all characters are them hiding their emotions (Mayuri weirdly happy all the time, Itaru being a pervert with almost every girl, kurisu looks really egocentric at lot of times, suzuha is so agitated and expressive) but all those things have their reasons that you need to look deeper on the characters to notice it.
The music is beautiful
The ambient makes you feel like you are always on risk
The anime is really good but it have too many errors to be perfect to me
It was a good experience anyway",8
"
                I don't take that anyone who didn't consciously jump between timelines will find much relevance in my post, but still...
Although the anime doesn't go much into the details, it touches very important aspects involved with interdenominational travel. Like for instance the fact that the neither future nor past are set in stone, and every time you make a shift, both are being affected... and even more so is the personality construct. There is no mistake in saying that whoever is behind this anime has experienced it themselves in some manner. Still it took me by a surprise Happy travels everyone!",10

Steins;Gate is an emotional rollercoaster that explores time travel and the universe in a way that grips you despite having so much scientific depth. It involves so much thought provoking statements and concepts and has become somewhat of a core within my personal philosophy.
I have to say, this anime did everything right for me. Probably if not the greatest pick for the general category of anime i have watched, then greatest of all time.
As much as I love to complain,
                  I couldn't find anything to complain about for this one.
A lot of people complain about the pacing, but personally I didn't feel the pacing was off at all. It was so enthralling in fact that I watched it all in 1 midnight. Probably one of the best spent midnights of all time.
This anime is what eventually spiraled my interest into Physics as a whole. The concept of Many worlds interpretations or different concepts as to how time travel works, the world lines and attractor fields that coverge at certain points, or how mini black holes are related to time travel, S/CERN the organization and our mystery man: John Titor. I found it all so interesting and deep.
The story was not difficult to follow yet incredibly intricate and unpredictable. I often felt my body tense up and on the edge of my seat. The words suspense and tension are not able to describe the vast array of physical sensations pulsing through my body as the story carried on.
The refreshing contrasts between the characters personalities when put in different situations really makes them feel human and easy to invest in. I especially enjoyed the development between Okabe and Kurisu, with Kurisu being one of if not my favourite character of all time.
If watched in a time when I could cry I'm certain I would have cried out of sheer bursting emotion, speaks to how much this anime moves me.
The art was great, often having unconventional but fitting angles or purposeful lighting and setting. The sound design just adds to it all, creating incredibly tense moments or goofy calmness, a deep sadness or even a bittersweet happiness.
I can't convey in words how much I love this anime 10/10.",10
"
                This is my 4th favorite anime of all time since I love time-traveling stuff, huge-ass mind fucks and amazing plot twists. Everything in this anime is just marvelous‚Ä¶the art-style, the ost, the characters, everything. The plot is amazingly well done and the characters are highly developed during the whole thing. Why did I give it a 9,5 instead of a 10? Well... SPOILER ALERT, Okarin kinda fucked up in the end, because he took the metal thingy, so the new Okabe won't even know it existed next time.
I HIGHLY recommend this anime to EVERYONE... If you can make it throughout the first part of the
                  anime until you reach the first huge plot twist, I promise you will LOVE this anime.",10
"
                This is possibly one of the worst anime I have ever seen. It is just completely awful. I do not understand what people see in this, the scores absolutely blow my mind. I have tried watching this 3 times, the first 2 times I never made it past the second episode. The third time I forced myself to watch through episode 14, hoping it would get better and deliver on what all these wonderful reviews promise, but no. I found myself screaming at it halfway through because it just kept getting more scattered and further and further away from a coherent plot. Most of the
                  time I am expecting one of the characters to wake up and realize it was all a bad dream, or some other cliche. 
The main character, Okabe, is completely schizophrenic for no reason other than to supposedly add dimension to the character, but it just ends up grating on your nerves. The character is a sheer nutcase, and it is not even remotely endearing like the almost exact same character Issac from Baccano!.  I love John Michael Tatum's voice work in almost everything I have heard him in, especially Spice and Wolf, but but even he could not save this one. (and yes, I realize he also played Issac in Baccano!). I just can't put into words how much this character turned me off. 
Mayuri feels like a lift of Edward from Cowboy Bebop. You can't help find her somewhat endearing, but she is so unoriginal that you can't get past it. 
The rest of the characters are plain, vanilla anime tropes. I am so worn out right now from trying to get through the show that I don't even want to continue this review.
In summary, yes I know some people like things that other's don't. I am not slamming anyone for giving positive reviews to the show, I love some anime that have mostly been panned here as well. I just wanted to offer my opinion because I tried so hard to like this show but I was just so disappointed and frustrated by the whole thing. Take this for what it is worth.",2
"
                The first episode makes zero sense. By the end, it makes complete sense. 
At the start it may seem like a slice of life type of sci-fi as some geeky friends joke around, but the stakes go up significantly as the show progresses.
What are the consequences of time travel?
If you enjoy time travel stories, I think that alone makes this a story worth watching. Honestly it's one of the better time travel stories I've experienced. This definitely isn't the type of anime to judge based on it's first episode because like I said the first episode makes zero sense (and it's not supposed to... yet).
                  So give it a few episodes before you give up. If you aren't hooked by the 12th episode then this may not be for you after all.
The only major gripe I really have about this show is the harem-ness. It's not bad by any means. It's not new seasonal isekai level. The MC is actually friends with and cares for the female cast, but this was based off a visual novel with alternate routes and it shows.
All that said, this is one of my personal favorites if not my favorite anime. I love the story and it's cast. The dialogue and banter amongst it's cast is so entertaining. Oh and the music. As soon as the piano starts playing, it tugs at my heart strings. To me this is a masterpiece worthy of a 10.
I'd go more into why, but I don't really want to spoil anything. I hope you'll give Steins; Gate a try. Tutturuuuu!",10
"
                To put it roughly ‚ÄúStein;s Gate‚Äù is about a man being driven mad by having to choose between saving his friends, the love of his life and the world using time-travel. If the premise isn‚Äôt good enough to put you onto this show, then you‚Äôd be hooked either way because everything else about it is just so masterfully made; by that I mean the characters, the animation, the story progression and most importantly the screenplay.
This anime is a fine cocktail of traits, that on paper don‚Äôt seem to mix well together but still end up blowing the viewers away. There are characters that feel generic
                  and kiddish contrasted by characters that you wanna strangle to death because they‚Äôre just plain flawed human beings. There are segments of this story that are as light-hearted as a hot spring arc in a slice of life anime contrasted by brutally honest segments that make you hyperventilate.
What I‚Äôve grown to admire the most is the screenplay. The events that transpire in Stein;s Gate have a gargantuan presence in the world. They make or break the future of 7 billion people, yet the anime is paced in a way that it feels as though what happens to the world is secondary to what the main character perceives. The protagonist‚Äôs personal interests seem to be of focus despite them in the grander scheme of things not being significant yet this doesn‚Äôt come off as a flaw in the show but the key element in what makes it soo god-damn relatable.",10
"
                I had heard a lot about this anime and IMO is a good show and kept me entertained, but if I have to give any rating I will give it 7, more than anything because for me, Steins Gate did not bring me anything new¬† with the issue of time travel, it seemed more a mixture of Mirai Nikki, Terminator, the story of John Titor and the Butterfly Effect with a touch of¬† Final Destination. The music is irrelevant except for the opening and of all the characters the only one who I liked¬† is Makise, she is a really brillant, Okabe was neither as
                  a scientist nor as crazy as he claimed, but  he has lovely heart and he ended up falling into the clich√© of the rescuer of the lady in distress or, in this case, the ladies in distress. The show was more a soap opera series not a scientist series and sometimes was predictable. Anyway, it turned out to be very hype series with one another plot hole. However I am NOT saying the series is bad,¬† I really liked the roles of girls characters¬† and this series have had influence thought one of my favorite series: Madoka Magica. And I enjoyed about the¬† ethical and moral dilemmas. In short I found a good entertainment product, but nothing more.",7
"
                After watching the first couple episodes I found myself extremely confused. However, as the anime developed I became intrigued to see where the plot was going. Once the show hits the halfway mark, it really picks up and becomes apparent what the driving force of the plot is. There are some good twists and developments that threw me by surprise. By the end, you will be satisfied for pushing through the confusing moments.
As for the bad. I really didn't enjoy the characters. They all didn't seem very relatable. Okabe in particular doesn't feel like the protagonist you want to cheer on. Mayuri's character does stand
                  out, her innocence and charm really makes you like her. Despite the rest of the characters who just seem there, it doesn't get in the way to not enjoy the good plot. The concept of time-travel is consistent and done well and the anime is enjoyable.
Don't expect the hype many people have placed on this show(the twists are no where near the realm of other shows) but many elements are done well and the show is definitely worth a watch.",8
"
                On the outside the story doesn't look like much nor seem like ""mainstream"" material but once you dig deeper and give it a full watch it's an outstanding experience with masterful storytelling and the most entertaining character interactions (The interactions between Okabe and Kurisu are way better refined and enjoyable than all of the collective interactions between characters in some shows). I've always loved time travel shows and the whole concept of time travel in general so this really filled in the gap for my want of a good anime that involves time travel. Albeit, the show's main weak point is its ""slow"" start which
                  can stop some viewers from getting to the parts of the show where it really develops, but personally it didn't make me want to stop watching the show in any way. Overall, this show is amazing and is definitely a must watch.",10
"
                PLOT (10/10)
This anime has a very solid plot. It doesn't even feel wrong if I say even though there are no plot holes in this anime. The plot that is connected from the first episode to the last episode really amazed me how this anime was able to connect the opening with the ending.  Everything is planned very carefully with supporting concepts and theories.  In the first 11 episodes the audience may feel bored with the slow pacing because it is used for world building and characterizations, but everything will change when entering episode 12 which is the turning point of Okabe's time
                  travel.
VISUAL (8/10)
This anime successfully visualizes the summer atmosphere of Akihabara City as a shopping area through the use of white light and heat effects. What stands out the most is the unique storyboard, especially the board made by Hamasaki and the character acting. I really appreciate the depiction of Okabe's facial expressions that successfully express the horror of time travel and the depression he is experiencing.
CHARACTER (10/10) Each character in this anime gets their respective share in the characterization. What makes me interested is how the character of Okabe is written, which is arguably well written.  From a young man who looks silly, annoying and selfish, he can become a silly but serious and responsible person through a series of events that he experiences. The relationship between the MC and the heroine feels very deep, from Okabe's joke that he calls Kurisu his assistant, slowly their relationship develops into friends and feelings arise between the two. Likewise with other characters, each character in this anime has various characteristics that make it interesting. Despite the many repetitive jokes the characters make in this anime, it's still entertaining to watch them interact.
MUSIC (7/10)
""Hacking to The Gate"" the opening song by Kanako Ito feels like one of the most iconic anime opening song for me. Even so, I think it's a bit boring to hear the same song to fill the anime's opening and ending with 2 cours. The scoring done by Takeshi Abo himself is very integrated with this anime, besides that it is also identical, such as the ""Gate of Steiner"" soundtrack.
CONCLUSION:
Steins;Gate is an anime with a time travel theme that is perfectly executed. Overall it is very enjoyable. 10/10 Peak Fiction.",10

                ‚ÄúNo one knows what the future holds. That‚Äôs why its potential is infinite.‚Äù
Okabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)
Such a powerful quote, from an anime at least just as powerful. It‚Äôs one of the many wise quotes featured in the excellent time travelling tale called Steins;Gate. It is a story praised by many, and I think the show is definitely worthy of all its praise: it‚Äôs an excellent piece of work. Steins;Gate is, in essence, a unique anime. There‚Äôs not a single show that I found to be comparable to Steins;Gate.
But why does everyone think of Steins;Gate as such a masterpiece?
Story: 10/10
Steins;Gate is about Okabe Rintarou, a ‚Äúmad scientist‚Äù
                  who spends his time hanging out in his laboratory with his friends Mayuri and Daru. Ocassionally, they manage to invent futuristic gadgets, though these are never worth mentioning. The first few episodes may turn you down, as it seems like your general slice of life/comedy anime. However, when their most interesting invention, the Phone Microwave, turns out to be able to send text messages through time, everything changes: the text messages sent to the past have a huge impact on the present. When Okabe, in a horrifying way, finds out about an evil organization called SERN, and their ways, he is forced to use time travelling methods to prevent from getting captured ‚Äì and stop their plans. This (around episode 9) is where the amazing Sci-Fi thriller fires up its engines, and puts the viewer on the edge of their seat. What follows is a fascinating (somewhat complex) plot, which manages to blow your mind each episode. Steins;Gate is not just your generic time traveling show; the plot is executed perfectly. Hardly ever before have I encountered such a well thought through plot as featured in Steins;Gate. The show features several jumps in time, but still manages to keep the viewers‚Äô attention without confusing them. The pace present in Steins;Gate is not lacking either ‚Äì in fact, from episode 9 onwards the show holds a perfect pace. Piece by piece, the mystery of the events that happen is unveiled, working towards a fantastic, satisfying ending. (Which is very rare, especially for a show with such a complex plot) Story - and plot wise, Steins;Gate is pretty much an unprecedented piece of art, and I think it might stay so for a while.
Art: 10/10
This is the field in which Steins;Gate lacks the most. Steins;Gate isn‚Äôt a show with a huge budget, and therefore it is to be expected that the art isn‚Äôt jaw-dropping. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean that the art is bad, or that the drawing style is unbearable. In fact, the goal of the art is to portray the atmosphere as well as possible ‚Äì and it does: the art style simply has a way more realistic feel to it than your generic anime.
Sound: 10/10
Amazing voice acting, nice opening, and decent BGM. There were quite some moments where I think there could have been made better use of background music, which is why it misses out on a perfect score here. Nonetheless, very solid sound overall.
Characters: 10/10
What can I say, the characterization in this one is just fantastic. The characters are written in such a way that you are bound to like them. They all have their own likeable and recognizable traits, which are perfectly described from the start: Makise Kurisu the tsundere, Daru the nerd, Mayuri the childish girl, and so on. I found myself having a weak spot for Kurisu in no time. There‚Äôs hardly any character development, but I think this is not necessarily a bad thing; it would only distract from the fantastic plot that is ahead of the viewer. The only character which, logically so, develops, is Okabe: you‚Äôll find him changing in character over the course of episodes, due to the events that unfold. But this is all for the better: this development is, again, done exceptionally well. The development has a very realistic feeling to it (And so do all the characters in general), which makes the story as a whole even more compelling.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Steins;Gate is one of the few shows that manages to score a 10 on enjoyment for me. Like most people, I found Steins;Gate hard to get into, as the first few episodes don‚Äôt really cover much ground. However, once the engine got running, I was hooked. I couldn‚Äôt refrain myself from watching episode after episode, slowly crawling to the awesome ending ahead. And I think most people would; as the plot is set up in such a way to keep you hooked each episode. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, then you will surely enjoy this anime ‚Äì but that‚Äôs not a necessity. Steins;Gate is an anime that is very likely to keep you hooked.

(I'm assuming you read the description on MAL, if you didn't, uh, description spoilers I guess)
The first twelve episodes of S;G are pretty much ""plot establishing"". They're rather uneventful, seldom filled with suspense, energy and mad-ass time-traveling as one would expect. They're weak, in my opinion. The plot is interesting but slow; the characters are unrealistic and rather shallow/unidimensional (rather doesn't equal completely, by the way) and I found myself often pissed off with how ridiculous some events and
                  interactions were. It had a LOT of elements of slice of life.
But then... the next twelve episodes. Now THAT's what we're all looking for. The plot takes an absolute twist, not in ""oh my god so this is the villain and this is the real thing all along?"" as one'd expect from a ""plot twist"". It takes a twist regarding its intentions. Sure, extremely important revelations and explanations are made along the way, but nothing beats that sudden ""plot-shift"". It's sensational, no less. I'm pretty sure you've never seen anything like it - or if you did, it has been once, twice at best. 
**MINOR SPOILERS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED WHAT'S THE PLOT-TWIST**
Dummy text to avoid attention-less readers to spoil their asses. Dummy text to avoid attention-less readers to spoil their asses. Ever watched Memento, the movie? Well, that's pretty much it. Sure, S;G is not as confusing as that goddamn movie, but it is just as brilliant. And the ""slice of life"" thing is secretly plot establishment. I couldn't believe how significant every small, insignificant action and detail was. 
*******END OF SPOILERS*******
The characters, which so far were pretty superficial, now present a satisfactory level of depth; mini-arcs involving all of the supporting and main characters give them great development and by episode 24 Okabe has matured so much it's unbelievable to think he's the same weirdo from the beginning. It doesn't change the flawed aspects of established personalities (aka 'jeez the way she acts is just so out of this world'), as those are inherent to the character, but at least you kinda understand why they're like that. That's what development's all about, folks.
Now, I must recognize there are very few, albeit significant, plot holes in the established time-traveling theory. It doesn't take away the entertainment, though. Trust me, accompanying time travelers is really awesome. They - and you, by extension - knows a lot about what's gonna happen, everyone around is like ""yo dude, are you crazy?"" and you interiorly smirk, ""no, I KNOW what's gonna happen"". Trust me.
S;G is worth it, despite having a slow and rather weak start. So bear it, boy. It's damn worth it.",9

Under no circumstances are you ever to divulge what you read here today. Now without further adieu, let us move on to the magnum opus of the truth I have uncovered.
Story: 10
Somehow a certain portion of the viewing audience has been brainwashed into believing that the story is too confusing to follow. Obviously the lead in the tap water is partly to blame, but I believe the reasons are far more insidious. 
There is conceivably a plot, a
                  conspiracy by groups unknown undoubtedly in league with The Organization, to mass produce and mass advertise mediocrity. Obviously this agenda is being carried out to condition the minds of the erstwhile samplers of genius to habitually zoning out, causing them to view Anime in a fugue state unless there is constant action and bright colors on the screen, rendering the processing of the brilliance that is Steins;Gate an insurmountable task.
Art: 9
Ah and there in lies the rub in our sheets. If the art is good then why does the first scene seem so washed out? It confuses the mediocre mind. How could anyone expect the brilliant array of well drawn frames full of emotion and madness that await the patient viewer?

                Steins;Gate, based on the enormous popularity this series has, was an anime I thought would be overrated but boy was I wrong.
Everything from the soundtrack to each character and their development and backstories to the grand finale of the series was done carefully and truly made with sincerity and love. 
Feelings of despair, hopelessness, sadness, happiness, genuine laughter, hope could all be found within these 24 episodes that were crafted to depict a man with a wild imagination and a good heart. I laughed at the ridiculousness of Okabe's made-up ""Organization"" and calling himself a ""mad scientist"" but the irony is that the stories he
                  made up ended up materializing in the real world. 
Spoilers ahead:
Okabe's childish imagination was so bizarre yet somehow he found himself in the scenarios he made up. SERN is indeed the cruel organization that would reign as a totalitarian regime in the future that Okabe would end up fighting. As Okabe realizes he stumbles on SERN's secrets he finds himself in a position where he's fighting against fate to save Mayuri. As he realizes the difficulty of his situation and the constant time leaps he has to make, he falls into despair further and further each time as he has to watch Mayuri die. He becomes numb to it eventually and the only person he could confide and come to a solution with was Makise Kiruse.
Kiruse's fate being so tragically intertwined with Okabe's as she was the source of the Beta world lines, her life that Okabe accidentally saved was the indirect cause of harm towards Mayuri. The pure anguish that the series conveyed when Okabe realizes the only possibility of saving Mayuri was to let Kiruse die was truly one of the most well-written and tragic conflicts I've ever seen.
And the finale resolves this in a truly cherry-on-top fashion. 
""No one knows what the future holds. It has infinite potential, as this encounter makes clear. This is the choice of Steins Gate.""",10

                This anime is brilliant, I will explain you why...
~ Characters :' The characters in this anime are perfectly made, you can see the development perfectly. Taking Okabe as an example, that when he starts, you can see how Okabe is excited about time travel, in canvio as soon as the plot progresses and he sees what he has caused, it totally changes the way of seeing things in Okabe.
~ Plot :' It may not be the most original plot, but the way it is set makes it excellent. It is just perfect to fit in with the characters, the simple fact of the characters is
                  what gives life to the plot.
~ Openings :' I won't explain this, the Steins;Gate's ops are art",9

                An enjoyable yet lacking . The story, though interesting, could've been executed in a way better method than messy bits of information randomly given. Visual wise, this was bit old. However, this isn't enough to mark it as a masterpiece. i sense of overated anime but i like just one that is HYOUMIN KYOUMA DELUSION IS MY KEY TO WATCH THIS BORED ANIME .probably it related to me somehow and i like it.other than that just to confuse for me even though i like science but yeah it like retarded .i kinda hate some character probably i don't feel some realistic enough probably just my
                  style i want something make the mc feel distress and make him broken untill he start only believe himself and move forward by himself to onward to future and change to accept bullshit reality stuff oh yeah i guess it is not will an anime than i guess BLECGH.so yeah i give overall rating was about 6/10 the reason i like HYOUMIN KYOUMA EL PSY CONGROOO.if not it will be just like 4/10 .sorry if this make someone hate me or what but this my review it just that i kinda annoyed by my friend to watch this thing i mean he tell this shit like everyday probably that why i feel no fun i guess.",6

                (slight spoilers)
I am writing this review after I have watched Steins;Gate 0 so I will talk about some of it. 
Steins;Gate is a story that is amazing and pays homage to older time travel stories. This show references other media, for example, movies like Back to the Future and more that maybe I have not spotted. I love that everything ties together including parts of Steins;Gate 0. In both seasons they have some references to each other and it made me say things like ""oh that's what they meant all those episodes ago!"", and there are multiple foreshadowings throughout the whole show. The story also
                  is an emotional one, and it deals with many serious themes that many people can understand. 
In terms of the art style, I think it's pretty great but I don't think it has stuff like crazy animation and character designs, but I will say it looks really good and it does not look bad.
The music and sound though...
THEY ARE AMAZING!!! 
The music and soundtrack to this whole show are amazing and they help the show a lot, and without the OST I think this show would not be as good. The OST really shines during emotional scenes and It can add to the experience.
In terms of characters, I think every character is amazing and especially our main protagonists. Okabe Ri-... no Hououin Kyouma is in my eyes one of the best main characters of all time. His character development is outstanding and all I can say is it was sad at some parts seeing him. Makise Kurisu is also an amazing character and she does not feel like a 2d pretty girl character with no personality, she instead becomes one of the best characters in the show. All the other characters, Mayuri, Daru, and more are all well written. When the show wants you to hate a character you will hate them, and when the show wants you to love a character you will love them. These characters are some of the best characters ever written.
My enjoyment of this show is amazing. I loved every part of it and I learned why this is considered a must-watch and a classic to many. I laughed, I cried, I felt many emotions that only a small number of shows made me feel. This experience that is Steins;Gate is one I will never forget. This show will be one that will stay with me forever.
Overall this show is a masterpiece no questions asked and I think it is one of the best of all time. 10/10 for this brilliant piece of work.

                omg 
im ngl when first watching this series it was a lot to disgust. i had many people telling me that this was the most complected story ark and out of all the animes i have seen, steins gate was definitively the most complex in that aspect. the first ten episode are hard to understand if u do not focus fully and were at times a bit boring. however after that, the story goes into the most thrilling and outstanding directions i have ever seen in anime. those first ten episodes were just building blocks to the overall plot. tbh it was the most thrilling
                  anime i have to seen to date and might be one of the best thriller animes besides animes like monster. but after completing i honestly think this anime is a top 5 all time and i think many other do think to. out of all the anime i have seen, i think it is safe to say this is the greatest sci fi anime i have seen and may be the best sci fi anime there is. 100% recommend it",10
"
                I'm going to be slightly comparing the anime to the visual novel, as I read the visual novel first. (Slight spoilers in this review)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Story 10/10
The story of Steins;Gate is about a mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, trying to stop the Organization from taking over the world. His delusions, formed by his past, made him to who he is today. No, but seriously, the story is about Okabe Rintaro, a man who will do anything to help others, as he never gives up. Without spoiling, I believe the story is very well done, as the visual novel expanded on the story, but the anime adaption used the
                  most fundamental parts of the story.
Art 9/10
Overall, the art style is very well done. But, the visual novel is much better, as it has more potential compared to the anime. It isn't bad though, it is a solid art style with fluid animations (The cars are in 60fps)
Sound 10/10
Using the soundtrack from the visual novel, the emotions and feelings were brought back to life to the anime. I felt connected and engrossed with the story and characters, so the music, background noise, and everything is amazingly well done.
Character 9/10
This is the strongest category in the visual novel. However, compared to the anime, it felt weaker and lackluster, as the characters aren't really developed  heavily later on. However, just from the anime's perspective, it is well done with the interactions of the main character and his friends. We can see the time they spent together created an everlasting bond. I felt with the character development, we could had added more episodes to the anime, and potentially extend on it.
Enjoyment 10/10
After playing the visual novel, it felt like I was re-watching the series. However, there were some scenes that didn't appear in the visual novel, so that peaked my interest from time to time. The adaption was very enjoyable to watch, and I can see why it is one of the best animes of all time.
Overall 10/10
Even though there are still flaws, not everything can be perfect. Steins;Gate has achieved an amazing, mind-boggling story and with the combination of the characters, told a story of friendship, values, ideals, and morals of time. We must understand that not all things last forever, and we should it the time we cherish right now, and not take it for granted.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is one of the most highly prised anime of the anime community with and that's not only something you can notice by it's high score but by the prices which it gets even ten years after it's creation but does it deserves it?Let's start the review spoiler free.The plot of Steins;Gate is a very good example a story which focus on time travel.Even though It's shows a negative view of time travel it does a perfect work on explanations of what is happening which is a big problem about the time travel stories they try so much to explain even the most little detail
                  and they lose the point but that's what Steins;Gate avoid and it focuss only to explaining the important parts also there are momments where it shows so many info but it's not tiring which is a great achievement.Another strong point of steins;gate is that it knows how to keep it's viewer hooked and put him into it's world with it's mystery,thrill and drama it does a perfect use of them which is briliant.If I had to choose a con is that it can be a bit boring for some people but this it deppends on it's watcher.Now for the sound I will start with the openings and endings which didn't amazed me but the osts were great and they fitted perfectly now the voice acting was great the voice actors were great especially Okabe voice actor was great I would recommend you to watch the sub version just for him.Now let's go to the best part of the story the characters.The cast of steins;gate is what we called lovable it's rare for me personally to enjoy all the characters of the series without expception.The characters are simple as personalities but they still great and that's because we are start to know them better each one has it's purpose and he/she plays a role in the story yes some are more important than others but they doesn't dissapear which is great.Steins;gate is one of the anime which I regret for not watching them earlier is what we could call a masterpiece because it's writing is just phenomenal and it desserves the score and the prising it has.9/10",9

                Steins;Gate:
All Around great anime and I love it to death.
Steins;Gate is definitely something you would wanna watch if you like shows that put the characters psyche/Mental state on display and a show that also focuses on character interactions.
The story is built around the characters, the actions they take, and the consequences of those actions.
The dialog is absolutely outstanding and carries the show and its characters to such an extent as to make it feel like there is never a dull moment.
Another way to say it would be that the characters relations with each other and they're dialog pulls you in and makes you want to
                  see more of they're reactions to each other and how they're relations to each other progress through the story even making me want to know more about what happens to them beyond the story as it is right now.
Steins;Gate has a great balance between being funny and serious.    
There are many funny and interesting scenarios/situations that the characters get themselves into and it is great to see what they do in those situations and they're reactions. 
10/10 Amazingly, exceptionally and extraordinarily great",10
"
                I am not gonna say a lot, but to recommend this Anime to everyone who has not watched it yet. Steins;Gate can easily be enjoyed by anime lovers and people who never watched even one. 
A lot of twists, emotions that rise and fall, everything is being explained (more detailed in the original Light Novel), cute and funny moments and no bullshit plottwist armor and so on.
As for the rating, the Anime itself deserves a 9 and the Light Novel a 10 because there are very important things left out in the 24 Episodes and character design and voice acting by far better in the
                  game.
But still compared to other Animes I rated with 9 Steins;Gate is a big step ahead and thats why 10.",10
"
                At the very start, time seemed to be a concept that people believed they could control, yet the plot of series clearly showed the complicated nature of time and space. The pure emotions of love, heartbreak as well as the belief that this relationship between the two main characters would always be destroyed, no matter the changes. And its this very plot, as well as the characters, as well as ... well pretty much everything. Although it may not be the best of all time, this is only what someone could call a dramatic masterpiece that had me in tears too many times. This simply,
                  what I could only call, as the perfect sci-fi anime.",10
"
                One of the best Anime Adaptations ever.
What starts out as a slice of life develops into a great, classic time travel story. Stein's Gate has one of the best interpretations of Science-Fiction Time Travel than any other book, show, or movie has to date. This is used to its advantage in its plot, which is an emotional rollercoaster that does not exhaust itself. Although its obvious that in its structure and content that it is adapted from a Visual Novel, it still manages to make for an interesting and cute show. 
Since the setting is irrelevant to the plot, I'll start off with the characters.
The
                  main protagonist, Okabe, is the portrait of a smart but dorky aut!smo. He's the rambunctious college dropout who finds himself a loner within a moving society. His chuunibyou type delusions are to make up for his tragic loneliness wherein he finds himself in his own ""lab"" with his only friend form childhood, Mayuri, an innocent dunderhead girl whose pure emotions are so powerful and provoking that it keeps everyone in check. In early exposition Okabe is also shown to be friends with Daru from high school, the obvious neckbeard reddit otaku character, who is FAT. And finally the star girl of the show, genius tsun-tsun Makise Kurisu, whose mere SMUG presence upsets Okabe. I find all these archetypes not too precise to the point of flanderization or annoyance, there is a sense of self-awareness that makes each one of them human, especially in some scenes. The side characters are not really all that interesting but it's okay seeing how they are not really as involved as the main team is. Each design is memorable and colorful, funnily enough except for the actual main character, which I guess is to contrast as a surrogate type character, which is precisely his role as the charming loser might be.  
The plot is such a clever commentary on the ethics of time travel and the humanity of changing one's past. Its almost poetic how the series ends with him discovering the how much of an abomination that time travel is, although it being forced upon them by the evil intelligentsia SERN. I don't find this antagonistic force all-too compelling but it serves as the cause of the main drama of the show. Yes, I find the mysteriousness of SERN to be corny but it does seem somewhat legitimate, and I get the gist of it. If anything it seems more fitting to Okabe's made up ""organization"" he talks about in his delusions, like a real-life hyperstition of such a phenomena. Common critiques of this show are stupid. 1. There are no real plot-holes like people are talking about, each are accounted for in modest fashion. Its unnoticeable to most viewers, and to me It isn't at all irrational or unacceptable. The show handles the mechanics in a pop-science way, but its well explained and simplified to make it easy to grasp. The VN does a better deal of the sort of techno-babble people like, which is quite hilarious since it references Heidegger in anime lol. 2. The build up is completely and utterly necessary, and it isn't even boring to watch. I love Okabe's dialogue so much. He has great witty quips in response to each tsuntsun complaint. I watch it like eating popcorn. In seriousness though, it most importantly serves to outline his later development. He becomes jaded and depressed after the insanity of failure and trauma, which is in stark contrast to his jovial charming personality. The show executes the drama of each scene so intensely and heartily, its very much a celebration of emotion and humanism. 
The artstyle is pretty good. Designs are nice on the eyes. It's unique how the white-tinted colors give it a sort of vibe. One thing I absolutely love is the cinematography. Each shot is so beautiful and capturing. Super underrated concept in anime. The soundtrack is also fantastic. The piano solos are beautifully arranged and precisely apt to the emotional drama of the show. All-in-all, a GREAT show that is forever cemented as a classic in anime history. 9/10",9
"
                Wow, its pretty awesome of this series. masterpiece and fabulous.
I love time travel stories. They are my favorite type of science fiction. But even in a world with Back to the Future and Star Trek IV, I'd still say the most interesting, complex, and utterly captivating time travel narrative I have ever encountered is the visual novel Steins;Gate.
Steins;Gate is the story of Rintarou Okabe, self-styled mad scientist (read: college student) who accidentally invents time travel in the two-room apartment he calls his lab. However, the time machine does not send a person through time, but instead a small, short email.
Much of the first act deals
                  with figuring out the rules of time travel‚Äîi.e., what the ability to send emails into the past can really affect and the unintended consequences of even the simplest of messages.
Over the course of the game, two other forms of time travel are introduced: a Quantum Leap-type machine that allows you to transfer your memories into your past body and a true time machine that can take you physically into the past. However, each of these types of time travel have their own unique rules which limit their usefulness‚Äîas does the multiverse itself.
The complex world it builds is where Steins;Gate really shines. Time travel stories often fall apart due to contradictions in how their time travel works‚Äîwhere rules are established and then later broken for no other reason than that the plot wills it. Despite being rather complex, the time travel mechanics hold together quite well and serve not only as the catalyst for the plot, but also its resolution.",10
"
                First of all, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this anime. It was a pretty good one. Yes, the first few episodes were confusing and the humor doesn't really hit, but once you get to know the characters you start to understand their traits and slowly you start to love them. 
Story 8/10:
The story is very good. It is smart but not as smart as the other time-traveling shows I've watched(Dark). Personally, I think Death Note is way smarter than Steins;Gate, but they can't really be compared because they give off different vibes. Steins;Gate has it all, sometimes it's really dark, and
                  sometimes it's really funny. There were some really unlogical decisions Okabe made or rather stupid decisions, but all that was justified by the fact that Hououin Kyoma was a mad scientist, well more likely he was just a very good guy who wanted to help his friends. 
Art 9/10:
The art was great. It was different, and the characters were very special.
Sound 6/10: 
The only complaint I had was the sound. I really hated the cicadas in the background, they were kinda annoying. 
Character 9/10:
I loved every character except Faris. I found her very annoying with the nya nya talking. 
Okabe was my favorite one. At first, I didn't like him, but as I said before the character development in this anime is outstanding. I loved the way Okabe matured through the episodes, it was so smooth. 
Enjoyment 9/10:
I really enjoyed this anime. Yes, it was confusing at first, but for me, it was still entertaining. Once you pass the 3 - 4 first episodes, everything will start to make sense little by little. You will start to get to know the characters better and start to fall in love with them. The ending was very satisfying. And a good ending sometimes changes the whole idea you have for an anime. 
Overall 8/10",8

                There was a thread here recently about people new to anime being too eager to give out 10s.
That would be me.
One poster suggested that one day, those people would find an anime so good they are forced to revise their previous opinions to fit their new definition of what deserves a 10.
That would be Steins;Gate.
Just a little backstory: I recently took a family trip to New York, decided I'd put a few episodes of different series with me to watch on the plane trips over and back; all of FLCL, a few episodes of Madoka, that sort of thing. Steins;Gate was a late addition to
                  this list, the last in fact. I had about three episodes with me to get a taster, then just before I left, on a whim, I deleted pretty much all the music on my iPod and threw the entire series on there. I love my little whims.
I still don't know exactly why I did it, this series takes the whole ""Watch the first three episodes"" advice and throws it out the window, there is nothing particularly spectacular about the opening three. I remember reading somewhere that the plot gets ""really intense around episode 11"", and while I don't remember exactly what happens in episode 11, it was around that point that the show stepped into its stride. Yet there's something desperately compelling about Steins;Gate, even from its very beginning, I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe it's the brilliant characterisation and interaction, but whatever it is, it's there.
Animation:
While I'm not exactly drawing from a massive reference pool here, I can safely say that Steins;Gate has some of the best animation I've ever seen, second only to what I've watched of Guilty Crown in this regard. It's crisp, clear and neat. The look of some of the characters takes a bit of getting used to, Mayuri for one, but there's really no complaint that can be made here.
Sound:
Firstly, I have to declare my love of the opening theme, even after 24 episodes of it, I sometimes found myself going back again and again to listen over and over. Other than that, I can't say I really noticed the music at many points. I appreciate this actually, it never tried to steal the show, but instead just contributed to the atmosphere of the show.
Story:
Starts out fairly simple really, a few guys and gals make a machine that can send text messages to the past, and the story follows the consequences and potential of this, by and large. However, as usual, where time travel is involved, the plot will inevitable convolute (Is that a word?), and it does so in a delightfully interesting fashion. There's no waste or filler episodes, the entire series is one big arc, and all ends are tied up nicely. Once it gets going, Steins;Gate progresses at a nice pace, it never feels rushed or sags, so I can't really complain in any way about the pacing. It takes certain situations, and leads them in a way that makes you predict the conclusion, then takes a radical twist at the last second. It's a fantastic way of keeping the viewers' attention, and I'm raving like a fangirl now. The show does get almost episodic  in the late teen episodes as it focuses on certain characters, but it never loses sight of the final post.
All I'll say is that the last two episodes are odd, and nearly out of place. Other than a surprise cameo at the very end, the last few minutes of episode 22 would make for a typical ending, but I'm glad they opted to bring the sort of end they did.
Character:
This is where the show truly shines, and elevates itself head and shoulders above pretty much every show I've ever seen. Every character here could get a story by themselves, but it's the way we experience the snippets of each that we do that truly makes us sympathise with Okabe, one of the most ""normal"", but ultimately compelling main characters I know.
Overall:
I had five hours left on the plane home, five hours left and more than one unwatched series, all of I'd been so eager to watch before I left. But I just couldn't. The program that I thought was so overrated six episodes in affected me to the point where I couldn't do anything other than sit back and digest it for the rest of the journey. Once I got home, my mean score was cut by a full point as I had to adjust my list to the new standard. So I don't really think it's necessary to end this review with any more waxing lyrical, instead, I'd like to give a message, to all the anime makers of the world: The bar's been set baby! Come and wow me.",10

                This is a good show, with interesting characters, an interesting concept, and a good ending. I enjoyed it. However, it is currently the 3rd highest rated anime ever on MAL, and I don't really know why. Maybe I just don't like the type of stuff that went on in this show as much as other people, but it's rated so high! There are tons of people that consider it the best anime of all time as well.

I'm not even exaggerating, the story is very witty, it may require you to pause the video sometimes and think about for a bit what just happened or maybe I'm just dumb for not getting it immediately. Oh and also, each of the characters interconnect to each other, it may seem like this character does nothing but boom guess what, epic plot twists.
Below may contain some minor/major spoilers;
At the first few episodes, like episode 1-11, it'll introduce you to the characters and how they'll
                  use the D-mail which sends messages to the past and changes the present. It's kinda boring but Okabe's ""mad scientist"" traits will keep you watching, oh and also I think this is an important factor for character development and build up.
At the next few episodes is where the plot really thickens. Boy oh boy, it's like Re:Zero where Okabe tries to save Mayushii from death but it seems like fate doesn't want it to happen. Also major character reveals you would not expect, like what ""this guy is a SERN?!"", ""this girl is her daughter?!"", it's packed with surprises!
And lastly when you think everything's lost at episode 22, resetting all those three weeks of fun and D-mails, you get a chance to still meet your love again, which only you remembers. Wow, think about that where you've accepted the lost of someone, treating it all like a dream but you get to meet and be with her again. 10/10 would definitely watch again sometimes.",10

                One of the all-time ""greats"" every otaku lauds, I personally never understood why it kept coming up in discussions, that is until I watched it. After that I immediately understood why it is considered one of the greatest in the medium. A gripping story, likeable and relatable characters, and top this all off with some of your typical anime stereotyping (or even satirization, Itaru was hilarious!) and you have the recipe for one of the most amazing anime I have ever watched, Steins;Gate.
The best part about this anime is, honestly, all of it. There is not one aspect of it that trumps above the rest
                  and becomes a singular reason of watching the show, instead every component of the show, be it the plot, worldbuilding, characters, all build off of each other and prop each other up, making a show that excels in every category. An amazing show for any set of preferences.
Words cannot express how good this anime is. If one is reading this, stop reading this and start watching the anime immediately.",10

                Steins;Gate is one of those anime that live up to all of the hype that people let on. I am going to give a basic review without spoiling anything (hopefully), but Jesus Christ. 
Very few anime have the physical and emotional impact that Steins;Gate holds in its hand. No series has elicited such psychological despair and sorrow with the main characters in all the best and worst ways possible. The character development of Steins;Gate is not able to be competed with and the story is something that you will sink into so effortlessly. Every aspect of this series will leave you wanting more and more.
                  
This was a beautifully made show that made 24 episodes feel like a true universe of story and development. Never before has 24 episodes felt this in depth and eternal. 
It is a slow to roll start but, after a second watch, you notice the small nuances as to why the beginning needs to be slow and needs to be so detail oriented. 
There is nothing that is not meticulously calculated in this anime, and it all flows together in an extremely harmonious story that doesn't fall any short of complete. 
An Actual Masterpiece of an Anime that I can not recommend enough to anyone.

                After I first watched this anime, right away I watched It again :) It's awesome.
No more words are needed. Anyway:
Anime is bassed on Visual Novel, and it's great adaptation. 
Story goes around Okabe Rintarou, Hououin Kyouma, Okarin (three name and one person, {like god in christianity :) sry if you are religous and I offend you :)})
First part of anime 1-9 has a perpouse to introduce characters and concept of Time travel. To be fair those epsiodes are not that great and many animes are at least as good as that, But in those episodes one mad scientist do a great job and you can't
                  stop watching it :)
During episode 9 something in anime is changing, anime gets little more serious with cabooooom on episode 12.
After episode 12 we can experience something that is really hard to find, no spioilers but what episodes 13-24 shows is a struggle against fate and world by our protagonist. We can see many emotions which are perfectly made.
For me this anime may be best that I watched so far, it's offen changing with DN can't decide. Anyway going on with review.
Art: great and it's fits. Design of characters is great and backgrounds are high quality, microwave phone (temp) looks great.
Sound: I don't know how many times I already listen to main thene Gate of sinister. And how many more times I will. And every time when I hear version which is played when ""something tragic"" happen I found myself with tear in eyes.
There are also many great seiy≈´.
Characters:
Protagonist of 3 names is great and unique. One of best characters there is.
Shiina Mayurii...  In the end it would look like Name great character and it could contain spoiler so lets skip this.
Anyway in the end it's one of best anime there is and it's fully deserve top1-2 on my list and place 3 on MAL, although what I found wery surprising story in VN and how it's shown is even greater which is hard to belive when you consider sole anime being that great. I won't go into details but if you considering should I play it or not, do it, I am sure you won't regreat it.

                Steins;Gate was recommended to me by a friend who knew i love time travel stuff and everything related to time. so i personally got a lot of enjoyment from this series. anyone who likes complicated time travel and anything of a related sort should most definitely watch this.
now i will reveal the reasoning behind each rating i gave it.
story- 8: mainly because it got really complicated at some moments. while its true i kept up with it most of it towards the end i started to overload and my brain stopped putting pieces together and i missed a lot of important stuff.
art-8: the art was
                  always really important because it always seemed to play a role in some way in the plots advancement so obviously they had to make it good and they delivered
sound-7:i loved the music of this series the happy OSTs, the sad BGMs and everything in between its just a lot of the time it wasn't extremely audible and if it was that's because nobody was talking
characters-9: at first i gave it a solid 10 i loved all the characters but i downed it to 9 for one reason for characters like daru and mayuri (more so for daru) we didn't get to see a lot of their past with okari. i really wish they could have expanded on Daru's story
enjoyment-10:i mainly gave that one a personal rating but lets be honest chances are if you're watching this series you were either referred to it or were interested in things like this, so i hope its safe to assume you are here on purpose
conclusion: overall- 9: with the exception of a few character story gaps, and quite music (which probably wont bother most people),and  a slightly complicated story; this story has ran up my list to the top 10 sitting at 6 place
i loved every aspect of it.
i hold it in high regards and definitely recommend you watch it.",9

                Steins;Gate took a while for me to get into. I thought it was good but I did not love it while or right after I finished the show. So what changed? Why do I have such a deep compassion for it now? I dunno really.
I bought the Visual Novel for $30 on Steam, but as of right now I've only played it for 5.4 Hours (which is only the second episode of the anime). I don't know why I wanted to buy It so badly, by all means it was in irrational decision as it is my most expensive game in my library and yet
                  one of my least played games.
I think the reason I love Steins;Gate so much is because I didn't want to leave the world it had created. Right after I finished the anime, I felt a deep void in my life and I felt like I was missing something. The world and the characters from this series are so believable and likeable that Steins;Gate makes you feel as though you are spending time with a group of your friends. Here's what I rate the anime as a whole;
 Story=9
I love Steins;Gate's unique look at time travel. Its not anything like any other  time travel themed media. Even if it's kind of a stretch, sending data back in time seems wayy more realistic than using a time machine and travelling back yourself. Albeit creating such a machine with a phone and a microwave is not believable, but I don't think that's the point.
To me I enjoyed the first half almost as much as the second half. The reason I enjoyed it might've been because I like the characters.
The Ending of Steins;Gate was amazing though and not only does it clear some things up about the first episode, but I think it makes a proper ending for  the series.
 Art=8
I do not have much to say about the art, because I really don't care as long as its not bad. And its not
 Sound=10
To be honest I don't pay attention to the actual sounds while watching anime. Except for the Cicadas which I thought were very atmospheric but also only slightly annoying.
I watched Steins;Gate In sub and I liked all the VAs, and I especially like Okabe's mad laugh. ""I am mado scientist, It's so cool!""
As for the music, the op 'hacking into the gate' is a bop and it is also my favorite anime op. The actual OST is amazing as well, It sounds very sad and I like that. My favorite tracks are; 'Promise', 'Christina', 'Farewell', and 'Gate of Steiner' (all of the Iterations there are like 7).
 Characters=10
I love all of the characters, including Ferris who makes cat puns and says ""Nyan"" at the end of every sentence. Each character has their own quirks and they are all extremely likable. It was also nice to see how Okabe changed throughout the show.
 Enjoyment=10
What can I say I'm a Steins;Gate fan now
 Criticisms of the series: 
The only bad thing I can think of is the fact that every time Okabe time leaps, he is the only one to retain memory. I understand why this is the case , as Steins;Gate is an adaptation of the visual novel. but yeah that's my only complaint.
Overall=10
Steins;Gate is the best anime I've seen yet. It managed to create some of the most likable characters in anime and in fiction. I am extremely passionate about the series even if I am not %100 sure why. Go watch it now if you haven't already. El Psy Congroo",10
"
                It's hard to put into words the effect Steins;Gate as a series has had on me. It was one of the first anime I became so invested in, I literally could not sleep until I finished it.  Even now, all these years later, it remains as one of my all time favorites. There are just so many reasons why I love this series. The characters, the time travel elements, the twists and turns, the slice-of-life elements, they just mesh together perfectly. And prepare to cry. A lot. This show will tear you apart. The show may start off slow, but because of that slow
                  start, the events that take place later on have so much more impact. This show is #4 on MAL for a reason. If you haven't watched this masterpiece, go watch (or play) it right now. You will not regret it.",10
"
                Steins; Gate is one of my top anime of all time.
With a wide and varied cast, most if not all the characters are likeable and the humor is pure lighthearted fun, it's not without a few flaws/misses here and there, but they are few and far in between. 
While I consider Steins; Gate more comedic than anything else, it offers tonal shifts and can take itself seriously when it needs to. Super interesting and fun premise that is used to it's maximum potential, and a romance that is told at a pleasant pace.
It has a neat and nicely told story with sudden and unexpected twists
                  that will tug at your heart strings.
If you still haven't watched it you should, and if you already have, then give it a re-watch.",9
"
                This anime is the reason I started watching anime to begin with.I can't believe all those years after watching movies and TV shows,i didn't gave a chance to animes.This anime is pure masterpiece and must be watched.Originally it is a Visual Novel but for now I'll talk about the anime which I believe its a great presentation of the original VN. First of all the, story is absolutely outstanding with the best use of time travel and butterfly effect I have ever seen in a movie or TV show, incredible sudden mind blown twists and turn of events,and strong creation of emotions. The art is
                  very polished and absolutely fits with the Anime. I am saying this because the art style on the original VN is different and some people may think that only the original would fit.As of the sound, it's pretty good with an excellent English dubbed voice acting and sound effects.Where the anime shines, except the story, is the developement of the characters, where a strong feeling of empathy and emotional overwhelm is making them absolutely memorable.This anime is pure masterpiece and absolutely needs you to invest your time to it.My favorite anime of all time.",10
"
                Steins Gate should be recommend to all those who love and cherish Anime, but also to those who don't have the slightest clue on what anime is. Especially those who are mild/hardcore fans of science fiction who are mostly into the concepts of time travel. The story jumps right into the main plot without any delay, or for the need of having filler/recap episodes. In order to truly understand what goes on in the story, depends on you attention span and interest when watching the anime. As the story progresses it continues to escalate in suspense and the feeling of some confusion due to events
                  that take place in the story. Steins Gate has a good flow of build up and anticipation in story. The characters themselves not only become involved in the story but also struggle with there own internal conflicts due to the progression of story. Although it has these attributes, in the end you most likely will not get the conclusion you are looking for. At the same time though its ending dose indeed make sense after looking back on the anime itself. As mentioned you do not have to be a hardcore sci-fi/ science geek to understand the fundamentals of the story. If you like drama between characters and story twists within stories that result to question then is indeed Anime to watch.",10

                Destroying Steins;Gate with facts and logic.
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
First of all, I am not a fluent English-speaker, therefore there may be mistakes and a lack of vocabulary. This is also my first review here. Secondly, if in order to explain plot holes, you need to come up with theories, then it‚Äôs not an explanation. You can‚Äôt solve a math problem by adding an extra variable. I am against it also, because it will definitely lead into fans being smarter than creators and fans wrongly thinking that creators are genius. And lastly, I don‚Äôt need to watch Steins;Gate 0 or play a VN in order to
                  understand what is going on. Steins;Gate the anime is a self-contained project that is considered to be a masterpiece. It doesn‚Äôt need DLCs. So if SG0 explains something, I‚Äôm sure it also adds even more plot holes.
So, I think there are 2 ways of time travelling that make common sense: either it is impossible to change past at all (travelling is a part of Fate‚Äôs plan) or an alternative timeline is created where Grandfather Paradox doesn‚Äôt exist and where there may be two versions of one person (a time traveler and not). In other words, either Fate exists and you can‚Äôt defeat it or it doesn‚Äôt exist at all! Any other fictional rule of travelling will lead to questions.
This show tries to unite these two ways. You can‚Äôt change the past but if you change something drastically, then Fate is like: ‚ÄúYo, I didn‚Äôt sign up for this! I‚Äôm out.‚Äù. If you already don‚Äôt smell some bullshit, then I don‚Äôt know how else to explain to you that there is one. Anyway, heroes didn‚Äôt win the lottery and they are still friends with Faris after her d-mail, so this system works pretty well until it suddenly does not.
Somehow, Faris‚Äô dad‚Äôs life is less important than Mayuri‚Äôs life. And this guy changed the whole city‚Äôs infrastructure! I think that Okabe would still start a resistance against SERN even if Mayuri‚Äôs alive. And it doesn‚Äôt even have to be SERN who will kill Mayuri! So, why is her death so important!? And what‚Äôs with that nonsense car chase scene? Why was the driver doing this? Where did they go after killing the girl? Am I watching Final Destination?
Also, why Mayuri‚Äôs death‚Äôs date is always postponed 24 hours later? If an explanation is that it‚Äôs a timeline who tells protagonist that he is doing everything right, then **** this explanation. This means that Fate is too kind. And why did SERN tried to capture heroes one day later also? From their perspective nothing changed (heroes know too much and they built time machine). Why wait one day?
Another main question is what do SERN, Mr. Braun and Moeka know? And since when they start knowing? Well, they know that heroes were thinking of promulgation, so it must be Braun who heard about it through the window and he told about it to superiors. So SERN already knows about heroes, either because of Braun, or because of a secret database where a first d-mail is located or because they hacked Daru‚Äôs PC. Damn, they even launched an operation in order to capture them. So how, please tell me how deleting information from their database days later will change the timeline since SERN already knows that heroes have built a time machine!?!? And why later in a show they aren‚Äôt doing anything! They are just letting Okabe doing his timey-whimey stuff!
It seems that Moeka knows that SERN wants to build a time machine? Why does a pawn know that? Her only goal was to find IBN, she does not need to know about SERN‚Äôs secrets! Why did Okabe tell her everything after she mentioned FB? Why did Moeka visit the lab after Luka‚Äôs d-mail? Is this because of despair, because she hadn‚Äôt found IBN in a shrine (this is what I call ‚Äúadding an extra variable‚Äù)?
Now, in second episode Makise proved that time-travel is impossible. We don‚Äôt actually see the discussion in class, just a board with pseudo-science stuff on it, but her statement proved to be right, because in the beginning heroes don‚Äôt travel through time. They send their memories through it. But then Amane shows up and boom: physical time travel! I thought that it was one of important world-building rules. Makise proved that it is even theoretically impossible, but no, she was just wrong. And why did Amane forgot everything after travelling to 1975 and remembered everything only and only 11 years before 2010? Is this because of year 2000 problem (adding variables again)?
And why, why exactly does Okabe remember everything? I find it interesting that after building Time Leap Machine our special protagonist is not that special anymore. Why was SERN sending threats? Why was time stopping during Mayuri‚Äôs deaths? There was no foreshadowing that Braun is FB, while there were a lot in Amane and Moeka‚Äôs cases. In twenty third episode there was a talking about a time paradox. Time paradox!? Damn, I hate when time travel stories tell that people are able to mess with time how they want, but meeting yourself is a huge ‚Äúno‚Äù, somehow.
Now the most ridiculous thing: superstitions actually work in this anime! Right, Luka could change their gender with a help of superstitions! That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm done! Steins;Gate lost all my respect as a serious, complex sci-fi project.
Well, no, when a series does something good, it does it good. For example, in first version of alpha timeline Amane didn‚Äôt exist. She couldn‚Äôt save heroes from SERN, they got captured and now we got a dark future. Amane was born, she travelled to past, saved heroes in thirteenth episode and we got a second version of alpha timeline where SERN is doing nothing to stop Okabe (they could steal the machine while he was not home or idk) and he successfully destroys this timeline. Now look, without future-Okabe‚Äôs scream, past-Okabe wouldn‚Äôt have noticed Makise‚Äôs corpse and wouldn‚Äôt have sent his first d-mail. He would just go home and wait for WW3. Then Amane is born, she goes to past and forces protagonist to save Makise, because he is her uncle. But there is no Operation Skuld, therefore he fails, screams and that‚Äôs when past-Okabe finds out the corpse, goes to alpha timeline, wins because of everything I described earlier and creates Operation Skuld. How do you like it? Well, actually it‚Äôs just one huge variable and we just see a Bootstrap Paradox without a beginning. Now let‚Äôs find out why in RadioKaikan there are only two Okabes, and not three.
What do I think of Steins;Gate as a whole? It‚Äôs OK. I always liked psychological thrillers and time travel stories. And a psychological thriller part is well-done. The atmosphere and color correction is great, the dynamic between heroes and jokes are good. If only plot and its holes weren‚Äôt bugging me that much. I watched SG first time 6 years earlier, because I was trying to find a great time travel project. Dark didn‚Äôt exist that time, so I watched SG and I remember not liking it much. When I created my anime list, I gave it 6 based on my feelings. And now, after rewatching, it‚Äôs still 6. Seriously, guys, if you want to see a good piece of media about time travel, go watch Dark or play Quantum Break. It just saddens me that many people praise SG and say that it‚Äôs perfect, while actually it‚Äôs the most overrated anime ever. I believe you can prove me wrong in one thing or two, but I think there are too many wrongs with this show. If you will somehow manage to explain everything to me, I will only be glad and will apologize.
P.S. Sadly, this review is invalid, because I like SAO2 more. Am I right, guys?",6
"
                I really like that the characters aren't too gimmicky and act like real people. Well, Okabe was weird at the beginning but he gains more depth as the show goes on, especially when shit gets real. The dynamics are also really enjoyable, every one of them feel like they click with each other. 
Okabe and Kurisu are one of my favorite pairings ever. What a power couple that mutually supports each other and work as a team to solve problems. I feel that these types of couples are a rarity. 
The art and animation are solid, and the ost is fantastic too. The sad music
                  really gets you and the op/ending songs slap.
The time travel plot is extremely well done too, I honestly can't find any plotholes at a glance. There may be a few found by the more intense analyzers but it's overall very solid time travel logic. I'm a science major so I really loved the sciency explanations for it.
SERN also feels very realistic as a villain because of the execution. They aren't over the top evil, they're more the unsettling kind of evil when you learn about their experiments and Rounders.",10
"
                I was not a very crazy anime fan, but I always like amazing stories. However, I started my anime journey by watching this anime and I got the finest one here. Its story is totally about time travelling and to understand this you don't have to be a science student.
Many people argue on the slow starting of the story, but as soon as the story develops it transforms into a very deep and an emotional one. The pacing of the story, the way they play with time in both storytelling and the plot itself is just superb.
The music is good, the animation is quite nice
                  and the voice acting was great, especially with the ""mad scientist"". I can tell you that eventually he will become one of your favorite characters ever.
""No one knows what the future holds, that's why its potential is infinite""---- Okabe Rintarou (Mad scientist)
Such a great and intense quote from an anime is quite powerful. This is one of the best quotes of this excellent time travelling tale. Time travel always tempts human beings, but till now its mystery has not been uncovered. So, a great imaginative power is necessary to draw such a great story. But still it's within our reach as it doesn't have any deep sci ency staff.
This show got all packed just right: drama, romance, sci-fi, action and comedy. And in the end it has some philosophical meanings: If the time travel would be possible, could a escape his fate? What would he/she do with almost divine abilities? And what does time really mean?
In the end, I think that I was able to love this show or understand its meaning, because I watched this in a specific order. I bet if you watch it in that order you will definitely enjoy this show.

                This isn't going to be a real review. I'm still stunned from what I just watched. I don't think I can give the attention a full review would warrant. And I don't think I could ever do justice to the show. I'm sure I will end up with a few spoilers, so just don't read if you don't want to know. And trust me, it's probably better for you to try and figure out the twists yourself.
Steins;Gate just blew my mind. I mean really. Imagine Lelouch Lamperouge waking up in a hospital and marrying Kallen after the events in Code Geass. Also imagine that there
                  were no major plot holes, no feeling of the anime dragging on for far too long, and no feeling that the character designs are just too ridiculous for real life.
That's right, real life. An interesting phrase because science fiction requires a certain suspension of belief in the first place. I feel like the major difference here is that in most cases either it's very difficult to gain a full suspension of belief for the story, or the characters are unbelievable themselves. It's almost always the latter for me. What story can be complete without characters that you can imagine meeting yourself?
Okarin is an absolutely amazing and deep character. From the very start you think he is insane, and then just a strange sc-fi aficionado, and then you realize that there is a lot more to him than you think. And honestly it is only a good bit through the show where you can be completely sure that he isn't really the mad scientist he tries to portray.
Honestly, this show has to be the masterpiece of masterpieces among anime created thus far. It immediately goes on the very top of my list of favorite shows. I don't believe in perfection, but this is as close as I have seen an anime come. It takes the hope I had for Death Note before L died, and through the first season of Geass, and it finishes it like neither of those shows could. And let me just add some more superlatives to it so I can finish gushing and go watch something else for a bit: amazing, incredible, stellar, superior, ultimate, etc.

"
                Steins: Gate is a well made anime that does an excellent job at manipulating the viewers emotions. 
Story wise SG has an awesome time-travel related plot that takes the viewer through a lot of twists and turns. It pushes you through just about every emotion you can think of: joy, anger, sorrow, shock, and despair. The story never stops moving forward but it does take a break every few episodes to focus on character development while never entirely coming to a stop. The only reason I took a point off for the story is because, being a time travel plot, it can be slightly obtuse
                  at times and the logic used to bring the story to a close is somewhat questionable in my opinion. The story makes some pretty cool uses of Chekhov's gun and so certain details should be paid attention to but those details usually end up explained after the fact anyway. The story alone is a good reason to try this show.
The art of SG is alright. I liked the scenery and background styles but the way some of the characters were drawn displeased my eyes. Example: the way Makise's jacket is drawn constantly hanging off her shoulders is incredibly irritating. It never moves or falls down or gets pulled higher up on her shoulders. Just something that bothered me.
There wasn't anything wrong with the music used in this show and I liked the opening and ending themes but other than those nothing really jumped up and grabbed my attention music wise. I watched the dub and it was pretty good. The only people that could possibly complain about it are subleetists and if you prefer subs you probably shouldn't be watching the dub anyways. 
The characters are probably the most iffy thing about this show. The two main characters(arguably) of this show act like socially awkward middle school nerds. It gets better as the show goes on but it never stops being annoying. The only one of the characters to really get any character growth as the series goes on is Okabe but the side characters not listed do have their backgrounds gone into a little bit.
     Okabe ""Nickname I can't spell"" Rintarou - The shows protagonist in chief is constantly pretending to be a mad scientist with not notable science background or attitude. He may be the leader but all the great ideas in designing things come from his buddies. He is kind of childish but as the show goes on you get used to it and he drops the act a little. He is nowhere near the worst protagonist I've ever watched in an anime though.
     Makise Kurisu - Based on the tsundere templet she actually gets a little depth to her character instead of just acting sweet and sour. She has the tendency to give Okabe shit with and without good reason but can also actually show her true emotions around him without everyone making a super big deal about it. The first 1/2 of the team's scientific mind. 
     Shiina Mayuri - Plot device. That is her purpose in life and she barely acts like a normal human being. She has no goals in life and exists primarily to follow Okabe around. 
     Hashida Itaru - This guy is the sarcastic sidekick of Okabe. He is also 1/2 of the teams scientific intelligence with his deus ex computer kung fu. He acts as the realist and unrepentant pervert of the team as well.
I definitely enjoyed this series, especially after the firs few episodes when you really start to understand whats going on. Apart from relatively minor flaws this show is among the 10% of shows that isn't crap and I would personally consider it in the top 5% of that 10%. Worth giving it a chance at the very least.",8

                This is a completely biased review, this is my favorite show, and that might affect how i view and describe things. So lets get right into it. Story 9,5/10. You are up for a ride. Yes. The first season consists of amazing story line, great naration, miraculous plot twists and of course a mild taste of harem which is the reason my biased rating is not absolute 10/10. I wont spoil any bit of it because everything is well placed and beautiful. I could go on for some time, about how spectacular everything is. But lets just leave it at that, you wont be disappointed
                  if you are a lover of a fulfilling storyline. Characters 8/10 that's basically the only part that I ll try to leave my biases behind in terms of story elements. The characters are throughout well designed but not properly explained. The Visual Novel as well as the extra movies(+ans extra season of explaining and side storying) addresses pretty well. But as a sole series you only see the tip of the mentality of side characters such as Makise and/or Haxor. Could they have been less blunt? No, that was the point of the show. But addressing the problems is justified. The story really is centered in a way that over explaining on each character would be pointless and hurtful for the plot itself. Art 8,5/10. Its pretty, its not Violet Evergarden level, but its pretty, the scenery, the close ups, the opening art, the meaning behind almost everything. Subtle, but as it should be. Soundtrack/Music:10/10. This is the sole category that creators overdid themselves. Everything is on point. Subtle. They took the extravagant sounds of the VN and created a fitting work that is nowhere else to be seen, with only a few exceptions. Its really a great experience and no words can describe such majesty. Adressing the upcoming judgement on this: Its not epic, it was never created to be epic. Its not comperable with epic soundtracks such us Shingeki no Kyojin,Violet Evergarden or Rainbow. To end this review I will give my honest opinion, Its the best scientific/dramatic anime of its genre. Everyone should watch it. Even if they dislike it, Its a masterpiece that should be watched by everyone. Thank you.",10

Steins Gate is mostly a science fiction anime, not something I would usualy watch because of many reasons. As a very science intrested person, I find many of the illogical moments pretty annoying and I find myself complaining about mock science all the time. Most people don't seem to be bothered by these things, which I almost envy. 
Steins gate was not an exeption. I found myself not agreeing with almost every explanation of the time travel stuff exept for some aspects of the butterfly effect. And don't even get me started on the fucking banana in the mircowave...
I was VERY suprised how little these problems bothered me. 
There are two reasons why, First: The series didn't really seem to take itself so seriously in the start where most of the science was explaned. That, I think, was perfect timing. When the series moved closer to the climax, I learned to just accept the fake science beacuse I was too intrested in the story. They basically made fake science intresting, that's really fucking impressive. 
The secound reason: The characters. I found myself really loving the characters.
 First: Okrain. He was the comic relief character and a amazingly developed, deep character att the same time. Though, almost all characters had some comic relief elements to them (which was highly needed in such a dark story). If there is a main character that's close to perfect, it has to be him. Also, the voice actor was fucking amazing. He seemed to have alot of fun while recording and he really made Okarin come to life. Who can forget lines such as ""I am mad scientist! It's so cool, sonovabitch"". Perfect casting.
Secound: Kurisu. She is easily one of my favorite female characters of all time. The fact that she wasn't just ""sold out"" with fan scervice is something I greatly appreciate. I feel like she was developed amazingly, I loved her relationship with Okarin and she just felt belivable. 
What I loved about all the other supporting characters is that they were needed for the story. That is very rare. They also all felt like real people with real emotions and you started to care about them. That's also very rare. 
I only really rate the enjoyment because it's the only thing that really mathers but if I had to rate the characters, I would give them a 10/10. 
When it comes to the art, I feel like it's nothing amazing like the artwork for Kimi No Na Wa but it held up really well. I loved all the character designs and I liked the colour palette. It gave the series a nice theme and brought it to life. This was also released in 2011 and it stills holds up great. 
When it comes to the sound, as I mentioned, I loved the voice acting. But not just for Okarin, the other voice actors preformed really well. Brilliant casting. My only complaint is that Feris nyan got annoying after a while... 
I didn't personally enjoy the Intro that much. It just felt kind of generic to me but that's just my personal opinion. I really enjoyed the background music though. I almost got goosebumps sometimes when that cool piano started playing at the end of an episode and combined with the amazing timing of the music, it created a vibe to the show that most other series are not capable of crating. 
When it comes to the enjoyment of the series, I have to say 9/10. It is easily one of my all time favorite anime and I doubt that will change anytime soon. With the great story, the extremely likable and amazingly developed characters and the great theme of the show it is really close to a masterpiece. If i where not for the unfortunate fact that time travel is (from our current understanding) impossible and therefor, it is a really hard concept to do right, it would be a 10/10. The thing that bothered me the most is their theory about alretnate worlds (that every action causes a universe where something happen and a universe where it didn't happen). This doesn't work because if something happends, it has to have a cause. If we say event A happen, it has to have had a exact reason for it to happen. It can't not happend in that exact universe and create another senario. If event A didn't happen, the world must change before A where to happen so the reason A would happen would disappear. Therefor, that would not be the same universe to begin with. 
That brought down the series a bit for me but it did an amzing job making these problems minor with its otherwise amzing story and characters. I highly recomend it to everyone, trust me, its worth your time.",9

                I love this anime more than I can say... what a story, outstanding.
Kurisu and Okabe it's such a great love story! My favorite one, this anime mixes humor, drama, love, thriller and in the end it culminates in an epic of feelings of love and anguish that are later softened in the movie.
I wish that everyone who dropped this anime could be patient enough to go through all those 24 episodes.
Here's my recommendation, and it's also worth noting that ""steins zero"" is also too damn good, an alternative story for those who, like me, loved this anime
Please, don't drop it, believe in me :)

                This series is by far one of my favorite anime I've seen yet. Not only the story is great. It shines a light on philosophical questions that I wouldn't even expect from an anime it has also a really touching story. For everyone that looks at this show and asks himself if he should watch it. I suggest you do so. You won't regret it.
The show is about a self-proclaimed mad scientist who discovers Time-traveling, almost by accident, and as he digs deeper all of a sudden he has to deal with great philosophical questions. The show handles this topic really well and although it
                  has a difficult storyline the producers and the studio did a great job. For people who aren't so familiar with anime, it's like a mix of Back to the Future, the Netflix series DARK and Matrix, but with deeper relationships between the characters.",10

                ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**
This anime was like an 8 until episode 7 I think, after that, it just turns into one of the most boring, uninspired garbage anime that I ever watched.
The premise on the beginning was so good but the caracthres man I just can't is so bad how the mc just constantly make the same jokes for 24 episodes, at some point you just get angry if he does the name joke with the red hair woman or the phone evil company joke or the worst joke when he pretends to be so cool with the mad scientist name or something, sorry
                  to use this word but is just cringe and not in a good way.
Also, you may think the story is deep, for a 2-year-old maybe because with such one-dimensional characters like this I knew this wound¬¥t go far. So the scene that just throw me off was the kidnapping scene when he is surrounded by 7 kidnapers armed with real guns and then he just runs away nobody comes after him nobody kills him and he just resets times again and again. Bro? Why? Why your story is so poorly written? You know that if you put him in a situation where he would 100% die and you don't kill anyone then the story loses almost all the impact there is no consequence for wrong actions then and from that moment and beyond I knew that all would just end fine and any plot of someone dying would not be true because they would come alive of any scenario.
One of the top anime of MAL is this and I would like to end this review by saying that John Titor an urban legend was reduced to a young girl with super strength and what happened to the main villain SERN? Well, who cares this anime is horrible and the only thing that is deep about it is the position that is gonna take on my list.",2

                Steins;Gate is a sci-fi anime series originated from the visual novel/game, it is a grand adventure that introduces you to technology seen and discussed in the real world hypothetically. And it teaches you the consequences of the characters actions in a thrilling way, leaving you on the edge of your seat at times.
Lets start off with the characters, shall we? Meet Rintaro Okabe, the main character and a self proclaimed mad scientist. He takes on this gimmick whilst doing very unusual things like pretending to talk to the government on a phone that isn't on, and saying corny lines from TV shows. He establishes the
                  Future Gadget Lab before the show, alongside Itaru Hashida aka ""Daru"" and Mayuri, commonly referred to as ""Mayushii"". Throughout the show Rintaro gains the most development, he's starts off a playful, yet eccentric personality. Commonly winding up a lot of the people he meets. Although he can be very provoking, he demonstrates the importance of all of the characters to him, as he tends to put all of his friends first, regardless of circumstances.
Deuteragonist is Kurisu Makise, who joins the future gadget lab at a very early stage. Makise and Okabe start off very hostile, both will be seen hurling provoking comments or nicknames such as ""perverted genius"" or ""The Zombie"" at eachother. But as the show progresses, their bond significantly strengthens.
Notable characters to mention are Ruka Urushibara, Moeka Kiryu, Suzuha Amane and Faris Nyannyan, all are already/become acquainted with Okabe, and become involved in the plot some way. Each character has their own unique personality and have frequent screen time, which is always good.
The OST for the anime is spectacular, the opening ""hacking to the gate"" is thrilling and is great to get you in the right mood for the episode. And the ending song ""Toki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku"" really amplifies the emotions you feel, as most episodes end on a gripping cliff-hanger or sentimental ending to an arc. Additionally, the songs that play in the background really define the mood, be it relaxed, tense, sad or shocking.
The voice acting is priceless in Japanese. Mamoru Miyano nails the role of Okabe, I honestly am not surprised, as he has nailed every single role I've seen him in! He is filled with passion when playing the character, and that really adds to the experience. The same can be said for all of the voice actors, I could really feel the emotions when listening to characters like Kurisu Makise and Mayuri talk.
Overall this is one of the most fantastic anime's I've ever seen. And it's truly an experience to watch spoiler free. You only get to watch an anime for the first time once, and my first experience of this show filled me with so many different emotions when it ended. this is a very easy 10/10. I wish you a great time when watching this.",10

                Damn, why do all the good shows have to be good?
Steins;Gate is what some might deem a modern-day classic. Released in the Spring of 2011, the anime didn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôd be all that spectacular for the first eight or so weeks of its initial airing. Though I did not watch it as it aired, I understood the frustration of viewers as they had to watch those first eight drawn-out episodes, and if I had not known of this shows nothing less than stellar reputation, I am sure I would have dropped this as it aired. But as I and many others who have completed
                  this show can attest to, if you can get past those first eight to ten episodes, you are in for an absolute ride of a show that never ceases to amaze with the narrative direction it takes. With numerous excellent themes, character developments, and execution, Steins;Gate is a show for any fan of science fiction, as well as any anime fan interested in watching just a damn good show. 
The story of Steins;Gate starts as a simple one and follows self-proclaimed mad scientist Okabe Rintarou, his ‚Äúhostage‚Äù Mayuri Shiina, who we later learn to be his childhood best friend whom he has sworn to protect, and a less than suitable, 2-D hacker girl obsessed hacker named Itaru Hashida, or just Daru to the members of the Secret Gadget Laboratory, stationed in a studio apartment above a CRT TV workshop. I‚Äôm going to spare you of the summary considering there is a pretty good one given to you by MAL. Nevertheless, the lives of these three drastically change after a certain red-headed mad scientist (though not by her proclamation) named Makise Kurisu is murdered atop the building where Okabe and Mayuri have attended a scientific conference, permanently altering the status of time and space over the course of the next three weeks within the universe (or many universes, I should say) of the show. 
The most prevalent theme in Steins;Gate is the importance of extrapersonal relationships and just how much of an effect they have on the inner workings of a person‚Äôs mind. As the plot in this show unfolds, which I will avoid spoiling to the best of my ability, we watch as the characters Okabe has come to adore and cherish, treasure unlike anyone else in his life, be ripped away from him infinite times after everything he has done in his power to rescue them out of the bounds and restraints of time itself. And it hurts, as we watch him fall further into madness episode by episode as nothing, no matter what he does, ever changes. We watch the upheaval of his life in countless instances as he has to undo the decisions of the people around him, sacrificing it all to save the ones he cannot go without. He‚Äôs come so far as a character and has to undo it all, over and over again, and still be the same man that can rewrite the past to save the future. And Okabe does all this because he genuinely cares for these people, something he would not have admitted to doing whatsoever due to his status as a mad-scientist, which he wishes to shed as he comes closer and closer to making things right again. He‚Äôs running himself ragged, day and night across time and space, all for the ones he loves. It‚Äôs gut-wrenchingly heartbreaking and beautifully accomplished. 
The plot of Steins;Gate, while dreadfully slow at the start, never lets up once it truly begins. Episode after episode, you are hit with another revelation character switch up, or plot-twist that changes your entire perception of the show and its characters in such a way that was executed and handled extremely well. While I do believe that if the contents of the first eight episodes were quickened and major plot points at the end were given more time to elaborate Steins;Gate would have been a masterful example of an anime with a plot filled to the brim that manages itself in a way that is simultaneously easy to intake and enjoy as it progresses, I do not believe it hindered the show in a way to its major detriment and detracts significantly from the enjoyment of the show after the first eight to ten episodes. 
Steins;Gate is one the only science-fiction anime with a near-perfect execution of the plot, I cannot deny. With wonderful themes and character development that would make any anime fan in their right mind shed a couple of tears, I can say without fault that this show deserves the recognition and hype from the fanbase it deserves. If you enjoy science fiction, especially time travel shows with neurotic main characters, as this one has many, you will be exceedingly pleased by what Steins;Gate has to offer.",9
"
                This is one of the easiest reviews I will probably give: Steins;Gate is a masterwork. It is probably due to the amount of work behind the visual novels that were made to make sure everything would line up; this is a bit lost in the anime, as of course, being a project with limited time and budget‚Äî there have to be some deadlines to be respected and episodes don't last more than those 20ish minutes.
Steins;Gate's story begins from nothing before it evolves into something that is simply that intricate to even keep track of, however, it is also true there can be some tidbits that
                  you can easily get lost on if you don't rewatch the series a couple more times or simply aren't that attentive.
The designs are fine; they are loyal to the visual novel, although they're not my preferred style as they're all way too slender, especially the feminine figures. There's no way a leg can be that thin without you being unhealthy.
The characters are beautiful. The further you go, the better you will get to understand them.
A masterpiece; watch it.",10

                I must write this preview in a hurry... there is not much time left! *Ring! Ring! Oh! I get a phone call... hello? Headquarters? Yes! I suspect that I have been discovered by agents of the Organisation... what? If this is the choice of Steins;Gate... El Psy Congroo.
Okay! Done with this chuunibyou stuff and back to the main point. So, as you should know, I am extremely happy with this anime, with me enthusiastically typing that whole paragraph of sh*t at the front, and if you check my anime list, it is the only anime I give a 10 out of 10. And, of course,
                  it is my favorite. So now, let me get into the review quickly.
Story:
A lot of anime that I have seen or heard of do incorporate the element of ""time travel"" in it. Go check out the top 15 list of best time travel anime, there are also a few good ones there. However, writing a story ONLY focusing on time travel is EXTREMELY difficult. You have to deal with all kind of theories and paradoxes and load of sh*t. Well, some may describe time travel simply as ""magic"", but I personally prefer science fiction more than magical girls. Steins;Gate did this very well. It gave a reasonable, believable way of time travel, and provided a number of theories (which I personally did a little bit of research on), which is very interesting.
Another thing to point out is that, a lost of people regard this anime as having a bad start but improves a lot later on. Well, in fact, in my opinion, it is simply the opposite. Well, I think that the last 2 episodes are a little bit forced, but it provides some answers to the events in episode 1, which I think is kinda reasonable. Also, episode 1 is in fact the most well-written one. It puts you in a mind-f*cked position, which is deliberately done, and slowly disclose the mystery one by one. Of course, the first half of the series is pretty slow-paced, but I think it is appropriate.
Characters:
This is a part which a lot of anime screw up, like an anime called Sword X X, or X Art X or X X Online. Whatever, this anime passed with flying colors. Every character has his own place in the plot. There is of course a distinction between majors and minors, but everyone of them is essential to the plot. Also, they are quite memorable, too. For example --- oh, someone interrupted me... hey! What are you doing, Kurisutiiina!!! *There is no ""tina""! Okay then, my Assistant! *I am not your assistant either! Okay then, experiment-loving pervert genius girl! *...
Overall:
Brilliant anime, a pure masterpiece, though not flawless. Highest recommendation.
P.S. In the anime, there are in fact unanswered questions. See if you can find them out and solve them.",10
"
                Im writing this after finishing all the OVAs, movies and finally Steins Gate 0. Let me just offer you the viewer just one piece of advice, and that is ""give them some time"". Starting out, the show does make that much sense with chracters randomly saying complex stuff.
BUT once this show lays its foundation it goes nuts, Everything makes sense at once and getting there feels so good. You appreciate the show more.
Now for the show, its simply amazing with each and every character with however strange they are, they have purpose. Jokes, action, serious, smarty moments. this anime has it all. Really pulls you
                  in because, by the time i got past the intro episodes i was sucked in and proceeded to watch everything in release order shown here on MAL. its Worth the entire journey and you will not be disappointed.

                -I used the translator because I don't speak English fluently-
-no spoilers-
Steins;Gate, a work you recommend to your friend and your friend recommends to another friend. Steins;Gate was one of the first animes I watched, I liked it a lot, I watched it again after 2 years, and I realized that it's the best anime I've ever watched.
Story 10/10: MAD SCIENTIST discovers he can send emails to the past, but, oh my friend, you should see this wonderful work and see what happens next.
Art 8/10: For 2011 the art is very beautiful, nothing to complain about, but it's also not like kimetsu no yaiba ep 10
                  season 2.
Sound 9/10: Yes, they know how to place soundtracks where need them, and the opening and ending are perfect
Characters 10/10: Everyone has their personality, this makes each one of them cool and interesting, okabe is without a doubt one of the best protagonists, he doesn't cry, he acts.
Enjoyament: I'm not going lie, the beginning is kind of confusing, but this is explained later, maybe because of this confusion you think about dropping, but this confusion is intentional to understand the end of the work
Overall: Steins;Gate is a masterpiece, at least for me and 50% of the people who watched it, if you haven't watched it yet this is the anime I recommend the most for you.
-spoilers-
Well, now I'm going to talk about the work itself with spoilers, to explain why I think it's so good.
Steins;Gate, since the first episode already shows what is happening in the last ep. By sending the message to daru about the dead christina okabe goes to the beta universe and over the course of the first 11 ep, okabe and his colleagues, make insane discoveries about time travel and secret organization, help some friends changing the past for life of them be ""good"". At the moment that mayuri dies, the anime changes completely, he has to leave the beta universe so that mayuri doesn't die, so okabe has to redo all the D-mails from his friends, to reach the alpha universe, but that's the problem, in this universe christina dies, so he has to ""cheat"" himself from the past so she doesn't die, if she dies and her father gets the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe time machine, world war 3 will happen. In the end he manages to burn the paper from the time machine and save Kurisu.
Conclusion: For me, as the anime presents each situation and the tension of the moment and space, it makes it a masterpiece.",10
"
                Many people have already praised the plot and depth of this anime to high heavens, so I had expected the next Death Note when I finally decided to give in to the pressure and watch this anime. To be completely honest, it was....mediocre. 
My biggest issue was with the time travel aspect that most people seem to regard as the greatest thing this show brought to the table. Yes, the consistency to which it was used and the overall lack of plot holes is refreshing for a time travel story, but somehow it just felt....predictable. Perhaps because I had already read too much sci fi
                  and had seen the concept of time played around with over and over again, but when the great turning point of the anime came (I am often told around episode 9), I had already seen it coming from a long way off. Yes, I know changes in the past will cause changes in the future, and I guess the hype just caused me to want something....more shocking. 
After the realization that the thrilling part had already past, my will to watch this began to crumble, and near the end I became so disappointed I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. 
However, this anime does have great music, pretty good art, and absolutely awesome characters, which is one point I will agree on: I fell in love with all the lab members by episode 5.
However, my prediction of the direction the plot was headed and the lack of a revelation just turned out to be too much. It was like I spoiled the anime for myself, and the rest of the show lacked impact.",5

                ****SHORT REVIEW****
I'll cut right to the chase, this anime can be described in 1 word :-
""INTELLECTUAL BAIT"" 
Story: 8
The story is the typical time travel based theme where the protogonist goes back and forth in time to prevent /change the future. The plot is pretty good but is predictable(well,atleast for me).I liked the fact that the characters all had an important part to play in the story. One more thing i would like to point out is the ending.
It was what u call a complete ""asspull"".
Art: 8
I liked the art since it was based on dark colours which matched the theme of this anime.sound: 7
All i can say is it suits the anime. Not too good but not too bad either,just average.
charcters :8
I felt the charcters were developed pretty well ,so i will end it here since i cant go into them much without spoiling the plot.
enjoyment :7
I found it enjoyable at some points , but was bored at some points ..(probably because of the pathetically slow intial pacing of the first 10 episodes or so)
overall :
7 +1=8/10 (+1 for the god like trap)
I dont know why this is rated so high on MAL ,I felt it was just an average anime which tactfully baits people by using interesting theories but well in the end its worth a watch i guess. .
As i said before , the ending was an typical ""asspull"" and i felt betrayed since it denied reality a bit. Overall i guess it can be watched depending on your interests and ""to know more about the theories of time"".So i will conclude this part of the review by saying its not a ""must watch"" category but a likable series which can be suggested to friends .
P.S. ""English not my first language so may have gramatical errors. ""
pros:
-decent plot
-decent art 
-average sound
cons:
- ending was pretty dissapointing 
- plot is predictable
- ""intellectual bait""
- overhyped",8

                okay so I'm gonna do one of those standard list things where the reviewer goes through all of the categories and gives their thoughts on that section because I feel like that should work with steins;gate (SPOILERS I REPEAT SPOILERS)
Story/pacing: 10- Easily one of the things steins gate excels at: it definitely is a roller coaster of a story: as in there's the anticipation of what's going to happen in the first half of a big hill, and then going down it is so rewarding: that's steins; gate pretty much. The plot is slow in the beginning and if the show was just one or
                  the other wouldn't be nearly as good, but combined they make it so gosh darn interesting. the first half of steins;gate is all about anticipation and character interactions and development (we'll get to that later), and it's quite entertaining. The pacing is a little off in terms of events in the story, but it's forgivable, and it's entertaining enough. But once the second half kicks in everything the 1st half did make a lot more sense in the story as it basically involves one man risking everything to prevent someone from dying and it's incredible in terms of story, with some much happening at such a good pace. oh and the endings brilliant, not gonna spoil it just in case someone  sees by accident, its THAT GOOD
Art: 8- This is entirely subjective, but there's something off about the art for steins;gate. Maybe its the weird color-coding or the odd lighting a lot of the time but it looks a little... how should I say this... unfinished at times. But it's not bad at all: I actually like the art quite a bit.. the characters designs are top tier, I love how the city looks, the op represents the show very well, and I love how when okarin comes back form a really bad time jump you can tell instantly just by looking at him ( little rule called show don't tell, and btw this show does that well). so overall not the strong suit of the show but still really solid
Sound: 8- Look here's the thing: the ost for steins gate is... fine I guess just nothing amazing. Now I like to judge the ost of a show separately from the show itself but like: I didn't remember a single track from the ost. The saving grace is that the op is amazing and the ending is solid too: correction, all of them are good. that's about it: not much insane stuff but still pretty good.
Charaactesr:10- This is where this shows shines brightest: the characters. My legit only little problem is mokeas backstory is a little, well, unexplored, but besides that, man its good. Okarin's absolute ""carry that weight"" mentality in the second half was thrilling to watch, and he's probably the sanest character in the show. Kurisu is my favorite character in the show just because shes consentient: always helpful, always being a pain (a good one,), always has a little bit of a tsundere side, she's just so adorable and great. She is the best girl by far and she and okarin are a really nice couple. Mayuri is precious: that's all she is, she is impossible to hate, and plays off okarin better than anyone else in the show. all the other side characters are great, but I don't what to make this any longer.
Enjoyment- 10: I absolutely adored steins;gate and its world of characters. It's not perfect, but it's unique and special and unforgettable. I loved the way it handled time travel, themes of dystopia are explored in detail well, there's just so much to love. While idk if I will rewatch it soon, I will go back to it eventually, and it is one of the better anime i have seen.
Overall- 9: Steins;gate is a really damn good show that everyone should check out. it isn't without its quirks, but any anime fan should check it out.",9

                Alright One of the best rated anime on MAL and my No. 1 anime how will it go against an "" objective"" review?
I won't include Missing link - Divide By Zero, because it was aired in 2015 and I wanna rate it like it was 2011. ( I gave Missing Link 9/10 if you wonder)
I will be rating ANIME so I won't be comparing how well it represent LN or manga.
\\ spoiler alert just in case //
Art: 9/10
I think studio did outstanding job to portrait modern era ( 2011), it is perfectly balanced and it feels like a real world.
Characters: 9/10
It is 1st season so it's obvious we'll get introduced to all of our MC's and supporting characters. Our MC is Okabe Rintarou, the self proclaimed mad scientist, he has an ability called "" Reading Steiner"" which allows him to retain memories when time traveling, even though he's always trying to be mad scientist he cares deeply about his friends and is willing to experience immeasurable amount of pain to protect them. 2nd MC is Shiina Mayuri, she is the closest friend that Okabe has, she is very kind person and she has unbreakable bond with Okabe coming from their childhood, which is shown in the series. 3rd MC is Makise Kurisu, she's an scientist from USA currently on a visit in Japan. She's a highly intelligent person, who is able to construct a time machine, also she is caring person capable of showing empathy towards Okabe after his attempts to change the world timeline.
Character progression: 10/10
Now this is gonna be fun to defend. I'll quick synopsis: Main story of S;G is happening in 14 days over and over, because Okabe is trying to change the world line and save Mayuri from death in the begining he warps from "" Beta world line"" to "" Alpha world line"".
Through the season Okabe sees Mayuri dying numerous times. So season 1 of S;G revolves around Okabe, who has Reading Steiner and is trying to save Mayuri from death by changing the world timeline and his development through the season is a masterpiece. His emotions after he sees his friend die are portrayed realistically, he acts like true human being, later through the series when he talks to Makise about it again after he saw Mayuri's death many times, we can hear coldness in his voice, after seeying and experiencing so much it is only natual to be changed by these events and in the end of the season, where he manages to reach other world line, we can see him trying to be mad scientist again, but he's clearly depressed almost ruined by the horror he had to experience. Even when he was living through the same days over and over, his surrounding notices his change, Mayuri to be precise and it's small, but really beautiful detail to her personality, that shows how she cares about him. Everytime he alters timeline a little bit to reach "" Beta"" we learn something new about our characters from their past, or we uncover something they hold secret. I enjoyed all the characters from S;G and I think many of them will remain on my top list of favorites for many years or maybe forever.
Story: 8/10 ( if I would include Missing Link it would be 9/10)
If you've read my review until now, you will have an idea about S;G storyline, but I will do another synopsis just in case. Okabe attends a conference about time travelling, he meets Makise Kurisu who asks him some strange questions, later she is stabbed by unknown person, when Okabe texts this information to his hacker friend Daru ( he's a hentai) he experiences a timeline switch and end up in world line Alpha, after several bad events Okabe decides to return to Beta ASAP, rest of season is about Okabe trying to return to world line Beta experiencing pain, friendship and love, exploring people hidden personalities and secrets.
Story progression: 9/10
Main storyline only, even though story is happening within 14 days it is NOT boring. Whenever Okabe alters the Alpha line with D-Mail ( sending message to past) a bit it brings changes, for example when Okabe saves Rumiho's ( rich nyan nyan girl, even though she's rich she enjoys working in normal cafe) father, the entire city changes it's face and soul. Story progresses in perfect pace.
S;G season 1 doesn't have any villain so I am not gonna include that category.
Sound: 9/10
Soundtracks and melodies fits S;G style perfectly, it is fitting modern era.
So overall rating of Steins;Gate is 9/10 exact ( in my heart it's 10/10). S;G is an unique anime with unique storyline, I've absolutely enjoyed it and I think there won't be any anime that will beat it.",9

                I've just watched episodes 20-22 as of writing this post. My tears have mostly dried now, and I thought I'd try writing my first review here on MAL on an anime that has really taken me on an emotional roller coaster ride.
I often just assume time-travel stories are going to be complicated. Like... I'll have to keep track of differences after a character has traveled and changed something. So when I first heard of Steins;Gate, I misjudged it as a serious anime, something that would take a lot of work to watch.
I was wrong.
First drawn to it because of the seiyuus, I gave this anime
                  a shot.
The pacing is great---not too fast or rushed for a majority of the episodes. We receive information like backstory and some explanations in a timely manner---no large info-dumps.
Some of the relationships are established ahead of time, but we're given plenty of time to develop favorites... time to actually care about this characters. There are some really moving moments in this show. Prepare to have your eyes at least water up.
The characters are fantastic, although only a couple of them are explored thoroughly. The character we learn the least about is Daru, which isn't a loss, but still noteworthy... as nothing works without him.
There's a moment when a key bit of information is glossed over by the person this key bit of info GREATLY affects. I mean, she finds out anyway, but I would've preferred that she not have remembered for that brief second and then forget completely.
Anyway, this review really has nothing new to add. I understand why this show is so loved and considered a masterpiece. I've watched in time for Steins;Gate 0, however well that will turn out. I hope it doesn't disappoint, because Steins;Gate was an incredible show.",10

                This is an amazing anime no doubt. Outstanding story and unbelievably unique characters that will stay with you forever. Unbelievably strong character development and plot structure. This is one of those anime's that you could easily re-watch the early episodes and every time you do you will end up connecting more dots - ""oh, so that's why that happened! I get it now!"", you will think to yourself.
The first 11 episodes are slow paced but for a reason. Don't give up watching because the early episodes are necessary to set the context for the outstanding story that follows. If you stick with this anime past
                  the midpoint, you will not regret it. Episode 12 is where the action starts and from there the action doesn't stop until the end.
Okarin, the main character, is amazing in the English Dub. You will laugh with him, cry with him, and feel with him throughout his journey. Some characters seem annoying at first, but they grow on you too, so be patient. Honestly, everything about this anime is unique; the characters are unique, the plot is unique, the writing is unique; it's unlike anything I've ever seen before and that is what makes it so wonderful.
One of the best anime's I have ever seen.
If you are looking for a compelling story and strong character development, look no further.",10
"
                Story: First of all the beginning can be a bit boring and confusing but i promise you it'll get 
           x100 better as you continue. The storyline pulls you in each episode and makes you 
          think and see things that will blow your mind. i was about to either drop or put this 
          anime on hold but considering the rating i thought maybe im not getting something. But    as i continue it gets better and better. it gives you a rollercoaster of emotions.
Art: there's nothing special and it is decent.
Sound: nothing special and is decent
Character: the character is phenomenal and the character development is amazing. there were some clips where the characters act like any generic characters but overall its fantastic.
another thing i like to add is that the VA sometimes felt a bit off like the scene is intense but their voice didnt really match the situation but its only a minor thing.
overall this anime is fantastically made and is instantly my top 3",10

                An awesome story that reminded me often of Terminator and a bit of Doctor Who.  I really admire the protagonist's carefree attitude but deep loyalty and love for his friends.  He's very quirky and unique and says a lot of quotable lines.  He is someone I'd be glad to call my friend if he existed in real life.  Besides the main guy, the entire cast is really lovable and the show does a great job showcasing small subtleties in reactions.  The show depicts rather believably how anyone would react to the situations they go through which makes the characters really
                  relatable so I found myself always cheering them on.  The show ends neatly and the length is just perfect, the plot doesn't drag!",9
"
                Well first things first. This anime is definitely one that I would recommend. I very much enjoyed this anime and I would definitely watch it again. That's the one thing i'm sure about. What i'm having a hard time deciding is whether I should vote this a 9/10 (excellent) or a 10/10 (masterpiece, which seems to be the most popular vote according to Anime News Network). I'll give it credit, you don't see an anime like this every day. Time travel, various scientific theories and formulas, a very well articulated and spoken protagonist :P (I watched the dub) It was a very well thought out
                  series. I loved just about all of the characters, which is quite rare for me. I'm also very much a fan of anything that starts off comedic but ends up very serious and/or dark. It's one of those anime where once the real story kicks in it's hard to stop watching.
But on the other hand, while the concept of time travel is very interesting, it's not really masterpiece material by itself. A real masterpiece anime, for me, has to have some kind of reoccurring concept or solutions to problems that i would've never thought of. The way Steins Gate portrayed and carried out the idea of time travel was in a way that I'm already familiar with. So none of the solutions were really mind blowing. Of course this doesn't make it any less enjoyable.
To avoid spoilers i'll just be a bit vague about what really docked it points for me. Not sure if i misunderstood this part of the ending or not but to me it felt kind of weird to have like 70% of the anime, sort of discounted. Apparently none of that needed to happen. It was all just to rile Okabe up enough to do the things he did during the last few episodes. Like 21 episodes was all build up for 3 episodes? It just seemed a bit off to me.
I might, very well, just be getting nitpiky with it, but...There's just something about a real masterpiece anime (to my definition) that I can feel. And I didn't feel it in this anime. Of course this was still a GREAT anime that is well worth the watch. It's just at this moment it doesn't appear to be a flawless masterpiece in my eyes. I think i'd give it a good 9/10, which is still a very very good rating.",9
"
                (From watching the anime only-- I haven't tried the visual novel)
It was only during my second attempt that I finally finished Steins;Gate. I quit by episode 6 the first time. For the second time, I was only hooked around episode 8. Indeed, I needed a tremendous amount of patience to get through the first few episodes. 
The first half of the anime lays down the foundation for the story but it would also mean being bombarded with a ton of questions which will remain unanswered until the second half. It is for this reason that sometimes it can be frustrating to watch but at the
                  same time the payoff is immensely satisfying when you reach the final episode. Compared to my struggle to finish episodes 1-8, my excitement to finish the story was easily seen when I devoured episodes 9 onwards in one sitting.
I find that with Steins;Gate the strength of the animation can be seen more in its cinematography than the character design. However, I do appreciate that it never (or rarely, if at all) employed having the characters make typical typical silly/funny anime expressions. It lends a tone of seriousness which fits well with the anime's theme. It doesn't make it pretentious; on the contrary, everything actually seems more real when done that way.
Its sound isn't truly distracting or awful. If referring to VAs, I don't really know much to comment. I'll just say it was okay.
To wrap up this review: Steins;Gate is a great show, but it tortured me a lot. Was it worth it though? Yes, definitely! When I finished the anime, I found myself going back to the earlier episodes and watched them again in a different light.",9
"
                Ah, Steins;Gate. Hailed by many as the greatest sci-fi anime of all time, and narrowly missing out on the best anime of all time, period, only because of FMAB. Most reviewers will praise the ""brilliancy"" of the plot and plot twists, the great characters, and, most of all, the ""absolutely perfect"" way time travel is handled. 
When I finally succumbed to the pressure and watched Steins;Gate, I found that my patience was being sorely tested. I wanted revelations that would change my entire worldview; an ingenious interpretation of the concept of time; but most of all, I just wanted to enjoy myself. 
First, the plot
                  (slight spoilers for the first half ahead). A team of eccentric scientists invent a time machine able to send messages to the past, and their careless use of time travel alters the present and forces them to try and find a timeline with a better future. I was told the first 10 episodes or so would be slow, so I hung on. But by episode 15, something was wrong. It seemed that the point where the pace and drama was supposed to kick in went completely over my head. In hindsight, I realized that I had predicted most of the plot twists, and some surprised me but left no impact. With the suspense factor gone, the show dragged on until I could bear it no longer and stopped at episode 20. 
The greatest asset of the show is, no doubt, the characters. They are human, each of them quirky and unique, which make them interesting and likable. I won't go into too much detail here, but the characters are simply awesome.
Now, the time travel. Does any show that uses time travel logically automatically make it a masterpiece? No, of course not. Time travel is a tool; it should supplement the plot and change the characters. Yes, Steins;Gate does use time travel in a way that actually makes sense, which is more than can be said for many other similar shows. However, it doesn't introduce anything groundbreaking or even remotely thought-provoking. Multiverse theory already exists; and ""the past affects the present"" is a very fundamental part of time that doesn't say anything new. The discovery of time travel changes the characters by making them realize the true dangers of altering the past, but in the end, Steins;Gate didn't make me ask questions about reality or change much about my thinking at all. 
With the ""depth"" of the show gone, combined with the lack of suspense due to predictability and the disappointment of such a highly rated show not nearly living up to its hype, I can only give Steins;Gate a 6/10.",6
"
                I can see why Steins;Gate is one of the most beloved anime of our day, but I cannot deny that it was overall underwhelming. The visual side of things was great: I love seeing an original art style, and the animation was very good in quality too. The characters were well-written and well-acted too. The problem is the plot surrounding all of that, however. It did not feel coherent, it did not draw me in, it simply failed at doing what an anime should do. 
I would say that Steins;Gate is a good anime, but in my eyes it simply doesn't deserve a 9+ rating.
                  6 may be a point too harsh, but it is where I stand.",6
"
                Steins;Gate is an absolute masterpiece from it's interesting characters in which none of them feel dull in the slightest and it's complex story. In most people's reviews I see them say that it starts slow which is true but it builds up the characters and lets you get to know them before major things happen in the story so it makes it much more impactful when you know the characters. The art style I love but the coloring I feel was a bit off. While I was watching it felt like all the colors were faded but that's just how it looked. The soundtrack is
                  amazing my favorite track was definitely Skyclad Observer but you won't find a single track that is bad in this anime. Overall Steins;Gate is a masterpiece and I don't think anyone can change that from my perspective. I recommend this anime for anyone and that's what makes it special.",10
"
                Story: 10/10
The first one or two episodes may seem a little confusing when Kurisu died and somehow she came back alive. This confusing plot and the weirdness of Okabe might put you off from continuing the series. After a few more episodes, that is when the story gets good. The theory about parallel worlds may not be an original idea, but they have demonstrated it very nicely in this anime. It took me a while to understand the logic behind parallel universes because the idea was new to me. It was slightly confusing for me at first but once you understand it, it becomes really
                  good. The story is quite serious, but Okabe's weirdness makes it less serious and more interesting to watch. Before watching the ending, I was very curious as to how it will end. I had many thoughts about it, but it still surprised me. The story was not predictable for me at all.
Art: 9/10
The colours are quite dark and dull and it suits the thriller and mysterious themes. The art style is very consistent through out the series. Sometimes I find some of the character's face a little bit off proportion, maybe it is just the style, but I did not like that. What I do like is the dark and suspense feeling it gives me when I watch it.
Sound: 9/10
When I first heard the opening song, it was very catchy. And all the other songs and soundtracks that appeared in the anime are all very good. I also love the clock ticking and cricket sounds at the start of the anime. It had really set out the atmosphere. The character's voices are very good. I especially love Okabe's laugh. 
Characters: 10/10
The different characters in the anime has a different atmosphere and makes this anime really interesting to watch. It is not just one plain thriller and sic-fi anime. Obake Rintarou adds weirdness and craziness, Shinna Mayuri gives some childish feelings and Makise Kurisu is the serious one. If they did not have these characters with diverse personalities, I think it would be boring. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
I enjoyed Steins;Gate a lot and it has been a while since I have found such a good anime to watch. But I do not think Steins;Gate would be a great anime to watch for people who have just gotten into anime. I think the people who will enjoy this anime the most are the people who have been watching anime for a long time. I have watched Steins;Gate twice because it is just so good. I would love to buy the DVD box set if I had the money because I love this anime. 
Overall: 10/10
I highly recommend you to watch Steins;Gate. It will change your point of view about this world. I have also learnt a lot about parallel universes and other science theories because I looked them up on google after hearing about it in Steins;Gate.

                If there‚Äôs Any Show in the Planet Which Can Explain You About Time Travel there‚Äôs no Better Show then Steins;Gate
After watching Okabe Rintarou suffering, now I am quite afraid of time traveling (if Possible) everything was explained properly if you are interested in Time traveling I highly recommend you watching this Anime
‚ÄúNo one knows what the future holds. That‚Äôs why its potential is infinite.‚Äù
Okabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)
This anime made me laugh maniacally and cry silently. It also made me think, and it rewarded my thoughts by having closure and clarity, which left me more than satisfied. Easily a 10/10 anime, and now one of my favorites
                  that I've seen!",10
"
                Characters make brief Star Trek references in the dub, so giving this show a 9 is practically a requirement. 
But more importantly, this show does its best to keep me interested despite being about time travel. While many show try to explain their science too much or not enough, Steins;Gate strikes a workable balance in order to keep the human elements of the story engaging. It gives you just what you need to follow the story. Those who like to keep tabs on background details early on in the show are immensely rewarded as these details come into play over and over again. There isn't
                  much in the show that isn't necessary to tell the story.
The colors and directing set a strong tone. The half-craziness of the protagonist helps set up an early mini-mystery for the audience as to whether he is an unreliable narrator or not. I don't think this show would've been nearly as great otherwise; the audience needs to be just as skeptical as Okabe's friends in each scene in order to really sell the character. While they don't keep this going on for the whole show, it does help get the viewer through the admittedly-slower first half of the series.
The only reason why I can't give this story a 10 is because of the cultural tool used to make the characters relatable: one of the centerpiece themes of the show is that all the characters are otaku of various sorts. Not just nerds or geeks like in Big Bang Theory, but straight-up chuunibyo delinquents or waifu-loving dorks. While a character in an american show being obsessed with Batman is a universally understood kind of nerd that transcends generations, I feel like the characters' interests and lingo in Steins;Gate will heavily date it in due time. It is ultimately forgivable however since almost all science geeks are nerds in some sort of fashion, and the story does take place in what I'd like to call a watering hole for otaku.",9

                Story
Rintaro Okabe, aka ‚ÄúKyouma Hououin‚Äù is at the Akihabara Radio Kaikan building to attend a seminar about time travel. He is there with his lab member 002, Mayuri. While in the seminar, he realizes that Doctor Nakabachi has plagiarized someone else‚Äôs work and decides to speak up about it right there, disrupting the seminar. Kurisu Makise a woman of unknown origin then pulls him out to talk about what he wanted to say 15 minutes ago to her. The catch is that he‚Äôs never met her before, and this is where episode 1 really started to make zero sense for me. Later in the episode
                  he finds Kurisu dead, freaking out he goes to send a text to Daru aka lab member 003. When he does, he teleports through time, and later finds out that the text he sent went 7 days into the past. After all this he finds Kurisu alive. Unable to grasp what he is seeing Okabe goes on a mission to understand how this happened and, to decipher the secrets of Sern.
when it comes to the animation it may not be the flashiest slickest anime to come out and It may not be the greatest animation you‚Äôve ever seen, but it certainly stands out amongst its contemporaries. Hair glistens in the sunlight, facial expressions are subtly affecting, colors are vibrant but not loud, and everything has a generally sleek, clean, polished look to it. What stands out about Steins;Gate‚Äôs animation is its subtlety ‚Äì of colors, of character designs, and in the fluidity of motion. It‚Äôs a style that works perfectly with the tone of the series, and though it may not be as impressive as something like Attack on Titan, it‚Äôs just as effective in communicating emotion and drawing the viewer into a space that feels habitable.
Sound
The sound and music are great. At first the music seemed kind of dry, but as I progressed through the story, I became more attached to the soundtrack and opening. I play it in the car and during gaming sometimes now.
Characters
The characters and character dialogue are extremely well done. I was able to relate with each character in different scenes. Each one has unique personalities and they all flow so well together it makes your heart warm. This anime has the best character diversity I‚Äôve ever seen! to some characters being innocent and sweet to to being awkward and creepy but nether the less they are all enjoyable in their ow way throughout the series
Overall 
this series is definitely a must watch if your looking for something wholesome",10

                I was eager to jump into this anime since is the type of animes that I enjoy. Although I think this anime was spectacular, I will mention the flaws it had. Steins Gate is not action packed but the story is so great that you don't care about that all you care about is the story and the characters. 
Story- The story is actually simple, you would think that time travel would be complicated but is not. It starts out pretty slow and by episode 7 that's when it starts getting interesting because that's when they start experimenting on the time machine. Fromt there on,
                  it just got better and better and I do mean better. The story was just too great I got hooked on it real fast. When an episode was done I just quickly went into the other one, that's how great it was. 
Art- Pretty good, nothing special.
Sound- good sound editing and great theme song, really liked it.
Character- They were all great. I liked all of them because you feel the chemistry with them really fast. The connection is there and you can tell. Very well done with the character development, well processed. Liked the protagonist, he was very funny the way he talked, he was a joy to watch made me laugh a lot and of course Mayuri, she was very sweet and adorable, there is no way you can hate a person like that.
Enjoyment- Great time I had with this anime that for sure, great story that started a little slow but got better as it goes along and great chemistry between each character that you feel the friendship is real and not bullshit. This anime is great and it has my stamp of aproval. I recommend this anime to all anime fans.",9
"
                Really well executed time travel narrative.  Probably one of the best I've ever seen.  It isn't perfect(there are some logical inconsistencies) but I think it captures the emotions well.  I also like quite a few of the characters and the art is very attractive.
But as someone with a strong aversion to cringe (especially chuunibyou) and delusional conspiracy theorist pandering I found Okabe insufferable and the second quarter of the series distasteful (in that order), which dragged down on my enjoyment of it.  
This series is quite good and I did enjoy watching it despite that, but it definitely isn't for me,
                  it was carried by the 2chan and 4chan demographic. So while there's all the makings of a truly great(10/10) show, for me it's merely ""good"".",7
"
                Pros:
great artwork
funny
Hot girls (couldn't watch more than 1-2 episodes at a time before having myself a wank)
Mentally stimulating
Cons:pretty redundant story line
Repetitive
trite at times
Pretty neat time travel anime (nothing exciting like far into the future or past) that opens your mind and makes you take a different perspective on life. Unfortunately, half the show consists of them changing things, and the other half is them changing it back.
You will watch them travel back 5 hours into the past nearly 100 times so it can get repetitive. Chicks are pretty cute. Don't have the big titties like in High School of the Dead, but more realistic looking and cute/sensual girls.
I'd recommend this anime.",7
"
                10/10.
If you are into shounen or moe steins gate is not the show for you, but if you want to get invested in an amazing sci fi, time travel story steins gate is the best of the best.
This show spends the first 12 episodes to get you to bond with the characters and after that the story fully starts. Some people might find that 12 episodes is dragging out the show alot but these 12 episodes are really necessary. So you must give steins gate a bit of time and trust me the end result is worth it.
The main character of steins gate Okabe is
                  one of the better developed main characters i have seen in sci fi, when he goes through pain you feel for him and when he suceeds you feel accomplished, the bond he has with the rest of the characters is what makes Okabe an amazing character.
Overall this show just works, every time you rewatch it you will find things that you missed on previous watches since the detail and plot developed so well.
I recommend steins gate for anyone willing to get invested in amazing characters.",10
"
                This show really surprised me. I can honestly say this is up there in my top 5 at least and I've watched well over one-hundred anime shows. 
Summary: In my opinion, this is the finest sci-fi anime I've ever watched, and it manages to have excellent characters, development, and a story that keeps you guessing to boot!
Story: 10/10
I really don't want to say much here because one of the reasons I enjoyed this anime so much was that I couldn't guess the plot exactly. It kept me guessing until the end. The anime starts off as a happy quirky anime that could almost be a
                  bizarre slice of life following a socially awkward wannabe mad-scientist. You keep meeting interesting characters. Their jokes and interaction are hilarious. This is one of the few shows I would recommend the funimation dub if you are english because they did such a phenomenal job translating the jokes and dialogue. It is hilarious and on-point! If you don't like quirky happy anime, just stick with it, the show takes a dark unexpected dive mid-season and then it is a wild ride of emotions and guessing until the end. 
As you've probably heard, the main subject is time-travel and the perspective on it is well-developed and the science interesting as well. If you are a scientist like me and love sci-fi, you have probably been disappointed with the anime sci-fi genre. It really is bad and the science is treated as a magical box or brushed over. Not in this show! You'll see flaws in the director's knowledge, but they did a great job as far as anime are concerned really trying to talk out the details as the characters go through their journey of excitement, discovery, despair, etc. Really phenomenal second half of the season. The one thing you might be disappointed in is the ending. But I really can't say why that might be. I want to keep from spoiling how things develop for you new viewers! :) 
Art: 8/10
The art really is not that special. There are very few intense action scenes, as I said previously it is animated like a Slice of Life anime, but somehow I just found it incredibly endearing. The way the characters use quirkiness and expressiveness, gestures, poses, etc. It really works well and adds a perfect accent to the comedy parts of the anime. And the intro sequence is unique and interesting.
Sound: 8/10
I like the intro sequence and sound a lot. It really sets the tone. The voice-acting is also superb, in both the funimation dub and the original. The funimation crew made an excellent english dub that I highly recommend if you struggle with subbed. It is very well done and on-point, translating the jokes and the humor perhaps even better then the original for me. 
Character: 10/10
I rarely give 10/10 for character development because anime typically is bad at it. They are short and episodic. It's hard to do well. But the character development here is incredible. Nearly every character you really meet is developed and fully 3D by the end. (not counting background like when they are out walking). the main cast of lab characters especially so. I loved seeing Okabe crack, break, and grow when the action goes down and Cristina (not her real name, you'll see) is one of my favorite female characters in anime. She's strong, smart, and well-balanced. Okabe is one of my favorite male characters too. 
I can't really go into more detail without major spoilers as the plot is not easy to guess or stereotypical. (besides maybe the very ending but I did like how it was done) The plot and characters and the development/pacing is just really good in the second half and the humor is really good in the first half. The rare combination of good elements brought it up to an extremely rare ""10/10"" for me. 
Please watch! This anime is really great! :D",10

                ""Time is the longest distance between two places""
Looking at the hype and high rating of the anime, steins gate really took me to a highest expectation possible. After finishing the whole series, steins gate has become top 5 of my favourite anime of all time and the best sci-fi theme anime i've ever watch. A combination of time travel, ambiguity of the life we living now, uncertain future and the effort of human being to go through the past using any methods as possible, and the reference to one of the top conspiracy theories ever ""John Titor"" really elevate the whole series. 
You may imagine
                  a top intelligent and overall a hard thinking needed to understand the whole series, but its actually has been packed in a easy and warm story with all the characters complimenting the overall science fiction theme involving the science knowledge. It is an unique anime and quite brave to bring up the theme that quite taboo in our social system: trying to change the time and event through certain method in the form of time machine. Twist after twist, thrilling sequence, magical and romantic moment, the warm daily conversation, and the overall development of the story and the character is enough to lift up the series into another level and its really fulfil all the high expectation
Art&Story: 9/10
Not the best art around for an 2010s anime, some people say its quite uncomfortable to watch, but i found it quite well crafted even though its not came with the highest budget-graphic here and around. However, what i think is the main strong aspect that making steins gate sets the bar high for any future sci-fi anime is the story. Honestly, looking at the first 5-10 episode of the series will get you bored that you want to dropped the series, BUT you need to wait until above episode 11 where everything went darker, thrilling, and overall more interesting, and the last 10 episode of the series has elevate steins gate into the steins gate we know today: one of the top rated anime in whole MAL and overall the most popular sci-fi anime. 
The pace is quite well-put although you have to embrace the first 5 episode to love and know deeply about the main character Okabe Rintarou and his relation with other character and lab member, especially if you love a tsundere-type of anime girl, Makise Kurisu as one of the main will be on the top of your favourite anime character ever. Many people compare steins gate theory and science reference to real-world science but personally i think is just an anime and therefore the level of accuracy can't be too high and this was just made for pure entertainment. Story is amazing and will keep you on the edge of your seat
Character: 10/10
One of the main reason steins gate plot is running well is because of the character. Okabe Rintarou and Makise Kurisu who become main protagonist on this anime came with some beautiful, funny, crazy, and sometimes romantic moment that will make you forget that this is a sci-fi anime. All the characters revolving around these 2 is also compliment the series with their each of them uniquness, less character compare to other anime but this is what make us know them deeper and feel closer and related to each of the character. Chemistry of the character is also a top notch and each of them has proper screening time within the anime. The dialogue and conversation of the characters feel real and not forced either, and the jokes too, even though some of the jokes can be too hard to handle but it is really making the series become more interesting. Character development is also amazing and you can expect a drastical change from your favourite character
Sound: 10/10
I love al the OST and the backsound throguhout the series. Main theme and ending song is amazing, beautiful, and goes well with the series. No complains, just amazing. Great job to all the composer who work so hard in creating sound and song that fits the series incredibly well
Originality of the story & Enjoyment: 9/10
I really enjoy the series, but its only after episode 10. The first 10 episode got me bored so bad and i even fell asleep in the middle of the episode, but so glad that i choose to stay and can finished the whole series (and the sequel, too) in just 2 days. The level of enjoyment is rocket high after the first 10 episode. Story is also one of a kind and something that i never see before in an anime, and its enough to bring steins gate to the place they're currently now",9

                For me, plot and character development are what makes or breaks almost all forms of entertainment.  Steins;Gate implores both of these elements with such intensity and profound curiosity it is almost unimaginable.  The plot is rather complex and can become confusing at times if one was not paying attention.  This only makes this series that much more enjoyable for me.  Because of the plot's mannerisms it  character development can be equally tricky to follow until one has a complete grasp of the plot.
Both voice acting and dialogue play a paramount role throughout this animation.  Meaningful dialogue enhances the plot
                  and character development while the voice acting makes Steins;Gate even more enjoyable.  Everything else hardly matter to me.  This is not to say that if other elements such as sound quality, animation, and artistic appeal were to be removed or changed that the series would remain unaffected.  But, more so a complement to a plot that was so enthralling that I hardly noticed the expertise put into these categories.  Of these, voice acting is one of the more easily noticeable.
Stein;Gate is one of the best anime series I have ever had the pleasure of watching.  There is hardly a show I have found to be more intense and utterly engulfing than this show.  I watched all 24 episodes within a 48 hour period and loved every minute of it.",10
"
                Ever since I started watching anime, it has almost always felt a little different to hollywood movies. It may have been the themes, the execution, or maybe just the concepts. But seeing this anime might have given me an answer. At least in the horror genre (I don't know if steins;gate would be in the horror genre, ut anyway)
This review will contain spoilers for the anime (and maybe re:zero), so please proceed with cautions.
Let's compare steins;gate to a show that was very similar. That being Re:zero. 
If you have seen re:zero and steins;gate, you know how similar they are. Yes, there are different themes and
                  characters. But the general story was pretty similar in my opinon. But the biggest difference I saw between the story of steins;gate and re:zero was how it handeled the horror aspects. We get to see how the main characters get to experience very traumatic events over and over again. But where steins;gates horror comes kind of naturally, it felt like re:zero felt the need to have shock factor be a part of the horror. 
You wouldn't expect horror themes in a cute video game world where there are cute girls and you get to save the world. So when you see those horrific scenes, you get shocked. 
Now, I'm not saying that re:zero is a bad anime. It wasn't great, but pretty good in my opinion. But it's a good example of how animes (that I have seen) usually show horror.
But when I saw Steins;gate, it really reminded me of how many western horror movies use horror. At least good ones.
Another thing it reminded me of was how alien set up the movie. Both alien and steins;gate have very long set ups. Steins;gate has 12 episodes of (some would say) boring set up. Alien also has a lot of time to set up the characters and the story. So even though their stories are very different, you can see many similarities. 
Though, there were things I felt like would have been interesting to see in the story. They touch on the subject of the morality of going back in time, but I would have liked to see it more. Cause Okarin (the main character) goes back in time so many times, and at one point it feels a little wrong. Is it really right to change what was supposed to happen. But the only time they adress this is with one single dialogue that doesn't change the story at all. But please, educate me if you disagree. 
Some of the dialogue also felt a little cheap. telling the audiance things that could be told more subtely. The first episode had this problem the most in my opinion. 
So even though most of the dialogue was very good, the bad ones stick with me easier.
But my favorite part of the show was probably the characters. Most of the characters felt very realistic, likeable and interesting. They all react differently to the horrific events of the story, which was interesting. Though, a few of the characters felt mostly like jokes or very extreme. Daru felt like a one-sided otaku with no life at all. His personality wasn't very interesting either.
So to me, this show was a -9 to me",9
"
                Steins;Gate is one of the best told sci fi stories I've ever seen. It's widely regarded as one of the best anime of the decade and I absolutely agree with that. Honestly, the only thing that I didn't like about it the first time around was the slow start, but when I look back on the series, the slow start was pretty necessary for the rest of the story. When it gets going, it gets going. It's the best time travel story out there. It's about an eccentric scientist trying to discover time travel. The characters are some of my favorites. Especially the main character,
                  Okabe Rintaro. He's one of my favorite characters in any show ever. Not only is he fun to watch, but he gets to these points where he's more than a fun character, he's a fascinating person.
The original Steins;Gate is one of the greatest anime ever made. There is a movie to continue it, but I personally didn't think it did a very good job at capturing what made the show so great.
There's also a sequel to an alternate ending called Steins;Gate 0 and well... I'll get to that one when I get to it.",10
"
                This is by far my favorite anime of all time, I love anime where you follow a group of weirdos around as they do there usual hijinks (cowboy bebop & samurai Champloo for example) it honestly makes me smile, while rewatchimg it 3 years after my first viewing and I still smile as rintaro interacts with the rest of the cast, its like leaving a group of friends behind then coming back after with what seems like forever and being happy that there the same as how you left them.
If your looking for a good time this is anime for you, if your looking for
                  a serious story with a lovable cast, this is your anime and I can't wait to see what comes of this series.",10
"
                Steins gate is one of the storys i enjoyed allot. 
It has a great story that can be pretty mind bending, but thats what makes it so good.
 i also liked their art/music style it realy fitted with the characters/story  giving some realy good vibes. 
the characters are realy well balanced from cute girls to mad scientists, creating some funny and tense moments. 
thanks to all those points i think for now this will be my favorite anime's,
and will get a overal ranking of 10 from.  me its an outstanding anime 
you wont be able to find one thats quite similar to this
                  one.
so i realy reccomend watching this  especialy if you like mind bending storys.

                Steins;Gate is a new twist on an old and worn out use of time travel. The concept they used added a more mature concept to it as the characters weren't just some high school brats who were smart but were young adults who explained in detail what they were doing and how they had to be responsible for it. The art was amazing espacially when it was a time travel sequnce and saw the ridges of time. The sound was ok for the most part but at times when Okane slipped into french and english accents and way's of speaking it just killed whatever mood
                  was developing. The character developement was simply out standing. Because in a certain way a harem developes but isn't really pointed out except for joke, but instead of just introducing a character with a whole episode and then just kinda adding them later on ,they managed to sneak the character in so you already know them and slightly give you clues until their time came which was certainly better then anything i've ever seen before. Overall the series is a masterpiece that really can't be argued other wise.",10
"
                Steins;Gate is one of the greatest sci-fi animes out there and the one that truly masters time traveling part. I'll give it the most accurate score. 
Story-10/10
The story to Steins;Gate is basically about these lab members making a time traveling microwave machine and basically to save Mayuri from the organization and to prevent Kurisu's death. 
Art-8/10 
The art is good but not really the best that I've seen in anime 
Sound-9/10
The soundtrack is decent and the opening and ending themes are really great 
Character-10/10 
I'm not going to go into detail but basically the first 10 episodes is basically about character development.
Enjoyment- 6/10 
I'm not going to sit here and say that I enjoyed all of the episodes of steins;gate because I actually didn't but that doesn't mean it's a bad show. The first 11 episodes were really slow paced but the last few episodes does pay off.
Overall-8/10
This is probably the most accurate score that i can give to Steins;Gate because the rest of the reviews are giving 10/10 like if it was really enjoyable and perfect. Steins;Gate is good but it's not a masterpiece as people in MAL say.",8

                This review contains spoilers, especially about the ending!
Steins;Gate is an anime attempting at time-traveling however the pace of the show was crawlingly unbearable. The setting of the story was incredibly slow, the emotional impact could have been achieved with much lesser episodes. Episodes 23-25 also was encouraged to watch after completing Steins;Gate 0 which was really annoying. Forcing the viewers to finish another season before giving them a sense of closure otherwise it wouldn't make much sense. Though the storytelling pace was really slow, the build-up to the finale didn't disappoint me. I could understand why many people gave such a high rating to it
                  just because of how well the story ended. 
There were many parts of the story where I expected plot twists because the clues were awfully obvious. Other than the MC I found the other characters having little character development and they were pretty much stale after a backstory. With only the time travel as the main plot, other side development was boring and a waste of time since they get reset anyway. I wouldn't recommend watching Steins;Gate unless you have nothing else to watch.",5
"
                I partially edited this review to make it less generic and improve it. I Will update it again furtherly(19/10/2021).
THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW
Steins;Gate follows the events of the self-proclaimed ""mad scientist"" Rintarou Okabe, a young but brilliant student who, with the company of his friends Itaru and Mayuri, create a device to sent messages back in the past. This device allows the user to make change from the past, influencing the course of the events until the present.
Thanks to this premise, the story is set up and will follow our crew embark in a journey of doing/undoing/redoing the past, and therefore, the present.
I already
                  had good expectations, but I didn't imagine it would evolve like this. Because evolution it's one of the strongest point of the show, probably of the best example of how to handle the climax of a story. The first episodes has lots of jokeful scenes and humour, but the more the plot goes forward, the more the plot deepens and becomes mature. The mood gradually turns from comedic to thrilling and dramatic, with some peak scenes that are extremely moving and cathartic. This end up in an amazing plot, in which all pieces eventually fit perfectly like a puzzle. A story that deserves my 10.
Through the course of the series, new characters will be constantly added, increasing the complexity of the plot. Even if I expected a bit more realistic reactions by characters in some cases, I found the well written, both in term of characterization of the single ones and in terms of relationship between them. About the latter, a honorable mention goes to the love story, which I think is one of the best in anime. 8 For the characters.
I wasn't amazed by the opening theme at the beginning, but eventually I get affectioned to it. I don't have any particular complaint to the soundtrack, the design and the graphics looks solid to me. In general I haven't found significant flaws in the artistic and sound production, so I give this an 8. (When I wrote this review for the first time, this rating was more an impression, I might justify it better after a rewatch.
The absence of useless episodes, the perfect pacing and the well-deserved and satisfying ending combined with all the emotional aspects made my personal enjoyment worth a 10.
So overall I think 9 it's a fair score, one of the best anime with a few flaws in it, but not that far from the status of masterpiece.",9
"
                The review does not contain any spoilers...
Steins;Gate is without doubt one of the best anime of all time. Everything about the show is so fresh and unique. It feels really good to see animation explore unique parts besides flashy stories that have become too generic over time. 
The story revolves around the *mad scientist"" Okabe Rintatou aka Hyouyin Kyouma. This character, my friends, is one of the most well-written characters in anime history along with his lab members but more on that later. Coming on to the story, it revolves around a rarely explored time travel phenomena. The story itself is good and bring up
                  interesting theories about the phenomena of time travel but what makes it excellent is the interactions between all the characters that help it unfold. Towards the middle is filled with dark drama and even handles romance well, too. There are so many amazing plot twists that the story is constantly evolving. Ever heard of a sc-fi humor anime with dark drama and romance? The mix may seem somewhat irrevalant but it only adds layer to the depth of the plot. The plot is never dragged out and always intrigues the viewer to the point that we genuinely begin to care about our characters.
Speaking of characters, I mentioned already that they are the best ever written. The characters NEVER feel generic because each have their own sense of uniqueness to them: from the adorable Mayuri to the genius tsundere Makisu. Their interactins are always fun to watch and often I found myself grinning to the point I looked creepy (like  the Cheshire  cat).
The humor of the show is derived from the dialogue and verbal interactions from these characters without ever relying on the comical expressions that the anime industry is famous for overusing. So they are likable to the point you will want to BECOME like them, whether you say ""Tutturu~"" throughout the day or pretend to call your ""organization"". Honestly I have never seen an anime with a main protagonist as likable as Steins;Gate's. Thats why the show makes you feel truly connected to these characters and can't help but make you show satisfaction or sorrow over them. I also gotta hand it over to the sieyuu for their incredible portrayals that fleshes out the characters even more. and oh yeah......WATCH THE SUB!!!
The art of the show is nothing new or amazing but it has well-drawn backgrounds and the same art style is consistent throughout the series, so you don't have to fawn over degrading art quality which long runing series series are notorious for.
The soundtrack of Steins; Gate is rarely ever used, only in some particular dramatic moments. The opening and ending songs are great and have some catchy music to hum to.
Overall, the 25 episodes of the show are a wild scientific ride that will never bore the viewers and these are kept intact by likable characters and their interactions. The show is pretty light-hearted though it does get dark somewhere around the middle. But it only makes you want to stick along for the journey, and at the end it leaves off on a satisfying note.
Overall, this is one of the best anime productions to ever exist. You will certainly want to see more of these characters when you're done with the show but there's Steins;Gate 0 coming for that.üòâ GET ON THE HYPE TRAIN!!!!!

                Subtle spoilers ahead, while may not be huge or very vague spoilers, do so at your own risks.
Steins Gate, a sci fi anime series based on time travel and to a certain extent real life scenarios. A anime that stayed near or in the top 3 rated animes of this website for years and maybe perhaps years to come too. I'll say this off the bat, it was a nice show the first time I watched albeit years ago, but my re-watch of this show recently and the addition of Zero has changed my opinions of Steins Gate as a overall series, for the better,
                  and rightfully so. However because this is just specifically for the original series, we will not involve zero or connect anything from zero to this review, even if it fills the gap this series has, as in the end the material does not come from this show, moving on. 
I'm not gonna be one of those people that say Steins Gate is a masterpiece without flaw and that everything stated in this ""masterpiece"" was a fabulous and ingenious idea, diving into the convention of time travel theories and quantums already asks for inconsistencies and flawed detail no matter how you put it, because simply, there is no definitive answer. I'm not one of those people to just claim this is the best show of all time just because, even though it is my favourite show, taste are a thing and way too diverse to be able to judge the ""perfect"" and definitive best anime. However, what i will say, is that it was a absolute blast to watch, at times, even when I re-watched it was at times confusing to watch, and moreover, it was at times incredibly painful and somber to watch. This show pulls on your emotions so strong that you feel like you're tied with hundreds of ropes, pulling at your feelings. Depending on your connection with the characters, more on that later, you will feel outright heartbroken and hurt. That is how strong Steins Gate has resonated with me as a whole, I just loved the way this anime was made. Now the most spoken flaw of this series is the slow pacing, the first ten episodes to be exact, where many people who watched this show feel like it's just a filler, un-needed or time spent on something way too slow that should be spend elsewhere to benefit better. While I can understand and also agree to this sentiment to a extent, ultimately the statement is false, no matter how you put it. off the bat with episode 1 you get a murder mystery, many questionable scenes that make you think, and a supernatural ""resurrection"" event happening, all in one. Admittedly though, many of the questionable scenes slip from you, like the few seconds sight of the time machine wouldn't really click with you at all, especially since the details were left in the fog. But this itself indicates that steins gate is more than just a ""slice of life"" romcom. In my view, the slow episodes were needed for us to have some attachments to the character persona that is of Houoin Kyouma, and the introduction and slight developments of other characters, such as Daru, KURISUUTINAAA, Faris, Moeka, etc. The powerful scenes that pull your heart would never be near as effective had we not had these slow episodes to begin with, so my verdict is that the first slow episodes were necessary to make the impact of later episodes just that much better, now moving on to the actual reviews
The story, especially for a sci fi series based around time machines, was put and invented relatively great. The explanation for how this series would use time travel and the quantum theories based to make timelines worked was put together really well, thus making this enjoyable for many people who don't have much of a clue about any scientific involvements, like me hehe, and less confusion which is always a good thing for, like I said, a series about time machines. Since this is based on a VN, there were many route parts left out to be able to work the one, so especially with the d mail re-do saga, seeing the sudden focus go to a side character and a mail they sent can be off-putting, however nevertheless they somehow still pulled through and developed the characters of Okabe and his relationship with Kurisu all to well. The end of the story, regarded as one of the best endings to a anime series ever, and I attest to that, it is quite simply a satisfaction of a ending especially after the amount of dark and heartwrenching scenes we went through. Overall the story is well contrasted, however the last few episodes would feel rushed and not enough suspense, while zero's premise of the show is to fix and add on to this, this still hurts the show as zero is for a whole 'nother review.
The artstyle is subpar, and really that is all there is to say. Nothing over the top but it is just sufficient enough to get the job done.
Sounds were very well done, and the soundtrack, was just absolutely glorious, burrowing some OSTs from the VN it is based on while adding on with series exclusive OSTs is just amazing, when a very impactful scene happens, you are sure to crumble before the music. Words do not do justice to how amazing it is. The opening for the series is a great classic too, but the depth of change to the lyrics based on the Main Character's change in the last few episodes really make it surreal and more meaningful.
Characters were very well developed, obviously our main character Okabe Rintarou, and his mad scientist persona Hououin Kyouma along with Makise Kurisu get the most development
as the show's premise, for the most part, and plot twist is based all around these two. The use of Mayuri is questionable, her presence in the show is just as great as Kurisu, but the use of it makes her feel much less impactful then she really is because she is mostly just the plot device. The other supporting cast are also well developed for the time they were given, specifically Daru and his Daughter, Suzuha.
The enjoyment and overall of the show is just mesmerising, in a wonderful way, I had a absolute blast watching this show, and I sure as hell can say many people who watched this show feel the same as me. There is few inconsistencies and the last few episodes may feel rushed, but in a way this done on purpose anyway as the ""sequel"", zero, is meant to fill the gaps of episode 22 and 23.
Newcomers who have read my review, I do suggest you watch this show, but if time travelling isn't exactly a thing you like, or you're impatient for the pacing of the show, you're enjoyment may well be immensely less.",9

                     Steins;Gate is the smartest anime I've ever watched, there may be a lot of times where you just can't get a grasp of the situation and can't comprehend what is going on, but I felt that the same ignorance I had was shared by the characters, so it only added to the experience. To me when I finally understood something it usually was at the same time (some of) the characters did so it never felt like I was not getting it, it just was that hard that even the geniuses that plage this show couldn't do it.  The characters are such a treat too, I found them incredibly interesting and just plain enjoyable to see them be, while others aspects of this show are not as great the spectacular story makes you forget that sound and art even exist, this is a must watch for anyone that likes a good story, and this obviously goes for all Steins;Gate, not just this season.",10

                ***Warning Spoilers!!!******
I‚Äôm not gonna lie, this show was bloody fantastic. I mean I thought the show was going to be so overrated when I first watched it which is why I held off from it for so long. But after seeing it, I was able to safely put down my doubts as the show is every bit as deserving of its critical acclaim status that it has now.
I think the best thing about the show is the characters and how they were utilized. Okabe‚Äôs character arc was beautifully crafted I was hooked from start to finish. I really liked his transformation from this childish mad
                  scientist into this mature adult that has been seasoned by many of the atrocities that he has suffered throughout the show. I just found him to be incredibly likable as well. He pretends that he‚Äôs in this fantasy world for most of the first chunk of the series in an attempt to make his life seem more exciting. Specifically, he pretends that there is this organization trying to undermine his efforts as he pretends to bring the world to its knees. I found this endearing as many of us pretend to role-play fictional characters that we see in fiction and attempt to make our own lives seem less Mandane.
Mayuri‚Äôs constant tragedy was quite heartbreaking because seeing our main character constantly trying to save her and constantly failing really added to the overall agency of the story. I also really loved how the main character had so much chemistry with Christina and how they went from these sorts of reluctant friends to deep lovers was beautifully handled. They had a lot of chemistry and their back-and-forth was really enjoyable for me. I think my favorite moments with these characters were when Okabe kept calling Christina ‚Äúthe zombie‚Äù and ‚Äúthe assistant‚Äù because the way that she keeps getting frustrated was cute. Though I would say even more than that, I like how Okabe and Daru straight called her a tsundere. It was just really funny because it highlighted the show does not take itself too seriously but still manages to get you deeply invested into its emotional drama. I also like Daru as the comic relief character, I know his jokes regularly pretty dumb but they were just well-executed. I liked his sexual innuendos. I love the part where he kept giving Okabe deeply misguided advice on dating based on his own dating experience in hentai flavored dating games.¬†
I also loved Amane‚Äôs arc in this. I know her arc on paper it‚Äôs kind of clich√© since she is essentially the quintessential time travel character but I really liked the way how she was executed. I like the plot twist that she was the daughter of Daru, and how she had all this bonding time with the rest of the lab team. And watching her goal really hit me emotionally.
Additionally, I just like the story. I know I‚Äôm being kind of vague but the show is so good that there‚Äôs really not much to say. The show has this way of balancing tones. The show can make you burst out laughing sometimes, yet it can also be deathly serious and really pull you by the heartstrings without coming off as inconsistent or tone-deaf. The show does a great job of hyping up its mysteries while providing answers to them. The biggest problem with the whole mystery box approach is that disregards any sort of planning and that usually the actual answers to story building questions a very underwhelming way. Thankfully this is not the case as by the end of it everything mostly makes sense and only makes later episodes even better instead of redundant or even unnecessary. My only real question is how do the Rounders fit in all of this. I have a feeling that they work for STERN but I don‚Äôt think the show really clarifies that. But like I said since I was enjoying the story overall and how each of these characters interacts with each other, I don‚Äôt really mind if somethings were not as well explained if the overall story still makes sense. I also found the death of Moeka at the hands of FB incredibly sad since all she wanted to and accomplish was impress the only person that took her in.
And even the opening was good. Outside of Parasyte and Death Note, this is probably the only anime opening that I actively enjoy it just as much as the show itself. In fact, I actually don‚Äôt skip the intro sometimes just because of how great the opening theme is.
Another thing worth noting was that it was able to make the transition from video game to the small screen of television rather seamlessly. For those of you who don‚Äôt know, this show was actually based on a video game (specifically a visual novel) of the same name. But yet the show was able to adapt the events of the game without actually feeling like a video game when you watch it. This was a big problem with a show like Clannad which felt like a bunch of different routes from its visual novel counterpart smashed together without quite the elegance necessary to make it seem as cohesive as it could‚Äôve been (especially towards the end). Thankfully this is not the case with Steins Gate, as it was executed so well that it does not feel like it was adapted from something else.¬†
I also really like the aesthetic that the show has; it kind of reminds me of a lot of the shows that used to pop up on Cartoon Network at night during the early 2000s. And I consider that a very good thing because a lot of my favorite shows such as The Clone Wars (2003) and Teen Titans were active during those time frames. Because they kind of gave off that quirky yet profound sense of art direction that I just can‚Äôt quite explain. It just gives me a very classic high-quality Cartoon Network vibe that I can‚Äôt help but smile at. I wouldn‚Äôt be the surprise of the show did feature on Cartoon Network at some point in its life cycle. Though I could be wrong about that....but still I feel like the show is right at home with them.
Now one thing I should mention before ending this review is that there is actually a sequel show to the show called ""Steins Gate; Zero"". I am too scared to watch that show because I have seen far too many shows that have a great first season and then just completely go down the gutter in the second season. ¬†Take ""Love and Other Delusions"" for example. With that show, it had a very complete first season that told a very heartbreaking story about embracing your own inner nerd while still being considered cool. Yet the second season largely was unnecessary and just completely undermines everything that was established in the first. And I have a scary feeling that ""Steins Gate; Zero"" might potentially do something similar. I say that because this show had a very definitive ending. It had a clear start and finish that was beautifully crafted and doesn‚Äôt leave much room for potential sequels. So I guess I‚Äôm trying to say that the only flaw I have with the show is that I am scared that the sequel show might not live up to how awesome this particular show is.
Final Verdict
Overall I love this anime so damn much. I love the art direction since it felt very nostalgic to me. I love the opening since it was so good that I would listen to it over and over again. I love the characters and Okabe‚Äôs transformation from childish mad scientist to seasoned adult was quite believable and heartbreaking. I also liked the fact that a lot of the mysteries that the show set up actually had satisfying answers instead of just being overhyped and mysteries that either went nowhere or just felt cheap or contrived. In conclusion. I give the show 4.85/5.00 stars - A fantastic anime that easily ranks among some of the best I‚Äôve ever seen of the genre. The show is right up there as one of my favorite animes ever. I will usually put the show (mentally) on the same shelf as Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Parasyte, Promised Neverland, Kill La Kill, and the rest of the anime that I hold in high regard.

                This story is quite fascinating, from my point of view. It creates some sort of atmosphere that makes you feel that you are actually the Main Character that being traveling back to the past, in order to sort things right. Each episode gives you this feeling this heart-thrilling feeling, like ""What's going to happen next"", ""What will he do to sort it right"". The crazy personality fits the Main Character as well.

                I heard this anime was really good. So I thought I check it out and made it to episode 15. To be honest, while the main story idea is intriguing, I only hung around because the episodes dangled interesting bait for mere moments. Then it went back to lame hard to like characters.
This anime has too many vague perverted references to sex. They think it's funny when it's really not. I stopped on the episode where I heard actual noises of gum smacking. I don't watch anime to hear people chew with their mouth open. That's just nasty.
The opening song to this show was amazing
                  though. And for awhile I was hooked on to keep watching. But 25 episodes fees like too much for what little they reveal in each episode.
I can see why many would like this show but unfortunately for me, I'm done.  I rather waste my time doing something else. 
TLDR It was interesting, amazing opening song, 25 episodes is too long with poor characters",2

                This anime is #3 on the top anime list for a reason. If you haven't seen it, especially if you're a fan of time-travel/sci-fi, please do yourself a favor and commit to watching it. It does take a few episodes to really ramp up, I would say you have to commit to watching the first 10 before you begin to see the depth of the anime's story, but it is well worth it. This anime's character development is expertly done, you feel so attached to the characters and their fates as the anime progresses. Both the dub and sub are quality ways to watch it,
                  the voice actors really bring the characters to life in both. Additionally, even past the excellent complex story of time travel, there's a beautifully written romance underneath. There really is something for everyone in Steins Gate, I would highly recommend it to anime watchers of all kinds.",10
"
                One of the first anime's that are recommended to non anime fans to get them started is Stein's gate because of its quality and entertainment value. Anyone who begins to watch it is doomed to get hooked and obsess over it like yours truly. I will not go into any in depth and intensely technical analysis of the entire show, rather I will simply highlight its quality and thereby providing an overview for anyone interested in watching it.( spoiler free)
Stein's; gate is the story of university student okabe and  his friends who work in  the future gadgets laboratory aka okabes apartment and try
                  to make scientific breakthroughs in the form of various inventions. Okabe a self proclaimed mad scientist is joined by his childhood friend mayuri whoiss a bit air headed, itaru a hacker with perverted mentality, kurisu a brilliant albeit cynical young woman, Moeka a woman with an insatiable desire to find an ibn150, and suzuha a mysterious girl with a whole lot of secrets. There are a few others but they don't tie into the story substantially so I chose to skip them. The story begins when okabes newest invention the  phonewave  turns out to be much more than a micro wave that turn's bananas into green goo. 
The story begins as a science comedy/drama for the first 10 episodes before the drama takes over completely. Its very well written and wonderfully executed catching the viewer's attention and keeping him riveted. Though the science is basically ignored after the 15th episode it still stays strong up to the conclusion. The pacing is a bit slow at first and through the series uneven at times. The drama part of the later episodes do not fit seamlessly into the story but does a good enough job of keeping you on the edge of your seat.
The art style and animation is easy on the eyes and very high quality. Its colorful and detailed. The production value is very high as well not skipping over details and outlining everything meticulously. The character designs are precise and well done though there is almost no change in their costumes. The soundtrack of the series is one of the best I've ever heard and the ending themes are pretty good too. The characters themselves are a bit generic but the great script makes up for that. Though the last 9 episodes are a bit loosely ended and hectic they also largely develop the characters during this part. We get a much clearer view of who the characters are and how they think/feel about each other and everything that's happened in general. This in my opinion is the second best part of the series after the writing since the character development is one most intense and intricate one's I've ever seen.
So if you don't get too hung up on the science and all the paradoxes you will undoubtedly love this show. All I can say is that it justifies all the hype.",9

                I love the sci-fi genre, and time travel is usually a difficult concept to handle. That being said, Steins Gate has done it in a beautiful and satisfying manner.
Character design and art style (6/10)
Nothing stands out in this aspect. The world and characters are aptly built and drawn, but nothing makes you want to pause the scene and re-watch it multiple times.
Animation (5/10)
Just meh. No scenes which contained fluidity, nor was it choppy. Sufficient.
OP/ED music (6/10)
The sound and lyrics are kinda catchy.
Background music (6/10)
It conveys the setting and emotions of the scene.
Voice acting (10/10)
Characters (6/10)
They are not relatable, and some of them are just shallow at times. However, each of the characters have their own tale to tell, and are overall, enjoyable.
Pacing (7/10)
It's a slow start, but when it gets going you'll be thankful that the start was slow.
Story (10/10)
As mentioned before, perception of time and handling of causal loops is just mindblowing. You'll generally have to watch it twice to PROPERLY establish a timeline(if you're into that kinda thing)
Enjoyment (10/10)
Greatly enjoyed the series. 
Small note- Watch ""Steins;Gate: Kyoukaimenjou no Missing Link - Divide By Zero"" (also called episode 23 beta) after the last episode and proceed to watch Steins Gate 0. Then, finish the series with ""Steins;Gate: Oukoubakko no Poriomania"" to finish the series happily.",10
"
                I watched this series after a friend of mine recommended it to me, she said it was slow at first but got real intense after about halfway when sh*t hits the fan. She was right.
TL;DR Good anime with some good plot developments/twists and characters you grow to care about, but a REALLY slow start that comes with characters that you have no reason to like until they get much further development. 
This review has no spoilers!
STORY: 7 / 10
Okay, this was a good story, lots of mind-blowing things that really make you think, like any good time travel or engaging mystery story should, but had
                  very slow pacing in the first half. It built up to a strong final act that ends up relating to another major event and makes you go ‚Äúoooooh.‚Äù I liked the ending as well, it was a satisfying conclusion. That‚Äôs all I really have to say about it without any spoilers if you haven‚Äôt seen it LOL
ART: 9 / 10
I think the style suits the story well, it‚Äôs not crazy beautiful or too simple, the characters can look a little..flat sometimes (like the constant white lab coats along with what seems like little to no shading on the faces at times but that‚Äôs probably just me nitpicking) but overall looks fine.  
SOUND: 10 / 10
The opening was fire.
CHARACTER: 7 / 10
The characters are pretty bland until a fair ways into the anime, I had the biggest issue with Okabe himself. He was extremely unlikable and his personality just felt‚Ä¶gimmicky I guess. Maybe it was secretly really good because I hated him before the second half of the anime after he went through the sh*t hitting the fan and got emotions that weren‚Äôt just *YELLING MAD SCIENTIST STUFF*. I understand it takes time to world build and develop characters but to have some unlikable for that long, makes it really drag and hard to get through. I‚Äôm glad they became so likeable and got some depth other then their character type traits.
Christina (Kurisu) )got pretty good development(thankfully, although she literally starts and remains as ‚Äúsmart tsundere‚Äù for quite a while. Tsundere‚Äôs are one of my least favourite character tropes as they can be pretty mean and even abusive in some cases, but in this case her ‚Äòtsundere-ness‚Äô felt justified because Okabe was so unlikable until he goes through a major event midway. 
Basically, they did a good job of actually showing the character development after it finally happened.
ENJOYMENT: 7 / 10
Was fun to watch and see what would happen next after getting through the slow first half. Fun time travel story. But the slow first half really didn‚Äôt sit well with me, it was actually frustrating for me to sit through. That‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm giving it a slightly lower score, rather then like an 8 or a 9.
OVERALL: 8 / 10",7

                *This review may contain spoilers*
I've found Steins;Gate searching for a thriller/horror anime. In different sites and videos he would appear as one of the best in these genres, so I decided to start watching. 
The first episodes was just cool and funny, but the transitions of the plots was slow and I couldn't get why people would call this anime tense, which made me not create any expectation. I wasn't super excited and I decided to give it a chance. But this had totally changed in episode 12, when the story starts to get really intense and thrilling, shuting my mouth.
I realized that everything was
                  very well thought out. The twelve episodes were put so that whoever watches could create an affective relationship with the laboratory and the characters. Several scenes demonstrate the personality of Mayuri, a kind girl who cares about the people around her. With all that built, episode 12 comes to bring the tension proposed by the anime and indirectly by the plot itself. Very clever of the authors. This made impossible to not sensitize with Okarin constantly being emotionally injured by going back over and over to save Mayuri, while needs to explain to the others the situation. So heartbreaking that every single time Mayuri died I would feel more and more sad. 
The change of pace, in 12, makes you forget past events, which makes even more tense when Okarin (hoping he could keep Mayuri alive) is reminded that changing the timeline to alpha meant killing Kurisu.
Without further ado, I leap to the finish: The outcome is relieving, and leaves no holes for those who watch. It is not a wonderful and splendid ending, but it is good and well closed.
I gave 9 and not 10 to Steins;Gate, due the median calculation with the other aspects:
Story 9: The story was well constructed with the first 12 episodes being the weakest, but still being funny and nice to watch. I gave it a 9 because I think some jokes where misplaced, and some scenes could've been better. 
Art 8: I thinks it's natural for most part of animes to show strange deformations depending on the angle as Steins;Gate did, but something I didn't like it was the super unnecessary sexualization of female characters. Didn't happened often, but it bothered me, making me giving it a 8 to art construction. 
Sound 8: For me this one was the weakest of it all. The opening song and video were horrible, if I watched one time it was too much. In the anime, the dubbing and ambientation were amazing, but sometimes in other aspects like fights, were weak and poor. 
Character 10: Amazing, wonderful, brilliant. Each of the characters have its own outstanding personality. There's only a few, so that don't have unecessary filler characters. This way, it's easy for you to create a relation with them all. 
Enjoyment:  The most unbearable was endure the jokes out of limit from Okarin. I was getting in my nerves. But, in general, this anime was funny, surrounding and comfortable to watch. There's no artificial gore or too surreal scenes. It's a scientific fantasy presented with scientific facts, even if it's impossible to happen.",9
"
                i watch this show after it's completed.
it got so much hype and plastered with tittle the best anime of the year. 
so i started watch it with high anticipation, that's my fault actually.
contrary to popular opinion, i don't like series. it's like a harem version of butterfly effect (a film starred by ashton kutcher). the male/main character not interesting a bit, too generic. and the female characters too. only found 2 female characters that have interesting personality/chara design.
but it's not as bad as i want to drop the series.
my conclusion
it doesn't deserve the hype, more over the title
best anime of the year.

                [Spoilers] This is one of those all-timers that I'll enjoy no matter how many times I've watched it. The actual plot is fairly simple, but the detail is unbelievably thorough. The show raises questions regarding quantum physics, human psychology, and mind philosophy, questions I never thought a show could make viewers answer. How many times would you watch a loved one die in futile efforts to save them? The difficult task of balancing this kind of heavy material with quirky comedy is executed nearly flawlessly, as most characters (especially Itaru) have their funny moments. Steins;Gate will make you laugh, cry, and leave you in awe.
                  That's what's important, kudos to the creators for making unforgettable characters for this modern masterclass of anime.",10

                Well i think i haven't done any review in past but having watched steins;gate makes me want to write a review for experience.
This will be a naive review for my first time writing a review for an anime so ill make it short.
this anime contains almost everything needed, it has a good and captivating story-line. It stays on the story-line in every show and has its good combination of sci-fi, romance, comedy and mystery. the proportions of these factors are chosen in an expert way which makes this anime keep you watching it till the end while keep you guessing from time to time.
I felt
                  like it had a little slow start but i'd say it doesn't affect the richness of the series.
This anime is actually one of my favorite one. and i hope to see if they make a second one. but chances seem pretty slim.",9

                Overview:
Of the many, many genres out there, time-travel is easily one of the least-explored in anime. While there are quite a few anime that have it, most of the time it's simply used as a plot device, so rarely do you get an anime that is largely centred around it. ""Steins;Gate"" is one of these rare anime. Not only is time-travel the focus here, but it delivers one of (if not THE) most unique takes on the concept I have ever seen, the result being a highly intriguing series that I definitely think you will enjoy watching.
Story (9/10):
""Steins;Gate"" is centred around Rintarou Okabe, a first
                  year university student who claims to be a 'mad scientist' and often spends time with his friends Mayuri Shiina and Itaru Hashida (Daru) making gadgets, with the most promising one being a microwave that can be controlled via a cell phone. Shortly after meeting a teen genius called Kurisu Makise, Okabe finds her lying on the ground stabbed to death. However, after texting Daru about this incident, he finds Kurisu, inexplicably, alive and well, almost as though she's been brought back from the dead. Soon after, he discovers that the Phonewave, as he has dubbed it, is actually a time machine that can send text messages back in time.
Now, Okabe is initially overjoyed by the whole thing, as he has a great fascination with time machines. Recruiting Kurisu into the Future Gadget Laboratory, the two of them, along with Mayuri and Daru, begin to experiment with the Phonewave. However, one thing about time travel Okabe apparently didn't learn is that altering the past has dire consequences on the present, and it's not long before he begins to face serious repercussions for his actions.
The story is brilliant, but it does take a good while to get going, as it's only until a truly shocking scene at the end of episode 9 that things really start to get interesting. And when it picks up, it REALLY picks up, becoming a serious emotional roller-coaster that, at times, throws one feel after another at you. However, due to the nature of the series, these feels don't last very long. This is probably my biggest problem with the story. While the emotional scenes are certainly great when you watch them, the impact they have doesn't last due to the fact that they can be undone simply by sending a text back in time. Thankfully, this isn't always the case and there are some scenes where characters are forced to make serious sacrifices for the greater cause. Admittedly, the solution to the ending felt somewhat convenient as well, but overall the story is extremely well-written, with surprisingly few (if any) plot holes.
Art & Animation (9.5/10):
Close your eyes for a bit and imagine what you'd expect from a good-looking anime. Crisp art style? Well drawn characters and environments? Minimal fanservice beyond a couple of girls with oversized breasts? Check, check and check. To put it simply, this is a fantastic looking anime, with every character having a unique design and the animations being very slick. It's not completely jaw-dropping, but art-wise it's easily one of the best looking anime out there.
Sound & Dialogue (9/10):
I'll start with the opening and ending themes, which are two of the best anime themes I have ever heard. I don't think I was able to watch a single episode without listening to both of them. They're that good. Unfortunately, apart from them, the soundtrack is not particularly notable. It's scarcely used and when it is, it tends to just blend in. There are a few scenes in which the music really amplifies the emotion, but they are few and far between. Thankfully, this is made up for by the brilliant voice acting. J. Michael Tatum delivers a fantastic performance as Okabe, with Trina Nishimura easily complimenting him as Kurisu. The most surprising bit about the acting for me, however, was Ashley Burch as Mayuri. Before I watched the series, I only knew her as the really annoying Sakura Sakurakouji, so to see her voicing a really cute character like Mayuri with a completely different voice is surprising, to say the least. The dialogue is mostly great as well, particularly Kurisu's sarcasm and the number of movie references (most notably Delorean Mail, which they call the text messages).
Characters (8/10):
The cast of characters is not very big. Besides the four core lab members, there are four other major supporting characters that join the lab in order to fulfill requests. However, once these issues are resolved you don't see much of these characters. Generally, the ones who get the most focus are Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri and Daru. One notable quirk about Okabe is his tendency to nickname everyone, giving the most nicknames to Kurisu. However, she seems to hate being nicknamed, as she frequently tells him to stop calling her 'Christina'- to absolutely no avail. Of course, this causes a lot of arguing between the two of them, which is very amusing to watch.
However, if you're one of those people who consider character development to be essential, then you are going to be in for a whopper of a disappointment, because the only character who notably changes throughout the series is Okabe. This is partially due to constant timeline-changing nature of the series- Okabe is the only one able to remember everything that happens, and so initially has no idea about the drastic changes the D-Mails make. This is due to an ability called 'Reading Steiner', which apparently everyone has but only he has fully activated. As he begins to realise what he has done, he becomes a lot more melancholic and clinical, soon regretting  what he has done and realising how stupid he was.
Unfortunately, this is where one of the problems I had with him surfaces. Towards the end, I felt that his character development went in a backwards direction. Basically, a large part of it was him realising that his 'mad scientist' persona had caused far more harm than good and just when you think you know where it's all going, a scene triggers a reset button and brings him back to almost exactly as he was before, almost as though half of what he had been saying for the past five episodes or so built up to nothing at all. Regardless, I did still really enjoy both him and the other characters. Well, most of them. I didn't really like Ruka that much (there really isn't that much to say about him other than he's a dude who looks like a lady), but literally everyone else was great. Besides Okabe, I think Kurisu is a great heroine, always loyal and there to help in spite of her constant sarcasm. Mayuri is adorable but also quite tragic and sad and Daru, despite being a perverted otaku, is one of the most down-to-earth characters I have seen in any anime. Overall, the characters are probably the weak point of the series but that doesn't stop them from being great, even if there aren't very many of them.
Enjoyment (8.5/10):
As I mentioned above, ""Steins;Gate"" takes quite a while to finally get going. There are some great comedic moments before then but if you're not a fan of comedy then you'll probably be bored for the entire first half of the series. If you can make it to the end of episode 12, however, then you will absolutely want to watch the whole thing to the end, though I certainly wouldn't recommend watching it again straight afterwards. 
Overall:
""Steins;Gate"" is an incredibly original take on time travel with a great story, brilliant art and fun characters. It's a real surprise time travel isn't used more often in anime, as this pulls it off brilliantly. As opposed to what some others might say, however, I don't think it's perfect, being held back by a few minor flaws. Is the best anime I've ever seen? No, not even in my top ten. Is it a unique, intelligent, expertly written series that's well worth your time? Definitely.
Score:
9+9.5+9+8+8.5=44/50=8.8/10",9

                WARNING, review has spoilers spaced from the rest at the bottom, if you do not want spoilers, do not read past where I put my overall rating and the second spoiler warning (which is in all caps).
Time travel can be a very convenient plot device for lazy writing, see this as an example. The time travel tries to feel scientific but fails when aspects like characters guaranteed to die are added because it doesn't make much sense given logical reasoning. Half the how-time-works explanation feels well done and fleshed out, but the other half (specifically that pertaining to the 1% whatever and characters being bound
                  to die for no reason other than plot) fail miserably. The writing in this feels like how a AAA first person shooter feels, addictive but not really entertaining. There are constant cliff hangers and parts that are meant to be ""so sad"" in order to desperately try and draw the viewer in, but in the end just feel empty because you know that the MC has time travel and nothing that happens really matters that much. 
Speaking of the MC, he is definitely not one of my favorites. He claims to be a mad scientist but he is never really seen doing any science, engineering or the like, instead having the other characters do it for him as he acts as more of just a project manager. His 8th grade syndrome is also really annoying and feels unnecessary, just added to make him feel like some sort of self insert character dream for those with 8th grader syndrome. He is also amazingly dull sometimes, and not even just in the way of most anime protagonists who can't figure out that a girl likes them, but also in the way that he completely trusts pretty much everyone around him who shows any interest in him and rarely learns from his mistakes. He has amazingly thick plot armor as well, always able to get back to the time machine when he needs to and other things like that.
The plot is also amazingly predictable, to an honestly astounding level. I never thought I would be able to predict the twists and turns of a show as far in advance as I could with this one (sometimes multiple episodes in advance), but that is by no means a complement to the show. Instead it just feels frustrating as the viewer is given approximately the same amount of information as the MC, but the MC is so stupid that he can't figure out any of the things before they happen. A lot of the main moments throughout the show are set up in the most typical way possible, making the entire plot feel like a bunch of tropes packed together.
There are some things that the show does well, the way it portrays the main ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù of the show as nothing more than desperate marionettes makes what they do feel at least somewhat realistic. The visual portrayal of the MCs stress, depression, apathy and hopelessness also feels pretty well done and helps the viewer get in the headspace of the MC.
The parts of the time travel that are done well do feel really good (pretty much all the early stuff that doesn‚Äôt have to do with the differences between alpha and beta timelines, etc.). This makes it feel like even more of a let down when the less sensible parts of time travel are added as the authors just get lazy trying to compensate for how little anything matters by forcing some things to be ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù even though it doesn‚Äôt make logical sense. The universe isn‚Äôt some assassin that hunts down people to make sure they always die at a certain point and the addition of this just hurts the plot by making it so that all the established logic and reasoning mean nothing since the authors can just add whatever BS they want. There are some other issues as well, for example, WHY DOES EATING MEAT VS VEGETABLES WHILE PREGNANT CANONICALLY CHANGE A BABY'S GENDER WHEN THEY ARE BORN. Just screw genetics (XY vs XX sets of chromosomes) and how human reproduction works I guess. 
Overall this series had a lot of promise and a moderately satisfying ending, but there are just so many issues that I can‚Äôt rate it too well. 
OVERALL RATING: 5/10 Average anime, I have a neutral opinion towards it (other than maybe a bit of disappointment).
SPOILER WARNING: POINTS BELOW ARE CERTAIN SPOILERS FROM THE SHOW IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY MY ASSERTION THAT THE SHOW IS PREDICTABLE.
The whole scene with Nae pushing Mayuri in the subway is one of my least favorite scenes in all of anime. The second I saw Mayuri and Okabe standing right by the edge of the train tracks I thought to myself ""Mayuri is going to get pushed into the oncoming train now, isn't she"". Then I saw Nae being highlighted amongst the crowd ""so Nae is probably going to be involved with her getting pushed"". Then Nae bumps into Mayuri and Mayuri goes absolutely flying (IDK how, a little girl runs into her and she is thrown 5 meters fowards for some reason because screw physics) right as the train goes through and it hits her. Also for some reason Okabe was barely even holding onto Mayuri's hand so he couldn't stop her from flying in front of the train, even though just before he had seemed to have a tight grip on her hand. Now, logically speaking Okabe could certainly go back in time, do things roughly the same, but just either have Mayuri further back from the tracks or brace her so that Nae doesn't send her flying and there we go, Mayuri saved (which was his goal). Instead however, Okabe doesn't do this, instead trying more and more convoluted methods to fail at saving her. As I said earlier in the review, the universe is not some obsessive hitman and it is stupid that the show thinks it is.
The ""twist"" of Moeka being a bad guy and her sending a different D-mail than just the one about not buying a new phone were both painful obvious right after she sent that D-mail. Like after she sends that D-mail the IBN 5100 (which she has obsessively wanted to get for a reason that Okabe never even thinks to ask about) has disappeared from the shrine and Moeka is suddenly busy with ""work"", I WONDER WHY THAT IS.
Suzuha being the daughter of Hashida was also pretty easy to guess since she went to the convention where her father was supposed to be but he didn't end up being there. At the same time Okabe had called Hashida away from the convention where he was supposed to go. This one I wasn't super sure about (her father could have ended up being some random 3rd party character that becomes relevant later, that does also happen with decent frequency in anime) but was still something I was pretty confident to be the case and was proven right on.
The one major twist I didn't predict (excluding the Braun one because that was only relevant for like 5 minutes in the entire series and honestly did do well on having little indication of that being the case) was the final Kurisu being saved one but that was only because I ruled that out from being an option because IT WAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED SOMEONE MUST DIE UNLESS THERE IS A HUGE CHANGE IN THE TIMELINE. The confusing part about it is that the major change is not her death but the papers burning up. Since her death could happen and the papers could still burn up (since that is because of the metal upa) why would she stay alive given the rules of the timelines. If it is possible that there is one timeline where she still dies and the papers burn vs her not dying and the papers burning (which logically should be the case), shouldn't that mean that there is also a timeline where Mayori doesn't die but everything else remains roughly the same?! Both of them dieing vs living would have major consequences on the future given the butterfly effect so it doesn't make sense why one case works and the other doesn't. A major inconsistency in the mechanics of the world is just as bad as a predictable plot, which is why I am including it in here.",5

                Steins;Gate is a very enjoyable anime that knows exactly what it's doing with its story. The story is short and focused, and the few filler episodes there were I enjoyed just to be able to spend more time with the characters, who are all great. I'm a massive fan of time travel, and this anime scratches the exact right itch that I expected coming into it. The setting is beautifully animated and during some of the calmer moments during the first half of the series I wish i lived in it. The only reason it loses some ground is because unless you really like time
                  travel, you may not have the patience to watch the beginning half that sets up the main conflict. I however, was hooked the entire run. If you even have a passing interest in time travel stories, this isn't one you'll want to miss.",10
"
                My favorite anime so far, so the review would be rather subjective. This anime is focused on the time-travel concept, though it has not been proven in our present world.  There is also a bit of romance involved, and there is also sadness‚Äîboth aspects would make certain viewers attached to the series itself.  
This anime is one of the very few that actually has some logic with regard to the time-travel theory.  The plot was very interesting and sorted out.  The ‚Äúfeels-train‚Äù however, was not something that you would expect in this kind of series.  The plot twists are so
                  twisted that you would hope that the anime just ends immediately to stop Okabe Rintaro from suffering any further. Though he‚Äôs one weird guy, he is actually quite considerate of his friends.  Having the burden of having memories about other people‚Äôs sadness, and also being ‚Äúalone‚Äù in that matter, makes you feel bad for Okabe.  
However, I will let you know that there are also funny scenes included in this series, so you would not feel ‚Äúthe feels‚Äù until the latter part of this anime.  The (not-so-random and factual) ideas seem to be true, but still, they are just theories.  Nevertheless, the fact that they seem plausible makes the anime relate-able for some. The what-if‚Äôs in the backs of our minds will pop-up as we continue to watch the anime.  Curiosity might get the best of your experience in watching the series: if you do not have an imaginative mind, then this kind of anime is not really recommended for you, but the situational jokes and the eight-grade syndrome might just keep you and pull you until you finish the series.  
The artwork is not award-winning, but what really matters is that it does not look weird or creepy (except for the gel-nana/gel-man). I love the original soundtracks (OSTs) and plot twists.  If you find this series entertaining, a movie sequel is available, and this movie is dated after a year when Okabe arrived at the Steins;gate world line. (Re-watched late 2015).",10

                A Sci-Fi Thriller Enjoyment!
I finished this series not too long ago and I'm ready to do a rewatch because I enjoyed it that much. However, when I got introduced into STEINS;GATE I didn't know what to expect but I heard the hype around it and figured..why not check it out. I agree that it does live up to the hype and STEINS;GATE is in my top 5 favorite animes of all time. Never have I seen a story or anime in that matter like this one! The story is about time travel and STEINS;GATE executes it right and believable. Now don't get me wrong, the
                  show was a slow burner at first and I was going back and forth to finish the series or not but I'm so glad I stuck it out and finished it. It was an unforgettable experience!",9
"
                This review MIGHT contain spoilers, but if there are spoilers they will be very slight and nothing major, anyways, on with the review.
Story - Amazing, lots of cool stuff, lots of time travel, good bits of foreshadowing, and more.
Art - It has a certain charm to it, kind of like Death Note. It also helps if you compare it to the style usually used for anime, it's kind of unique.
Sound - Banger soundtrack, it slaps. That's all I need to say.
Character - Amazing characters, a lot of them manage to be a sort of stereotype while also having some layers. The protagonist, Okabe Rintar- I
                  mean Hououin Kyouma is my absolute favorite though. 
Enjoyment - Steins;Gate stars out a little slow, but give it time. It will be worth it.
Overall, I really liked this anime. I'm glad I was able to find it out through watching some certain other animes. One of my favorites for sure!",10
"
                Steins;Gate is one of the most memorable anime for me
Synopsis : 
Tells about the self-proclaimed mad scientist Okabe Rintarou or better called ""Hououin Kyouma"" who runs a science lab with his friends and manages to create a time machine that can send messages to the past. Conflict arises when Okabe has to face the consequences for having ""played"" with time 
The reason I like this anime is, because :
1) The storyline is unique and complex, although the pace is very slow, even the first 10 episodes feel really boring, but the more we come here, the more serious the atmosphere and we realize that
                  the slow start is very meaningful, even I miss Okabe's jokes because everything feels so serious , very tense and chaotic
2) I like stories that use the concept of time travel and this anime makes the most of the power and mystery of time travel
3) Many emotional moments that make us feel the impact of the psychological chaos and pain that Okabe went through especially when Mayuri said ""Mayushi Clock Stop!"" OH NOO!!",10
"
                I enjoyed Steins;Gate a lot, does it deserve such a high rating on MAL? No. The story transitions from a slice-of-life comedy to a thriller drama, and involves a lot of theoretical physics which I did not really understand but was compelled to search things up to understand the show, I liked watching the show and unraveling the mystery in the first half, although it felt a bit slow during my first watch.
Expectations matters, and this is why I am compelled to give the show a 7 instead of an 8, as even though I really enjoyed the show it is far from a masterpiece.
                  There are some minor errors in adapting the source material which really bothered me, but most people probably would not notice. The characters were rather 2-dimensional aside from the main protagonist Okabe, if the character criteria is based on him alone I probably would have given it a 10. 
The art was pleasing but nothing special really, there are some errors in the animation I spotted but again, it probably wouldn't matter to most people.
The story is complex and intriguing but if you look into it you might have to suspend your disbelief sometimes, it is in NO way a scientifically accurate show so please do not go in expecting that. The show has a rather slow start. The show focuses on experimentation and setting up the characters in the beginning and takes a long time doing it. If you like science but don't' like nitpicking the shit out of shows involving science this is your show. I love science but I am a high schooler who gets average grades so don't take my word for it when I tell you that science is the main grab of the show.
This is Japanese Rick and Morty basically.",7
"
                I believe this is truly peak anime, nothing I've ever watched will ever peak what this show has done for me. I've watched Steins gate 5 years ago but I didn't understand it at all, so I came back to it and I can now say this is hands down my favorite anime.
The shock factor, interesting characters & dialogue, philosophical reasoning, OST, and every other aspect is just perfectly balanced.
All the characters have their unique charm & some sense of grounded realism as to why they act the way they do. Kurisu is also best girl of all time, and Hacking to the gate is
                  a brilliant OST.
The art is highly stylized to look this way & fits the subject so well, It would not have worked as well if there was a more vivid & less stylized art. The unclear & often blinding setting adds to the experience so much.
Overall 10/10",10
"
                Well i must admit that this has definitely been one of the best quality story telling animes i have seen. The theme is of these teenagers who build a machine that can send texts back into time, and the terrible prices this comes with. This isnt your average, we are breaking the time continuum we will dissapear from existence story you could probably find in anything from a Pokemon movie to a high budget drama, as it offers a completely fresh and interesting take on existence and the power of fate. The characters almost all get a significant amount of character armor throughout the show,
                  and the plot twists keep this anime fresh and wanting you more every episode. I recommend giving this a watch if you want to encounter a phenomenal story backed by good enough characters.",9
"
                Listen up this anime has it's very good quirks including, the mind blowing plot twist, mind fucking time travel, and it's little bit of romance to the end. My only problem is that to me the show is very slow and boring. I also really have a problem with the characters they don't really explain it great, on top of that the way the show starts i did not know what the fuck was going on, but as i kept on watching everything started to make sense. This anime really leaves you on in the end to want to know whats going to happen next
                  and how to find a way to save Mayuri Shiina from dying. Let me conclude this by saying the anime is good but it's not a masterpiece either, and for me what really made me almost drop the show was the begging was so all over the place, but hey thats just my opinion you might have another and that is perfectly fine but to me it just really overrated. 
Other than that i hope you like my almost easy to understand review.
Follow me for more easy reviews and im just rying to do people a favor by not having to read long ass reviews!",6
"
                Story: Very original for a 2011 piece, all the terminologies semi-connects, and the storytelling makes sense. Enjoyment wise the topic is very, very good, and lives up to the genre.
Art: I am not a big fan of the doomsday typestyle, where everything is grayscaled. So that is a 7 for me. Attention to detail is good tho.
Sound: Very mediocre.
Character: Every character has full development, unlike some other anime. Cough Cough Index III, and are all equally important for story progression. The interconnectedness is unparalleled and just goes to show how great this story is.
Enjoyment: very nice.
Edit: Episode 12 first 60 seconds, REMEMBER IT!!!!!!!!",10
"
                Just having watched the show for the first time, and I'm sure future me would sell a body part or two just to erase my memory and watch this again. 
Every episode just gets better and better, and when I shat my pants and thought it wouldn't get any better, it got better. 
Definitely worth the shatted pants. 
The story was pretty solid, the art was great, the sounds were well put together, and I enjoyed it as much as I was able to.
Definitely could hate it if I wanted to, but why would I. 
Definitely could find every flaw it has and feel disappointed,
                  but why would I.
Would rather go watch more anime.
Overall, It was a 10/10 for me, but It's understandable why people call it overrated.
Anyways, if anyone says Kurisu isn't the best waifu ever, I will be under your bed.",9
"
                Dear readers,
If you would like to watch a sci-fi and thriller anime, then you should watch this one, because it has also comedy in it and the best Engrish you've ever heard. 
Story:
The idea that there are scientist finding out how a microwave can send emails to the past. It was strange at the point where the story had a twist, when some sort of organisation barged into their apartment and killed people. Okabe (Main Character) tries to undo his past mistakes by sending emails to the past again for changing everything to how it was in the beginning. 
Characters:
Okabe Rintarou: mad scientist and a
                  bit exaggerating about the some sort of organisation that tries to get intel from them. He is also really funny.
Mayuri Shiina: childhood friend of Okabe Rintarou and basically one of the lab members at the apartment his. She is a bit annoying with her Tuturu whenever she sees him, but he is really really funny.
Kurisu Makise: smart young girl with a jealous father, because of her accomplishments. She is also one of the lab members of Okabe Rintarou and comforts him in bad times. She is talented for her age and tries Okabe to turn everthing back to how it was in the past with Okabe's mistakes.
Itaru Hashida: big guy who is also a lab member of Okabe Rintarou and helps him by hacking programs and companies. 
Enjoyment:
I really liked the anime, because it was original and it is an anime from 2011 so that is now around 7 years ago. The story was original, although I say this with almost every anime that I review XD. I also liked the idea that they were making mistakes and were trying to undo them. Btw, a time travelling machine is also a big plus for my enjoyment, because it worked and it was useful to them by changing their mistakes.",8

                There's no other anime like Steins Gate. Its my favourite anime. You will have a pretty good time while watching steins gate. It has the best tsundere in the world. The way the steins gate's story unravels is awesome, its magical, its thriller, its funny, its got all the things an anime would need.
It is boring in the beginning, but trust me it gets soooo much better after 10 ep. I would recommened it. 
The characters are so likable. The delusional main character -Okabe Rinturu, matures with every episode, like every episode is a different timeline, a different experience. Its pretty fascinating. There's a pervert
                  dude - Taru, who's actually pretty funny, smart and later proves to be one the most important characters in the story. Mayuri Shina was, actually is pretty cute, felt bad for her as she thinks she isn't useful as the others. And then there's the best tsundere in the world - Makise Kurisu. The main character, me and many other people adore this character.
""If you break your promise,I will stab an electrode in your frontal lobe""
- Makise Kurisu.",10
"
                It's  an  absurdly  good  anime,  in  the  first  3  episodes  you  won't understand  much,  but  then  everything  will  be  explained  and  there  will be no doubt.  Definitely  one  of  the  best  anime  I've  ever watched.  Here are  characters  that  you  will  like  easily,  I'll  recommend  them   to  everyone.  As  far  as  I've  seen  no  negatives, 
                  the  OVA  ends  the  story   in  one  of  the  best  ways  possible.   Now  all  that  remains  is  to  watch the  other   parts,  I  don't know  if  they  will  be  canonical  or  not.  But  I 
 think  they  will  be  cool.  10/10 Of course

Story 10/10
This story is special, the plot includes time travel, maybe it is a very used plot in different media, but BELIEVE ME this story is different. Much of the story is based on sending messages to the past and modifying the future, and it doesn't create plot errors or paradoxes, then they SEND MINDS TO THE PAST and yet there are NO paradoxes, that's why this story is amazing. I don't want to give spoilers about the ""antagonists"" or John Titor's plot so you better enjoy the series.
                  Another thing I loved was how the approach of the story tries to be optimistic during the first 19 chapters and from chapter 20 or 21 the hopes are lost, you manage to get very well into the plot
Art 10/10
It is also perfect, I didn't see any mistake in the drawing or little fluidity, the colors show you perfectly the kind of story that wants to show and you don't feel out of place at any time. While there are no scenes that have some very fluid animation, it is not necessary to have something like that to achieve perfection.
Sound 8/10
I don't have much to say here, I don't remember any soundtrack even having started this anime today and also after finishing it today, it just wasn't memorable, but I didn't dislike it when I was watching it either, so I guess it's okay. The opening is great so I don't have to give it a bad rating, but the ending could be better.
Character 10/10
The characters are great except for Mayuri. Mainly Okabe and Makise are very good protagonists, aside from their own development which is very good, they also directly drive the development of the other characters. Again I don't want to give spoilers but they really are very good.
Story 10/10
Esta  historia es especial, la trama incluye viajes en el tiempo, quiz√°s es una trama muy usada en distintos medios, pero CR√âANME que esta historia es distinta. Gran parte de la historia se basa en mandar mensajes al pasado y modificar el futuro, y no crea errores argumentales ni paradojas, luego MANDAN MENTES AL PASADO y aun as√≠ NO hay paradojas, por eso esta historia es incre√≠ble. No quiero dar spoilers sobre los ""antagonistas"" o la trama de John Titor as√≠ que mejor hay que disfrutar la serie. Otra cosa que me encant√≥ fue como el enfoque de la historia trata de ser optimista durante los primeros 19 cap√≠tulos y a partir del capitulo 20 o 21 se pierden las esperanzas, logras entrar muy bien en la trama
Art 10/10
Tambi√©n es perfecto, no vi ning√∫n error en el dibujo ni poca fluidez, los colores te muestran perfectamente el tipo de historia que quiere mostrar y no te sientes desubicado en ning√∫n momento. Si bien no hay escenas que tengan alguna animaci√≥n muy fluida, tampoco es que haga falta tener algo as√≠ para alcanzar la perfecci√≥n
Sound  8/10
Aqu√≠ no tengo mucho que decir, no recuerdo ninguna banda sonora aun habiendo empezado este anime hoy y tambi√©n despu√©s de haberlo terminado hoy, simplemente no fue memorable, pero tampoco me desagrad√≥ cuando lo estaba viendo, as√≠ que supongo que est√° bien. El opening es buen√≠simo as√≠ que no tengo que darle mala calificaci√≥n, pero el ending podr√≠a ser mejor
Character 10/10
Los personajes son buen√≠simos a excepci√≥n de Mayuri. Principalmente Okabe y Makise son muy buenos protagonistas, aparte de su desarrollo propio que es muy bueno, tambi√©n impulsan directamente el desarrollo de los dem√°s personajes. De nuevo no quiero dar spoilers pero de verdad son muy buenos",10
"
                This is an immensely satisfying work of time travel fiction. That's the word I'd use, satisfying. It's got a bit of a wind-up, but it pays of with a back half that had me crying, laughing, and getting worked up in all the right places. 
It was also kinda clumsy at times, but not in a way I find surprising for a lot of anime. It's visual novel roots are both its greatest strength (the story was SO well thought out from the start) and lead to some of its flaws. It kinda feels like a dating sim at times, which works in a game
                  where you are the player character but in a show, it did feel weird seeing how everything in the world revolved around Okabe.
I think the biggest issue I had with it was Ruka's characterization. I truly get what they were going for but it's disappointing to see an anime fumble another potentially interesting trans narrative. It wasn't transphobic, but it definitely felt clumsy.
Mostly though, yeah this show delivers the goods. It knows its audience and gives us those moments we crave throughout. Definitely worth watching if you love that time travel goodness form stuff like Russian Doll or the good seasons of Doctor Who.",9
"
                Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce to you the series which inspired time travel themed anime: Steins;Gate!
To be honest, it actually took me 3 years to finish this damn series. It was even put on-hold for 2 years after 10 episodes because I found it boring. But once I finished it, I finally understood why this series has a high ranking: It's the mix of genres.
Normally, one would simply label this show as sci-fi. Heck, even I did too. But after watching till the end, I realized something:It contained more genres than I thought. There was comedy, romance, drama, horror, mystery, ecchi/harem (yes,
                  there's e/h), action, slice of life, etc. The way these genres were incorporated made it difficult to observe because they were well-mixed, like cake batter.
Yes, I ranked this anime 9/10, but it doesn't mean it isn't a masterpiece. It's just not my cup of tea. But I definitely recommend this to those tired of generic plots. It won't be long until you discover the true meaning of Steins;Gate!",9
"
                That's my favorite anime, to be honest, many of my friends laugh at me cause i watch anime, and I felt ashamed too, peaple really analyze anime with a kind of prejudice, i hate it. 
Here comes the review :)
First of all, i need to say that steins;gate it's my favorite sci-fi show (not just in anime, that's in a competition with star trek), the thing that i love in steins;gate is that it is consistent, all the episodes have a relationship, u can realize this when u watch it for the second time, and you can see many details that r awesome, the first
                  part is boring i know, but when you really thinks about that part you can know how important it was.
Forgive my english errors, it isn't my native language but i did't use google translator.",9

                SPOILERS
Here it is, the coup de grace of all anime. This is by far the greatest anime of all time. Let me explain... This anime has such intense music, beautiful animations, an impactful story and a harrowing tail. The main character is seen as a bit a jokester until things start to pan out and he loses his will to live and yade yade yada yada dont want to spoil or anything but shit hits the fan at episode 4 like everything before is kinda like whatever its buildup and shit but then out of nowhere i mean this nigga ah shit i dont want
                  to spoil but bro it is so wild. So basically the first scene canonically is up to the very end of the last episode where he goes to save Kirisu but in order for this path to take way, Steins gate 0 comes into place where its the timeline. Steins gate 0 is the original timeline. The first season is actually the succesful timeline but only happens because he failed first. In this timeline we see him lose his happiness, become suicidal, lose all hope, but he pulls through, its an unbeliavlbe adventure steins gate 0 perfectly articulates what the main character went through in his trumpths and failures, at the end of steins gate 0 i dont want to spoil but it basically is the same exact ending as the first one but theres a few added back scenes of the other timeline mixed in to give a little more information. At the very end, a epic fucking scene takes place that literally made me cry. The music is so beautiful and precise with whats going on in the story and captivates the tone of the story. The movie is basically what happens after. In the movie, he gets flashbacks like a ptsd kinda thing because he saw his friends die hundreds of times over and over and over again and that took a heavy toll on him. But then he keeps going into the different timelines because he did it so much with the machine his body is switching between them. It gets to a point wherein  the main timeline, people literally forget his existence not even remembering his name
This accomponied by the protaginist of the movie Kurisu which is prevelant throughout the whole of the film, gives a new and enlightening backdrop and heroine. So, in summary, the movie is great, the first season is awesome, and the second season is legendary. If you havent watched this film, then u need to stop right now what ur doing. Stop beating off, stop smoking hemp, stop watching ur shitty triple a anime and get on this bandwagon. I will however, state that this anime does take a decent brain size to comprehend. Not only is it sonewhat confusing at first, but i mean the main character drinks freaking doctor pepper ok thats how u know this shit is validation. Anyway this anime, for having the best music, the greatest protagonist, the most ambitious and fantastic story in the world and having well crafted comedy and beautiful waifus, this show deserves nothing less then the highest possible 10/10 i can give within my power and the easiest badass seal of approval i have ever given an anime. The contrast between the hapiness and sadness between season 1 and season 2 is well crafted because of the feeling of hopelessness and the feeling of desperation added with the apparel and aesthetic gives off a strong vibe and overall a well feeling after finishing the show. Your stomach will be in a knot before during and after watching this show \ I have reawatched like 50 times and it never gets old trust me on that homie. 10/10+Badass Seal of Approval",10

                Stein's Gate is a brilliant sci-fi anime, and one of the most emotional series I have ever watched. Having said that, I feel it is definitely an anime of two halves, the first being just good, and the second half being a straight up masterpiece. Over the years i tried to push through those first several eps, yet found myself losing interest and dropping the series after about 6-8 eps. Yet recently i decided to push through and complete the series.....and boy am i glad I did! SG goes from being a fairly interesting sci-fi time travel story with the occasional wacky comedy moment, into
                  an intensely emotional, dark, often sad, and powerful journey with a group of characters I quickly came to love.  
I honestly cannot overstate how much the show changes for the better in its second half. A pivotal moment at the end of episode 12 changes the tone of the show in such a jarringly brutal way. It totally caught me off guard, and I instantly transformed from mildly interested into edge of my seat, jaw on the floor, completely engaged and invested in the story and how it would unfold. Part of SG's appeal for me is how unapologetically it pulls this switch in tone, but also how swiftly the characters change. In particular the transformation of our protagonist Okabe, from delusional wacky mad scientist, into a broken-hearted shell of a man, carrying the burden of knowledge and memories of the many different time lines with him. The Japanese voice actor did an amazing job of contrasting the two sides of Okabe's personality. 
Another credit to SG is how adeptly it handles its time travel story. So many times we have seen similar time travel stories get so overly complicated and nonsensical that in the end the writer's trap themselves in a corner. But here we see a well thought out resolution to the story, as well as real and tragic consequences to character's actions. 
So in conclusion, if like me you kinda lost interest during the series first half, KEEP WATCHNG. By the end of SG you will be floored by its brilliance, trust me.",9
"
                Steins;Gate simply has one of the best stories I've ever seen, and it manages to keep you on the edge of your seat once it gets going, and it's an experience you won't forget.
The story starts off rather slow, and the pacing is a bit off, I'll be honest. This doesn't detract from my enjoyment however, because if there's something I thoroughly enjoy, it's time-travel. And that is exactly what this anime manages to capture so incredibly well; The sense of discovery which slowly starts to change into despair once you find out how manipulating time can go horribly wrong. It truly manages to get
                  better every single episode, leaving you wondering what happens next.
This is also the case due to the excellent characters. Whenever there's an anime which portrays 'genius' characters well, you're in for a treat. Because everything happens fast, and it's a battle of wits, you yourself are also trying to find out the next moves of our main character and the supporting cast, which makes for a more enjoyable experience.
The art is alright, and manages to be pretty impressive at times, whilst the soundtrack is somewhat forgetful. With an exception to the opening, which is one of my favourite openings of all time.
Steins;Gate has something for almost everyone, so I would recommend watching it once you have time. It can be slow at the beginning, but over time (pun intended), you will grow to love almost everything about it.",9

                I was purely drawn to watch Steins;Gate because of the amount of love and praise it's already received. I didn't really know anything about the plot or characters as I was going in, so was it worth simply following the hype train for one of the best rated series on this site? 
In short, yes it's been more than worth it. In long, well... I do have a little more to say.
I'll be keeping my review pretty vague and ** spoiler-free ** so people reading this can go into it with roughly the same outset I had.
The first half of the season is very slow,
                  not too slow to a fault, but to the point where I was wondering why this sort of show was getting such immense praise and is a lot of people's favourite. It's very heavily focused on gradually and sensibly introducing characters and character relationships which could have easily been rushed through in a shorter series. Many of the early episodes are structured to focus on one character and their main motivations so the audience can understand how each and every character feels about and bounces off each other to create a lot of very real and personal relationships between them.
However, it becomes clear as you progress further into the series that everything you've seen so far is important to understand what happens past the series' turning point, around episode 12. From here the pace of the show picks up a lot and provides goals that are heavily related to what's already occurred in the first half. It was around this turning point that I admitted I was hooked and regretted doubting the series earlier on. As I mentioned I went into this series fairly blind and didn't expect the time-loop aspect, but I feel like this series handles the concept better than other anime with similar mechanics that shall not be named. 
The main character, whichever name you'd rather call him by (I'll call him Okabe), is fantastic to watch. While some of his eccentricities may seem strange or annoying within the first few episodes, his mad scientist persona really grew on me, especially when he uses it as a cover for a lot of his more natural emotions or other characters mimic it to cheer him up. The acting (from the Japanese VA, I'll likely watch the dub on a rewatch) is so enjoyable, in either serious emotional scenes in which Okabe is filled with dread, despair and self-blame, or hammy mad scientist moments and attempted cool guy Enlglish. That goes for other characters too, I don't think a single one is performed at all badly. The OST is always very fitting for the scene, be it fairly quiet and mysterious for a more serious scene in the lab compared to something casual and light-hearted for a pleasant scene in Akihabara. None of the music distracts from the scene and only adds to the intended atmosphere. 
It's still not a perfect anime, although that may just be my rating system because I find it hard to rate anything as really perfect. As a sci-fi mystery story, specifically involving time-travel, there's always the potential for plot holes and questions that go unanswered, sometimes to a frustrating degree. None of these moments completely ruin the story by any means but it's down to you as an audience member how much you want to question character actions or let those unanswered wonders bother you.
Part of me thinks that episode 22 could have been a heart-breaking ending if it had ended there, though I'm not complaining about how it continued and the alternate ending episode we got. Both endings work great, just for different tones and tastes. 
In the end, I enjoyed this anime an awful lot, however, it took me quite a while to come to that conclusion due to the slower pace. While I did enjoy every episode to some degree I was still left questioning where all the praise comes from until I saw it for myself in the fascinating story, character relationships, and relatable emotions. I even enjoyed the gradually built romance, which I'm usually not a huge fan of. I'd definitely be recommending it to my friends and others after a small warning about the slower beginning, but it's all worth the build-up.",8

                SteinsGate is the second best anime in my opinion, the TimeTravel concept which is directly adapted from real events, namely the event about a man named JohnTitor who claims to be from 2036 who shocked the world in the 2000s then combined with the Thriller genre and very strong Psychological elements and of course demands that we think hard, the difference is if in the real world the original JohnTitor is a man, while in the SteinsGate world, the JohnTitor is a woman AKA SuzuhaAmane. Psychological which discusses the existence / existence of the Multiverse and the possibility of saving someone from death through the
                  creation of a real world branch called the Steins Gate, this anime is very Wow for those of you who really like the Thriller genre with strong Psychological elements but cherry is different. ask if you watch it just to watch or you won't be able to enjoy it mueheheheh.
'' Just Watching Isn't It Really Difficult ?, / Uppss is not that easy Ferguso: v ''
  The only drawback of this anime is the StoryLine which is very stunning but compressed to be very short, which is only at 24 + 1eps (Direct Ending) so that the second season which is very interesting is not as interesting as the first season, of course because of the ending that we already know and the AfterSteinsGate which is separated into Movie (Cie whose brain exploded when SteinsGate: 0 Eps 1-14 hahahahahah üòÇ). It's different if the 2season is directly compressed into one complete unit and directly with SpecialEPS ‚Äã‚Äã`` MissingLink-Divide By Zero '' and MOVIE `` Fuka Ryouiki no DeJavu '' I am sure the antenna will be able to compete with Steel Alchemists Hmmmmm ü§îü§î

                A must watch.
Truly a masterpiece in my opinion. I really love the visual atmosphere of the anime.
Whenever something ""Scientific"" happens in this anime, the feeling of excitement brewing in my chest is a feeling i will never forget from watching this anime. It's the feeling of Mysterious Curiosity that sets this anime apart from all the anime i have ever watched.
Actually i lied. The anime Monster also gave me the exciting Mysterious Curiosity feeling. Other than that, there is not much i could say but to recommend more to give the show a go.
The reason why i give this show a really high rating is
                  probably because i really
might have a bit of interest in sci-fi for example star trek, interstellar, i just really
love these things. Except for Aliens/Predator.",10
"
                This anime has the most suspenseful plotline I have ever witnessed. NO anime I have ever witnessed holds as much suspense as this particular anime does. Trust me, I might sound ¬®Dramatic"" to some right now, but BELIEVE Me when I say this is the most dramatic anime you will ever come across. Don't let the slow beginning part of the silliness of the characters fool you into not getting towards the middle or end of it. And if you still don't believe me, you will once you're at least 5 episodes in. Other than the most ^Intrieging Aspect^ of this anime, the characters themselves
                  hold quite a fair amount of depth and action. The Art style itself is ok and a little more towards the clich√© side of modern anime design, but it still holds some fine artistic moments within moments of the show. I greatly appreciate the realism of this anime, for example, I appreciate the lack of fancy it portrays other than the whole time machine aspect, the mention of Cern and actually covering what Cern has been proven to have actually done in real life, and finally the mention of John Titor, someone who people have claimed to have actually excited within our world. Finally, I would say that Steins;Gate is a 10 out of 10 for me, and so far I have told all of my friends to watch it and they love it.",10
"
                This is the Greatest anime of all time. You cant change my mind no matter what (Im talking about Steins;gate only, excluding the movie and Steins;Gate 0). 
The story starts very slow and has some fillers, but it truly is a fucking masterpiece if i've ever seen one. One of my 10 Favorite anime's and it really deserves all the praise it gets. 
From episode 1-12 it is quite slow and has some fillers, but the plot develops and a Comedy/Drama turns into a Thriller/sci fi type. episode 14-25 are some of the best episodes in anime History. and the Last 3-4 episodes were a
                  Roller Coaster of emotions. the show starts off very slow and becomes very intense and thrilling at one point. 
Highly recommended to everyone",10
"
                Steins;Gate Is a masterpiece there isnt even much more to say.
The best part about this show is the characters they are all so loveable. They all have their own quirks and personallities that are enjoyable to see. There is so much witty and funny dialog that just the characters interacting is such a joy to see. Now to the timetravel aspect of the show it is done  so phenominal. One of my main problems with shows involving time travel is usually its an after thought that just gets added in and just convoludes things and adds plot wholes, but in steinsgate the whole show
                  revolves around it making it done perfectly.
Now i will be honnest the show starts out with some mystery to intrigue you but is also really slow to burn. The show starts to get interesting a couple episodes in so that can turn some people away but by the tme you get about halfway through the show you will be hooked speaking that you dont know spoilers. This show is amazing the the spoilers can really ruin it imo. I have personnaly watched the show 5 times and enjoyed it everytime but the first 2 or so times hit different. 
This is a show with amazing characters that you will get attached to and with a well thought out story and if you havn't watched it by now I dont know what you are doing. If you like witty dialog, SciFi, tsunderes, and good story then this show is for you
This show i think the less you know the more you will enjoy it but heres a quick plot summary withought many spoilers at all
Short Summary:
To Keep the stroy short the story follows hououin kyouma a scientist who really loves what he's doing and is suspicous of everyone. When eventually they make a device that is able to alter the past. The whole group has to then deal with all the changes that occured from messing with the past and fixing the world that they live in.",10
"
                At early episodes, I was flooded with lots of information that I couldn't handle. But as the story goes on  I started to understand it very well. The story in the middle episodes becomes very thrilling and it doesn't disappoint me till the very end. The anime is very well balanced with character development, comedy and a little bit of romance as well. 
I noticed at the end of anime that this was probably the best anime with no real bad guys. The only enemy the characters had was their own curiosity of time traveling. When they realized the consequences of their experiments they
                  put everything on the line to go back and undo everything to save something very important. The story is full of twists and surprises. And you won't regret watching Steins;Gate.",9
"
                Listen-up. I don‚Äôt know why I waited so long to watch Steins Gate, but anyway I am incredibly glad I ultimately ended up seeing it. It is one of the few anime that I have seen and afterwards felt a tingling sense of satisfaction. Undoubtedly a near-perfect 24-episode show, Steins Gate dwells between the 9 to 10 range. I‚Äôm gonna give it a 9 in relativity to the other masterclass anime, but if I had seen it earlier on in my anime spree, I would have certainly given it a 10. Let me tell you why: 
1) Storyline: Steins Gate is, at face value, a
                  well crafted show about time-travel. Overall, the show is about the journey of Okabe Rintarou, a mad-scientist, who discovers how to time travel and then faces the various consequences of his actions, drawing in his fellow lab members in the process. First, good time-travel pieces need to have a balance of both complexity and simplicity to create a sense of enjoyment - which Steins Gate certainly has. The anime certainly entertains detailed and systematic (despite the seemingly fictional aspect) of time travel theory, while not delving too much into the science. At the same time, the simplicity from the lives of the main characters, say Rintarou/Mayuri/Kurisu, keep the show light and create a beautiful emotional attachment. What I truly love is that the art of relationships between the lab members: by not focusing too much on each of the lab members and keeping the show going at a natural pace, the anime automatically allows the viewer to understand the dynamic between lab members. 
True - the plot begins with the a wild first episode, which only makes sense through the final episode, giving a certain hook that keeps the series alive. Also, the entire show is full of surprising and incredibly interesting plot twists and developments. Yet there is a slight (and I really do mean slight) problem with the plot for me: it does not get intense until 12 episodes in. For anyone who will watch the show, you will immediately know what I mean‚Ä¶and so in that regard Steins Gate is really a two part show, despite it only being a 24-episode anime. That being said, the soft beginning allows for the characters to express their true selves, and the intense ending puts those emotions to the test. 
2) What makes a person a person? For those who read my reviews, you will know that I often love to (at least humbly try to) dissect one key philosophical idea from each good anime that I watch. In Steins Fate, a situation occurs where Rintarou, who eventually travels between ‚Äòworld lines,‚Äô constantly meets his friends who have entirely different memories each time he sees them. So, the question arises: are these friends the same people in each ‚Äòuniverse‚Äô? The answer that I found particularly compelling both intellectually (in terms of the show‚Äôs plot) and emotionally was ‚Ä¶ yes. They are the same people. But why? Because being an individual is based off of one‚Äôs convictions, and since those convictions are pure and transcendent of time, every time one meets that person, they are the same character. What a concept!
3) Characters - Again, I feel something that this anime does quite well is balance out the dynamic between complexity and simplicity. That is highly visible in nearly all the characters, however it is especially evident in Okabe Rintarou. Okabe certainly maintains a light personality and goofy personality, however that side of him masks his innately caring and curious self. Not a perfectly crafted character (as there are a few scenes that depart from this norm), he still holds the show together and is the perfect bridge and adhesive for the lab. The certain ‚Äúisms‚Äù about Okabe are funny and keep the anime afloat during the stormy aspects of the plot. The name ‚ÄúSteins Gate‚Äù is a testament in and of itself. Honestly, the reason that Okabe has made the list of my favorite anime characters is because to a certain extent, I find it important to have a balance between the light and serious aspects of life - without it, life is either meaningless (too light) or dull (too serious). I personally do not feel that any character deserves a serious explication‚Ä¶except maybe Mayuri, but I will leave that for someone else to delve into.
4) Sound and Art - The intro and ending sequences are phenomenal. If you are a true anime fan, I assume that you watch the sequences anyway. But if you don‚Äôt (and you prefer not to), I implore you to watch them in Steins Gate. The songs, animation, and emotional enterprise complement the show. For a 2011 anime, the animation is quite good - nothing too extraordinary yet nothing too bland. Good enough for the anime to do its thing.
So what does this all mean? Listen, you don‚Äôt have to watch it today or tomorrow. It‚Äôs not a 10. But you certainly do have to watch it somewhere in the (hopefully near) future. If you call yourself an ‚Äòanime fan,‚Äô it most certainly merits your time.",9
"
                How can one dislike Steins;Gate? Easy answer, you just don‚Äôt. Disliking Steins;Gate should be considered a felony the moment you finish it. This series has a really fulfilling ending, one that you‚Äôll be jumping out of your seat once you see it, and it‚Äôs even more like that once you get to Steins;Gate 0. 
Steins;Gate has a really compelling cast of characters that really drag you into the universe, making you feel like one of the lab members. The humor, mixed with the suspense of what's to come, plus all of the other amazing shit, puts this in my top 3 of anime.

                If you're familiar with other series that involve time travel, this won't be too different. However, there are a few things here and there that make it interesting. 
Another thing I personally like is how everyone is so connected and the ""wtf"" moments that it gave birth to. 
Sure, there was a textbook tsundere character here, but that wasn't enough for me to hate anything about the series or even the character herself. 
Overall, this series made my emotions get all crumpled up and thrown around, but were ironed out later. It was quite the adventure. I do suggest you give it a try, though
                  I had to force myself past the first two or three episodes to really enjoy it. Don't give up!",9
"
                Let me start by saying that Science Fiction in anime is something that should be explored more. Steins;Gate is one of those anime series that is brave enough to use such a plot device, and actually succeeds in telling a story about time travel that it would make Nolan blush.
First off, the story focuses on Okabe Rintaro and his friends as they try out their own ridiculous research projects and eventually they chance upon a device that allows them to send messages to the past, which alters the future. This causes other underground organizations to target Okabe and his friends as they attempt to steal
                  his invention. As Okabe learns about this, he tries to alter the timeline to save his friends. It is simple, it is complex when it needs to, and it builds this great bond and friendship/romance between the characters.
As for the characters, they are a colorful bunch, each with their own desires and dreams, feeling a lot more like real people rather than a bunch of pointless anime tropes. You get to hang out with them and learn a lot about them throughout the series and as the plot unfolds, you get actually emotional and root for Okabe to succeed in his journey.
Overall, I do think this anime really captures the imagination of science fiction, combines it with anime and really brings out the best in both. It may not be perfect (a close 9 in reality perhaps) but as a fan of science fiction and stories about time travel, it hits a 10 for me.",10

                ""hmm... this show's popular, must be really good...""
*watches Steins;gate*
""alright... let me just send a D-mail to the past saying to watch this sooner.""
--THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS--
You really wanted to mess with people's brains, didn't you? I was especially confused at the end of Steins;gate 0. But that's not what I want to talk about. God, the story, the characters, the emotions... I cried at least 5 times while watching this show. It's funny how they make you get used to the characters and then just kill them off like...
When Moeka shot Mayuri, that was especially heartbreaking.
I knew Kyoma (Okabe? Rintarou? Hououin? I honestly have no
                  clue how to call him) was going to time leap and save her. But the way it was executed was... well-
It takes time to get used to the story. It's confusing at first, some people even said it's boring. But if you manage to keep watching, it gets so damn good.
The part that had me in shock was when ""Hououin Kyoma returned"" in Steins;gate 0 after being depressed as hell. I didn't even realize how much I missed his alter ego after it disappeared. At first, this anime was all fun and games, the characters were just messing around, mocking each other, enjoying their time in the lab... until it got so dark I forgot how it used to be in the beginning. Hououin Kyoma's return opened my eyes, damn, I suddenly felt like I was watching the first season again. The way his return was executed was excellent, it made me cry tears of joy.
Another thing I want to mention are the female characters. They aren't just annoying little ""baka"" tsundere girls who can't do anything without the help of the mc. Kurisu - a genius who invented a time machine. Mayuri - a great friend who kept supporting Okarin, no matter what was going on. Suzuha - a girl who wanted to save the world, save everyone, even if it meant sacrificing herself. Kagari - an amazing fighter. Moeka - even though she was an anti-hero (or a villain? honestly I don't even know), she still had courage and was brave. Faris - even though not a main character, she was really strong and kind, helping others when needed. This anime had male and female characters balanced and that's also why people should appreciate this show.
It's very easy to get lost in the story if you don't pay attention. There are so many time jumps and complications... but it all makes sense in the end and ends well, and that's all I've ever wanted. I may watch this again, in another time line...

                ""It's the choice of Steins Gate.""
At first, Steins;Gate is an anime about time travelling and the effects of altering the past. However, this anime is about much more. 
Story: The story of this anime is pretty basic at first glance. Dude makes random inventions, accidentally discovers it does more than intended, and stuff occurs. But under that is even more. It's about how your choices change your destiny. It's about the lengths and dangers one will go to save the things they love. But anyways, back to the review. I loved the story in this anime, even if it starts off a bit slow in
                  the beginning.
Art: The art in this anime is amazing. The effects used when travelling through time or sending a D-Mail always looks trippy and well made. I also enjoyed all the shading used when the characters are in dark places, and I also enjoyed when the art style changed suddenly in one of the episodes later on in the series.
Character: The characters in this story are well developed, and it seems that every character, even minor, have a role in this main plot. Even Mr. Braun has a role in this plot. Anyways, the characters in this anime all have a special place in my heart.
especially you Christina a.k.a. The Zombie a.k.a. Celeb 17, etc.
Enjoyment: This anime was very enjoyable, and kept me interested throughout most of the episodes. Although slow in the beginning, it picks up at a gradual rate after they send their first D-Mail. But to wrap up this review, I'd like to say one thing. Steins;Gate is one of the more darker animes, and I'd only recommend this to those ready for this kind of anime. But anyways, if you haven't watched this already, I highly recommend you do right now.",9
"
                I like a few time travel anime, my favorites would have to be Erased and Orange. This is neither of those. I can respect that because we don't see how the Delorean works other than using garbage, plutonium and a flux capacitor; We don't see a logical explanation in Erased or in Orange either, but it's fine for those respective stories because you basically just have to say ""Time travel exists"" and everybody will understand what you're talking about. I'm not big into the more science related stuff, where they get nitty gritty about the actual creation of the time machine but this does it
                  in an entertaining yet smart way, making the time machine is not the point of the anime. 
A regular description of this anime wasn't enough to get me into it so let me rephrase it to peak your interest. They put bananas in a microwave and it turns to green slime. If that doesn't peak your interest then you could also say that it's an immersive anime that focuses on character development and uses time travel to do it, there, does that sound better?
I could've seen this as super serious and dark and complicated and that kept me from starting it all this time but I was wrong, this is a build-up anime. It has a really nice balance of where to be humorous and where to be serious. It starts out kind of aspiring but then works its way up and weaves itself in, making it all the more creepier during those parts, I was very much on the edge of my seat during some of the reveals. It's a smart anime but it doesn't make you feel lost or anything more like ""Why didn't I think of that? It was right in front of me."" it's funny because the time travel is easy to digest yet the actual story is complex. It's original, something I haven't seen in either a story or time travel as of yet.
Now let me break it down. Our main is an average conspirator named Kyouma who thinks he's smarter than everyone else and challenges them. He's a scientist and calls himself an ""evil genius"" but ends up being more like an Invader Zim character. I could see where this is based from a visual novel, taking the time to focus on individual characters is almost like how that specific romantic route would go in a dating sim, surprisingly they make it flow well enough to not make it seem separate or chopped up, it seems like a natural progression of story and while you could argue that some of the women fall all over Kyouma, it actually makes him a bit of a better character, almost like he was meant to be annoying before and after you see everything, you start to feel bad for him and see his growth as well as almost wishing you had those little annoying moments back.
It seems to get better and better as it goes on but episode 7 threw it in for me at the very end of the episode because of how Kyoma is ""the chosen one"", it's absurd that first off, the weakest character of this anime is so powerful and second off, that there even is a 'chosen one' in the first place, it's an overused cliche. Then it really goes off the deep end with the next episode trying to change a boy to a girl?
I'm not a conspiracy theorist and certainly not one as crazy as Kyouma but I've always found different dimensions and stuff of the sort, interesting, making this anime scratch that itch. I like an that anime sets its rules then follows them, that's probably the best thing about this being more science related. I don't quite get how the phone thing works but that's alright, I expect that kind of glossing.
Kurisu is the red haired girl, she's pretty much a tsundere even though she proclaims that she's not. I thought maybe the color in the animation looked washed out from the promos but watching it, it seems fine, I feel like part of it was to get Kurisu's hair to stick out more.
She's not the best girl though...Suzuha is! She is easily my favorite because it seems like every character has their own secrets (except maybe Kyouma because he can't keep his mouth shut) but hers is the most interesting throughout, not to mention her charismatic personality ""Wassup!"" then skidding around on her bike and being quick to make sure everything's alright. (You see why later in the anime but even without it she's cool)
Mayuri is a childish girl, probably my favorite design wise but every time we see her she goes ""Do-Do-Do"" as if it's the Victory Fanfare from Final Fantasy, it gets kind of annoying. It's weird though, she talks that way to most of her friends but she seems different towards the end of her arc, like the tone of her voice, her choice of words, everything seems...better than before. It's true that each character gets better as it goes on but she just seems like she's putting on an act for most of it yet it's not outright said or made a part of the plot.
So what's a con of this anime? It fits in with both character and story, yet I wouldn't call it a con but more of a system of engagement. It drags you apart just to build you up again for very joyful moments to go back to very sad ones, it's quite a mix, in fact I might even consider them equally balanced, it's a heart-wrenching anime but by the end it becomes apparent that it's not building you up just to break you down again, it makes you question what matters at times. It's just showing you the struggle and that struggle is one I might have to recover from because of its immersion. I felt attached and like I couldn't turn back but I feel like it was intended. 
I could see American movies taking inspiration from it like Edge of Tomorrow (This is so much better though) and I could also see Brad Bird watching this when he made Tomorrowland because of the pins and tube clock idea.
I might give Steins;Gate 0 a try as well as the movie, not because I didn't like the ending, I loved the ending, but just to see more Steins;Gate. This is a 9 out of 10, you can see the amount of detail they put into the story, I now understand what the hype is about. It has no business being as good as it is, yet it is.",9
"
                Story: 9
The concept of exploring time travel and its implications along with some social commentary such as the difficulty of gender identity issues that is present within Steins; Gate makes the story thought-provoking and entertaining. However, Steins; Gate does not answer some questions adequately such as ""Why is Okabe so interested in science?"" ""What is the green goo? etc.
Art: 7
The art uses unique coloration and perspective at times which keeps things interesting in uninteresting places such as an urban city. However, I wish that at non-critical points of the story the setting was more interesting. Character design is great.
Sound: 6
Music was not memorable. When an
                  anime has a good soundtrack, I go and listen to it. I haven't done that for Steins; Gate ever. However, there were moments in Steins; Gate, where I would actually laugh at the voice acting. The voice actors are great at capturing the emotion and quirkiness of the characters they portray.
Characters: 9
The characters in Steins; Gate are mostly interesting: a great example is Okabe. The characters in Steins; Gate are also lovable: a great example of this is Mayuri. However, some characters in Steins; Gate bored me: a notable example being Kurisu. Kurisu is bae? More like go away.
Overall Enjoyment: 8
Overall,  Steins; Gate has an interesting story, the memes are great, the characters are mostly great (except your shit waifu), what's not to like?",8
"
                One of the first thing I have noticed when watching the series is how slow it is for it to pick up and actually become enjoyable. Once you make it past this ""leap"" of development, you will become incredibly invested. 
It takes around five or six episodes for you to really become attached to the characters enough for you to become invested into finishing. By this time, the humor and the characters are simply amusing. 
A few episodes after that is when the drama starts picking up. The characters you become attached to start to be in danger, sacrifices have to be made for everyone's
                  safety including their happiness, and the greatest antagonist in the story slowly makes itself known and powerful for a random, genius but heavily flawed, scientist to take on but he has no choice for only he knows what is going on and can do something about it. 
The story is very slow, but once you're invested you will not want to put this down and you too will most likely later call yourself a fan.",9

                The second half is undoubtedly a masterpiece, flawless in virtually every aspect. The first half however, is an absolute chore to get through. The pacing is horrendously slow and I struggled to keep my eyes open for the first 10 or so episodes, and it's something that cannot be excused, no matter how mindblowing the second half may be. 
The story is fantastic overall; it is certainly one of the most unique and complex sci-fi animes I've ever watched, and it's definitely a show that requires rewatching. Again, the first half I found to be very uninteresting but at the same time I really appreciated
                  how the ending tied everything we saw at the very beginning in a logical and satisfying manner. Once the story got going, it was very hard to stop watching, I just wished it picked up sooner. 
The art is pretty good; nothing too special but it was pleasing to look at.
Sound is pretty great; voice acting is immaculate, and the OP and ED are great. 
The characters are by far the best part of the anime. Okarin is one of the best MCs I've ever seen, Makise is one of my favorite anime girls ever, and the other characters like Mayuri, Daru, Amane and Ruka were all very fun to watch. I never found any character to be boring or annoying at any point, and if the characters weren't absolutely amazing as they are I would have dropped this by episode 3. Their interactions and character development were a delight to watch. 
Overall, even though I actually did drop this anime at one point, I'm glad I decided to try again and power through it, as it is a uniquely entertaining and complex anime that I was able to enjoy quite thoroughly despite never having played the original visual novel.",8

                Widely considered to be one of the greatest Visual Novels and Anime series of all time, I had to watch Steins;Gate despite being a bigger fan of the shonen demographic.
I'm gonna be honest, I had very high expectations before getting into the series, however, after having finished watching Steins;Gate, I can safely say that it didn't only manage to live up to my expectations; it surpassed them.
The story is so goddamn intriguing, I couldn't stop watching. It has a slightly slow - albeit highly entertaining - start but it only gets better. It's an absolutely beautiful story overall with a lot of twists and turns,
                  and it handles the concept of time travel surprisingly well.
Also, the characters - particularly the main characters - are very likable and engaging, and the dialogue & character interactions are amazing.
Aside from the story and the characters though, Steins;Gate doesn't really have anything else going on for it, but it doesn't really need anything else because it manages to excel in both story and characters.
Besides, the opening theme is very good too, so that's a plus.
Now, you could say Steins;Gate is pretty much perfect, and I somewhat agree, however, I feel like the main antagonist of the series lacks enough appearance and impact despite playing a very important role in the story. It's not a major flaw but I think it's worth mentioning.
Pros:
+ Compelling & deep story
+ Focused and well-executed concept
+ Great characters
Cons:
- Uninteresting antagonist
Final Rating: 10/10
- Masterpiece -
Steins;Gate is a psychological, narrative masterpiece and a timeless classic, and it's such a blast to watch, I wouldn't mind watching it for a second time.
Do I recommend it?:
It's a must-watch, and I highly recommend it to shonen Anime fans as well.",10

                being a guy of science it really satisfies my hunger for time paradox and theories the concepts of time traveling in the science world is pretty massive and to satisfy the hunger this is the perfect show to watch though I am very late in order to watch it 
 I really appreciate the thought of bringing this to live
the sound and art design is very well made the character shades with their flaws
gives it a  natural feel the dialogues are well written and   delivered but it lacks the connectivity with its own subtitle
I like my animes to be subbed and dubbed
                  
the blend of both matters the most
which enhances the flavor of watching
except that I like to conclude that this is an amazing show 
it is a must-watch 
it's worth sharing with friends and family 
it's totally my opinion there is no intention to hurt anyone through this review if my review hurt you in any way I am sorry

                I really enjoied the original Visual Novel, so I must be strict.
THIS IS A NO SPOILER REVIEW. 
PROS: 
-Very engaging story (like the Visual Novel);
-Excellent voice actors (the same from the Visual Novel);
-Music scores from the Visual Novel;
-The source material is almost excellent, very engaging and well made. The choice of using the True Ending of the VN is correct, but it brought several problem in the adaptation (I will discuss the bad aspects later in the review).
-Also the choice of using the original voice actors/actresses from the VN was genious. Always giving their best (even with all the mistakes in the writing phase).
-Last, using some of the original scores from the VN was a pleasant surprise, but I had to wait to much for them...
CONS:
-Uninspired anime OST;
-Overall bad directed;
-Overall bad animated, bad drawn, most of the time unexpressive characters;
-Abysmal photography and cromaric choices all of the times;
-Bad paced;
-Mediocre adaptation;
-Mediocre writing and story telling compared to the Visual Novel.
-The original OST for the anime is far than memorable, you will not be able to remember a single score.
-The direction is not what I had in mind before watching it: It's lazy, extremely lazy. Just the basics to not bore the viewers, with a lot of boring expositions scenes, that could have been made interesting if they were left in the laboratory (Like in the VN) and not in some clich√® anime locations.
-The animations are far from good, whit a lot of low quality drawings, and the slightly altered character design from the original transformed the very human teenagers from the VN in a sort of robots with a limited gamma of expressions. Luckly the actors did their best and saved the day.
-The photography and color palette is the worst things in this adaptation. Whites, whites everywhere. Where are the sunsets from the VN? Where are the colors and shines of Akiba? It looked like this new Akiba has come straight out of Mirror's Edge. It was boring and repetitive. Oh, and don't forget the dark places... Looks like Akiba is a place with full lights or full shadows. Nothing more.
-Pacing, adaptation, writing and story telling goes together. Some important plot points that looked dumb in the VN where skipped, making hard for the viewers to relates with some secondary characters and develope a minimum of sympathy for them: Why should I feel sorry for all the secondary charachers, when Okabe does what he has to do, when they had the same screentime as some of the extras around the streets? These resulted in somehow rushed pace in key points during the narration.
I could understand they wanted to skip them because they didn't have to feed the viewers with all the alternatives endings of the VN, but they were important simply to create sympathy with the secondary characters and to feel the same as Okabe when he must do what he has to do.
FINAL SCORE: 5
MY THOUGH:
How could you f*ck up so bad with that excellent source material?",5

                There is absolutely nothing bad to say about this show.
Okay, let me rephrase that: there ARE some bad things you could say about this show, but in the end, none of them have a great enough effect to make it any less enjoyable than it is, and it IS one of the most enjoyable shows I have ever watched.
If you came for story, hang on to your seat. This show uses an age-old idea, transforms it into something unique, and then proceeds to use this idea to create some of the most dramatic scenarios in anime history. The plot of this show is fun, exciting,
                  mysterious, heart-wrenching, and in all ways an absolute work of genius. Take my word for it.
The art doesn't do anything incredibly flashy, but Steins;Gate has a comfortable, consistent style that suits it very, very well. There is one scene that is a bit trippy, but I think it was dramatically appropriate at the time, so I'm willing to ignore it.
The opening theme for this show is really cool, and I listened to it many times. It fits, it sounds great, and you don't need anything more than that. Music during the show is very appropriate as well, and blended so fitfully into the background that it made every scene even more dramatic without me even noticing the first time I watched.
Though not every character is as fleshed out as the main character(s), they all have great personalities, and you'll learn to love every single one of them by the end of the show, especially Okabe Rintarou, who goes by the wacky alias of Hoouin Kyoma. You might think he's a total idiot at first, but he quickly becomes amusing, then endearing, then genuinely likeable, and finally just flat-out cool.
I can't say anything about this show other than WATCH IT. And watch it soon, so you can agree with me and I can stop trying to convince you that it's more than well worth your time.",10

                Time travel is such a gratifying concept. Hearing someone mention time travel alone gets me all excited. After all, it is beyond our understanding. How are we supposed to know if our predictions about time travel are real if we have not experienced the phenomenon ourselves? Curiosity is in human nature, and, naturally, time travel is just the thing that boosts it. If you‚Äôre not into time travel, why are you even here? 
Steins;Gate gives another dive into time travel and brings many bizarre questions at hand: 
‚Äúis time travel real?‚Äù
‚Äúdo time machines work?‚Äù 
And by answering those questions, we are given an interesting group
                  of characters: 
Okabe Rintarou - I mean, Kyouma Hououin is rather an odd individual who loves to talk about science and has a paranoia that an organization is after him to make him seem cool. Behind that eccentricity, however, is an extremely smart man. How can you not like him?
Mayuri Shiina - A cute cosplayer and best girl. Likes to pose in front of nowhere and lifts her arm up to the sky as if she were reaching the stars in broad daylight. Honestly though, she‚Äôs very cute. 
Daru - A gigachad who has an obsession with 2d woman and is named ‚Äúhaker‚Äù by Rintarou. Sadly enough, he only has 1,000 favorites on MyAnimeList. He‚Äôs pretty cool if you ask me. 
Makise Kurisu - Basically everyone‚Äôs favorite girl. (Everyone, including me). I mean, whats there to not like? I would do anything for this woman‚Ä¶
There‚Äôs more but honestly if you really want to know more about the other characters in the series you might as well start watching. 
If you‚Äôre wondering, there‚Äôs actually a very cool way to watch the series after watching episode 22. I‚Äôm watching the series this way, and I suggest you follow this if you want to have fun with the series. I will put it here: (yes, I DID copy this off of someone) 
EVERYONE WHOS WATCHING EP 22 LISTEN!
follow this order:
1.Watch Steins;Gate Episode 1‚Äì22 (so finish this ep then continue on to the alternative episode of 23, which is named below)
2.Watch Steins;Gate: Kyoukaimenjou no Missing Link - Divide By Zero/Steins Gate: Episode 23 (Œ≤); Open the Missing Link (this is the alternative ep of 23, u must watch this before the actual ep 23, U MUST!)
3.Watch Steins;Gate 0 (complete 0, basically a s2)
4.Watch Steins;Gate Episode 23‚Äì24 (once u finish Steins;Gate 0, come back and complete the original ep of 23 and then watch ep 24)
5.Watch Steins;Gate: Oukoubakko no Poriomania/Steins;Gate: Egoistic Poriomania (once completed those, watch this lil ova)
6.Watch Steins;Gate Movie: Fuka Ryouiki no D√©j√† vu/Steins;Gate: The Movie ‚àí Load Region of D√©j√† Vu (and for the final step, watch the movie!)
7. Also i forgot to mention, u may watch the special ova for steins;gate 0. its pretty cute tho.
Please listen and follow these steps, its much more enjoyable, TRUST ME!",10

                Oh boy, I've been waiting to sink my teeth into this one, as this might be one of the few reviews of this show from someone who played the original visual novel before watching it. And in having played it, there are definitely a large number of problems that I wouldn't have noticed otherwise.
I'm going to cover story last since there's A LOT to review there.
Art- 8/10: This anime's art is faithful to its source material in a similar way to that of Jojo Part 4; very faithful in terms of colors, but no faith in design. The color scheme is very dull and gritty
                  similar to the backgrounds in the VN. But the real brilliance is in the lighting. The lighting in this show is done in such a way to give the show a constant film noir feel even in broad daylight, and even though the VN wasn't like that at all, it still felt Steins;Gate-ish in a way.
The downside is that all the characters have been stripped of all texture they had in the VN and look as low budget as a bad Toei production. But due to the other good stuff I mentioned earlier, I got over this problem pretty quickly. If only I could say that about the other problems I have with this show...
Sound- 6/10: First off, the seiyuus are phenomenal. They happen to sound exactly like the characters in the game, and whether or not they outright WERE the same seiyuus in the first place was something I couldn't confirm. Regardless, their voice acting is top notch.
The reason I gave sound such a low score was the music! The music choices were horribly inconsistent. For some reason, White Fox couldn't decide if they wanted to use original compositions- most of which sounded like music from a stock website- or to just insert tracks from the original VN- which were genius compositions that give Steins;Gate its own identity. I was prepared to deal with all original compositions, but when the VN's title theme 'Gate of Steiner' played at the end of the first episode, I was like, ""Really?"".
The only consistency that was par for the course was to have Itou Kanakou perform the show's opening, which was actually a new composition by the name of 'Hacking to the Gate'. It's a lot poppier than I would like compared to the urgency of the VN's OP track. But guess what! You can decide which OP you like better since the VN's OP ends up making a guest appearance in this show anyway!
In all seriousness, the amount of times that they just insert tracks from the VN drove me bonkers throughout the whole thing.
Characters- 8/10: The characters in Steins;Gate are all weirdos, especially the main character. But all the weird traits that they each have makes them really easy to remember.
I guess the real problem with them is that certain individuals are only important to the central plot due to... well... happenstance I guess. Later the story will get to a point where they each get exclusive screen time and in my opinion, that's the portion I enjoy the least, mainly because two of the individuals involved are my least favorite. Also, it might feel a bit forced, which is more of a problem towards the anime than the VN, since VN's by nature have giant walls of text.
Story- 9/10: The story of Steins;Gate, the visual novel at least, is practically perfect in every way. The rules governing the series are plausible and are adhered to by the events of the story. I mean, in the end, you still have to suspend disbelief over the idea of a microwave time machine, but it's still easier to do that than with most stories of this ilk. 
The ending of the show, or the True Ending for the VN, is probably a divisive point. I'm in the minority when I say that I feel mixed about how it played out. You'd think that it's a case of ham-fisted deux ex machina stuff, but it IS necessary in order to tie up EVERY loose end and it is properly foreshadowed. I feel like that they were forced to end it the way they did because of 'the fandom' but the way they went about it was perhaps the best way they could've done it. Honestly, you most likely won't have a problem with it.
So if I thought the story was practically perfect, then why did I give it a 9/10 here? Well...
The Concessions that White Fox Made- 3/10: My chief complaint with the VN was that I found it too easy to deduce almost every plot twist ahead of time, which stinks for something in which you're meant to figure stuff out ALONGSIDE the characters. But because of what VN's are by nature, everything had to be conveyed through text, so it was really hard to be cryptic or subtle. In an anime, they can do all kinds of things, like hide clues in plain sight, or since they had to axe a lot of dialogue, just axe most of the dialogue that outright gave away later plot twists.
And, well, they did do that a couple of times. But most of the time, THEY MADE IT EVEN WORSE.
Not only is ALL of the dialogue that points toward plot points still there, but they even add ADDITIONAL dialogue that points even further toward the truth, and in a very forced and unnatural way. There are even times when they take one of the few subtle clues given by the VN and make them obvious!
Also, the pacing of this show is really something. The first episode PLOWS through the VN's HOUR LONG prologue in eight minutes, giving you NO TIME to absorb what had occurred. But other times, they beat around the bush A LOT and add filler scenes just to end off on a juicy ciffhanger, or in the case of the Chapter 10 portion of the show, make so that it was long enough to be two episodes, when Chapter 10 was already enough beating around the bush in of itself.
They could've gotten rid of all those scenes of beating around the bush, and that would give them enough time to elaborate on the complex but believable science in which the story operates around. A large amount of that stuff got axed. 
Heck, you wanna know what else got axed? The explanation for one of the defining attributes of the main character- something far more important than his personality! I mean, the VN's explanation is only conjecture, but it's SOMETHING! In axing those two lines of dialogue White Fox created a MASSIVE plot hole where there was not one before. And that's not even the worst part! 
The part that covers Chapter 9... WOW, how they've butchered Chapter 9... On one hand, they axe a fairly inconsequential side plot that only served to tick off completionists. But on the OTHER hand, they axe one of the most dynamic character relationships IN THE WHOLE STORY, which ends up playing DIRECTLY into the actions done by a certain individual at that point. Without that, it seems like a forced, ham-fisted, rushed MESS of plot.
There are even parts where they change the order of events in ways that MAKE NO SENSE. (I'm looking at YOU, end of Episode 14!) It's confusing enough to watch this show as it is, and they make it EVEN MORE CONFUSING?
White Fox, why?
Directing- 10/10: After all that I've complained about, everything else about this show is FANTASTIC. The use of camera angles and jump cuts and sound and light are all superb. There are a lot of just weird and interesting... things that they do in this show, and I really don't want to mention them just so you can see them for yourself. But man, it's so cool some of the stuff they did.
Overall- 9/10: I really wanted to give this anime a perfect score. Steins;Gate's anime could've stood on equal ground with its VN counterpart, or even surpassed it. 
But with all the inconsistent sound choices, and them making changes where they shouldn't have, and leaving the parts where they should've changed it the same, this show doesn't even fall short from the VN; it falls flat. And yet... I see myself returning to this version of Steins;Gate over the VN. I guess it's because you're guaranteed the True Ending when you put the show on, or the time effectiveness between a 24 episode show versus a 30 hour game, but I could easily end up watching this many times in the future, maybe with friends.
This is still one of the better anime on the market, and you can't go wrong with this one in the end. But I highly recommend you play the visual novel before the last computers that can run it become too old, because if Steins;Gate teaches you any life lessons, it's that obtaining an old computer is really hard!",9

                This anime is a definately a 10 star show ......for people who don't know anything about physics, are new to sci-fi and anime, and can't seem to notice the plot holes in story and the unrealistic shallow one dimensional characters.
It's not a bad show. 
Story is fine, for an anime. Not much of surprise elements in it.howerver pace is too darn slow. I saw first 10 eps last year , got bored , dropped it , then picked it up yesterday to complete it cause later half seemd much better than the first. But again at the end it starts to look repetitive and meaningless.
                  
Romance is shit. And looks forced . And they don't look compatible at all together. Okabe and Mayuri will make better couple in terms of acting like 10 year olds tryna pretend playing through their problems .
Characters , they are one dimensional. MC is so annoying in first 12 eps and in later half he is miserable. You can't help but think he is good for nothing, without kirisu and daru and other characters he is pretty useless and of no value. He isn't funny either. ... I was thinking somewhere in between the anime that it had been a more interesting story if daru was main character. 
Kirisu start out as a cool character but in her tsundere mode she is same like Okabe. Mayuri......is the most annoying. She is a complete worthless piece of animation, at a point I was thinking all this mess for saving this girl. Who won't do anything other than acting like a 5 year old and getting sad over people fighting or screaming. Other characters are way forgettable . Character development is none except for Okabe maybe , which looks forced.
Art is average
Sound ..... Opening is good. Background music when some romantic moment is going on is cringey as shit. 
I just don't like this anime is considered as sci-fi. It is pure fantasy where people are randomly speaking whatever scientific term they like, in terms of science it got too many of things that I can't overlook. 
Let me explain-
Large hardon collider aka LHC is an accelerator which was made to accelerate particals to a perticular velocity to collide them with other particles and purpose of the whole thing is to break down atom and discovering new sub particles.
It can create black holes. 
And blackholes can't compress the data you send it. How you send it? This show made me choke on my food when I heard them saying they gonna send the memory to LHC from where black hole will compress the memory data to transferable size and send( wow blackhole send it back, black hole from which even light waves /photons can't escape , something with speed of light can't escape, I'm pretty sure the data transfer waves are of less velocity and more wavelength). so send It back to their phone microwave data transfering machine from which it gets sent to past. Haha , and viewers are completely buying this. Well of course cause they have no idea what these characters are talking about.
How does it gets transferred to brain. Just by keeping their phone near their ear. And a headphone like thing can capture you memories from temporal lobe? 
What's more , main characters memories are transferred to past. The point where it is sent should end up dividing the time line. One where memories aren't transferred and one where memories are. So what happens to main character without the memory in different time line is never discussed and of course they won't let dumb viewers get the clue of it too by never mentioning it.
And you get to remember events from different timelines it's funny that they only seem to point this out when they need to use this as a tool to progress plot. On the other side , CERN organization never get their share of memories that they were about to capture the time machine ....
A satellite crashed on a building and nobody investigate it?
What is even more disappointing is that , if you try to imagine the situation from CERN organization perspective , it seems like organization isn't that serious about retrieving the thing. It's is used only for making the situation serious when maker likes it. Organization which is gonna rule in near future should be more agressive than it really is? No?
 so many plot holes and so much of technobabble that you stop caring about the sci-fi part and just ride through it like zombie. At the end , it didn't matter to me if one of the character dies or lives making the major part of the anime meaningless to me",7

                Hey.
-----Quick reasons why I can't keep watching an 8/10 rated anime-----
I can't write a big review on that because I have only seen half of it and I will not watch it to the end.
Because I'm unable to take these bad jokes over and over again (and seeing same personality characters from other animes here or other way around). First few episodes are 10/10 or 9/10 and it slowly gets killed by the terrible jokes.
-----Some Quick ratings by me (The Mr Nobody) and more info-----
-Characters are nice I guess.
-Voice acting is nice and unique in some ways.-Don't remember the sound. (Watched it months ago).
I enjoyed the story how it makes you think in some places but I can't comment more on that because yeah. Only 14 episodes. Everything started to go down there. Meaning that the story started and stuff started to happen.
This anime is probably really good. But if you can't take the terrible jokes what anime culture has in almost every anime. Then the ratings kind of go down. (And character explanation later).
That's the reason I stopped watching. I would rate it probably 6/10 or 7/10 at the end.
-----Similar to other animes-----
(The jokes are similar to
Jujutsu Kaisen
Bungou Stray Dogs
Fullmetal Alchemist ?
Kekkai Sensen
and so on).
-----One joke. Example-----
Girl explains how ""something"" what had a mold and a sculpture into a slime. Because it went through a small hole so it smushed all together to get thruough. And a pervy guy says. Can you repeat that how it goes through a small hole and so on.
(-_-). He does it multiple times.
And other jokes what the main character makes.
-----Character explanation-----
And I start to notice a thing in anime. Where characters are really similar to eatch other from other animes. I believe they even have names for it. (Obviously I'm not a weeb who knows that stuff. Half joke).
-Pervy guy. Like from other animes. Does pervy stuff.
-Girl who tries to be stoic? Without much emotions? But in deep she has feelings? Gets angry/triggered super fast but tries to not show it..?
-Girl who is unable to live alone and needs other peoples help.
And more I guess.
Anime characters never will be realistic these days? Thanks Attack on Titan new season! They did well.
Sorry. Just mad that a good anime gets ruined by lame jokes AGAIN. (^_^)
And me starting to notice character personality patters.
-----Giving tips/Questioning myself/Little ramble-----
I guess maybe I have gotten too old to appreciate these kinds of ""childish"" jokes or similar characters kind of over and over again. I don't know.
Sorry. Not trying to offend you who likes the jokes or this kind of stuff.
But man.
They should hire comedians to make jokes in animes/movies. Even in non anime stuff.
And stop making similar characters over and over I guess..? People who write anime personalities haven't gone outside and met interesting people? :D (Half joke. For more sensitive people writing these in -->()<--).
Yeah. Probably a really good anime. Deserves the spot what it has. But the jokes though. Yikes.
Characters weren't that bad. I guess.
Me realizing while writing this review that Jujutsu Kaisen and other animes what I have watched had the character thing too. Similar characters from other animes. So it is a thing! (Not 100% sure but 95%).
They should stop the character similarity thing.
-----Ending-----
Sorry for not a good review and half review. I mean I only watched half of the Steins;Gate. (^_^)
Wrote the review for myself in some sense.
So I remember why I stopped watching an anime what I rated 8/10.
Thanks for reading and hopefully the review was useful. But I guess, like most of the people have already seen it. :D",8
"
                A freshly review after I completed the series. First of all I just want to say why the reason I gave it a score of 7 instead of a generelly higher score than it usually gets. I just want to remind some people that this is my review, and Im quite picky  so 7 as score is pretty high and good. 
NON-spoiler review
The Good:
Art: 8/10
The art was high quality made in my sense, and it was very well layered. Even after 8 years later it is still enjoyable. So im sure you will enjoy it even its 10 years later or more. 
Character: 8/10
Quite
                  many characters with many kind of personality. I love it. All of them has something unique about themeselves. And they have their own sotry and background. Watch out for it. Very well layered, and visually characterize the difference in them. For example you see this girl and that girl, you wont mistake them for the same or not remembering them. 
Story: 8/10
A time-travelling anime story is not very usual. Its even more unusual to have one so well layered( I know, I use well layered alot but it sounds nice :). This is a very complete story with no flaw to its time travelling dimension. You cant find a mistake or plot hole in this. Everything makes sense one way or another as the story goes.  
Sound: 7/20
The voice acting was very good, and some of them very cute. The music, some of them were good, but not many of them were memorable for me. But it wasnt bad. 
The bad:
The Pace/enjoyment: 6/10
The pace in this anime was sooooo slow at the beginning. To the point where I dropped it once after watching 4 eps. I knew it was popular so I tried it but it did not reach my expectations so I gave up. I decided this year to give it a chance one more time. I can understand why Steins Gate is a favorite for many or called as masterpiece, I dont disagree. But in my case it was good but not to that point.  The first half was very slow to show the characters or introduce them so we could get to know them. The thing is after watching I felt they did not need to use that many episodes to do so. 
Stein Gate got better and better as the story goes, and I felt all the time I chose not to give up was not in vain. Still is not a favorite to me, but I would recommend to people who likes science fiction, time travelling and mystery.",7
"
                maybe i don't feel the way as everyone feel
wondering what stuff that sitting around on number 2 spot, the score kinda deceived me.. or maybe it's just not my stuff
at least this stuff is still acceptable for those who's not a big fan of timey travel theory but still enjoy SF that have this type of content, however, i can't really feel the heat of the climax
story-wise, it was brilliant, the science & theory aside, but most of it just things that pass go by for the sake of progressing to the final conclusion. only few moments that I truly enjoy.
art-wise, if the color scheme
                  supposed to make the scene to be thrilling and depressing then it's almost there, it's just I don't really feel that, but the idea of turning akiha the heavenly city of the anime culture into a total nightmare kinda spot on. 
sound-wise, all I can remember there are loooots of long long dialog with so minimum bgm and crickets and crickets, summer vibe indeed. however, miyano mamoru, as always, did a brilliant performance.
character-wise, yeah the tsundere might not be as annoying as the other tsundere, at least with no violence, and the other dere(s) at least they're lovely but not have enough punch to leave a great impression. and the MC, besides being crazy and depressed, it's just miyano-san being awesome. i can't feel strong chemistry between the character, even the childhood friends, the romance, or maybe it's because they're just a bunch of weirdos, or it's just supposed to be that way?
p.s: not a fan with designs that uses the same clothes for weeks
overall: maybe those all sound grumpy, but i appreciate it with all my heart that this isn't that bad, brilliant concept, and originality is the charm. it's just from that high score I expect something would be enjoyed by general, or maybe I'm the minorities that cannot truly enjoy this, however, i managed to finish til the end.
if there's some hidden greatness within this series then, changed my mind, but if the answer is ""the sequel will make it great"" then, i'm not buying that, i've had enough",7

                Consider. Can the universe justifiably be called infinite? Doubtful. It may not have a discernible end, but it had a beginning. And its component parts definitely have a limited cosmological shelf-life. Splitting hairs or not, if history tells us anything it‚Äôs that scientists often make very poor poets. We‚Äôre all just a ship of fools chasing phantoms, heedless of what really underwrites natural law. These words are the lines that open an anime that truly can be called a masterpiece‚Äîa show that I would argue is one of the best of our generation. These words are the lines that open Steins;Gate. It‚Äôs an anime based
                  on a visual novel game by 5pb. Inc. and Nitroplus Co., Ltd. The story takes our protagonist, Rintarou Okabe, or Hououin Kyouma as he prefers, through a journey of trials and errors in his quest to reach the titular Steins;Gate, the best possible timeline. How the show brings up interesting ideas in terms of the time-travel concept alongside its generally superb writing with well executed twists and turns around every corner make it a definitely interesting and worthwhile watch.
Steins;Gate‚Äôs anime was done by studio White Fox, who beforehand made the anime Tears to Tiara and Katanagatari, but would go on to make more anime such as The Devil is a Part-Timer and Re:ZERO after this. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt say much is special about the animation itself, but visually, the best parts of this anime come from it‚Äôs spectacular direction and cinematography. As for its audio elements, the soundtracks are done very well, some songs like ‚ÄúGate of steiner -piano-‚Äù and ‚ÄúObserver‚Äù sticking out to me at this moment. They play the right OSTs at just the right times and play them so often that you would remember them clearly, but so scarcely that you wouldn‚Äôt be numb to hearing them over and over again. The OP ‚ÄúHacking to the Gate‚Äù by Kanako Itou and the ED ‚ÄúToki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku‚Äù by Yui Sakakibara are great songs, with the OP having good visuals as well and the ED having that oh-so memorable piano and the scene in episode nine. All the voice actors in the show do a great job at portraying each of their characters, but one thing I do have to add is that this show‚Äôs English dub is just as good, if not even slightly better than its Japanese dub. Of course, it‚Äôs always an option to watch both.
Rintarou ‚ÄùOkarin‚Äù Okabe, or Hououin Kyouma as he likes to call himself, is a self-proclaimed ‚Äúmad scientist,‚Äù and Lab Member 001 of The Future Gadget Lab. His lab is in reality just an apartment above a CRT shop, and it‚Äôs where he and his other two lab members reside, those being Mayuri ‚ÄúMayushii‚Äù Shiina, a cosplayer and Lab Member 002; and Itaru ‚ÄúDaru‚Äù Hashida, a super hacker and Lab Member 003. One day, Okarin finds a young scientist by the name of Makise Kurisu dead in a pool of blood, and texts Daru that Kurisu has been found dead. Though, he finds that once he sends the text, everything has changed, and later on, finds that Kurisu is alive. Aside from that, The Future Gadget Lab has developed something known as the PhoneWave, which is a microwave that is able to send things through time. The group eventually discover that they can send messages to the past to change their worldline in what they call D-Mails. Slowly, they change their worldline with D-Mails, but every time they change something they think is for the better, things start to get more and more sinister, with Okarin being the only one aware that their worldline is changing due to his Reading Steiner ability.
This first half is slow-paced and dedicated to introducing out concepts and plotlines, but it‚Äôs never too slow to the point of being boring, since each episode is interesting in their own right. I believe it only gets better as you go on, but you can notice little details and foreshadowing that may seem not that important at first, but will grow to appreciate the specific details later on when you fully understand the context. Seemingly small things like Ruka and Future Gadget Number 4, Okarin calling Mr. Tennouji ‚ÄúMr. Braun,‚Äù and Suzuha being interested in the corn are made to be so important later on in the show. The show slowly builds up its cool cast of characters for these first twelve-or-so episodes before reaching a boiling point where things really start to get going. The unique cast is presented at first by their slice of life moments in the show, and they‚Äôre expounded on further as the series goes on.
This show‚Äôs strongest card in terms of its characters is the protagonist, Hououin Kyouma himself, Rintarou Okabe. Since he‚Äôs the only one with the Reading Steiner ability that‚Äôs able to see the big changes in worldlines, he gets the most development. His Hououin Kyouma personality is endearing and fun to see, a chuunibyou-type delusional persona of a mad scientist who talks about ‚ÄúThe Organization‚Äù and uses a lot of foreign words and generally speaks strangely. But over time, we start to see his facade slip and learn more about Rintarou Okabe himself more‚Äîsee his more vulnerable and caring side. His character feels just so human and real. We can see his strengths in his perseverance, his flaws in his rashness, his pain from having to go through so much so many times, and his deep care for his loved ones. His childhood friend Mayuri is important as well, though. She plays such a big part in the story of Steins;Gate, especially in the latter half, but her personality is strong enough that she‚Äôs a character first, plot device second. The other original member, super hacker Daru, is the tech guy of the team; he‚Äôs always there to help with the mechanical and technical related things like building and repairing gadgets and hacking into things. Then comes Makise Kurisu, Lab Member 004, who Okarin gives many nicknames such as The Zombie, Celeb-17, Assistant, American Virgin, Perverted Genius Girl, and Christina. She‚Äôs a calm, level-headed girl who helps with the development of the time-related gadgets in the lab, and later builds the Time-Leap Machine.
There are many other characters in Steins;Gate who are mainly just side-characters, but play an important role nonetheless. There‚Äôs the stoic and mysterious Kiryuu ‚ÄúShining Finger‚Äù Moeka, who mainly communicates by texting; the RaiNet Access Battlers champion, maid-cafe worker, and fellow chuunibyou Rumiho Akiha, who‚Äôs also known as Faris Nyannyan; the one that‚Äôs delicate as an orchid, fair as a cherry blossom, the personification of feminine grace, and a dude by the name of Ruka Urushibara, or Rukako as he‚Äôs sometimes called; the energetic and strange Suzuha Amane, who works at the CRT shop downstairs; then Yuugo Tennouji, or Mr. Braun as Okarin likes to call him, the stern owner of the CRT shop; and Nae Tennouji, Mr. Braun‚Äôs daughter who everyone loves. All the characters in Steins;Gate are well-rounded and interesting, and they all have some kind of importance to the plot in one way or another. While most of them just mainly stick to one personality trait, they‚Äôre still nice to see on the screen. Obviously, with Okarin being the only one who can really time-travel and remember everything, he gets the most development, but all the characters have their big moments as well.
Steins;Gate shows us the importance of sacrifice and moving forward to reach an end goal. Each D-Mail one of the lab members sends creates ripples through time that affect the worldline deeply in some way. The thing is, each D-Mail they send fulfills the wishes of one of the characters, so undoing the D-Mails means helping reach the greater good, but losing their happiness. Because of D-Mails, you can prevent someone from dying, but have large scale effects on an entire city. Sending any of the D-Mails in the first place is seen as a mistake, and while it kind of was, it‚Äôs painful to see the wishes of the characters we like seen that way, no? Some chose to place the value of their own life on someone unreliable, some chose to go through with faulty plans at the cost of failing their mission as a whole, and some just keep trying to save someone over and over and expecting it to be different just this once.
Was creating time-travel a mistake in it of itself? Okarin tries to fix these mistakes he keeps making with the Time-Leap Machine, but the memories of them stay with him forever in his memories. One could see Reading Steiner as a blessing, another as a curse. The mistakes and their effects can never truly be changed. Okarin has to learn to live with that, but at the same time he still has to try and make things right. Mayuri tells Okarin that if she had memories of a conversation they had in one timeline, but never had in the other, she would cry. Not for Okarin, but for herself. The mental toll that time-travelling over and over again has on this one person is immense. At one point, he himself feels like he‚Äôs stopped being shocked by what he has to go through in each iteration and worldline. His heart becomes numb to the events taking place, and thought sometimes that he can just redo whatever happens. Someone like Okarin, who created the Future Gadget Lab to make friends and created the Hououin Kyouma persona as a mask to hide his vulnerability and be there for his friends, was given the Reading Steiner ability. Of all people, don‚Äôt you think he‚Äôs not really the best suited for this? That‚Äôs what makes his journey so heavy and compelling.
Okarin is a source of endless determination. He‚Äôll keep going on and try to reach Steins;Gate no matter what it takes. Sure, he‚Äôll give up sometimes; the mere existence of Steins;Gate 0 is proof of that. But in the end, he always has to rise again and keep pursuing Steins;Gate‚Äîthe best possible timeline there is. He cares for people like Kurisu and Mayuri deeply, and keeping them safe is his primary goal. With that care, he has to reach out for help and help others to reach a worldline where he finally saves himself from the pain. Every person is important. Every person has their own story to tell. Each of the characters has a story of their own that no one would have ever known if it weren't for their interactions. Someone having a secret crush on someone they feel they can‚Äôt love, someone feeling empty after the loss of a loved one, someone being so lonely to the point of suicide, someone having an abusive parent yet still wanting their approval, someone living a double life to keep the one they care for safe‚Äîall people who seem unassuming and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù at first glance. The individual stories kept within the characters of the show all play a larger part in the story, but it may also reflect on the people in the real world.
Seeing the time-loops happen over and over again and how Okarin has to try over and over again, but still struggles with getting anywhere meaningful is just as impactful each time. His struggle seems endless, and may even land him in a spot of despair, but he‚Äôs reminded time and time again of the goal he needs to reach, and gets back up to try it once more. It‚Äôs a story that shows the meaningful connections between people, the importance that people have to one another and the world, the effects of trying to change the past, the important pain of sacrifice, and the need to keep on going to reach the best possible outcome you can. We can‚Äôt deny that we can never truly change the past, but we still keep trying to change the present.
This anime truly is amazing; it does what it tries to do super well. Steins;Gate as a show is rife with good themes, characters, direction, voice acting, and overall good writing. The light parts have dark bits sprinkled in to keep you on your toes, and the darker parts have bits of light in them to not feel too depressing or overbearing. The first half is slow yet not boring, and the second half is engaging and thrilling. This show can go from a science thriller, to a comedy slice of life show, to a dark time-loop, to an emotional rollercoaster and it works. It‚Äôs an entertaining show through and through with cards up its sleeve you knew were there all along but will still be surprised you never thought of how they would use them before. I love the timey-wimey stuff in my anime, and this show is pretty much the prime example of one that I might just love the most. Overall, Steins;Gate is far from a disappointment for me, and it doesn‚Äôt become one no matter how much I watch it. I highly recommend it to basically anyone. El Psy Congroo.",9

                let me start of by saying i watched the season in 2 years when i first started i hated the slow pace so quit but after a while seeing the reviews i decided to re watch or i mean to saw re start from where i left i left the anime at ep 12 and then 2 years later i binged the rest in 1 day (in quarantine 2020). 
*minor spoilers*
i decided to write a review for this anime after seeing all the low rating reviews (i usually dont write reviews) i thought  to put my view up since i also first gave it
                  a 6 for its slow pace i totally get it why you wouldnt like it for reasons like the pacing of the anime, the art , not living up to the hype and mainly these two the unscientific explanations of time and the way he just fucks up the timeline and then goes back to fix it and keeps failing but then succeeds.
know i want to tell you why they didnt or why they did matter to me 
1)the pace: the pacing still bothers me i think if it were good in the starting i would have watched it without a hiatus but none the less i enjoyed the later half of the shows pace it was pretty good.
2)not living up to the hype: i never read reviews or the ratings until recently so i had no expectations whatsoever so i just watched it with an unbiased view and ended up liking the show but to say about the hype i think people tend to over hype things they like and just give people hope that its a perfect show with no flaws which is impossible even for a 10 star rated anime because it all boils down to preferences so i think you should just watch it with an unbiased opinion and not rub the fact of it was reviewed high but it was not to my liking and then the reviews dont matter.
3)(the main reasons people didnt like and the deciding factor of why you would or wouldnt like it) the science of time : ah ! time in pop culture is perceived in a thousand ways and how changing time would effect the future many things in pop culture about time cant be explained so i think its better leaving its explanation then slapping the word quantum for every thing undefined in this case the explanations are considered by many child like for its simple explantion as i said time travelling isnt real so any and all explanations are just theories so as long as the concept given in the series isnt bonkers i dont mind any theory and many people said that its just magic with the name of science in away that's what time travel for us is as of know so i dont mind things like the fact of fate changing things back . (this all my personal theory after reading this you can understand what the state of science is used in the series )",10

                I watched Steins;Gate because I've been told it's a beloved anime and considered a masterpiece by many. While I'm not sure I 100% agree with the ""masterpiece"" designation, Steins;Gate is very, very good and worth your time. I give it close to an 8 out of 10 overall, and I'll explain why:
The set-up is simple: we have a make-shift lab and a bunch of broke high-school/college-age misfits who are into science, cosplay, hacking, and maid cafes (to varying degrees). We're in the year 2010, which is charming to look back to, because this is right before the boom of smartphones, so there's something nostalgic about
                  seeing the Razr-style flip phones. The setting, a neighborhood in Tokyo known for its caterings to Otaku culture, becomes folded into the story and the characters as well. Much of the story takes place in a lab, lead by the so-called mad scientist Hououin Kyoma AKA Okabe Rintaro AKA Okarin. As time goes on, the lab begins to gain more members (loosely, at times) and a coterie of sorts is formed. Most of the characters are kept with a bit of a distance at the beginning. On one level, this makes for a mystery to their pasts and futures, which in a show that deals with memory and time travel, leaves you with a lot of paranoia and second-guessing about the nature of the cast. The downside to this is the characters sometimes feel unknowable and distant at the beginning, or downright unlikable, and I found myself powering through solely based on being told that this is a must-watch series, and I had faith that a pay-off/turning point would happen soon.
Steins;Gate is all about pacing and structure. Without revealing too much, the narrative format of the show almost reaches a palindrome or a labyrinth, where you're working your way to the middle of the labyrinth, and then reversing your steps because the entrance is also the exit. From the very first episode, you see some telegraphing that this is going to be a show about the distortion of time/space and butterfly effects. There are characters who have met, or haven't met. There are events that have happened, or haven't happened. Thirty minutes into the series, you will have a sense of skepticism about what you're supposed to believe, or not.
I know there are some fans who get defensive at the ""slow"" allegations, but I did find many elements to be slightly hindering in my early watch. It's not just the characters that affect the pacing at the beginning though. The pacing is made slow by a gradual plot too, and doesn't begin to pick up until you're a third of the way through the show (around 7 or 8 episodes in). This not to say there is not tension though. The slow structure feels purposeful with slight changes and upping the ante with each passing episode. Each time the credits roll, you get the sense that more powder is being crammed into a keg.
Without going too deep into specifics, when the show has introduced the full cast of characters, and the characters start to send D-mails, it filled me with a dread, 1) because these D-mails weren't entirely vetted by the lab and 2) Because the viewer doesn't initially ""see"" the contents, so there's an uncanny feeling just about how much the world is being shaped by the past being altered. Okarin gives a lot of allowance to the people around him. He is accused of not seeing the bigger picture at the beginning, and that shows early on. You, the viewer, grasp the sense that the teenage characters (often smarter than their years, but certainly not wiser) are messing with stakes that go way higher than cosplaying as some mad scientists. Playing with the time/space continuum, even in tiny dosages, is nothing to shake a stick at. Or shake an hourglass. Halfway through the series, during episode 12, the powder keg has reached maximum capacity, and gets ignited in an explosion.
Something that the structure of the plot does is after it reaches a sort of climax, it moves backwards in a way, and even when we get some serious, emotional moments, the second half of the series has so many wonderful moments of humor between the cast of characters. Episode 12 and onward is where the show really shines. The latter half of the series is when the characters seem less two-dimensional and become better fleshed out. The final twelve episodes are also where all the set-up from the first half is resolved, and it's a non-stop pay-off watching everything unfold. The only thing I'll say is sometimes the melodrama of the latter half didn't hit me. I felt more emotionally impacted by certain moments like the mystery of John Titor's father than... certain moments where characters were weeping and screaming. Speaking of characters, perhaps this is a good place to wind down the review.
I was not overly fond of Okarin at the beginning, to be honest. Although he has shown to be compassionate and comedic (even him being broke is a source of humor), his obliviousness, indiscretion, secretiveness, bullishness, and occasional sexism could be frustrating. What's even more frustrating is his failure to communicate to other characters and keeping them in the dark. This is remedied as he learned to trust some of his lab mates more, communicate, and become a heroic, lovable oaf. It also makes his character arc much more rewarding, as you see this goofball have to suffer to fix some of the problems he either directly caused or allowed to happen. Okarin is truly a complex character with a good heart, and it was a pleasure following his story to the end. And all the other characters too: by the end you get a better sense of each of them.
Beyond story and character, the art is decent: not mind-blowing, but appropriate for the story being told. Likewise, I don't think I paid much attention to the music besides a few key moments where it called attention to itself. It was fine: didn't detract, and was mostly there to complement the emotional arcs of the story and characters.
Overall, Steins;Gate is an important watch, especially if you enjoy shows that feel like long movies with each episode feeding into the next one. Especially if you like sci-fi shows that dabble in the 'time travel' genre. It's incredibly well-structured, the characters are great, and the journey has many pay-offs. Perhaps you won't find the first half as slow as I did, but I promise there are rewards for those who stick with it.",8

                After rewatching this series 5+ times I can still proudly say it's one of the very few anime series I can rewatch without getting bored. 
The story is filled will strong griping emotions with twists down every path. The elements mentions throughout the story can actually be found irl with some tweaking to aid the script of course. A Time Travel story is always going to have major plot holes, however, to my surprise this series does a good job avoiding, covering, and fixing a lot of them.
Art is pretty typical for this era of anime, I don't recall seeing any bad CG or poorly
                  drawn things that draw your attention away from the main focus.
Sound and music was enjoyable with the OP being one of my favorite songs to listen to. The excessive use of Mayuri's ""Doo Ta Rooo"" could be seen as cute, I'm starting to find it a little annoying though.
Characters were pretty good, They left lots of mystery in the beginning but answer a lot of questions that tie things in with the story nicely towards the end.
Over all, I highly recommend it to all of you si-fi lovers and people looking for a good drama. Everytime I rewatch it I pick up something new and never fails to keep my attention. For those thirsty for more Steins;Gate story, there is a lot of content from spin-offs, movies, and more! 
One last thing I will say is if you want the full experience, watch it subbed first. No I'm not one of those ""Subbed is best"" people but I will say the amount of English put into it makes it hella funny. Most of those funny parts are sadly lost in the dubbed. So take my word for it, first round watch it subbed then watch it anyway y'all like XD.",9

                Ah yes, Steins;Gate; an immensely popular sci-fi show, currently appearing as MAL's 4th highest-ranking anime. Because of its recent skyrocket in popularity, I decided to hop on the hype train. So, what is it about Steins;Gate that labels it ""[one of] the greatest animes of all time""? This question was one of the major factors that influenced me to watch Steins;Gate, along with its massive accumulation of 10-star reviews on MAL. Buckle up, as I'm going to say a few controversial things about this show. 
Story: 6 
As a sci-fi anime, Stein;Gate seems pretty generic. As much as I'm not a huge sci-fi fan (I've
                  only watched Angel Beats up until now), I was excited for what was in store for me. As time travel is a basic topic, I could only give the story a slightly above-average rating. I found some parts of the plot to be boring, confusing, and downright frustrating, further contributing to its lower rating. 
Let's start with the first 3 or so episodes. I know that everyone labels these as ""boring"" and ""confusing"" (which by all means, they were), however, I found myself oddly entertained. Something fascinated me about the story, even though it didn't make any sense. Around episode 11 or 12 is when I was most entertained, and around episode 17 I found myself bored. I'm unsure as to why, maybe I was just lazy, but I didn't find the story NEARLY as entertaining as before. The closest conclusion I made was due to the show's repetition during this arc. Although it was necessary for the plot, I was insanely uninterested. 
One of my favorite parts about the anime wasn't necessarily the anime itself; it was trying to figure out puzzles and listening to others' predictions and figuring out if they were correct. That said, I hate how confusing this anime was at times. I had to watch certain scenes a few times over just to comprehend the concept of world lines, alpha and beta world lines, and the 1% barrier. I wish the explanations of such phenomena were clearer and more detailed. If they were, I would be able to enjoy the show more instead of having to go back and rewatch scenes just to comprehend the story.
Now, let's talk briefly about the ending. (Note that I'm writing this review before watching Steins;Gate 0; this won't affect my review, I'd just like to mention it.) Long story short (as I'm sure you wouldn‚Äôt want to read another thousand or so characters about the story alone), I loved the ending. The ending elucidated the entirety of the beginning (which I was definitely thankful for), and it flowed naturally. All in all, I found the ending to be far more satisfying than other Steins;Gate episodes. 
Art: 5
To be honest, the art and animation were utterly terrible at times. Let‚Äôs use the (SPOILER ALERT) death scenes as an example. You‚Äôd expect the studio to ATLEAST put SOME effort into making the death scenes realistic, as they were insanely important to the plot (maybe adding a bit of blood, etc.) However, no. Some of the death scenes were dreadful to watch. First of all, the corpse, even if being stabbed or injured with a fatal wound, was never animated with any blood, despite Steins;Gate being a thriller about time travel, involving lots of violence, anguish, and despair. Other than that, there weren‚Äôt too many problems with the art. Considering that Steins;Gate was made in 2011, the art was basic, but I don't hold that against the show.
Sound: 8
The OP and ED of Steins;Gate were very good in my opinion! The voice acting was done well; my only wish would have been for more intense BM at times, such as death scenes. It seemed BM was poorly used during some scenes. Other than that, the sound was good!
Character: 9
By far, my favorite aspect of this show was the characters. 
Rintarou Okabe-
Okabe was my favorite character of Steins;Gate. He made me laugh countless times. I loved his immature behavior at the beginning of the show. He underwent immense character development throughout the anime, resulting in him becoming more serious and compassionate by the end of the show. 
Kurisu Makise-
Kurisu was my second favorite character of Steins;Gate. She was very intelligent and a huge tsundere. Despite that, though, she still cared a lot for her friends.
This anime was full of individual characters with strong personalities; my only complaint would be the shallowness of Mayuri‚Äôs character. As she was so important to Okabe, I would‚Äôve liked to see more from her character, other than her ‚Äúsilly‚Äù, ‚Äúchild-like‚Äù personality. 
Enjoyment: 8
Steins;Gate was fun to watch, however, as I‚Äôve already mentioned, It was confusing as hell sometimes. The characters' interactions with each other were very entertaining for me, as it usually resulted in some hilarious roast battles between Okabe and Makise. 
Overall: 7
Maybe it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt like sci-fi too much, but based on my interpretation, Steins;Gate doesn't really deserve the title ""[one of the] greatest anime of all time."" Don't get me wrong; it was good, however, In my opinion, it was highly overrated. There were many pros and cons to this anime. The story was basic and hard to follow at times, but the ending was good. The art was mediocre, and the death scenes were embarrassing. The music was great, but BM was used poorly. The characters were loveable, and the show was hilarious. 
Would I recommend Steins;Gate? Yes, I would. Although it may have not been the perfect anime for me, it was still fun to watch.",7
"
                SPOILERS, of course.
Steins;Gate is in many respects still a work in progress, the currently airing show, 0, essentially wrings out the character development in our protagonist Okarin that made the ending to this show possible. If anything, the original show cheats a little by showing us that development ahead of time so we can get our happy ending ahead of time. 
Further, as objectionable as some might think it, the movie also adds to and furnishes out an account of what Steins; Gate is doing, what it's saying -- about people, about the human condition, about free will and choice.
And of course, what the show
                  is doing, what its saying, what its point and purpose is, what it shows and tells in truths about human beings is what I am concerned with. I'm not concerned with whether or not a particular part here (and here I'll be looking at the original show, 0 and the Deja Vu movie) is or isn't canon, nor if it somehow 'breaks the established rules of the show' yadda yadda etc.
This is a show about time travel, the innumerable paradoxes and logistical problems that would abound were time travel feasible render the concept itself absurd scientifically. Whether or not Steins; Gate follows its own rules only matters to the extent that following those rules makes the audience find the world believable, and to the extent that Steins; Gate breaks them or adds to them -- especially Deja Vu -- only matters if they are so glaringly, insanely disillusioning that they pull you out of the entire experience. One might be right in arguing that Deja Vu adds new rules, modifies old ones, and isn't always quite clear on its own internal logic with its viewers. That's okay though! In the end, like I said, none of this *really* makes sense.
It doesn't have to, that isn't a criticism of Steins;Gate. The show isn't relying on the internal logic of its own time travel rules being consistent in order that you, the viewer, might remain invested. That's ridiculous. The show is simply using, as all good sci-fi does, its fictional concepts and ideas as a platform to tell a story. If rule-breaking and minor inconsistency can enhance that storytelling, or can do more for that storytelling than adhering to them could, then go ahead and break them!
So, I'll be arguing that each of the three parts here that constitute the whole of Steins;Gate are necessary for it to form a coherent whole, in order for it to say what it wants to say. Deja Vu included. As such, this is basically a review for all three (Obviously not 0 yet). While most will admit that neither the movie nor Steins;Gate 0 could stand on their own without the original show, I'd like to argue that the original show would be grossly incomplete without 0 and the movie as well.
In order to understand why this is, we need to understand what Steins;Gate is saying, we must understand the philosophy at work in it.
We'll also need to understand what each part of the whole is doing, that is, what Steins Gate, 0 and Deja Vu are each doing respectively, what their goals are.
So, let's get started!
A young man, discouraged and distressed, sits on a bench in the rain. His friend, Mayuri, has been depressed since the passing of her grandmother. He feels unable to aid her in the way she needs it. A woman sits beside him and tells him the story of the great mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma. She tells him of how he is always regaling his friends with tales of the evil organization, of secret plots and sinister threats lurking in the shadows, and how his friends all found him very amusing for this outlandish persona. She tells him of how Hououin Kyouma, unbeknownst to his friends, did in fact really save them from the most nightmarish of realities, but did so alone, for they could never know -- and they laughed at his persona for it, and so he carried on alone.
'That's a sad story' says Okabe Rintarou
Within the tragically comic tale, though, Okabe found the resources to take on that persona to save Mayuri, to pretend to be the mad scientist he heard of, if only to distract his friend from her woes for a moment. Okabe found himself talking of the organization, of the world order that must be destroyed, of secrecy, of time travel. In adopting this persona, and playfully demanding that Mayuri must remain his hostage, perhaps for the sake of his 'plans' and 'plots' to destroy the 'world order', he found a way to be there for his friend.
Regardless, in time, Okabe came to rely on that persona more and more -- as a shield for himself and for fun. In time, the story of that mad scientist became the story of Okabe Rintarou, as he endeavored and succeeded in creating an actual time machine, in hacking into the database of a powerful organization, in changing the past and the future, in saving and failing to save his friends from the kind of sinister forces he loved to talk outlandishly of, but never dreamed of really encountering.
Just like the mad scientist he heard about from the woman, he came to save his friends from very real danger, but did so essentially alone. In his moving from timeline to timeline, the memories of his friends faded and reset, so while he could lean on them for a time, while they would empathize with him in that moment, soon those moments would be gone -- no longer even in their past memories.
Determined and unwavering, Okabe eventually succeeding in rewriting history, triumphing over the organization, and saving his friends. He had brought them to a world line where the world was stable, peace reigned, the organization had no plans and there was no time travel.
It is worth mentioning at this point that he HASN'T really done this yet. As I mentioned, the show deigns to tell and show us the happy ending achieved after Okabe goes through the suffering and character growth necessary to get there -- but without showing us the suffering and character growth. That's ongoing, that's what Steins;Gate 0 is. In some sense, I know it never would've happened, but it would be quite the long-game payoff if Steins;Gate actually ended with episode 23b to lead into 0 instead of giving us 23, 24 and 25, which we would've only got after 0.
I don't know exactly how 0 will show Okabe develop, change and grow -- but he will. Knowing the quality of all past work, and White Fox's ability, I posit it will be masterful. I like the direction it has gone in so far. Whether for better or worse, I'll update this review when the time comes accordingly.
However, assuming for the purpose of my overview that Okabe reaches the point he does in 0 and successfully changes the past that would've happened in 23b to the past we see in 23, 24 and 25, we can take a look at where Steins;Gate has gone, what it's shown, and what it's said.
In many regards, the show is simply using the fantasy of time travel to showcase the importance of choice, of the weight of our actions, of accepting responsibility and doing what you can to change things. Where a story that was told linearly, where time moved linearly, would show our characters develop naturally, where their ability to rise to the occasion and act virtuously or not would depend on their development, on their virtue or vice up to that moment, that isn't how things work here.
In our 23rd episode, instead, what basically happens is Okabe gets a video message from the version of himself that has undergone that development and character growth, one that tells him the things he needs to know, one that shows him how to be the person he needs to be at this moment. He becomes that person, undergoing the development his future self did for him, except right now.
We don't have that luxury, of course. No one ever has or ever will. Steins;Gate knows that, too.
When he makes himself and his friends able to live in a world where there isn't any time travel, where World War III doesn't happen, where they're not executed by SERN, then they are finally free to embrace the infinite potential of the future.
In some sense, they're finally able to step into the reality we know and understand. In many regards, all the ways Steins;Gate plays around with the choices of the characters to change the past, to step onto different world lines and seek different realities speaks to the power of human choice, to the pursuit of the good. Except, in the fantasy that plays out, that takes the form of reversing established reality and putting something else in its place, of changing past events and pasting over them with new one, of leaving behind traces and fragments of those previously existing realities in people's heads.
Obviously, again, that isn't the world we inhabit, but it is in some sense a great portrait of the solemn reality of our choices, of the way that we think through, imagine and fantasize about other ways things *could be*, of he way we think about ways thing *could have been* different.
Time leaping and sending d-mails are very much directly parallel to actually making freely-willed choices to affect circumstances in our reality. In many ways, it seems as though the realities on most of Okabe's traveled world lines are fatalistic situations -- this person must die and in another, this other person. No matter what Okabe does within those individual world lines -- those fates do not change.
His pursuit, eventually, is to cross a barrier that will open new possibilities, so to speak. He seeks to cross over '1% divergence'. All the jargon that goes along with this, about 'divergence' from the alpha, beta world lines, about the 'field attractors' that bind the other world lines to fixed point. In terms of plain, straightforward explanation, or scientific understanding, they're worthless -- it's basically just jargon that means 'Present situation bad, fate unavoidable, do magic plot thingy to make it so fate isn't set in stone' -- and that's okay. 
On the level of thematic coherency, again, running toward a reality where your choices matter, where everyone's choices matter, where we aren't fated to do xyz, where we have a say in what becomes of us, that's a really great message -- I don't care how the show chooses to dress it up. For it's purposes, it's a sci-fi show, so inventing some sci-fi jargon that translates it into the language of our protagonist is exactly what it needs to do.
I love, too, the way that getting to a reality where fate can be escaped involves undoing the d-mails that changed the past, involves making right the meddling with established reality. That's a nice little hint at the meaning of the main run of the show here, even our main characters can't *really* meddle with past events and change them to their liking -- they have to reckon with the reality given to them by the choices of others -- there's no avoiding the weight of our own moral agency, nor that of others.
It does it well, and Steins;Gate is a beautiful work for it, I can't wait to see how 0 enriches and adds to it.
But but but!
I told the story of the show from the beginning according to two perspectives, one from what is presumably the show's original timeline, where he hears about Hououin Kyouma from something else, and another from Deja Vu's.
I left a few threads in there dangling for Deja Vu to pick up.
Okabe made his choices and became the mad scientist that he read about, he led his friends toward a world where they were free. In so living that life, though, he took on the tragic loneliness and detachment that the woman so described to him in another timeline. He had taken it all on himself, his friends unable to remember those past realities, while he did. He saw it all, remembered it all. While his friends could freely move forward, he found himself strangely stuck, pulled in all directions by those worlds he had left behind.
That's how the movie tells it anyway. Just like the show, though, the jargon here is just jargon, and it doesn't matter here any more than it did there exactly how much straight logical sense that jargon makes. It matters EVEN LESS whether this new jargon syncs up with the old jargon -- and that is essentially the debate people are engaged in when they whine about Deja Vu's new jargon breaking the rules of the old jargon. It is a futile, fruitless and pointless discussion. None of it is pertinent or useful for understanding.
What does matter? What matters is what thematically the jargon serves to communicate, just like before.
What's being communicated here, then? Basically, that in living his self-sacrificing, lonely and disconnected life as Hououin Kyouma, Okabe Rintarou has become lonely and disconnected -- unable to move forward, stuck feeling as though he must disappear to hold the world up and let his friends move forward.
It is, as all things in a sense are, a question of the heart. Who will heal Okabe's wounds and bring him back to reality?
Well, that's Makise Kurisu of course.
There are a fair few missed opportunities in the original show for Makise Kurisu to shine on her own, to step into the role of the protagonist as fully and as thoroughly as Okabe does. Presumably that's because the show is faithfully adapting its source material. Which, while still great, is a VN, and VN's do tend to be self-serving to their protagonists and give them the dumb harems they desire. Some of Steins;Gate's more harem-y episodes do get on my nerves, as does the strange sex ratio of the show. These factors, like Rem in Re:Zero, generally only get in the way of the show's primary objective. 
There's really no good reason why the source material couldn't have just had more male characters who had their own problems and arcs to go through, or had the existing female characters with their problems but no interest in romantic entanglements with Okabe. We know why it's written this way though, to please and attract a male demographic that wants that sort of fantasy. I can't entirely blame White Fox for adapting the source material as it was, I imagine market forces moved them to faithfully adapt it.
Regardless, criticisms that center around the fact that Makise Kurisu could've done more, could've shouldered the burden that Okabe carries with him -- or acted on her own, are fair. They're right. It could have and should have been written that way. It would've been super cool to see Kurisu time-leaping along with Okabe, or to have Okabe suddenly discover that she had leapt back in time, much to his surprise. It would've been great for her to be the full partner to Okabe that the show portrays her as being romantically. It would've been great for her impact on the progression of the plot, on the events of the show to be at least equal to Okabe's. There're a lot of, as I said, missed opportunities there, given what a rich and brilliant character she is.
Well, I guess someone heard those criticisms, or saw the opportunity for Makise Kurisu to play the protagonist as she should've before.
Beyond the missed opportunities and wasted potential, the other problem with other characters being unable to play parts in Okabe's struggle, with Okabe taking on the role of the stoic, lonely crusader, is that the stoic is wrong! He isn't alone and others should, can and do play a part in his -- in their -- story.
A thematic movement present in one of White Fox's other works is what's needed, and is what Deja Vu will deliver. In Re:Zero, part of the point of Subaru's character portrayal is that not only is he not alone, but he cannot be successful without others. He's just not all that great. The sentiment isn't only a comment about the quality of Subaru's character, though in part it is. It also just applies to everyone -- noone is invincible, able to do everything, able to take on everything -- we all need others, we all need eachother. Life, in all of its adventures and misadventures, is a communal story, is a story of how we rise or fall together -- it is not a story of individuals navigating those seas alone. The individual is a great modern myth.
The same applies to Okabe -- he can't do this alone, he shouldn't try. He does try though, he tries and tries to hold up that world so that his friends might go on. He became the stoic image of Hououin Kyouma, not recognizing himself, his own desires, his own value, his own heart. So, he disappeared, he vanished. Just as the stoic would, just as the stoic does. Before he vanishes once and for all, he tells Kurisu not to meddle with time, not to change things, not to become like him. He tries to deny her, to deny his friends even memory of him. He tells her to forget him.
The jargon the movie uses for this, is that Okabe has been pulled to the 'R' worldline which is 0.0000001% different from the Steins;Gate worldline or something, and we're shown imagery of the two worldlines flowing in unision around one another -- as if they are tied together. This is not, as I said, a mechanic in the original show or 0 as far as I understand, it's new. Again, though, does not matter, it's just sci-fi jargon used for the purpose of communicating thematic content and ideas, secondarily its purpose is to integrate the event of Okabe's disappearance with the story of the rest of the worldlines, as the imagery is familiar.
If one wants to argue that Deja Vu's presentation, thrills, and explanation of how each plot point proceeds isn't up to par with the original show, that's fair. The original show sets a very high bar, and this is a format very different from that of the show. However, the thematic content, meaning and final ending to Steins;Gate that Deja Vu leaves us with is perfect and altogether needed for the entire work to be complete.
The rest of what proceeds is in many respects a mirror retelling of the final arc and ending of the show, with Kurisu experiencing much of the same trial. At first, she tries to accept Okabe's wish, and forget him. She discovers that this is impossible though, not only because she remembers him more than the others do, but the others distinctly know and feel the hole he has left behind -- they all feel something missing in his absence.
She at once grabs her screwdriver and orders Daru to hack into SERN, and proceeds to begin making the time leap machine again, knowing full well that it will be fruitless -- Okabe will disappear again, and again. Mayuri steps in to tell her to stop, as this will hurt her, and Kurisu remembers what Okabe said of her wisdom and maturity, assenting to her plea.
That's a really beautiful illustration of the crux of the conflict here in Deja Vu. We need others. Without him, they felt the strangeness of his being gone. Without them, he feels pulled apart, torn from the world he is meant to be a part of. He thinks himself alone. He can't really disappear in order that he maintain the goods he gained for his friends, for his disappearing is a loss that they cannot recover from, a hole that can never be filled. His stoicism is a false solution, an unworkable one. For himself, for them.
'Your mightily annoying self won't disappear from anyone's heart. Even when you think you've been forgotten, our memories of you will always remain somewhere.'
Suzuha has again come from the future before she has been born to Daru and her mother, this time because Kurisu invented the time machine in Okabe's absence, but sealed it away because it is 'the will of Okabe Rintarou'. A nice little mirror of Okabe's constant reference to the will of Steins;Gate, which, in truth, is only a reference to Okabe's own will, to the power of his own will to make choices and change reality.
Suzuha returns to try and convince Kurisu to change Okabe's past, to tie him to reality -- and the Steins;Gate worldline is basically as real as it gets in this story. She thought that perhaps the past Kurisu would be more willing to be true to herself, to her own will, to the will of Steins;Gate!
And, if we might, we should just pause and remember that Suzuha is the fucking best. She is the catalyst for so many characters growing and doing what is needed throughout the show and movie.
Kurisu makes one attempt, and, like Okabe's first attempt to save Kurisu, it fails and ends in Okabe's death. She returns, shaken from the experience. 'Okabe felt this feeling of powerlessness, all by himself, all this time' She feels as though any further attempts will be equally fruitless and painful.
This is actually a really great move though. Seeing the parallel to Okabe's initial failure is easy. However, what's even more remarkably beautiful about this is that her initial failure, like Okabe's so that his video from the 0 timeline might unlock, was necessary.
In this case, it is necessary that she feel that same powerlessness because she must feel what Okabe feels, she must walk with him in order to reach him, in order that he might feel her presence and realize that he is not alone in this. She must walk his path.
She tries to forget again, and is again confronted with all the characters feeling Okarin's absence. Kurisu, in her mental self-monologue, pleading with them not to remember.
'Listen Kurisu, do you know about 'Okarin'? You see, when I'm here, sometimes that word just pops into my head'
She gives in, taking on his jacket and persona, proclaiming herself the mad scientist Hououin Kyouma before them all. They all find themselves responding as they would to Okabe, shocked at their own reactions to nonexistent memories.
Mayuri's line is the most poignant of them: 'But Kurisu, you're not Hououin Kyouma, Hououin Kyouma is...' To which, Kurisu affirmatively responds 'Hououin Kyouma is Okabe Rintarou' The name reaching their ears like a long-forgotten truth, suddenly remembered.
She decides to try again, the others seeing her off on the rooftop. This time, she must change the past in a way that doesn't change the past, just as Okabe learned that he must change the past in a way that still left Makise Kurisu in a pool of blood. Here, Makise Kurisu must change the past in a way that still make Okabe Rintarou become Hououin Kyouma, that still leads the young man to become the mad scientist who saves his friends -- if in a different way.
She knows little of Okabe's personal history, has little to go on. The key is found in understanding her own emotional distance toward others, toward her family, toward Okabe -- I'm trying to avoid using *that* word, okay? While she is stubborn and cold toward the people she has known and been close to, she admits that she has wanted someone to call out to her, to be there for her.
This is important because it is basically what Okarin needs as well, for he is just as emotionally withdrawn as she is, unable to openly admit and reach for the people he values.
Just then, Okabe sits beside her, lost and confused because he cannot figure out how to help Mayuri with the passing of her grandmother. We're back to the beginning of the story as I told it. The woman I mentioned being Kurisu here. She covertly tells him the story of his future self, of the mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, telling him the story he needed to hear to help Mayuri -- not changing that past.
Now, what Suzuha told Kurisu to do is to anchor a powerful memory in his mind that will tie him to the Steins;Gate worldline. This is basically just more jargon that, on a thematic level, really means 'Show him that he's not alone. Show him that the story of Hououin Kyouma isn't a sad story' That is what will really bring Okabe back to reality, past the jargon about worldlines.
So, Kurisu takes his first kiss right there, and tells him to go to Mayuri. So he does. Soon, he remembers that girl who told him the story of Hououin Kyouma and kissed him, and he realized that it was Makise Kurisu, and he probably realized that she went back in time for him, that she had shared his path, that she had reached his heart.
'That's a sad story' 'Really? I think it's a wonderful story'
That's really, really beautiful, and don't you dare tell me otherwise.
I wish the movie would've put more effort into explicitly communicating what in fact occurred. Especially with the world line imagery, it would've been great if that showed the Steins;Gate and R worldlines, rotating around each other colliding together as Okabe came back to reality. This movie really needed an extra twenty minutes, because it took me at least an extra twenty minutes of thinking about all the details before this satisfied me as much as my words seem to suggest I was.
After this, she appears before him in the cold, desolate space he's been occupying, whatever you want to call it. He asks why she is here, and she replies that she didn't come to him, he's trying to come back. No one has forgotten him, they can't.
'You were so arrogant to think that you were holding up the world by yourself! Don't forget, no matter what world line you're on, you'll never be alone! I'll find you, wherever you are!'
So he smiles, characteristically holding his phone up to his ear, replying 'If that is the Steins;Gate's choice' acknowledging her will to value him, and acknowledging his own value in the process. As people fade back in, bringing us back to reality, he asks her if she'll return his first kiss to him, revealing that he remembers, or remembered -- it is not clear when that realization occurred. The presentation makes it seem like her appearing before him and speaking to him here and now caused him to realize it.
Either way, it works and it's really good! The end shot leaves us similarly to where episode 24 of the original show left us, a nice track plays and the credits roll.
The central meaning here, with two emotionally withdrawn hearts reaching one another, recognizing each other's value and their own, is that, as Kurisu says, we don't 'hold up the world' by refusing to acknowledge ourselves, by stoically casting ourselves aside. Each and every person, every soul, is a valuable and irreplaceable treasure. Far from holding up the world, if we disappear, if we don't acknowledge ourselves, we hold the world back by our absence, we leave a hole there that cannot be filled.
On a thematic level, like, holy shit, that is so, so good.
Steins;Gate uses its sci-fi platform, through all of its conceptual insanity, paradox, time travel and thrilling revelation, for the purpose of meaningful thematic beauty. It communicates the weight of moral agency and the deep value of the human person. I love it.",9
"
                It's a good anime - most visual novel-turned-anime are kind of annoying but this one was surprisingly well done. Strangely enough, it's sort of hard to follow, the little romance it has seems forced, the story keeps getting convoluted and drawn out, but the background plot and idea is strangely so good that it's hard to rank it anything less than a 7. I'm not a fan of sci-fi personally, but this anime does do a good job of that sci-fi genre without getting TOO otaku-ish (Evangelion, I'm looking at you). Also, how much you like the characters is definitely a big part of a
                  show, and every character in this show was enjoyable to watch. I normally hate tsunderes and blank-headed characters (it's worse when they're both) but in this one, the tsundere was subtle, and was technically a young genius, and the blank-headed one wasn't completely dumb as bricks, she's genuinely kind and has a different sort of brilliance. It's a good show, highly recommend just to say you've seen a show of that quality.",8
"
                Steins;Gate is about time travel. And believe it or not does it pretty damn well.  Steins;Gate is extremely entertaining and mind boggling. 
More details:
The story is absolutely awesome and it is not boring at the slightest. Usually with a concept as complicated as time travel which includes linear theorems would just confuse people and turn the show into a big turn-off. Steins;Gate does not suffer this, the story is easy enough to understand but still requires some thought process (just the right amount). It will keep you at the edge of your seat for the entire ride. There is one complaint that some people
                  refer that the story drags on way too much this is due to an event where the protagonist is forced to constantly  go back in time. I honestly liked how it dragged on because it displayed how the main protagonist felt, as he was reliving the same days constantly. There are VERY few events that are predictable, but to notice them depends on the caliber of your knowledge in anime. 
The art and sound is great, put simply. There is high value for this show's art and sound and you will be able to notice it right away.
I love the characters in this show they are all different and interesting in their own ways. Each having their own unique traits that can at times exclude them from society. Some characters are dynamic others static but no matter what they are still lovable and easy to follow along.
Overall Steins;Gate is a must watch.",9
"
                Steins Gate. Ive seen this title countless of times on Netflix, and always thought it was some super dry , slow paced boring show that tried to be extremely complex. I honestly dont know why i thought so , it was just the kind of feeling the show invoked in me , just by its title and the picture. And while it certainly is complex ( not that thats a bad thing) , boy i couldnt have been wrong more.
I eventually decided to give this Show a try out of pure boredom , and because i had nothing else to watch. This show thaught me
                  a few things. But most importantly it taught me to give more media a chance, and dont judge an anime by its cover. I before this only watched Shounen , and this show finally helped me to extend my taste and find joy in other genre.
Enough Personal history tho, lets review the Show:
Plot: The Plot of this story is just amazing. It starts off with a very strong first episode and then proceeds to make you get attached to the cast for the first few episodes until eventually Mayuris death changes everything. Suddenly Plotpoint after plotpoint comes up , one more amazing and shocking than the other. The Suzuha/ John Titor Plot was build up so well , on a rewatch i noticed so many small details and foreshadowing: Suzuha ( from episode 23 ) is shown in episode 1, obviously the scream and the dead Kurisu also come from there. Mr Braun trying to get in Okabes way with experiments makes since, because he doesnt want him dead. Suzuha recommending John Titor to him makes since because she ... well is John Titor. Her anxiety of planes and other stuff also makes since, because she has PTSD. There is way more of these details, i really recommend rewatching the series so you can see them foryourself, many of them cant be noticed on the first watch. Also, the time travel concept of Steins Gate is by far the best ive ever seen in media. Its just elegant and makes since, and never even once was its use inconsitent or had a plothole. Also i like how the show actually is about time travelling, its consequences and how its used to deal with those, instead of just time travelling at the beginning and end of a arc like lets say , Doctor Who. Its not a tool to get to a setting, its actually a main aspect of the story , that is used to its full potential , even the process of inventing time travel is shown , and thats just amazing to me. And then of course. The Way Okabe fails over and over again, the feelings during that, but also the amazing way of him finally getting closer to his goal , only to be faced with an even bigger obstacle in Kurisus death is just so well written. Then finally him finding the way out of this... its just so satisfying. Especially because it actually makes since, everything is explained, but never spoonfed to the audience, like i said, a lot is subtile and needs the viewer to pay attention. Besides Code Geass, Steins Gate has the to me best ending in all of anime. Its just so beatifully written, the way Okabe finally regains hope in his iconic scene on the rooftop, finally gets back his resolve and hope after being broken down so many times. Then finally gets his last shot at saving everything he needs to, and finally , suceeding. The way he has to stab himself scares you, will he die  , will he be okay ? And then that scene of him wishing himself great luck for the next week... its just too good. Let alone the actual ending scene. I really thought this show would end with him saving her and never seeing her again, on a bittersweet note. But after showing all characters, showing him reestablish the Lab with all the members he learned to cherish so much in the series, out of no where there it is. They meet again, and its even hinted at how she is starting to regain some of her memories. Cant really get better than this. The way this show ended is just perfect. I wouldnt want to end a single thing to it. And thats the point of the ending.  ""A new, free world noone has ever witnessed, everything can happen , as this meeting shows.""
Art: Steins Gate does have beatiful Art and many iconic Shots. My only complaint would be that the action scenes really feel a bit.. off. Namely, the scene of Suzuha defeating Moekas minions , but even this scene makes it up by giving us that iconic shot of their pistol faceoff. However the animation is fluid and the overall Artstyle itself is just beatiful, my favorite scene would probably be the "" Event Horizon "" and my god did they do this scene justice. The show just has this certain 90years vibe to it , and the Art Style plays a big role in that. Also the character Designs are just amazing and on POINT. Kurisu is probably one of the most iconic female characters just trough her amazing design already. I like how without doing much the designs really just show what kind of character you have. Okabe is this ""mad scientist"" but hes also a student. Some lazy trousers with a base T-Shirt, and a lab coat for his chunibyo. Daru is also a student, and hes a hacker, so it kinda fits him to not do anything fancy, so he wears a cap to protect his head and a base outfit, but somehow all of this designs deliver by doing not even much.
Sound: Man... Gate of Steiner might be my favorite Song in anime. But there is many more . The soundtrack is just amazing. Only in the action scenes its a little... off , which makes since considering these rarely appear. Also the overall sound design is fantastic and fits the vibe of the show a lot. For example the cicadas sound really relaxes me and fits the atmosphere a lot.
Character: Okabe and Kurisu are both in my top 5 characters of all time. Hes just an amazing protag whos insanely fun to watch, compelling and well written. Also he just has so much development troughout the series. Seeing this man suffer, laugh , build bounds and sacrifice them is just so emotionally engaging. And somehow you can relate to him so much. Hes awkward and uses humor because he cant express what hes really feeling, however troughout the series he learns it bit by bit. Until hes even able to confess his love. Yeah and to who ? To Kurisu Makise, the greatest Female Character of ALL time. Never reduced to being a basic love interest or the "" damsel in distress"" i just love this character. She has a lot of issues herself, shes awkward around people, barely interacts with her mother and is hated by her dad, an awkward Girl-Prodigy that has always been alone and finally finds a place to belong. Then she has to give up her life and even the memories of so said Place to save a dear friend. The amount of development this character gets is just insane, almost equal to the actual protagonist even. All the other characters are also great, but none of them come close to Okabe and Kurisu, tho Suzuha also really is amazing. The bounds and interactions between all of these awkard loners are just t funny and reletable. Watching them is just fun. Also even the sidecast gets really good sidearcs like Ruka / Feyris with their respective episode ( twice) and Daru and Suzuha who also have one of the best sideplots in the story. Another thing, i love how Okabe loves Kurisu for her personality , and not even once mentions that she has good looks in his confession, thats how you do romance right. Also it has been built up a lot better , and felt way more natural than it normally does in anime.
Enjoyment: I think its pretty clear by now, i enjoyed this show, and i enjoyed it a lot. The interactions are fun , the humor on point, you can relate and the show delivers as a piece of art (sound / visuals) . The emotional scenes hit way too deep and you can relate a lot more than you should with characters that see their dearest friends die over and over again, but also with their awkard shy sides and everything else. I could go and ond , but lets just end this category by saying i rarely enjoy a show in its entirety as much as this one, in fact only two other shows come to my mind rn.
Conclusion: Steins Gate is an amazing masterpiece that i cant praise enough, its really a One of Kind Show, that also happens to resonate a lot with me , i just like shows with this kind of vibe a lot.",10

                Spoilers incoming.
Story: 9/10. Most people here say the characters are what makes Steins;Gate, but for me its the story. The setting up of the rules and logic of time travel and expanding on them; the interesting situations that come about through manipulating time; how the characters end up creating new, unexpected situations that need to be resolved; in all honesty, all of these captivated my interest more than the characters. The story doesn't really have any specific direction for the first half other than ""build this prototype time machine and see how we can manipulate time with it"", but it's very necessary in establishing an
                  understanding for how time works in Steins;Gate. Without this, the events of the second half cannot be fully understood. Unfortunately, despite the well-grounded narrative, most people tend to drop the show due to the slower-style pacing in the first half, coupled with the feeling that the story isn't going anywhere with its characters. An understandable sentiment, but a rushed one in my opinion.
Art: 9/10, not much to say here.
Sound: 9/10. Great music, felt there were some tracks that could've been played more and some tracks that felt overused, but it didn't make that much of a difference since all the tracks are well composed. Also, the voice acting is phenomenal, particularly for Okabe. 
Character: 7/10. There's a wide range of depth among characters. I was surprised that people found the characters were the strongest aspect of the show. I feel some of the characters of the show come off as rather weak, but the relationships between the characters are pretty interesting to see play out amongst the chaos of changing world lines and moving back in time sporadically.
Some of the characters in Steins;Gate don't really have alot going for them outside of their roles for progressing the events of the story. Outside of being a genius scientist, Kurisu is just a generic tsundere who occasionally brings up issues she has with her father. Mayushii just acts cute all the time and says ""tuturuu"". And Moeka, well, she doesn't have a personality at all. Really, the only characters I found likeable outside of their roles within the story were Daru, Okabe and Suzuha.
The depth we find here is really in how far the characters will go for one another. For example, we see how far Okabe will go to save Mayushii, and how throughout the process he is broken numerous times, and how this impacts the decisions and choices he makes, thereby creating interesting new paths within the narrative. The characters aren't really noteworthy by themselves, but the situations presented by how they interact is what I feel makes the show something interesting.
Enjoyment: 8/10. The first half of the show was comedic and fun to watch, and set forth the ground rules and logic for the rest of the show in a rather remarkable way, such that the audience could accept it and understand it. The second half is then able to build off this foundation, introducing even more interesting applications of time travel while still being comedic when it wants to but also serious when the time calls for it. That's not to say there isn't an overdilution of one or the other; sometimes the comedy drags on for too long and takes away the impact of a prior serious moment, or the reverse. Also, I personally enjoyed the first 12 or so episodes before the 'main' plot actually kicked in, but I acknowledge many people get turned off by these first 12 episodes because nothing notably interesting happens.
Overall: 8/10. If you're one of those guys who expects a time-travel show to not have plot-holes, you're out of luck; such a show will never exist. However, I can say for certain Steins;Gate is probably the closest thing you'll get to a show that sets forth reasonable rules and premises for time travel and follows them soundly in the context of an interesting, well-driven narrative. In fact, Steins;Gate is probably the best time-travel work I've experienced. However, the episodes seem to drag when the narrative isn't the main focus, and although they can be very humurous at times, the weak cast (excluding Okabe and Daru) can make for uninteresting events until the plot comes into focus again. Also, I felt the show suffered major pacing issues at times when Okabe was undoing world lines; some episodes felt more like an explicit harem anime where Okabe was rejecting the 'final endings' with the female supporting characters. Luckily the story picks up soon after and stays engaging til the end.",8
"
                While Steins;Gate was interesting and thought provoking, it did seem very ""hyped"". Many people claim this anime is the ""best"". It is not the best. Only later on does this anime prove to be worthy in my opinion. The first couple of episodes was very boring but as it went on, it became worthy of a score of an 8. 
Story is decent in the fact that it is based on true events. I enjoy sci-fi and this anime proved to feed my love and passion for time travel. 
The characters were OKAY at the best. At many times the so called, ""mad"" scientist frustrated
                  me and his over the top attitude was also annoying. The rest of the characters were decent.
The sound was fantastic. I loved how the sound was used in Steins;Gate. 
The art is okay, nothing new or crazy, just anime.
Enjoyment level was about 6 in the beginning but as the story developed, I really enjoyed it. It did play with my emotions a bit and there were times when I could really empathize with the lead character. 
Overall this anime was decent. It doesn't deserve the score of a 10 or 9. Its very over hyped.",8
"
                Story-10
I can not express the amazingness of the Steins;Gate Story, everything is thought of, every possibility is thought about and the twists and turns and the sudden ""oh shit"" moment in episode 12 your jaw will be hanging out in Australia cause it just comes out of nowhere and works perfectly. The ending of Steins;Gate will have you in shambles from the intensity and the overall amazingness of it.
Art-8
There's nothing to complain about the art here, it is very good but nothing out of this world, there were points when the characters were talking but their mouths weren't moving so that was weird (maybe its
                  just a dub thing, I didn't watch the sub) the character designs were simple but recognizable and overall it was just very good.
Sound-10
The ost in Steins;Gate was exceptional, the music was always played at the perfect time and was never overused. The op Hacking Into The Gate is one of my favourites of all time and the ending was just as good. The sound effects used were soooo amazing and fit in with the show perfectly.
Character-12
If Mal let me put a 12 then It would be a 15 because the characters in Steins;Gate are unmatched by any other anime out there. Okabe Rintaro is my favourite anime character of all time and Kurisu Makise is in my top 10. The main group is so believable and just have fantastic chemistry bouncing off of each other like crazy. There is absolutely nothing negative to say about the characters of this show, just phenomenal.    
Enjoyment-10
the first three or four episodes I'd say are a little hard to get through because it's kind of boring but after a big reveal it gets just outstanding, you will enjoy yourself watching Steins;Gate and that is a guarantee. And if you don't then I do not understand you whatsoever.
Overall-10
It is my favourite anime of all time, nothing even sands close to the perfection steins gate reaches.",10

                What more do I need to say other than this anime is a masterpiece. There is literally no other way to put it. Sure it may seem slow at the beginning, but when the anime starts to get really good, you'll want to watch more. This is an anime you just need patience for. I won't make promises, I will say though that once the anime gets to the amazing part, you likely won't regret having made it that far. Once you begin to understand things, I doubt you will have any hate left for this anime. You'll probably end up wanting to rewatch it
                  after realizing how beautifully executed this anime really is.
The only reason why 99% of the haters don't like this anime is because they find it boring from the start simply because they are puzzled as to what is going on in the anime. It can be confusing in the beginning, but the later episodes explain things right off the bat!!! It's like they are giving you the answers. So there is no need to worry about feeling stupid while watching this anime. The other 1%, however, is nothing but BS! You might hear something like ""Okabe is a decent main character"" and blah blah blah. From my own perspective, I'm here to tell you that that's false. As you see from the start he is a character that likes to pull all sorts of jokes on his lab members, such as faking a phone call about an organization spying on them, and is more of a carefree mad scientist whose dream as shown in the beginning was to develop a time machine. As he transverses through time, he gains more affection towards his lab members and slowly changes eventually as he learns a painful truth that he cannot save all the people that he loved from a specific world line. Other than character development, I would say that this anime has immense plot twists. Some of which you wouldn't expect to happen at all. This is one factor that makes thriller anime super enjoyable because you don't know what will happen next. It is almost like the entire plot was planned from the start and it was perfectly written. As you keep watching the anime, you may end up growing stronger bonds for the characters in the anime and may end up wanting to watch more. The world building and graphics all seem too amazing to ignore. The opening and ending songs very well suit the theme for this anime(Time travel), would give a 10/10. Do I even need to say anything else??? This anime is just as perfect as, if not, better than FMAB!!! I personally feel like this should've been number 1 on MAL(MyAnimeList.com). If you want to know when the anime gets better, I'd say it develops from ep. 9 and then ep. 12 and after are all just phenomenal. As I have said earlier, the later episodes tie EVERYTHING back in, so don't get worried about being confused. I know I've been doing nothing besides rambling about how much I love this show, but if you give this a watch all the way through you will likely agree with me.
For the order, I personally just watched episodes 1-22 of the first season and then 23 beta since that's what the majority of the people are saying, I still have yet to watch Steins;Gate 0 and OVAs. There are others out there that are saying otherwise, however. Some are saying you shouldn't watch episode 23 beta before finishing the first 24 or 25 episodes as it is simply the alternative ending to the anime and that you should rewatch it if you follow the popular order.",10
"
                I found this anime quite difficult to watch, mainly due to the slow pace in the beginning of the show and some confusing aspects which do not improve, when i put the anime on hold for a few weeks. Overall the show is quite well written, aside from the realism that comes with backward time travel (get to that later), and the strange, empty city setting also provided some boring aspects of the show. In all honesty, i did develop an attachment to the devotion and perseverance of okabe, and a general gravitation toward the cheerful nature and ever-happy attitude of mayuri, especially with regard
                  to her cute tu~tu~ru! greeting and her innocent grasp on the situations occurring in the story line. In regards to the physics of the show, i think a little less sci-fi could have been implied, to give the anime a more modern and 'possible' feel. First of all, the speed limit of the universe (speed of light), so to speak, is basically going to deny any substance or object to time travel backwards in time....period. to reach the speed of light, someone or something must be able to compress to the size of a particle, then explode back out to a human, solid existence which is blatantly impossible. This pretty much means that there is no possible solution to backward time travel, as backward would mean that okabe and kurisu would have to reach, and exceed the speed of light, defying all that is known and somehow compressing further into nothingness. The only possible outcome that is still technically impossible, would be for the cute couple to somehow reach the speed of light and stay there, in which time would stand still whilst they impossibly maintain 300,000 kilometers a second velocity. They may be able to get very close, meaning that they age at their own rate in relation to the speed whilst the world ages around them and they placed in a time-slowed medium, however they will never truly stop time because lets face it, they are not particles of light. all in all, i give this show 8 gel-bananas out of 10",8

                I had the poor misfortune of watching Re:Zero before Steins;Gate, thinking I knew what I was in for. I was gravely mistaken. 
Steins;Gate goes after many different goals and achieves almost every single one flawlessly. With a large setup for an equally large punchline, I was fully invested in the characters, story, and stage till the closing curtains drew in. The greatest successes had to relate to two factors: Atmosphere and Story.
Atmosphere: While I enjoyed each character as individuals, the greater contribution to this series' success is their group and couple interaction. Consistently, I had pairings I hoped would interact more often. Every time one
                  character talked to another, the mood, the lighting, the music, and all contributions were completely set to make for enthralling dialogue and reactions. Additionally, while some of the references might seem dated now, I found myself constantly engaged in hearing them. Often this show felt like I had opened a history book of what 2010 was like. All in all, I felt dread, happiness, relief, sadness, and intrigue whenever the show writers wanted me to: right on schedule.
Story: I'll admit my bias. I'm a sucker for Illuminati style intrigue. Hell, the Deus Ex series is one of my favorite video game franchises. The story regarding SERN, time-travel, the future, and the past is all my jam. This series just hit every button it was going for regarding the story. Hope, dreams, despair, and fate are all great topics that are drawn into the narrative to encourage you to keep pushing through even at your lowest points. You feel along with the protagonist, and the story's machinations are what keep you and him chugging along until the very end.
This series is a complete gem of it's time. While it nearly drove me insane with grief, I'm glad to have watched it.",9
"
                The concept of time travel will make anyone stay thrilled...if you can get to the episode 7 plot twist. Also be prepared for moderate amounts of fan service, harem genre, supernatural, romance, and suspense.
I knew this would start slow but I didn't realize how slow.
From episodes 1-6 the pacing is incredibly slow. I didn't like the amount of fan service just to fill up the time in episodes 1-6. Some details are needed for making the episode 7 plot twist worth it and to build for the future arcs but there is nothing memorable about these episodes except for the tiny twists that build up
                  the series.
The moment you get to that plot twist in the middle of Episode 7 it's one of the best anime ever created. It gives you twists and turns from episode to episode.
Episodes 7-10 are interesting episodic episodes that help the main character and the viewer figure out what's going on. This intertwines well into episode 11 and by episode 12 this is where the legend of Steins;Gate really begins.
From here it's a mad scientist's dream for time travel. It gets extremely suspenseful due to the plot and all of the arcs have a sense of urgency. The arcs from here on out are masterful.
The art, sound, and animation are good.
I wish I could give this a 10 but the first 1/4 is a so-so slice of life with tiny specs of what is to come.
9/10",9

                My god, this anime is amazing. I have seen it twice, with an almost 5 year interval between those two, being this the 4th anime I've ever watched, and after a long time, and seeing a lot of shows and animes and reading a lot of manga, I've decided to write a review about it. Also, this is the very first review I've made, so I'm sorry if it isn't all that good. This one Contains minor spoilers, I've tried my best, but it was a little hard to do so, in the story part.
Story: 9.5/10
I won't post a summary, as I've seen a lot
                  of people do on their reviews, since, according to the MAL guidelines for reviews, ""users already have the synopsis written for them"". It starts off slow, but after around 10 episodes, it takes a huge 180 and it starts being an all out f*ckfest for Rintarou Okabe. The story is incredibly well written, I have always loved and read almost everything related to time travels on the internet and in books and thesis. almost nothing feels forced and flows in a natural way.  I don't think that the start is ""too slow"", but I'm a bit biased, I'm legit reading Rent-a-Girlfriend and following it weekly, and legit nothing happens for f*ckin 190 chapters. And I also have to point out how we can see how all of those time leaps that Okarin does start to break him little by little and change his character, ooh... Props to that, It is really well made, have only seen something like that in Re:Zero! But... I fell like there are a few parts that feel kinda forced... I am trying to keep this spoiler free, but the outcome of ""Mr. Braun"", I felt like it was a bit sudden and didn't really make much sense. How do some of the characters find their way into the lab? Sometimes, they just... appear out of nowhere, I can't really explain it. It just doesn't feel right. 
I know, I know, these are just tiny details, but well, I'm writing what I thought, I still gave it a 10/10 on the story rating though.
Art: 10/10
the animation and the art itself if incredibly good, at least for 2011 standards. There isn't much I can say about this, because I'm no expert, Maybe someone that reads this  I just really loved the opening and some of the moments were complete sakuga material.
Sound: 7/10
To me, this is the weakest part of this anime. Don't get me wrong, the voice actors do an AMAZING job, all of them are incredible and convey every single emotion really well, some of the best I've heard. Even after watching almost 200 anime after this one, I could still remember some of their lines, something that didn't even happen with almost any other show, apart from Re:Zero and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. However I am giving this a 7/10 because of the sound effects. Some of them made me laugh, like, all of a sudden I felt like they were recorded 10 years prior to the anime itself! The characters drawing a gun, or the stabbing, for example. It is really weird, because some of them are pretty good, and all of a sudden, the quality just... drops. It was actually unsettling for me and took me out of the immersion, since I take sound effects really seriously. But hey, I've worked with music and sound ever since I was 3 years old, and I'm 19 now, so I think it won't be that big of a deal for 99% of people.
Characters: 10/10
I think the characters are all well written. Pretty much everything they do reflects their personality, and nothing feels like it didn't belong to that character. Well, maybe what ""Mr. Braun"" does to himself, that I'm sure you'll know what I mean after you watch it. But hey, that's just a tiny detail I guess, I personally woudn't write that.
Enjoyment: 10/10
My god, I loved every single second of this show. When I watched it the first time, I remember that I've watched the first 13 episodes in a row! That didn't really happen this time, because I guess I don't really have much time for it now, but I loved every single bit, and I would watch it again and again, just to be with those characters a bit longer... 
Overall: 9/10
I am only giving this a 9 out of 10 because of the sound effects. I just can't let that slide. I loved every single bit, but man... those legit made me laugh at very serious moments of the show...
Please, YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS! There's a reason why this is rated as the 3rd best show in MAL at the time of writing and after 10 years it's still at 10th in popularity. It is one the best anime I've watched yet, and I guess I could say that made me look at some of the actions I make in a different way. If you ever get the chance, you should definitely put every anime you're watching on hold and see this as soon as possible.",9
"
                (I want to say if you are interested at all in watching this show pleases stop reading any reviews and just do it, I consider everything a spoiler no matter what I'm watching I even avoid all trailers so yeah.)
Let me just say before I talk in depth about this Anime. You know when people tell you over and over to watch something. Then you don't watch it out of spite? well, I'm not sure if anyone did but every time I saw this Anime it made me think of death note (Which I'm pretty certain I will never watch cause I'm sick of hearing
                  about it) and even though I'm sure they're totally not similar I still refused to watch it for ages.
Oh, boy am I glad I watched this though as this is a phenomenal show, I love the story, I love the characters, I love the feel, I hate that I'm done watching it. Though that's mainly because there are like 4 visual novels and I know I've missed great stories that I can't be arsed to play (But I want to).
Who is Rintarou Okabe? He's a mad scientist, he's Hououin Kyouma. This man loves his friends greatly and he would do anything to save them, his character is so well written that he's crazy but relatable, I'm actually not sure if I've ever seen a character completely like his, and if I have they were never this convincing.
So you like time travel? You like short stories that intertwine? You like conspiracies? Well, it's all here so put all that in a blender and add side characters what do you get? A mess. If it were any other show. because here you get an amazing show with a well written main and side characters with plausible actions and an interesting story which keeps you on your toes trying to figure it out before they tell you, basically you will be hitting the next so button faster than you thought you could.
What is Steins gate? Nothing? No simply a journey to the 1%.",9
"
                Spoiler review.
I think this was very enjoyable. I like the plot making you forget about things, such as the murder of Kurisu. Okabe spends so much time fighting to save Mayuri's life that he forgets that, after he tramples on the wishes of his friends by undoing their D-mails, he will go back to the beta world line where Makise Kurisu dies. I also really like Okabe Rintarou. He is a fascinating character. I love his ""mado sientisuto"" facade. He is hilarious.
However, I hate the harem aspect of this anime, which is somewhat isolating as a female viewer.  Well it can't be helped, as the anime was adapted from some visual novel where okabe can end up with different women. I don't know, I have mixed feelings. Okabe is a pretty interesting and kind person so it makes sense that more than one woman could fall in love with him like Ruka and Feris did. I don't know, it just seems too convenient, especially since they never revealed who Amane's mother was, probably so as not to ruin the harem illusion for the men who self insert into Okabe. 
I also hate the trap, because no man can actually look like a petite anime girl. I hate that Ruka is drawn exactly the same in his/her female form as the original male form. It relates to current issues today where some men actually think like that and want to be some sort of femboy or actual girl or whatever, but that's a different story.
The expressions can sometimes be flat in contrast to the passionate voice acting.
Overall, any flaws that the story has can be made up for in story, plot elements, fictional logic, humor, and aesthetic.",9
"
                This is an amazing anime no doubt. Outstanding story and unbelievably unique characters that will stay with you forever. Unbelievably strong character development and plot structure. This is one of those anime's that you could easily re-watch the early episodes and every time you do you will end up connecting more dots - ""oh, so that's why that happened! I get it now!"", you will think to yourself.
The first 11 episodes are slow paced but for a reason. Don't give up watching because the early episodes are necessary to set the context for the outstanding story that follows. If you stick with this anime past
                  the midpoint, you will not regret it. Episode 12 is where the action starts and from there the action doesn't stop until the end.
Okarin, the main character is amazing . You will laugh with him, cry with him, and feel with him throughout his journey. Some characters seem annoying at first, but they grow on you too, so be patient. Honestly, everything about this anime is unique; the characters are unique, the plot is unique, the writing is unique; it's unlike anything I've ever seen before and that is what makes it so wonderful.
One of the best anime's I have ever seen.
If you are looking for a compelling story and strong character development, look no further.",9
"
                After some calm first chapters - although we already attend to some key event in history -, soon Steins; Gate grips the spectator with his trepidante rhythm and excellent script. Thus, the well-traveled temporary trips are more than justified. After the amazing cliffhanger that takes place in chapter twelve the series does nothing but improve, and Okabe, in his desperate struggle to save Mayuri is consolidated as one of the greatest characters with whom server has been in an anime. The always brilliant Makise Kurisu, with whom the protagonist maintains an interesting idyll, is not behind him.
In short, one of the best animes of 2011
                  for whom this subscribed, perhaps only surpassed by Madoka Magica.",8
"
                The truth is, the start of this show kinda sucked for me. It was super boring, pretty cringy, and I didn't really relate to any of the characters. 
This all changed about half way through the show. Events take place that entirely change the tone, the revealed personalities of the characters, and even things like the music and art. If you've watched the show, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, or you haven't gotten that far, I promise, it gets better. 
In a way, that end half wouldn't be possible without the first. It's hard to explain why, but its true. Either
                  way, it did affect my overall experience with the show. It's hard to say its a perfect show if I truly didn't enjoy the first half, even if the second half is a masterpiece with its foundation on the former. 
As for the rest of the components of the show, not much more can be said that hasn't already. This show does an amazing job with time travel, constantly keeping you on your toes and making you think for hours after each episode. There are almost no glaring plot holes - a true achievement in this genre. The art and sound are works of art, and certain scenes feel like they're straight out of a water color art gallery. 
One complaint is that it can be a little predictable. A few of the ""big reveals"" were fairly obvious for a while, which might be purposeful - I'm not sure. 
End of the day, it's a good show. I feel like a lot of the 10/10 reviews are from people who either feel as though the slow start was completely worth it in the end, or who bizarrely enjoyed those first episodes.",8
