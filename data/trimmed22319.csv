                Remember when you were little and you tried to bake that really awesome cake following the instructions on a cooking-book and ended up forgetting half the ingredients or using the wrong ones and the cake looked like complete shit and shit was all over the kitchen and then your mother walked in and slapped you across the face? Whether or not you remember, if you can picture that scenario then you can picture how Studio Pierrot's attempt at adapting Tokyo Ghoul into an anime unfolded. 
Lets actually start off with the ""good"" in Tokyo Ghoul. Why? Because it's one sentence long so lets get it
                  out of the way shall we.
The soundtrack is decent. The opening theme is good, and the ending theme is pretty catchy. Ok so that was two sentences. 
I'm going to fess up now and admit that I have not read the manga although I'm aware that it's a lot better and that they crammed 60 chapters into 12 episodes. This review will be based on the anime alone, which I believe is more correct then the people giving this adaption a break solely for their admiration of the manga. 
The worst aspect of Tokyo Ghoul are the characters and their development. Frankly I'm not going to talk about any of the characters aside from Kaneki because there is nothing to say about them after 12 episodes.
Kaneki is worth talking about because he is a boy born with a vagina..oh and he is a also a half-ghoul, almost forgot about that. As the MC of Tokyo Ghoul, Kaneki's main role is to disappoint us to death, cry a lot, and bitch a lot about how much he sucks.
With the characters being so dreadful, the anime relied heavily on the plot and the violence. The plot is very broad in the anime: Humans vs Ghouls and Ghouls vs Ghouls. At least that's what I got from 12 episodes adapted from 60 chapters. The violence is censored so that sucks, but apparently the DVD versions will be uncensored..cool, anyways moving on. The most pretentious thing about Tokyo Ghoul are the attempts at emotionally moving the audience by having some characters we know nothing about die and seeing other characters feel sad while the soundtrack playing assures us that this is indeed meant to be an emotional scene...awkward.
 So about right now you're probably thinking to yourself that I don't have much to say about this anime. I just felt like reviewing this anime cause I wanted to write down that whole baking a cake comparison after which my passion ran out. This is much like the folks at Studio Pierrot. They had no passion whatsoever in the making of this anime, taking advantage of the fact that the manga is extremely popular and doing the most minimalist job possible. 
With all this I thought I would take joy in witnessing how badly this train-wreck could end, and to my surprise they actually took that pleasure from me as well. The last 10 minutes of the last episode were legitimately entertaining. Right at the end, the show introduced moral ideas worthy of involving the audience and I found myself enjoying Tokyo Ghoul for the first time. What a bunch of trolls eh.",5

                1) This is a rewriting of one of the first reviews I ever made, I deleted it because I did not know what the hell I was talking about.
2) There will be some minor spoilers, you've been warned ye little b-
You know those stories that have these special entities that live in a world and pretty much kind of like x-men? Well recently that idea has been done a lot, out of most of the things that have done this idea recently, Parasyte is the only one that succeeds in doing it well, Beside it is this mess. Tokyo Ghoul, when I saw this show
                  I thought it was gonna be some generic mystery show and when I started watching it......it was a generic x-men idea show, how wonderful? And guess what?It became popular and people praised it, now I'm currently taking my time reading the manga (which is better than this) so I won't be mentioning it. 
Story: 3.7/10
So in this world there are entities known as 'Ghouls' who feed off human corpses and drink coffee. Yes, coffee. So one day a freshman college student goes out with some girl and it turns out, SHE'S A GHOUL! DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN!!!! So after an accident before getting eaten, doctors thought it was such a smart idea (not) to take the ghoul's organs and stuff them into our MC. What happens? The MC is know a half ghoul, half human and struggles to maintain each side.
Cool idea right? Well you're wrong, the show fails to make the plot understandable, its such a mess, the reason why is that it never explains jackshit. For example, how do people turn into ghouls? What the hell is a ward? How do ghouls drink coffee but nothing else except water? What is this world? and so on. The show does the thing were it tries to solve everything in just 12 episodes, and this show fails it miserably, this show needs 24 episodes to space everything out, everything feels so rushed, cause of this it leads to the plotholes and cause of the plotholes its more confusing. I'll give it points for its idea but thats it.
Characters: 4/10
Our MC  is Kaneki, I talked about him in my story segment, here I'll say whats good about him and whats bad. Now the good is we find out his life is pretty tragic, his mom dies as a kid, he can't eat normal anymore, it really makes you feel for him. The way he tries to keep his humanity and ghoulness is so well done and I give prontos to that. The bad side, the show hardly focuses on him, it tries to focus more on the world around him, this is really the main sector of why everything is messy. Cause of this Kaneki feels more like a plot-device more than anything.
Now the other characters, there isn't really much to say about them, there's Touka, there is meant to be some development between her and Kaneki but there isn't, its like the show is saying, hey look developme- NOPE FUCK YOU! As soon as the development can happen its just vanishes. This leads to so much under-development.
The other characters, there isn't really much to them and usually don't matter to the plot at all, there's so many chances for some good development and the show fucks that up too.
Sound: 9/10
Ok now the music, is just....epic. Its really well done and is so memroble. The OP, I don't know what to say. It is amazing and it looks at how ghouls and humans are equal and makes you question yourself and humanity? Are monsters really created by humans? The ED, is pretty meh. And thats really it for sound.
Art: 6/10
The art is pretty OK with some really well done backgrounds that shine, I'd give it a 7, but I won't cause of something in the animation which actually made me want to drop the show and its.....Censoring. There's a lot of blood in this show and it tries to censor it, but it does it so poorly, it uses black bars to censor things, it literally blackens nearly the whole screen and you wonder what the fuck is going on?
Enjoyment: 5/10
Welp really, the only reason I didn't drop this was cause of its action scenes and litlle cliffhangers at the end of each episode. The action scenes are really well done and put you on the edge of your seat. The cliffhangers, man these cliffhangers are a reason to continue the show, they usually leave big ones making you what to see what happens next. 
Overall: 4.5/10
This show is a mess, it has some well done music and thats the best thing it has to offer, the rest is just either poorly done or rushed. This show could have been something really good but it falls on its ass everytime it has a chance. The ending is a cliffhanger which is just a cheap move and a reason to watch Season 2. I don't really reccomend this, shows that have done a better job of this are Parasyte which is STILL ONGOING (by the time this review is posted) and Tokyo Esp which is an OK show, its more light-hearted but it does a much better job than this. Tokyo Ghoul is meh. I'm out.",4

                Horror movies are amusing at times to watch. Sure, their intent is to strike fear into viewers but most times, they are so predictable and saturated with tropes that it almost seems like a cruel joke. Tokyo Ghoul doesn’t derive far from that. Despite being much longer than a typical horror movie, the series plays around with itself so much that it almost becomes a laughter stock. Don’t get me wrong though. The intriguing idea of supernatural creatures known as ‘ghouls’ living among human communities is quite well-built when it comes with premise. However, the show ultimately kills itself with its execution. Based off of
                  the manga of the same name, I can say that they are almost like two different worlds.
The brainchild of Tokyo Ghoul is Sui Ishida as his first original work. Like the title implies, the series follows the idea of ghouls living among human population in Tokyo. They are regarded as savages and killers of injustice. News reports often sends the message that all ghouls must be eradicated in order for the world to be at peace. It becomes a near totalitarian-like state as the ghouls finds themselves at constant struggle for survival. If you don’t believe me, just ask Ken Kaneki. The young boy has a dark secret after one day as he comes face to face with the horror of reality.
Ask yourself first though: is Tokyo Ghoul a good adaptation of a horror story? At first, it does seem so with the premise. The first episode crafts the image well with the innocent Kaneki and his puppy crush on another woman named Rize. What comes next is a big surprise for him as his life spins out of control. This might be a surprise for him but is far too predictable for the viewers’ eyes to see. The beautiful girl with the mysterious aura, dark alley, and morbid news near Kaneki’s community should have all been hints that something terrible would happen to the boy soon. And exactly like that, Kaneki’s life is no longer human as he becomes part ghoul in Tokyo. 
Despite being part ghoul, the show sends the message that Kaneki wishes to live as a human instead. His love for literature and struggle to contain his appetite are proof of this. Emphasizing on his human traits, Kaneki fights against his gluttonous desire to consume human flesh. No matter how great the temptation is, we see how determined the kid to retain his humanity. This conventional idea isn’t uncommon at all though. Other series such as Claymore and Shiki also have similar ideas. Unfortunately, Tokyo Ghoul doesn’t develop this idea all too well. For instance, can we really sympathize with Kaneki? While he is a good role model for others, some of his roles in this adaptation are questionable. Furthermore, we don’t really know much about the young boy such as his backstory. Taking a closer glance at his character, Kaneki is more like a plot device himself to steer the engine of the premise. In retrospect, Kaneki is an underdeveloped character with minimal characterization and lack of focus. The mask he wear is a motif to his character but the anime adaptation neglects its value. 
Some focus are put together with the other characters throughout the show such as Toka Kirishima, a young girl and also a ghoul dubbed as “The Rabbit”. Other ghouls entering the story includes Nishiki NIshio, Hinami Fuegushi, Yoshimura, Gourmet, and among others. The funny thing about them is that despite being the ghouls, most of them are presented as protagonists while fighting for survival. It’s clear that society misunderstands them because of their gluttonous appetite for meat. Then, there’s also the Aogiri Tree that fits the profile that society that describes them as – brutal, violent, and craving to satisfy themselves. On the other hand, there’s the CCG, a Ghoul Investigation agency dedicated to battle against ghouls. I wouldn’t necessarily call them antagonists since their purpose is to secure the safety of the public. However, they do come head and head against Kaneki and the others. The consequence includes grief on both sides as they lose important people. It pinpoints the fact that lives are very fragile that can be taken away so easily whether you are a human or a ghoul.
A prominent character in CCG is Amon. Despite not being the main focus of the show, we find out about him more than almost any other character. These include his partnership with professional ghoul hunter Mado, his past, and how he became who he is today. Serving as a determined man, he has some similarities and differences with Kaneki. They both fight for what they believe in but with very different motivations.  But taking for granted, Amon can be considered a breakout character compared to others. The sad part is that he is perhaps one of the only character that some of us can relate to. Others such as Touka just lacks any distinctive traits or characterization for us to get to know well. Oh and don’t bother asking about Rize. Despite her being the main reason of Kaneki’s change, the show neglects to focus on her as a character at all and only shows her influence through the show in ridiculous diehard ways.
Several consideration should also be considered as the show explores prejudice, morality, and identity. Apparently, the public shows fear of the ghouls so the show wastes no time to label them as pure monsters. But ask yourself this: should all ghouls be considered as monsters? This can be controversial as some ghouls truly are unredeemable while others such as Kaneki and Nishiki have human values. Then, there’s the identity issue with various characters. Kaneki struggles to battle this the hardest out of any other character as he adapts to his new life. He must hide his ghoul tendencies from his neighbors, teachers, and even his best friend Hide. While all this seems to strike keen interest, it just feels repetitive and quickly grows old. The show just tries far too had when attempting to get viewers to realize what Kaneki strives to be.
Now comes perhaps the worst part of the show: the adaptation of the story. The craftsmanship had the right source material but it didn’t know what to do with it. Studio Pierrot failed to deliver a faithful adaptation with both the characters and the story. There’s little development with any of the characters and fails to achieve adequate accuracy with the main story. The main story cuts off important parts that were hugely influential to certain outcomes. It lacks credible built-up, has a poor execution, and is ultimately beyond salvage at a certain point. For the characters, most of them suffer from development and characterization. While we can feel sympathetic at times, it’s hard to relate to them at all. Most of them aren’t good role models besides Kaneki. Furthermore, the relationship he builds with others is vaguely expressed. Touka often gets into arguments with Kaneki while Nishiki picks on him as a weakling. Hinami’s relationship with Kaneki has some innocence to it but really lacks compatibility. There’s also a sense of hate between some ghouls but most of this is degenerated to weak expression because of its pacing. In retrospect, this adaptation lies in the ruins.
Despite all this, Tokyo Ghoul is a horror fest when it comes to action. The artwork of the series is done well visually to capture the gruesome moments in the ghoul world. Speaking of which, the ghouls themselves are designed with monstrous traits such as their razor sharp teeth, scarlet eyes, and body structure. The ghoul’s predatory organ known as the Kagune is designed to look artistically endearing with blood-like muscles. Although the show doesn’t focus too much on the mechanics, it’s easy to tell that they are a race to be feared. Likewise, most of the other character designs are designed with accuracy. I say this because of their ability to blend in with human society despite being ghouls. Just take a good look at Nishiki. The background and dark chilling atmosphere also has noir-like feeling to provoke power. Overall action coordination remains top notch with cinematic battles scenes from start to finish. I just hope the BDs will remove the horrid censorship from the TV series.
On the soundtrack front, the show’s delivery is effective. It shows enough ways to get most of the job done. In fact, the very first minutes of the series wastes little time with its high volume of violence. The haunting tones strikes fear with both wish-fulfillment brutality and chaos. Voice expressions too crafts the imagery of our characters’ struggles. I also give credit to Kana Hanazawa who is able to play the character Rize. She was able to convey the character as a graceful beauty until her true visage is revealed. Others such as Toka and Gourmet have distinctive ways of speaking similar to those of a tomboy and aristocrat respectfully. Finally, the OP and ED songs are beautiful and well decorated. 
To say the least, Tokyo Ghoul is an adaptation gone wrong when it comes to story and characters. The way it is adapted is a degeneration of its original source. But if you’re coming in as an anime original viewer, then this show might be something to take a keen interest on especially when it comes to the cinematic battles. The first episode will hook you in but the rest of them lacks that sort of development. Although there are some occasional comedy, the majority of the show takes itself seriously, perhaps sometimes for its own good. I wouldn’t call Tokyo Ghoul a hollow shell of what it should be though. Rather, it’s more of an adaptation that should have been handled differently. VERY differently.",5

                Prior knowledge
Manga: None
Tokyo Ghoul is one of the more hyped up anime this season for a number of reasons. Mainly because it was, as I have heard, a very popular manga. The premise itself is easy to follow. The world is inhabited by two types of people: regular people and ghouls who eat people as a source of food. The main character, Kaneki Ken, after almost being killed by a ghoul is turned into a half ghoul-half human hybrid. By this time, I, who has not read the manga, assumed the show would explore the morality of and question the prejudice between the two groups
                  using the MC as a focal perspective. While at the same time having some kickass fight sequences.
Boy was I wrong.
Story – 6/10
For the most part, Tokyo Ghoul’s storytelling was decent. It explored the different aspects of the ghoul community and made its point simple and concise. Although that’s about it. There isn’t anything too fancy or well done with its storytelling. Tokyo Ghoul is quick to establish the lore with the Wards (sectors), the Doves (anti ghoul police), and different types of ghouls. This last point emphasized by Anteiku and it’s here that Kaneki spends most of his time deliberating between his new and unique situation. The plot itself didn’t seem to be headed in any clear direction, but splits itself into different ‘mini-plots’ (similar to different story arcs in the manga) as Kaneki observes the different ghouls coming in and out of the cafe, and learns their own perspective of being a ghoul. While this in itself is fine, it creates other problems for character development and overall pacing. This is clear at the show’s 9th episode when there is a ghoul invasion in one of the other wards. It’s clear that this is the climax of the show, yet it feels blatantly out of place from the ‘mini-arc’ format the show was using so far. There was hardly any buildup leading up to the massive invasion and the last 4 episodes seemed to compress as much content as possible by amping up the pace, shown by the sudden high stakes and side characters being quickly introduced. It’s clear the ending was very rushed. Simply put, the show’s plot lacked focus. It did not take advantage of the interesting premise they had to work with. 
Art – 8/10
I don’t have any complaints here. The animation is slick and smooth. The (very few) fights and battles are nice to watch. The weapons, qunique and kagune, were an interesting concept for the show and there were enough different types to show off. The show tended to lean toward more vivid colours in its art style and wasn’t afraid to use its full range of colours which I thought was a good decision for the show to make. 
The characters themselves are distinct from one another in their art design and colour and I particularly liked how a character’s colour was associated with their personality. It’s a welcome change from other anime where characters look way too similar to one another. The OP and ED sequences were great to watch and is one of the few shows where I don’t skip its sequences. I especially like theme of contrast and reflection used in the OP.
Sound – 8/10
There wasn’t anything wrong with Tokyo Ghoul’s sound direction. Overall effects in fight scenes were synced well and so was background noise. Each character had their own defined voice and the voice acting complimented well with the art and colour style. That is to say, their voices were a little more on the melodramatic side. But it was used to good effect in presenting their own personalities and character. The OP and ED are both fantastic and fit well into the tone of the show, or rather the tone the show was trying to show.
Character – 5/10
Here is where Tokyo Ghoul suffers from the most and ultimately hinders enjoyment of the show. The show has a lot of side characters. A new character is introduced maybe every 1 to 2 episodes and none of these characters get enough screentime and character development. The fault of this is partly due to its 1-cour situation, but it’s also because of the mini-plot format of the show. A new character is introduced who interacts with Kaneki in some way before being pushed to the sidelines a couple of episodes later and a new character takes the stage. There is barely any exposition for the side characters and the way they were simply dumped to the side until the climax arc in the 9th episode was simply lazy.
The main characters themselves are regrettably 2-dimensional. Kaneki’s initial panic with his newfound situation was acceptable at first but he never grew out of his timidness despite the abundant characters and small setting he was confined to. Unfortunately, the lack of development for the side characters also meant Kaneki’s character development also suffered as a result. Kaneki himself always seems to be in helpless situations which he can’t get out of. The only ounce of character development is during Hinami’s arc in Episode 3 where he sees that there are ghouls who don’t wish to kill people. His entire character is just a tease to the final episode when he goes all badass. And even that in itself is a disappointment. That wasn’t what I wanted to see from the show at all. 
Enjoyment – 6/10
I can tell you this. If you switch off your brain you’ll most likely enjoy this show. It doesn’t do anything new or unique within its own genre. Battles are cool. Characters are predictable and the setting is interesting enough. But if you’re looking for something of a higher quality caliber, then this show isn’t it. I was strung along the entire show thinking ‘this next episode is going to have more action’ or ‘this time Kaneki is going to do something’. The entire time the show left me with blue balls just waiting for the moment the show would present some sort of meaningful sequence or a badass fight scene. I was sorely disappointed. The final episode had some element of the exploration of morality and choice and it was at a level I was satisfied with, and something I expected to see from the first episode. Yet this wasn’t the case.
But hey, if anything else it was a decent Thursday night filler show. Better than Glasslip that’s for sure. The final episode did have me on edge, even if the characters are 2-dimensional, the execution and presentation of the final episode was able to convey a suspenseful tone which regrettably did not appear in any of the other episodes. I suppose its simply another typical shounen anime.
Overall – 6/10
I’ll admit to enjoying it enough. It wasn’t anything special in the end but it’s a decent show to watch if you’re looking for something to pass the time. If you were expecting any level of depth then you definitely won’t find it here. As explained before, the show had a lot of potential in presenting the different aspects and perspective between ghouls and humans and failed to capitalize. Unfortunately, in the end the show is average at best. It wasn’t the fault of the staff entirely as it could have benefited from more episodes, but the adaptation of the source material was mismanaged. For all its visual style it could not save the show from its muddled storytelling.
This is my first review. Feedback is welcome. A more detailed review can be viewed at my blog!",6
"
                The only thing you'll be left with after watching this series is an extra song in your playlist and a very sour taste in your mouth.
That is, of course, if you manage to wrestle the choppy pacing of eleven episodes of underdeveloped characters that live in the shadow of a wasted premise, beautifully presented through the familliar eyes of the melodramatic queen of a main lead.
Bonus feature: imbecillic censorship. ",3

                No long reviews that take all our god-damned time. 
Those words hit my head when I started this anime.
""It is very strange, this domination of our intellect by our digestive organs. We cannot work, we cannot think, unless our stomach wills so. It dictates to us our emotions, our passions.... We are but the veriest, sorriest slaves of our stomach."" Jerome.K.Jerome
Did you ever think you will be rooting for man eaters in an anime? If no, then Tokyo Ghoul is here to disprove you. Tokyo Ghoul is one of the best anime this season and it is sure to keep you on your toes. With
                  its darkness and gore most likely to attract gore fans but it can be equally enjoyed by anyone.
 Although the concept of getting new powers and meeting a whole different kind of people is not new to anime, but Tokyo Ghoul executes it in a very efficient manner. It focuses on the point that there is no clear distinction between good and evil and it all depends on perspectives. In a deeper sense, it reminds us that we should not jump to conclusions without considering the circumstances and difficulties faced by the others.
The only disappointment is some censoring in a few scenes but it is overshadowed by the awesomeness of this show.Overall a very enjoyable anime, Art is crisp and up-to-date, sound effects and OP/Ending are amazing, characters are unique and interesting.
A must watch for gore and thriller fans.",8

                **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
Tokyo Ghoul can be summed up using the same three points that just about every other overhyped adaptation of an unfinished manga series ends up falling under:
1.	Incomplete (ends dissatisfyingly with almost nothing resolved)
2.	Undeveloped characters (because they were written to have nearly 100x the screen/page time as they ended up having)
3.	Mediocre plot (because it was written to be nearly 100x as long)
In other words, Tokyo Ghoul is a commercial for its manga. Watching it as an anime is almost entirely devoid of purpose (and no, I haven’t read the manga).
Synopsis: In a world where mysterious beings called “ghouls”, people who can eat nothing except
                  human meat, must live along side humans, there is a fierce ongoing war between the two groups. Ken Kaneki, our protagonist, finds himself experiencing ghoul-like urges shortly after an accident, leading him to eventually discover that he has become a half-human half-ghoul.
The premise of Toyko Ghoul is very, very straightforward, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. It’s easy to understand and easy to follow, so therefore it should be able to deliver entertainment easily, right? Well, not so much, and that can be chalked up something I already touched on; incomplete manga adaptations don’t go anywhere. From the beginning to the end, Tokyo Ghoul comically tries to cram an entire manga’s worth of subplots, side characters, and blood/gore into their show all the while attempting to have a coherent plot. Unsurprisingly, this fails. To its credit though, the anime has a great stretch of episodes where it focuses on the similarities between the ghouls and ghoul hunters, demonstrating that they are really quite similar. This makes the show morally grey and adds a significant layer of intrigue to both the plot and the characters. However, it manages to completely contradict and ultimately ruin itself by creating completely one-dimensional, obviously evil, totally unrealistic antagonists. One in particular, a man who calls himself “a gourmet”, is so stupidly over the top and exaggerated that it becomes impossible to take the conflict of the show seriously. It clashes with the stronger aspects of the story and ultimately hurts the narrative. The plot can be suspenseful at times, but it is also a combination of melodrama and a serious lack of direction. The cliché “last second save” plot convenience is nearly an every-other episode occurrence, for example, making the plot even harder to take seriously. Occasionally, it comes across as just cheap violence that’s only edgy for the sake of being edgy. In short, the plot is just overall unrewarding.
The characters, as previously mentioned, show great potential for development. There is a lot of framework set up for most cast members to become tremendously written, dynamic characters. Unfortunately, this is a 12 episode adaptation of an incomplete manga, so none of that development is ever seen. Really, I don’t think anything else needs to be said. There is an undeniable disconnect between the adaptation and the source material due to the incomplete nature of the narrative. At least one entire dimension is missing entirely, and that greatly prevents Tokyo Ghoul from being an enjoyable show. Top that off with the bad written and laughably stupid villains and you get a severely underwhelming group of characters.
To complete circle of disappointment that is Tokyo Ghoul, I give you the animation. Don’t get me wrong; it looks pretty damn good, y’know, when I can actually tell what the hell is going on. There is an absolutely ludicrous amount of the least subtle censorship I’ve ever seen in an anime and it is unbelievably aggravating. Few things grind my gears as much as unnecessary censorship, and it left me with an amazingly sour taste in my mouth. FUCK censorship. Luckily, the music is executed quite nicely and serves to significantly enhance some of the more dramatic scenes, so at least there’s that.
In conclusion, Tokyo Ghoul is the framework of a good story, but it’s just that: a framework. We are never going to see the character development put to animation, we are never going to see the plot lead anywhere noteworthy in animated form, and we are never to going get anything worthwhile out of this series (unless, of course, you read the manga). For that reason, Tokyo Ghoul is a failure of an adaptation. It is a commercial and nothing more. I do not recommend watching it, despite its moments.",5
"
                First review on MAL:
Tokyo Ghoul is a dark fantasy and seinen anime adaptation of the manga made by Ishida Sui, and the TV anime was produced by Studio Pierrot containing 12 episodes. There are also some horror elements, but they aren't that present on the animation.
The main character of the story is Kaneki Ken, an ordinary college student, and his life changes when he meets Rize at the café he frequents with his college friend Hide. Little did he know that she is actually a Ghoul, a carnivorous species only able to feed on humans and even other ghouls too, and during the night, he
                  is attacked and almost got killed and eaten by her. He got saved by an emergency operation, when he got ghouls organs transplanted into his body. 
Basically he became a half-ghoul half-human, or, like many people say, one eyed Ghoul.. then the struggle and the tragedies start for him since he is now inserted into the ghoul world. 
Anyway, how is it? Well, the anime has a promising start in the first episode (usually I would be complaining about the censorship, which is indeed weird, but there are the uncensored episodes available already since a long time already) and at first, as an anime-only watcher or not, you will be looking forward to the storyline, although... Pierrot simply rushed the anime A LOT, skipped so many things and they even changed the order of some events (manga readers know what I mean), which is... really disappointing. 
Also, the studio tried TOO HARD when they made Kaneki expressing his emotions and his struggle while he became a half-ghoul, even though he did some work there, the anime made him look like someone who mostly cries and keeps whining a lot until a certain point, so yeah, he looked like a wimp unfortunately, and there wasn't much development along with the evolution and progress on Kaneki unlike on the manga where these were strong points of his character... his characterization had many problems too. Yes, he suffered a lot with the anime changes on his character.
Not to mention other scenes that they did some weird changes especially on some fights and some censored scenes during the time that the anime was airing, some scenes were so hard to understand to guess what was happening. 
Thankfully the Blu-ray came out on Japan and you can check out the uncensored episodes already since they are available on the internet. 
Now, talking about the animation, you will probably enjoy the quality on it during some fights, even if there are some awkward and sloppy moments on the animation quality like it happens on other animes from studio Pierrot. The kagunes and the quinques were well made though, especially the first one... to be honest, some kagunes (including mainly the Ukaku from Touka) were even beautiful to watch. The animation during the episodes isn't particularly that amazing and the exception happens mostly on the fights or important scenes, so they actually did well on the animation there. 
The story itself is actually pretty interesting and there is a lot of potential on it, and it's nice to see how it shows the perspective from both sides, Ghouls and the humans too, especially on the investigators from the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), it explores characters from both of these sides, which is really interesting, it makes you wonder which side was like the right one and who are the monsters, it makes you wonder a lot about those details, since you will eventually see that not every single Ghoul is evil, and also that the human side also got some bad people, and it gives many possibilities on the storyline but there aren't enough episodes to explore it pretty well, and the studio didn't focus so much on these concepts and ideals involving humans and ghouls, they just jumped into the violent scenes and the action. 
And unfortunately, 12 episodes means that you won't really see a developed plot and character development wasn't the best thing since the story was sooo fast paced and rushed by the studio, and you couldn't really know much about the characters or get attached to them, except for a few ones who got more screen time. 
Also, after the first episode, the events there felt like all over the place sometimes. However, the 2nd half of the first season was more entertaining, especially the last episode.
The original soundtrack and the voices of the characters on the anime are great though (especially on Kaneki, his voice actor did an amazing job, and other characters like Touka, and Tsukiyama too, which made his scene even more hilarious... and weird too). I must admit, they did a pretty good job at the soundtrack aspect of the anime. And yes, the opening song of Tokyo Ghoul, Unravel is so addictive and it fitted perfectly on every aspect with the anime... just like the ending, Seijatachi. Anyway, the music was a good thing on the anime, it did fit pretty well, and OP and ED are pretty catchy. 
As you can see, I made some complaints regarding the anime and its studio ruining some aspects of the adaptation while I tried to not compare too much with the manga (it was inevitable though), but... I must say, it was kind of enjoyable for me when I was new to the series, it had potential like I said, but the feeling that you will get after finishing the first season is that it could have been sooo much better, and there could have been more explanations with many elements of the series like the Kagunes and the RC Cells who were skipped, along with the development of the storyline and the characters... it's like throwing the whole potential away. 
You can clearly notice in the anime that Pierrot didn't pull out so much effort and their budget wasn't really the best (there is a reason why many people had bigger enjoyment with the first and episode 12, since it looked like they invested a lot more on these two episodes) while they made that first season. 
Sometimes even I imagine that Pierrot just wanted to do that shounen treatment at Tokyo Ghoul's anime since they didn't have the best idea in how to make an adaptation. It even felt like an insult or a disrespect towards most of the manga fans/manga readers, since that first season felt like a prototype version of the manga storyline. I do hope that the anime will be remade in the future and do justice to be as great as the manga.
Is the anime enjoyable after all? Well, if you are new to the series, give it a try... you can either love, or see its potential and wonder how it could have been then watch season 2, and check out the manga to see that potential being developed to something amazing, or then hate it due to what the studio did on that adaptation.",7

Story: 7/10
The story starts off with Kaneki, a young high school student who chances upon an encounter with a girl, who turns out to be a ghoul. Both are nearly killed in an accident, that was not really an accident, and Kaneki inherits the girl's internal organs, effectively transforming him into a half-ghoul half-human being. Throughout the anime, Kaneki exemplifies both sides, the ghoul and the human side, and starts to realize how similar they actually are and explore how they can co-exist peacefully.
But not everyone thinks that way. Other ghouls like the gourmets and binge eaters feast on human flesh waay beyond their expected calorie intake, whilst a mysterious group called the Aogiri, led by a one-eyed ghoul, is taking over 11th Ward. The humans, in the form of CCG, are fighting back against the ghouls, using weapons made from ghouls themselves, which they call ""quinque"". Their job is to drive out the ghoul scum from Tokyo.
The plot itself is split into 3 main arcs. The introductory arc focusing on Kaneki's transformation and from human to ghoul and then to a realization that he is half-of-each, the Hinami arc, where both her parents are brutally killed by ""doves"", members of CCG who are hunting the ghouls in 20th ward, as well as the final but incomplete Aogiri arc, where all-out war is imminent between ghouls and humans. All three of such arcs are gripping and have excellent development. (+3)
As far as coherence goes, I can't say much, because the anime ended in a cliffhanger, and it's not entirely fair to point out things that haven't been explained. However, there are a few things that have been explained in a rather unsatisfactory fashion.
Ghouls can't eat human food and puke when they eat food, but can drink coffee, which is perfectly fine. Alright, they also forget to mention that ghouls apparently also can drink water. So the question is this - what's so special about coffee/water - that makes it different from other poisonous human foods? None of this is ever touched on, it's just been assumed for sake of a more touching story of Tohka and her friend giving her food to eat. Next, if Tohka really couldn't eat all that stuff, why didn't she just pretend she was on a diet. Even if her friend would be disappointed, at least as a FRIEND she should understand and respect other people's dietary choices, right?
Next point, Ghouls unleash their powers in a pretty cool fashion, but nowhere does the anime ever touch on where these special powers come from, and why are they so varied? We can see from Hinami that because she inherited her powers from her parents, she has BOTH of their abilities, but what about the others? Wouldn't they have inherited multiple powers as well? Why are so many of them only using one power - since, by assumption, most of them have parents and none of them are ""1st Generation Ghouls"".
That brings me to my next point - the story misses out a key plot line, which I think can really be developed on, the origin of ghouls in the first place. Although this is not so much a problem but an opportunity for further plot development.
Lastly, if ghouls are running rampant everywhere, and could be anyone you know, and the public knows of the existence and general workings of the ghoul (nowhere in the show is it stated or even implicitly shown that the existing of ghouls is a secret), it makes absolutely no sense for the rest of the human public to live life as if nothing is wrong - even with CCG supposedly ""controlling the problem"", because as long as one life has been taken - it would be all over the news and would spread MASSIVE panic and havoc (which is not seen, as of yet). But okay, I contend that the anime did make ""most of the public evacuate from the area"", but that was only in the Aogiri incident, what about all the killings before that in 20th ward? Kids can still go to school and feel safe? No way, man.
The anime still has lots of explaining to do, and has no resolution yet, so I'm hoping the sequel addresses these problems and ties everything up nicely. Still, most of the story is fairly coherent, and inconsistencies don't lie on key plot premises. Characters act naturally based on situations and so do the organisations (except maybe CCG might want to use tanks/aircraft against the ghouls instead of just soldiers) (+1)
As for plot depth, it is definitely quite substantial, because the anime doesn't stick to one main character, Kaneki, and just leave you the whole anime from his perspective. It jumps from the point of view of the CCG, to the people at Anteiku, to the people at Aogiri. All the perspectives are different, but all of them are essentially fighting for their lives or to protect their population/species. The central theme to this anime is basically ""What defines being a human?"" And that question is up to you to decide for yourself. The author hints that being human is essentially just a way of life, and it is our moral compass, conscience and actions that we take that make us human, or not human. (+3)
Like I said, there was no resolution, so I'm rating the story fairly as if I have only watched half the series.
Art: 8/10
The art for this anime is quite good. I love how the powers of the ghouls are fleshed out, all the blood and gore is a bit disturbing, but I guess it suits the anime well. The different character art styles and hair styles are also pretty unique and interesting.
Sound: 6/10
The anime has some quite poor OP and ED themes, but the background music never seems out of place, it was generally alright and kept the excitement going. The voice acting, really top notch here - must've been difficult doing all that screaming. Music was really good for all the touching scenes as well as the action scenes - job well done!
Character: 6/10
The characters in the story are many, but of course, in this 11-episode anime, not all of them can be fleshed out and fully developed. Character development-wise, we got to know the backstories of most of the main cast, Tohka, Kaneki, Nishiki, as the plot progresses, and their pasts tell a lot about why their personalities are the way they are now. There's also quite a lot of dialogue and interaction that goes on between the main characters, and it adds a lot to the identity of the characters. Even Mado and Amon's past and interactions are clearly portrayed throughout the anime, which I thought was a good thing (+2).
The main character in the story is actually quite cliched, but there's still reason to love him because it's the ""good"" kind of cliched, and he doesn't really get that annoying until the last arc where he keeps screaming and starts getting multiple hallucinations. Other than that, you can really feel for Kaneki every time he tried to fight his urge of becoming a ghoul. The character's struggle completely grips you each time. Some people might be slightly annoyed at how useless he is most of the time though, and always needs saving, but this is only present in the first arc, by the second arc his involvement, while still weak, manages to help Tohka defeat Mado, which is a statement to the increasing trend of his usefulness as the anime progresses. (+1)
My favourite character definitely has to be Tohka, even if she is the cliche tsundere in the story. She still ends up kicking ass and has some really beautiful wings, even for tomboy, which she uses to slay people in battle with a rain of red crystals. She's also kind, and slowly opens up to Kaneki, and ends up liking him, as she reciprocates the kindness that Kaneki always shows her, in spite of her cold exterior. She also protects Hinami like her younger sister and has strong affection for her. I also find her really cute, especially the way she blushes and the fact that she wears a rabbit mask. :3 (+1)
The final character who bears some interest is Rize, whom we still know nothing much about (except for the fact that she is a well-read bookworm who shares a similar taste with Kaneki), other than the fact that she is basically the ""ghoul-side"" of Kaneki after merging with his humanity. She haunts him about how it was ""all his fault"" and about how he has to ""suffer"" because he refuses to hurt other people, and about how his ""inability/powerlessness in making decisions/taking action"" result in the various tragedies surrounding him. She eventually convinces him that in order to ""protect something"" he must ""sacrifice something else in return"", which Kaneki eventually concludes that he has to sacrifice his own sense of ""humanity"" and become a monster to attain the power he needs to protect the people whom he cherishes. (+1)
Rize's character continues to be mysterious, but her influence in the anime seems much greater than many of the other supporting cast that the anime introduced and then totally left them out of any form of development.
None of the other characters actually stand out much because they aren't focused on too much. Yamori is one of the evil bad guys who goes crazy for no apparent reason and begins torturing Kaneki, for no other reason than, ""Hey guys I got tortured, so I think I should torture him too."" Which is like...uhh bad reason yo. Also known as ""Jason"", he is the main antagonist in this 12-episode run, but he doesn't get much a back story and gets even less of development despite his central role in the anime, so that was disappointing.
In terms of character growth, Kaneki shows outstanding growth throughout this anime - from being a wimpy kid at first, to growing slightly stronger but still being generally weak, to end up going crazy because of Rize that is in him and accepting his ghoul-ness despite his best efforts in being human, because he realizes being human ain't gonna help him save his ghoul friends anymore, and he is too powerless as a human. (+1)
Tohka also shows a bit of growth, slowly opening out of her shell. While Hinami goes from simply crying and whining about her tragic life, which is truly sad, to growing stronger than she is expected to, and volunteering to fight to get Kaneki back at Anteiku. The other one who shows growth is Amon, who starts to wonder about whether ghouls are all that bad at all when he meets Kaneki, who spares his life and does something only humans would do. Amon also gives into the desire for revenge against the ""Rabbit"" Tohka-chan, for taking away his boss, Mado, whom he respected and looked up to a whole lot. But none of these are actually portrayed well enough, we can see the change in the characters but the progression to that state, not so.
Tohka's growth came while ""sitting idly by"" and ""reflecting about stuff that happened"", all of which was essentially skipped, and we only know this because Kaneki bothered to see her in her room. Hinami's growth came in the midst of her crying... it really does solve everything doesn't it? Amon's growth came from visiting Mado's grave. But the anime showed little or none about what led him to any of these characters' conclusion.
The anime also left me with some characters whom I'd really be interested to know about, like the old dude who leads Anteiku, Yomo, and of course the girl at the bar, Itori, because their character exudes some sort of special aura about them. Too bad they weren't fleshed out in this series.
Enjoyment: 9/10
I really enjoyed most of this anime, from beginning all the way until the final arc. The scenes are action-packed, and when they are not full of heart-racing action, they are full of touching scenes of people crying, screaming, and talking to each other in meaningful moral dialogue. This anime I didn't want to put down from the time I started, till the time I ended, so good job for that. I did think that the entire of episodes 11 and 12 focused too much on the torture that Kaneki was going through. Firstly because the torture made no sense whatsoever anyway, and secondly because it just felt soooo long. Too long, in fact, and while it first gripped me, I slowly lost interest because it was the same screaming over and over again, and it was the same blood over and over again.
So, I can't give full points for enjoyment but it's still a very exciting anime to watch.

                I REALLY almost desperately wanted to like this anime, but it failed me and went off the rails like a possessed train.
I’m sorry, to all Tokyo Ghoul fans, I really am. I had such high hopes for this show, but, it had so, so many issues. So, lets get down to it.
This post is spoiler free! :D 
Characters: 3/10
The show started with a bang. In the first two episodes, I was ready to adopt Kaneki as one of “my precious babies”. Then show unraveled like cheap sweater.  While Kaneki remained interesting, his emotional development got lost in the rather vast world of ghouls.
                  Kaneki became background noise battered like a pin-pong ball between the too-fast plot and integration into the ghoul society. It's a shame too. Kaneki could’ve become one of my favorite characters (I still plan on reading the manga despite the anime so it could happen!).
Kaneki aside, I (in all honesty) can’t recall the name of a single character (I looked them up for this review) aside from Hide, who barely appears. I had a difficult time caring about anyone, especially the ghouls. Let me explain why the ghouls mostly sucked (for me). 
First, I’m supposed to believe the characters live in a dystopian society, yet none of them (excluding Renji and Yoshimura) behave as if they do. Most characters have angst oozing out their pores, but, if ghouls live in such a crappy culture, how come none of the characters seem to realize it before the anime? For example, one character (who will remain nameless for spoilers sake), literally sits in [his/her] room for THREE days (or longer, not sure) because someone called [his/her] “ghoul power” beautiful. Seriously? If I’m supposed to believe [he/she]’s is someone who grew up in a world this grating, why does something so small make [him/her] mope for three days? [He/she] is allowed to be upset, but honestly. If this character lived in such a war-torn and desperate society, a compliment shouldn't shatter [he/she]. 
If you’re thinking I missed the point and that [he/she]’s reaction to a compliment should help me understand how hard the world is, I disagree. Watch Berserk, Attack on Titan, or Akira. Those characters live in a terrible world and act like it (note: I’m not saying every character in a dystopian society or situation needs to be angry and miserable, take Allen Walker, for example).
I have another beef with this compliment drama—a human complimented the ghoul. This character’s relation to humans befuddled me. First, [he/she] acts as if humans are beneath [him/her]. Then, suddenly, the character has a valued human friend and a compliment from a human that [he/she] had such contempt for before make [him/her] pout for three days. I did not understand that whiplash.  
This character isn’t the only one filled with hypocrisy. Another character (for the sake of spoilers I’ll have to be vague here) acts badly towards a human and shows [him/herself] to consider humans nothing but a food source and then—suddenly—is in love with one! It made no sense whatsoever to me. 
Several characters did some bewilderingly stupid things. Instead of feeling sorry for them, I could only blink at the sheer stupidity of their actions. 
Lastly, many characters have rapidly changing opinions. They’ll yell and berate or even attack in each other in one episode and--bam! They are desperate to save and protect each other for no real reason in the next. Again emotional development is sacrificed for plot. 
Story: 4/10
The story moved too fast, plain and simple. I understood it, but I just didn’t give a two figs. Every other episode spent the first five minutes (after intro and recap) telling the viewer what happened since the last episode ended and the first began (in other words, most episode have huge plot developments and time jumps between each one). This made it extremely difficult to invest myself in the story.
As I said before, new aspects of the world kept cropping up like jack-in-the-boxes. Unfortunately, most of those elements vanished. The world didn’t feel well-rounded, more like someone puked out a bunch of interesting ideas without considering how it all meshed together (I kid you not, someone ends up having a brother the viewer knew almost nothing (if anything, I can’t remember) about that shows up around episode 10 or so. And I was supposed to care about this new sibling relationship (hint: I didn’t)). Most of the world’s elements fit the story’s tone, but there was one bizarre arc that felt like it belonged in Pandora Hearts, Black Butler, or D.Gray-man. I enjoy all three of those, but such a tone certainly didn’t fit Tokyo Ghoul.
The show is also chuck full of clichés. I know some people will give me heat for saying this, but it’s just true. I’ve seen all of those plot elements numerous times. 
Another big problem of this story: I was supposed to care about the ghouls. Um, how? None of the ghouls seemed to like humans; most of them seemed to hate humans, have contempt for them, or blame them for how tough I’m supposed to believe their life is.  But I didn’t pity the ghouls. They eat people without much remorse, for the most part anyways. I can sympathize with a bad guy; I can sympathize with non-human characters; but I found myself struggling to even view the ghouls as the good guys. 
Another problem: I’m supposed to believe (minor spoiler) that one of the reasons this world is so tough and rough is because ghouls and humans can’t co-exist. But the only thing standing in their way was anger. No one seemed willing to give an inch and even try to understand each other (say Kaneki, for obvious reasons). In the end, I found them all stupid.
The plot moved faster than the Shinkansen, which through pacing, investing me in the story, and developing characters out the window. It seemed the anime aimed for big and shocking moments to show people how awesome and fast-paced it was. While it obviously worked--the show is popular, after all--it didn’t work for me. I didn’t care about the “shocking” moments because I couldn’t care less about what was happening. 
Art (and cinematography in general): 10/10
Here the show shined. Beautiful animation that made fights look like brutal yet elegant. Total eye candy.  
(music): It added to the show but wasn’t particularly amazing. 
(angles): They did a fairly standard job here. 
(intro/outro): I loved both, and the intro’s animation was creative and stunning.
Fan service: 1/10
The show did not have up-skirt shots or laughably big-chested girls. Someone did fight mini skirt, but the female lead usually wore pants (shock). Here, the show did a pretty fantastic job.
Sub vs Dub: 
Watched it in sub and thought it was pretty good. It hasn't been dubbed. 
Warnings: 
The show has a few plot holes. No matter how I racked my brain, I simply could not figure out the problem’s resolution. 
That being said, Tokyo Ghoul is beloved. My opinion isn’t a popular one. In fact, I think its reputation set my expectations too high (so did those first two episodes). Anyways, I plan on reading the manga, which could change my opinion on the anime. 
Overall: 5/10",5

                Please tell me, what is the monster inside of me?
Tokyo Ghoul is a dark action supernatural manga adaptation of the same name. It was one of the more hyped anime for the 2014 Summer season, due to the success of the manga and the proposed themes. It is an another take on the survival sub-genre, one that is really popular nowadays in the West, however fails to have a clear direction of where it wants to go with it.
Plot: 
After a ghoul - monster that has superpowers and devour humans for living - attack, Ken Kaneki overgoes a surgery that makes him a half-ghoul, half-human
                  creature with one red eye. He must become accustomed to the new world he's thrown in, as the tensions in 20th Ward arise with increased ghoul and dove - ghoul investigator - activity.
The plot is pretty basic and simple but the premise looks really promising and you expect it would deliver a thrilling experience on what it takes to be a ghoul and how to survive in the cruel world. And that's where it ends. Soon enough it turns out to be a ghoul gang turf beef anime where the ""good"" and the ""bad"" ghouls fight each other for territory while the ""police"", the doves, try to eliminate them, and it starts playing out as a shonen.
The psychological aspect of the show, after the first three episodes, quickly becomes forgotten. Kaneki's demised encounter is made to be just an excuse to introduce us to the ghoul world, so much that he almost acts as a plot device. The anime tries waaay too much at the same time, introducing plot devices and characters that hardly get any explanation at all. They desperately wanted to include everything in the show, focusing on nothing specifically and ending incomplete. There's no direction, hardly any foreshadowing, and everything is just a big mess. There are a couple of distinguishable arcs but but they overlap each other and don't seem to have any significant importance. The ghouls are made to be either ""good"" or ""bad"", the good ones being ones that don't kill people but instead eat the already dead ones, and bad ones being those who kill for fun, and are just made to be bad so the characters could disagree and hate them and spark up conflicts. It could have been an interesting ideology and morality clash between sides but yet again, the series fail to flesh out the aspect.
Characters:
Tokyo Ghoul is one of the rare anime that I would safely tell that the main character is the best one. Ken Kaneki, the protagonist, is just your everyday student, and then everything changes when the ghoul nation attacks. He is dubbed a half-human, half-ghoul creature, and acts sort of a bridge between two worlds. Sadly, that aspect is not focused on, and he doesn't seem to have much importance in the story as he's just a throw-in piece to get the audience accustomed to what is going on. What is good about him though is that he develops a pseudo-double personality, with Rize, the eccentric ghoul that tried to kill him but died instead and got her organs replaced with Ken's, acting as the ghoul part of him, and Ken acting as the human part. The double-personality part is really well done, but didn't receive enough time.
Then we have your obligatory cliched characters that you'll quickly forget: Touka, the female interest and a pseudo-tsundere that has the most development out of the rest of the cast, but otherwise unimportant; Amon, a dove that acts as a representative for the rest of the investigator squad and is the only other character that receives significant development, when his motives for killing ghouls and the view on ghouls are questioned; Mado, a one dimensional villain dove that kills ghouls because he thinks they must be eliminated; and a ton of other insignificant one-dimensional characters or villains that are just there to catalyze the story forward.
In all honesty, the side cast of Tokyo Ghoul is the worst part of the show. There are maybe 2-3 characters that are important to the story at most, the rest are completely irrelevant, in addition to being one dimensional. The bad ghouls are all made to be sadists: there's absolutely no variety between them, and no backdrop as to why they are like that. Meanwhile, the good guys only show up to infodump you or to save the protagonists, and have no personalities of their own. Tragedy is an important part of the themes and the story and it is quite frequent in the anime but it is really hard to care for characters you barely know about.
Writing:
I wouldn't say that Tokyo Ghoul has bad writing but it's certainly below average. There are plenty of inconsistencies and jumps in story telling, and quite a few things that don't make sense at all. For the first couple of episodes where the anime was still slow, writing was decent, but they dropped the ball the moment the gladiator show was introduced. There is no ground level perspective presented: even though the main character is a representative of both human and ghoul societies, we are not given any idea on how ordinary humans feel about being killed everyday by superior species. It plays out as just a normal and obvious thing and no one seems to worry much about ghouls' existence.
Since the story is focused on so much and yet on nothing, lots of interesting plot devices left unexplained and you only know about how they work based on assumptions. For example, Quinques, the weapons that ghoul investigators use, are supposedly from Kagune, a ghoul's organ that acts as a superpower, but it's not explained on how they are able to use them, how exactly do they get them or why. The ghoul's nature is hardly explained as well, resorting to a simple ""they need human flesh to survive"" explanation, even though their Kagune is a very cool and interesting superpower. The limits to said superpowers and varieties are not mentioned.
As for the genres and atmosphere, Tokyo Ghoul manages to create tension rather successfully - it doesn't have shameless fanservice or stupid comedy just for the sake of it, and tries its best to deliver the message (again problem being that there's just far too many messages to be delivered). There's not so much of a mystery though, since there is no foreshadowing and lots of things are introduced on the bat that you have to care about or you won't be able to understand what's going on, therefore there's not many expectations that some big revelations are about to show up later on.
Animation and sound:
There was a huge hiatus going on when the show aired regarding its massive censors on gore. Yes, that was actually a big thing. The censors killed a lot of fun, and it was a mandatory for a dark, almost horror anime to have excessive gore, because there were more than enough reasons to have them. It's not like the gore happened off screen - it was blurred out with black or even worse - changing the color palette to full green whenever a gruesome fight scene occured when it was impossible to just blur our the gore. I thought a lot about how much gore was needed for this anime and how much should we care that it was presented this way, but from a storytelling point of view it's not too much of a worry since you definitely know that gory stuff is going on, you just don't see them.
The animation itself during fights is well done, especially in the final episode. Character designs are made to look really emo, which coincidentally plays out to the advantage of the dark atmosphere. The voice acting is decent, with Miyano Mamoru pulling off an exceptional performance voicing the gourmet ghoul. The music is pretty okay, no stand out pieces but they do fit in the situation. All in all, apart from the censors, art and sound don't have anything wrong in them.
About the opening and ending, the ED is very basic and generic with a couple of still-frames of the characters changing while the song plays. However, the OP is currently the best of the year - it has AMAZING animation and exceptional music, and does everything that a good OP should do - mirror the atmosphere of the anime and foreshadow the characters. It is more emotional than the anime itself, and I definitely recommend to check it out.
Summary: 
Tokyo Ghoul draws many comparisons to Deadman Wonderland, but it's much better in execution (that's not saying much though). It has a lot of interesting ideas but there's none that are given enough focus. The manga fans are screaming that the adaptation ruined the franchise, as the original material is actually very slow compared to the ""too fast"" anime version. It should have had atleast a dozen episodes more to avoid being so rushed. This again proves why 2 cour anime are usually superior to 1 cour.
Even so, it still was one of my favourite anime of the season, because tastes, and not because it was objectively good (because it was not). If you like survival genre, or dark settings in general, you could check this out, although don't expect much.
Final Verdict - 4.6/10",5
"
                First of all, just so you know, I have not written many reviews. Ever. Of anything. Also, I realise that in comparison to many other reviewers I'm like a newbie, seeing as I have only watched about 20 animes and have just (since a few months) started reading manga. 
Also, while scrolling down numerous reviews I noticed a very distinct pattern: the reviewers who first read the manga and those who either haven't, or just started reading it. Those who read the manga seem to give the show a very low score while those who haven't seem to give it an absurd high score.
Now, I've
                  read the manga after watching the anime so I guess my score will be something inbetween.

I would like to give it a 7,5 but since that not possible I'll stick with 8. The story itself is very interesting, while at first glance it looks like your typical horror/supernatural anime with 'bad guys', ghouls who eat humans and the humans themselves, who are obviously the ""good guys"". However the story shows both sides, the human side, firstly via Kaneki but later on via Amon, and the Ghoul side via numerous ghouls that Kaneki meets. It explores grey areas of both species and forces you to ask the question: ""Who are the monsters?"" A very interesting story with so many possibilities had it not been so rushed and jumbled up. In the first few episodes it follow the manga fairly well but then it starts to diverge. Now everyone should probably realise by now that an anime that follows its manga to the letter is rare if not inexistent. However I think the anime made a mistake by not following the manga more closely, it made everything seem too rushed. Not fully recovered from the previous arc it throws you into another one without warning. Also something, that apperantly many reviwers dislike, is the ending. To me, personally it seems like a good ending, be it a bit rushed and sudden it definetly makes you yearn for more. which is after all, it's purpose I think.
Art 7/10
As someone who values the art as something that must be either perfect or close to it Tokyo Ghoul wasn't a total disappointment but doesn't fit the criteria either. I do love the fact that they coloured the kagune differently than it's done in the manga, mostly because its colour reflects its user very well. Red would have done it too ofcourse but the change of colour is a nice touch. But then they added the censoring: piece of advice: please watch the uncensored verison (unless you really can't stand blood). The censoring was bothersome and unnecessary, maybe even plain on ridiculous.
Sound 8/10
During the episodes I did not really pay cose attention to the sound or music on the background, mostly because I was too busy following the story (so technically, that's a good thing) but what I can say is that the OS could not have been better or more fitting.
Then there is also the voice casting. Personally I think they did a very good job, the voice casting really matches the characters and the voice actors did a really good job.
Character 6/10
The characters themselves are very interesting and very promising, none of them are boring and for once there was not one character that I wished would just die (very rare for me). However, because of the rushing and the fact that they sqeezed, like 60 chapters into 12 episodes they do not get the attention or development they truly deserve and desperately need. They are easily seen as unimportant and merely stepping stones for the plotline or the development of other characters. Especially Kaneki Ken who only gets his develompent (or personality description) in the last few episodes and remains weak until the final episode, which was actually quite bothersome, even more so because he is the protagonist. And knowing that even the protagonist gets close to no development at all you can probably guess how much development the side characters get.
Enjoyment 9/10
The reason I enjoyed it so much must be because I hadn't read the manga at the time seeing as everyone who did seems to either dislike it or plain on hate it. Besides a few issues here and there the anime did a good job and attracted quite a lot of attention as one of the most popular anime's in it's season. And seeing as after I watched I could not get enough of Tokyo Ghoul and started reading the manga and it's sequel and spin-offs etc. I think it's fair to say: job well done!
Overall 7/10
It's a good anime and that's that, I understand that there are a lot of people who've read the manga first that are disatisfied but I am not one of them. I look forward to the next season but I do hope that they will stick closer to the manga than they did in its first. I would recommend you try watching the anime because it's definitely worth your time and I also recommend reading the manga which is really amazing and feels less rushed. Also the manga is not censored (thank god)",7

                OK I had to write this review as all I saw on this page was a load of reviews with really low scores which is bizarre as this anime is actually really good.
Some people claim that this anime is a bad adaptation of the manga which I completely disagree with. While this is not a perfect adaptation and some scenes have been changed around I do not think that this makes this Anime bad in any way. It is more like a slightly different take on the story which is still very good in its own right. 
Having read the manga the manga and the
                  anime are for the most part the same. There are some scenes in the anime which have been rearranged and a few smaller scenes that have been cut most likely due to restraints of the 12 episode anime format, but overall it is very close to the manga and does a great job of adapting all of the main scenes.
I will say that Kaneki's character is presented slightly differently in the Anime as opposed to the Manga though. In the Manga he does come across as being more competent and heroic due to the slight change of a couple of key scenes and the omission of another quite major scene in the last arc. So I recommend that people check out the Manga as well to see this difference. 
I wouldn't say that this spoils the Anime though it actually made more sympathetic towards him in a way, so it is a different take on his character similar to the original Evangelion series and the rebuild movies. Kaneki is a bit more passive and reactive in the Anime as opposed to being more of a proactive competent protagonist in the Manga.  
If you don't like the more sensitive reactive kind of protagonists then you may dislike the main character in this Anime. I love those kind of characters though so its a matter of taste. 
This anime kept me on the edge of my seat and it was very addictive and I couldn't wait for the next episode. The main themes of humans and ghouls trying to coexist and the complications emerging from this were well explored in the story and character interactions. The story goes into a lot of detail in fleshing out the setting to show the different perspectives of the ghoul and human characters. The picture painted is not a black and white good vs evil story but a multi layered one with different shades of grey. You will sympathise with both human and ghoul characters and also despise some of the human and ghoul characters, so the anime does a good job of getting you emotionally involved with the story. 
The production values of the anime are overall very good with some awesome battle scenes and great music and sound effects. Special note must be made of the voice acting which especially for the main character really stood out as being exceptionally good. 
This is probably the bloodiest anime I've seen and the attention detail in the fight scenes and blood and gore really was spectacular. You do really need to watch the uncensored version of this Anime. I feel it is unfair how people have marked this Anime down due to the censorship of the TV version because the Uncensored version of this Anime really does do the Manga justice in the level of gore. It is actually more gory than the Manga in certain parts with one new added scene in particular that really was very disturbing and very well executed. 
The are a couple of standout scenes in this anime which really got to me emotionally, the pacing was very good to lead up to these events and they made this anime really memorable.
One particular episode is up there with the best I've ever seen in anime so I highly recommend this anime to everyone.
Tokyo Ghoul really was an intense and unforgettable experience.",10

                WTF kind of anime that I just watched?
That's my reaction after watching the last episode and according to the forum commentators, it was pretty much rushed and they were certainly right. I guess you might said that some manga would have better be left as mangas than be adapted as an anime...that is, if studios such as studio Pierrot won't do it right, so I'm gonna keep my review of this anime simple as I present my ratings for each of this anime's category:
Pathetic 1. 
Story- it was basically another one of those plot where the protagonist become somewhat of a........let's just say being able
                  to get intertwine in the middle of two worlds in this case Kaneki being a half ghoul and a half human. What makes it pathetic was how he get to be one, where he almost becomes a monster's snack if not for some weird accident that befalls the monster where she get's killed (where the scenario for the lady ghoul was too stupid to say the least) and the victim (Kaneki) become a victim of the doctor's malpractice where he get's organ transplant from his attacker. Now, this is the part where I would ask as to wtf was this series writer thinking Sui Ishida for coming up with such dorky concept as how Kaneki become a half human/ half ghoul kind of thing? If I were Sui Ishida I probably make Kaneki as some sort of lab experiment that got away, that would have have been cool than some scenario that is too stupid.
Overall- because it was rushed, it was pretty obvious that studio Pierrot should have extended it up to 20 episode, also we should have seen as to how Amon's rematch with Toka had transpired. Since the anime ended in a sour note, I wouldn't be surprise if the manga only run for about 13 volumes, pretty obvious that the whole series whether it's a manga or anime was more like gore porn than anything else.   
Good 7.
Art- what can I say I love the blood and gore that see in this anime and that's that.
Poor 3.
I don't like the opening and the closing theme, I don't like Kaneki's pussy voice, expect of course for Mado, I like the way that he voice out his pleasure of killing ghouls.
Dreadful 2.
Character- the reason why I gave it such rating was basically the way on how they were double standardize, now Nishiki Nishio and  Shū Tsukiyama where suppose to be dead and yet we still see them alive and kicking. Now, if them ghouls can't be killed then Rize Kamishiro should still be alive and them Doves would have been exterminated easily by them ghouls, also how the fuck did a half ghoul like Kaneki become a super ghoul after being tortured by Yakumo? Now he's a half ghoul right? So he should have some form of limitation, so how come he doesn't? I'm guessing that since he is the main protagonist he should come on top which it would be such a pathetic idea coming from series writer Sui Ishida. Now, the only characters that I see whose roles were right are Toka, Mado, Amon and Hinami.
Decent 4.
Enjoyment- Well it was a bit enjoyable from episode 1 to 11, but the last one was shit all the way, I didn't even get to see Amon's duel with Toka which was a bit disappointing.",1

                ""Some things are better left unsaid""
I dont' know why, but this quote is implemented into the story of Tokyo Ghoul, literally and practically. I will go in-depth towards this perspective throughout the review but keep in mind I will keep this review short and precise so that you readers can make a choice of either to prioritize this anime over others or to not..
I also will not include a synopsis in this review, because the description of this anime is written on the anime page.
Opinion:
Tokyo Ghoul is far more superior than other anime in that it has a solid story and presented it well within
                  the two episodes. We get the feeling as if, the main character (Kaneki) is going to turn out like the typical bad ass character. I feel that Kaneki didn't have enough background information and who his mother is. As to the quote I have mentioned above; the quote is said throughout the anime couple of times and you get the image that Tokyo Ghouls creator has lived life that way. I may sound kiddish hear but wait until you watch the anime. 
So let's get into the specifics here shall we?
[""What are ghouls?""
""Why can't ghouls taste human food the same as humans do?""
""What is CCG?""
""What the hell is a Quinque""
""What is with all the wards and fight between Humans and Ghouls?""]
Tokyo Ghoul fails to answer these questions and seems to think the audience will just pick up the answer throughout the show. Nothing important gets background information. The whole concept of Ghouls and their nature and society hasn't been given any screen time and I feel that is what Tokyo Ghoul needed in order to properly build up the climax and plot in order for us audiences to completely be satisfied with the ending. What Tokyo Ghoul needs is a proper background detail of what each and everything is so that we can understand and build emotions to characters. Throughout watching the anime, I didn't get to feel a emotional attachment throughout the characters or even Ghouls; who are supposed to be badass and cool. They didn't have the character development in order to feel that way, and this is what Tokyo Ghoul did wrong. Now I understand, its a 12 ep anime. But I believe they haven't used that 12 ep wisely and just quickly proceeded through the story without having and logic. Now all of this doesn't make this show necessarily a ""bad"" show.  It does have very intriguing action fights which appear from time to time though are very small due to lack of time.
I will now go into the real review containing:
Story|Character|Setting|Animation|Sound|Personal Enjoyment|
~Story~
The story of Tokyo Ghoul was similar to Parasyte the Maxim who some of you may call Kiseijuu. A protagonist human being invaded by a non-human creature. But in Tokyo Ghoul, it was more of a decision in order to keep Kaneki alive. The story line does pick up well through the end of the anime where all characters are revealed and shown. I think Tokyo Ghoul is far advantageous because the story it has is of it's own kind other than the one similarity of Kiseijuu.  The only problem is that it wasn't delivered quite precisely.
~Character~
Where the show really doesn't shine is Characters. Not even a tiny bit of screen time for any side characters except if the main character is in the setting. None of the characters have any background details of them and there was no emotional attachment to the characters if one of them end up dying.
~Setting~
Not much to say in this field, except that everything in the setting perspective what though out well. All ghouls in one area (Anteiku) and humans were seperated. It was managed well and there wasn't any problems with switching settings.
~Animation~
Really well done. I loved how they made the uncensored version of this  
anime because it really does give more feelings to this anime. This section is for sure where Tokyo Ghoul excels. Blood and Gore were a part of this anime so if you're a fan of that, you should check this out.
~Sound~
The opening of this Anime is one of the better ones and believe it or not, I still get goosebumps when Kaneki's hair is flying in the beginning. The ending wasn't too great but that may be because I didn't take time out to actually hear it. The overall sound in this anime isn't something I critiqued often but as far as I remember, it was suitable to the situation and setting so you could say it was well done.
~Personal Enjoyment~
I liked this anime, and some of you may think I don't; but to make reviews, you must look at the anime from a different perspective and pinpoint small flaws and details that could have altered the anime from being different than how it is. I feel Tokyo Ghoul had great potential if they had used their time thinking out each character and took more time to build up the process of Kaneki being a stronger hybrid.
I know this review may have seemed like a rant at the beginning, but I had to let out how I felt after watching this anime, and hopefully you can make a decision to watch this anime or not, or to agree with what I have just said.
Thanks for reading!",7

                (This is my 1st review)
I was looking forward to this show because friends told me how good the manga is & how excited they were about it getting an anime. Tbh I wasn't expecting that much from it but entertainment. Didn't think it would be the anime of the season but still a cool thing to watch !
Story: It starts off with that guy getting mixed blood with a ghoul & becoming some kind of half human / half ghoul dude. That part was ok I guess, you kinda think ghouls are gonna be scary etc since they eat humans. But like every ghoul is
                  some kind of emoteen... almost feels like the author thought only gothics could fit the role. 
To be fair I really didn't pay much attention to the story since it was so confusing. Not like complicated or anything but just borrinnnnggg as hell.. 
Art: I guess it well animated, I just don't really like the design it's so shonen & basic.. I guess the manga is like that too but it can be fine in animes with an actual PLOT. The art is the best part of the anime though
Sound: Wow! Not gonna hate but you really gotta be into that anime opening J-HARD ROCK/METAL kinda music which I really don't feel. It really deserves the DREADFUL 2 I gave it
Character: I guess some are bearable, the MC is a whining bitch, dude can't get over being a ghoul. PFFF... I hate that kinda character, just slowing the pace of the story/action bc he keeps whining. If they actually put content every time he was crying the anime would've been a lot better.
Most the bad guys are crazy dudes on LSD / good guys are emos or just regular people.
Enjoyment: Can't hate on the action scenes & the art which are the only things making this anime somewhat relevant & watchable.
The story made no sense, the characters had no depth, the sound was terrible.
Boring show overall, I don't recommend",4
"
                I'm gonna keep this straight up and simple,
This is an anime that you've already seen, a story in which you already know, characters who you already know, and an ending you'd pretty much expect.
Tokyo Ghoul at first had my expectation and interest at a completely maximum level, and the first episode totally delivered that to me, I was sucked into the series and wanted to see more and more of it, BUT after I had begun to watch the second episode and so on, the story and its characters had begun to take a completely cliche' and predictable turn, with a completely unsatisfied ending.
All in
                  all, Ghoul is basically a clone of a lot of other anime series, Main character suddenly gets or is forced with powers or special abilities, then is suddenly stuck between 2 worlds unable to live a normal life ever again, then has sympathy for both opposing sides, then suddenly becomes over powered out of nowhere when  that power is needed. 
I'd recommend this anime, if you like senseless violence and gore. Nothing special or unique about the story.",5
"
                overview:
Everyone has been saying how Tokyo Ghoul: 2 was a piece of shit, but the first Tokyo Ghoul was a masterpiece. I have a revelation to share with the denizens of MAL. The first Tokyo Ghoul...actually wasn't very good. I'm going to depart from my normal format in order to try something new for me. I will divide the review largely into positives vs. negatives.
Some Spoilers!
Background: 
Sometimes a popular trend can go completely out of control and the media becomes hyper-saturated with a particular style or genre. For most people on MAL and 4chan, that evil that must be stomped out is ""Moe"" anime and
                  slice of life shows. For me, it is fucking zombie and vampire media. I feel it has degenerated to a pathetic level that is tiresome, redundant, and as brainless as a zombie itself. I also feel that vampires have been absolutely raped by the likes of Twilight and other bullshit copycats. Tokyo Ghoul isn't Twilight caliber bad, but it IS absurdly overhyped simply because it followed a popular fad. Although ghoul is usually synonymous with zombie, the ghouls in Tokyo Ghoul actually share far more in common with traditional vampires. They are a completely different species that have a human appearance and human intelligence, but can only feed on human flesh and are sickened by other types of food. However, the ""Ghouls"" don't have typical vampire weaknesses and lack most of the powers associated with vampires. Tokyo Ghoul at its core, is a show about the struggle between humanity and the Ghouls, with the main character Ken being a ghoul that fights other ghouls.
Positives: 
1. The art is actually quite good. The character designs, animation, and gore are all genuinely well done.
2. The music is not bad, considering it was the composer's first soundtrack and the guy is younger than I am. Even though I'm beginning to grow tired of ominous Latin chanting for EVERY ACTION SCENE EVER! Too bad Carl Orff is dead. I would like to see his reaction to today's soundtracks and ask him if he regrets ever writing Carmina Burana.
3. While it could have done more to build up its world and try re-invent rather than copy other vampire/zombie media, it does offer a few interesting, relatively fresh elements. The main character himself being a badass anti-hero ghoul that fights other ghouls is...sort of interesting. Although considering the ghouls are basically vampires and not zombies, we have seen this before in: Hellsing, Blade, Skyrim, Vampire Hunter D, etc. The ghouls have powers that aren't typically associated with zombies or vampires, which gives us something new to look at. The fact that the vampires fully eat their victims and 1 vampire can eat 11 people or just over 1,000 pounds of flesh in a couple days is...interesting I guess. In most media the undead don't typically have a really high metabolism since they don't generate body heat and lack heartbeats. Cold blooded animals typically need to eat WAY less often than warm blooded animals. At least the show didn't make us watch purple hair moe vampire chick take a several hundred pound dump! That would make this show suck even more than it already does.
4. LOTS of nudity and blood. For some people, that could be a positive.
Negatives:
1. This series is tagged as horror, yet it completely fails as a horror series. It doesn't have ANY concept of how to build tension or create a creepy atmosphere. It just throws gore in your face. The music isn't suitably creepy. Even 11 year olds wouldn't be afraid of this shit!
2. The plot and characters really aren't that good. It is a cheesy, poorly written drama that gets away with the same stuff other series get crucified for, because vampires and zombies are ""Cool""! Weak characterization, plot convenient amnesia, and poor dialogue are just a sample of the things that Tokyo Ghoul has basically gotten a ""free pass"" on. While it offers a few elements that haven't been done to death, it falls FAR short of the works that actually made a massive impact on the undead horror genre. For example, ""Let the Right One In"" was able to keep vampires as vicious predators, but actually attempted to make the audience feel sympathy for them. It also contained a rather immoral and delightfully dark romance that was basically the anti-Twilight. Attack on Titan took the concept of brainless, stumbling creatures that were once human and live off human flesh, overrunning the human population and driving mankind to the brink of extinction along with all the other zombie apocalypse survival elements, but changed it just enough that most fans don't even realize it IS just another zombie apocalypse show. I don't actually like Attack on Titan, but changing the zombies into retarded giants was kind of a masterstroke of popular fiction writing. It didn't really change anything, but changed the surface texture just enough to trick people into thinking it was something new. By contrast, I don't really have any strong compliments I can give Tokyo Ghoul for its writing.
3. Entertainment is of course a highly subjective category, but I really didn't derive any pleasure at all out of this one. The bloody action didn't really move me, the plot was garbage, the characters are garbage, and it didn't offer anything I really wanted to see. Half the time this series was like reading an old 4chan ""green text"" fanfiction before all the really nasty motherfuckers left to form 4chan's bastard offspring Gurochan. I laughed at horrible fanfiction about hot chicks eating hundreds of pounds of human flesh back in the early 2000s! I don't need to spend 6 hours of my life watching it on the big screen! 
TLDR:
Tokyo Ghoul wasn't really much better than its shitty sequel. It was an over-hyped, mediocre at best series that largely escaped negative criticism by riding the popularity of undead horror media. This series was a complete and utter waste of time and animation budget.",4
"
                Oh god this show is impossibly difficult.
On one hand, it was actually pretty badass. I mean the concept itself is something very appealing to many fans in general, and the manga was already quite well received. But then, once you actually watch the show, all the hype turns into...confusion. Well here it goes, Tokyo Ghoul:
The show revolves around Kaneki Ken, an introvert who spends all his free time engrossed in literature. By the miraculous hands of the anime gods, he ends up on a date with Kana Hanaz- I mean Kamishiro Rize, a purple haired beauty with the same tastes as him regarding novels and
                  books. A few plot points later, and our friend Kaneki turns into a ghoul. Now, ghouls are a huge problem in Japan. They essentially live off of eating humans, and they are hunted by various police investigators, known as “Doves,” who aim to end the ghoul threat once and for all. Now this sounds pretty interesting, and at some points during the show, it genuinely is. For a majority of the show, the issue between the ghouls and doves is a point of high contention, as well as the moral boundaries of the ghouls themselves. Other characters include Kirishima Touka, the other purple haired beauty (ha) that acts as Kaneki's superior in a way, and a varied secondary cast that is really not worth mentioning. This leads me into the main issue with the show.
The characterization and characters themselves are what drive this show to the ground. Honestly, nobody really gets fleshed out during the period of the show. 12 episodes is generally enough time for this to happen, but Tokyo Ghoul could not accomplish this at all. It force feeds emotional situations down our throats, expecting viewers to sympathize with whomever is having an issue during any particular episode. The problem is, no character is developed to the point where I'd care about them in the first place. Speaking on Kaneki a bit, his characterization is not particularly weak, however, the way the creators went about it was quite counter productive for a show of this type and length- it was not until very later on in the show did we see some real development for him, and by that point, its effectiveness was little at best.
The characters are not the only seemingly lost aspects of the show, as the direction the show wanted to head in was quite skewed. This is a common problem in anime: the show does not know where it wants to go. At one point it will focus on the Ghouls vs. Doves, then it will jump to deep character relations, etc. The problem is none of these individual parts are fleshed out enough for viewers to really understand motivations and enjoy anything. And the ending. It certainly came as a surprise. I have not read a lick of the manga, (which ironically ended the same day as the anime.) therefore, I have no basis of comparison. However, the ending of Tokyo Ghoul is the largest example the skewed directions I just mentioned. It came out of nowhere. Literally nowhere. Everything about the show changed instantly. To be honest, it would have been enjoyable if the show gave itself time to get to the point. However, it fails in this regard as well.
As a positive, the show for the most part, looks great. Ghoul forms are  uniquely designed, and overall quality is medium-high. The show is not consistently good looking however, as many have pointed out. Animation can also be a bit wonky, but for the most part, is solid. This may deter a bit visually, however compared to the story flop, it is quite minimal. Sound wise, the show performs quite well. The OP and ED are simply superb, the OP being one of my favorites for the Summer 2014 season. The BGM did its job well, especially during the final episodes of the show. The sound, and to a lesser extend, animation and art, are strong points for this show.
Finishing Tokyo Ghoul, I really didn't know how to react. Honestly, I liken this show to Evangelion in many ways, for those of you who have seen it. However, this show fails on so many basic levels, that it simply does not deserve a solid score. However, if you do choose to watch regardless, it is highly recommended to wait for the BDS, as the show is quite censored in the visual department for blood and gore. I don't necessarily regret watching this show, but could it have been done better? Hell yes.
Have fun.",6
"
                What do you get when you have X men meet Resident Evil? That would be Tokyo Ghoul.
Tokyo Ghoul is an anime that contained a large amount of hype stemming from those who have read the manga, and for good reasons too. The premise would sound very enthralling and interesting to those who are in love with the supernatural and psychological genres of fiction, like myself. Since the show also throws in a high dosage of fast-paced graphic violence here and there along with a good soundtrack, you pretty much have the most entertaining show of this season, right!? Wrong. What makes Tokyo Ghoul a below-average
                  show at best comes from its mediocre job of the most vital components that a show must have: the story, the pacing, and its themes. Instead, Tokyo Ghoul feels like a rushed adaptation of what seems to be a promising and worthwhile story. While its music and most of its characters are well-developed, the show suffers from an incredibly poor direction. 
What Tokyo Ghoul fails to do with its story is provide a coherent focus on what it wants to show you. Essentially, the story is about a college student named Ken Kaneki who tries to find his place in a world that is full of violence and hate. The cause of this violence and hate come from those known as ghouls, who are biologically-evolved humans that feed off of other humans. Long story short, Kaneki, due to a horrific accident, becomes a half human, half ghoul and must learn to live in a society that offers tranquility to humans but hatred and oppression towards ghouls. While the synopsis and exposition for the show are delivered very well, experiencing the bulk of the story will make you feel as though it is ultimately unorganized and messy. The reason for this comes from the extremely awkward pacing and the overbearing focus on subplots that feel completely unnecessary and very rushed, causing you to question the choice of direction for the show. 
What also makes the story of this show mediocre comes not from the main character Kaneki, but rather from the supporting cast of characters and the been-there-done-that tropes connected with them. I honestly don't think that I'm lying when I say that Tokyo Ghoul probably has one of the most boring and predictable cast supporting of characters you can view in an anime today. The presentation of the many different characters isn't the problem I had with them. The central problem came from the fact that each and every one of the supporting characters' actions are completely predictable along with their personalities. For example, the character Nishiki is the obvious hotheaded male who will always react to an insult that you can find in many different anime's. The character known as Hide represents the all-to-familiar obnoxiously loud friend of the protagonist of an anime. Kaneki, while being a pretty decent protagonist, also shows many tropes that many should already be accustomed to in other shows, the most notable being the frightened and soft-spoken character who always needs to get pushed around in order to do something, which is what the majority of his scenes in the anime involve. However, like I said, Kaneki is still much more enjoyable and developed than the show's various characters that seem unique at a first glance, but quickly become easy to read.
What's also disappointing about Tokyo Ghoul is not only its disjointed pacing and focus of characters, but also its focus on the different genres it tries to become. While researching Tokyo Ghoul for the first time, one would notice that it is described as a psychological action mystery with horror elements thrown in it. The problem is that the show lies many times about the genres it delves into, with the exception of action and drama. In terms of the psychological aspects of the show, the first and last episodes are literally the only episodes that contain a well done manner of psychological elements, while the other episodes of the show completely forget about the psychological aspects that were being shown previously in favor of flashy action and very cheesy comedy that will sometimes appear in various episodes. Because of these irritations, the show has a hard time figuring out its identity for a genre for it to fall under. 
Although I said that the flashy action takes away the psychological/suspense aspects of the show, I must admit that I would be lying if I said that the action is mediocre. What makes the action in Tokyo Ghoul so damn good is not just the fact that it is both thrilling and fast, but it's also because of the music and art that make it even more exciting. The soundtrack of the show is incredibly addicting and perfectly fuses in with the action on screen. The visuals are also breathtaking to look at, especially from the many transformations and horrific, yet beautiful, mutations of the characters who are ghouls. The one annoyance that you shall find with the show's action, however, is undoubtedly its heavy censoring. I can understand that Tokyo Ghoul is a story that involves a plethora of gore, but the show is censored to the point of it looking like as though it's rated PG. 
Tokyo Ghoul is an anime that ultimately does not feel as though it is has a clear pathway for what it's trying to show you. The pacing is disgruntled and suffers from focusing on too many different plot points in only a total of twelve episodes. Majority of the characters in the show are predictable and boring with their actions and how their personality is presented to you. The question is, is Tokyo Ghoul worth the watch? To this I would answer, yes it is. While aspects such as the pacing and censoring can be annoying, Tokyo Ghoul still manages to offer up some very impressive world-building and exposition while trying its best to stay focused on its story. The action and music in the show is also some of the best that you can find in an anime this year. Overall, Tokyo Ghoul is a show that shows much potential for improvements, but still proves to be a fun ride for those who love aesthetically directed action and minor psychological elements, all under twelve episodes.",5

                One of the most popular anime of Summer 2014, after 1 episode Tokyo Ghoul really break the Top Watching List of 2014. For the fans, Tokyo Ghoul is a good getaway series.  But behind the fact, Tokyo Ghoul have a various lack in their performance.
The story told us about Kaneki Ken, a boy who accidentally turned into a Ghoul. Ghoul is a man-eating monster that founded in Islamic Folklore. At first, Tokyo Ghoul seems so promising many things, but in the reality, it failed. The story has a relatively slow pacing, for example in one episode only happened a few events only. And sometimes
                  a dull feeling occurs in the story. The other problem that occurs is the is the individual elements of the story is not going so well, the mystery is relatively predictable, the battle scenes is decent and over-simplistic.  The plot seems not focusing on the main story, it spews out everywhere like a juice. The anime have a decent and fair enjoyment.
The animation seems decent, with a combination of typical battle scenes and common battle effect.  Also, there are some ‘gore’ scenes that been censored, it really reduce the horror feeling of the story. While the sound settings are good, Opening Songs is good and tolerated and the seiyuu did a fairly good job.
The character of Tokyo Ghoul done their roles pretty well. There is some scene that conducts some development, but despite that, the main problem that occurs is the lack of the main character development. Why? Because it feels very forced and far-fetched.  The characters have developed but not relate the development with the story itself. Also, the motive of the villain is very notional and still abstract.   
Tokyo Ghoul maybe breaks the watching list of 2014, the anime have a relatively rare settings but have many flaw and mistakes. Is it good……..? or bad……?. The answer lies in the center…",6

                As a non-manga reader of the original Tokyo Ghoul, i am going to base my review purely on this animated title.
I feel that this show has a brilliant array of aspects to it it, the combat is very gripping and intense, there is violence, a significant amount of it which heightens the viewer's engagement with the situation, generally i'd say that these 12 episodes are very emotive and dramatic, which is shown very cleverly as becomes more obvious towards the end.
Dipping into the story for the first time is a bit of a shocker, and a lot to take in, but throughout, this anime will
                  give you a great slice of life experience from the perspective of a main character who grows to understand more about himself as the show persists. The set up is oriented about the friction between humans and a race of humanoid like beings: ghouls, and this friction is described and felt so vividly at times which i greatly credit the show for. 
There is no doubt in my mind that this is a very engaging series, and asides from the violence, it does have the ability to fit a very wide range of viewers' tastes. This anime has a mature feel to it, and the art is the best I've come across yet. Continuing with my point of the show being very easily likable, there's a hell of a lot crammed into this (what frankly should be longer) series of episodes, which adds to the level of drama but perhaps detracts in that at times it feels rushed.
But essentially, if you're okay handling drama and violence, you'll not be disappointed. Tokyo Ghoul is a very reputable anime, that really will leave you on the edge of your seat at times!",8

                  INTRO
=================
It has always intrigued me how zombies or flesh eating humans has not made much of a presence in the anime industry. There were shows like Highschool of the Dead (and that turned into a fanservice horsecrap), Hellsing (mostly vampires but there was and an arc which featured great zombie actions), Sankarea (which mainly focuses on romance and hope), Ore was zombie desu ka (which was quite an oddity but its one of those shows that I can watch for pure stupid fun!), and a couple more.
                  There was really no show in this genre that has truly captivated me; then came Tokyo Ghouls...at least I first thought it would.
=================
             THE REVIEW
=================
The series started off great. You have this normal college student named Kaneki who has a crush on this girl who share the same interest as him. All is good and well when shit quickly hits the fan and he ended up becoming a zombie; not just an ordinary zombie but one that is self-aware and has an unrelenting appetite to human flesh. It was great how the series tries to explore the dilemmas that a ghoul has to go through in his everyday life and how the everything is not as it seems.
The show was great until Ep 4 came. Everything just went so effin fast. The show introduced this psycho who wants to be more than friends with kaneki. The episode started off from exploring different character scenes and the psycho trying to woo kaneki over and within a couple of minutes they end in this arena slaughterhouse. It goes worse as the series went on and the last minutes of the final episode just puts that nail in the coffin.
The pacing is just so terrible that it's hard to sympathize with the character's plight. The one saving grace this show had is the last episode where they showed Kaneki's inner monologue. Now that is great way to show a character's state of mind. It is a huge disappointment and a wasted potential as I feel that Tokyo Ghoul is one of those character study shows all the while showing some great action scenes. There is just so many things happening to coherently fit into a 1 cour show. It was only until Ep 6 that I found out that there was a manga. Reviews on it has been pretty positive and I have seen that it was also recently finished so I am going to start reading it soon.
Let's not also forget the censorship. Oh GOD! THE CENSORSHIP!! There are freaking times when the screen gets cut in half or just fades to black and all you hear is the audio. For god's sake! Studio Pierrot knows that this is a mature show aimed at an adult audience so why the fuck are you guys doing this? I will not be surprised if they end up removing those in BR just to boost its sales and  that will be very underhanded, man.
=================
             VERDICT
=================
The art style and premise got me intrigued; the direction of the show made me wince. So, to finally wrap things up I will now be giving a final score which comprises the built-in scoring system coupled with my personal bias and a fairly complicated process of wiping my lips clean with a tissue smeared with aromatic blood after taking a sip at a bloody testicle juice mixed  with a straw made from dried human intestines makes me want to give Tokyo Ghoul a score of..
6.4/10!
A show with potential hampered by the production staff and dubious marketing strategies. Fans of the genre will be left hanging by the noose and is advised to look for their craving somewhere else. If you don't mind horrible pacing and extreme censorship you can stay for the action which is still pretty good.",6

                Tokyo Ghoul was easily one of the most hyped titles in 2014.
That's an undeniable fact. The manga got lots of attention before and all the fans were happy to see their new favourite thing animated. But oh boy were they disappointed when it started airing.
The animation in general was, for 2014 standards, below average for the most part. Certain visual effects, such as the Kagunes were well-done The character figures were a mix of good and bad, with the good ones leaving memorable expressions on the viewer and the bad ones being stereotypical character designs everybody will have forgotten about in a week. The backgrounds,
                  however, were all largely well-done and one could see the effort being put into them, a quality which is still present in the lower-budget sequel that is Route A. But well, this is where the good parts end. The general animation looked horrible for the most part to the point where one could see the weird looking limbs during fight scenes.
The soundtrack wasn't too memorable but it fit the atmosphere of the show. The Opening was not too happy yet a bit too happy in general to completely capture the feeling of the show.
The voice acting wasn't too outstanding either. Most characters weren't too memorable and there wasn't too much effort put into it for the biggest part. It was average voice acting, perhaps a bit less considering the modern anime standard.
Let's now move on the important parts:
the story and the characters.
If one were to get vulgar, one could simply say ""they sucked ass"" but since I want to give a reason as for why that is so, let me elaborate on it:
The premise was basically ghouls living in Japan among humans.
It is above average for originality and differing from the modern ""haha, everything is moeblob or medieval fantasy action"" standard. Bonus points for that. Unfortunately, that's where the pros end and the cons begin. It was wasted. For the biggest part nobody ever seems to do anything against them, save for one special unit and warning signs telling kids not to leave their houses once the sun has sunk, and the ghouls themselves have close to no kind of order. The humans acting completely normal despite knowing there are dangerous beasts out there is somewhat questionable as well. And saying ""they are an urban legend"" is no excuse because there obviously is an anti-ghoul squad.
The pacing of it was goddamn awful and was faster than a Ferrari. One could tell that the directors simply wanted to get the boring parts over with and show some scenes that ""kick ass"".
It had no kind of complexity to it and was mainly just X moving to place 1 because event Y required him to do so. It was plot-driven and the characters were reacting instead of acting.
The story itself ended with a cliffhanger after having shown Kaneki getting super insta speed character development over the course of 10 minutes and going from a crybaby to a ""badass"" that wouldn't bat an eye even if he lost his legs.
Which leads us to the next section, the characters.
These are mainly made up out of semi archetypes like the crybaby protagonist, the strong female, the cute loli and the mysterious old leader. But cliches are cliches, right? Yeah, no.
Touka is a generic tsundere girl for the most part and has largely any kind of conflict until the Tsukiyama arc is over. This was a good backdrop yet provided no kind of development for her as a character since it was simply forgotten 10 minutes later.
Kaneki is a crybaby who has lived a hard childhood which gave him the mindset ""it's better to be hurt than to hurt"" which for a large part excuses his actions. His development as a character was fairly interesting to see yet whenever he seemed to finally do something on his own, he turned into the baby he was at episode 1. In the final episodes he seemed to receive some sort of development which, unfortunately, happened way too quick to feel like proper development. It was like he was turned into another character.
And now for some good excused scorings:

Personality: 4/10
Backdrop: 4/10

                Tokyo Ghoul is another fine example that animes are not for kids. The anime thrills you. They start with huge bang and ends with even bigger bang. The last episode leaves you begging for more. They lost momentum somewhere in between but its completely fine they made up for it with last episode that makes u scream with **** being tortured, question the world as **** speaks, and make u jump along with the action sequence. 
Flaws:
Despite of the epicness i have mentioned there are some loopholes as well. If you haven't read the manga then its fine but if you have then you will
                  be left disappointed as lot of scenes are skipped. Censorship is the worst thing that the studio have gone to that anime. The anime are definitely not for kids and yet they are censoring every blood scene as its gonna effect some adult minds. Cowardly act by studio or trick to make viewers buy Blu ray discs either way its a pathetic act from studio. So if you have patience then please wait for Blu ray to come out. When all said and done Anime should have been 24 episodes long, scenes are skipped, pace is too fast, leaves you with an incomplete story. All these flaws would have been avoided if studio would have been a little more sensible. 
Story:
The first episode is enough to tell you that story is a masterpiece. Different people trying to make world a better place but their ways of achieving its make the world even a worse place. Story make you question your perception of  stereotype. And gives you some lessons as well. Sometimes being good is enough you have to let the beast inside you to go out to save your justice. Thats what the story taught me and you will realize what am i talking about in last episode
Characters:
There isn't a single character that disappoints in any way.Its an all out crowd of bad ass characters in just one anime.
Enjoyment:
If you are into psychological thriller then you will enjoy it most. Those looking for action, drama or little bit of horror will enjoy it as well. There are some funny scenes in animes but its mostly dominated by action, suspense, horror, sorrow and thrills.",8

                Tokyo Ghoul is one of the most popular shows of the summer. Adapted from a popular manga, Tokyo Ghoul is set in an alternate reality in which beings called ghouls exist. Ghouls appear to be normal humans, but possess superhuman strength and survive by feeding on humans. Kaneki Ken is a college student who unwittingly receives the organs of a ghoul during an emergency transplant. Tokyo Ghoul follows Kaneki's new life as a half-human, half-ghoul.
I was instantly intrigued by Tokyo Ghoul and the first episode did a nice job of sucking me in. I was prepared for a dark, gritty thrill-ride. Unfortunately, Tokyo Ghoul did
                  not meet my expectations and turned out to be the most over-hyped show of the summer.
Perhaps at the root of all of its problems is the fact that Tokyo Ghoul should have been twice as long. No matter how you cut it, trying to cram such a massive amount of information into only 12 episodes will never end well. I'm unfamiliar with the manga, but judging from those who have read it, the anime skipped a significant amount of the story and this is painfully evident in the choppy, broken pacing of the anime. The first few episodes flow smoothly enough, only to devolve into a mess by the show's conclusion. There's no sense of transition or linkage, and there's simply not enough time allowed for any meaningful character development. Moreover, pivotal plot points are given hardly more than a glance and they fail to really hit home because--again--there's not enough time. Why such a popular and anticipated adaptation was given only 12 episodes, I will never understand. The broken structure of Tokyo Ghoul is saved only by the fact that at the end of the day, the plot is still interesting. Yes, Tokyo Ghoul is a poorly-executed mess, but the ride is still fun enough to hold your attention.
I really disliked Kaneki as a character. I don't know how his progression goes in the manga, but in the anime his characterization is pretty damn bad. Even as the story jumps aimlessly all over the place, at least it's still going somewhere. Kaneki remained static throughout the show and as its main protagonist, this provides for a very frustrating viewing experience. I found that Touka was much more engaging on screen and I felt that she definitely stole the show. Touka is dynamic, angsty, headstrong, and she is by far Tokyo Ghoul's best aspect. With regards to the anti-ghoul investigators, I'm not exactly sure how they factor into the plot. They seemed to exist simply for the sake of existing and only really contributed to one or two pivotal plot points. By the second half of the show it's easy to dismiss them as almost irrelevant. The rest of the characters didn't get enough screen time for me to really have any opinion on them.
At the end of the day, Tokyo Ghoul is pretty much the definition of wasted potential. Appealing art, an intriguing story, and well-received source material does not equal a good end product. Combine that with a measly 12 episodes, some of the worst pacing I've ever seen, an atrocious ending, an even more atrocious opening theme (I really don't understand its appeal), and you have the formula for how to create a massive disappointment. Tokyo Ghoul's two redeeming factors: Touka and the intrinsic appeal of the story. I certainly hope the second season will not make the same mistakes as the first.",6
"
                I came in with a positive mindset, and went out with a negative one. I haven't read the manga, but I really felt like this could be the next best thing I was going to watch. But oh man I was wrong.
It isn't that bad actually, in fact the universe and concept is VERY well done, but just like SAO, it's excecuted more poorly than a backwards bowling shot. The series itself looks great, and the OP and ED sound awesome. However, the characters was what really ruined it for me.
Meet Kaneki, a boy who doesn't want to stop crying. Now I know that he's
                  turned into a ghoul, but sometimes I just feel that he goes overboard with the complaining. I'm not gonna spoil about what happens in the end, but for me it was very underwhelming.
Also there's Touka, your average fangirl favorite. She's just there to make her seem like the perfect character, which I found extremely bland. Also the relationship between her and Kaneki was weak at best.
There are also other characters, but I don't feel like they are too important.
The BIGGEST complaint I have, is the fact that every ghoul is a handsome young boy or girl. First of all, why. This was the perfect opportunity to show off the dark and gritty life of being a middle-aged man in Tokyo, but no. Of course everyone had to be handsome and long-haired.
Also, why is coffee the only human beverage the ghouls can drink? I mean REALLY? That is so pathetic
Overall, I'm giving this a 4, because I really like the universe and the art. Although it's pretty dissapointing that GIFs on Tumblr are more interesting than the show itself",4
"
                Tokyo Ghoul will capture your attention with the captivating storyline in episode one, and will leave you interested throughout the series with its mixture of action, horror, and psychological concepts. The series will then end by leaving you thinking about the world of ghouls and humans, and who the monster really is. Are ghouls in the wrong for simply wanting to survive? Are humans right to exterminate the ghouls because the ghouls are killing people? There are so many questions you will be asking yourself as you watch this series.
An interesting aspect of the series was the use of weapons in the form of “Kagune”.
                  Each ghoul possesses a Kagune that is unique to them, so each one is different. Kagune come from the ghoul’s body and can be many forms, from a blade to claws to wings and many more. Ghouls use their Kagune to attack humans, as well as other ghouls. On top of all that, humans have found a way to harness the power of a ghoul’s Kagune and are able to turn the Kagune into a weapon for the human’s use. This somewhat levels the playing field between ghouls and humans. It is nice to see the humans stand a chance against the ghouls and not just get wiped out. If you have seen D.Grayman or Akame ga Kill, the weapon concept is similar.
The characters are memorable, with development throughout the season. The animation is well-done. The story progresses at a decent pace with a proper mixture of action and dialogue. The violence is heavy, but in the version I watched, it is censored by covering the most grotesque animation with black, which is not unique to Tokyo Ghoul, it seems to be the most common way to censor violence in anime. For me personally, this was one of the few negatives I would mention about the series, if you are going to censor the anime, do not make it so obvious, especially when all the gruesome sounds are still present. In conclusion, there is a censored and an uncensored version, so if you do not handle violence well, there is a friendlier version for you.
You might enjoy this if: You can handle a brain-twisting anime that will touch on your buttons of psychological fear. If you enjoyed Deadman Wonderland, you will likely enjoy Tokyo Ghoul.
You might not like it if: You are sensitive to violence, gore, and the horror genre. Certain scenes of Tokyo Ghoul are some of the most grisly out there.
Note to the Viewer: Be prepared for an action-packed thrill ride that will have you captivated from the first episode!",9
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is directed by Shuhei Morita which was based on a manga by Sui Ishida.
STORY (8):
The story follows Ken Kaneki, a college student who meets a woman named Rize Kamishiro at Anteiku, a coffee shop. They share an interest in literature and plan a date. However, Rize attacked Kaneki and it was revealed that Rize was a ghoul, human-like beast that feeds on human flesh. While Rize tries to kill Kaneki for good, she was crushed by a falling platform. Both Kaneki and Rize are sent to hospital. The doctor decided to transplant Rize's organs into Kaneki's. So from now on, Kaneki has to
                  live a life of a half-human/half-ghoul.
The concept sounds interesting but it suffers from some lack of explanations. Like ghouls, how do they exist in the world and how do they interact and deal with life.
ART (8):
Many people are bothered by censorship of blood and organs. However, I didn't mind that as long as they have good plot and good characters. The animation is good. At least they give some creepy vibe but not so creepy to the point that I fear for my life all the time like the design of the eyes that are red.
The ghouls design looks like Gaara when he becomes a beast, however the difference is the pattern and color.
SOUND (8):
At least the opening and ending song is good.
CHARACTER (7):
You know, normally in action anime, the characters are the weakest.
The characters that stood out the most in this anime are Shu & Toka.
Shu is cunning and calm just like Hisoka from Hunterxhunter. Mamoru Miyano did a great job in making this character cunning.
Toka is a badass and she always has a mean attitude just like Revy from Black Lagoon. However, I do like her in the way she is brave and willing to take risks.
Yoshimura is like a father figure who is concerned about ghouls and especially try to help Kaneki in every possible way he can.
Hinami Fueguchi could at least have more material to work with because she always stays at home and never fights. But then again, I wasn't expecting much from her.
Ken Kaneki, oh boy. Where do I begin? He is the weakest of the bunch. I can understand that he is trying to adapt to a life of a human-ghoul. But the problem is that in the later episodes, he became useless and more annoying just like Yukiteru Amano from Mirai Nikki. He has the ultimate power among the bunch but the problem is he just couldn't do anything to save himself. Even during a fight scene with Amon, he just dodges but never land a single attack. I just feel ashamed of him.
CONCLUSION (8):
Although I have problems with the show, I enjoyed this anime regardless. I just hope that they will at least try to give some characters more development and give us more explanation on how ghouls exist. 
So for what it's worth I give it an 8/10.",8

                ""Tokyo Ghoul is so deep and mature!""
- A random pretentious edgy 12-year-old 
After the ending of Attack on Titan, the anime community realized that they needed something to fill the void that was left behind. Another anime about humans vs. monsters, with beautiful music and visuals (aimed at 12-year-olds who believe that everything with blood is mature), but that in reality is just an advertisement for the way better manga was exactly what the community wanted. And then we got Tokyo Ghoul, one of the most overhyped anime I've ever seen. If you heard the fans talking about it, you almost believed that this was
                  the best work of fiction ever created, with deep philosophical themes, well developed characters and a brilliant story. In reality there was another damn story about humans vs. monsters (and one of the humans becomes a monster, so original), a bland cast and an attempt to raise the question ""are the ghouls or the humans the monsters?"", but even Elfen Lied handled this better.
~Story~ 2/10
Kaneki is your average shy and boring protagonist, who has a date with a girl who's at least ten times as hot as he is. Then she turns into a ghoul (a monster that eats humans) and tries to eat our poor hero, because of plot convenience some kind of organization drops a bunch of metal bars exactly on the girl and she dies, the wounded Kaneki who magically survives, gets some organs from the girl and he turns into a half-ghoul. Of course it's totally possible for a doctor to transplant organs from a ghoul into a human without getting trouble and of course our hero is now special, because he's both human and ghoul. He teams up with a bunch of ghouls who only eat death people and befriends a tsundere called Touka. Then we watch how the ghouls are victimized, because how can humans be so evil that they try to kill monsters who try to eat them? Only 99% percent of ghouls is evil, there is no reason to kill all of those murderous, psychotic monsters because 1% of the ghouls is good, right? What kind of logic is that?! ""We have to make sure that the audience feels sorry for the monsters, let's make the humans kill a little innocent ghoul girl's mother and laugh psychotic while doing it, that's not obvious and cheap right?"" It is, all the villains in this show look like comic book villains, laugh while murdering innocent people and probably strangle little cats for fun, they're not realistic at all! Everyone tries to kill poor Kaneki, because apparently half-ghouls are tasty, why? I have no idea. There is something going on between episode 1 and 11 that can be described as a plot, but you can summarize it in one sentence: people try to kill Kaneki and ghouls are victimized, the end. But then there is a shocking, extremely original plot twist....... victimization- power-up. Oh and an unsatisfying conclusion, read the manga or wait for season 2!
{CONCLUSION}
The story consists of the constant and never ending victimization of monsters. No, there is no reason to sympathize with the ghouls. Yes, of course they just want to survive, but the same thing goes for the humans. And the humans aren't victimized 24/7 in this show. The ghouls aren't 100% evil, but neither are they 'misunderstood' like the director of this anime seems to think. The story is weak and there are unanswered questions and plotholes EVERYWHERE! Like why do the humans keep living the same way as before, when they are surrounded with murderous psychotic human eating monsters? Where are Kaneki's parents? Why does a certain persons hair turn white? How do metal bars fall exactly on the right spot? How can ghouls drink coffee, but no other kind of drinks? Why is every human either pathetic or evil?Why didn't the humans just force everyone to eat food and then checked the people who started vomiting, would that be too logical? And the most important question: why do people claim that this anime has a good story?!
~Animation~ 9/10
The backgrounds were detailed and gorgeous, the character designs were original and the battle scenes looked epic. I have only one problem with the animation: censorship. I personally hate it when half of the screen is covered with black bars, and I assume that most other people aren't a fan of black bars either.
{CONCLUSION}
It looked great, even though the story is (supposed to be) dark, the animators used vivid colors, I think that this was a good idea. The gouls looked beautifully creepy during the fight scenes (look at those eyes), but the censoring was horrible.
~Sound~ 9/10
'Unravel' was amazing. Yes, it was a bit edgy, but I don't even care. The OST's were all somewhere in between decent and almost perfect and they were used in the right scenes. The Japanese voice acting was also top notch, especially the voice actors of Rize and Tsukiyama brought their characters to life.
{CONCLUSION}
The sound was extremely good, the ending song was forgettable but the opening makes up for that. The (Japanese) voice acting was great and the OST's were used at the right moments.
~Characters~ 1/10
They were a pain to watch. The most side characters just were there for 2 minutes and then disappeared just to never come back again. Kaneki is a walking punchbag, who cries a lot, pretty much the whole anime. And I don't feel sorry for him, because he is an overvictimised whiny brat. His development/ character swap in the last episode was weird and unrealistic (Spoiler: when most people are almost tortured to death, they don't turn in a badass). The best thing about him is his masker, great main character! Touka is your average tomboy and all her development is thrown out of the window in the last episode. Then you have bestfriend-kun, oldinspirationalman-kun, psychomurder-kun and victimizedlittlegirl-chan. Boring. Rize was an okay character during her 5 minutes of screen time and Amon seemed to think like a rational human being, those two were endurable. Special mention for Shuu Tsukiyama, he was great meme material and another horrible sadist, obsessed with our amazing main character, really what this anime needed!
{CONCLUSION}
One of the weakest casts I've seen in a very long time. The main character is a joke, the rest of the cast a nuisance. The were either bland or over-the-top evil and sadistic. None of them was memorable and their development was either nonexistent or it came out of nowhere. A plain bad cast, but the voice acting was pretty good, what a waste.
~Enjoyment~ 4/10
Beautiful music, great animation, shitty story and characters, what's new? This seems to be a trend of the last few years (yes, there are exceptions, but in general most new anime follow this pattern). This anime was enjoyable, but so damn forgettable, nothing about the story or the characters was memorable. If you turn of your brain and just want to watch an action series with nice visuals and sound, then Tokyo Ghoul is made for you. But if you want something with substance, don't watch this show. Also the last episode was predictable and the lack of a conclusion is annoying. Maybe that's the biggest problem, it ends with an open ending (watch the sequel) and leaves the viewer with a lot of unanswered questions, but it's not a cliffhanger. I don't want to watch the sequel, because I don't care anymore. If they ended it with something less predictable, I might have felt the urge to watch the damn sequel. Right now I just don't care. 
{CONCLUSION}
It could have been great. Imagine: an anime with amazing visuals, great music, an actual story about prejudice an discrimination and well written characters. Sadly enough, the last two things were nowhere to be found in Tokyo Ghoul. It's just another shounen anime, that's trying way to hard to be a seinen, but fails miserably. It was overhyped, overrated and a waste of time. If you want to watch a mindless shounen with epic battles, Tokyo Ghoul is great choice, but if you want anything with substance, then I would advice you to skip it. Peace!",3

Preface:
This is the first part of my full Tokyo Ghoul review, and will be solely for the first season. I'm splitting them up because I felt it would be easier to follow and allow me to go into more detail about why this season is worthy of a decent score. This is NOT a manga review. Those have a place, and this is not it. I have not read the Tokyo Ghoul manga, but I have informed myself of where
                  it differs from the anime.
Artwork and Animation: 6
The first and last several episodes aside, Tokyo Ghoul has very average character models, fluidity, and overall consistency. While there are some nicely animated fight scenes, and a few very intense moments, the majority of it is 'meh'. There are some scenes where the kagune look like living, pulsating tentacles with marks and veiny looking details drawn on, and other times they look like a 4 year old went wild with the red, purple, and blue crayons. Overall, it works, but this isn't some hyperrealistic animation.
Sound and Voice Acting: 8
Natsuki Hanae does a great job playing the timid, scared, and conflicted Ken in Tokyo Ghoul. While not Oscar material, definitely a good role, and one I found believable. Mamoru Miyama (Light, Death Note) is glorious as Tsukiyama, and Rie Kugimiya (Alphonse, FMAB) is fantastic as Juzo.  Overall decent sounding and with a veteran voice cast, can't go wrong here.
The opening theme, ""Unravel"" is a nice song to start the show, and a good mood setter as well.
Characters: 7
Unlike Root A, it's very plain that Ken is the MC here. After his unplanned initiation to the world of ghouls, Ken becomes an extremely conflicted and detached person; unable to reconcile who he is, or what he has to do to survive, he shuts down and withdraws from life. 
Through Ken, we're able to see the injustice and morally gray lives of the ghouls. There are those who would see their status as ghoul as an affliction, something that turns them into outcasts on the fringe of society, hunted by the government. There are also those who embrace their identity of ghoul as empowerment and use it to commit unspeakable evil. 
Ken, as both human and ghoul, (due to the emergency surgery he receives after being attacked by a ghoul) is lost. On the one hand, he has to eat to survive, and the only way is to consume the flesh of a human. Yet, Ken refuses to give up his humanity, seeing it as cannibalism and denies himself until the point where he's being driven insane by his insatiable hunger for flesh that he would kill his own best friend. With nowhere else to turn, Ken manages to find a way out that doesn't involve murder, but does involve him addressing his inner turmoil.
Other cast of note include: the emo scenester Touka, who serves as Ken's guide into the world of ghoul, Hide, Ken's best friend and human influence, Amon, the naive young special investigator of the CCG, and the wonderfully sick Tsukiyama and Jason.
Story: 8 
It's this angst that drives the first season of Tokyo Ghoul, and it works well. The inner conflict of Ken trying to reconcile his dualistic nature, and learning what it means to be hunted for things far beyond his control lend an air of mystery and suspense to the show, for there are far, far worse ghouls out there than the ones he meets at Antique. 
Newly introduced into this hidden world, Ken learns that there are factions of ghouls that would seek to overthrow the CCG, the Commission of Counter-Ghoul, a special police force created to eradicate the terroristic threat that the ghouls pose to the wards of Tokyo. They're violent, merciless, and extremely bloodthirsty. Not only do these ghouls want to kill humans and devour them, but some of the sickest among them even hunger for ghoul as well.
Along with these groups, there are also peaceful ghouls that try to camouflage themselves in society by posing as ordinary people in mundane jobs, as students, and as a human being. There is a good portion of the plot dealing with how conflicts between the groups arise, which plays out suspensefully. The nail that sticks out gets hammered, and the ghouls are no different. The ghouls who commit the most crimes get more CCG investigators sent to their area, which further escalates the tension and violence. When these aggressive ghouls invade the territory of the peaceful ones, inquisitors follow, spelling a change in the way of life for those of the ghoul persuasion. 
The plot functions in small arcs, with Nishio, Tsukiyama, and Jason + Aogiri being the different headlining acts split up with the CCG side of the story as seen through the eyes of Amon and Kureo Mado. The action has weight and consequences, and nearly turns into grimdark horror by the end. Overall, the pacing and flow are pretty even, though the series thickens at the end in anticipation of Root A, it doesn't suffer for it. 
Enjoyment: 8
Tokyo Ghoul is fun. I've heard it likened unto being a digest version of some heavier anime that are more existential or focused on moral ambiguity, but Tokyo Ghoul is more about the action than a deeper meaning. There are a couple of twists, but nothing that groundbreaking. Personally, what was better about Tokyo Ghoul than Root A was how it was focused on the characters, and their interactions within themselves AND with the others around them versus being one giant battle for the entire season. 
Ken is faced with the trolley problem (sacrifice the few to save the many) late in the season, and due to his personality and his life up until that point, he's unable to decide, since he'd always been the timid, repressed one that went along with the crowd. Crippled with indecision, Ken ultimately ends up saving no-one when he tries to save everyone. He is presented with a harsh truth- a consequentialist one. A truth that says that his choices are the ones that he's to be judged on, and that if he chooses not to, then it's all on him- the lives of others, of his friends, family, and even the innocent he fails to protect. 
Overall: 8
tl;dr
+ Character driven story
+ Dark, dramatic, and brutal at times
+/- Some annoying characters
- Anime logic/biology*
*(Getting impaled and living through it, numerous times. Two characters fall off a 50+ floor skyscraper, and the one that gets crushed by falling girders from the same height's organs are in better shape than the one that just fell... like wtf? The force of a ghoul character's kick on a human character hits them with such force that they fly 25 feet or so in the air, through a concrete wall. The acceleration force of that kick alone would have liquefied the other character's organs, never mind the blunt force trauma death.)
Recommend?
Yes, I'd say Tokyo Ghoul is worth a watch. If you like a dark, action oriented show, it'll fill the void nicely.",8
"
                I love this show. I hate the second season, but I love this show. Now, as a warning, I'm aware of the manga, I'm aware that it's supposed to be better, but I have not read it yet. So, no manga bias in any direction going forward. Let's go everybody!
Story : 8
Tokyo Ghoul's story is very character driven, and at some points it even feels a little like... I don't want to say slice of life, but there are a couple of moments. The biggest theme of Tokyo Ghoul is that of Identity Crisis, something I think was very well done here. In addition, this
                  show has some of the best world building I've ever seen, only outclass, in my opinion, by Log Horizon. The show gives several examples of various types and classes of ghouls, from binge eaters, to gourmets, to that one guy that gets killed episode one. Screw you, Nishio.
That said, there are two general issues that drag this from a 9 or 10 to an 8. First, there are a LOT of plot holes early on (e.g. How come falling pipes manage to hurt Rize, a ghoul shown to have some exceptional speed?, How did the CCG get quinques in the first place, if traditional weapons can't hurt ghouls?, etc.). The other major issue is the lack of an ending. Several plot threads are left hanging. This wouldn't bother me too much, since there is a second season, but I'll tackle the issues with that another day.
Art : 6
The art style is well done. The character designs are, at least to me, quite cool-looking, and I love some of the mask designs as well. However, I can't compliment the animation because I CAN'T SEE MOST OF IT. The show is littered with unnecessary censorship. If you watch this show, watch the DVD/BR version. Apparently, the censorship is supposed to be gone in that.
Sound: 9
The voice acting was solidly done. Currently, there is no dub (I can deal), but the original va is brilliantly done, and even features the wonderful hamming of Mamoru Miyano.
The soundtrack is pretty good, though nothing stood out TOO much to me. However, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the opening theme. Unravel is one of the best songs I've heard in a while, and nearly every remix of it I've listened to has been enjoyable, even, shockingly enough, the dubstep version.
Character: 9
Tokyo Ghoul's strongest point, by far. Going hand-in-hand with its world building, the characters are wonderfully explored. The MC, Kaneki Ken, is a character who starts off wimpy, falls in love (okay it was more of a crush), and loses his entire sense of identity. Ah, to be young again. But seriously, as much as he cries and complains about his new situation, he handles it quite well, and as time goes along, he finds the virtues of his fellow ghouls.
Hide is the stereotypical best-friend character, though that didn't stop me from liking him. The best way to describe Touka would be a tsundere, though that's not necessarily a bad thing here. She's still awesome, but not overly fleshed out.
I found Hinami incredibly relatable, especially since she's the character who essentially loses her innocence, and oddly doesn't crumble completely because of it. Plus, as a Japanese language student, I love the whole ""How do you read this kanji?"" thing.
Tsukiyama is just plain brilliant. Creepy, but brilliant. Moving on.
In the CCG, we've got two major characters, Mado and Amon. Mado is easily hate-able, which I can approve of in an antagonist if it's intentional. Amon is a brilliant foil to Kaneki, representing Kaneki's once-held beliefs about ghouls. He's your 'lawful good' character for the show, and I think the whole moral issue with him was wonderfully executed, at least in this season.
Last, but certainly not least is Rize. She's the whole reason we have a plot, and I love her for it. After Kaneki is implanted with her organs, she starts speaking to him like a mix of subconscious and conscious thought. And. She's . Amazing. My only issue is that, like the plot, she just... ends. I would have loved to see her fleshed out more. Was she always a binge eater, or did something drive her to that? Was she sincere with Kaneki, liking books and him, or did she lie just to get another meal?
Enjoyment : 8
This show was a ride, and I don't think there was a single episode that I disliked.
Overall : 8
This show would be an instant recommendation if the second season didn't ruin what good this first season set up. I still think it's brilliant, but I find it hard to recommend something with no good resolution.",8
"
                This anime was eye-catching with its stunning visuals and also its brilliant opening.The opening was extremely detailed as it included the ghoul eyes in the ghouls reflections. Furthermore  its opening sound track brilliantly executed by Yamada Yutaka and it also complimented the stunning art. However it had its downfall as there was a lack of development in the characters background, also it tried to introduce too much characters in 12 episodes. They could have improved this by focusing on the main chracters and by also showing Kaneki's inner conflict with Rise. In my opinion the best episodes were the first and last as both
                  episode kept  the audience at the edge of their seats.Personally I think that the manga was better as you got to see more of Kanzeki's fights as a bad ass. The series story is a very thought out idea as it shows conflict between ghouls and humans just as the writer wanted it, but the main character is a wimp who wants co-existence between human and ghoul he does nothing to show for this except cry throughout the entire series.The last episode however contradicted Ken's wimpy persona and he transformed into a total bad ass which the audience wanted to see. Another fail in character development was that they added a paedophile who did nothing but sniff Ken's blood on a napkin throughout the whole series. I hope that season two fill in the mistakes season one made and also I hope to see more of Rise's past as she is my favourite character in the entire series.",5
"
                 As a stand-alone work, the Tokyo Ghoul anime is enjoyable, but it is lacking; it falls short in a few aspects that could make it truly great. So, if one is trying to choose between watching the anime OR reading the manga, the most fulfilling course of action would be to skip this and find chapter 1. The source material fills the gaps in the anime that prevent it from being more than just a fun thing to watch.
Now, onto the details:
Story - 7/10
It's tough for me to objectively rate the story of Tokyo Ghoul, the anime, without comparing it to the manga, but
                  I'll try my best. The story seems somewhat cliche at first, but it's executed in a manner that makes it very different from anime with similar concepts -- it's a very character-driven story, and because the characters are mostly three-dimensional, well-developed, and fascinating, the story feels fresh. It's engaging and well-paced; it goes fast enough to really suck you in, but it slows down just enough to build suspense, as well. It's definitely not for the faint of heart, or for people who don't like sad stories. But if you're like me and you like dark, tragic stories, Tokyo Ghoul is a good choice. 
Art - 6/10
At first, the art seems okay, if not a little mundane style-wise. As the show progresses, however, it becomes apparent that Tokyo Ghoul needs a more atmospheric and interesting style to suit its themes. Tokyo Ghoul is set apart from other anime in that it has its own brand of twistedness -- after all, it's a story about a protagonist whose body and mind take a turn for the horrific. What Pierrot came up with was, unfortunately, bland and mediocre; aesthetically, the animation just does not suit the story or characters. 
Even worse, the quality of the animation falters quite frequently. For example, when Nishiki kicks Hide, the movements of both the kick and of Hide being sent flying are so fast, choppy and otherwise poorly-executed that it's actually funny. It seems that Studio Pierrot had issues with kicking while animating this, because when Ayato kicks down a door later on, he looks flat-out ridiculous. Tsukiyama's face looks beautiful half of the time, and it looks like one big blunder the other half. Worst of all, if you pause at the right (or rather, wrong...) moment, especially during action scenes, you're bound to come across a hilariously bad frame, or series of frames. At times it seems like the animators were just hoping that viewers wouldn't be paying attention at times when the characters spend a few seconds looking like they were drawn by a middle school kid. However, there are some scenes that are actually very well-done, especially in the later episodes, e.g. Kaneki's hallucinations/internal conversation in the later episodes were both gorgeous and memorable.
Sound: 10/10
The soundtrack is wonderful, both in the show and for listening on its own. Tokyo Ghoul's soundtrack captures the mood and tone of the story in ways that the animation could not even begin to accomplish. It's the perfect juxtaposition of delicate/melancholy and harsh/heavy. If you enjoy this anime, then listening to the soundtrack later on will probably make you emotional, it's that good. Standout tracks include ""Unravel"" (the first opening), ""Glassy Sky"", and ""Licht und Schatten"". The second opening, ""Munou"", was met with mixed feelings from the fanbase -- mostly because it's straight-up bizarre, and it's not the kind of song you would expect from an anime opening at all -- but personally I thought it was beautiful and very fitting, considering Kaneki's psychological deterioration as the series progresses. 
The voice acting is brilliant. (I'm talking about the Japanese here; I don't believe there's a dub out yet as I'm writing this, and it's not like I'd watch a dub of Tokyo Ghoul anyway, considering the perfection of the Japanese acting in this case.) Natsuki Hanae's performance as Kaneki is nothing short of devastating, and I mean that in the best way possible. In scenes where Kaneki was in pain, the voice acting felt so real that it was actually distressing. The other actors did a wonderful job too, of course, but Natsuki Hanae truly blew me away.
Character 7/10
The characters are all very interesting and lovable. I've never heard of a fan who doesn't like Kaneki, and his development is what really makes Tokyo Ghoul so great. Watching him change is truly heartbreaking, and that's the point. The character designs aren't spectacular, but they're all really cool, especially Suzuya's. Suzuya himself is a fascinating character that I got attached to very quickly, and his fight scenes were usually the most entertaining. However, a lot of characters were deprived of the development that they should have gotten. This is another situation in which it's hard to be objective about the anime, because in the manga, characters that the anime neglects development-wise (such as Banjou and Tsukiyama...ESPECIALLY Tsukiyama) go through outstanding development. But disregarding that, they're still great characters. 
Enjoyment - 7/10
You'll enjoy this if you're not looking for a story with some depth but not too much of it. If you want something that will really keep you thinking about it, skip the anime, go for the manga. Or do both.
Overall - 7/10
There are characters and plot points that were full of potential that they weren't allowed to reach, and the animation was mostly lackluster, but it's still a decent anime. Definitely not a masterpiece, but it's good enough.",7

                (This has been adapted from my reddit thread)
Most people hate being something they're not. ""Just be yourself"" is a common phrase used to express the feeling that, as a person, you should just act the way you normally do (within reason). But what happens when this type of mentality is challenged by those around you? Tokyo Ghoul aims to explore this idea by pitting the ghouls versus the humans and how they live their lives in co-existence.
STORY
Tokyo Ghoul stars Kaneki, a young high school student who, early on, takes an interest in another woman. However, during a freak accident, Kaneki is forced to become a
                  ""ghoul"", a person who must feed on human flesh in order to survive.
One of the things I thought the show did well throughout the series was showing the dynamic between ghouls and humans, and what it means exactly to be a ghoul. Most prominent of all is the idea of eating flesh. But besides this, the show looks at more interesting scenarios, such as ghoul and human relationships, how ghouls are treated both by humans and their own comrades, and how to get by in a world not designed for you. I found these parts of the show to be the most interesting. While not on the same level as something like Shinsekai Yori, when the environment holds certain social discrepancies, it always invites interesting situations for the two sides to collide. And the show presents these quarrels in interesting enough ways to make the story enjoyable.
As a negative, I felt Tokyo Ghoul spent too much time on the eating aspect of the ghouls. It becomes apparent early on what they must do (and not do) in order to obtain nourishment. But even for some of the villains, their main trait still revolves around ""food"". I wish there would have been less focus on that and more on other ghoul facets, but that is more of a personal feeling.
I also agree with /u/ThatAnimeSnob's (a reddit user) reasoning that throughout almost the entirety of the series, Kaneki plays a passive role in an aggressive world. 
Besides the final episode, Kaneki is portrayed as weak, helpless, and scared. Because of this, he has to maintain this role. However, the show suffers because of this. The characters around him drive the narrative; Kaneki is usually just along for the ride. Even though he is the lead, it never feels as if his actions provide any effect on what occurs next.
Regardless, the show's pacing is also quite quick. There is never really any clear goal that the characters are looking to achieve. Rather, they deal with the problems presented to them as they come. In this way, the show sort of becomes a ""something happens, take care of it, wait a bit, something happens..."" type of deal. Again, this problem stems from Kaneki's lack of power or hold over the narrative. Because he does not have an active role in the things that happen, and since he is the lead protagonist, there is no clear overall purpose to the show's story-telling.
ANIMATION
Tokyo Ghoul's animation is actually quite good. All of the fight scenes themselves are well choreographed and are easy to follow despite all of the jumping and twirling. The show goes into great detail when a character begins expressing extreme emotion. In these circumstances, the character's faces have actual individual teeth, facial muscles, and a manic facade.
The art style is also quite nice. It mostly sticks to darker colors in order to give a more mature feeling while simultaneously making the world seem darker (both in subject matter and in mood).
Personally, I liked the character designs. Jason's larger physique, Touka's kick-ass ghoul form, Mado's old but wise demeanor. Everyone presented a unique look that fit their personalities well.
The only gripe I have, and so do many others, was the extensive use of censorship. It can be argued that such a device was used so heavily in order to make selling of the actual copies of the show later to increase. But when I am watching the show, and half the screen is black to hide some random dude's missing arm or there is a shower of blue blood due to negative coloring, it does not help it in the slightest.
CHARACTERS
Tokyo Ghoul actually has quite a large cast. Due to this, many of the characters themselves are never fully explored.
Technically speaking, the only main characters are Kaneki and Touka. Kaneki, while pretty much pathetic, does experience the most growth of any of the characters. It is pretty small during the middle of the show, but it does exist. He understands that he is weak and unable to do the things that other ghouls can. He learns that he not only doesn't fit within the ghoul lifestyle but as a human as well. Near the end, he comes to the realization that what he wants and what he thinks are actually completely different. And after correcting his line of thinking, he finally starts to ""just be himself"". But at this point, it is too little, too late.
Touka, contrarily, sees little development. Throughout much of the show, she is a brooding character; more ""tsun"" than ""dere"". She has acclimated to the world around her. She goes to school, does human things, and at the end of the day, resorts to what she needs to in order to survive. These qualities make her out to be a well-rounded character already, meaning there is no room for improvement on her part. They attempt to instill some form of empathy for her following her fight against Mado, but it isn't touched upon enough to have any lasting effects.
The only other notable characters are Jason and Rize. Jason is depicted as being quite psychotic (for obvious reasons), but I felt that his lack of presence throughout the middle of the show dampened his effectiveness as a proper villain.
Rize, in a similar fashion, is alluded to quite often during the show, and makes her best appearance near the story's conclusion. While she isn't necessarily explored, her actions and monologues were quite interesting. Even though she wasn't on-screen much, she definitely left an impression when she was.
SOUND
Both the OP and ED for this show are very, very good. The OP starts off slow and peaceful, but by the halfway point it picks up, making you as energized as the people in that world. In contrast, the ED goes for a mellow tone, with simple beats and a nice rhythm. It helps you to wind down from the craziness that usually happens during that episode.
The rest of the soundtrack is okay. There isn't anything too memorable or of the same quality as the OP and ED (but that is hard to do).
The voice acting performances were very well done, especially by Kaneki, Jason, and Mado. Other notable performances include Touka, Rize, and Tsukiyama (Mr. French-man). In general, everyone did a very nice job.
ENJOYMENT
Tokyo Ghoul had a great opportunity to present a world filled with conflicting sides. I am a fan of all different genres, and while the psychological aspects for the show were fine, it never really expanded beyond that. Yes, there are good fighting scenes present within the show, but to me that wasn't the focus, or at least it shouldn't have been.
I found that many of the characters within the show, besides Kaneki and Touka, were used then quickly forgotten. Examples include Hide (Kaneki's best friend) and Ayato (Touka's brother). This is most likely due to the shows time constraint (only being one-cour) but it never really makes sense to introduce such characters and then not do anything with them.
I don't think this show is the best example of a psychological thriller. It does have these elements, but I think it is more aligned with people who enjoy a darker take on what it means to be human. Does the show even do this well? Not exactly. However, for what it is worth, the show was still a nice watch, even if the ending we received left many unanswered questions.
SUMMARY
Story: Fine, wants to explore ghoul vs. human but with no clear direction
Animation: Good, nice detail and atmosphere mired in censorship
Characters: Fine, some are likable and hated for what they do while most are underdeveloped
Sound: Great, fantastic OP, ED, and voice acting
Enjoyment: Fine, mature but never quite fun
Final Score: 6/10",6
"
                For the longest time since I watched Tokyo Ghoul I've been re-watching it over and over again (even now I'm writing this review while listening to unravel, I just can't get enough of this anime, gomen. xD). And oh, please take note that I haven't read the chapters of which this anime was adapted from so I will review it based on the anime itself not on the adaptation from manga to anime (hope we're clear on that. :p)
So first allow me to say this, Tokyo Ghoul is simply amazing. The story, the art, the character. Zenbu. As for sound? That did it. Words fail
                  me. The moment I listened to the song, I was hooked. The song fits the anime perfectly. Needless to say, I really enjoyed it to my heart's content. *sigh
So let's go down to the details.
We have Kaneki Ken, a shy and bookish university student. He was a regular customer of Anteiku (a coffee shop run by Yoshimura, a ghoul, which serves as a refuge for fellow ghouls in 20th ward) where he met Rize, the binge eater, he instantly had a crush on her but he was about to have the surprise of his life when she attacked him after their date. One thing lead to another, he woke up feeling strange. Thus, his nightmare began when he discovered what he'd become.
I love tragic hero stories because I sincerely believes that those who have experienced the most painful things are the ones who are capable of deep understanding of life, that is if they stick to their values, have the wisdom to endure and the courage to protect the most important thing to them.
Honestly, all the characters have their own story to tell. This is the reason why it's painful to watch because you understand where they're coming from and it's hard to ignore. Although it's almost impossible, I hope they come to understand each other and break the chain of revenge. *sigh
However, I must say, even though I haven't read the manga I feel that the pacing is a bit fast and rushed. Somehow, I know there are many skipped chapters I can understand the disappointment of those who read the manga.
After watching this I read the manga as to what happened next. I can't help myself. And so I'm so ready for season 2. Bring it on!
And oh, I haven't mention that aside from Kaneki, one character that I really love so much is Hide. I kind of know the feeling of having a best friend since childhood so my heart really goes for Hide for being such the best best friend Kaneki could ever have.
*I'm currently reading Tokyo ghoul:re, I wish Hide is somewhere alive, please.*
So much feels. Amazing.",10
"
                Tokyo Ghoul I found to be quite enjoyable, and had amazing art. The voice acting was amazing but the sound effects definitely left more to be desired. The  music they used I felt matched the scene almost perfectly. I did not like however how they left some characters without an answer. Some characters were introduced and seemed like they could have gone someplace with that character but instead they completely abandoned that character within the next episode. However that did not take away the enjoyment of the main story and watching Kaneki slowly adapt to the new life he has been forced to live.
                  The anime is one of the best I've watched and I would highly recommend it to anybody looking for one to watch.",8
"
                Everything problem in this entire anime stems from one simple fact: Too few episodes. 
If this series were a 23 or 24 episode anime, actually hell, even a 16 episode series, this anime would be at least somewhere in the 200's on MAL & a definite better anime. 
However, just to say before I continue, You should watch this series. It's incredibly entertaining and fascinating regardless of what i say or what anyone else says, because I'm going to be objective but i enjoyed this anime 10/10 so you shouldn't let anything anyone, including me, writes dissuade you.  This anime is well worth it.
                  
Anyway
The story suffers, not because the plot is weak but because it's too short. Many parts of the anime are too packed into one, especially the ending which is basically set up in the most retarded way possible. I wish i could write more than that, it almost feels like a disfavor not to, but anything else would be too close to spoilers but in a simple sentence, which is the best i can do & will allow: The ending sucks. 
However, despite the story's incredibly jam fucking packed ridiculousness, It has great, and i mean GREAT, action scenes. Some are short due to length(again, this is already like the 4th problem due to 12 episode slot) & it is rather well portrayed, at least in the sense it's only 12 episodes. It certainly starts off well anyway. 
In summary: Story not so great, it's okay, mah mah desu yanno?because 12 episodes. 
Art: Art is fantastic. 100% great animation, no bad quality episodes(better not be with 12 fucking episodes) & the fight scenes are incredibly well animated. 
Summary: Art good. Episode length not in effect. Wow. 
Sound: Sound is pretty subjective but since most people are morons, I'm going to go ahead & say that the sound is amazing. It's nowhere near my favorite but at the very least, objectively, it's a 8/10. I gave it a 10/10 cause i loved it but still, it's great. Opening is a great song with a vivid animation which fits well with the show. Background music & OST good, not amazing but ranged from good to really good and always portrays scenes well, in fact in some scenes, the background music & OST does a fantastic job & you'll know when. AS for ending, I never watch the endings cause that's fucking pointless but it was okay. Nothing to download illegally. Also, I don't know if voice acting matters for sound? Some reviewers do it & that seems stupid because i dont think that has really anything to do with the sound MAL is referring to but in case I'm wrong, it was great. I mean,  unless you're fluent in Japanese, are Japanese, or have lived there & either A or B apply to you, you will never be able to tell truly good foreign voice acting. But not to brag, but i am entirely fluent in Japanese, he he he, due to my major, that I can honestly say the voice acting is suberb, especially by Mamoryu miyano (you may remember him from Death note as Light, so yea, pretty fucking good). 
AS for dub, I don't watch dub cause I'm not an uncultured lazy american. 
Summary: Sound good, dub is for suckers. 
Characters: Oooooooo, characters. Too many of them for such a short series. Way too many. which is funny. Cause there's like 13. Again, this is entirely due to length of series. Some characters undergo change, have opinions, feelings, (maybe like 4 or 5) etc etc but even then, their backgrounds are sporadic and few and far between, and when they do come in, they seem entirely out of place, almost like the writers were too lazy & shoved them in into a tiny opening. Then there's character you think will be important and they should be, but the 12 episode thing really fucks with them and then they're hardly given screen time. Like Kaneki(main boy) best friend. At first you're like, this nigga is about to be important. Then it's like ""You seen that orange haired bitch?) & then the complete reverse is true but only in the sense they add characters way too late that are now incredibly important. Each of which is given no backstory at all. Basically, you only ever give a fuck about a few characters & that's just on their personalities and roles in the story. Not because they're great characters. If anything, the character department of Tokyo ghoul is the worst part and is a good reason it's ranked in the 400's. 
Summary: Character's rarely given background info, thus, most suck and are either useless, become useless, or are now suddenly useful. Thanks 12 episodes. Who the fuck is in charge of these episode lengths anyway?
Enjoyment: 10/10 would bang. Also, many aspects of Tokyo ghoul are left unexplained. Because 12 episodes. (getting the theme here folks?). Many questions are raised, such as ""Wtf is the CCG?"" ""Why do ghoul parts make humans ghouls?""(yea, that's technically a spolier but it's in the first episode & you'd have to be retarded to not know that judging by, hmm, synopsis by MAL, hearsay by people comparing it to Parasyte & the fucking opening) or ""Why and where are their wards?"" and finally ""Where in the world is carmen santiago?""
Overall
All kidding aside, why did hitler kill himself? Because the jews sent him a gas bill. 
Okay, last joke. Sorry. Anyway, I would watch this show. Well i have. So You should watch this show. It's great fun & it's short(really, haven't said that before) so knock it off in 2 days like i did. Or in 1 & save the rest for masturbating. 
P.S Fuck you to all my haters who gunna say this wasn't helpful. This shit was helpful as fuck. Fuck you.",7

                I have never written a review before but seeing lots of people giving this serie good votes and hyping like crazy fangirls, I felt the urge to write.
Where should I start?
Story: 2/10 ""Pardon me?? Was there a story did I miss?"" 
Most of the episodes feels like they are arcs of themselves and have no connections at all. Plotlines just start to pop up out of nowhere and very bad written scripts don't help at all.
The last half was rushed and felt so empty. Characters were trying desperately to tell something but they failed miserably.
And for the last part it becomes like a DEUS EX
                  MACHINA thing and turns the things from gore/horror/action/drama/blabla anime to a cheap shounen shot.
Art: 4/10
The actual art is fine but the gore scenes which should be the shining star of the show are CENSORED SO BADLY that it makes you want to puke.
You will find yourself mostly watching the dark parts which is 90% of the screenplay and wonder why did they hire artists...
Sound: 5/10
Liked the Opening so much. Ending was OK. Other than that OST? WUT? NAH.
For the voice acting it was cool. I mean actors tried to act like the script was good. Poor them.
Character: 2/10
BORING.
Worst character designs ever. 
Kaneki=Yukiteru=BAD
Touka=SO BAD BEING A TSUNDERE
OTHERS=CRAP and MOST OF THEM DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE STORYLINE.
I can't express my feelings towards how badly characters could be written. You watch a couple of eps. then you will understand me.
Enjoyment: 2/10
Because it is rushed as hell and censored so badly. No. I didn't even enjoy this serie.
Overall: 3/10
I still can't get why Tokyo LOLOHUL is sooo HYPED.
And they call Sword Art bad xD",3

                This review goes for both seasons of Tokyo Ghoul (so far), and despite the fact that I don't think of Tokyo Ghoul as an anime that falls on the 'good' end of the spectrum, I will still be watching the third season. Why exactly? I don't really have a good reason. In fact, I expect to be asking myself why I am watching the third season of an anime I don't care about right up until I have finished the last episode.
* Note that I haven't read the manga, and even so, this is a review about the anime as a standalone work.
[potential minor spoilers
                  ahead]
The very first episode of Tokyo Ghoul requires a strenuous amount of suspension of disbelief and overlooking clumsy storytelling. The first episode of a show is supposed to pull you into its world in an immersive way that leaves you with many questions and wanting to find out more, not dump a whole load of information on you solely through forced dialogue. While explanation via dialogue is often necessary, especially in sci-fi/fantasy settings, there is a point at which ""show, don't tell"" really has to come into play.
Despite the over-explaining, it is still peppered with plot holes that beg for an explanation: for example, how can a knife break in half when thrust at the abdomen of a ghoul because ""human weapons can't harm ghouls"", yet a bunch of shit falling off the roof of a building can actually kill one while simultaneously leaving its organs unharmed enough to transplant? (sidenote: what was with the exchange between the doctors when they transplanted the ghoul's organs into Kaneki? I have never heard such unrealistic dialogue in my life). There are plenty of other scenes I could talk about that made me raise an eyebrow, but I don't want to spoil it for those that still intend to watch this show after my review.
What I will say in favor of the show, however, is that at times, the art and animation can be quite emotionally evocative - the soundtrack is also very good, and the art in general is smooth and well animated (aside from the incredibly annoying enormous black lines that appear in most versions of the show to block out the gore. God dammit. Gore is to me what fanservice is to others) but that's really the only genuine compliment I can think of for this show. Had it not been for these elements of it, I would absolutely have dropped it out of sheer boredom. 
The characters are very flat and seriously lack any real substance or relatability. Especially Kaneki. Though, in comparing TG to Sword Art Online and Mars of Destruction, it is a practically masterpiece in this respect. While one could protest that the fact that Kaneki basically stops being a lil bitch because the shit is tortured out of him is 'character development', I beg to differ. A 180 degree flip in a character's personality (or whatever little personality Kaneki has) over the course of one episode does not constitute realistic or interesting character development in my opinion. Even in the case of a severely traumatic event, like, for example, the shit being tortured out of you, you don't just switch from being whiney as hell one episode prior to being totally emotionless and abandoning everyone who has ever accepted you the next. Kaneki starts off as a total crybaby, before taking on a somewhat Kirito-esque Jesus-Kun aspect to him. Although there were hints of development of his character before he totally changed, it really wasn't enough to make his shift from one personality to another believable or realistic. Of course, there's always the way he is supposedly 'torn between good and evil' etc, but I have seen that premise done a thousand times better elsewhere, and with less dimensionless characters.
As for the supporting characters, none of them seemed to show any real development at all. The only character I actually got much enjoyment out of was Juuzou, and honestly, even he was a shit character. I think I like him because I'm biased towards childlike psychotic nutcases who enjoy ripping people to shreds with scythes, no matter how shittily they're written.
The characters just aren't believable or realistic. They are too black or white - even Kaneki, who is meant to play the part of grey, is too one-dimensional. The problem is that the plot doesn't leave any room for ambiguity to keep the viewer guessing, to get the viewer caught up in the turmoil of the characters. My general rule of thumb is that if you can easily summarize a character in one sentence (or god forbid, one word - eg. tsundere), the writer is probably doing something wrong.
As for the course of the plot... As far as I'm concerned, I'm not actually sure I could see that it had much direction. If you want to see the same basic concept TG follows applied in a more realistic way, I'd recommend Parasyte: The Maxim. I get the feeling that Tokyo Ghoul was trying to be somewhere between slice of life ghoul style and a dramatic thriller, and I didn't feel like it quite worked. There wasn't enough back story to most of the other ghouls in the cafe to make it possible to really keep track of what the hell was going on, especially towards the end of season 2.
I suppose, what I have to say about Tokyo Ghoul is that it tried. I mean, it managed to hold my attention, and it wasn't completely unwatchably idiotic and putrid. It was a good time killer at least, and a small part of me vaguely looks forward to seeing the third season.",4
"
                It set up really well to then leave the scene, and give the spotlight to the angsty pizza boy.
The show started out looking promising but failed to keep a good pacing. It gave one of the most forced and painfully pretentious protagonists I've seen. 
It keeps trying to convince you you should like him, although his timid and naive nature is just too unconvincing. The show then wants you to believe his Jesus transformation syndrome, which is a thing that's always really corny but it's done really poorly here by not even having the story events really arc into this transformation and character development. Which
                  comes off as (a thing very common in anime) the creator's self-insertion. When you can't mistake the feeling, of the artist trying very hard to live out his fantasy through a fictional character in their own personal project. Usually this character will come off as lacking depth or any sort of realistic reaction to what happens around them. Which leaves the viewer with a feeling that they're just looking at someone's personal ego boosting. This protagonist is the big problem, but sadly not the only problem.
Tokyo Ghoul started out really well. It had an interesting idea and a first episode that really paced itself well. It was shrouded in mystery that gave you the sense of ""All will soon be revealed to you"". All was indeed revealed. With little to no fanfare whatsoever. It was explained in a manner as if what is going on here is as normal as drinking your morning coffee. And it comes off with the message that they're just different, and you shouldn't hate others for being different. Insert a whiney ""Don't judge me!"" here. The show really hammers in how pretentious it is, and I'm pretty sure the writers are completely unaware of it.
There was something of potential here, there really was. But it casts away society and the general public view on this problem of ghouls living in the city. After the first episodes it all shrinks into this really small world. Just a couple of small groups of people, and gives the spotlight completely to characters that are frankly not strong enough to carry the show home. It would really have been nice if the show had kept consistent for one thing, but even more importantly, treated its premise with care. It starts out like it should, addressing the existence of ghouls as a problem to society. But it shrugs it off and just becomes small gang skirmishes... and barely even. We don't get any reason to why the ghouls even exist. There's no endeavor to make the viewer actually care about what's happening. This should've had a bigger plot. It's just a series of small forgettable events, and no plot.
Its art style is pretty nice... the animation is pretty good too. Nothing amazing but it's good enough. What I really think is done well in Tokyo Ghoul is lighting. Lighting, shading and character outlines. The voice acting isn't really anything to critize either.
The opening sequence was decent with a decent song, but the real feast, is the ending sequence, that sets a tone the show in general should've tried to mimic. The songs fit the aesthetic really well.
So to sum it up. Tokyo Ghoul had something going for it. If it had just treated its premise with better care. But the main problem is an extremely lacking protagonist that steals the show, but has nothing to show for it.",3
"
                Ken Kaneki is a shy young man who lives an ordimary college life.Due to an unexpected turn of events his fate is bound to change overnight.From the lonely world of books is thrown into the mysterious world of ""ghouls"".At first he is in denial and cannot accept his ""nature"" believing he is still a human, but hunger now blinds him.It is only after he meets Touka that he realises life goes on. Touka is young ghoul in protection of a group of less violent ghouls who try to live well with humans.Ken gradually becomes a member.Joy and tragedies he experience as a ghoul will grow
                  him up and direct him to abandon them.
I was amazed by the connection of colours with the mood of Ken and the other characters(sad,angry--->rain, happy,enjoyment--->sunny day).Also the presence of art diversity in characters was clear(face, clothes,hair) as well as details in the background (cars, traffic lights,buildings).Battles were okay(i've seen better ones) but thats fair because i think Tokyo ghoul focuses more on Ken's drama than ghoul action sequences.
Honestly,i didnt like the opening theme.The ending is catchy thought.I was not that impressed with the sound i must say.
Ken's dramatic character evolutes well(happy,shy,introverted to lonely,sad,angry and backwards).There is a gap on drawing the other ""main"" characters like Amon,Touka,Hinami but i believe is part of focusing more on Ken.
I really enjoyed watching Tokyo Ghoul and i recommend it to all anime lovers  especially those who prefer the plot and drama with a spice of mystery and action.",9
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is an anime that would satisfy your craving for suspense. The lack of character development and the unconvincing plot is the downside but the action sequences and the art makes up for that. At the very least, it is enjoyable.
Story - 7/10
The plot started out good enough. The fast-pace format of the first episode then the slow pace format of the succeeding ones are actually beneficial at least for the first three episodes. And although it is only twelve episodes long, watching the third quarter (7-9) is really hard for me because of my diminishing interest in the anime as a whole. Nonetheless
                  episodes 10-11 are quite good and the last episode had great moments but nothing more. What I meant truly meant to say, is that the series never really regained the momentum that it gave during its first few episodes and although the last episodes tried to reach that, for me, it didn't work. Also, I know there is a second season but they should have made the ending better. Great endings are after all what constitutes a great anime.
Art - 9/10
At least the animation was good, I could say that. There never really was a dip in the quality and the action sequences were spectacular. Minute details in facial expression were beautifully done. I however do not like the censoring and even some scenes that were done in ""negative"" shots, to possibly make the gore at least pleasing to the eye which they shouldn't have done. They should have known better that the people that would probably watch this would crave those, and expect more of gore and blood but to deprive them of that is absurd.
Sound - 9/10
Very nice OP and ED but somewhat not remarkable. The score during the fighting scenes, or just dramatic scenes however were majestic.
Character - 5/10
The characters are thinly drawn. Although there are some moments of greatness such as the relationship between Kaneki and Hide, or the inner goodness of Touka but other than that, there is really no other complexity of relationships between the characters. There is your standard bad guy that turns tolerable, the seemingly weak girl that actually has a super strong power, etc. All of them just became stereotypical. It could have been better if the series was longer at least a few more episodes highlighting more of the stories of these characters for us to actually get attached to them. In this case, I even forgot the names of some supporting characters
Enjoyment - 8/10
It is a very enjoyable anime. It did satisfy my craving for suspense and a little bit of horror. I hated the ending though. (Spoiler alert!) I guess a few scenes of torture is okay but going on for a few episodes is very intolerable, that I had to skip some parts of that. 
Overall - 7/10
A good anime to watch and somewhat better than average. Some parts of it may turn off viewers like it did to me. I do however, respect the fandom that it generated and I guess it deserved it. However, this is not a class A anime. But if you are looking for an anime that you would at least enjoy and be thrilled about, then Tokyo Ghoul is the anime for you.",7
"
                I am going to start off by saying that no anime is perfect. everyone has a favorite(s) series, but even then the viewer will find faults. I will follow this statement by saying that Tokyo Ghoul is also not perfect. I will also say that it is one heck of a series. The music is beautiful. the opening theme is by far the best and can make you want to do the impossible. the character voices and development were casted and executed perfectly for this thrilling horror. Unlike many other horrors (cough cough deadman wonderland) the entire thing is not filled with pointless amounts of
                  blood, guts, and agonizing screams. You will develop an emotional bond in some way or another to Kaneki Ken, even if it doesn't occur till the season finale. I don't know how to describe Kaneki ken other then saying that he is every characteristic rolled into one. he has a part of him that everyone can relate to. whether it be his nerdy book lover side, his badass white  haired  he-did-not-deserve-this- side, his cannibalistic insect of horror side, or his team mom side shown in Tokyo Ghoul:re, everyone can relate to the poor kid. 
What is bothering most people about this series, is the fact that if you did not read the manga the series becomes VERY CONFUSING. characters start popping up out of the blue and mean nothing to the actual plot of the anime! Also, if all else fails Kaneki will either be found smiling or crying. THERE IS NO IN BETWEEN. also after season one, the anime parts ways from the manga and does not have any similarities until the final battle. NOTHING THAT HAPPENS IS SEASON 2 IS RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!! it bugs me to no end. 
The reason I am rating this so high is because the entire series (anime and manga) are amazing. yes its not perfect but its definitely worth wasting your time on! it will always be my favorite series. PLEASE WATCH THIS ANIME!!!!! but if all else fails.......
READ THE FREAKING MANGA YOU WEEABOOS",8

                *This review covers both seasons, and contains spoilers.*
This show was terrible. I guess I was expecting a lot going into this anime, and I wanted to like it so badly but every time I think about it I just can't. I might have mixed up this show and Tokyo Ghoul Root A in this review but I hope you can overlook that because I see them as the same show. I guess I'll do this review systematically as well just to be fair.
Story: 1/10
I guess it started off with a pretty good idea, but the farther I got into the story the less faith I
                  had in it. I'm trying hard to be as blunt as possible here but it really made very little sense. Characters would go somewhere for a very vague reason and at the end of the arch it would still be unclear what they were doing there and what had been accomplished. Kagune's and Quinques were not explained at all, and there was no development in the origin of ghouls; there was just a deficiency of reason in anything that happened in the plot.
I am not the kind of person who likes fighting in anime because it doesn't progress the plot or character development or anything really. Fighting needs to have a really high quality of animation like what we see in  Fate/Stay Night or martial art style like Avatar for me to enjoy it. Tokyo Ghoul's fighting animation really didn't impress me and there was quite a lot of it, which left me with a lot of moments thinking about what they were doing and if that scene needed to be that long. The scenes had a painfully low amount of frames, and it made me cringe how badly they were animated.
My other piece of criticism with the fighting is that it really doesn't match the theme of ghouls very much, who I thought were supposed to be hidden among the masses of Tokyo, and expected something much more like a ""wolf among us"" kind of violence. Instead it was a hack and smash, storm-trooper level accuracy gunfight. There was one part that still bothers me to this day (SPOILER).
(SPOILER) Amon, a squishy human with a melee weapon, is fighting two ghouls, who are supposedly knife proof, super fast, have teeth that can rip a man apart, and have tails that can also rip a man apart. Two ghouls. One man. Amon suddenly has a flashback to something his teacher says: ""in a toe to toe battle, a human will always lose to a ghoul. So be sly. Be sneaky."" With that being said (remembered, thought, whatever) Amon reveals that his sword can split in half and he defeats each ghoul with each sword. How could a squishy man defeat two ghouls with close range weapons in the middle of a losing fight? Secondly you're already in the fight, it's already too late to be sneaky. Sneaky is dressing an animal up in your clothes and releasing it as you make your getaway to make the enemy think you transformed. Sneaky is wading underwater breathing through a blow gun with a poison blow dart until twilight and assassinating their ass while they're drinking tea under the gazebo. Sneaky is covering yourself in a rock shaped blanket and waiting to shank their ass when they least expect it. In no way is splitting your sword in two sneaky. (SPOILER END)
(SPOILER END)
I'm sorry for digressing so much but that part just made no sense and it still bothers me just thinking about it. I have a feeling it's meant to be a long anime like Naruto or One Piece so they thought they had time to answer questions in the future, but they just left me confused and now I'm not going to watch that far. I spent way too much time being confused by the story of this anime.
Art: 3/10
I'll say this right at the beginning: the style of this anime was amazingly good. The dark, night-lit Tokyo where ghouls with awesome kagune's lurk in the shadows left a good impression on me when the title of the show appeared during the theme song. I was completely enchanted by the idea of ghouls, their cool looking masks fighting special police forces.
But the drawing was a complete let down. The characters were crudely drawn, the frame rate was painfully low, the extras were not believable. 
The style and the idea was mind-blowing, but the execution was terrible. I chose this rating because it has the word that best describes my impression of the art: poor. Giving this rating makes me sad that I don't like this show.
Sound: 10/10
The theme songs were absolutely mind-blowing. The lyrics, genre and sound were all appropriate to the show. The sound during the show was not really that impressive, but the opening and closing themes were good enough to pull my rating to a 10. Even if you don't watch the anime, it's worth it to check them out.
Character: 3/10
I really didn't like Kaneki. He was so stupid and a lot of the time I was wondering how he was still alive. He's a ghoul but doesn't want to eat meat. I understand you don't want to eat your own kind, but I'm sorry if you don't eat you die, and you should be dead. Same with Amon. I see that he is insanely buff and manly, but there is no excuse that he should be able to fend off a lightning fast centipede kagune who is literally balls to the wall bat-shit crazy, can smell the sweat on your balls while you can't even see in the smoke, can rip your throat out with his toenails, while you're only wielding two little sticks. 
Putting stupid characters who really should be dead aside, there were a bunch of characters that left me wondering: why are you here? Examples being Touka's bffl, Kaneki's bffl, every member of Aogiri Tree, half the members of Anteiku, and last but not least, pretty much everyone on the police force. These characters have zero development, serve as pretty much filler in the plot, and do absolutely nothing except get crudely drawn.
Enjoyment: 3/10
I did enjoy parts of Tokyo Ghoul like how each ghoul had a different kagune and different mask, and there was a moment that nearly touched my heart when they showed us that ghouls had feelings too, but the next rating level was called ""decent"" and I'm afraid this show fell short of that.
Overall: 2/10
""Dreadful"" is a great word for me to describe this with. As much as I wanted to enjoy this show, I was let down. For those of you who rated it highly I wish I could see what you see. I even watched Root A hoping it would get better but I wasted my time. Don't watch this show unless you want to support crappy work.",2
"
                Tokyo Ghoul's anime seems to be a beautiful adaptation of the manga I didn't read. The graphics and the soundtrack are really beautiful, the atmosphere is rhythmic and a little anxious, the actions are fluid.
For the storyline, this anime is only the first part of the story. I'm watching the second season and I don't thus judge the whole work. This first season is rather quiet. The first episodes explain us perfectly the principle and the context in which the story takes place. The end is much gorier - without spoiler nobody- and it is the moment which I preferred. We see the evolution of
                  the psychology of the main character and the others. That is what I expect from this kind of work.
I would say that this first season can be considered as a kind of ""prologue"" which introduces the second season which seems to be even better.",7
"
                They take the manga and completely destroys the anime adaption. This show would have been so much better if it gotten a 24-26 episodes to start with which was to bad that it didn`t because  the manga is actually pretty good in my opinion. 
So i really recommend that you watch the anime first and then read the manga from start otherwise if you read the manga and then watch the adaption you will be hugely disappointed. Sorry for being so negative but its really hard to be positive when one of your favorite mangas get one of the worst anime adaptions.

                ""Tokyo Ghoul"" is an anime of the year 2014 based on the eponymous manga Sui Ishida.
The anime has a plot is not very attractive, in the sense that immediately attracts the viewer, or at least that is what I thought I, the person who likes splatter. The picture presents many problems, both technical and in terms of plot and presentation of the latter.
The plot: we are in a Tokyo where over humans in everyday life there are the ""ghoul"", the ""ghoul"" are and are not human beings, let me explain better, but they are humans with no human characteristics resistance as well above average, regeneration
                  capacity and beyond, not deepen to avoid ending up in spoiler. And it is in this reality that the souls takes place. The protagonist Ken Kaneki will one day to flounder from being human to ghoul and here begins the story of the anime.
The plot has trouble setting level or there are parts very, very boring like the dialogue in ""Cafè Anteiku"" between the characters that are really unnecessary and boring parts, such as fighting, that could have been better but were a hole in the water. What this leads to is largely the poor quality of the animations from the studio Pierrot who not only organized the evil souls but also produced animations of high level at all; one of the reasons why many people are found to suspend the series, and I'd be lying if I said that I'm not even I was tempted but in the end I decided to go on, but you will be back after this speech.
The characters are not at all to remember with the typical protagonist ""mollaccione"" Kaneki, the typical girl strong and tough on the outside but tender and fragile inside, Touka, and various characters among which you could save Hide, friend of the protagonist, However, that has almost no importance in the history and conduct of the anime.
The technical sector as mentioned above is not the best with little animations cured and sometimes unnatural, but not too much to luck. As already stated before this is a big problem because a person from an anime of 2014 expects graphics and animations done in a certain way, certainly not perfect, but even rough. The voice acting is really poorly done except for the dubbing of Kaneki that is made well enough. The fund sound is bad and almost always annoying and does not help to give depth to the scenes, you can save but the opening that is cute.
Completed the review I can say that I do not recommend these souls especially to lovers of souls horror, splatter because most likely remain disappointed and instead I can say to those who do not fit the above categories to see it only if you have no more to see in the list.
Final score: 1.",1
"
                After months away from the series leaving myself the last 2 episodes, I finally decided to go back and finish watching Tokyo Ghoul, and I'm really happy I did. I do think that all the hate it got is not hard to understand because people expected so much and felt let down. I would also like to mention that I have read the manga and do agree that as a whole it is much better than the anime series, but I still very much enjoyed watching it. 
I think that most of TG's problems arise from the attempt at squeezing what is a well-paced longer
                  story into a 12 episode program. This caused the pacing issues and the seemingly out of nowhere decisions and character development. You are thrown into a lot of what happens as opposed to being eased into it. 
Story:
Tokyo Ghoul is about protagonist Kaneki Ken becoming very involved with ghouls. Ghouls are human-esque entities that are just like us... except they live off of only human flesh and the occasional cuppa joe. So they're monsters? The bad guys? ...that's the grey area that Tokyo Ghoul explores. What is bad anyway? These are the kind of questions you find yourself asking when you realise that many times their actions are simply the result of circumstance. The premise of the show intrigued me right off the bat and I knew I was in for a ride (albeit a rocky one here and there).

The art is great. The action sequences were beautifully animated. Many complains were about the unnecessary censorship, which I completely agree was pretty ridiculous but the uncensored version it out so yeah. 
Sound:
I thought the soundtrack was very fitting and that OP is amazing. Coupled with the animation, that OP is definitely one of my favourites, it really put you in the mood for something epic. 
Character:
I think the reason it's harder to have a connection with the characters and understand why they do certain things is because there wasn't enough time for the creators to flush them out due to how rushed the story was. 
Overall, Tokyo Ghoul was pretty enjoyable. Wasn't as great as we knew it could've been, but it was fun. It may have felt like important build up was amiss but the ending was pretty satisfying and convinced me to check out season 2. If you are still unsure whether its for you, I'd recommend you check out the first few episodes and see for yourself, it could be hit or miss.",7
"
                In overall it's not an anime I'd would want to buy or watch over and over again, except for a few specific scenes. To me this adaptation feels like an insult to the manga and for the loyal fans of Tokyo Ghoul.
Episode one was fine, it can give you the impression that it's worth to try but afterwards it goes down hill. Too many character get thrown into the story too fast most of them get neglected until later on, which makes you wonder why the hell they introduced the characters so early.
Second the characterisation is well, terrible. While the manga shows Kaneki quite
                  sharp on certain situations; like during the restaurant when he noticed something was strange with the coffee and already was wondering if it was a trap; in the anime he just walks into Tsukiyama's trap without any second thoughts. At least in the manga Kaneki had a reason for entering the restaurant. Another important note Hinami: Despite being still young she was able to pick up danger with just her nose, in the anime she just runs into a trap, also without second thought... great job girl; you're 13 not 6 use your brain for a while.
Also I found the scene with Yamori visiting Hinami's father to get his new torture object very pointless and having Mado and Amon on his heels didn't do any justice to it. 
But if you just ignore or skip all the annoying useless talk and pointless complicated plot of the anime and watch only the fighting scenes, you'll probably like it, if you don't mind not knowing what's going on.
If you're just beginning to get into manga and anime I advice you to watch it, since the more experienced fans will be more fond of characterization and plot and for the fans who are already familiar with the manga, only episode 8 and 12 are worth watching.

                I've watched this anime several times over, completed the manga and am up-to-date on the current Manga and airing season before deciding to write this. This will be my first review I've ever written but i see Tokyo Ghoul as being something really worth doing this for. 
Story- 8/10 -  The story is well written and they do a great job taking from the manga, obviously things are gonna get left out or the time of an event may change but nothing to truly ruin or change the original story line. It stays enjoyable through its entirety, Throughout the series it has some very
                  graphic parts that give it the horror feel but it's still a very enjoyable watch even for people not super into gore.
Art -  9/10 - The art is fantastic, not just the character's but the scenery as well. The different ghoul's kagune look awesome in color and motion ( especially Tohka's).
Sound - 10/10 - The music for this is just amazing i really cant praise it enough. The intro is the perfect song for this series, TK from Ling Tosite Sigure has a very unique sound to him and it just fits so well with this dark and unique story.
Character- 8/10 - The characters in this all have very unique personality's that you get to experience,They all become rather lovable , even the bad guys, While Kaneki may be the main character you really get a feel for a lot of the cast, who they are, what they like to do, their past, it feels like you're watching over a city as it's story about ghouls and investigators  unfolds and not just watching 1 character go through life and the struggles that come with it.
Enjoyment - 9/10 - I personally really enjoyed this, enough to watch it several times over. The story is intriguing and there isn't a lot of filler like some anime's have. With only 12 episodes to work with in this season they did a great job keeping it interesting and moving the story along at a decent pace.
Overall this is a really great anime, i recommended reading the manga first then moving onto this and the next season so you can really get the full experience of what the author has to tell. I did my best to not do any spoilers ( which is tough cause i totally want to rant about this explaining why i rate this so high among everything i've seen, but no spoilers for you!)",9

                Here is my review for the fairly new anime Tokyo Ghoul. 
Story - 6 
It is a alright story, I have seen similar such as Shiki where the shiki have to drink blood of humans thus having shikis and humans co-exist but not like the ghouls that people already know about and actually eat human flesh not just blood. After watching the latest (and last) episode, it is hard to give the anime anything higher since there are plot holes. 
Art - 9
Well done on art, it has nice vivid colors that truly stand out from others. Such as the way the hair colors stand
                  out, not to mention other details they go into with backgrounds. 
Sound - 7
Opening is very nice, one of my favorites but not much liking for the ending theme. OST is done nicely, not really the best but certainly not the worst. Enough to keep the mood.
Character - 6
Main character has the typical bad past like most do where his parents are dead or something tragic happened. There hardly is any character development especially since there only 12 episodes. Although I seen short animes with good development. Anyways, characters are made fair enough where the viewer will either like or dislike them.
Enjoyment - 9
I was always looking forward to seeing the next episode and during the waiting period for next episode to air was painful, lol. 
Overall - 7 
A good anime that should at least be given a try despite not being absolutely perfect. It is probably a good idea to read the manga too (I plan to do that) which is 100+ chapters which will satisfy more :)",7
"
                One of my many not-so-popular opinions is that this is one of the greatest ""tame horror"" animes of all time.
The first thing that caught me was the music. The title sequence and the song 'Unravel' are both beautiful, and masterfully expel a mild eerie feeling, not too much to deter the average anime watcher from continuing, but still enough to let you know that it's gonna get creepy.
The second thing that caught me is that even though this is a pretty gory anime, massive or obscene amounts of blood or gore are usually blacked out. You may be thinking, ""well any horror cartoon can censor""..
                  but personally, the animation style and the characters reactions to the horror in front of them is so much more subtle and, well terrifying in some cases if you're not de-sensitised to horror by now. 
As much as I praise this series for it's creepy art, great music and animation style.. Some of the characters are just so dull. Although, sometimes this isn't such a bad thing, as the majority of the time it plays into the whole ""emotionally exhausted"" vibe that a lot of the characters give off. As great as that is, it does stunt the development of the story in the emotional aspect, which slows the anime down a bit. I didn't really see that as a bad thing though, but I know it annoys some people.
The main thing is, I absolutely love this anime. Mostly because of it's atmosphere and it's masterful use of censorship to tone down the gore. I'd really recommend this to people who are smack bang in the middle of the ""scary scale"" when it comes to fear factor.
For people who loved Deathnote, got enjoyably freaked out by Future Diary/Mirai Nikki, but aren't ready for the likes of Corpse Party or Deadman Wonderland. I'd recommend this to people who love outright gore and mildly psychopathic characters, but absolutely hate jump-scares like I do.",10
"
                What I am about to write below is more of a biased personal view than a Review, but its spoiler free so it got it going for it which is nice.
This anime is a lot like a highstudent's research papers - brilliant start, outstanding ending , and everything else filled with copypasted fillers.
It starts great, action, enchanting characters and then , just after first episode it takes a turn to a tedious boring drama and then again gets really good at the very end. Just like certain series - you start watching them,  understand how much crap they are and start  wondering why
                  you still watch it , and then they leave you with a cliffhanger and you start craving for the next season.
Long story short- just watch first and last episode, unless you don't mind watching anime about secondary characters full of fillers and tedious plots about weak ordinary schoolboys.",4
"
                I don't understand why it's so fucking hard to get an action show that's consistently entertaining. Of all the programmes I watched, Tokyo Ghoul is probably one of the few shows that actually made me feel like I was wasting my time watching it. ""Oh, why didn't you drop it?"" you might ask? Well for starters, I was actually following the programme as it was airing at the time (fun fact: I actually had the most upvoted preview at the time, but it got taken down because the show finished airing). But that isn't enough to truly explain why I so viscerally despise Tokyo Ghoul.
                  Yeah, this show was beaten into the ground but I still got pent-up feelings of frustration that I need to vent.
I think the biggest reason as to why I fucking hate Tokyo Ghoul is because of how often it denied me my greatest pleasure as an anime viewer: intense action brimming with blood and broken bones. The first episode starts off with a ghoul feeding and then escaping, then it cuts to a REALLY nice opening sequence which then further sets the mood and I was just thinking to myself ""aw yeah, this is gonna be awesome!"" but then guess what happens? It cuts to some punk kid getting ready for his blind date and it isn't until half-way through the episode when we find out that his date was a ghoul. The ghoul tries to eat him, they get into an accident at some construction site, shit happens, and now the punk has the ghoul organs inside him. You know what that means, right? MORE BULLSHIT THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF THE ACTION!
A recurring theme of the show is Kaneki's struggle to accept his new ghoul status. He happens across a pair of benevolent ghouls who ease him through this transition but even so, Kaneki still wants to mope about. You see, I wouldn't really have such a problem with this but Kaneki isn't likeable in my book. This mostly stems for the fact that I've got a /VERY/ deep-seated resentment built-up toward Shinji Ikari clones and Kaneki certainly fits the bill and then some: he's a punk kid forcibly brought into a life-altering situation and now has to shoulder the burdens of this new life. It also helps that his female sidekick, Tohka has purple hair just like Misato and tries to get him settled in. Great...
On top of this, the whole reason why Kaneki's life got flipped, turned upside-down is mind-numbingly retarded when you think about what actually happened to him: the guy was on the verge of dying and he ends up getting the organs of his would-be murderer (who is also a ghoul) transplanted into him. So you mean to tell me that there is NO screening process to see whether or not someone is a ghoul, let alone whether or not an organ came from a human or a ghoul even though humans and ghouls have coexisted since time immemorial? Also, how is it that the ghoul's organs could've been transplanted into Kaneki so easily? Assuming that ghouls and humans have nearly identical physiologies (which is already a fucking asinine assumption to make because ghouls are man-eaters that can mutate at whim), how is it that the ghoul and Kaneki would have the same blood type or whatever it is that keeps a transplanted organ from getting rejected? The list of holes in the story get bigger and bigger, but I think I've made my point.
Now you may be thinking to yourself ""oh, why overthink this show?"" or ""why do you have to bring real world logic into this?"" Well guess what? This show is quite possibly the furthest thing from entertaining possible. I can tolerate the annoying main character and his bitching to some extent and I can let the gaps in logic slide provided that the show is entertaining enough to override my critical faculties. Unfortunately, this show just LOVES to deny me my fix of fast-paced action filled to the brim with all kinds of blood, guts, broken bones, and all that good shit! For almost 17 minutes of every 20 minute episode, we gotta put up with Kaneki's bitching, boring talking scenes involving the ghoul enforcement squad or whatever it's called, etc and then we get a few minutes of Kaneki tapping into the power of Ghoul ex Machina and then we see him using his magic ghoul powers to make pizza sauce and not much else. On top of that, the censorship was absolutely appalling when it was airing. The entire screen's colour palette would be inverted for 1-2 minutes at a time, and all that was being censored was just Kaneki stabbing the latest villain who's impossible to take seriously with his magic ghoul tentacles. Yeah, censorship's a non-issue now that the Blu-rays are out but that still doesn't erase what happened.
By the end of it all, there's a lot of shit that can be said about Ghoul and most of it sure as hell ain't gonna be pleasant from me. The only thing that's keeping this show from being so bad that it shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence that barrels are in is the fact that it's got some pretty colours and a nice OST to it. The only value that this abysmal excuse for a show has is snark bait. Now if you just so happen to unironically enjoy this programme, good on ya. You're able to do something I clearly can't do. Maybe the manga will be much better than this piece of crap but given the EXTREMELY sour taste that the anime left in my mouth, I can't really say that I'll give the manga a shot. Anyway, that's all for now. Feedback's welcome and all that guff, so I'm out. Peace :)

                Tokyo Ghoul is a very curious case in that it is probably the only series that fails to deliver only because it is not violent enough. Its whole world has a rather dark and brutal feel to it. Or a least that's what it tries to convey: the expression of the characters are most of the time distorted; everyone has a really sad past involving numerous deaths; and almost all of them have some mental disorder thanks to the fact that they have to live on the edge of society for being ghouls. The main character and his friends try to find their place by
                  forming a group that keeps them out of trouble. It makes them the most reasonable of their kind but even they are really messed up.
You think it would not be hard to sympathize or at least understand such tragic souls but they are so boringly written that it just makes them annoying, especially Kaneki. I get it, it is cool that he starts out as a whining loser to later become a big badass, but both of his personalities are so stereotypical anime tropes lacking anything new that the way they overemphasize his pain just makes it really tiresome. And it is more or less true for every character, especially because the adaptation feels very rushed and so they have very little time for development.  
For a long time I just didn't get why this story doesn't work, but the last episode made me accept the reasoning of the manga-readers: it is way too censored compared to manga. The last scene in the anime is just so brutal that even this toned down version succeeds at giving you a feeling the anime should have given from the start. The feeling of becoming totally lost that can only be dispelled by going out of your way. 
If you want to show something that can make even the most sane man crazy you really need to try because there have already been many anime that shows you real desperation (Shingeki no Kyojin, Claymore, etc.). In many cases violence is just a tool to make things more exciting. But Tokyo Ghoul just doesn't have anything else that makes this craziness and sadness believeable.   
The best part of the show is its incredible opening. That’s how the whole series should have felt like.",5
"
                The best thing about this anime is the mystery and the dark vibe in the atmosphere. I always enjoy when there are different sides to a story. How each sides have different views of justice, but the bottom line is that we're not much different from the prejudices and stereotypes we all hate so much. One cannot judge everyone in the same category. It's like saying: ""many black people are criminals, therefore, all black people are criminals"". I liked that message, I found it intriguing. 
This show lacks in character development, the story feels rushed (though it IS only 12 episodes), they censor a great
                  deal of bloody and violent scenes, which I found quite annoying, and the different special powers each ghoul has is stunningly cool looking, but each ability isn't as unique as I wanted them to be. Overall it's a good anime to kill time, but it'll easily vanish away from my memories as the years go by. Nothing memorable, in other words.",6
"
                Tokyo Ghoul, the masterpiece written by Ishda sensei was adapted into an anime by Studio Pierrot in 12eps. The 12eps was the reason why it was rushed, why it was slammed by the manga-readers. But this review is with respect to the anime only and not comparing it to the manga.
Story: 8
 The story is unique and finds you within two worlds, the humans and the ghouls. Through the eyes of our MC we see who are the real villains... not the humans nor the ghouls but the ones who are truly bad at heart. The story is not very complex but definitely
                  has alot of depth.
Art: 8
 The only thing Ishda's masterpiece lacked in the start was the art which got better and better as the manga progressed. But here in the anime, the color palette used, the animation and the character sketches are really well done and this one of the big positives. The 'kagune' of the ghouls also looked cool. The art would have got a 10 from my side but the unnecessary censorship got it a '-2'. But be sure to get the BD versions because they are uncensored and definitely will not annoy you.
Sound: 9
I have nothing to say about the sound. The opening, 'unravel' by TK was really well done and I found the the ending song enjoyable too. 
The voice acting in fact was a very strong point in the series.
Character:5
This is where the anime fails. Very rushed and all the important plot points in the manga were skipped or not properly dealt with and caused the huge cast of characters who had the potential of character development, had almost nothing. *SPOILER* The MC, Ken Kaneki has a huge character development towards the end of the series but the poor execution of sequences which lead to the development made it look meh.
Enjoyment: 8
I will say this. If I had not read the manga, I would have enjoyed this series a lot. It's not that the adaptation is terrible, the manga itself is too good in my opinion",8

                Tokyo ghoul is a horror?
..
First of all don't expect a good story around it, OK it has a kind of good story but don't expect it to deliver something good, which is what it supposed to do, but they failed hard.
Let's see what i expected from the first episode and what i got from the anime, i expected a good story, then i knew it'll be a hyped up anime of how the first episode went. 
After that the rest of the Eps came over the weeks and every week is worse, they didn't make much of progress and started to kill random people so
                  the main character all he does is watching what's happening which means HE'S USELESS.
And then they gave us a rush ending which I'm not a fan of. 
The anime considered a mystery genre at MAL! you know why? i really don't know why too.
I didn't get the experience i wanted, they censored so much stuff in fights that it hurts to watch.
Story: 
Is about Kaneki he's half ghoul and half human, he can't get along with what ghouls do, which is eating people! but he got along with ghouls and became a friend with them. So what we saw after that they didn't know WTF they should do they got lost in what Kaneki wants and they kept into giving us BS episodes. i give it 5/10
Art and sounds: 
The way they censored everything about cutting people, made it harder to watch the anime, and it wasn't something special. But the opening and ending songs is just great and really liked it. I give the art 3/10 and the sounds 8/10.
Characters and enjoyment:
What a bad experience i had with the characters they deleted them all in the last episode and they just gave 0 F*cks about them, yeah Kaneki is a bad character he's just lost, till the last episode came and got his shit together to finish the anime only. They forgot about the rest it was just Kaneki trying to survive the whole show.
Do you want a good character development? just kill the little girl's dad and mom! loved this idea from them. Enjoyment didn't actually deliver that to me. So characters is 2/10 and enjoyment is 2/10
Overall i give it 4/10, i didn't get much excited about what will happen over the course of watching the anime and everything turned into a fail try from this anime.",4
"
                This series has potential to become one of the best anime's in recent memory if it gets a few more seasons. In fact, I think that the plot is thick enough here to warrant many more seasons. Season 1 does a excellent job setting the context and introducing us to the characters. It would be a shame if Tokyo Ghoul ended after just 24 episodes Including Re . If you fail to reach the midpoint of the first season, you will judge this series inaccurately based on limited data. If you make it to the midpoint, however, you will have that epiphany you've been searching
                  for and the show will appear before you in a new light, as it has to me.
This show has great character depth and animation and was pretty hectic with the violence and despair. But it was also censored to pieces and the ending was vague. The second season may clarify some things
Don't judge this series based on the manga; they're totally different artforms and should be judged separately. It seems to me that a lot of people who negatively judge this series are extremely biased in favor of the manga, and that's just unreasonable.",9
"
                ~~ This review contain spoiler ~~
       I think that the zombie reinvention in Tokyo Ghoul is, quite frankly, disturbing. I mean, wow, zombies with sentience... Great. Which makes the series interesting to watch actually because it will make you believe that all is lost for humankind etc. EXCEPT (spoiler alert) there are humans that can go neck and neck with these mostrosities. Shocking, right?
        Now, all is well and good and until episode 10, I thought that I can rate this series 7.5 (or maybe a solid 8 at the highest), but
                  then that's where I realized that the pacing was off. No offense to the amount of effort put into the first 10 episodes, but episode 12 just has SO MUCH impact, that I've watched it nearly as many times as Shougo Makishima's death scene. In my honest opinion, producer should've stretched the ending out more and cut the Doves' screen time.
         The other thing that made me like the series less is the fact that after all his griping and suffering, the protag got an epic power boost, again, in the bitter end. And I think that the importance of his being a hybrid is overshadowed by the fact that he was kidnapped... Wow. There should've been more substance to his character (and Hide's too) but there isn't much that can be done in 12 episodes.
         For the plus points: powerful opening song by TK, who coincidentally sung Psycho Pass' op. Unravel's mood actually matches the mood of the entire series. (The ed is laid back, but still pretty memorable). So, without further ado, I rate this ANIME (without iiinfluece from the manga) a 7.",7
"
Some Spoilers Ensue:
Wow...that finale....I needed a few minutes after it ended. This show was brilliant. The genre of 'zombie' or what have you is extremely overdone right now, so a show coming out about ghouls who eat humans didn't seem like it would be that good. I was happily proven wrong about that. This is considered horror, and it is, which is refreshing since it's tough to find horror anime. Also, I love that this show didn't hold back on the character deaths and psychological turmoil, especially that which was inflicted on poor Kaneki in the last episodes. It was delivered well, and added a
                  huge shock factor to the show. Next to Book Of Circus, this is my favorite anime this summer.
Story: Ghouls are able to only eat one person per month, and live well...but there is one person who has been binge eating and causing problems in Tokyo. From that opening, we are treated to an interesting and action/horror packed ride through the world of ghouls. Some are heartless, some are funny, and some are loving. The beauty of the story is the fact that you don't know the outcome for any specific character. All can change. The reveals and plot twists were excellent and I was hooked from the first episode.
Animation: what can I say? It is definitely gorgeous to watch. The ghouls are interesting to look at as are all their different powers. The visuals throughout were lovely, however I would have liked to see more gore...but you're listening to a horror conesuer talking here.
Sound: outstanding...just wonderful voice acting especially from Kaneki. There's a scene at the beginning where he has just been turned ghoul and he bites into his favorite burger and starts crying...it gave me chills. The ending as well during all of the torture, he was just amazing to listen to as he went through all that horror. The theme song is one of my favorites of late as well and I highly recommend the amazing OST.
Characters: From jump, Kaneki was well developed. He is loveable and naive which are qualities that sometimes hinder the character, but not here because his dark side is also beautiful. Rize and Jason along with any other opposing villains were also very 3 dimensional causing the viewer tho harbor extreme love or hate towards any of them. I don't so much like Toka (just my preference) but am fond of Nishiki and definitely Tsukiyama. Villain or not, they are super interesting.
Overall, I hope they are going to do another season because I loved this show, but for now, I'll try to mend my feels.
8.5/10 Watched Subbed.",8

                I started Tokyo Ghoul without knowing what to expect. All I knew about it came from short little briefs on what it's about. I had heard nothing but rave reviews so I decided I should check it out; needless to say, I'm glad I did. 
The concept itself of Tokyo Ghoul was incredible to me -- ""Ghouls"", people-like monsters who need human flesh to survive -- but that's just the basis. What they made this concept was what really captivated me. Keneki begins as a naive, good-hearted boy; and, unlike many other series, his transformation is much more realistic. The care placed in the development
                  of the main character is wonderful, but what makes this anime a standout to me is how much is put into the side characters as well. The writers created many, many characters you can genuinely feel for.  As someone who gets bored quickly with unnecessary side back stories and characters, I really appreciate this aspect of the story.",9
"
                Tokyo Ghoul was one of the anime I was admittedly on the fence about watching. However, I decided to give it a shot, and what I will say is that it was definitely worth my time, and just might be worth your time as well. To save everybody some reading, I’ll break it down as simply as I can. I’m sure other reviews can give a good enough basis of the plot so we’ll go ahead and skip that. 
Not many anime compel me to want to go back and read the manga, but Tokyo Ghoul did. Not only because I had heard the manga
                  was better from others, but because the story isn’t as fleshed out as I would have liked. Now I haven’t read any of it yet, so I can only give this review in terms of somebody who has only seen the anime.
I will say that I love the concept; it just lacked the proper amount of time to fit everything in nicely. The pacing feels incredibly rushed, and for the story that lies underneath it all, it definitely deserved more... a lot more. So while it’s an enjoyable experience, it feels like pieces are missing at times, character development falls a little flat, and that dampens the overall effectiveness of the presentation. Again, I still found it to be enjoyable, and not nearly as mediocre as many claimed, but I can understand why manga readers in particular may be upset. 
The art style is good, I love the designs and everything is pretty aesthetically pleasing even though I’d say the animation is just about average when compared to some other current anime. Oh, and yes of course it’s better uncensored. The censoring that this anime originally received is what put me off of it to begin with, but now it can be watched in all its original gory glory, the way it should be. 
The music is definitely fantastic. It’s probably my favorite aspect to the entire presentation of the show. The intro is absolutely beautiful, and as somebody who generally skips intros to save time I had to refrain from that for Tokyo Ghoul. I’ve found myself sitting through not only the intro but also the end credits of every episode. The voice acting is also great. All of the characters do a good job and at the end of the day that definitely helps keep the viewer engaged in what’s going on. So thumbs up on that!
Overall, will you like Tokyo Ghoul? Honestly I think it’s hit or miss, but it is definitely something you should at least watch a couple episodes of to see if you personally like what it has to offer. I had a hard time giving this a 6/10, it has so many things that are good about it, and yet so many glaring flaws. You may end up being pleasantly surprised like I was. It's a flawed yet worthy adventure. Just remember, if you want the *full* Tokyo Ghoul experience you will have to pick up the manga!",6
"
                This review contains SPOILERS so do not read this review if you have not watch Tokyo Ghoul.
Tokyo Ghoul is an action, bloodthirsty and supernatural anime that has lot of bloodshed and violence. If you want to watch an anime that has a lot of action, I recommend to watch this one. Tokyo Ghoul is like Deadman Wonderland and the video game Prototype. The anime has superpowers and a good story.
Story -7: The story is impressive, where ghouls who loves tasty meaty human flesh and if they eat anything else they will feel sick and vomit but it the story some missing elements. For example we
                  do not know much about the protagonist Kaneki and the anime does not tell us any information about him till the end of the anime. They need to give us more information on what the ghouls are. They need say why the ghouls cannot resist human flesh or why do the food taste awful to the ghouls or ancient history about them. Sometimes the story can be very confusing at times that you will keep saying ""I thought he.... When did he...."". Characters you cannot tell if they are dead or not, for example the one that Kaneki was dating she was been crushed by a building and I don't know if she was alive or dead. Sometimes I don't know what's is going, I keep saying ""Who died?, who is this or that?, why does everyone want to kill Kaneki!?."" 
Well the ending was too effortless for it not to have a season two. They must have a season two for it to end like that. The anime ended too quickly, they should have made 25 episode instead of 12.
Art/Sound - 7: I can't judge on the art because they are all good in almost every anime.
Character - 7: Our protagonist Kaneki is not that strong, I mean not his character but his strength. He keeps getting his ass kicked in every battle and somebody always has to help him. He has a lot to learn to control his power but then I think to myself, his half human, half ghoul so he would not  have the capable power of a full ghoul. And weirdest thing is that the food for example the hamburger, he tasted it and it was awful, that makes no sense. I mean his a ""half half"" right? can't the food be tasteless and he will not be starving. And he is a ""half half"" having human flesh should not be the only nutrients that he has can only have and he shouldn't be tempted of eat human flesh so bad, I mean he has half humanity left in him right? He seems like a ghoul instead of half half makes no sense. 
Enjoyment - 8: You will enjoy the action and bloodshed in this anime but I will say it again, it is like a Prototype where the blades come out of their hands and they can use powers, have different abilities.
Overall - 7: This anime is good don't listen to the haters and 10 year old. I think the story, the action and drama is very good but it lacks of explanation.",7
"
                I literally wanted to kill anyone who was about 100 cm in radius within me after i finished the last episode. 
Don't get me wrong, it was not because of the fact there were no episodes,NOT because there was a million dollar cliffhanger at the end but because of the emotional intensity of this anime.
Ah~ i remember Tokyo Ghoul manga- it was that one manga under the horror category which i didn't wanted to read- because i judged it's cover, but ultimately the manga rose to get a good rating and here we are the anime: the most wanted thing in the world for some
                  people. Read the synopsis first- it would give you some clueless story about Ghouls and stuff- but don't judge just watch and experience.
Story:I actually forgot the watch this story in the 3rd person view so i can criticize and judge it accurately- but that failed because the story was one of those which you get immersed from the start. This one i get is filed under the horror category, which i began to wonder which freaking part was horror. The battle scenes should have been thought out more- or they could have created an epic battle system. Character pasts of the story was emotional- it could make you cry whether you are a man/woman or a child. (yes so apparently 13 and 8 year olds watches this too) There were hints of ecchi- a little bit throughout the anime- the character development of the main lead was epic but alas it was given at the last moment. 
Art: Absolutely stunning, this anime has that vivid animating feature where you are in the middle of an epic battle or something important and something which is 100% reluctant to stay out of the safe zone comes inside and disturbs that epic scene causing it to be more intensifying for the audience. Kaneki's mask I'll wager is one of those popular Otaku iconic element in the 2014 for sure. 
The Scenic atmospheric elements have been reorganized to suit the emotions of the characters: for example, When the theme ""Hope"" is given- you can see the sun rising and bathing the current scenery with sunlight to suit the mood. I personally loved how the Intro totally matched the opening theme- extremely good. 
Sound:The opening theme was heaven to me. The ending was good. The lyrics of the opening matches Kaneki's situation so much that it seemed to me that it was made for this anime or something. There was good soundtracks but no signature ones i guess, all i know that it suited the mood perfectly. The Seiyus were superb. Also someone should stop giving Miyano-san which makes him look more like a sadistic bastard you know. *hehe*
Character: Kaneki is one of the iconic anime males in 2014, no doubt. You can see his image almost everywhere- his Ghoul mask illustrating most of his emotions. You get all sorts of interesting characters, their attitudes which justifies the situation- You get sadistic characters a lot in this one- all they think about is eating. We also see how people who get converted to be like animals- how they suffer in isolation and solitude. Their pasts dealing who they are mostly in every situation. The only personalties i took interest in was Hideyoshi/Uta/Kaneki and Suzuya. Take note of Hideyoshi that guy is very sharp, he is one of those memorable secondary best friend lead i've ever seen. and Suzuya's not what he is meant to be obviously. Mysterious symbolic elements are within this anime like a hidden object game which can tell it's own story to the audience if you can predict the future story by picking up the pace and the patterns.
Enjoyment: Before i started this anime- i knew it was epic to the core, everyone was talking about it, so many positive reviews. And yes i saved it for Halloween because i knew it was epic. I was literally crying at the middle of 11th and kicking the chair,shaking the PC with frustration during the 12 th episode along with my womanly tears for Kaneki- which i had no regret whatsoever for shedding them. There were some good humour in the anime- but would have liked more of it. 
Overall: It's definitely must-watch, this anime gives out very good morales. Apparently doing good to people does not always give you good- you gotta need some luck for it. Also there were many negative complaints about this being censored- i'm not going to voice my opinion on this but indirectly i would say- I watched horror all my life and the best horror stories/urban legends whatever does not need gore or jump scares to make it good. It all depends on the emotions which can give to the reader/audience and the story itself being unique and interesting. This anime very accurately gave out that disregarding utter gore but nevertheless did not completely fail to be a horror anime. Also keep in mind it's the world that's messed up not you- you voluntarily gets messed up because you can't handle it. Those who are the strongest are not the ones who have the best powers or physical strength, they are the ones who can keep their sanity and move through this hell like world. 
Happy Halloween 2014!
And a dedicated review to Kaneki Ken.",8

                [I HAVE NOT READ THE MANGA, SO THIS REVIEW IS FROM SOMEONE WITH NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IT]
My first impression of this anime was; ""Wow, this actually could be a decent one"". I was right, but I was also wrong at the same time.
I was surprised to see an anime with a dark theme which also was assiciated with the shounen genre, since of the year having lacked such deep, griddy and dark elements in an anime. So I was actually pleased to see something different. Now since it was a shounen, I was expecting no more than a mediocre anime that everyone will forget about
                  in a couple of months, though this anime seems to have left a mark in the community, even if the story progression was not all that great.
I have to say that the first half of Tokyo Ghoul was pleasing to watch, to a certain extent that is. This is because it had a nice progression and didn't rush anything to explain the situation that every character is in. After all the first impression is the most important one. Though I wish I could say the same thing about the second half. The second half seems rushed compared to the first, since it was not as slow paced and well organized as the other one. They introduced many characters that did not play much part in the anime for the rest of the series. This is also the point where I think that the story telling itself got sloppy. The main character, Kaneki Ken, lost almost all of the attention and the position for main character seemed to have switched off the the secondary characters. I have to say though that the last episode did make the first half justice.
The story is very tragic and the way the studio presented it with the art complimented the story accurately. It had a lot of shadows but not too many to keep one confused (this is, of course, if you ignore the constant censoring). The character designs, were pretty down to earth. No one had insanely unnatural aspects about them, ignoring the hair colors chosen. The way the characters are drawn were to be expected from a modern shounen.
They had different variants of characters, though they were mostly stereotypes or copy paste characters from different shows.
Since I have a kind of love/hate relationship with this anime I could not let it go even if my brain told me to. It was mediocre at best and will never rise above mediocrity. That is why I am rating this anime 5/10",5
"
                Tokyo Ghoul feels like a show that really wanted to be something dark and grown up, but had to be pulled back into it's shonen roots. I'm unfamiliar with it's origins, so I can't comment on that, but the show itself has a decent premise - the idea that there is another breed of humanity (?) called Ghouls. These ghouls have enhanced strength, speed, durability, an odd power-signature called a gleam, and an overpowering hunger for human flesh. They HAVE to eat it - and I like that the story has built in reasons as to why. At first, I thought this was just going
                  to be another take on the ""vampire who chooses not to drink blood"" trope, but no, a ghoul who starves themselves will inevitably go mad/rabid from hunger. Their tongues develop different taste buds, making natural foods taste rancid, and eating human food can even poison a ghoul. 
However, what, exactly, a ghoul is isn't explained very well. Are they like mutants, just an off-shoot branch of human evolution? I'd buy that, but then what is their gleam? The show has several gleams manifest throughout and they're all slightly different. They all originate from the back of the ghoul, and many appear to be tails of bright colors, but there are also wing-gleams or more blade-like gleams. Just what are these supposed to be? And there's the fact that they're apparently removable.
This hidden society is policed by the Doves - as they're nicknamed by the Ghouls - and the Doves use weapons called qinque. A qinque appears to be the gleam of a ghouls removed from their body. How this works without the body, I don't know. How the qinque, which often change shape or move according to natural instructions, function without their natural form, I don't know. It's never addressed in the body of the show.
The series itself features a number of ghouls and (largely) two Doves, but our star is a Normal, Quiet, Average Young Man named Kaneki. He's pretty boring and largely uninteresting until he has ghoul parts put into his body and thus, he becomes half-ghoul, and we follow him into this world. 
I have to say, I didn't like Kaneki all the way through the show. He's too quiet and too withdrawn for a lead character. He falls into each situation, barely manages to make it out alive, and makes no decisions. Everything he has in the show is handed to him and that REALLY bothered me - until episode 12. I won't go into details, as the Guidelines say to avoid spoilers, but episode 12 explains Kaneki's motivations from the beginning. It also breaks those motivations and suddenly I'm much more interested in where he's going. It's actually a shame that the change in character happens only at the end because New Kaneki suddenly has a bite to him.
The show also throws in the ""he's a half-breed, so he's more powerful!"" trope, which only bothers me because the nature of what creates a ghoul is never explored in this. Given that Kaneki is the first human turned into a ghoul by science (it appears), that would make me think that he should be critical to the ghoul/human situation. Isn't there some kind of gene test to see if someone is a ghoul? I would think that if a body can only process human flesh, there HAS to be something going on with that. But again, we get no explanation, just that Kaneki tastes better than any other human and when another ghoul eats some of him they get super-charged and on and on. 
There are a smattering of side-characters that are vaguely interesting. For me, Amon - who is one of the Doves - is the most interesting character in the show. He's a lawman, looking to bring the ghouls to heel, but the loss of someone close to him pushes him further. I don't quite buy the logic of this drive, as the character who dies is kind of insane and really unrelatable, but at least Amon makes decisions and CHOOSES to do something about it.  
As I said at the start, the show really starts to push itself into darker themes - ghouls predation on humanity, how hunting ghouls affects the Doves, how ghouls interact with each other, and how both sides tend to view the other as something less than human. But then it also pulls back at nearly all of these story points. Amon's partner, Mado, comes off as a ghoul-hunting-psychotic, but we're never shown why, and it's hard to care for him when he laughs as he kills people that the show goes out of it's way to make you care for. The show seems to be presenting neither side as right, and positions Kaneki to be the bridge between the two, but he's so busy getting the crap beaten out of him and being indecisive that nothing ever comes from this.
The show LOOKS good for the most part. Character designs are clean and effective, no two characters look alike, and the fighting animation looks good. The visual effects for the gleams were really well done and often pretty neat looking.
Despite my overall complaints about the show, it's watchable, although I did have to kind of drag myself to the finish line once I got to the last three episodes. There are a lot of interesting concepts brought up in the show, but it fails to explore those satisfactorily. I'm hesitant to say that maybe if it ran for longer, it would have, but I kind of get the feeling that it wouldn't have. Thankfully for it's narrative, an interesting world and interesting side characters make the show entertaining enough to string the watcher along. I wouldn't ever put this on my Top Ten list, but it isn't horrible either.",7
"
                Characters: Meh. Only ones that matter are the MC, Rize, and Jason. The rest are insignificant to the plot and its development.
Animation: Good. Fighting is odd and I felt like there wasn't any flow to it causing my eyes to try and find a focal point in the midst of it all. Also, CENSORS THAT BLOCK THE ENTIRE SCREEN 
Soundtrack: Meh.
Story: Meh.
Overall: Good watch, doesn't live up to hype though. Go watch Zankyou no Terror instead for this season.

                Shock censored anime
MC is a crybaby (Shinji Ikari tier).
One of those cliche white knight characters that wanna make a difference between 2 opposing entities. 
8.0+ rating I dont get it
This anime is as cliche as you can get, he gets some sort of power that makes him different and unique, but hes still a bitch. He proceeds to get himself rekt by bad guys and good guys who try to bring him to reality and ofcourse its super cliche so someone innocent has to die for him to figure shit out. 
The ""bad"" guy comes and he starts talking white knight bullshit to him. 
 ""ghoul lives matter"" even though the majority of them see no reason to not kill and eat humans. This is the type of anime where the bad guys are the main characters, and the ""doves""(police) are the bad guys. 
Who is the bad guy?, kinda hard to tell. Well just assume everyone is the bad guy. 
IMO dubstep makes a crap soundtrack lol but this is just my opinion of course. 
PS: Something very weird is going on, the first review I wrote for some reason got changed from a review for Tokyo Ghoul to parasyte(got me a alot of deserved hate)...The second review my overall score from 3 got changed to a 9.....sketchy.",3
"
                Ever had that moment where someone told you, ""hey wanna hear something?"" and they end up saying never mind? Any normal human being would feel like they've been left hanging and leaves one thinking ""what was he/she going to tell me? is it bad? good?"" This is the experience you will get with this particular season of Tokyo Ghoul. After watching it, you will be left with a void; and not the kind of void where you hunger for more, rather one of those ""read the manga"" kinda trolled feeling. As of writing the review, there is a second season but I will be focusing
                  on this first season.
The story/plot is nothing to write home about, however, it isn't something to completely brush off as a generic plotline that is highly predictable either. There are 2 beings, Ghouls and Humans. Ghouls eat humans because their the only ones that are considered nutritious to the body of a ghoul and humans are pretty much defenseless outside of the CCG (anti-ghoul operators). Then comes in our MC Kaneki Ken who somehow becomes an oddball to society after an encounter and it makes him half human, half ghoul. 
The problem with the whole story line is if you're interested in backstories of how things come to be, then this show does nothing to fill that hole. There is no explanation of how ghouls came to exist, how humans have dealt with ghouls and why is society the way it is even though they have been together for 70+ years (going off one of the ghoul characters in the show). These are things that if left unanswered, makes some viewers think where the show is headed towards. For this kind of show, just turn your brain off and enjoy the censored violence/action scenes. Don't try to delve into a deeper concept of the show or you'll turn up empty.
Characters are fairly standard. They introduce a boatload of characters, but in 12 episodes, there really is no room to bring out any character traits for any of them. What you see is what you get. I felt Ken was the only character in the show to have some kind of motivation to answer one a question of the show's plot being if humans can coexist with ghouls. Every episode kept bringing forth new characters and it became more of a violent, fighting show more so than for other aspects that people may enjoy such as character development/story development. 
Sound is pretty good, its hype when it needs to be and music fits the mood of certain scenes in the show. If whoever is reading this hasn't watched the show, you can watch the opening and call it a wrap because its probably the only thing i enjoyed in the series besides the last episode. 
Tokyo ghoul definitely had the pieces it needed to be a more thought provoking and conceptual show, but it falls flat probably to please a certain audience that I'm unaware of. I've not read the manga for this, but if it disproves my thoughts on the show then so be it. This is strictly a review for the first season. 
Final thoughts- watched too many great shows and need something to ease up with? Grab some popcorn and enjoy the blood/violence. Make sure to turn your brain off because deeper and more meaningful themes are not present in this first season.",4
"
                ""To be, or not to be"" says William Shakespeare in Hamlet. If Sui Ishida was a poet, he would maybe have written something similar to this, ""To be, or not to be a ghoul"". But Mr.Ishida is Japanese, not English and that's why he wrote a manga and made a lot of Otakus very happy. In 2014 an, on this manga based, anime came out, with the same name. May I present...TOKYO GHOUL!
Plot and Story Line
Okay, before I start with the plot and story I have to make one thing clear. Although the manga and the anime are similar, they are not the same. Funimation
                  changed the chronology  and a trifle of the main plot  and added some annoying censorship (more about it in animation section).The main story line however, remains the same, and let's review this thing already. 
We firstly need a setting for this story. Tokyo, Japan. In recent time the city is being haunted by half-human half-monster creatures called Ghouls. The ghouls have special abilities and enormous strenght, but have to carry the ""curse"" of not being able to eat human food. They have to eat human flash in order to survive. But eventough it's hard for them to survive without it, some ghouls try not to eat humans. At least not the living ones.
 In such a crazy world lives Ken Kaneki, a rather ordinary 18-year-old university student. One day, Kaneki decides to go out on a date with a very intelligent, as he thought, girl called Rize. Poor Kankei, he didn't know what was waiting for him. While walking Rize home, she suddenly attacs him and reveals her true self. Yes Kaneki, Rize is a ghoul. I am sorry. Luckily, an accident on the construction side, stopped Rize from eating Kaneki, yet he had to be hospitalized. In order to save his life the doctor Kanou transplanted some of Rize's organs into Kaneki. But what Kaneki thought was a kidney was actually Rize's kagune (a ghoul's predatory organ used as their weapon). Dear dr.Kanou, that usually  makes experiments with ghouls, turned our cute, innocent Kaneki into a half-ghoul. And that's my dear readers when everythings starts. 
I mentioned the Hamlet quote for a good reason, because most of the anime turns into a fight of human-Kaneki and ghoul-Kaneki. The steady struggle inside kills him (not literary). Just imagine the pain he had trying not to eat human beings, being one too just a day ago.
 His moral and attachment to humanity kept him up all this time. And as such, he also tryed to make the humans and ghouls understand each other. In a couple of moments he spares the life of ghoul investigators trying to explain that ghouls also have a human side, like him and the other non-human-eating-ghouls at Ainteku. Unfortunately, that didn't work. His dream as a half-ghoul to be the linking bound between those two worlds turned into a nighmare and made him realize on thing: ""This world is wrong"". 
If you decide to watch or read Tokyo Ghoul, be prepared. There is so much action, so many fights and so many bloodshead. It is just amazing. I really love action and there were some action scenes I watched twice. I just had to, because they were so epic. If you are a action-adict as me, I am sure that you will love Tokyo Ghoul. I garantee you an intersting story from the very beginning making you imaptient for the third season to air. 
The only little disadvantage of this anime are some plot holes in the background stories but they are negligible. 
I became a huge fan of Tokyo Ghoul after watching it. You should see my school notebooks. Full of drawings of Suzuya, Touka and my own Tokyo Ghoul O.C.s. Now let's see the characters.
Characters
Hmm...Wahat to say about the characters. Just great. There are so many different charactes, unique personalities and awesome character developments regarding their background stories. I loved almost every character in this anime, whether he was a villian or a hero. The ""almost every"" is beacuse of the one and only guy I hated in this anime. Ayato Kirishima, the younger brother of Touka. I just didn't like his attitude and the way he thought about the world. Nevermind, let's move on to the three I want to talk about.
KEN KANEKI as said in the beginning, an ordianry 18-year-old student that loves to read in his free time. Although most people would call him weak and a cry-baby, I wouldn't. His pain is so damn hard to bear because he was made as a ghoul, he wasn't born as one. You have to look at it from his point of view. I envied him on his humanity and attitude, I really did.
There she is. TOUKA KIRISHIMA is such a badass of a woman. She is so strong and independent, and although she looks cold-hearted, deep inside she is a very caring and nice person always ready to save the ones that are close to her. I also have to mention the way she manages to have a normal human life despite being a ghoul. I am actually a bit sad about her loosing her tuff and badass personality in the end, not fair Mr.Ishida and Funimation.
This is my favorite character of all. JUUZOU SUZUYA is a childish, optimistic and crazy person that went trough a lot of pain in his childhood. He is so funny but detremine and careless that makes him the most unigue character I've ever seen. His personality developes to a more responsible ghoul investigator in the Tokyo Ghoul: Re manga series. It's still airing...
Animation and Style
As said in the previous review I decided to add ""Style"" to this review section, so let's see. Firstly the animation. As expected from a 2014 anime, the animation is awesome. Bright and dark colors when needed, awesome backrounds and what's most to pride is the caharacter design. The style of this anime is also outstanding. One of the best I've ever seen. It's unique and special, just beautiful.I have to mention the fact that that's the reason that made me watch this anime. A good friend of mine told me about the epic animation of Tokyo Ghoul and I thought :""I have to see that one"". I wasn't disappointed and became a great fan in an instant.
Conclusion:
Watch Tokyo Ghoul folks! It is amazing and has already become a cliche anime in the world. You have an interesting story a smooth plot, some awesome characters and unfrgetable fights. I truly recommend you to watch it and please don't judge it on the first glance, there is a lot of deep stuff in this show. My dear readers, Tokyo Ghoul!

                OK so i'm gonna start this review by saying that this may contain spoilers so if you don't want that then move on to the rating sections.
OK so this show had a lot of hype before it started and with one of the most popular manga I can see why.
it really had a lot of potential and i'm sad to say that was wasted and I mean big time like the censoring this show had was horrendous censoring and almost made me drop the show.
Like at that part where that one women I forgot her name she was killed by mado
and as soon as it
                  happend guess what? it completely went off screen and at this point I was pissed off because there i'm left wondering if she was alive or not there was so much more then this that was completely left out of the show from the manga and adding top that kaneki's annoying ass whining throughout the show damn.
Story (4)
the story was more less rushed to death with plot holes and censoring that almost killed it for me a lot of scenes from the manga were not even in the anime so a lot went unexplained.
Art (8) 
one of this shows saving graces and I mean i love the art and animation in this show now it's not like it is anything special but from I what seen it was great but there was to much censoring for me to enjoy it fully.
Sound (10) 
the best part of the show was the music damn the OP is one of my all time favorites now and top that with amazing sound during fight scenes and a good ed adds up to amazing music.
characters  (7)
and finally the part I wanted to talk about most of all the characters there's the over dramatic annoying Kaneki  there's Tohka the best character in the show IMO she kicks ass and babysits kaneki to because well he's to much of a whining ass to do anything until the end that is but you would have to watch it to see what i'm talking about then there's the crazy villan mado Kaneki's best friend and so on.
kaneki is more or less your typical do gooder who wants to help everyone in danger and become stronger to protect them but he can be annoying like hell at times because of his whining but other than that he's OK and then tohka man I love her she's my favorite character in the show badass is all iv'e got to say about her.
supporting characters are nice to there's Uto who is not in the show as much as I would have wanted him to be but he's ok while he's in it then there's   mado the villan idiotic but nice and then that detective dude who is more like mado's partner I guess but he's okay to.
Overall (6) this has got to be the biggest disappointment of the entire summer damn the censoring the annoying ass main character damn just about everything went wrong I hope a season 2 is made or something because this was bad compared to the manga
Enjoyment (8)
this show was disappointing yes compared to the manga but as a standalone anime show I can say that i enjoyed it quiet a lot just hope there's a season 2 to redeem itself.
It's okay for just an anime watcher but if your a manga reader and hoped that it would be as good as the manga then boy are you
 gonna be disappoited unless you take some pain killers to stop the pain from  coming every time they skip huge parts of the manga but other than that avoid this like the plague manga readers anime only watchers try it out.",6
"
                Lately i have found much enjoyment in Dark animes, Tokyo Ghoul was to much satisfaction giving me all the Dark Fantasy anime i needed. This show really gets going quite early and with only 12 episodes in the first season, that is expected. Regardless there is enough material in those 12 episodes to leave me wanting more. 
First off the story of Tokyo ghoul is a frightening dark one, more so then what i was expecting. Our main character Ken Kaneki is faced with the burden of becoming a ghoul (Not by choice, watch and find out why.) he must find ways to deal with
                  the many problems a ghoul faces, for example being hunt down by Anti-Ghoul investigators or learning how to accept eating humans. On the way he meets other Ghouls who become his friends and help guide him through these hard trials. It is your typical Dark Anime story: A character accepting his new way of life. Eventually we learn there are good ghouls who try and co-exist with humans and bad ghouls who want to rid of the humans. The story leads to a 3 way battle between the ""good ghouls"" (Anteiku), the ""bad ghouls"" (Aogiri Tree) and  the Commission of Counter Ghouls.
I have not much to say about Art and Sound as I do not watch anime for those reasons, But i will say i had no problem with anything of the sort in Tokyo Ghoul.
Back to our main Character Ken Kaneki, a human who becomes a ghoul. His character does not take well to the transition of becoming a human eating ghoul (who would) alot of crying and weeping occurs for Ken Kaneki, sadly enough it takes along time for it to end. I was hoping the transition to him accepting his new life and becoming the hero of the story would happen sooner. There are a few moments were we see the potential he holds but it doesn't come to full capacity until we near the end. Outside of Ken Kaneki we dont get a view into any of the characters other lifes, and once again with only 12 episodes it is quite hard to. Toka's life (One of the first ""good ghouls"" ken encounters) is still much of a mystery come the end of season. As well as Hide, kens bestfriend who is a human. On a side note i did enjoy the character Shū Tsukiyama who really embraces the Dark side of this anime with his fond appetite and sadistic ways.
Overall Tokyo Ghoul was quite dark and a few times made me cringe, and in a way thats what makes me like it. Backed up by an interesting story of the life of a Ghoul and i find myself pretty satisfied.Still, 12 episodes was not enough and i hope the 2nd season explains alot more about the background story of some of the characters. Also quite excited to see the new Ken Kaneki. Tokyo Ghoul season 1 receives a solid 8.2 thriving off the interesting life of a Ghoul!",8

                When I watched Tokyo Ghoul I felt mixed emotions. Although the great ambiance  and what in the first look seems like well developed characters, the history is not well developed, and some characters simple became two-dimensional. Especially in the final half, the choices and the focus seems to be in the wrong scenes and characters, and it is made poorly.
I will try to judge it based  in the anime only, since I didn't had read the manga yet when I watched it. But I still have to do some reservations specially regarding the character development and changes in history.
The first half episodes are
                  quite enjoyable, I would even said that it is better than the manga begging. The rivalry between Rise and Jason, that help to the creation of the final climax, and the much darker and dreadful ambiance than what manga presents. I got truly worried about Kaneki issues.
The second half is where everything goes downhill. A lot of information bad presented or not presented at all, that always keep you in the dark. Scenes with no context, crucial scenes to the character's development excluded. The changes in the order of events don't help either, they instead made appear that Kaneki strength development is equal to none.
I think my biggest issue is how some characters and parts of the history are so radically different from manga. There is no ""Yamoru"" in the anime only a psycho Jason 24/7. Aogiri? These guys are to cool to you to know anything about them, instead we will just show these dialogues that don't offer no context at all. Good fights? Sorry we only have 12 episodes and we need the extra time to the no-context scenes.
Although the flaws, especially in the second half, I think that Tokyo Ghoul is quite enjoyable. The manga is far superior, but if you don't wanna read it you will be fine with the anime (as long as as you don't watch season 2).",8

                Most peple on the internet declared it to be the greatest anime of 2014. Beautiful fan art of it filled my feed. My friend literally begged me to watch it. And so, I watched the all twelve episodes of Tokyo Ghoul. 
Story
Yeah, well, you probably know the story by now.
Characters
The characters are pretty much standard fare anime characters. We have the whiny, powerful main character who does almost absolutely nothing during the entire show except for cry and wonder why he is so weak without bothering to try to make himself stronger. The only hero who bugged me even more than the brilliantly named 'Kaneki
                  Ken-kun' was Yuuki from Mirai Nikki. If you can even call that guy a hero. But it hurts more in Tokyo Ghoul because Kaneki has so much potential, and can easily be one of the strongest Ghouls around, but decides to spend 95% of the anime wailing. The last ten minutes give him credit though. And he looks freaking awesome with that mask.
Rize has far less screen time than most other characters, but is more important than most of them. It is because her organs are transplanted into Kaneki that he develops his ghoul powers, his kagemune, and becomes a one eyed ghoul. She appears time to time, usually seducing our main hero while trying to convince him to accept his ghoul powers and use them.
Touka is kind of a mix of two characters. On one count, she reminds me of Mikasa Ackerman of SHingeki no Kyojin because of her attitude and her raw power, besides her latent arrogance. I mean, the moment I saw her, I thought 'Mikasa'. There's one huge difference though. Touka is a tsundere, while Mikasa is a partial yandere. Not Yuno level, but she is obsessed with Eren.
The second one, and I realized this immediately too, is her appearence resembles Mei Misaki from Another. They both have navy-blue hair that covers one of their eyes. I don't know, it just popped into my mind.
She's probably the most interesting of all the characters anyhow.
We then have a bunch of characters who, as usual, I didn't really care much for. There's the painfully and blatantly evil Mado (I think that's his name), the heroic Amos who has a couple of minutes wondering about the morality of what he's doing, the cooking guy who is basically the Orochimaru of this anime (pedophilic, continuously licking his lips). Not to mention that white haired kid who looks kinda like a girl, and a bunch of police guys. I mean, I don't even remember hearing their names. And there's Jason, a sadistic and overly-violent ghoul.
Another character is Hide, who is basically Kaneki's best friend, but his importance basically diminished as the show went on.
Unfortunately, I didn't really like many of the characters of the show, and I kept feeling like I saw all of them somewhere else.
Presentation
On the animation front, I have absolutely no problems. I don't think I've paused the video in order to absorb in the beauty of the animation this much for any other show. And this is remarkable, because Tokyo Ghoul entirely takes place in a mundane metropolitan background. They don't even get chances to render stunning vistas like Sword Art Online did, but it impressed me all the same. The sound didn't really stick out much, but the voice actors play their parts well and match the characters. The opening is something to be admired and matches ethereal vocals with beautiful imagery. The animation studio is the same one that took care of Bleach, so they're pretty experienced.
Something I should mention about this show: it's very gory. I mean, not like Corpse Party gore. Or maybe it is. Unfortunately, the anime right now is only available in the censored version, which means your experience will freqeuntly be marred by unnatural black shadows running acorss someone's stomach. But when the uncensored version does come out, you're gonna see lots of graphic imagery. Ghouls eat humans after all, so don't be surprised if you see one bite off a chunk of meat.
As for how the idea is presented...that's what I really wanted to talk about. Once again, Tokyo Ghoul feels like a collection of various ideas that I've seen in various other shows. For example, its moral ambiguity. Throughout the entire show, Tokyo Ghoul wants to make you wonder whether humans are right to kill ghouls as monsters or not. Many anime before this one have tried this idea, but the only other show that has it this fleshed out is Shiki, and I know most people won't agree with me, but I think Shiki did it better. Shiki was more of a mystery, and less intermittently splattered with blood. Because of this, it humanizes (is that the right word here, considering what I'm talking about?) both sides until you actually care for both races. On the other hand, Tokyo Ghoul's viewpoint is primarily from the Ghouls, with humans mostly being depicted as arrogant people who kill ghouls and look down upon them. Throughout the series, you'll be supporting the ghouls without a second thought for mankind. In fact, humans are made so easily hateable that you'll wish all of them were dismembered without a second thought. The only morally grey character is Amos, and he felt to perfect and heroic, and loaded with judgemental ideas to be likeable, so I wanted him to die too.
Another thing is those eyes. Those eyes. Seen them somewhere? Maybe, maybe not. If you have, it just might be Shiki, where black eyes with red irises are used to distinguish the Shiki from humans. Sound familiar? In this anime, it's what is used to differentiate between ghouls and humans.
I can make a vague reference to Lucy's hands in Elfen Lied about Kaneki's kagemune, but that isn't really valid because Kaneki's power looks more like tentacles. Let's hope that doesn't go down the wrong road one day. Just kidding, Tokyo Ghoul is too good to go down the same road that Sword Art Onine went on.
Then, as you approach the final episodes of the show, we get an extended and mostly unnecessary torture scene that brought up memories of RIN: Daughters of Mnemosyne, whose first or second episode features a similarly sadistic antagonist and a similarly fast-regenerating protagonist. Of course, RIN was far more explicit and would probably have to be completely censored (for a good reason this time) but you know what I'm talking about.
The show contains some shounen elements like Kaneki not wanting to hurt anyone, but that gets rectified by the end of the series.
Overall
Tokyo Ghoul feels more like a prologue to something else far more interesting. While the animation was well taken care of, the idea of thrusting 60 chapters into 12 episode is not logically sound, and led to us losing most of the interesting details in the process. It also feels like there were too many arcs in such a short span, and seeing someone who was absolutely hated three episodes earlier helping our heroes is kind of jarring. Besides that, it also feels like an amalgamation of ideas from other anime piled into one. While most others may like the idea, I sat there and throughout the show  I thought 'Hey, nice idea. But it was better done in (insert anime name here)'. 
Overall, watch it, because it's still pretty good despite its faults. Be prepared for a blood-fest, though. With a lot of black lines.

                Tolyo Ghoul was recommended to me by a friend. He said this anime had blood, battles and an awesome main character. So after giving it a watch I can call it only one thing: Disappointing (I haven't read the  manga btw). 
Tokyo Ghoul centres around a boy named Kaneki. Ghouls are monsters who look like humans and eat human flesh to survive. After an incident with a ghoul Kaneki undergoes an operation where his organs are replaced by ghoul organs. Now he is a half-ghoul and must eat human flesh in order to survive. He also meets ghouls who are living in secret and
                  makes some of them his friends.
The first two episodes and the opening sequence were awesome. They perfectly showed Kaneki's hunger and how he struggles with it. We see Kaneki trying to keep his humanity as his ghoul hunger seems to take over his mind. It also promises to delve into the subject of insanity and show us a psychological warfare between Kaneki's human and ghoul personalities. 
Sadly, what follows are nothing that even come close to these topics. Instead, what we are given are filler episodes that mostly consists of Kaneki whining about himself. Kaneki's mental war between his two personalities are completely forgotten until the very last episode. And whatever happens in all the other episodes contribute almost nothing to the plot or Kaneki's development as a character. 
This anime has a very large cast of characters. But each of them get very little screentime to make any kind of impact. On the ghoul side we have the Manager, Touka, Jason and some other characters I won't bother to mention. On the human side we have the ghoul investigators Mado and Amon, and some others who appear later in the series.
Mado was actually my favourite of the bunch. Maybe because he was just plain evil and badass, but also because he is a nice guy when it comes to work. All the other characters ( with the exception of Jason) can be summed up in one word: Hypocrites. Especially Amon, whose hypocrisy knows no bounds. Their actions made me want to scream at the screen because of how self-contradictory they were.
The animations and sounds were good, nothing too special. However, the opening and ending songs were some of the best I have seen in anime. The fights, especially the ones in the last episode were very good. It's a shame, because the censoring blacked out half the screen during the bloody parts. 
Overall, this could have been an excellent anime if it focused more on Kaneki's development in the middle episodes. I can only recommend watching the first and last two episodes since only these are the ones that are not fillers.
Note: This anime ends with a cliffhanger good enough to make you want to watch the second season. But don't get your hopes high.",5
"
                Average anime to be honest, it starts off quite well with an interesting story but then suddenly a lot seems to be forced into a small number of episodes. The story became a bit less interesting and characters didn't really seem very like-able. Might be nice for someone looking for some blood & action but personally i thought the story wasn't too great, especially the last episode which didn't feel at all like an ending and was actually the most boring of all 12 episodes.. That's my opinion anyway..
              ",7

                This is an anime that you think is the best anime in the world, then two hours later it's the worst thing you've ever seen.  Or it was for me.
Story: 5/10
I never fully understood the story of Tokyo Ghoul.  The idea of ghouls 'suddenly' taking over is very complex.  I must admit this has pretty good execution, but never really liked it.  But everybody wants to be a ghoul just to have a kick ass kagune, right?
Art: 6/10
The art was pretty average for an anime, in my opinion.  My favorite thing was how all the characters had their own unique
                  thing, like Kaneki's one eye, Juuzou's weird personality, Touka's confusing human life, etc.  But overall, I mainly enjoyed everybody's kagune.
Sound: 4/10
Pretty self explanatory, the only good 'sound' in the anime is the OP and the ending.
Character: 4/10
As explained while while I was talking about art, the best part is everybody's personality and uniqueness.  But honestly, every character in anime with white hair is usually crazy as shit. :/
Enjoyment: 5/10
I binge watched this anime, and of course it's a lot different than waiting for the next episode to come out.  The ending of the first season was not as epic to me as it was to most people.
Overall: 4/10
Wouldn't watch again.",4

                Please note that this is a review for two seasons that are released at the time of writing this review, not just the first season.
You might like this anime if:
- You are new to anime
- You enjoy dark anime
- You don't care about the bad things, and instead, focus on the good ones
- You are looking for some decent fighting scenes
You might dislike this anime if:
- You watched a decent amount of anime, especially the top ones- You dislike edgy shows
- You hate weak  main characters
- You are looking for well-developed characters
- You hate shows with weird pacing
- You hate forced romance
- You are looking for an anime with a good, consistent plot
Story: 6
The biggest problem with the story of Tokyo Ghoul is that it's all over the place. It may be caused by the length of the series, but I honestly cannot tell. The story also tries to make you feel bad for a couple of good ghouls, and portray humanity as stupid, cruel bastards, who can't understand that 5% of ghouls (who EAT ONLY HUMAN FLESH) are not evil, and instead they just eat already dead bodies, as if that's okay or something. Also, the romance feels inappropriate and forced in for the sake of appealing to the younger audience.  There are redeeming qualities, as the ghoul ""culture"" is actually quite interesting. Their behavior and backstory, as well as their attempts at blending into society,  proved to be something that grabbed my attention more than what was actually supposed to do it. Some scenes were also okay, but the longer I watched, the worse it got. At some points, I felt genuinely insulted by the stupidity of the plot. In the end, it made too many stupid decisions with the direction it was taking, trying to take itself way too seriously, while some aspects of it were really dumb.
Art and Animation: 7
Both are for the most part decent, with a few drops here and there and a few really pretty scenes. The main problem I have with the art style, however, is its darkness. I understand that it's a dark show, and the art style should complement it, but at some point, I got bored of seeing blue, dark blue, black and gray. It jumps from those colors from time to time, but while watching, you will mostly see these ones. The character designs, for the most part, are fine, but a few are just plain stupid. Not going to say which ones though, because of spoilers. Overall the art style is okay, but nothing too memorable, maybe except for a few scenes scattered around.
Sound: 9
The best part of the anime in my book. I can hear the care, that has been put into the soundtrack and overall its really enjoyable. It fits the scenes well. Extra points for the first opening, and the endings. I would consider that opening to be one of the best ones ever. Ironic how I have the least to say about my favorite part of the show.
Characters: 4
Sadly, the characters, that at the beginning seemed interesting, were turned into stereotypes one after another. I don't want to write an essay on every single one so I'll try to sum it up in two sentences. There are about two moments where the characters develop at all. There should be more care put into them, as the show tries hard to be heavily focused on the characters. That should be enough. This is not the biggest problem though. The biggest problem is the side characters. Basically there are too many of them, they are introduced way too fast, and you never get a chance to care about 90% of them. There are one or two exceptions, but that doesn't change the fact, that they are also massively underdeveloped. So was there anything that I liked about the characters? Well, while their motives were mostly trash, in some scenes they seemed believable. Not often, but sometimes. Overall I felt disappointed by the lackluster characters, as some of them had some serious potential.
Enjoyment: 5
I didn't care for most of the characters, so I had to push forward without anything good to cling to. I had hopes for this, I really did, and even while the quality gradually dropped, I hoped that it would become something more. It never did. There were a few scenes that grabbed my attention, but between them, I had to watch something, that I wasn't really interested in. Disappointment is a word that describes my experience with this anime the best. 
Overall: 6
It had potential, it had good core material, it had a good idea of where it wanted to go, it had an interesting setting, but it lacked way too much to deviate from the pile of mediocre anime. While it's not the worst thing that happened to humanity, as some people may lead you to believe, it's not worth a watch unless you just don't have anything better to watch. But hey, if you do decide to watch it, try not to think too much, as this anime is clearly not made for that. And you should watch it, in order to witness how can something with high potential be easily ruined. Also, read the manga, it's actually really good, which surprised me drastically. But hey, in the end, everything is just my opinion. Just try no to call it the best thing in the world, and I won't mind.",6

                Tokyo Ghoul is a supernatural- horror(questionable) anime summer release, or simply put propably the most anticipated aka hyped anime of the year.
The fact that they released only 12 episodes it was definitely a deteriorating factor, thats why i will judge the anime by its 12 episodes and not ''how could it turned to be if it were more' afterall thats a producing studio decision and it would have been UNFAIR for the anime itself to be judged like that.
Specifically:
Story 7: Inevitably it was rushed, but it had a steady flow and some very interesting twists. Its crucial to mention that it succeeds where many other
                  animes have failed..and thats to create a very dark enviroment even though i wouldnt label it as a pure horror anime.
1 Ghouls that apart from flesh and blood are keen on cofee? Hell yeah!
Different kind of masks to personalize the ghouls a little bit more? Hell yeah
These were some interesting little things that definitely enhanced the anime and improved the immersion
Art 8 : Art is of top notch..lively colorfoul and very realistic. The battle are definitely above average, and of course cagounes steal the show.You wonna see some epic battles full of blood and some gore characteristics?...well u have them
Sound 9 : Easily its strong aspect, the intro and ending songs are both great the sound effects are amazing.Moreover Kaneki's character Hanae Natsuki sure made one of the best voice acting i have experienced definitely in my top 5. Kaneki's reaction's add a lot of drama that help the dark side of the anime
Characters 5 :Its not something new...yeah Tokyo Ghoul really struggled in terms of character development, even Touka who is MC we dont get to know much about her during the 12 episodes.So beyond Touka and Kaneki the other support characters, even though they got their respective time we hardly thought we know anything about them after the 12th episode, there were just ''filling'' the spots and that was bad
Enjoyemnt 7: Adjectively i think people will enjoy this anime, it dielevers a dark enviroment with some flashy and bloody fights between ghouls and ghouls with humans, the story its not rocket science thats for sure, but ic ant be helped ..there are only 12 episodes,
Overall 7: I Would like to pinpoint 2 things
First Tokyo Ghoul dielevers exactly what it created for, a dark bloody enviroment , and it does it well, it is almost certain that anime that get hyped so much are doomed to fail most of the times*Aka dramatical murder'' but i think tokyo ghoul w as pretty solid, with its glitches of course
Secondly with all the respect i see a very small number of reviewrs who vote music/art 9 and then they give it a 3 overall because it dissapointed them its not like the manga they dont even bother making an average rating, taking into account that people read us in order to start an anime, i beileve we ought to try and be as much adjective as we can
Thank you in Advance

                No, I haven't read the manga. As the other reviewers noted, Tokyo Ghoul is a dark fantasy set in Tokyo. Our hero, Kaneki Ken is an average, bookish fellow whose life takes a drastic turn after his first date with an attractive girl. Turns out the girl has an uncontrollable case of munchies. No, this is not a love story. Spoilers ahead. 
For 11 episodes, Tokyo Ghoul is an anime that deserves praise. An anime that isn't afraid to delve into philosophy: What does it mean to be human? Should you be considered human if your biological default is to eat another human? Does denial
                  of the self serve friendship? What does it mean to be selfish? When is it time to be selfish? Good stuff. One of the things that made this series so enjoyable for me is that it asked questions. 
Animation 9/10, Sound 10/10
The visuals are well-done, even though certain scenes bordered on the meme territory (e.g. copious amounts of tears, extreme close ups of characters shouting and roaring in their emotional moments). The artsy and obviously half-hearted blood censorship (color inverts) made it more stimulating. The music and the sounds were decent.  
Story 8/10, Character 7/10
The pacing is all right, striking a balance between moving the overall plot and providing the necessary back story. Granted, not all important characters were given the back story treatment. I don’t get the complaints that the pacing sucked because it didn’t match the manga.
The world building is decent. The series refrained from explaining everything, possibly because the manga has not provided the materials. That works for the story because it’s unlikely to have Kaneki undergo a massive information dump on ghoul living. As far as the story is concerned, Kaneki is an average citizen, trying to live the life of a murder-free ghoul. He's not being schooled as a secret agent, so giving the audience a major intel on Tokyo ghouls and a rigorous course on ghoul mythology is a fat the series does not need.   
For the 12th episode, Tokyo Ghoul deserves to be panned. I'm aware that the manga is ongoing, that's why I can forgive some missteps, like the certain fight subplots in episode 12. On second thought, those missteps are rather unforgivable. I guess they didn’t decide to wait for the manga for this cash grab. Instead of making a semi-satisfying conclusion to these encounters, the studio decided to leave it hanging.
The character development is superb... for 11 episodes anyway. The biggest disappointment is that Kaneki went through the personality vortex and came back another person... almost like another character! I'm certain the manga has  a good excuse as to why the introspective Kaneki, who constantly negotiates with his inner psycho and determines that empathy should win every time, suddenly turned into a cold ""bad ass"" that served the revenge fulfillment of some audiences. Trauma, perhaps. This ""bad ass"" engaged in casual cruelty: torturing an already subjugated villain, oh just because hmm plot device. We’re supposed to derive some emotional closure to this? Problem is, the audience is well-aware the character has been traumatized and is engaging in acts he would not normally do... and yet the studio decided to package this as some sort of triumphant ending.  
*sigh* 
Eleven out of 12 episodes are well done, so the series is worth a chance, even with the last episode taking a bit of dive.",8
"
                I don't think it would be an exaggeration when I say Tokyo Ghoul is one of the more recently hyped anime series but I did not go in with any expectations, rather I went in with an open mind and zero knowledge of the story or characters. That being said, it probably would have been better if I had researched before watching and I will explain later.
STORY:
This starts off as a very well executed, extremely well paced story of transition, isolation and adaptation. It builds very well off of the character's plight and pathos, going from a well established life that include friendships and goals
                  into an unknown life where the future seems vague and uncertain for our protagonist and even the supporting characters.
Up until that point, which is only the first few episodes, I was honestly ready to give this a 9 or even a 10, the direction is excellent, the pacing is perfect and even the characters are well defined through actions more than through dialogue. This is very high quality stuff, but it seems that as soon as the setup is complete, the writers did not know what to do with the story because it collapses in on itself very quickly and we get a rehash of pretty much any modern vampire story. And make no mistake, this is a vampire story.
But I digress, the issue comes when after the first few episodes, the pacing completely falls flat, dragging for about half the series and then jumping into hyper drive in the last few episodes rather than gradually pacing the events as a good series would do. It culminates in one of the most anti climactic 'endings' I've seen for an anime series and I understand that there are more series after this one (Tokyo Ghoul root a follows I believe) but I am judging this one on its own merit rather than on the merit of the future episodes.
The story is incomplete, the characters begin as very relatable , understandable and even a bit mysterious but the series blows its load from being so excited that they become mockish cartoon cut-outs of what they started out as being. 
As always, that is the best non-spoiler review I can give for the story.
ART:
The art was serviceable. I found some of the establishing shots and a couple of the fight sequences to be absolutely beautiful, but for the most part the color palette is very drab and unfocused. I understand that the point was to take us from a bright cheerful world into a darker, unfocused world, I get it, I really do.... but in doing and focusing so intensely on setting the mood, they completely forget to draw us in through the artwork the way they did in the beginning of the series. 
Again it's as if they had a fantastic idea for a series but once they finished the setup, they had no idea what to do or how to do it.
CHARACTER:
As stated earlier, I found the characters to be interesting, unique, mysterious and well defined... at first. But then their actions completely defy all logic. Characters that are established as being untrustworthy or antagonists to the main cast are suddenly taking actions that contradict their previous development. It's just very poorly written and the characters have no consistency whatsoever after their initial setup. Again they are done very well at first and then after the story collapses, it just becomes a bunch of nonsense.
But worst of all; 
There is absolutely no consistency with the internal logic of the character strength. One character can get stabbed a good 40 times through the series (You'll know what I mean when you see it) and they'll be fine... whereas other characters are cut once and they're down for the count. I would guess that it has to do with weak points such as a part of the body or head... or perhaps even a special weapon that works against the Ghouls, but this is never established at all. It just so happens that some characters can randomly take, nearly insurmountable levels of punishment, whereas other characters cannot.
There is absolutely no consistency. This completely made me lose interest in most of the characters because I realized that whether a character dies or not is entirely at the mercy of the writers; I know this is true for all series but at least other series establish some rules that the writers must follow, here they're just blatantly making it up as they go along. It's terribly written.
ENJOYMENT:
I adored the first few episodes and if I had to review just those, I would not hesitate to give it a 10, but as the story, characters and even the art got worse as the series went along, I can only tell you that if you are like me and expect a good story to stay good, you will be disappointed. Your enjoyment will melt away with each episode.
OVERALL:
It earns a lot of points in my book for the first episodes. After that it just isn't any good.  I would not recommend this, nor will I watch the next series. It lost its nerve and threw away the magnificent levels of quality it set out to achieve.",4
"
                Tokyo Ghoul was one of those anime packed with action and adventure.  I felt the story was very intriguing and kept bringing me back to watch it every week.  The characters had their own unique personality and the art was a very delightful thing to watch.  HOWEVER I did not like the intense gore that was included in this anime.  I'm fine with stabbing and some violence in an anime I watch but this one was very violent.  The level of gorey-ness, as one may put it, was too much for me, which is why I didn't give it a
                  9 or 10.  
So if you dont mind the intense gore that this anime will bring, then go for it.  You will enjoy the anime.",8
"
                ""Tokyo Ghoul""; an anime that tends to devour the heart whole -- literally.
Being a dark/horror fantasy, this anime does a wondering job of capturing its audience. There are bloody fight scenes, and wonderful animation to go along with them.
Hanae, Natsuki, Kaneki's voice actor, is a surprisingly rare voice in the anime industry, but no less talented. He's probably most known for his role of Sakishima, Hikari (the main character in Nagi no Asukara). Out of the few roles he's had, he has voiced many characters, each of their voices differing. Hanae can be anyone from the unemotional robot in Kaizuka, Inaho (Aldnoah.Zero) to the wimpy
                  mess that is Kaneki, Ken. He plays Kaneki to a 'T', and makes our fragile character loveable. Other mentionable people are Amamiya, Sora (Kirishima, Touka) and Hanazawa, Kana (Kamishiro, Rize). Amamiya is another rare gem to have. She is also the voice of Akame (Akame ga Kill) and Fujimiya, Kaori (Issuukan Friends). Her heartfelt and tough portrayal of Touka, a strong but insecure ghoul, is beautiful. Amamiya also plays the role perfectly. Hanazawa also did a great job, but it's a bit odd to have the sweet Moriyama, Shiemi (Blue Exorcist) become this cold blooded binge eater of a ghoul. However, when Hanazawa goes dark, the voice suddenly fits Rize's character and sends chills down the back.
For such a hyped anime, ""Tokyo Ghoul"" certainly lived up to its expectations. The animation quality knocked out all other animes out of the park. It was unfortunate some of the more brutal scenes had to be censored. Moving onto the characters, they were diverse and believable. Kaneki was wimpy at points, but was not unbearable. Other characters like Rize and Touka were the perfect addition to the series. They held some strong female roles! There are many other characters, but watching the series would be better than reading about them from this review. But even the story was good! Ghouls were carefully thought out with how strong they could be, and the type of powers they held. It was even shown than humans could stand a fighting chance. Humans are no longer the weak and defenseless creature they're normally portrayed to be. The only problem with ""Tokyo Ghoul"" was its pacing. To my chagrin, the anime decided to skip important arcs located in the manga. This greatly disturbed the pace and made the show a little more than confusing at times. This anime really should have been two, twenty-five episodes seasons.
""Tokyo Ghoul"" is not an anime for the faint of heart. It is bloody, and it is violent. But those who have a strong mind and a love for fantasy will love it. I have mixed feelings about ""Tokyo Ghoul"", but I'm going to go ahead and say it will be one I never will forget. It has truly captivated my heart.

Story - 8
The story is very well scripted. It just flows like an anime should. However, the pacing is a little off and it's concerning that the anime skips arcs from the manga.
Art - 10
The artwork was actually one of the best this season. The character were detailed, and very pretty. The fighting scenes were excitingly horrific, in that they had blood, gore, and all things a good fight scene could have. Too bad stuff like decapitated bodies were censored.
Music - 10
From the OP to the ED, the music is just a work of brilliance. I practically have the song ""Unravel"" memorized, it was so good. And even though the ending song can't even compare to the opening song, that was also good in its own respect. But the OSTs are what really made the anime. The music fit so much that I can't even remember what kind of songs were playing. Very well done.
Character - 8
There was lots and lots of character development, as well as character reinforcement. I do wish that I had gotten to see more of side characters like Mr. Uta (Mask Guy) and Hide (Kaneki's best friend).
Enjoyment - 10
Every week, I would eagerly anticipate the next episode. ""Tokyo Ghoul"" never let me down -- not even once.
Overall - 9.2
This anime was a great addition to my 2014 Summer lineup. It reminds me a lot of a story I am working on, but holds a certain charm that keeps me hooked. This anime has everything a dark fantasy horror needs.",9

                Tokyo ghoul a 12 episode anime adaptation of the popular manga based around conflict in a world of ghouls and humans.  After reading the manga, it is hard to compare it to the anime as it is poorly executed with the shows character development and story. The show lacks detail which leaves many viewers confused and less sympathetic from what the producers were trying to achieve. This is done for the reasons of forcing 60 chapters into 12 episodes which is like driving on the freeway blindfolded.
The psychological aspect and dark atmosphere is what got me hooked as I was intrigued of seeing Kaneki
                  battle and struggle of living a half human/half ghoul. The cast size and overall pacing within the 12 episodes is its downfall. It was hard to have any sort of connection or emotion towards any of the characters. The animation was fun to watch with beautifully designed quinque and kagune (weapons). The opening and ending were great and fun to listen to as it described the tone perfectly.
Overall I did enjoy Tokyo ghoul as I love psychological – gore shows. Although I recommend reading the manga instead as it is so addicting to read.",7
"
                I'd received pretty good feedback about Tokyo Ghoul these past few months, but honestly the first ten episodes had me more than skeptical about the entire thing. The finale of the last episode is amazing; Ghoul Kaneki is really charismatic. The whole background thing and the scenes between Rize and Kaneki took too much of the episode in my opinion; the time they took up could have been used to show some of what happens later between Hide and Kaneki.
The opening song and final generics were pretty damn cool.
Final rating: 7/10. Disappointing for most of the series, but the last two/three episodes and the Finale
                  make up for that a little.
Original rating (after seeing Episode 1): 5/10.",7
"
                I'm not sure why I can't find a review with a 10/10 rating, so I had to make one.
the story takes place in a ghouls and humans kind of world; ken kaneki, a 19 year old freshman, half human - half ghoul.
Kaneki, the protagonist, struggles between his humanity, his morals and what he always believed in, and the way this reality is, and what things have gotten to be.
he finds himself in a whole new different kind of life, and a new self.
he's weak,with new doubts and questions and he doesn't show much courage toward what his has come to be, not as you'd expect
                  from a male mainstream-ish protagonist.
and all that, holds so much deepness to it. and from the very bottom, his character develops, and that's a 10/10 for me, that's everything.
the OST is perfect, the opening is stunning, and so well-performed. so is the ending, the sound in general is perfect.
the art is beautiful, and the animation is awesome.
and that's how it is to me.
give it a chance, and enjoy your what your decision has come to.",10

                A friend of mine had suggested we watch this back in October 2014 and I read an article about it in Otaku USA. Going in I was kind of so-so about it. The premise seemed interesting but I had heard it was pretty gory (which I'm not generally fond of).
The first 3-ish episodes were great and I couldn't really understand why it received an MA rating (Hulu). The next 6 episodes were okay. The last 3 I'm not sure what to say. A lot happened, there seemed to be a lot of unnecessary violence. There were a lot of unexplained happenings and then it ended
                  on a major cliff hanger.
I like the premise even if aspects of it are cliché at this point.
Ordinary guy leading boring life has an extraordinary life-altering experience that suddenly makes him interesting and important.
He must then learn how to live and survive in this new life.
---More In-Depth Summary (Spoilers)---
In this case Ken goes on a date with a red-head book worm and then agrees to walk her home. Turns out she's a ghoul and wants to slowly tear him apart and eat his flesh. Through a freak ""accident"" some steel beams fall on the both of them, killing her. Some unknown doctor harvests her organs and uses them to replace Ken's destroyed organs.
He wakes up in the hospital and is ""fine"" with the exception of all food making him ill. The medical staff doesn't seem at all concerned about this though and discharges him to return home. Once there he has mysterious urges, a mental battle with the girl that tried to kill him, realizes that all food now makes him sick, learns that one of his eyes now turns black and red, and comes to the conclusion that he's a ghoul.
He starves himself for awhile then wanders around town, almost kills some people, then comes across another ghoul eating a person in an alley. Another ghoul shows up claims the territory is his, then another ghoul shows up and says it's her territory. There's some fighting. She tries to force Ken to eat from the corpse which he refuses. She then brings him to the coffee shop where she lives which turns out to be a hide-out for ""peace-loving"" ghouls. Ken learns that the only things Ghouls can eat are flesh and coffee. He's then extended a job to work at the shop. He learns that the food these ghouls eat comes only from people who commit suicide. He's also taken to a seedy part of town to have a mask made to conceal his identity from ghoul hunters (CCG).
This whole section was really interesting and I wish they would have spent more time on it.
The human ghoul internal identity crisis that Ken goes through.
The ghouls destroy human families and the CCG destroy Ghoul families. 
That there are humans and ghouls that want to coexist and there are humans and ghouls that want to kill each other.
All of this was really interesting.
The next section wasn't as interesting. Some more characters join their party. We learn more about ghouls. Multiple characters try to kill Ken.
Then in the last three episodes all hell breaks loose and the MA rating becomes completely justifiable. 
I'm intrigued enough that I'll probably watch the second season but I feel like this series could have been so much better than it was.",7
"
                Note that this review covers both seasons.
During the start of the 2014 summer season, Tokyo Ghoul was one of the most hyped shows. This really doesn’t surprise me any as those first couple episodes were some of the most intense of any anime I’ve ever seen. I admit, I was a little leery going into this, as I’m not a fan of the horror genre, when it involves lots of violence and trying to scare me like that, so I was pleasantly surprised that instead it seemed to be a psychological horror, offering an incredibly powerful start. Of course, many shows don’t live up to
                  the standard they set for themselves early on, and while I loved the start of Ghoul, I also loved the start of Black Bullet and Brynhlder in the Darkness if that tells you anything. But those aren’t the show I’m talking about today, instead, I present to you my review of both seasons of Tokyo Ghoul.
Story
Tokyo Ghoul focuses on Kaneki, a young college student, which isn’t a high school student, so that immediately earns the show some points from me. He seems to be somewhat normal, a bit shy, bit of a book worm, he likes a girl who also seems to be a bit of a book worm. So, the two of them go on a date, and then she precedes to try eating him.
Oh yeah, did I mention that the world of Tokyo Ghoul is filled with Ghouls, creatures who look like normal humans, except they eat humans. And as luck would have it, Kaneki had a crush on a Ghoul who decides he would make a good snack. Of course, due to the magic of plot, he survives barely, she’s dies, and to save Kaneki, the doctor takes some organs out of her and puts them in him, so he survives, but then becomes a half ghoul himself. Now if you can ignore the huge amounts of plot convenience there and things that aren’t ever explained, you can then move onto the good parts of the story. 
We see Kaneki struggling with his new identity as a Ghoul. As I said before, Ghouls eat people, and while the instincts within him tell him that he needs to do so something that of course repulses him, and this is made worse by the fact that any other food tastes disgusting, except coffee because the plot says so. This battle within Kaneki is presently incredibly well at first, as he wants to survive, he wants to just continue his normal life as a human, but this soon proves difficult as he finds himself falling deeper into the world of the Ghouls. He finds shelter at a coffee shop run by some ghouls who have chosen to live as vegetarian, only eating the bodies of those already dead. 
There are other Ghouls and organizations of ghouls that end up becoming Kaneki’s enemy, so he wants to become stronger, taking advantage of the incredible physical strength Ghouls have along with their glowing red thing that I can’t remember the name of. It’s at this point the show shifts from a physiological horror to more of an action shonen, which really was disappointing. They also introduce the CCG, a police/military force created to fight and counter the ghouls. What I like about them as that for the most part, neither the ghouls nor the CCG are pure good or evil. Amon is the main focus from this group, and I really like his character, and the battle between him and Kaneki about two thirds the way through the first season is one of the best moments in the show. Of course, when it comes to intense scenes, I have to mention episode 12. It presents the torture Kaneki goes through, getting into his mind and showing who he is and who he wants to be, all leading to one of the most satisfying battles I have ever seen.
Unfortunately, Ghoul wasn’t able to keep up its intensity throughout the show. It was very rushed at times, and this really did hurt how engaged I was able to be throughout it. It’s second season Root A then completely ignored everything that made the first season good, focusing on way too many things at once to tell a good story. While many of these side plots could have been interesting if they were explored more, it was done in a way that none of it was engaging, and left me bored most of the time. The battles became lame, making the shaky build up to them just completely fall apart. The slice of life parts just seem to get in the way of what could be an interesting action series. There were a couple moments where the show seemed to remember it’s Psychological horror roots, but these were too few and far between to make up for these problems.
Characters
The characters don’t offer anything other than a couple. Once Kaneki gets over the panic at being a ghoul, he’s mostly an observer, bounced around the world of the ghouls to show the viewer what it’s like. While I do like his character, especially once we see his backstory and his transformation, after this transformation, he’s just there. He’s the main character, but in many ways becomes detached from the story.
The characters in the CCG I found a lot more interesting. Amon is my favorite from the show, a noble hardworking person who wants to fight the ghouls to protect humanity. Meeting Kaneki though seemed to make him question his black and white view of the world. Unfortunately the show, instead it seemed to move away from this plot point until the end. There are several other interesting characters in the CCG, but the only one I can talk about without spoiling much is Juuzou, the generic crazy likes to kill things type of character, and I liked him, he was fun to watch, and once we see where he came from, his twisted worldview really does make a lot of sense. He actually gets a bit of development too in the end, making him a great supporting character. There’s also Mado, who is one of the major villains for the first season, but it’s not until the second season that he really gets fleshed out, mainly from the perspective of his daughter, which was an interesting twist, but it felt like this was only done this way due to door planning.
All the other side characters were disappointments. Touka ended up just being someone who seemed love struck for Kaneki, Himari who I liked at first, just felt like an adopted little sister to Kaneki, Hide was just Kaneki’s old best friend. When Kaneki wasn’t around these characters, they just feel like they’re going in circles, not trying to do anything about what’s going on in the world. Hide could kind of be considered an exception, though he was so far removed from season 1 that his involvement in season 2 feels kind of out of place, even if he did have a role to play in the end.
Character wise, Ghoul definitely tried doing too much. It attempted to have a large diverse cast, but instead what we got was a whole bunch of flat characters that got little to no development, and when the time was spent more on these side characters as the show went on, it just fed into the other problems the show had.
Animation + Sound
The show’s animation is probably the most noticeable difference between the two seasons. The first season was as a whole pretty good, aside from the censorship, which I admit, didn’t bother me that much. The second season everything went downhill. Even the battle scenes which should be the best animation scenes were just bland, had no impact at all. I could get into this more, but I’ll just tell you to go watch Mr. Reckless Penguin’s videos on it, he’s far better at picking apart animation than I am. 
This really is disappointing, as the first season really looked good when it needed to, so it just doesn’t make any sense for it to be so bad in the second. It’s not like this is a small studio that doesn’t have any money; this is Studio Periot, the same one who does Naruto, and they’ve certainly been milking that one for all it’s worth.
The music for the show is also something that changed quite a bit between the two seasons, except this was one aspect of the show that improved. The first season’s music was largely unremarkable, able to enhance the show when needed, but nothing overly memorable. However, the second season had a couple insert songs which really did a wonderful job at conveying the tension and the uncertainty the characters felt, and these songs were so great they easily stand on their own, especially Glassy Sky and On My Own. I also like them because they’re in English, so I know what they’re saying without the need of subtitles or fandubs. 
The first opening for Ghoul is one of the best I’ve seen. Of course, this is contrasted by the second season’s opening, which is one of my least favorite openings ever. Just having a picture of the main character with pretty colors changing behind him to a generic song is not how you get someone excited for the show! Well, the song was kind of fitting, for the show, and it highlighted an event at the end of the show, but still, it was very underwhelming. Of course, considering how much of it was boring the second season was to begin with…maybe it was fitting after all.
I’ve only seen one episode of the Root A dub, so my judgment of that is a bit limited. Overall I’d say it was okay, the only stand out part being Todd Habberkorn as Ayato. The rest were somewhere along decent to meh. If you really prefer dubs, I’d like to say you’d be okay with it, but considering they haven’t dubbed the first season yet, they’re not really an option unless you want to jump in half way through the show, which I wouldn’t recommend.
Final Thoughts
The show is probably the best example of wasted potential I have ever seen. It had a great start, a couple plot holes maybe, but it had the perfect setup for a great physiological horror. If they could have kept that up, added in some action from time to time, fleshed out some broken characters and really explore the themes of being a monster and hating what you are it would have been something awesome.
Instead we got…I don’t even have words for it. Actually, I have lots of words, you’ve been listening to them for a while. So let’s switch to numbers instead, since I like numbers.

                This review is one sided and I would like to hear what made it good as I struggled to find what others loved it for
I came into this series with too higher expectations and this is why I am giving this awful review of this ""liked"" Tv series.
The reason why I despise this show is because I have read the manga for it before watching. I loved the manga but the show was a huge disappointment for me, as like a book being turned into a film in western context; there are huge holes left in the story.
If I didn't read the manga for me
                  it would've been like watching it without subtitles.
the only thing I can see that they did correct was the action and torture scenes, apart from that there was no known meaning behind some characters actions and without  the manga by my side I would've  given up before finishing the series.
what ruined this for me was my own hype for the anime before watching it. 
once again I'm sure its' good but I couldn't find any good points on my own
the only good part was the action and the end of the series was very unsatisfactory for me and has discouraged me from going on to the next season",6

                this is my first review ever, please let me know if i missed something 
before i begin, id just like to say that i hate to be /that person/ but please read the manga. i prefer to watch the anime rather than read the manga, but im glad i read tokyo ghoul or id have given this anime an even lower score. this story is elaborated upon so much more in the manga as well as the characters and the manga is actually really good ! im trying to be as unbiased as possible but its kinda hard when the anime is so crappy. 
story:
                  7/10 
the story of kaneki the ""social outcast"" isnt the most original thing ever but the ghoul community vs the ccg is pretty interesting and with the added opposition from the aogiri tree it made for a cool overall feel. however, while i was more excited to see the aogiri tree and white hair kaneki arc than the rest of it, i felt the anime should have took its time and gotten to there later rather than sooner. the anime rushed waaaaay too much and covered like 60 chapters in only 12 episodes, which left me disappointed and left the characters and plot with absolutely no development. who wants to watch an anime thats just fighting when you dont understand the reason for why they fight? 
art: 6.510 
i feel like im one of the few people that actually didnt like the art. the colors picked for it were ugly and dull compared to the official colors of the tokyo ghoul characters. the animation was sloppy most of the time and the fights werent too interesting to watch. i do give props to studio pierrot for making the kagunes look really cool though. they were probably the best part of the anime imo
sound: 3/10
THE OPENING WAS AWFUL. IT MADE ME WANT TO COVER MY EARS AND SCREAM. this honestly was not an overexaggeration like, the opening sucks so so so bad please i know theres a second season out and i really hope its opening doesnt suck as bad as this one. im the kind of person that leaves the page the second the ending starts unless its really good so ill be completely honest and say ive never heard more than 10 seconds of the ending but i didnt like those 10 seconds either. 
the voice acting was okay i guess, though it could be better. i didnt focus too much on that when giving it my score, so read another review on that. 
characters: 8/10 
characters were one of the mangas strong suits, so thats why im giving it such a high score even though theres like, zero character development in the anime. kaneki seems like a whiny bitch in the anime and he kind of is for the first bit of the manga but after a while he comes to realize that things arent in his favor and that he is in fact a ghoul. he puts his human life behind him and focuses more on surviving even when things are looking down on him and [spoilers] he gets tortured in some weirdo's house for a while before Finally kicking his ass and becoming this cool white haired guy. [end spoilers] he is able to fight for himself and isnt ashamed of his ghoul side anymore. the anime took away all of his good moments because studio pierrot wanted to get to the Cool White Haired Guy asap so they could rake in the cash. 
enjoyment: 5/10 
i watched the anime first, then while waiting for the next episode read the entire manga. after seeing how it all actually went down, it was really really hard to watch this anime and see such a good manga get butchered like that. not to mention i watched this only for the gore and the gore was overcensored to the point where you could barely see what was going on. 
so my advice is to watch this anime only if you dont love yourself/havent read the manga first. then once youre done the anime read the manga so that you too can realize how bad this is and regret wasting like 6 hours of your life watching it.",6

                İt's like Twilight with ghouls, reasons why:
1:There is a group of good ghouls and a group of bad ghouls. Bad ghouls eat live human but good ones only eat died people. Just like twilight In that movie bad ones was killing humans for blood but good ones were only drinking animal blood.
2:All ghouls get together against humans 
 In twilight all gay vampires get together against gay werewolfs.
3. At the start it was only ghouls vs ghouls and vampires vs vampires.
4. becoming ghoul and becoming vampire can save you from death while in danger (kaneki and the girl with no emotions in twilight had been
                  saved from death with becoming ghoul-vampire.",7
"
                B-tier horror movies can be quite fun. Filled with exaggerated acting, ridiculous scripts, and gratuitous gore, films like ‘Attack of the Killer Tomatoes’ are a riot to watch with friends. Unfortunately, unlike those movies, Tokyo Ghoul failed to embrace its schlocky identity and pretended to be as serious as a heart attack. 
Before developing a sad case of personality disorder, the anime was quite enjoyable. When the opening shot is of a purple-haired woman cackling maniacally, bathing, and drinking blood atop a pile of bodies, I knew I was in for a campy ride. After all, the DVD cover features Kaneki wearing a knock-off Bane
                  mask with a painted-on Cheshire grin. The first four episodes all but confirmed it. Delicious ham-and-cheese dialogue. Over-the-top expressions. The story’s main location is a coffee shop run by ghouls. A party of mask-wearing ghouls gush enthusiastically – almost with orgasmic delight – after smelling a blood-covered napkin. An obese, scarf-wearing minion with a lisp becomes the main dish at a banquet. Later on, a certain character steals a motorcycle and uses it to launch himself straight into the second floor of a building filled with ghouls. Laughing hysterically, he kills them all with an assault rifle as the motorcycle lands on the ground. Cue explosion. All these scenes are the distilled essence of Tokyo Ghoul: shocking, prurient and amusing. When the anime decided to transform into a drama, it became a tedious chore to keep on watching. Fortunately, not all was lost.
One particular character knew exactly in what kind of anime he was in, and, thus, single-handedly stole the show. Wearing an exquisite blood-red suit and sporting a très chic blue coif, Tsukiyama’s introduction is as understated as a bull in a china shop. In a scene dripping with homoerotic subtext, he sniffs Kaneki and says he smells wonderful. His eccentric mannerisms and awful French are c'est magnifique. Writers poured all their creativity into his dialogue and I could not get enough. At one point, without a trace of irony, he says, “I happen to taste very good” as he suggestively licks his lips. FORTISSIMO! Not only is Tsukiyama entertaining to watch, he is a strong, agile fighter and a worthy adversary. I sincerely wished he had been in more episodes.
However, all good things must come to an end. A dull narrative tone and uninspired script take over, repeating the blatantly obvious to the audience. Crystal-clear scenes that anyone possessing two neurons to rub together could understand, spelled out like a particularly bad Dora the Explorer episode. For example, Nishio (a ghoul) is casually chatting with his roommate, Hide (a human), as they eat together in episode two. Kaneki thinks, “I think it’s safe to assume that nobody suspects him of being a ghoul…” Thanks for that, I was so lost. While I might come across as overly harsh, my bluntness is a result of the story’s overindulgence in blatant exposition. The audience could clearly see that Nishio and Hide were wrapped up in their conversation, had easygoing smiles, and their body language was relaxed. There was no need for Kaneki’s thoughts to chime in unnecessarily, when a slightly surprised look would have sufficed. Writers either mixed up the classic refrain ‘show, don’t tell’, or they believed that the audience barely had a collective double-digit IQ.  There were also a few ham-fisted, superficial themes comparing the ethical quandaries between ghouls eating humans versus people devouring cows and pigs. Some ghouls look down on humans for eating multiple species to survive whereas they only eat one. These scenes bludgeon the morality to the head with all the subtlety and nuance of an explosive enema. 
Dialogue timing is also off. Characters give Hamlet-length monologues as they have their defenseless foe lying right in front of them. Mado talks about the different ghoul types’ weaknesses and strengths during a battle – which he himself is fighting. While the ghoul tries to rip him apart, he tells them what type they are; it comes across as unnatural. Koutarou Amon waits until a ghoul he knocks back to stand up before attacking again. What a gentleman. After the ghoul gains his bearings again, he goes on to ask why ghouls are so mean and evil and yadda, yadda, yadda… It interrupts the flow of the story and destroys all sense of tension.
The anime’s second half desperately tries to make us care for secondary characters that barely have any screen time. Casualties start to pile up on both sides of the human vs. ghouls war. Tokyo Ghoul wants the audience to feel sympathetic over both groups. As the episodes progressed, more minor characters die tragically. Yet, episodes 7 and 8 were some of the blandest episodes I ever had to sleep through. One certain character who had, at most, two conversations on-screen is murdered. The music, tone, direction, cinematography all try to present this as tragic. I drowsily close my eyes.  After napping for five minutes, I blearily try to pay attention to a new scene. Instead of outright destroying him, Touka asks one of the antagonists why he killed her acquaintance. My eyelids start to feel like lead again. There is a lot of crying, screaming and mourning. I struggle to remember who the hell died. An anime has significant characterization problems if I feel more emotionally invested in episode 9's pet parrot being washed up in the rain, than half its cast. 
As if that were not bad enough, the anime had the brilliant idea to tack on even more characters in the last three episodes. Given their uncanny resemblance to a clown car cavalcade, I will not bother with their names. After all, I will grant them the same amount of respect the anime gave them. We got the new Aogiri Tree ghouls like Blue-Haired Edge Lord, Angry Crescent-Moon Beard Guy, Mr. and Ms. Mummy Sidekicks, and the Rainbow Vault Dwellers. The CCG also had new faces like Mop Brush Bob, Oily Hair McSlick, That Other Dude, and Weird Billy the Scarecrow. The latter was the only one who was somewhat interesting. As for everybody else, it would be a miracle if I remember their faces ten minutes after I finish writing this review. Fortunately, it was not all bleak in the character department. Tokyo Ghoul did have a handful of characters that I cared about.
Kaneki steadfastly wants to retain the last shreds of his humanity, his inner fight at times both engrossing and annoying to watch. He cries and shouts about his all-consuming need for human flesh. Yet, when this moral quandary came up, I could not help but ask myself, ‘Why would eating human flesh be equivalent to throwing away his humanity?’ Before you all side-eye me, let me remind you that history is full of instances of people committing cannibalism under extreme, dangerous circumstances. In 1972, a Uruguayan rugby team had to resort to cannibalism after their plane crashed into the Andes Mountains. Obviously, I felt sympathy for him when he wondered if he had to murder people in order to survive…but eating corpses overcame that obstacle quite quickly. Nonetheless, he continues refusing and screams some more, and so my pity for him…dwindled.
Kaneki is, at times, quite the boring character, but not for the reasons you might think. There is nothing wrong with quiet, introspective, and deeply intelligent characters. In fact, I liked his shy and bookish qualities. Some of his best scenes involved him teaching a little girl, Hinami, advanced kanji. The way his eyes lit up at the mention of his favorite author, Takatsuki Sen, and his enthusiasm over the delicate prose in ‘Monochrome of Rainbows’ genuinely made me smile. It’s the English major in me. At times, he would agree with Touka when she said he was useless, but he is not as self-loathing as other similar characters before him. No, my main problem with Kaneki is that for someone who is as introverted and well-read as he is, his thoughts can be quite dumb and monotonous. As mentioned earlier, he is one of the worst offenders in pointing out the obvious. He narrates events, those recently unfolded just seconds beforehand, but with no flair. No pizzazz. No unique insight. Or worse, with downright stupidity. Take one of Kaneki’s worst bits of introspection from episode 8 as an example:
“Ghouls are stirring up trouble in this world…is that really true?” They are killing people, so I would say that’s affirmative, Chief.  “Ghouls have feelings too. Just like humans. Why can’t humans see that part of us?” Hard for them to see that part when they are getting their faces eaten off. “Why don’t they try to understand. It’s something so obvious, so simple…” Tell that to yourself five episodes ago when you were lambasting ghouls. “I’m the only who can realize it. Only me, the human….” Let’s forget the human-ghoul relationships that have been mentioned several times before in the narrative, shall we? While Kaneki has some characterization issues, he is not alone.
Sadly, there are very few female characters with any real development in the story. I became exasperated at seeing yet another woman becoming a damsel-in-distress or a victim to spur the heroes on. Touka might be the one and only exception in the female character arc department. She has some tsundere qualities in the beginning, but starts caring for Kaneki by the end. Sure, she beats him up when he complains about his newfound half-ghoul identity for the millionth time, but she puts her life on the line for her friends. Her cold and ruthless personality is one forged out of desire for vengeance. She is also one of the stronger ghouls in the show, which I appreciate. I wish the story showed other facets to her personality, as well as fleshed out her backstory, but…alas. 
Rize is the only other major female character in the show…and she is barely on screen. Despite that, her mysterious backstory and persona drives the plot for the last couple of episodes. She is sadistic, bloodthirsty, manipulative, and takes great delight in pointing out Kaneki’s weaknesses, “Whose fault is it that things ended up like this? Coincidence? Accident? Fate?  There is no such thing as fate. It is simply a combination of one’s circumstance. And who creates those circumstances. Who? It’s you.” While she is an important character, and much of her true story hasn’t been revealed yet, I couldn’t care less about her. Despite having more screen time in the last few episodes, she still remained as flat as an iron board. 
Yoriko, Hinami, and Hide serve as sentimental catalysts for the main characters. Kaneki and Hinami bond over their love for literature, particularly the short story ‘Showers at Sunset’.  As mentioned earlier, their brother-sister bonding were some of the scenes I liked the most in the anime. She does not have much of a personality, asides from being a sweet pacifist who likes to read. Hide is the total opposite of Kaneki: loud, brash, and outgoing –and yet, they have been best friends since childhood. It is a shame that the plot shafted him. Lastly, there is Yoriko, Touka’s dear friend. She cooks her food that makes her want to hurl. That’s about it for her.
There are other characters in Tokyo Ghoul, but I either wanted to kick their ass (like Nishio), preferred to get a root canal done over watching them speak (like detective Koutarou Amon), or hoped that they would fall into an active volcano (like Mado or Jason). Are they all vital characters to the plot? Absolutely. Did I like them? I would jump at an opportunity to shoot them straight into the surface of the sun.  
While Tokyo Ghoul’s characterization and narrative structure is subpar, the cinematography sure is not.  There are some breathtaking wide shots here, such as a villain juxtaposed against a psychedelic, multicolor aquarium with koi fish and water gushing out in the first episode. Or how about that vast field of white carnations blooming blood-red? Not only does the show have wonderful visuals, its camera angles and choreography are also something to write home about. The last fight was impressive, adrenaline inducing, and had some astounding high-angled POV shots plus low, tight camera angles during an incoming attack.    
I want to marry the OP, ‘Unravel’. It has a great piano piece, coupled with an electric guitar using a fuzz pedal distortion effect. By the middle of the song, the drummer builds up a crescendo, just as the string ensemble delivers magnificently. The singer’s – Toru Kitajima’s – voice is full of grief and pain, as he belts out powerfully, “In this twisted world, I’m gradually growing transparent and vanishing. /Don’t look for me; don’t look at me. /I don’t wish to hurt you in someone else’s imaginary world. /Remember who I am.” Not only does the OP have strong lyrics and musical composition, the graphics are fantastic. The characters all stand on a surface gorgeously reflecting the sky, like the Bolivian salt flats during rainy season. I would even be bold enough to say that this is one of the best OPs in the last 10 years. 
Asides from that musical gem, the OST is quite strong. There are beautiful classical instrumentals with haunting vocals during tense moments. Industrial, Nine Inch Nails-lite music plays when ghouls and humans are fighting. Unfortunately, not everything is stellar. A man who sounds like he took a swig of whiskey, and popped a handful of Xanax, before an intern hurriedly thrust him into the recording booth, sings the ED. As he croons, Deviantart fanart flashes on-screen (but not like the crappy Pokémon drawings I made in sixth grade, more like the pretty ones shown on Daily Deviations). Competent voice actors star in Tokyo Ghoul, but Mamoru Miyano did a standout performance as Tsukiyama. Simply phenomenal.
Tokyo Ghoul ends on a cliffhanger. Had there not been any future seasons, I would have deemed this a complete waste of time. Given that there are sequels, I deem this a partial waste of time. 
With that important knowledge in hand, the important question I pose to all three of you reading this review and myself is the following: 
Does this cliffhanger make viewers want to watch future seasons? 
The biggest compliment I can give Tokyo Ghoul is that, despite its many flaws, I can answer: “Yeah, sure, why the hell not?” 
Recommended to anyone interested in watching a grim struggle for survival between ghouls and huma– OSHIEEETEEEE YOOO OSHIEEEETEEEE YOOO/SONO SHIKUMI WOOOOO/BOKU NO NAKA NIIIIIII/DARE GA IRU NOOOO?",4

                This is my first review in MAL. Many reviews that I have read either give too long or not enough so I will try my best to provide enough yet short review without any spoilers.
Tokyo Ghoul or Tokyo Kushu mainly set around a boy name Kaneki Ken. His world is filled with fear of ghouls, a man eating being. He was a plain citizen that fear ghouls until he meet Rize. 
Story: 5
To be honest I was bored half-way through the anime, only to be excited in some parts throughout all the episodes. It is the usual plot that shounen anime often have. The character
                  encounters something new and it change their fate. They then must struggle to understand the meaning of why did they end up like they are now. In TK Kaneki is similarly like it.
Art: 7
The overall art was okay. However, I just love it how the made the battle scenes. The blood effects, the invert and the sensors were put perfectly to enable the viewers to still feel the full feeling of it. The speed of the fight was fast yet the detail was not missed. Especially the details on their wounds and movements they make.
Sound: 8
To me the opening fits the plot very well. So implementing it to the anime would really give the vibe of what's the battle like to us, viewers. As I wrote, I love their battle scenes. The sound of the music in the background when they fight give off a perfect mix of how the character feels about themselves and the fight with each other. 
Character: 10
The character development here is just too awesome to describe. I love Kaneki's character development. You can say he went from a coward to a super badass. In the anime you might realize he often cannot decide what to do. Yet after his decision he was able to unleash the power in him. Other character's development was also very interesting. Their struggle to obtain their place in the world and their view about the world were somewhat changed by meeting Kaneki.
Overall: 8
If the plot was better and more interesting I would most likely give it a 10. Even though I got bored most of the time, in the end it became my most favorite anime. If you have a 'who am I?' psychology problem, you probably can relate to Kaneki here the most and to other characters as well. This anime somewhat represent the injustice to some group of people in the society…
Well that's my opinion. Hope this helps (^U^)v",8

                I personally really like this anime, it's got a lot of action and an interesting plot to make you want to just keep watching(and I mean literally, I stayed up all night watching it XD). The art style is also very nice and I find that often in anime it's either to gory or there's no blood and guts at all, whereas in Tokyo Ghoul you do get the occasional decapitation or maybe someone gets ripped in half, while still being enjoyable to watch. I'd also recommend the second season beacause the second seasons of many animes I have watched are just unnecessary and ruin
                  the first one, however in Tokyo Ghoul Root A it takes the loose ends of the first season and ties them up neatly.(Even though I did in fact find the end slightly disappointing I enjoyed this anime immensely and am going to have a hard time finding one that will interest me this much).",9
"
                What an interesting concept for an anime, I had high hopes for it to be good, but that is not at all how i felt in the end. I am not sure how to review this anime because I have too many mixed feelings about it. It was not what I was expecting, and not in a good way. I have seen so much hype for this anime, which is one of the reasons I watched it in the first place. However, my expectation were shot down into the depths of no return with utter dismay. The only saving grace for this series was the
                  last episode, no joke that was the best episode and had me saying ""finally, something good!"" I will say the first episode is interesting too because it grabbed my  attention, wanting me to continue the series. But no, after the first episode the rest of the season was a snooze fest and the story was all mixed up and confusing that I did not understand what was going on half the time. I only kept watching because I wanted to see the main character, Kaneki, go super saiyan because I knew it would be crazy epic,  but of course that didn't happen. It would have made the anime much more interesting if Kaneki went bat sh!!t crazy from the get go, or at least half way through the series; but instead they decided to make him a whiny kid that cried almost EVERY episode, seriously I think it was every episode. Though I will admit I understand why he was that way, fighting the demons inside himself and trying to keep his humanity, but still no excuse. I wish he had been more compelling because the other characters were just as bad, if not more useless. Honestly, some of them had no need to be part of the story because they did not have any serious impact to make any difference. Nonetheless, there were a few appealing moments where they make you stop and think about how cruel the world can be and how things never change. It was quite eye opening in those brief moments of inspirational thought, but they unfortunately were overcast by the slow haul of a story that they were almost forgotten. 
Overall, the story is interesting but the way it was executed was not pleasant. It dragged on to the point where I almost ripped my eyes out up until the very end. The art is actually quite nice, but seriously there was NO NEED for censorship. The so called blood and gore was nothing and having it censored, I believe, took away from the whole experience. The music was decent, but not very moving as I was anticipating. The characters, just were bland and many had no reason to be a part of the story because they made no significant influence. The enjoyment was there but was slowly cast away trying to get through the series, until the very end the spark came back. This anime could have been done SO much better, it could have been beautiful in more ways than one, but has left me in complete disappointment.",5

dis anime be adapted from the young blood manga tokyo ghoul.  dem manga far shine the anime by a long shot, but what a do.  the storyline change didnt botter me dat much butt what relaly pooper peeved me was thos BIG BLACK BARS on my screen.  it reminded more of hentai more than anything when shit was suppoz to get reeal.
like i said the story was aight even tho they changed it up a bit butt what really botterd me was how day ended the dam thing.  i was litterally left clueless at the end of episode 12.  i
                  didnt think the series ended yet, but after waiting a week i was like HOLY SHIT that was really the end and i had to rewatch it... and then proseed to watch it.  but i high like 420/420 recomend u to read the manga if u are interested.  its okay if they ended it all so sudden becuz the ended obviously hinted at a second season so it doesn't leave the watcher all ??? cunfused.
the big black bars realy coloncrucified all the gore but they went a little too overbored with tat shit, but otter den that it art wasnt bad.  the animation wass a great and the fight scenes were did good well!!
music is sugoii best!! ling ting sugite is best japan band and i would always listen to the opening just cause great music is great anime.  the anime has a notible sound track outside of the opening.  many times i could enjoy the mood much butter den tha mangaa with a very fitting soundtrack.
characters nothin special. useless shounen boy unlock powers and is super op with super potential.  tsundere emo chick pretend not to like u but deep down we knkow she like u, old sensei who take u in to his crib and he is probably super op and will do anything to prtect the young, and small loligrill who super useless but you know loli.  and typical antagonist archtype with flaming homo,  creepy old dude, BDSM torchure man.
but the flaws didnt kill the anime.  no no no, this is good watch depsite the BIG BLACK F**KING BARS and the stupid cliffhanger which really hypes up second season, it was enjoiable grate and would watch again.
overall this is good to start, if they have a second season to redeem themselvv then ;) ;) ;) maybe i bump the review but otter then dat its enjoible andu shood read mangaa if u lik this",8

                An anime that has a very cool and interesting story about a teen that lives in Tokyo where these creatures called ghouls have to eat human flesh in order to survive because ordinary food is not enough. The thing that got me hooked to this anime was the fight scenes and the cool characters that goes with it. Tokyo ghoul is not an anime you want to miss.
Story- The story is more to it then just a bunch of ghouls running around tokyo and killing people, is more about how society doesn't accept ghouls so they are hunted down by the law. Is about survival
                  in a place where you aren't accepted because you're different and about how to deal with being different in a wolrd so cruel. If that interest you then Tokyo ghoul is for you. Love every minute of the story as it goes on and made me want to watch more.
Art- Amazing visualization that excel at looking great. Expectially in the fight scenes.
Sound- Sound was good I just didin't like the choice of music in some of the scenes. I though it felt out of place it didn't need to be there. I just wanted to hear what they were saying and not some music in the background. I did like the music they used for the fight scenes. They could of done a better job at sound editing.
Character- They were all great in their own ways. Some were funny, some were quicky, I mean they all have something interesting to bring to the table. I got to admit that some of the characters weren't relatable. You don't feel a connection with them only the protagonist. That's something that I felt was a let down. Like none of the characters has a strong bond except for Ken and his best friend Hide.
Enjoyment- Had a great time with this anime, with the fight scenes and the cool characters that you just want to know more about them, and of course the story which is interesting. Tokyo Ghoul did wonder for me and I hope it does for you. I recommend it to all anime fans.",8

                Just imagine this, it is the first time you were in another world and you don't know anything. All you know is that the world is dangerous and that being there is no laughing matter. Well, that's how Tokyo Ghoul is to me, seeing Kaneki trying to fit into the new world he's in can actually make you realize a thing or two about the real world as well. The reason is because Kaneki is like a newborn baby suddenly being thrown into a dangerous and deadly world, of course, without doubt he will freak out. Then there's the fact about friends, that you should
                  treasure them because they are precious to you. 
The story of Tokyo ghoul is not a let down, its interesting enough to keep me, an anime watcher who quite hate an anime where the main starts at zero and works his way up to the top. It is interesting because the way the anime adapts real life problems by using ghouls is amazing. So from this, I can actually learn about the scary world of adults and corruption, a good anime to learn from. 
The art is not that bad either. the actions of the ghouls fighting with their kakuja and stuff is amazing. The way they try to depict the fight scenes as realistic as possible is what makes it amazing. So overall the animation is no problem. 
The soundtrack of the anime is amazing, it gives background sound to enhance how the character feels at a particular scene. If it's anger then the soundtrack follows, if its pity the soundtrack also follows. The soundtrack is also a good soundtrack to listen to without having the animation, especially the opening. This anime opening is my first opening where I can't just skip it every time I watch an episode. So in my opinion the soundtrack is top notch. 
The character is just so amazing that I have lots to say. First of all the way they pick a seiyuu that have a voice that can be hysterical at the worst, is just super amazing. Hanae Natsuki is like the best seiyuu that they could get to act out a hysterical boy trying to adapt to a new environment, but in a very scaredy cat way. The other characters as well doesn't disappoint. also each villain in this anime also really acts like a villain and not half-half. 
Overall this anime is such a good anime for a psychological and supernatural anime mix with school. The ending of the anime makes you want to watch the last episode over and over again because you know the second season will not be coming any time soon. So its a great anime for a first timer in anime and its also a good anime for those of you who like gory or bloody because without blood this anime wouldn't be called Tokyo Ghoul, so blood plays an important role in this anime.",9

                If you're a fan of anime chances are you've heard of the recent series Tokyo Ghoul. This Dark Fantasy/action series has gotten a lot of hype lately, perhaps overhype to be more accurate. While I did enjoy watching the short series, there were many flaws which stopped the anime from reaching its full potential. Now i'm going to say this first, I have not yet read the manga..i'm simply basing the review on the anime itself without comparing the show to its manga counterpart. 
Now as I said before it's not a stretch to say Tokyo Ghoul is overhyped. Why? I don't know. Nevertheless there
                  is a lot of potential for the series to perhaps get better when the second season comes around in January. These 12 episodes though suffer from feeling a bit rushed and cramped together, like the studio felt they needed to squeeze as much as they can into these 12 episodes and that certainly hurt the show. Why? Lack of character development, and scenarios and conflicts which are solved fairly quickly before the show rushes on to the next thing. This does eliminate boring filler-like episodes, but I wish I saw characters like Touka, developed more because she was a badass for the time she was given. Another thing the show lacks is a proper goal or ""thing"" the characters are working towards. For example trying to take down a villain or obtain an objective or like I said a goal. There are a number of antagonists but none of them really feel like a main villain, they feel more like just an enemy for Kaneki and Anteiku to deal with for a few episodes. That said, one of the antagonists in particular actually played a good bad guy; Jason. Towards the finale, you really start to see how he gets into Kaneki's head and make him crack. The amount of emotion that the show hits you with in the last episode was actually incredible. It really makes you feel like you're going through what Kaneki is and that's a quality I wish I saw more. Aside from all that, Tokyo Ghoul lacks a good cast of supporting characters as well. I can't help but to think that this is partially because they crammed 60 chapters into 12 episodes. Hide, Kaneki's best friend is seen a good amount in the beginning but then feels pushed aside and not really relevant towards the end. Some of the other Ghouls who act as supporting characters weren't as well fleshed out as they could've been which is disappointing as well. Nishiki was in my opinion a very interesting character and he was explored in the beginning but after that we don't see too much of him either. At times, the show try's to make you feel bad about a situation a character is going through and to be honest it just didn't work. The series tries to develop Amon as a connectable character but I didn't see a reason to feel bad for him all to much.
That all being said, there is a number of things Tokyo Ghoul does very well. The intro song-unravel by Tk is a beautiful song that fits the tone of the show perfectly. In all honesty It's definitely contender for best anime intro of the season so far. The soundtrack itself doesn't stand out as being anything special though, however it still blends well with the specific sequences and seems to add good rhythm to whatever was going on in the episode. Speaking of episodes, episodes 11, and 12 are by far the stand out of the series. The whole raid scene in episode 11 was fantastic and got my hyped. Due to shortness of time though, there's only so much of it we could see and I admit I wish I saw more. The emotional roller coaster of episode 12 was done very well too, especially the ending fight which was short lived but mildly epic. The animation goes without saying as being gorgeous. Character designs aren't anything ambitious but they did what they needed too. The environments though were the standout of the animation. The city of Tokyo was so detailed and lush looking the CGI was implemented perfectly. Action scenes had good flow and designs of the ghoul weapons- Kagune, looked pretty interesting though they're not completely different from something I haven't already seen. Another thing the show has going for it is the main character, Kaneki. He grew as a character and was developed the best. The show does a good job at putting everything in his perspective and not straying away from that, you see him grow and change especially at the end. The characters aren't interesting enough to drive the story completely but the story itself is for the most part interesting. I can say there was never a time the show bored me. Tokyo Ghoul also does a good job at putting you in this grey area of right and wrong. It's obviously wrong to kill people but is it so wrong for the ghouls to just be alive? Those are some themes sprinkled throughout the series.
Overall I enjoyed the series.. sticking to my guns though, the show has many flaws the next season hopefully fixes. I hope they're fixed anyway because I enjoyed the show and want it to get better next time around. Tokyo Ghoul is nothing great but it's certainly worth the watch. If you like Dark Fantasy or action i'd say that you'll enjoy it. If you're looking for something strictly horror though, you're not gonna find much here. Anyway, apologies for the lengthly review but please give it a thumbs up if you agreed !",7
"
                Note: I am writing from the point of view of a person who haven't touched the manga at all before diving in to the anime.
I first get to know Tokyo Ghoul from a friend who recommends it to me. Although it is stated horror as the genre I decided to gamble and watch... and honestly I get more than what I expected. I am currently reading the manga to catch up (and because I just can't wait for the second season teehee) Here are what I think..
Story 7/10
Honestly having a character which is half human and half something else (that is not human) is not
                  so original anymore. However Tokyo Ghoul (I'm referring to both manga and anime) did good execution in the setting. Ghouls, who somewhat like vampires who can't survive without human meat and blood, were first portrayed as the bad guys... but when our protagonist Kaneki got into an accident and transformed into a half ghoul, it appears that ghouls are not what humans think they are. Ghouls have feelings too, they have family, friends, they also have their own internal problems.. The exploration on both human and ghoul sides are done very well, making us the audience who knows what happened on both sides got agitated (at least I did) hoping they will somehow get to understand each other because they do have some similarities.
The story starts light in the cafe but starts gripping into you, deeper and deeper. Both manga and anime manage to mess with your psychology and emotions, definitely not something you will forget. I do notice they decided to switch the arcs, but as someone who watch anime first then reads, it doesn't matter so much to me.
Character 7/10
Honestly I feel the character design for main characters might be quite generic (at least for Kaneki and Touka), but not the characters themselves. Kaneki is introduced as shy, somewhat closed yet kind-hearted, somewhat naive and always blaming himself, but when we got to know him and his back story, it makes sense why he acts like that. In the end of the anime he got major character - I won't say development, it's a - transformation, and the reasoning I can accept it.
I find Touka is somewhat typical bad-ass hot-tempered girl. I am okay with some characters and I do hate several.. the good thing is Tokyo Ghoul have a wide range of characters. All the characters here, no matter how annoying they might be, have roles to play to Kaneki's growth as well as moving the story forward. I'm still reading so I'm waiting for some more surprise and revelation.
Art 8/10
It has very interesting art.  While the drawings in the manga are good, making it into colored, moving images and animated makes it even better especially in action scenes. I like how the color contrasts greatly on each other and darker colors - there's a word for it, ""chiaroscuro"" if you know art and drawing. It suits the mood of the show, which is dark and somewhat grey. 
I didn't expect Studio Pierrot to produce something like this so well (coughnarutobleachcough). The character design are the same with the manga which is very relieving for the manga readers. Animation are mostly good, battle scenes with kagune and quinques are smooth... effects like explosions, sparks, rain are well-done too, although I kinda annoyed with the sensors - black or white spots suddenly popping here and there (while in the same time I'm quite saved by it since I got a weak heart) 
Sound 8/10
Another good aspect about this anime is... the sound. The opening is very good! It's catchy (still playing in my mind until now) also the meaning of the song lyrics fits perfectly with Kaneki and what this show is about. The OST are quite ok.. 
I give so high marks for sound in respect of the seiyuus - Kaneki's seiyuu's Natsuki Hanae-san in particular.. in the last 3 episodes his voice acting really got me to feel Kaneki's emotions (ok I'll stop here so I won't spoil..) 
Enjoyment & Overall 8/10
It's been a while I watched such intense and emotional anime.. I am amazed and horrified by it in the same time, but overall I enjoy it. It is not a horror where there are scary ghosts, it's more on psychological with disturbing gruesome scenes that stir your emotion.
If you haven't read the manga at all, I suggest you watch first then read. That way you will enjoy it better because Tokyo Ghoul is, in my opinion, a good anime and as you read you will find out more about the characters, details and explanations which are all dropped in the anime.
If you have read the manga, lower your expectation and just enjoy the show~",8
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is probably the finest example of a show that fails to faithfully adapt its source material.
Back in 2014 when I first viewed this show, I was immersed in the story that unfolded before my eyes. It never occured to me that Studio Pierrot had neglected the manga and what could have been a masterpiece ended up being an ""okay show"" at best.
As with any review, I try to limit it within 500 words. Short but sweet as per say.
SOUND 7/10
Opening was definitely one of the more memorable ones for the show. UNRAVEL was a song that summed up the show perfectly and really
                  turned into a viral hit. I got nothing to complain about when it comes to the sub and dub, both were up to a solid standard and deserve praise. The OST is forgettable to say the least. Nothing really stood out or felt out of place either. 
ART/ANIMATION 7/10
Studio Pierrot have never been known for setting the bench mark in terms of animation. (AHEM Naruto & Bleach). I believe the show does a better job that the two I mentioned but it is still nothing spectular. It was consistent for the most part but nothing to write home about.
I am gonna praise the art for adding to the show. Enviroments had a dark vibe which really added to the enviroments and made the ghouls kagunes really stand out in their battle sequences, especially Toukas. More so the openings choreography was spectacular.
STORY/CHARACTERS (4/10)
Remember what I said about not adapting a quality manga correctly? Well this is where the studio messed up monumentally. The anime chops and skips important character development and leaves us baffled - thankfully not as much as the second season, but well we won't talk about that trainwreck. To this day I am still questioning why the show ended where it did, there was no closure and I cant really say that it was an effective cliff hanger either; It just left you thinking WTF!
Even with this average adaption, the characters still shine - that should show you the quality of these written characters and what potential there was to build on them. Kaneki is someone you genuinely sympathise for, Touka is the big sister bad ass that you wish you had and Hide is that Loyal friend who seriously lacks screentime, and the rest of the supporting staff share the same fate as Hide, a lack of screen time. I guess this cannot be helped due the small amount of episodes given.
OVERALL (5/10)
Some parting thoughts...
Tokyo Ghoul really is a story of what might have been, hopefully Madhouse pick it up and faithfully adapt this story. There is so much untapped potential in the show. Lets forget about Root A, that makes the first season of Tokyo Ghoul look like a literate godsend from the heavens.",5
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is a great anime for fans of the genre ""gore"", I type! The work presents gory themes and even controversial, however, the lack of truly remarkable characters in my view and especially the conduct of the end of the anime, for me I read the manga, it was a drug, downgraded a little anime. 
I'm not saying that the ending was bad, far from it, because the struggle Kaneki and Jason was amazing in the anime! But still, the final phase of the anime was very poorly explained and summarized unnecessarily.
Regarding the characters ... I particularly enjoyed the few characters in Tokyo Ghoul!
                  Not that the characters are bad, weak in combat or something, but lacked the charisma overwhelming majority, after all, the ones who had something else in relation to others - in my view - were Rize, Uta and Suzuya! 
The soundtrack is spectacular! Especially the opening, whose letter went almost exactly the emotional and psychological state of Kaneki ... but ... does seem a shoujo anime (romantic)! Despite incredible, the songs are not exactly the idea of the anime (blood, ""cannibalism"", sadism, psychopathy).
The design, the graphics and art as a whole are simply extraordinary! It is essentially a romantic and ""sweet"" graphic, but that's exactly what makes Tokyo Ghoul such a psychedelic anime ... contrast that art form, between violent and beautiful is something perfect! No more words: art is so perfectly absurd! 
. 
. 
The anime is great, but it lacked a better development in the story, like in the manga. The soundtrack is perfect, but it did not fit extamente the plot and the themes presented. Aside from Rize, Uta and Suzuya, none of the characters really draws attention to the charism, not even the protagonist, but still the cast is, um, good. I have made clear that art is absurd and perfect! Summing it all my private note to Tokyo Ghoul is 8, especially for the characters! 
PS .: A friend asked me to speak of Amon. I hate him ... for me he is the weakest character - in the sense of charisma, history and even the dialogues - the whole anime. '-'",8

                Change. We all experience it. but Kaneki knows how it actually feels better than anyone else. It is indeed very scary, but becoming 'someone' you're not is better than dying in vain. That is something Kaneki is hoping to believe. 
Tokyo Ghoul is indeed a very popular animation, adapted by its manga, becoming more and more well-known across the globe. I happened to find out about Tokyo Ghoul on Tumblr, with all the endless amazing and bad ass fan arts of the characters, i decided to give it a try.
The main plot of this story is about the two different types of citizens living in
                  Tokyo, the human and the ghoul. Being aware of each other, they live a very careful life. The human avoided being eaten by the ghoul, while the ghoul hide themselves from being captured by humans. 
Kaneki was once a very ordinary boy, living a dull boring life, but that drastically changed overnight. What was he like ? Why did his life change ? How does he cope with it ? The answers lie within his journey. Vampire and ghoul are two very mainstream animation idea, that's what makes it hard to turn the idea around and create something original. Would you like the animation and keep on watching or would you do the opposite ? The answer is yours to decide.  But it is totally possible for you to click the 'next episode' because honestly, what's not to like about it ? 
A boy living with ghoul's organs only to become, probably the most powerful and unique ghoul around, the somewhat gory scenes, the amazing plot. Still not convinced enough to watch it ? Did I mention about the bad ass and cool looking female protagonist ? I just did.
As much as i love the anime, i do have something about one of the character that disappoint me a little bit at the beginning. The male ghoul named Uta. His cool fan arts on tumblr could be the reason why i started watching, (although i keep on going because of the story itself), i expected him to be as bad ass as in the fan arts, but he is more of a polite guy, and possibly a little shy. Nevertheless, i happen to love him anyway. 
I'm very looking forward to the second season. The ending of season 1 will leave you wanting more because of the cliffhanger, so the continuation must be breathtaking.",9

                Tokyo ghoul it's a show that talks about ""Ghouls"" some sort of half humans, they look like us except in one thing: They have to eat humans to survive. 
Yeah .. it sounds like a horrible show with tones of blood and disgusting parts (like they eating the humans) .. but no it is not such thing. 
When we look at the synopsis, we may think that it would be a terrible anime in the way that it would have to many blood coming out of dead bodies while watching the ghouls eating them with pleasure .. a really sick plot but i repeat, IT
                  ISN´T. 
They censured the bloodie parts and when it comes to eat the humans, they do not show that part (except in the first episodes) then we no longer see it or it's censured. So don´t worry if you think that this show would scare you out becuase of this ""sick"" theme. 
Talking about the art, it's a normal art. Substancial design, i didn´t thinked it was to great, but the characters are solid, well made and with bright colors wich make them look nice.  
The story, well we definitely have a nice plot with the ""Ghouls"" and related things to him (like their kagunes. Kagunes are some sort of weapon that changes in every Ghoul, and it allows them to fight against each others). But, just that is different .. all the rest is just nice. We have the usual badass girl (Touka), the anoying protagonist that fights for peace (it seems like a character from a shonen) and the others are pretty much the same as the others secondary characters look like in other animes. Although, due to the fact that they are ghouls, we find out that they have a nice history behind them, wich creates a good character developement even though it is small, it's enough to make us care, even for a litle bit, in the drama. 
The sound .. i found it OK .. it is quite enjoyable, fits with the plot but nothing else besides that.  
Overall, it is an ejoyable anime, the second season is now being released so chek this one and if you liked the plot, you will have the pleasure to follow up this show. According to the first episode of the second season, we will have a better show then Tokyo Ghoul first season xD. 
Feedback from you would be nice .. i've been working on my reviews, and i suppose that i'm getting better, but nothing is better then the feedback from the readers. I always try to be as objective as i can so that you can see from my reviews, if the anime worth or not. But i'm having the feeling that i'm not beeing able to it correctly so give me some feedback if you have something to say.",8

                It's like I have no idea what happened, a story with a great idea was displayed far worse than what it could have been. I never read the manga but from what I hear it's far better than the anime. It feels like they rushed the anime yet they waste a whole episode on the makings of coffee while skipping the more relevant and enjoying parts of the manga they could have added.
Story - It's about a wimpy kid struggling to keep his humanity as a ghoul. The main character Kaneki lives in a world where humans are the majority and ghouls survive by eating
                  them. Due to what I would say a lucky turn of events, Kaneki lives his encounter and becomes one of these ghouls. The ending was pretty bad for an ending, but it was the best episode of the season. I can't say more without spoiling it but the ending of it basically changed the whole plot of ""Trying to maintain humanity"" to ""Lets just give in to it"". I have no idea if season 2 will come out, but at this rate I hope not, they ruined what it could have been, don't force more.
Art - Art is good modern style, nothing you can really complain about with the art, its well done, the animation is well done as well.
Sound - the opening is pretty good, can't really think of much to say about it, nice to hear but nothing stands out.
Character - The characters aren't anything unique, like many other anime before it, the main character is a complete wimp and the main female of the anime is a cute tomboy girl that picks up his slack.
Enjoyment - It is enjoyable to watch when you have nothing else to do or watch other than this. It does get annoying watching a wimpy character constantly cry in every episode.
Overall - 6/10 - could have been much better.",6
"
                When a human being is born it tends toward a certain nature by its gestures,behaviour and decisions. It starts with things that others see as minor and unsignificant.. yet they are clearly a sign as to what kind of individual that person will be. The next part is the acceptance of that nature by the human itself and the relatives.
The action in Tokyo Ghoul takes place in the city that partially names the anime and is about the rebirth of the protagonist which struggles while attempting to cling to the nature of human despite having turned into a ghoul, a flesh-devouring human with enhanced physical
                  capabilities. He refuses to acknowledge that he is human no more and ultimately ends up suffering for it as much as his acquaintances.
The things the artists managed to achieve using shades and colors is amazing, maybe because important scenes take place at night or in enclosed spaces where those two elements of artwork are essential, also being action-oriented some dynamics are required to a modest to excellent degree which this series did not fail to supply.
Characters are a variety of personalities that are mostly ghouls that have accepted and are content with living like that. All of them have sad tales as to how they became as they are now and are an element of focus based on the episodes. They are all made in order to highlight the protagonist in his state of observance and ultimately activity.
My enjoyment consists of the fact that I like tragic tales that are somewhat psychological when suffering and death are involved, however there are certain moments where those two elements of existence are not involved and the focus lies on nurturing the future, but that is my personal opinion so I shall stop here.
Hopefully my words have convinced you to or not to watch this series which is well worth watching.",9
"
                I gave this anime an ""8"" simply based on it's potential. Albeit a little graphic at times, the story itself is a rather interesting one and the uniqueness of each character in backstory and abilities makes you hope that more expansion will take place. However, the story within 12 episodes is painfully uneventful at times if not repetitive and annoying as we are faced with having to watch the main character wrestle with being a human and a ghoul over and over again with no real progress being made - until the end.
Speaking of the end - there really isn't one. Everything is left up
                  in the air.",8
"
                I am reviewing TG as a viewer who watched the anime before reading the manga.
I feel TG gets too much criticism especially from manga readers. There are some complaints that I would like to address.
1. They left out a lot of stuff from the manga.
This is partly true especially in the last arc but other than that, things that were left out were mostly nerdy trivia unimportant to the development of the story (explanation of ghoul kagune types, Hide and Kaneki's bromance dinner date, etc). 
The only real problem here is the crack-induced pacing of the anime's last arc where a dozen characters were introduced
                  in about 10 minutes and a few important scenes were cut out. This was quite disappointing since I felt the pacing and execution in the first 3-4 episodes were almost flawless. The drop in quality was likely a result of the 12 ep limit, so this is forgivable.
2. Censorship
The censors were quite atrocious as it is overused and detracts from the horror experience. Maybe it was done to reach a wider audience, but it's silly how half of the screen often gets blacked out or everything just turns blue. I don't know who is responsible for this, but I will nomnom their flesh. 
3. The MC is a wuss.
Seriously? If you want a protagonist who wtflolpwnzallggnore, go watch SAO. I'm sure you would like that kind of story ""development"". The point is Ken is a believable character who is just trying to survive. He might have a whiny voice and get kicked around for much of the series, but he does what he has to and grows stronger little by little. Watching his growth from squeaky anorexic wimp to I-will-eat-your-face beast in the face of dangerous situations is what made the show for me.
4. Underdeveloped characters.
This is also true for some especially the supporting characters. Killing off side characters, some of which had 2-3 lines (and one whose face wasn't even shown (like wtf?)) and expecting to make it into a tragic story development had me rolling my eyes. These dead characters might as well be cattle.
- Hey I'm gonna kill you dead and leave your family and loved ones forever in despair! Got any last words??
- MOOOOOOOOO!
So overall, TG was very enjoyable despite some of its legitimate flaws. It's the series I looked forward to every week, and I will be looking forward to it in S2.",9

                So have you ever had tried something and thought oh man this is going to be the most amazing thing ever but turns out you get less then what you were expecting? Your not exactly disappointed but your just there thinking of how much potential it has? Welcome to the Tokyo Ghoul!
This anime just likes to play with your feelings in the sense of having such a great potential but not reaching it. The story might be all over the place and quick but there is something there! The whole concept is kind of cool. The story is based in Tokyo where everywhere in the
                  city there are creatures called ghouls who survive off eating the human flesh because they don't eat regular food. That is the simple story of the whole show. This is where its downfall is. I feel that it could of gone so much beyond the story they went with. So that is where I will began.
The first problem is the fact how simple and quick everything escalates and relaxes during the show. Like there should be a little more time taken on developing the story, obviously maybe the studio only wanted to keep it at 12 episodes but I can imagine a 30 episode version of Tokyo Ghoul were you will get to understand the story at a better pace instead of jumping from one event to another in one episode to another. The extra details you see in other anime's would of gone really far with Tokyo Ghoul.
My second problem was there was no emotional connection with the characters. I don't know about you but the shows were you feel something with the main characters can make something good to amazing. Like when something happens like they lose a love one and you are actually choking up a bit because you are just like ""wow..."" that's when you know you have a connection with the characters. For me there were only 3 moments within the 12 episodes that actually had me feeling something in my stomach, and those scenes were so deep it actually annoyed me! Why couldn't there be more moments like this throughout the show!
My last problem was I wish there was a little more story and development with certain characters. The only characters you actually get to know about are Kaneki, Touka, Amon, Nishiki, and Henami . I would of loved to see more story with Rize her character seemed like such a cool character and someone you wanted to know about but she is just shrouded in mystery with no background whatsoever. I think if you watch you'll understand what I mean when I say a bigger role for her would of been awesome. Plus characters like Yomo and Yoshimura. These characters need development and it would of came a long way for the series.
The one thing about this show, even if it was exactly the best story and you don't get a connection with most of the characters, I can't help but love this show. Something keeps drawing me back to watch the next episode. Despite the 7/10 rating I gave it, it just has those 9 and 10 out of 10 moments within. This anime is differently worth the 12 episodes of your time, I can guarantee it.

                This will not be a long review. I'll make this as an short quick thought about the show, own perspective, and it premising.
 So when an a manga that is popularly of the 4th selling manga/novel series that sells billon's of copies in japan. Now there an Anime adaptation coming up in summer of 2014. Tokyo Ghoul is like read the F***ing manga first; before, watching the series, cause either you don't have to but you won't understand it at all (kinda). It a Dark Fantasy, Psychological Horror that a seinen genre for grown men's at least it mature and not immature.
Plot- 6.59/10 (It like
                  wicked city (references)! but not that great, Ghouls vs. Humans to build up society on the timeline it fine but a major characters only have the focused on lack of ability to make decision if your half human or half ghoul during the events on the plot not satisfying)
Introduction: 7/10
Conflict: 8/10
Pacing: 6.59/10
Art- 8/10 ( It really visual, great detail. The Violence censored ship is a real bitch, but luckily I've got the DVD/Blu-Ry and it awesome without that pointless neon color)
 Animation: 8/10

Sound- 8/10 ( The Op song it's beautiful. End song is descent, the soundtrack is really good, but does it really fit to the series.) 
 Music: 8/10
 Voices: 7/10

Characters 7.59/10 ( After all the main cast they well done.
 Mine is Touka, Kirishima. I'll like how she an anti-hero she my kill bad ghouls, but humans for the act greater of kind of ghoul society)
 Development: 6.59/10
Enjoyment- 9/10 ( I really! really enjoy it! From the start it very awesome, The middle of it quite fine, to the end it gone from Shockley brutal though WTF!) It not the best anime, it not the greatest, it just good 75% GOOD!",7

                Tokyo Ghoul
        Tokyo Ghoul has to be my favorite anime of the 2014 Summer anime season.
Yes, I do agree with most people this anime was rushed and could have been so much better, but the way its heading I think Tokyo Ghoul season 2 is going to be great.
        I loved this anime because well, I'm up to date with the manga and the first two arcs were flipped (Doves Arc and Gourmet Arc) and the Mother & Daughter Arc was not the best, but the Aogiri Arc was done really
                  well. I also personally love the characters of this story and the universe it takes place in. Although the censors hit pretty hard in this anime, but it wasn't to overkill because in the manga it's pretty graphic.
SUMMARY:
        Tokyo Ghoul is a great series and should probably be watched by any anime fan who like horror / thriller anime. Besides the rushing and censoring this anime has exceeded my expectations for it. 
9/10",9

                If you like gore and violence, you'll like Tokyo Ghoul. If you like vampires (more on the violent side than the dramatic side, but still pretty), you'll like Tokyo Ghoul. If you like zombies, you'll like Tokyo Ghoul. In my personal opinion, ""ghouls"" in this anime are a mix of the two, which surprisingly, turned out to be a cool and unique concept.  
Story: I started watching the anime two days ago, and I finished it today. Going into it, I didn't know much aside that it may be ""zombie-like"" and that it is a very popular anime of this season. The story and
                  plot are fast-paced, and there is consistent action throughout each and every episode. As most of the supernatural concepts used in the anime are not something completely new and original, I'm giving the story an 8, but that doesn't mean the show itself isn't great, because, it is for what it is- violent and fun.
Art: The art in this anime is an 8. It's ""up to date"" and doesn't look like it was made more than 5 years ago, but the character designs are overall fairly simple in my opinion. This however, is not necessarily a bad thing, because it makes all the interesting supernatural elements stand out more. :) The main character is likable because he is so dull and ordinary when starting out, but then, well, exciting plot happens~ Anyway, despite not being the most amazing art out there, it definitely has its moments especially in the fight scenes.
Sound: I was thinking around a 7.5, so I gave it an 8. The sound is good, and the op and ed are pretty good. but nothing outstanding really popped out at me. All the appropriate action scene music sequences are there when they are supposed to be, though. Overall very good sound no major complaints, but again, nothing amazing, either.
Character: The characters are what I really like about this anime.  Despite there only being 12 episodes, I feel there was a lot of character development. :) There are also a lot of characters, so I would say it was probably quite difficult to have that without making the anime seem like, ""Oh this ep was all character development and no action."" It never felt like that; there was always a good mix of the two.  
Overall, I really enjoyed this anime and would recommend it to supernatural and action anime fans.  There are also some funny moments and plenty of dark humor if you're into that as well.",9
"
                Imagine a world where the very people you walk along with, chat with, spend so much time with wasn't exactly who they truly are. What if you were prey to the very individual you call 'friend.'
This is the setting of Tokyo Ghoul; on planet Earth exists subspecies to humans known as ghouls who can only hunt and prey on the flesh of human. Set in tokyo's 20th ward, Nerima, Ken Kaneki, a mere average individual, has his life changed exponentially. What first began as a dream date with the girl he admired turned into something beyond he could believe would happen.
As a huge fan of
                  the manga, I was slightly disappointed in the potential that was lost in this anime. Of course the limit of 12 episodes guarantees that not all content would be implemented, but factors such as Kaneki's extreme training underground and the reason he doesn't see others in his family. If one hasn't started either, I recommend the anime first then the manga so no disappointment is had.",8
"
                This is my first time writing a review on MyAnimeList. Helpful/Not Helpful votes are appreciated and comments about my reviewing, writing, and quality are appreciated.
When I don't call a character by their full name, I use whatever name the other characters use.
As many of you may know, Tokyo Ghoul is an adaptation of a wildly popular recent manga. I have personally read the manga, but I will not reference it at all since manga and their anime adaptations should be standalone works of art and should thus be judged separately.
Tokyo Ghoul was a great premise with lots of little holes strewn throughout the entire show.
                  It has great insights into the nature of monsters, and the grey morality vs. ethics debate going on throughout the show is very well thought out. Where this show is lacking is little details all over, such as Kaneki's random ability to knock out an intimidating thug, or even more so his sudden bursts of fighting ability even though the anime never showed much of him training. Issues like these slowed down the show but did not take away enough for me to give it a terrible review. 
Story- 6/10
The premise and world of Tokyo Ghoul is brilliant. Man-eating creatures known as ghouls exist and interlope in human society, constantly murdering humans for a food source since ghouls can only receive nutrients by digesting human flesh. Our hero, Ken Kaneki, gets thrown into the chaos of being a ghoul while still keeping his connections to the human world. What would happen if the only way a human could survive with his new body is to eat other humans? The show tries to answer this question and does a solid job of showing Kaneki's despair. The first few episodes were extremely strong and were arguably the strongest episodes save for the finale. After that, the show takes a nosedive. The Gourmet arc was disappointing. It simply became a battler against the evil guy with none of the provocative morality issues that the show lives and dies by. However, after that the show manages to pick up and until the very end it does well in keeping its original premise and moral dilemmas.
The major issue with the story is that the pacing is horrendous. Plot points seem to be missing, things happen for no apparent reason, and the setting skips all over the place. The show fails to give a sense of time so the viewer is led to assume that all of these terrible things that happen to Kaneki are chronologically very close. On top of this, the show has episodes were a lot happens, episodes where very little happens, and episodes that are too inconsistent. While squeezing this complex story into a 1-cour season may have been tough, it would have been better to make a slower, better prepared 2-cour show that in turn adapted more of the source material. 
Characters- 6/10
In a show with grey morality and grimdark happenings in the plot, the characters and the way the characters are shaped should star as conflicted individuals who are hard-pressed between the lesser of two evils. This is not the case.
Our hero, Ken Kaneki, is a little bitch. While this may help advance the plot and enforce the themes of morality vs. ethics, it does nothing for the enjoyment of the anime. The way to get around this is to give our little bitch some fantastic character development throughout the course of the story, where he slowly hardens as more and more crap is thrown at him. What actually happens in the story is that he has almost no character development throughout the story and then suddenly his entire personality changes. This is not the proper way to develop a character.
The best written character and character development comes from the main heroine Touka Kirishima. As a powerful former rogue ghoul who joined the coffee shop and secret ghoul society Anteiku, her extreme bluntness was entertaining when she got lumped together with the clueless and helpless Kaneki. Touka gets proper development. Events change her more subtly. Her personality does not really change even though some events shake her considerably. Compared to Kaneki, Touka is a well written character who personifies the ghoul side of the morality debate. 
The other notable character is Kotarou Amon, but he does not get as much screen time as I felt he should. As the human protagonist and the human anchor for the morality debate, seeing more of him and more of his thoughts on ghouls would have been ideal.
Some of the other side characters, such as the manager Yoshimura and the young girl Hinami, are great supporting characters. Others, like the ghoul hunter Mado and the eccentric ghoul Tsukiyama, are much more linear. Because of Kaneki's bad characterization and some weak supporting characters, I gave the show a score of 6/10 for characters.
Art- 6/10
The animation and character design for the show is very good, with each character being instantly recognizable. Action scenes are well done, and the animation of the special ghoul kagunes is very pretty to look at. The major flaw with the animation is that every time some grimdark mutilation of the body occurs, a giant black area appears on the screen and obscures whatever happened in the anime. It's impossible to tell what happened to certain characters because of this and completely takes away from the experience. The angles scenes are shown from however are very well chosen to portray the mood and atmosphere of events.
Sound- 7/10
I really liked the opening of the show at first, but as time went on, the overly high pitched vocals started to get on my nerves. The lyrics of the song tie in very well to the show itself.
The voice acting is done by a great cast. All of the characters sounded alive and the emotion in their voices (or gruesome screams) was done well. Mamoru Miyano was spectacular as usual, but it was a damn shame he got placed on an unremarkable supporting character.
The BGM for the show never caught my attention. It certainly didn't take away from the experience, but it was nothing to write home about.
Enjoyment- 7/10
The main ""thing"" this show offers is its extremely well defined look into morality. Is it ok for ghouls to eat humans to survive? Are there ways around this? Should any ghoul be killed on sight? This show, despite its huge flaws all over the place, made me think. It made me think a lot about how I condemn certain people for doing certain things. Despite how great this is, many aspects take away from the show. Kaneki is pathetically weak despite his potential strength. The random censoring of gore is extremely annoying. The plot is full of holes and is inconsistent. I can go on and on nitpicking little things, but my stance on the broad aspects of the show is very positive.
Overall- 6/10
Tokyo Ghoul failed to accomplish what it set out to do as an anime. Despite this, it was fun to watch and as a weekly show it certainly did not waste my time.
If your question while reading my review is ""Should I watch this show?"", my answer is yes. However, do not go in with high expectations, and if you want a better representation of what this story and world stands for, you should go read the manga.",6
"
                Did not care for this one at all. The philosophy of the main character is stupid. This show just acts like it is so much deeper than it is. This show is NOT a deep show with complex themes like Death Parade. What this show is is a confusing world that took me like 5 times to watch it to get a semblance of what the the hell was going on. Making confusing relationships doesn't make a show deep or complex. It makes a show confusing. 
Now some may wonder why I brought up Death Parade. Well I gave that show a 10. That show
                  acts as a guide for what I expect, quality wise, from animes when they deal with complex moral issues and themes. And TG just doesn't hold up. It's confusing, arrogant in thinking it's better than what it is, and really boring. I only finished it because all 12 episodes were out. 
*This is a message for those of you who liked the show.*
I'm glad that you liked this show. I am happy that someone, somewhere got some enjoyment from it. I'm just expressing my opinion on it. Please don't get mad at me for disliking it.",3
"
                This is my first anime review so please forgive my grammatical and technical mistakes. Although I like ""survival"" but this anime does not seem to be getting the point.This anime is a little too much overrated and makes me wonder what the hell had happened to our taste of enjoyment. I wish anime were written a little smarter. Character development is very bad and too generic actually make me less interested also because of how unrealistic the characters behave. There are no redeeming characters in this show, they might as well all be 2nd graders given their intellectual acumen. The season one is just too
                  slow paced and kind of boring because I just couldn't figure out the direction of the plot and the main point to the whole story. What happens to the main character just is enough to drive the plot forward in my mind.
Story 6/10: (Spoiler alert!)
The story was pretty good and random with ghouls here and there. It did not had anything special in the story. The story was neither emotional nor cheerful. It felt like they tried to put a thick layer of emotional cheese in this creepy pizza but it turns out that it turns out they forgot to put anything else. Seriously how are they supposed to make it emotional without any character development and with the boy crying and the strong protective girl. The starting was good but hey, look at the ending, there comes a war and the main character gets some potential and kills the villain it was just boring. And everything was pretty dumb. The plot seemed king of low, half of the episodes were held in a hotel. I was expecting they should at least take it to a wide area .
Characters 4/10:(Spoiler alert!)
Yet another coming of age type show with a dark hero. I really hate these weakling heroes turned superman on a whim type shows but it is what it is. Kaneki also is too pessimist for a main role, he should be happy about fitting in both worlds. Oh look there its happening, First Tsukiyama Shuu  tries then tries to save Kaneki and then Nishiki Nishio who first tried to kill him is also supporting him, also Rize Kamishiro who first turned Kaneki into ghoul and then saves him from turning dead by teaching  a heartless lesson, are we supposed to be with them or against them. And I already had mentioned , there is not a little character development... all of them should die. Also when there is no character to take sides with, why should we even care about who the hell dies. And Hideyoshi Nagachika, Kaneki's  best friend for just four episodes, seriously, is he even a friend of Kaneki. And also I thought mask were to represent their personality so why did such a bold girl like Touka Kirishima gets to be a little cute bunny. But the characters were also eye-catching with different styles and I really like that the characters are perfectly drawn.
Art 10/10:(Spoiler alert!)
The art was the best thing in the whole series, everything was perfect except the low plot and  those shapeless and colorless, odorless ghoul weapons. 
Sound 9/10:(Spoiler alert!)
The sound was also good, doesn't sucks so bad and the best thing is that it has a dubbed version. Also I only know about the dubbed version. The starting and ending song was also good.
Enjoyment 3/10:(Spoiler alert!)
It was kind of a sick entertainment only for sadists. How could we even enjoy this thing with not even a single joke to cheer up, why someone would even watch such a creepy movie with an ending which ended only by changing some mind set. I watched this anime because my friend told me that this anime comes in watch before you die and that you will love it. But when I was watching this thing, I thought that I am watching the  wrong anime or the did I skipped some episodes as there was nothing good in this anime that it claims to be.
Overall 6/10:(Spoiler alert!)
This anime has noting to go on with, this story could just had ended in 2 episodes... Kaneki becomes a ghoul and then tries not to eat anyone ..but wait, how is he still alive?. ..At the end he ate the bad guy , fought with him and defeated him, the end. There is nothing to it. This anime does not contain any romance ,funny scenes, mystery etc. This story also seems to be following ,first fight then talk policy. although there are some catchy seems which you usually don't get to see in many anime, like a little girl eating human flesh and a ghoul who is getting tortured by humans. The anime was neither interesting nor disgusting ,it lies somewhere in between. Although the story ids totally different from what it seems to be in the cover.",6

                Tokyo Ghoul is this season's guilty pleasure anime. I remember when I saw the first episode; ""This is going to be a lot of fun"" and it did, in some ways. I am torn in to give it a rating, it definitely deserves more than 7 but it has too many flaws to be an 8. If I could use a decimal place it'd definitely be a 7.8 
-Minor Spoiler Alert-  
Tokyo Ghoul focuses on the Kaneki Ken a human who is artificially made into a ghoul, a humanoid who devours on humans. Unlike it's manga counterpart which is more like an ensemble of
                  different characters focused equally. Anime follows a different perspective, it revolves mainly around the struggles of Kaneki Ken rather than involving much of the awesome side characters. 
Before I go on to justify my opinion, I want to make a note on how beautiful the series's soundtrack is. The theme, the in-anime music, the ending song they all blend well with the series. Another great thing about the anime is it's art, though not extraordinary, it is beautifully drawn. Ironically anime's major disappointment also comes from the art, it is heavily censored that just kills the mood. 
As I have said before, Tokyo Ghoul anime unlike manga follows a fast pace; It might be a good thing for some but some bad decisions follows. Anime skips a lot of character development such as Rize's back story and all together never goes in to explain much about wards or other exclusive words which are extensively used. 
Now to the part where I want to justify all the anime/manga differences: 
In my opinion hate surrounding the anime is unjustified and vague, if you have read the manga you will know that even though anime is skimmed of much of its glory from its parent material; this was the only way to make a great story like Tokyo Ghoul feel good to general anime viewers who are not patient enough for slow plot development. For example, refer to the Chapter 61 of manga, which is the part where Kaneki gets tortured, read it a bit you will find how not only different the manga is not just in the feel but also the story and narration. One other instance would be when Touka gets called 'beautiful' the emotions delivered in the anime though subtle are effective unlike the manga which feels rather dull on that department. Kaneki's battle with Yamori, I still can't believe how fantastically they pulled it out unlike manga which felt a bit dry and not 'epic' at all.    
Nonetheless, read the manga or the anime. Tokyo Ghoul is bound to hold you tight no doubts. 
-RECOMMENDED : GORE, SUPER HUMANS, GHOULS- 
Pros: 
 + Absorbing plot
 + War like theme
 + Great soundtrack
 + Enthralling development of Main Character 
 + Great battles
Cons: 
 - Censors 
 - Minimal side character development 
 - Huge deviation from Manga (Subjective con)",7

                So this is my first review since joining MAL, so you can tell i enjoyed this.
First however, note that i am reviewing TG as a standalone anime as i have not read the manga.
Ive seen a lot of reviews on this and i felt they were unjust, criticising TG for being too short, and being forced into 12 ep's. I don't want this to deter people from watching this however, because as an anime its one of the top 5 this season.
Story:9
Tokyo Ghoul is one of the more darker anime's this season. Combing both elements of horror and gore and mixing them into a psychological,
                  supernatural drama, TG is an anime that stood out among others this season. It darker atonement worked perfectly and the story could flourish. Starting smooth ad finishing with a epic climax, the story was spectacular.
Art:8
Visually, TG was stunning. While maintaining the standard of art we would all expect in 2014, TG's art was up to scratch. It holds itself visually as a dark anime, and the only reason its not a 10 is that, it was the standard, if it pushed this it would be the 10.
Sound:9
The EP had viewers nostalgic before the show had even started and the OP gave them that moment to reflect on what they had seen, the sound of TG again was up to the standard we all want to see. The voices matched well and the shouts and grunts of pain really portrayed the characters emotions and feelings, creating a very strong drama feel.
Character: 8
There is a broad range of characters, from the humble Kaneki, to the fiery Touka, to the sadistic Jason, many characters make the show their own in this show. The vast range of personalities allows you to fell their struggle but also helps portray the view that ghouls are ""human"" too, they show the same feelings. The main character is displayed as this hopeless boy who doesn't know who he is, but we see a huge development. The supporting characters also shape this anime well, creating many who will be remembered, whether you hate or love them.
Enjoyment: 10
As i said, i have not read the manga so i am reviewing this purely as an anime, rather than a adaptation, and as an adaptation, it was superb, a masterpiece of this season. The tension and suspense was real, and the i thoroughly enjoyed it. For only being 12 episodes it managed to capture my full attention, and since its only 12 episodes as it stands, i would highly recommend everyone sees this.
Overall: 9
Overall i give TG a 9 out of 10 rating, TG was an eye catcher this season and held me with suspense for 12 weeks straight. It's everything i look for in an anime in that genre and i was definitely not disappointed. If some scenes had been fleshed out a bit more, giving more time to other support characters, and had the MC not seemed so helpless for long, this would have  been a guaranteed No 1 this season",9

                SPOILERS ALERT:
Ah, the summer of 2014. The spawn of several great, mediocre and well, underachieving anime. And Tokyo Ghoul is no exception.
Story: 7
Tokyo Ghoul overall, has a pretty good story. It's quite original, although the sight of eating devouring people is quite old. The story does eventually get its points, etc. The story in ITSELF isn't cringe-worthy, and I enjoyed the concept of living in a society with creatures disguised as humans devouring the very species we are. The only exception I have is that do the ghouls only live in Japan? I mean, why does every single thing happen in Japan? What about the
                  rest of the world? Don't they not react to this type of situation when they KNOW there are intelligent creatures out there, eating people. Shouldn't they research them instead of killing them with suitcases disguised as weapons? Besides that, good story.
Art: 9
The art in itself is very nice. Studio Pierrot is an experienced animation studio, having created the works of Naruto and Bleach. And overall, I had high expectations for the animation and it didn't fail to deliver.
Sound: 7
The soundtrack for Tokyo Ghoul wasn't anything special. There was no OST that really stood out for me, and the opening and ending songs wasn't something I entirely enjoyed. I had high expectations for the OP song when I heard the band that sang the Psycho-Pass OP song was going to this one, but unfortunately, it didn't really catch my attention.
Character: 4
Ooooh boy, where do I begin? This is, simply point out, the WORST aspect of this entire scrap-pile of an anime. Ken Kaneki, your average pussy-boy for the 12 episodes. I have read the manga and I know he starts out as a wimp, but I had REALLY hoped that they would get Kaneki to shapen up by like.. The 8th episode. That didn't happen. What even DISAPPOINTED ME FURTHER was that the anime was only 12 fucking episodes long. I mean, the manga ended a few days ago, so you could do us all a favor and make another 12 episodes. But no, on the last episode you have Kaneki turn from a big wimp to some apparent badass who could beat the shit out of Jason because of some extensive torture (math). I mean speaking realistically, I think I'd just cry even more. But I don't know, shit happens. Touka Kirishima is just one of those stereotypical female leads that just loves to use her fists instead of her head. And whatever happened to that guy who loves to sniff Kaneki's fucking bloody hanky? Oh, he tries to kill Kaneki once but now he's apparently working with him in order to secretly devour him one day. In a nutshell, the characters suck.
Enjoyment: 6
I personally didn't enjoy this anime too much. I had high expectations for this anime, I really did. I was really excited when it came out, but it more or less a roller-coaster ride that only slowly went downhill from the first to last episode. Maybe you'll have a better time watching it than me, but I personally didn't find it TOO great
Overall: 7
Even with all the flack and criticism I've been giving this anime, it's one of the ones that in itself stood out and was one of the better ones of the Summer 2014 anime roster list. I can name a bunch of anime much, much better than this, but in itself, it wasn't too bad. I might have rated it higher if it was 24-25 episodes, but season 2 hasn't been confirmed yet, so I can't for sure right now. If you like colors (specifically red and black), watch this anime.",7
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is a very hard title for me to rate. At some moments I was just dying to see what would come next, while a certain story arc in particular just felt silly and uneeded. I would say it's strong suit is it's phenomonal animation and choreography which was paced well with fitting sound effects and music. However, the story's plot could be very convoluted at times, and although it has some admirable characters, the main character himself, Ken Kaneki, fell short of my expectations.
As for the story, the overall concept seems to be innovative, however it doesn't seem to know what it wants
                  to be. At first, it seemed to be centered all arounf Kaneki, and him learning how to deal with his recent predicament of becoming a ghoul. They showed Kaneki's psychological melt down wonderfully, and it seemed to be about Kaneki struggling to figure out how to become a ghoul. The psychological story about Kaneki's internal battles and his decisions to either somehow overcome his insatiable hunger for human flesh, or succumb to his carnal desires.
However, this character has little to no character development whatsoever. He is taken in and babied by the workers at Anteiku, and everything he knows is taught to him, not having to figure out things out by himself. Even when he is told what he has to do in order to save the ones he cares about, he still comes off as a p*ssy. Although I did not like Kaneki, I did however love Touka's character. She was rational, yet hot headed, and wasn't afraid to be blunt. Also, I admired how they went over Nishio's back story, and why he is the way he is, although I wished they elaborated just a bit more on it. 
Everyone who has seen Tokyo Ghoul knows it mainly for its phenomanal opening. I actually didn't like the opening song that much, and found it to be quite average. However, I came to love it, along with it's abstract imagery. The opening song, Unravel, also plays during the finally which brings back a feeling of nostaligia and really ties it all together. Not only was the opening great, the background music and voice actors (Japanese) fit the scene and the characters. 
Speaking of music and sound effects, they blend perfectly with the different atmospheres and fight scenes. The uncensored fight choreography was great, although it tended to go overboard and turn into a pointless gorefest. However, I found it to be tasteful at most times, and since it has such dark themes, explicit violence is to be expected. I absolutely adored the character designs of this anime. Each was unique, and tended to reflect on their personality. Although some may think they go over the top with these designs, I find them to fit in with the world they are placed in.
My overall enjoyment of the series is a fairly high rank. Although it had it's flaws and downfalls, I still find it to be a good commentary on topics like discrimination and humanity, especially in the last couple of episodes. It constantly questions you who the true villians are, ghouls or humans?",7
"
                At first this anime didn't strike me as interesting, but when I actually sat down and watched it, it instantly became a personal favorite for me. The main character at the start of the anime is a bit hard to like at first, but in the second season it focuses on him being able to hold his own, instead of hiding behind everyone else. The progression at the start of the anime is a bit fast, but easy to understand. Also the manga to this anime, is a bit more detailed and just as enjoyable, so check that out.
I gave this anime a 10/10 for
                  these reasons. The story kept me entertained throughout the entire anime. The soundtrack went well with the anime and the opening is one of my favorites, the opening in the second season sucked though. The art is really good, but I would say the story line is one of its strongest selling points. Most of the characters were interesting to learn about. If I had to compare this anime to another then it would probably be Parasyte. Both are similar anime styles and focus on a character turning into a supernatural being. 
Some of the negatives of this anime. I think the anime didn't go into enough detail as much as the manga did and skipped out on some important points that the manga focused on. The only other thing would be the main character at the beginning of the series, but nothing else really bothered me about this anime.
Definitely an anime I highly recommend!!! Give it a shot at least through the first episode!",10
"
                Tokyo Ghoul,  a popular fan favorite of 2014. The first 11 episodes of the anime isn't what I had hoped for. Kaneki, the protagonist of the show was pretty much a fragile character with no real combat skills getting his ass handed too or crying every other episode. I know it was all for the build up for the final episode where he finally snaps, but it shouldn't take that long, its very time consuming. But dont get me wrong, the12th episode was epic, I am stoked and expect great things from the second half of the season. More fights, more gore, and more
                  feels, things such as that. I like the idea of the storyline as well as the artwork, im sure the manga is pretty epic and more in-depth than how the anime has been but still definitely worth the watch!",7
"
                Its a anime where patience is required a little. The story's beginning is a little slow and may take upto 3 to 4 episodes to build up audience interest and engagement. However the anime introduces many interesting concepts and therefore is very entertaining to watch. The battle of Kaneki (main character) with the world and with himself and his ""condition"" brings a contrast to the reality v/s ideal concept which is its more interesting to watch. Nevertheless, the beginning would seem to be slow but after a few episodes it gets better and is worth a shot.

                Tokyo Ghoul, a series I’ve heard about over and over that I finally had to check it out, and am so glad I did. The first two episodes are a blast to watch, let alone the entire series. While I did experience joy and excitement while watching, there was an equal amount of fear and concern. This is a good thing though, since it means you’re invested. I only wish I had more than twelve episodes to get the entire picture...good thing there's a season two, three, and four right? To me, zombies, or ghouls, seem like an overplayed concept. Man eating monsters, there’s thousands
                  of titles similar. But TG stands apart not just because of its premise but how they introduce everything. The beginning had me feeling emotions of joy and intrigue, then suddenly switching to sympathy and despair. You can’t help but feel for the main character Kaneki in every way. Though he approaches everything differently than I would, I still find myself sympathetic of his logic. The characters are introduced well, story is present from the start, the art design is raw (but beautiful), and the premise is alluring in its own way.
The main “protagonist” Kaneki, starts out kinda lame, but he has an appeal that makes you keep hitting next episode. If there was a blueprint for an almost perfect character arc, it would be his. His drive is a mystery, his interests stay the same, he’s not strong, doesn’t appear to have any potential to greatness, and isn’t anything special from the start. That being said, I’ve truly come to love his story, and want so badly for him to experience the life he so desperately wants for himself. While on the topic of characters, Touka, the blue haired mystery woman is just incredible. I can easily say she’s my favorite, and her story is nothing short of incredible. Continuing through the series, I hope she grows while maintaining her original allure. Lastly, the antagonists or “the villains” are presented so well, that any opinion you may have of one of them can be obfuscated in an instant. Yes there are the irredeemable, but this show does a good job of promoting forgiveness. I credit this to Kanike’s actions and how we the audience perceive them, thus taking a look inward and defining what we find as acceptable or good.
Kanike’s experiences from the start are both fascinating and jarring. His relationship with his best friend is something to behold. I have friends but I doubt any of them would show as much dedication to my happiness as his best friend. His first and technically only encounter with the, arguable, main antagonist of the series, Rize, is simultaneously beautiful, intriguing, sexy, and horrifying. It sounds strange to combine those descriptions for Rize, but it’s truly a masterpiece how the creator portrays her. Her role in the show is worth the watch by itself. I am so happy with how the pilot episode went down, it really drew me in. And the story only gets more interesting as it goes on. The world can feel dull, dark, and lonesome, like real life, but it can also be beautiful, exciting, and fun!
As for the art of the show, one episode in particular stands out to me. I won’t spoil the events but one encounter between two girls at a church was so impactful and I couldn’t help but feel a sense of wonder for the direction and design the team chose to take. The abilities of some ghouls is also something that never gets old seeing. And as for locations, Tokyo always looks great, but this version was done so well, it makes me want to visit one day. Lastly, the voice acting is top notch, these voice actors really know how to sell their roles (I look forward to seeing more of their work.
This is a once in a lifetime story that I am humbled to have been able to experience, and am relieved I decided to give it a shot. If you have any interest at all, bite the bullet and give it a chance, you most likely will get at least a little something out of it. Though it’s not the greatest anime in history, and is not quite a perfect 10 for me, it easily could be for many other viewers. After finishing the season, I can safely say it’s a hell of a ride.",9
"
                Tokyo Ghoul for the most part is a very dark and entertaining anime.
The story does have a leave a few questions about why the main character is a ghoul. The show hints at there being a bigger reason for Kaneki becoming a ghoul which will be interesting to see. The story takes an interesting turn in the last episode so watch to the end. 
The Art is very well done and makes for great action scenes.
Sounds is good and a pretty decent intro.
The characters for the most part seem like typical anime characters. And there doesn't seem to be much of anything special about most
                  of them but the show does do a good job of making hate one of the detectives.
Overall very enjoyable and definitely worth the watch.",8
"
                So this anime is getting so much hate lately.Let me say some things bout this anime.
Pros:
1)Awesome soundtrack:
Clearly one of the best anime soundtracks that ever existed. They have chosen the best soundtracks to fit situations like death, win etc.
2)Story:
Really good plot and really good story.Even at the first episode it gets you interested.It keeps you on the edge of your seat.
3)Art:
Really good art, although there are some mistakes(Well, nobody is perect)
Cons:1)Character:
Although at the first episodes of season 1, Kaneki seemed to have personality, moving to season 2 whe see him so different.No personality, just doesn't fucking care about anything and doesn't give a fuck. Well, I don't say that I wanted him to be a crybaby like the first episodes, but not such an asshole.",9
"
                Story: 7/10
Tokyo goul has a good plot, the scenario is well done because its an unusual situation.
The character is not ""totally"" a monster or an human.
That means that he's evolving in 2 environnement, who make the story interesting
Art: 9/10
Nothing to say, very good graphisms, excellent design.
Smooth.
Sound: 8/10
Very nice openings/endings.
The ost is per-fect, the songs are just amazing and immersive.
Character: 4/10
I just hate the main character, he's too f*cking WEAK.
This guy is doing nothing, just watching and suffering himself.
You have to wait the last episode to see a evolution of the character.
Btw the other characters are quite good, in particular Toka, who's in my opinion, the most developped character of the anime.
Overall : 7/10",7
"
                I am here to say this now, this will be terrible. I hope no one finds this informative, you have much better time to read a better review.
Story: 6, Its decent enough. You have Kankei who with the likes of some may not like, but I truly enjoyed him. To be quite honest him and the guy with the tissue problem... were y favorite characters. I may have spoiled something in there, forgive me if I had.
OST: 7, I rate that high as Unravel was amazing to me. I'll base this on me not even seeing enough anime to know a good soundtrack when there
                  is one. The music that plays through the anime is good.
Art: 8, I rate this so high as again, haven't seen enough anime to know, but the blood when someone is either eaten or killed just mystifies me.
Overall: 7, It is't bad, but since I can't read manga (physically impossible for me, trust me) I cannot judge how much better the manga is than the anime so the overall score is based on that.",7
"
                I was introduced to this anime at AX this year in Los Angeles when me and a couple buddies went to the panel. I wasn't really interested in it because I thought it was just one of those anime where they only have one season and it's done. I watched the first episode at the panel and I was hooked already. Here is what I liked: It had an awesome story line with characters I felt emotionally attached to and most relatable. I also enjoyed how the characters change and mature throughout the story realizing both ghouls and humans are wrong and Kaneki is the
                  only one who can reason with both. I disliked how it was one of those animes where it's really good but it's only 12 episodes. This anime really had me anticipated for the next episode every Thursday. Can't wait for Season 2.",8
"
                Now, I give Tokyo Ghoul an 8, yet it is a very weak 8 due to some glaring issues with pacing and the characters. Now, let me start off by saying that I have not read the manga and I did enjoy the show to a degree.  
Let's start with the good of the show. Aside from censorship, the art is very nice with interesting visuals and decent animation. I have no complaints about the music, not my favorite, but not bad. The story is pretty engaging and keeps you interested. 
Now, onto the bad and why I consider the show a weak 8
                  at best. The pacing in this show is really bad. some things you just have to accept that they happened without them actually being shown, like Kaneki's fighting training. I believe that they show him training once, during which he doesn't exactly do well, and then later, he remarks how his fighting training has really helped. So you just assume that he has been training, without actually seeing it. Since everything happens pretty quickly, you never really gain any attachment to the vast majority of the characters. Most of which get very little backstory, if any, and are easy to forget. Finally the ending is basically saying ""now wait for season two"", The main fight in the end takes only a few minutes, due to some pacing issues in the last episode, but this time, they drew everything out in the last episode and leave no time for conclusion and rush the moment you were waiting for.  
If the show was, say, 24 episodes, they could have avoided these issues and  my grade and overall feel on the show would be better. Take the issues with a grain of salt and enjoy what's there, which kept my grade at an 8, although a very weak one at that. Just have to sit back and wait for a second season for (hopefully) a conclusion.",8
"
                Tokyo Ghoul seems to divide people into two groups. One of them saying ""season one was ok, but the second season was so bad"" and then the other group ""hey, I'm quite a fan of that, both were pretty cool"".
I guess that both groups have their own rights, and I do respect both sides. Although in this review, I'm going to talk about this series from the side I've chosen. Let me say that loud and clear. I'm quite a fan of that, I think it's a good series with a magnificent plot, a marvelous problem which I would discuss with my friends, and think
                  about even now, not knowing what is the answer.
You might be curious what that discussion might be about.
And well, it's essentially about choosing one side, because you cannot solve this problem by a consensus. 
And yes that is the problem, being able to surrender on something, being able to survive, being able to live.
After watching this you might ask yourself, whether what you saw is fair or not.
You might ask yourself if what happened is humanly right.
You might ask yourself, what you would do, what would your behavior be like.
Test yourself, ask yourself. What do you feel.
SCORES:
STORYLINE:
It is very good. Nicely written.
Here we find ourselves in Tokyo. Modern Tokyo to be exact. Humanity faces a problem, that problem is called ghouls. These although, having the looks of a human, are actually predators to humans. They would attack people to devour them afterwards, that's how they eat, that's how they live, and that's the only way they can survive.
You would think. ""Hey that is really bad, they all should just die! They kill people, and then eat them!""
But the question that will be asked is.
What are ghouls supposed to do?
VIBE:
Essentially it's a horror anime, but you do know that it is not scary, there's not a lot of anime horrors that would scare you. It's more of a psychological freakout than anything else.
But that is good, it's better than a simple spook, because it makes you think about stuff.
Of course, there is gore everywhere, you can imagine that just from the idea of somebody eating someone. But it's quality gore, they won't exaggerate with blood and body parts flying around, it's simply quality.
I do like it's vibe, it's just making you uneasy, because you experience things from opposite points of view, and from that you get doubts. You start thinking, it makes you uneasy, you see that they are at unease too. It's good, it will keep you going through the whole thing.
It also changes, the vibe changes. I cannot judge if it changes for the better, but it is simply different, I could say, more uneasy.
ART STYLE:
Damn it's pretty, it's damn pretty. You can obviously see that they wanted to make it old-school style, especially the investigators, big guys, big muscles, small heads, small eyes. It works well for the vibe.
Animation quality is awesome, especially in fights, you could imagine that from the people that made Bleach and Naruto, they surely know what they are doing. 
There's is nothing in the art style that would make you mad, or unsatisfied. I like the looks of it, it's quality drawing.
MUSIC/VOICEACTING:
I've been listening to opening from that anime for a couple of weeks now, and I can't get enough of it. Acoustic version of it, is even better.
I simply love this soundtrack. Just because you can hear lots of violin there, that is what I simply love. If I could marry violin, I would do it!
CONCLUSION:
I simply think that this is a anime without mistakes. They didn't make any mistakes, at least I couldn't find them. To be honest with you, while turning on the first episode on my PC, I was very pessimistic. I knew it was very popular and often very popular animes are bad. I was surprised, and I am happy to be surprised.
I do think it's not for everybody, but it's a anime to watch. There's a lot to feel, and a lot to experience, if you are able to understand it. Some people might have problems with understanding it, or they might just simply don't like it. I heard people saying that it's ""disappointing"". 
I do not agree with them.
Video Review: https://youtu.be/IALCIk1chco",8
"
                Well, because of all the fever around it, I thought it'd be the most outstanding anime ever. It could really be, though, but many parts of the story are left behind during the way and they don't explain the reason for many things. I think if they had focused on telling what exactly is a ghoul and told the stories of the ones around kaneki better it would have become a classic anime (I hope I'll be able to find all this in TG root A). 
Despite all, it has a really good animation, really good effects and music and I needed to watch the
                  opening everytime. 
It's not thaaaaat much, but still it is very good and can keep you watching without making you bored. :)",8

                I finished watching Tokyo Ghoul a few hours ago and wrote a very enthusiastic review but it was all in caps because I wanted express my excitement as best I could. Apparently this is against the rules so I'm re-uploading with proper punctuation and grammar.
But anyway, Tokyo Ghoul was by far one of the best, if not the best, anime shows I have ever seen. I'm seriously still so overwhelmed with so many emotions I don't even have the capacity to feel, I'm not even joking. 
You, whoever you are, person reading this review, must watch this anime the moment you're done ready. Actually forget
                  about finishing the review, go watch it now. Like, right this second. 
Watch it. I promise that you will not regret it.",10
"
                So this is my first review, so keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that just because I enjoyed it, doesn't mean that it was perfect. 
What first caught my eye in Tokyo Ghoul was the dark setting it looked to have, but ultimately the setting was more there to sugar coat the story than to actual establish a dark atmosphere. While Tokyo was displayed to have ghouls living and hiding within the city, yet the residents leave their houses at night, the time most ghouls feed, and are not even skeptical of their own neighbors. 
The ghouls seemed like the perfect monster to
                  give fear to humanity and the best enemy I would want to see humans fight against, yet we only see them as human looking monsters that wanted to live with their food in harmony. The most normal acting characters were actual some of the most dangerous ghouls the show had known.
Ignoring the censorship, the fights were well done and nicely executed. I say nicely and not perfectly simply because no matter what anime, there is always more talking than fighting.
The characters were pretty easy to read for the most part. Each one fell into a different arc-type making it easy to tell what would happen when one character interacted with another. While this isn't exactly a bad thing, it did make predicting the future of the show too easy for me.
All together, this anime was a good watch. Whether or mot is was a good anime is debatable, but it's not my place to say. Instead, I'll just say that this was a good watch and worth the time I invested into it.",7

                This will be a review of Tokyo Ghoul Season 1. The anime. Not the manga. 
 Do I believe Tokyo Ghoul is worthy of your time? 
Unequivocally, yes I do.
Story - This is a story that has been told in many anime before. I would, in fact, say it is THE story in action anime. Weak main character is 'special' in some way, and through training and conditioning becomes the hero that saves the town/country/universe. Tokyo Ghoul tells this story, but does it in such a way that it feels fresh. Almost like a deconstruction of the genre. The story unfolds with surprising (to me
                  anyway) care and nuance. This is a world that feels like it is teetering on the brink of disaster, and one wrong move will tip the scales. I particularly liked the villains. A hero is only as strong as his opposition, and here the opposition is worthy. 
Art - The battles are spread throughout the series and are the flashiest element. They do not disappoint. Character design is spot-on as well, with each character's look complementing their personality and role in the story. 
Sound - Music is perhaps my least favorite aspect, but its not terrible by any means. It just doesn't stand out the way some other series musical score does. I will mention the OP and ED's are excellent. Voice acting is quite good. 
Character - Any one of them taken individually isn't going to blow your mind, but the way they are handled. The way the fight scenes are properly motivated by character needs and desires. The character arcs. The way the antagonists mirror and are the opposite of the heroes. The relationships that develop over time. The author of this story clearly took tremendous care with crafting his characters, and it shows.
Enjoyment - This, at times, wasn't an easy show to watch: it is incredibly violent and gory. Especially the final arc. But it was never less than absorbing and entertaining. This show will make you realize why THIS story is such a cornerstone of action anime. If you go into it like I did - knowing nothing about it, I find it hard to imagine you will disappointed. 
10/10",10

                I have not finished the series yet but i shall attempt to write a review of what I know so far. If I am wrong, Just message me to correct me.
The story of the show is a masterpiece no doubt about it. The way the characters just tie together in one huge web is amazing. I also love the way they show the Doves as more than just an enemy they have to defeat, as real people with friends and family. My problem with this is that they didn't show this concept earlier in the show. They make you grow all this hatred for them
                  like when--
SPOILER ALERT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------they killed the little girl's (I forgot her name, sorry) okasan right in front of her, then show that they have friends and family so we could feel compassionate about them a few episodes later. I feel like that's a huge FUCK YOU to the audience. But other than that the story is amazing.
Art and drawing style in this anime are beautiful and unique. It really shows the emotion and intensity of the characters. Sadly that is all I could say about the animation.
Music is.... Just... Spectacular. Both themes for ending and intro are just energetic and match the shows mood perfectly. I would pick no other songs for it at all.
This is a show that you could binge watch and NEVER get bored. You'll never get a dull moment when watching it. It's action scenes are graphic and that's the way I like. And the eating scenes are, again, graphic just the way I love it.The show is NOT for the weak of stomach.
Overall this show deserves a perfect score. This show is definitely something
you should watch before January 9th, which is the day season two comes out. That's all I have for this review and I'll see you guys later.",10

                God dammit, Kaneki.
Animation: Tokyo Ghoul
   After just getting finished watching the last episode, reliving those delicious chills I always get from listening to the ending, I have come to the conclusion that I really enjoyed Tokyo Ghoul. I'll admit, I was over hyped at the beginning when the first few episodes were made available to the public, like a lot of other people. I calmed myself down and indulged myself with what was a decent anime overall.
Story: 6 
 The story was okay. Nothing that made me fall in to my screen face first like a fish in to water but it was
                  fair. After a certain event in the beginning, Kaneki is made to cope with the fact that he is now a ghoul and has to resist the fact that every human around him has now become a McDonald's meal. So wrong when you eat but so good that you don't care. 
Art: 8
   The art of Tokyo Ghoul is pretty good. Especially with how graphic they want to get. Doesn't looked dated and good colors all around. Even the opening and the ending were amazingly drawn and stylized. Sadly, a lot of the graphic content is smothered in darkness as to censor and block it from the younger viewers which is absolutely understandable. No one can cope with how gory it can get when you're a ghoul on these mean streets.
Sound: 8
   The music in both the opening and ending were great. I always catch myself singing along to either and these are songs I could definitely listen to without getting sick of them. Then I'd get sick of them and stop listening. The sounds within each episode were pretty good too, except if someone was getting beat down repeatedly and you heard the same exact sound over and over. They could have made increasingly worse sounds to reflect how beat up X character was. When someone was fighting or suffering, you could definitely tell, even if you were blindfolded. I don't know why you were watching it blindfolded IF you were but that's none of my business. Weirdo.
Character: 6
   I really wish the characters would have gotten a better back story. Something more than compressing their past problems, experiences and that one time they received a swirly from that one kid. Nothing for the mask maker who definitely had a few funny moments. Nothing for Kaneki's powerful, stoic, trainer. Nothing for the coffee shop keeper that helped him. I don't think there was much for his best friend Hide which was incredibly disappointing. These 12 episodes were nowhere near enough to help anyone appreciate the characters. Then again, 12 episodes is a short time to cope with finding out you're a ghoul. Or finding out you're pregnant. 
Enjoyment: 9
   Even for all it's faults, I still really enjoyed it for what it was. It may not be the most incredible anime to ever grace animation kind. but it is still a a good anime regardless. The main reason why I didn't given a 10 for enjoyment was for the reason that it felt very bare bones in it's 12 episode run. Barely any depth, character development outside the few close to the main character, and the story was pretty bare since they're trying to fit over 100 chapters in to 12 episodes, they skipped out on a lot. It's like buying a Snicker's and eating 3/4 then giving the rest to your best friend. You still love them and they know you do but they half jokingly flip you off. All in love, though.
Overall: 8
If you want a dark, action anime that's short, gory, and to the point, Tokyo Ghoul is something you don't wanna miss out on. I'd definitely give it a thumbs up and a recommendation.",8
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is maybe not your type of horror anime that composed of pure gore, torture and violence. I kinda reminds this anime that I watched before, it was ""Parasyte: The Maxim"" where Parasites are at the very top of the food chain, and the humans are below of it. Same way here on Tokyo Ghoul where the Ghouls are the top where the humans are at the bottom. Except not anyone likes to eat human flesh, there are also times that Ghouls can eat other ghouls as well. In the world where Ghouls were living, either anyone can be an enemy, a supportive friend,
                  or anyone can be a cannibal, psychopathic ghoul who likes to taste of their own kin. Whether it's a Ghoul eats other ghoul, or a hybrid eats another ghoul.
Tokyo Ghoul, I should say, is one of the darkest, story I've ever encountered since Death Note and Parasyte: The Maxim. It is a story full of vengeance, betrayal against of your own family member, loss of your love ones, the pain and suffering, philosophically questioning who and what you really are, the consequences your going to face if humans treated you in a wrong way, and wondering which is the real pests in the world, the humans or the ghouls.
Sad to say, from what I've saw, it looks like the story is kind of unfinished in terms of development (from what I believe though, because Studio Pierrot is known for developing the anime ""Naruto"", I guess that's the reason why the 1st season here is a bit complicated). Also, I don't feel like I'm going to watch the sequel of this season due to the negative feedback amongst the MAL community. But, from my point of perspective, I'd say it is a very decent anime that you should try for. If you like anything dark themed, then it is highly recommended to watch this anime, you will not be disappointed.",9
"
                I actually watched this anime a while ago, but never felt like giving my thoughts on it due to how much it frustrated me. It still frustrates me, but I'm writing a review anyway. 
I guess I'll go in order of my own ratings, and try to detail why I gave them that score. 
Story (4/10): I actually enjoy the premise of Tokyo Ghoul, and the story in the manga is much more fleshed out, and genuinely very good. This is an anime review however. I understand that there it's a big challenge to condense the contents of the manga into 12 episodes, but the
                  attempt was very lackluster. You get the basics, and not much more. Government vs. Ghouls with a side dish of some bad ghouls thrown into the mix. It's enough to get the idea of what you're watching, but without actually knowing anything really (if that makes sense).
Art (7/10): It's good. That's it really. Quality animation, that doesn't really get lazy. One of the good points of this anime. A lot of people mention the censorship; it's stupid, but not a huge issue.
Sound  (7/10): Unravel is a fantastic opening, and the ending is nice as well. Not an amazing score, but definitely noteworthy.
Character (3/10): This is the major downfall of the anime in my opinion. There is just so little to the characters that it's sad. Kaneki is obviously the focus, but his development is so poorly done that I don't find him even slightly interesting until the literal end of the series. On top of a main character that is bland, the supporting cast are either equally as bland, or have so little screen time that they feel like an afterthought. There are some shining stars that manage to stand out amongst the cast (The Gourmet and Mado come to mind), but they are quickly brushed aside to make room for Kaneki crying and Touka being Generic Tough Girl #1.
Enjoyment (5/10): I won't lie, there are some enjoyable moments to be found here. I found the scenes with the CCG to be among the best, and the last episode was the highlight of the series (not really hard to be the highlight of this series though :^) )
Overall (4/10): Objectively speaking, it's not horrible (subjectively speaking, I hate it because it butchered a fantastic manga). It's got some good things going for it, but the bad heavily outweighs those bright spots in my opinion. Overall, to me, this anime is very overrated. If you want something fulfilling and genuinely enjoyable, go read the manga. I'm not a manga elitist at all, but there are huge differences that make the manga a far better experience in this case.",4
"
                This has to be my second favourite Anime ever it provides everything I could want out of an anime from great action to interesting character, great art an awesome story and much more
Story
So the story didn't feel like anything special and was quite slow for a twelve episode season (root a changes that) and the main character Is a complete wimp up until the last episode  the idea is really cool and I like the way they approach the concept that all ghoul are definitively evil, the main character is a great example of this 
Art/action 
The art is really good and always set
                  the mood the action all was looks perfect. Basically my reaction to every fight is hell yeah that was awesome and all the weapons and kagunes (the ghouls powers) look awesome
Sound
the sound isn't bad it just isn't great the intro is food and suits the show but again the sound doesn't fell overly bad or overly special
Character 
So to preface every no character is black or white they are all morally grey and I love that but a lot of people might hate that. There are a lot of good well thought out and interesting character but there are also so a few character that fell very mundane and boring but that is mainly due to a lack of character development of backstory and a lot don't have they're backstory explain until season 2 
Overall 9/10
I throughly enjoy Tokyo ghoul I think it is all most perfect and just needs to have more character development and backstory sooner but beside that everything is perfect from the action to the darkness and gore so If you like action, philosophy, gore or just generally dark shows this is for you and to anyone less I recommend it",9

                WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!
When I decided to watch this (three days ago), I had not seen a psychological anime in a very long time. I think the last time I saw one was before I'd even heard of MyAnimeList. The first ten episodes of the anime were fantastic. The characters were well-developed, the art and voice acting were great, the story was original, but then Kaneki got kidnapped. By this time, I had thought this anime wasn't that serious in its psychological-ness. Sure there are some parts where some people might find it mindblowingly psychological, but I didn't.
So Kaneki gets taken, I freak out when Banjou
                  and the other two are saying they'll get him out. I freak out more when Touka lets Tsukiyama help get him back and then it goes back to Kaneki and Rize and his hair is white and I'm like, ""So the guy in the opening was Kaneki"". I like died when he got out because he was in a totally different mindset and stuff. Don't get me wrong, I understand why, and I think it makes a lot more sense than a ton of other shows I've seen, but I just absolutely hated the ending. It made me dislike Rize more and it changed how I felt about Kaneki.
And the worst part of the ending was that it left me feeling really incomplete. I plan to watch the second season, but at this point I have no idea what happened to Touka, Hinami, the manager and all the others. Not to mention that I'm reluctant to watch it because the Kaneki in the last few minutes of episode 12 reminded me too much of Accelerator from A Certain Scientific Railgun and A Certain Magical Index (Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S and Toaru Majutsu no Index).
But overall, Tokyo Ghoul was a great anime, and a horribly good way to rethink how I felt about psychological anime.",9
"
                Now if your average joe watched this anime and then thought to themselves ""That was great."" Then they are left with a emptiness in their heart. So what do they do? They read the manga. Then what happens once they read the manga? They realise that there is a lot of things that are different. Which is sad. When you adapt something, you should at least make it some what close to home. Not kick the ball to North America. Although what is done is done and the opinions have to be said. Lets go on Tokyo Ghoul, not Ghouls.
Story 6/10 In all seriousness it
                  was a good psychological story, with some stuff going good. Although if you look pass the psychological stuff, what you have is a MC that is useless, flashy colours and people die in this anime! Who would've known? Has the word Ghoul in it, its expected. 
Art 8/10 The art looks decent, but its at best in battle. Also the psychological moments, because the art is hella good at those times. Then you see flashy colours which is a good thing.
Sound 7/10 Worthy mention the opening is epic in this one, you can feel the umph in it. No seriously you can. The music in anime is kinda meh, I really couldn't tell if there was music in the background to be honest because I kept seeing flashy colours. Although I did hear some of the music in the background and I gotta say its pretty good.
Characters 6/10 I gotta say, the MC is really unbearable for me. He's useless absolutely useless. Unless its about books, the other characters actually pick up his slack a little because they are quite useful. Now depending who you are looking at and why it can change you view on things. If you look at Nishijo you will feel sad, if your looking at Tohka you will feel that you need to keep close to your parents. If you look at MC for some odd reason, then I don't even know what you would feel. Maybe be boss and no overworking in life? 
Enjoyment 8/10 I gotta say, it was pretty enjoyable at times even if the MC was useless as hell.
Overall 6/10 Its not the best, but it is good to show an average joe. They will probably like it and they may not see the faults. You might not know its pretty good if your just watching it for fun.",6
"
                I really like those anime who have action packed with drama. These fighting scenes remembered me of Elfen lied. Blood Blood everywhere during fight. I really would have watched it in one go, if I would not have to go to college. Character development for (Kaneki, Ken) protagonist  was perfect. I like plotty anime in which main character is trying to do something, trying to survive or thinking about world/society.
In the end, my definition for enjoyment is that which I can marathon crazily with super crazy plot. And Tokyo Ghoul fits in right.

"
                (This review is for the both seasons) NO SPOILERS
Story(8) A really good beginning in the first season with an original and interesting plot, a guy who become a ghoul(a monster fed with human flesh), which turn into something less attractive in the second season, it became something more ordinary and disappointing unfortunately because this anime had a real potential.
Art(8) The drawings are quite good and the animation is very appreciable! The chara-design is well-done: the personality of each character is good representation of their personality! Enjoyable for the eyes!
Sound(8) Good soundtrack, especially ""Glassy Sky"" of Donna Burke. The OST is present, pleasant to hear but
                  not particularly memorable in my mind.
Character(7) I longly hesitated between the 7 or the 8 because I didn't like the evolution of some of the characters. The majority of them seems to me useless in the second season. Less present, less pleasant sadly.
Enjoyment and Overall(8) Tokyo Ghoul is still a very good anime despite the second season, enjoyable to watch. I recommend it but nothing more to say.",8
"
                well what can i say about this anime ... lets start with why you should watch it and why did i watch it .?  i was bored and looking for random anime and found it and i was a bit curious about it so i watched the first episode and i gotta say the story wasn't very good at the beginning but i kept watching and it only got better and interesting and more mysterious.I didn't realize that i watched all the 12 episodes in a row ... that's how good it was then i was really addicted to Tokyo ghoul so i started
                  digging around and found that there was going to be a second season for it .. so i watched it while it was airing and damn it was good full of emotions and plots and everything you want in an anime So if you have time to watch it then why not ? am very sure you'll love it and you might wanna check the manga because it's different from the anime but if you don't read manga like me then you'll enjoy this to the limit and if you read manga then yeah yeah i know they changed a lot of stuff but still ... it is a master piece .so check it out ;)
.....Forgot to mention 
positive points : very good story, nice OP and ED , the art work for the ED in season 2 is a masterpiece,character development is interesting to follow, never fails to impress you after each episode 
negative points: didn't follow the manga,the way both seasons end is very irritating,will leave a scar in your heart for a while after you finish the series besides that it's perfect",9
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is one of those rare supernatural Anime that creates it's own world for you to feel involved in.  There is good character development with diversity among each, and a fantastic storyline to go with it; It's a example of doing a lot with a simple theme.  The Animation/Art is very good, and the soundtrack is excellent, and matches with the theme very well.
When you read these reviews, PLEASE check to see how much Anime that user has actually watched before giving their review ANY credibility.  Quite a few people that are new to Anime have given Tokyo Ghoul (completely undeserved)
                  low ratings.
It's a Great Anime, and you should NOT pass up on it!",9
"
                This anime isn't the best but I still enjoyed it overall. Somethings to keep in mind for those interested in Tokyo Ghoul: 
- The manga by Sui Ishida is amazing. But this anime doesn't do the original story justice because the adaption is rushed and certain arcs were majorly changed. 
- The best way to enjoy this anime is to watch the 12 episode 1st season only and treat it as a trailer to the manga. It's a great introduction into seinen tragedy/action/horror genre. Most people who jump from popular battle shonen usually like Tokyo Ghoul for similar experiences but a darker story. 
- Even
                  though recent reviews have rated TG pretty low, this was a huge show when it came out several years ago. I still rewatch it once in a while. There's just certain aspects (no spoilers) this show just does right despite its setbacks. I still highly suggest anyone who hasn't seen it to just give the 1st season a try and judge the show on your own terms.",8
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is a really jaw dropping anime for me with all of the crazy action scenes and the such bloody gory scenes. It is literally intense about every episode which i really like. I wish there could have been more then 12 episodes but it is confirmed there will be a season 2 to this anime so I'm pretty excited about that. This anime is basically about Ghouls which are these human looking monsters who basically feed on human flesh to survive. I really have nothing to complain about this anime besides how short is actually is the artwork is on key and so
                  is the actual story I'm not too big into a bunch of gory action type anime but the last couple I have watched have been very great i recommend this to any anime lover it was a great entertaining series and i literally couldn't stop watching!",10
"
                I'm just gonna come out and say what I wanna say. Tokyo Ghoul is good. It is enjoyable. The characters are pretty good. The op is pretty good. The ending is not a conclusion at all, but there's a second season, so we can let that slide a little.
Yes I recommend this show, but it is not a must-watch like Hunter x Hunter (2011) or FMA or even One Punch Man. 
It is great for what it is and if you enjoy supernatural shows with a ton of violence you will enjoy this. 
But this is where I will give my warning. 
Tokyo Ghoul is
                  NOT and I will repeat it, NOT for the faint of heart. There is some SERIOUSLY heavy stuff in here and if you can't handle it, you will probably puke many times during the course of this show. 
There is plenty of blood and murder. Cannibalism and Suicide. The Ghouls devour humans. Just, a lot of violence and plenty of swearing.
But that's not what should make you hesitate. You should hesitate because of the three episodes almost entirely devoted to the torture of one character. And it really is quite disturbing. Especially what they do after. So, if you don't think you can handle that, don't click play. Watch something else. If you think you can handle it, go ahead. You'll probably enjoy yourself.",7
"
                Tokyo Ghoul took the anime world by storm in 2014 and received large praise. While I think this anime is a tad overrated, I still found a large amount of enjoyment in watching this anime. What I liked about this anime was first off, the story, I enjoyed the story heavily it was dark interesting and the setting and atmosphere were very good. The animation as very good as well though the censoring was a bit bothersome at times. The music was solid and the opening theme,Unravel by TK is possibly one of the greatest anime opening themes I've ever heard.However I had a couple
                  of problems with this anime, one is the characters. Now I liked the characters but I felt that some of them just felt one dimensional, notable examples being our main protagonist. The characters weren't bad or unrelataable by any means,I just wish they had a little more substance. Though I did enjoy the characters of Nishki and Hinami in particular. Another problem is the aforementioned censorship, I know you can find uncensored versions but usually you'll be watching the censored version and it will feel distracting at certain points. And finally I would have liked a bit more quality action scenes. Like some were good and others were average. In conclusion Tokyo ghoul is a fun,dark anime that is definitely worth watching despite my gripes with it.",7

                STORY:
Out of all the vampire/Ghoul animes I have watched, sadly this one was the least of my favorites. The story doesn't seem very interesting or intense because it isn't original and its confusing. It seems like they are trying to make you feel sympathy for the ghouls but they don't portray them as great people. Like Shiki, it somewhat has the idea of showing ""who is really the bad guy,"" or ""is anyone really bad?"" But in this anime it is very ONE SIDED. It only shows the point of view of Ghouls, which seems weird because Kaneki was human but doesnt show any sympathy
                  for humans. It only makes it seem like ghouls are the nice innocent ones who does nothing wrong even though they murder people. The ghouls seem to not give a crap that they have to eat human at all so its hard to feel sympathy for something that doesnt seem like they are forced to do it or like they have no choice. It would be great if they also should how humans feel when they are preyed upon or elaborate on how Kaneki, who was once human, has to eat his own kind because then it really hypes up the conflict and would really get you thinking.
CHARACTER:
Honestly, the main character seems very pathetic. He relies on people to tell him what to do all the time and rarely thinks and acts for himself in my opinion. It deosnt really make sense that he is half human and ghoul because he has most of the characteristics of a ghoul.  He doesnt even at least think like a human because he feels more sympathy for the ghouls and easily go to their side. He lacks the morals of a human. The other characters dont seem that interesting nor important because it seems that the anime doesnt build up on them.
ENJOYMENT:
I was honestly bored with the story.  It seems like most of the episodes is about them trying or thinking about eating. It seems like that is all the story talks about, them eating but not really the theme of ""who really is the bad guy,"" like people say it is. It just seems a bit like the story ripped off of Shiki a little. Im not trying to say that they are really similar because they arent really. This story lacks suspense and mystery even though it falls under the category of mystery sometimes. The main character quickly got into the ghouls side without needing to be convinced even though he spent most of his life as a human, so viewers cant really question which side he will be on.
ART:
This anime's art isnt anything unique but it also isnt bad, its just okay. I have seen lots of fan art and stuff with Kaneki in a mask and it looks really cool but the anime's art doesnt have that coolness. From the first episode, I was thinking that the animation would be great like every other over hyped anime but over time it didnt seem that spectacular. The end of the first episode animation was good though. Some their reactions freezes in time and it makes the scenes look awkward.
Overall this anime just seemed over hype. If you are looking for a good vampire anime with action I suggest you watch Hellsing(or hellsing ultimate)",5

                Tokyo ghoul an anime adapted from the Manga with the same name is an anime with a good story and concept that the anime fails to portray properly .
The story of tokyo ghoul is interesting with proper development of the main character as the series progress  but the anime fails to portray some of its concepts because of squeezing a lot of manga chapters to an 12 episodes anime. Hence, a poorly constructed and damaged character development.
Art - The background and atmosphere is good and  it really fits the anime with its dark setting. The animation is good and fluid especially in
                  the fighting scenes. There are times though the characters looked a little bit weird.
Sounds- The OP and ED song fits the anime as the opening portrays the transformation of the main protagonist. The VA is great as they fit their characters perfectly.
Characters- the anime also fails to show some of the characters'development throughout the anime, particularly the main protagonist.Some characters are completely disregarded.
Overall, the anime is fun to watch with its fluid fighting animations, great VA and OP & ED, but because of being a 12 episodes anime, the story and character development suffers.",6

                Who cares about story,sound,art and other things when you can have 100% enjoyment.Yes,this anime all about enjoyment but other aspect of this anime are also very good.It's very much worth watching because it is filled with excitement and addiction.
The opening song is so good that it does not hurt n o matter ow many time you listen it.The best thing about this anime is once you get on its pace it will not let go.But do not expect to much from this anime because they have saved the best for second season.It's follows the story of MAGICARP like protagonist evolving into the mighty GARADOS and
                  being ready to wipe everyone who has caused him trouble.Yes this evolution is very slow but powerful and that is what we call as badass.
The art is done very fairly,character are developed fairly and sound is super exciting and makes your blood boil.
 There are only one bad things about this anime and that is Censoring.uncensored version would have impressed viewers more.
Anime who watches anime for fun should not miss this one because it's a package of fun,excitement,blood,gore and heavy action...",8
"
                I have to admit, I was anxious to watch this anime. For all I knew, it was a gore anime that I had no person around to tell me it was good or introduce it to me. But, I'm very glad today I decided to watch it. I knew it was based off a manga, with everybody on the internet saying that the manga was better, but I had not yet started reading manga, so I didn't think of it. The anime is outstanding above all. It has  high-quality animation and sound combined with a great story that pulled me into the universe of
                  Tokyo Ghoul. Over all, I'd rate this anime 10/10. It may not be everybody, especially if you have read the manga or are not into gore anime, but I would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a new, interesting anime.",10

                DO NOT READ, I DID NOT FINISH
Before reading this keep this in mind.
If you read the manga and want to watch it, don't. When people make reviews about this anime, they always have to compare something to the manga. This is an ANIME review. An anime can still be good even if it has nothing to do with the manga (most of the time). If you did watch the manga and you are going to watch this, please enjoy this without making comparisons to the manga
Story
The beginning of the story was a fantastic start. It brang lots of hype. This is a pretty gory anime
                  and show a lot of pain in all forms.  The fighting was decently balanced with the story. I felt very emotional with this story and I like getting that feeling to stories like this. Makes watching the anime much better, you can say it gives you a better experience. It was said that is was going to be 24 episode so I was really looking forward to it, however, due to their lack of funding, it became 12 episodes. This hindered the story greatly since it was being rushed. All the complaints started at this point. To be honest it was rushed however it was still good to watch. I hear that they are going to make a second season so hopefully it will satisfy those that were not. The ending was Extremely sadistic and can literally mess you up, if you have a weak mind, I highly recommend not watching. In my opinion, the best episodes were the first and the last because those two were not rushed. The story makes you decide who to sympathize for, the Ghouls or the Humans. should have had it tough and it makes them look",10
"
                When I first saw this come out, my first impression was that it was going to be another boring dark zombie type anime. But NO. The best things that I love personally are GORE, VIOLENCE and BLOOD. Yes this was what I was waiting for. Another type of hellsing/berserk type violence. The intense battles and cool super powers are just the tip of the ice berg. What made this anime also unique is that the author had brilliantly thought of how the ghouls possess their own set of eating habits, powers and separate factions. Now as for the downside of things, some of the characters
                  just briefly appear and we don't know enough about them or how strong they are. I guess it's what you would expect from 12 episodes. Also, as for some scenes, there are times when you just say to yourself, what just happened and why did they do that? You get the feeling that some characters could have used common sense, but overall I loved the anime.",9
"
                The most frustrating part of this show is that it could have actually had a meaning. Instead, the only real desire it brought upon watching, was a reinforced want to buy a French press. From the poorly executed themes of equality, to the absolutely abysmal character progression. You can tell this show was slapped together with too much from the source material, and it never actually did anything with it. The only good parts of the show were the music, the episode exploring regular ghoul life, and then the final 5 minutes of the last episode. Everything else was executed terribly. So much so in
                  some portions, that I was left with no choice but to turn away from the show in disgust after watching people have their limbs ripped off. The torture scene toward the end, while I understand what it meant, was shot in poor taste. I don't need to see people have their fingers and toes ripped off, and have a form of psychological torture demonstrated to the point fetishization rivaled by that of edgy teenage fangirls who swoon about series killers because they're ""mysterious"".",2
"
                Perfect pacing. 
I've not watched an anime that has better pacing than this one. It is just goddamn beautiful. Not a single scene felt wasted. Every single shot was essential. Not a single second was wasted on a character that will not further the plot, irrespective of how strong they were.
And the other important thing, that I'm going to specifically point out and appreciate in this anime, is it's focus. There is no tension because of an implied romance (doesn't mean that there isn't any). No entire episodes wasted on the backstory of some side character. Despite this, the viewers get a pretty decent idea
                  of what each character is about, and what they value. 
And that ending, despite it leaving the story hanging, was so beautifully done. Two words. Character growth.
Amazing characters, a well-written story, spot-on pacing, why is this not a 10? What does this anime lack that the anime that I have given a 10 to (like Oregairu, Clannad AS, HunterxHunter) have? You cannot really put a finger on it can you? It comes down to personal preference I suppose.
Anyway, the finale gave us this wonderful quote, ""It may seem like you're choosing both, but, really, you're forsaking both"". Go take it and apply it to your life.
But before that, watch Tokyo Ghoul, the story of a first date gone wrong.",9
"
                This has to be one of my new favorite animes. At first, I thought kaneki was a sissy bitch, but as the story progressed, so did his character. And by the end of this masterpiece, I was left clamoring for more.The storyline was dark and the art was, to me, perfectly fitting for the anime, as was the music.  
And lets be serious, this anime was better than eating chicken nuggets... and nothing is better than eating chicken nuggets... Anyways, if you liked Shiki or even Attack On Titan, you'll like this anime. 
              ",10
"
                What would you do, if your normal human life suddenly turned upside down, and your only means of survival was eating other humans?
Question like that appeared after the very first episode and I knew then that this show's gonna be awesome. There was not a second I was bored watching it, and I even talked about it with friends I know never, ever will watch anime, let alone this particular show.
This anime's story is deep and meaningful, and does never get lost in some kind of comic relief or anything. It keeps to its style right to the very end. 
Art may seem a bit
                  faulty at times, but you forget that when the fighting scenes start - I can't remember any anime moments that were so intense.
And the sound! Even if the whole screen was black for a moment and all you could hear was the crack of someone's finger breaking, the feeling was perhaps even more stronger, for you relied only on your hearing.
Character design was as detailed and carefully managed as well as character's personality, background story, everything. You get to really know them all and understand them, and maybe end up cheering for some of them or wishing that they were dead, or that is just me getting too involved.
I have enjoyed every moment of this show, and at more than a few times reminded myself to watch it again. Especially 'cause of the opening sequence, which I enjoyed a lot. And I'm not gonna spoil anything, but everything seemingly builds up to the last episode which was, without a doubt, the most amazing finale I've seen in quite a while. I felt goosebumps on more than one occasion during that episode.
Definitely worth your time.",10
"
                I don't understand why some people are giving this anime such a bad rap! All what I see in the review section is negative comments.  I found this anime to be quite good considering it was only twelve episodes. Not only that but it had pretty good character development during the episodes.  I thought the story line was engaging and it kept me on the edge of my seat.  I found the art style to be great and realistic as an anime could get.  However I think this anime would be better if there was more episodes and it not ending
                  in a cliffhanger.",10
"
                Let me just say as a side note, the first thing I thought when scouting out tokyo ghoul a few weeks back was Another.(http://myanimelist.net/anime/11111/Another)  The eyepatch on Kaneki just reminded me of Misaka from Another.  I will say that I have not read the manga at all so this will be a strict review of the anime itself.  You won't see any complaints about arc switching or covering too few or too many chapters here.  
Sound - I liked it...
Now, normally I don't like watching OPs or EDs of anime.  A lot of the time it spoils the mood with
                  the unchanging song during the climax of the anime.  As such, I usually skip past the OP and start the next episode before the ED.  This was not the case with Tokyo Ghoul(sort of.)  From the very first episode I found that I immensely enjoyed listening to the OP.  With such a short anime (1-cour), the OP pretty much fit the mood for every episode.  But even with such an amazing OP, I did not enjoy the ED at all.  Even right now just after finishing the last episode I can hardly remember the beginning of the song simply because I barely listened to it.  As for the background music, to me, it's a matter of did it stand out, or did it blend nicely?  In Tokyo Ghoul, all I can really say is it blended in nicely.  I mean, it's background music.  I hear it, it fits the mood, and it changes.
Story - Good enough
After watching the opening of the first episode, I noticed Kaneki with white hair instead of black hair.  Hair changing in anime usually means  the character becomes a badass. As someone with absolutely no background knowledge, this was pretty much the one thing I was looking forward to in the beginning.  Thrust into the ghoul world pretty quickly, Kaneki struggles with the morality of eating people.  He is forced to live on the grey line that divides ghouls and humans.  The beginning of Tokyo Ghoul allowed the story to go in many places.  So, when the story slowly unraveled, it's safe to say I had higher hopes.  Still, throughout most of the anime, I was kept on my toes, waiting for the appearance of white-haired Kaneki.  Suffice it to say, I didn't want it to end at episode 12.  The story was good enough that I'll probably be reading the manga in the near future.(something I rarely do.)
Character - ehh
While the character development was quite good, each side character got a little mini-arc of their own, and then proceeded to scarcely show up for the rest of the anime.  When one such side character was brought back in the end for the climax, the only thing I could really think about was, this is really cheesy.  While I do realize there was only 12 episodes to work with, the amount of screen time each character got felt a little short.  Rize had one of the weirdest roles in the anime.  Trying to incorporate her into the anime was quite awkward at times.  The main problem with Tokyo Ghoul's characterization was simply because there were too many characters.  Many characters could've had a completely different personality and it wouldn't have affected the story at all.  They're pretty much there to fill up time and space.  I'm not talking about person 924 in the crowd on the streets, I'm talking about much of the ""police force.""  For example, one of the commanders just irrationally gives out orders and gets angry at pretty much everything.  He doesn't even need to be there and things would still work out.   Also, the whole police side of Tokyo Ghoul was really left untouched and had a lot of room to expand.  Mado is really the only ""policeman"" who actually has any decent character.  Still, the characterization wasn't bad and for the main characters, it was very good.
Enjoyment - interesting
As the anime was airing, I did in fact watch each episode the day it came out.  It was that good.  There are some memorable scenes that people poke fun at and the ending was a particularly powerful one, especially for an anime that's only 12 episodes.  If I had to rate this, which I do, I would give this a 9/10.  Don't ask me why, it's just an arbitrary number for MAL.",9
"
                This anime is AMAZING!
I was originally sceptical because I thought Tokyo Ghoul was only popular because it was violent and graphic, but after watching it I was astonished by how complex and well constructed it was.
First of all the music is fantastic, especially what is probably regarded as the flagship of the OST, the track ""Licht und Schatten"" which always seems to cature the spirit of the moment when it plays during the show. The opening theme has an outstanding vocal performance and the ending theme is so groovy that I could listen to it on repeat for hours on end.
Visually it looks beautiful, the
                  color palette tends to be very plain for the most part and then they bring in the sharper colors for the intense and important scenes.
Storywise this show takes a very basic setting: ""Us vs. Them!"", The Humans vs. The Ghouls, and manages to make it so nuanced that you can't say that one side is the good guys and the other the bad guys, there is both good and evil characters on either side of the spectrum and it will have you second guessing your own judgement on characters as you learn about their individual circumstances and motivations. The finale was absolutely mindblowing, now ofcourse I won't write any spoilers, all I can say is that Kaneki has an epiphany based on something very fucked up.
The characters deal with themes like guilt, acceptance in society, helplessness, grief, good vs. evil, and losing control to your urges. Both sides of society, human and ghoul respectively, believe themselves to be fully in the right and believe the opposition to be fully in the wrong, but as the story progresses various characters starts to doubt this motion.
All in all I can't help but give this show a 10/10 because I truly enjoyed it and was totally mindblown after the finale. I never got bored, there's no characters I found annoying (which happens alot in anime), and it kept me on the edge of my seat. At the end of an episode I would on one hand be like ""Iwant to watch what happens next NOW!"", and on the other ""But I can't skip this song it's so GOOD!""",10
"
                I feel obligated to defend Tokyo Ghoul because I think that most people who dislike the show fail to recognize the clever messages that Sui Ishida is trying to deliver.
***************MAJOR SPOILERS********************************************
The claim that ""The manga is better than the anime"", though likely true, is misleading and should be rephrased as ""The second half of the manga is better that root A"". Why? Well because the first season of Tokyo ghoul was more or less a faithful adaptation of the manga's first half. 
The only minor events cut out of the manga through adaptation that I noticed are:
-Touka training kaneki and breaking his finger.
- Hide and
                  Kaneki getting burgers right after kaneki became a ghoul
- Touka and Kaneki going to the CCG to provide false information to lure Mado to a river nearby a school, though the anime still implied that this event happened off-screen.
-A brief backstory involving Rize and Banjo
- The events leading up to Kaneki’s capture by Jason are slightly more detailed.
None of these events have any major significance on the quality of characterization:
-Regarding the first event, Touka was already established as a rough character in episode 1.
-The anime establishes Kaneki’s struggle with keeping his secret from Hide as well as his inability to eat human food.
-Mado is shown in Amon’s backstory to have great intuition for spotting ghouls,   so the third event isn’t needed.
-The backstory is nice, but it is so brief that losing it does not mean much.
-Kaneki’s capture this time tells you a bit about Aogiri but nothing overly important.
All of the major events in the manga were faithfully replicated in the show. Now to explain why I like this show as much as I do. 
Season 1 of Tokyo ghoul has two major focuses:
Focus #1.	Kaneki’s suffering due to his refusal to make selfish decisions; he adopts his late mothers’ philosophy “It is better to be hurt than to hurt others” for almost the entire season, only to finally reject it in episode 12.
Focus #2.	The development of the relationship between Kaneki and Touka.
Focus #1
When Kaneki first becomes a ghoul he experiences conflict between two desires:
1. The desire to interact with all people in an altruistic way. 
2. The desire to survive, which necessarily involves eating human flesh as well as a willingness to defend oneself against attackers which are either ghoul or human.
This conflict is shown at multiple points:
-He is unwilling to take his first bite of human flesh in episode 1.
-His desire for flesh overcomes his desire to keep his friend Hide when his hunger becomes too great. Touka has to step in to prevent tragedy from occurring in episode 2.
-During Kaneki’s fight with Amon, Kaneki tries to initially stop him without using excess force though he eventually gives in to his ghoul side and viciously attacks Amon in order to help Touka.
-Episode 12 is where Kaneki’s most interesting development occurs. Sui Ishida exposes the naivety of the mindset that “You should always put other people before yourself”. By considering the backstory of Kaneki’s mother, he makes 2 key arguments:
1. If you show altruism towards inconsiderate people, you will suffer. Note that by altruism I mean helping other people at your own cost which is different to simply helping others. Kaneki suffers for trying to put the needs of the psychopathic Jason before his own, just like his mother who suffered for putting the needs of the lazy and manipulative sister before her own. This is reasonable: “Why would someone be satisfied with themselves for helping someone who is not deserving of help”?
2. Time spent showing altruism towards inconsiderate people is time not spent showing altruism towards considerate people who actually deserve it. Kaneki’s mother ended up neglecting her son because time which could’ve been spent taking care of him what instead used to try and financially support her sister. Kaneki showing altruism towards Jason meant that Touka’s life was left in danger, though she would’ve been fine if Kaneki simply fought back at Anteiku. Kaneki expresses anger at his mother’s decision to care for her sister as opposed to her son. 
So Sui Ishida exposes the philosophy of Kaneki’s mother as one that is often masochistic and immoral. He argues for the importance of selfishness in certain situations, and what is clever about all of this is how he uses the purely selfish character Rize to help Kaneki become a better person by learning to be more selfish when dealing with cruel people. Kaneki accepts the ghoul part of himself i.e. the part that is selfish.
Sui Ishida, through Kaneki’s character, offers the meaningful life lesson: “Only go to great lengths to help someone if and only if that person is good and shares a close relationship with you”.
Focus #2
When Kaneki first meets Touka, the two don’t get along for the following reasons:
1.	Touka dislikes Kaneki for his lack of sympathy. He focuses only on his own pain while disregarding any negative experiences that Touka is afflicted by. 
2.	Kaneki dislikes Touka for her aggressiveness and rough nature. Her lack of friendliness makes her seem like a cruel person.
As the show progresses the two characters grow closer by having their initial impressions of each other challenged. 
Kaneki becomes more understanding of Touka and sees her as a good person. He notices the following:
-Her grumpy attitude is partly due to how hard she works; she balances school with a job at Anteiku and also keeps up her strength as a ghoul.
-She appreciates the effort that her friend Yoriko makes by consuming the food she cooked even though it makes her ill.
-She feels guilty over killing one of the doves so Kaneki realises that she only harms to protect herself and the people around her; she is in no way psychopathic.
Touka realises that Kaneki is a sympathetic person through the following events:
-Kaneki shows kindness towards Hinami by helping her improve at reading.
-Kaneki apologizes to Touka after the gourmet incident for bringing up her friend Yoriko.
-After Touka gets injured fighting the doves, Kaneki says that he’d be upset if Touka died and then offers to help her. 
-Kaneki compliments Touka for how she cut Hinami’s hair.
Note that at the beginning of Tokyo Ghoul, Touka only helped Kaneki because she was ordered to by Yoshimura. By the end, Touka was willing to go against Yoshimura’s intentions when he said that there was no point in trying to save Kaneki; Touka has developed a deep concern for Kaneki’s well-being in spite of initially hating him. 
What makes Touka an interesting character is that she shows that there is more to being a good person than merely being friendly: She is a hard-worker; has a conscience; appreciates the good intentions of others; is willing to listen to Kaneki’s advice and has a strong desire to protect those who are close to her. Characters like Rem for Re: Zero are easy to love for their kindness and affection whereas characters like Touka can only be appreciated if one is able to judge a characters’ kindness based on more than just friendliness.
As far as soundtrack and animation are concerned, I was more than satisfied. The tracks Licht Und Schatten and Unravel are two of my favourite tracks in all of anime.
That’s all I really have to say about season 1 of Tokyo Ghoul and I really do feel that this anime is underappreciated by the anime community. I think it is silly to write this off as a show that only appeals to edge-lords when this show makes its characters suffer so that they can grow and not just for the sake of shock value. The easy to follow plot; the fast pacing; the great soundtrack and visuals and the shows well-handled relationship coupled with a clever critique of universal altruism make Tokyo Ghoul, I think, one of the best stories to check out for newcomers to anime.",10

                *Minor Spoilers,without great impact on story*
I've watched Tokyo Ghoul as a recommendation of friend back in 2014 when it was coming out and I was witnessing my cringy ""otaku"" phase,it was 10/10.I rewatched it very recently,and man the thoughts can change by the time.
Story:3
Story mainly focuses on Kaneki Ken who becomes a ghoul by the night.As the story progress,Kaneki struggles between two factions-Ghouls and Humans.Did the story have depth?It wanted to have,yet failed.Tokyo Ghoul had interesting premise that failed to present it and process it into something good.It had themes such as Grey Morality and different perceptions between factions.
As for grey morality,we can't know anything
                  deeper than the fact that there are Ghouls who don't want to eat humans and Ghouls that want to,but that isn't 
D E P T H we're talking about!Even those ""Good"" ghouls eat humans and kill them,so what's the point?Moral philosophy was very bad written.As for factions' perceptions on each other and Kaneki's crisis to overcome the fact that he became opposite of what he was-It didn't have any real depth or symbolism as fans say it has.Kaneki in last episode just--joined Aogiri,without any reason since they tortured them,or atleast he had reason but anime didn't say so.
Characters:2
I'll keep in mind that characters are grey and transparent in world/factions.
Tokyo Ghoul gave a good example of how NOT to write character's transparency and background.There are many things that I can give example of why Tokyo Ghoul's characters lacks backstory.Kaneki refused to eat human in the beggining,but in the end he joined Aogiri,the ghoul terrorist organization that was torturing him.Why?We would know why if he had some backstory and explanation of his choices,although we keep in mind that he WAS good and so he can't be evil blah blah blah.Touka hates her brother because?He eats humans?So what,Touka grew up with the same person and lived in a ghoul society which was oriented towards eating humans (also,Ayato wasn't presented even a bit as grey character,yet completely black).Tsukiyama (Pedo meme in community) wanted to eat Kaneki,but why?Most characters were there because shock factor and it wasn't explained why have they gone mad.As for Nishiki,he just changed his personality in an instant,but we don't know his backstory,so we shouldn't put theories,it was writer's fault.
Sound:4
Honestly,the lyrics of first opening gave us the idea of what it will be,although it wasn't something OH MY GOD 10/10.Sounds were ok,voice actors too I guess,but nothing spectacular,it didn't gave any hype during battles or anything.
Art:5
As art I use animation quality and ""emo-bar"" (How emo characters looked and stuff,don't forget Skrillex).Animation was ok,nothing special,for 2014,it was very average.
Enjoyment:2
Atleast shock factors were something more than average,heh...
Overall:3
Tokyo Ghoul anime isn't something with deep symbolism,themes or anything.It is gore fest with cancerous fanbase.Manga is NOT any better than anime,but hey,there is Root A,even worse season than first.If you want something that has existential philosophy and morality questions,watch Ghost in the Shell.If you want something with infestations and symbiosis with monsters/aliens/viruses,watch Parasyte (even though I'm too lazy to watch something with gore stuff)",3
"
                ""This world is wrong.""
If I eat some human necessarily to satisfy my hunger, am I wrong?
If I kill someone to prevent them from eating my species, am I wrong?
These are the two fundamental questions that drives the whole story, and really interesting indeed.
I first found out about TG on those anime season preview sites and read its manga before its anime got published as the story interest me. Of course this wouldn't affect my review of the anime, gonna keep it as objective as possible. But the anime really pales in comparison to its manga (well that is true for a lot of anime that
                  follows a manga).
The story is something new to me. A species called ghouls that feast on humans to subdue their hunger and the story takes place in Tokyo, so Tokyo Ghoul (yeah...). It features a teenage boy that unexpectedly met a ghoul and reached the end of his life(?). That's all I will say because more of it would be a spoiler. It's something fresh so I was tempted to give it a 9. But the whole thing feels so rushed to me, maybe because they have to cramp everything into 24 episodes (yes, there's a season 2 coming so I'm taking that into consideration as well). So I gave it an 8 at the end.
The art is good, not superb but does the job, a 7 probably. The sound is not as pleasing to me, but the OP by TK from LTS totally rocked the socks so an 8 from me. I'm not really good at judging art and sound so this may not be very accurate.
The characters are good. A protagonist that developed from a weakling to something respectable. Protagonist's friends that are really cool and helpful. And to top it off, a not-so-clear antagonist (its sort of a 3-way battle) which I really like.
Overall, I enjoyed it (not as much as the manga) so I gave it an 8.
However if I were to compare it to what it could have achieved, from what I see in the manga, it would probably have been a 4-5. That's how badly done the adaptation is, give this to MADHOUSE and maybe we can see some wonderful gore.
It's still in my recommended list, but its quite far back in the list. If you are those hardcore anime-only people (like me, the only manga that I read was this and some Korean ones), this can probably pass off as good/okay. But if you have the time and don't mind some silent reading, GO READ THE MANGA.",8
"
                After hearing that it was largely considered ""psychological"", I started watching this popular anime optimistically. I must say that the first time I watched it through, I was keenly disappointed. There was nothing new, nothing that really made me think-- nothing that would lead me to call this a ""psychological"" show. However, watching it the second time, I could understand why some people found it though-provoking. Newbies to the fantasy-horror-supernatural genre would be fascinated by the concept of living as a Ghoul, of the animalistic desire to kill to eat, or they may be interested in what it would be like to be a Ghoul
                  Investigator. All of these are interesting concepts to consider; however, for those well-versed in monster-related shows and books, it's all quite elementary. 
The things that immediately struck me as ""good"" in this show were its soundtrack and its ability to give you your weekly gore-fix. If you're the type who needs to see some trauma and violence now and then, Tokyo Ghoul will surely satisfy the craving. The soundtrack was awesome, no argument.",6
"
                For those who watched tokyo ghoul for the first time and haven't read the manga, this anime would be a amazing experience for those who are fans of horror animes like shiki, higurashi, another and etc to fill the empty space missing some good horror animes. But for those who readed the manga, it will have a more different though of the adaptation of Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul √A. When i first read the manga, the concept was very interesting(even if is not original), and i was hoping they could adapt it to the anime, to become one of the best animes of all
                  the time but unfortunally, thats not going to happen with tokyo ghoul(unless they make a remake like fullmetal alchemist). By the way, lets start and i will prove my point.
Story: 6/10
Well, the story itself is about Kaneki ken, a normal student that in a night, got attacked by a ghoul but managed to survive since the same ghoul that attacked him, died mysteriously. For save Kaneki, the doctors transplanted the ghoul's organs inside of kaneki, having him to become a hybrid human-ghoul, now he lives betweens the ghouls and humans trying to survive the world from the humans(that hunt ghouls) and other ghouls, without to know what to do. This is a little review of season 1's story, the reason i write it is because this may help to explain somethings more forward. With this kind of concept/story, you may agree with me that the story deserves a 6 but, i must say, a anime is kinda like a cake, all cakes are equals, what differ, is what you are going to put on it like chocolate, vanilla, strawberry etc. In other words, many anime can have similiar or even equal concepts, but there things that differ on tokyo ghoul, for example the concepts of morals about what is wrong and what is right(similiar to shiki, but is developed in a different way), who is the real monster if is the humans or the ghouls, everything you will find out in tokyo ghoul. The reason i gave it a 6 is simple, i personally liked the story of tokyo ghoul, what i hated is one of the most common problems of the animes that is: They rushed the anime in every ways. A lot of things got skipped(some are underdstandable) and others totally avoid. If the anime had 24 episodes would be very enough to explain a lot of things but no, nowdays, looks like animes with 12 episodes means ""SUCESS"" -w- i don't know if they do that to the anime for increases the popularity of the manga(in other words, if there missing informations in the anime, of course they will buy the manga for understand more about the story), but for be sincerity, is a great disappointment, principally for me, since i'm a great fan of horror animes. I could have been much better if they make the anime with patience and adaptating everything necessary for explain the events of the story. But unfortunally, thats not the case. All we can do is prey for a remake in the future.
Art: 8/10: Art is very good, kinda realistic with a lot of details in the eyes(principally the eyes of the ghouls) and the kagune aswell. Is really a fitting art style for a horror anime, since it have fits with the scenes where the vitcmins shows the expression of horror, rage, sad etc.What i don't like it are some bugs in the body and the constantly censorship in the anime. Tokyo ghoul is a bloody anime, so why they have to censor it?
Sound: 9/10
Probably the best thing in the anime. The OP really fits in everything about kaneki's fate and situations that he lives. The ED is okay, not memorable as the OP. Voice acting really fits in what the character is trying to express, also the themes aswell have that feeling of  dark, melancholics, depression that fits in the universe of tokyo ghoul, and some good instrumentals themes in battles. Overall, the sound is a amazing work.
Character: 5/10
Now, lets go to the part i personally don't like...ugh....characters. Well, what i can tell about it? the characters are very steoeotyped, you will see all type of characters that have in a dark atmosphere: The psychopath, the cannibal, the crybaby, the violent, the ""no cares"" about you, the crazy etc. All of them got their personalities totally explored that you will see them acting like their respective personality all the time and constantly that turns boring. There are few memorable characters on tokyo ghoul or even developed ones. Tohka is a little memorable, but you won't like her that much because she kinda acts like a bitch by the way she acts towards kaneki and there few development on her(more in the middle to the final). Kaneki got a good development, and is slighty memorable, he becomes a good character more near at the final but i was expectating more development on him since he will feel both sides of the world(human/ghoul) and many horrible things around. Hope in season 2, he have a proper develop.
Enjoyment: 5/10
For those who doesn't read the manga, is going to be a good anime, but for those who read, will be a anime rushed, full of unexplained things and a lot of missing information that would help to construct the story and develop the characters so...it depends of the taste, if you like horror, then you will enjoy this but i must say that there a lot of censorship. I advice you after you watch the anime, read the manga so you can understand what is going on and also understand many things that occur in the anime.
Overall: 6/10
For me, is a disappoint, a good manga turned into a rushed anime that had a high potential. There is already a second season of tokyo ghoul and soon i will write my first impressions of the episode 1 of second season. As i said, this anime is for people who like horror, if you don't like rushed animes that miss informations, then read the manga and don't watch it. If you really don't care if is rushed or no and like this kind of atmosphere of horror, go on and enjoy it. Even if you haven't read the manga, you will see what i'm talking about and how badly adapted and rushed the anime come.",6

                Tokyo Ghoul is amazing and my all time favourite.
Reasons why it is great:
1. It has emotional characters you can connect with and relate to.
2. It has an interesting storyline and it makes you feel sorry for the ghouls.
3. It shows what would happen if there was a situation like this in real life.4. It has a great art style and good character development.
5. It is a classic anime most people enjoy and although being a bit gory it is still enjoyable.",10
"
                It seems as though there are two people who watch(ed) Tokyo Ghoul, those that read the manga and those that have not, more specifically those who dislike it and those who do.
I originally wrote a long and boring explanation for all my scores but as I was taking a break in the shower complementing my conclusion I felt like this review should be shorter and basically just a conclusion...
First off, the anime is not bad, it is however utter shit compared to the manga but on its own and to people who have not read the manga it is actually good and most people will
                  enjoy it (which is why the majority of people rated this 8/10).   To be more specific, watch this (that is my approval) then move on to the manga from the very start so that its magnificence gets amplified and seems 100% better than intended since you are using the anime as reference.
Also if manga fans get mad, I get it, I would HATE it if a studio ruined Vagabond (my favorite manga) and would prob rate it much lower than what it deserves, which (lets face it) the other reviewers have done...",9
"
                After much procrastination, i have decided to do a review of my own about Tokyo Ghoul(Season 1). Before i start, everything that i will say is only my opinion. You can disagree with my opinion but please note that it is only my opinion so i would like you to at the very least, respect what i am about to say. Do note that i will be grading this as an ANIME standalone and will ignore the existence of the manga(which is better, imo).
==============================
For this review, i will grade the following categories according to a score, whereas the max possible score is 10, and the
                  least possible score is a 0.:
-Animation
-Audio And Voice
-Setting And Story With Character Development
-Pacing
*~BLANK~
*~BLANK~
*~BLANK~
------------------------------------------------
ANIMATION:
-Generally the animation of Tokyo Ghoul is decent, neither bad nor good. The character designs is straight and on-point and spots a somewhat Gothic look which really fits the theme of the anime.
The background of a few scenes also looks spectacularly drawn, with quite a huge focus on details.
However, when you get to the animation of the characters, that's when things gets somewhat inconsistent. Pierrot's style has always been simplistic which is neither bad nor good but one thing which i could not stand is the INCONSISTENCY of it. There would be a few frames in the anime where the characters looks deformed with faces that do not look human and such scenes are so BLATANTLY OBVIOUS that you would think Studio Pierrot did not check some of these scenes.
However, such scenes aren't the majority of what is in the anime. Most scenes are decently animated without much ""derpiness"". Close-up shots of the characters looks magnificent, with emotions and facial expressions done pretty well.
Medium to long range shots however, are bad and lack detail, with missing eyes, deformed faces, and etc. That happens when you look at a character from a distance. It's at the very least tolerable unlike a few ""derp"" scenes as mentioned previously.
My score 7/10.
--------------------------------------------------
AUDIO AND VOICE:
-If there's one thing that Tokyo Ghoul did really well in, it would be in this category. For starters, Tokyo Ghoul presented to us one of the best Openings of 2014, namely Unravel. Not only did Unravel sound nice, it also describes Kaneki, the main character's life and journey in Tokyo Ghoul with accuracy. Unravel is just such an impactful and meaningful song that really is a nice addition to the anime.
-To complement such a strong opening, the anime has also one of the best music tracks of the year. The music used in most, if not all scenes were REALLY in place to help stir up hype or emotion depending on the scene. Yutaka Yamada really shows his skills and talents of composing in the anime. However, despite wonderful soundtracks, one of the greatest flaw in Tokyo Ghoul is the REPETITION of some of these soundtracks. For example, Symphonie which is played in most battles, loses it's impact after you listen to it a couple of times, sometimes in the length of an episode and Symphonie is a dang good OST, it's just that it has been overused way too much in the anime.
-As for sound effects, the anime has quite decent sound effects for various scenes such as explosions scenes and the effects for the Kagune is also very well done. Overall, the sound effects is pleasing and contributes to the overall enjoyment of the anime.
-Voice acting is also another thing Tokyo Ghoul did extremely well in. All of the voice actors are extremely believable, and has a great tone and depth to it that really brings out the emotion of the characters vibrantly. Among the cast, i really found Hanae Natsuki(Kaneki's VA) to be the star over here. Throughout the anime, he was able to voice Kaneki's emotions really well, from being sad, to being scared, everything he said as Kaneki was downright believable and felt as if i was REALLY witnessing the scenes in the anime myself. He was also able to switch voices from ""Pus** Kaneki"" to ""Badass Kaneki"" really well.
My score:9.2/10
------------------------------------------------
SETTING AND STORY:
-Most people would simply call Tokyo Ghoul's setting ""another vampire setting"" and to some extent, they aren't wrong. Vampires drink blood to survive and Ghouls eat human flesh to survive. However, unlike vampires, Ghouls tend to eat more ""messy"", as eating human fresh is always more messy than simply drinking blood, and that is a big differentiation over here. So instead of calling the setting cliche, it would more preferable to call it ""A new take on a cliche setting"". What is SAD is that despite having such an interesting setting with multiple possible explorations on a few questions like ""Where did the ghouls come from"" or ""Why do normal knives not work on ghouls"", the anime decides NOT to venture and answer any of the questions which is a HUGE PITY as it would have given the anime more depth into it, to make it feel more lively and engaging.
-As for the plot, the first season of Tokyo Ghoul was incredibly CLICHE and PREDICTABLE, with your typical ""Weak Guy Turns SUPER OP"" kind of story that you would expect in many other animes of a similar genre. That doesn't mean it's a bad thing though. Despite being cliche and predictable, the psychological elements here and there are what really made the story at least half-decent. Combined with excellent voice acting, the plot of Tokyo Ghoul was decent but cliche and highly predictable until despite having severe pacing issues which i will will address later on.
-Character development wise, the only real development that any character had was Kaneki. In the anime, he was quite well developed, and easy for us to sympathize with him, especially after an extremely well done 12th episode that really gave his character some needed depth and personality.However, character development for side characters was severely butchered or hardly explored. A few good examples would be Rize and Juuzou which were really interesting side characters and i would like to know about their pasts, their personalities and their interests but they were hardly explored at all, which was once again a real pity, and i did not really care for them as much as Kaneki.
My Score:6/10
-------------------------------------------------
PACING:
-I am going to be honest over here, when i was an anime-only, i did not notice pacing issues till around episode 5 but i didn't think of it as a serious problem at that time. However, despite my own experiences, i have to criticize Tokyo Ghoul's garbage pacing, with events that escalate so quickly and so unnecessarily that you did not have enough time to digest new information and plot-lines of the episode. A good example would be episode 10 where the anime introduces more than 5 characters in a single episode, making it a clusterfuck. I am not even going to elaborate any further but 66 chapters+ in 12 episodes is WAY TOO MUCH. This is the main turnoff tokyo ghoul has and yet, it's one of the most important PART of the anime that Tokyo Ghoul failed hard in. I'm giving it a 3/10, and not a 0/10 only because some episodes had decent pacing, while the rest are bad.
My score:3/10
OVERALL: 6.3/10------SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE
RECOMMENDATION:Read the manga",6

                If you like horror ganre anime this is one of best animes to watch.
Tokyo Ghoul has such a unique and powerful story.When you're watching this you are enjoying every second bc there is always action..I couldn't stop watching it bc it was so interesting that i even forgot about time.Now to get on characterization.
You get one of the most extreme character developments that I’ve seen in an anime. It was done in such a way as to actually alter the overall feel of the second half of the series. Where the first had more of a whiff of the hopeful shounen fighting style anime, but
                  later became more reminiscent of the darkness.
Voice over work must have required a high level of emotional acting. The screams and anger have actually been a bit hard to get through sometimes.It left impression of good story.
Tokyo Ghoul is showing that it’s still possible to come up with something unique and powerful.
If you didn't watched it watch it!!",10

                 WARNING CLIFFHANGER FINAL EP if thats a deal breaker then run 
here's my advice if you read the plot and thought that will be interesting watch the 1st ep it sets the tone for the anime . if you don't like it fine,  but i think its well worth the watch 
i loved the story and would give it a 10 if it didn't have the plot holes , didn't ruin the anime for me but im giving it an       8
i think the art was great           9
                   
i believe the sound track was good and fit the feel of the anime             9
characters            9
(and here is why 9 for characters )the 2 lead characters are ken kaneki and all round good human being who would rather die than hurt anyone else …. Turned cannibal ,  toka kirishima a  teenage girl who wants to be normal but is forced to eat human, understandably shes not all sunshine a rainbows considering the whole world thinks she’s a monster when all she’s trying to do is survive, shes a pretty skilled fighter .Most the other characters are  kind of generic whether their good guys bad guys or somewhere in-between but they always have another side to them ( there are a few exceptions ). which gives most people a level of depth which a lot of anime  fail to do that so 9
if you want a anime that has a clear felling dread then this is a good choice .i mean you would have a feeling of dread if you woke up and you need to eat people ... or maybe not i don't know you . 
if you like the idea of being torn between 2 worlds  than you will like this one . The protagonist finds himself in a horrifying but unique situation .a human turned into a ghoul that has to eat humans to survive ,With no other options he turns to ghouls for help in keeping his humanity ,  even though humans see ghouls as  Evil monsters with unbeatable strength who indiscriminately kill humans to survive. Soon though he realizes that not all ghouls are monsters , some are just normal people who are trying to live their life’s a peacefully as possible . Whilst being hunted by humans who have unimaginable resources who indiscriminately kill ghouls in order to survive. (da ja vu I know right ) 
if your looking for horror this one does have death and tearing limbs (in that order sorry) a bit of pain not the best for gore but not bad 
if your into rainbows and puppy dogs GET THE HELL OFF THE INTERNET SAVE YOUR SELF 
all in all i liked this anime there are a few problems but no real deal breakers for me .",9

                This anime is what I call a true masterpiece.. Everything in toyko ghoul will either have you crying or have you gripping your pillows and grinding your teeth as you wait for the plot to unfold. Tokyo ghoul is pretty intense and and very sad, the main character goes through a lot and it's just out right fucked up what happens to him. This anime is very psychological so tread water carefully but in overall this anime is Fucking GOOD! The plot is twisted, the characters are very engaging, and the action in this anime is off the charts! All it have to say is
                  be ready to join in a wild ride as you watch anime, and try not to become a ghoul yourselfs.",10

                3 words to describe this series: Mysterious, Gore, Action-packed
Kaneki Ken survives a deadly encounter with Kamishiro Rize, a human-like creature that hunts and devours human flesh, known as Ghouls. Despite the survival, Kaneki discovers that he underwent a surgery that transformed him into a half-ghoul. He now has to learn to live his new life as a half-human/half-ghoul.
While the story setting resembles vampires and werewolves, it somehow feels different. Unlike many vampires/werewolves stories, Tokyo Ghoul explores good & evil from both sides – the humans & the ghouls. Humans can be bad, while ghouls can be kind-hearted. It’s impossible to label them or stand on
                  one side, and that’s exactly Kaneki’s dilemna most of the series, as he questions about his own identity while being an observer, and sometimes a participant, in many events. The animation is pretty good in the fighting scenes and the cinematography is beautiful – with dark & cold feeling to illustrate the world Tokyo Ghoul is in. Despite the great set-up, we think that the character development for Kaneki is a cliff-hanger in this season, honestly. But that’s also the reason why we are looking forward to Season Two, because we crave for more ass-kicking Kaneki.  
Good for: Those who love anime that’s a little dark & mysterious
Bad for: People looking for a fun & light-hearted series, or those who can’t stand seeing blood.",8
"
                Judging from what the plot itself sounds like, a lot of people have thought of this anime as an extremely hardcore horror or something similar to that. Let me tell you that it is not extreme hardcore horror and things like that. If I were to rate how horror-ish this anime is, it would be around a 3 or 4 out of 10. This is more of a tragedy anime.
The anime does have bloody and gory moments but most of the sites have those parts as censored, so if you want to watch all the arm/leg tearing, slicing, and so on action, then watch the
                  dvd. I will NOT recommend this to those who have stomach turning moments or something similar to that to those who cannot stand seeing or hearing the screaming from excessive pain and those types of ugly moments.
Overall, the anime itself is great to watch with great plots and suspense, but in comparison to the manga, the manga is more detailed where the anime would obviously have a few parts cut out from the manga, so try not to be too disappointed when you dont see your favorite part or something, but it should be okay. The artwork is really beautiful and the character drawings are elegant in my perspective in comparison to the manga. For those who like tragic scenes and conflicts with really good art, I highly recommend this.",10

                Tokyo Ghoul. This show intrigues me not because I think it's good, but because so many people do. Though there were parts that I admit I enjoyed, overall I can't call it anything but mediocre.
It's a shame, because the show had plenty of good material to work with. The idea of a character who has a foot in both the human and ghoul worlds sets the stage for a compelling story with insightful social commentary. Unfortunately, the show fails in its weak characters and reliance on cheap tricks instead of good writing.
First, the characters. Now, I did like a decent amount of the cast. Though
                  I wouldn't call them spectacular, they were generally entertaining enough. However, there were a few that were so over-the-top and/or unrealistic that it ruined the show. Tsukiyama was meant for comedic relief, but was nothing but creepy and annoying. Rize was likewise over-the-top and not believable. Investigator Mado was decent, but I found him to be unrealistic as a character. His backstory is insufficient to drive him to the blind hatred he has. He is a father after all, and there were certain scenes that were illogical and unconvincing. I also found the last actions of the main villain to be unrealistic and a convenient way for the author to get the effect he wants instead of a natural unfolding of events. Though the story attempted to create a dark, serious tone, I couldn't take it seriously because of its unrealistic characters.
The second issue I had was the gore. I'm not a big fan of gore, mainly because there is a temptation for authors to rely on shock value instead of good writing. This was the case here. Due to the unconvincing characters and illogical plot, the use of violence and gore was a cheap way to make the story seem mature, dark, and deep. For me, it had the opposite effect. Tokyo Ghoul was gory for the sake of being gory. It does makes it dark, but it also makes it extremely immature. Shock value cannot replace good writing, and it was disappointing that the creators fell to this trap.
This was a show of wasted potential. I'm baffled with the hype around it, and its generally high ratings. Watch it if you want to know what the hype is about, but in my opinion, you won't miss much if you pass it over.",5
"
                Well, first of all this anime is a very good one and that many people have watched and enjoyed. I've watched both seasons, but I will talk about the first one.
I don't intend to write a very long review since I don't like to and I don't like to read long ones so...
You all know what this is about there's the synopsis. 
The story I gave it an 8
Art a 7, nice fights, nice blood yet character designs felt a little insipid.
Sound (for me) was great like the soundtracks they used. 
Character this one is kind of a problem, because characters are not very well
                  developed but meh, they are fine in the long run do not interfere with useless stories.
Enjoyment was an 8 although I will say something about my enjoyment with the last ep.
Overall it was a good anime, great to watch some gore stuff and some nice, deep, dark story.
Now my only regret with this first season is that the MC is a plain idiot, who's not strong and pretty much it does nothing but whine in this first season (second is another story), but really in the anime the last episode (12), for me is the worst episode I've seen in an anime from this magnitude. It is boring as s*** nothing really happens, it is a waste of 23 minutes all the things they talked could've been done in 3 or 7 minutes, but the other is just a pointless conversation which follows to a cliffhanger. I gave it an 8 because of the start of the series and its mid-point, but I almost drop this anime because of the 12th episode.",8
"
                Sorry to say I have not yet read the manga, but eventually will. 
Even though it is quickly ran through by its manga counterpart, this anime is amazing. The very first episode caught me off guard as it was so grippingly gruesome and emotional. I love the idea of ghouls and humans. The way they perceive ghouls with a heart left me intrigued on the characters individual basis. Their bumpy traction with Kaneki not being able to accept what he has become has made it great with how he will end up dealing with it. Everything from the animation, to sound and progression, this anime
                  is up there with my most enjoyables. It never really let me feel that it was going to be dull and boring because the grip it had on terror and torture kept me wanting more. I enjoy a battle of a boy trying to accept what he could not control, where towards the end he made a grand decision that made me feel axceptional. Overall I rate this anime a 9 because of its form and attraction towards beauty and torture. I can't wait for the next season even though I heard the manga was ending. That tore me apart when I found out this was an amazing show.",9
"
                I guess I can understand why this has such a good reception. I was also excited the first time I came across a story whose main character is conflicted between the need to kill to survive and the will to retain his humanity, it is usually a very interesting plot line.
Sorry to disappoint you boys: this is not new ***in the slightest***,  e.g. Anne Rice made her name by writing about this very subject in 1974. The similarities between Tokyo Ghoul and the book/movie ""Interview with the Vampire"" are uncanny,  and though they are certainly not ""the same"", the **essence** and the message
                  of both stories is.
Casting the ""originality myth"" aside,  there is nothing much left for Tokyo Ghoul. It is just a regular anime with a boring cliché main character. The ""powers of the Ghouls"" are not even properly explained either, resulting in your standard dull action scenes:
-Ha, I'm more powerful than you!
-Nooooo, don't hurt her!
-Ha, I will kill her, you're weak and cannot defeat me!!
*screams for 15 seconds* 
-OMG w-what is... what is this power?!?!?!?!?!!?
-Ha, I'm more powerful than you!!!!!!!
- H-how... h-how could you defeat me!!!!!
I was honestly bored half way in and almost dropped the series. Someone told me to ""hold on it for the last two episodes"" and so did I. Things certainly got more interesting in some sense and my opinion about the anime did raise, though I am truly divided if it was worthy to brave through the 10 first episodes just for those last two.",5
"
                I know you can say an score of 10 is a bit too much ... but I think this anime is a MASTERPIECE!
STORY: 10/10
What can I say .... It is a beautiful, EPIC & sad story and the ending of this anime is just BADASS!
The PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS the anime entails often made me think about human prinicpals and a generall right to live (if you need to eat other humans it is kind of the same as us humans eating animals)
CHARACTERS: 10/10
Many are complaining about Kaneki being a wimp but I say: ""What would you do?! ...  you can really EMPATHIZE with Kaneki and
                  feel his pain.
I dont need another ""hero from the beginning""-story.
The character developement is really great and you have a big diversity of different character types so everyone finds someone he loves.
SOUND: 9/10 
The OPENING is the best anime OP I heard so far and I'll guess that won't change any time soon :P It is EPIC and evokes many feelings.
The OST is also very awesome. I really liked the different soundtracks because of their epicness and UNIQUENESS.
Although I didnt enjoy the ending so much it's still good ... it is just not as good as the op and soundtrack.
ART: 10/10
The art is really nice. Smooth animations, nice artstyle (colourfull but dark) and really great fighting scenes!
Seriously the fighting scenes are well conceived and will blow your mind! A symphony for your eyes.
ENJOYMENT: 10/10
I already told you how much I like the anime ... nothing left to say :P
OVERALL: 10/10
My favourite Anime! I recommend it to anyone who can stand a little blood and splatter (If u can't stand these things, don't think about watching the censored version .... its bad (in my honest opinion) and takes something special from this masterpiece)",10

                It starts simple. Kaneki Ken is an average quiet college freshman who loves reading books and hanging out with his only friend, Hide. The Tokyo they live in is going through a quiet chaos created by human- look-alike people called Ghouls, who live among humans but feed on their flesh. Kaneki doesn't have anyone--no family and only Hide for a friend--which probably makes him the perfect target because nobody will ask about this kid. When he goes on his first date with the girl he likes, he has no idea his life is about to change forever. It is after that night and after he
                  is attacked that Kaneki receives a transplant and becomes a half-Ghoul. He's been human all his life and now one of the basic needs for him to survive has become killing people and eating them. Ghouls cannot eat anything but human flesh; not only human food tastes horrible to them, but it also makes them ill. Ghouls are pretty much hunted by investigators in Tokyo, so Kaneki has to hide his new self, even from his one and only friend Hide. Hide is 'food' now, so what happens if Kaneki starves himself to insanity?
The story starts and expands as Kaneki struggles to keep his humanity through his encounter with different conflicting groups--Ghouls that cannibalize other Ghouls, those who kill humans and eat them more for enjoyment rather than need, humans that refuse to accept Ghouls are creatures capable of feeling as much as humans, humans who hunt Ghouls, and Ghouls that believe humans should all be destroyed. Slowly, the story turns into a character study: How far does it take for the innocent to break?
I started watching Tokyo Ghoul when I kept hearing the title here and there on the internet, and as you can imagine after the first episode I couldn't stop watching (I read the manga only after the series ended.) If you want an Attack on Titan kind of anime with a solid action plot, you might not like Tokyo Ghoul as much. Yes, it has some great action sequences and a lot (and I mean A LOT) of gore and violence-- especially the last two episodes are definitely not for the faint-hearted. But what makes the show especial is the characters. Kaneki is a great protagonist. He is 'real'. I've watched some series with the main character adapting to their new situation so unrealistically fast. Some might see Kaneki as weak for the way he struggles to become a real Ghoul or remain a real human, and how he's trapped between the two worlds without a place or anyone to go to. But those are features that make Kaneki a real, likable character, and make where the plot heads to so very sad, and equally satisfying.
Long story short: Watch Tokyo Ghoul if you love violent, psychological horror stories or/and if you love seeing some VERY good character development",9

                There will be some sections separated in 2 parts, this is because i have 2 different opinions in some of them. Those will be separated as ""As an adaptation"" as i will be reviewing it as a direct adaptation from the manga, and ""As an original"" just liked said, to me, this was more of an original series rather than a direct adaptation, so i will review it considering this is an original series.
STORY: 4
-Part 1 - As an adaptation (3/10)
Of all the things they could've done, they decided to not follow the story. While at the beginning it looked like a pretty good adaptation,
                  they lost that later in the series. To my eyes, it's just an original series made inspired by the manga. 
-Part 2 - As an original series (5/10)
The show is ok, obviously it needs a lot of work. It is fast paced for those who don't like that much dialogue, while at some points it's quite confusing since they don't focuse on telling us the meaning of things, you get the hang of it after some time.
ART: 4
The art is nothing from the other world, it's good most of the time, but sometimes it just stops being smooth and that's where the problems come. Most fights were not properly focused, so you could barely understand what was going on. The point i probably liked were how they did the Kagunes, they are straight up beautiful. 
Sound: 8
The music and voice acting in this is such a nice thing that a lot of shows are missing. The Opening is really nice and the Ending is just fabulous. The insert music was also really pleasing and it was put in the right places.
Character: 3
We get to know a lot of characters, like, a lot. But, unfortunately, none of them has proper development. To me, the 2 that got proper and nice development were Kaneki and Rize, all of the others were almost just like extras to actually make a story, they didn't really contribute in anything.
Enjoyment: 6
Part 1 - As an adaptation (5/10)
I liked this show, but at the same times i hated it, i read the manga before hand and they didn't follow everything from it, at the beginning it was going good but instantly went down and they clearly started a new story, or better said, they just wanted the fast way out. They did things way too quickly.
-Part 2 - As an original series (7/10)
The show is nice, but there are some things that could've been explained before anything, the way they ended it was also weird and bad, it just felt empty and dull after that fight, to just end it with kaneki eating? Ok.
Overall: 5",5

                The only thing I have to say is... what a disappointment. I only started watching Tokyo Ghoul because it is a very popular and well known anime, so I wanted to see it. Now that I've seen a few episodes of Tokyo Ghoul, I'm starting to wonder why it was so successful? (apart from people watching the anime because they read the manga) 
First off, I have only seen 5 episodes and I am currently watching the 6th episode. I just don't get what the hype is about. The animation is pretty low-grade even for an anime that came out in 2014. The characters, as
                  well as the plot are pretty boring, honestly. The concept of the story is interesting, but the execution is not. I feel that watching the rest of Tokyo Ghoul is going to be a waste of my time, but nevertheless, I will finish the entire series out of obligation since I started it. After I finish the entire show, I'll come back and reanalyze the show/edit my review, but for now, I don't recommend for anyone to watch this show just because it is popular. (Unless you want to, I dunno, whatever floats your boat)
*UPDATE*
I finished Tokyo Ghoul a few days ago, and I started Tokyo Ghoul √A. I still feel pretty much the same about the anime, it's pretty mediocre. The only thing I will say though, was that the last few episodes were slightly more interesting, but overall I still am disappointed with the show. Like I said before, if I were you, I wouldn't waste my time watching Tokyo Ghoul.",4
"
                For me this anime deserve a solid 8 at least. Each episode managed to keep me entertained and hyped. The concept of humanity and struggle to live as a ghoul or human remains its core subject. Ghouls can only consume human whilst human on the other hand try to fight back in a prey-predator relationship. The story focus on both parties (human and ghouls) and their struggle to live in this kind of twisted world. 
The ending for first season was kinda disappointing as it leave us a cliffhanger during the heat of the moment. I was hoping the second season will be as great
                  as this one.",9
"
                IN my opinen i think Tokyo Ghoul one of the best aimes that y most wath the anime it is barfikt  I give it 10/10 IN my openin of cours 
THE STORY : I love it ,new story and it is that kaind of stores that when y start it
y cant stop watching it.
THE Character : All I can say about  Ken Kaneki the best Seinen, main Character
at all time for me 
THE Art and Sound :Are beautiful  IF you didnot watch it what are you doing go and watch it no 
Tokyo has become a cruel and merciless city—a place where vicious creatures called “ghouls” exist alongside humans. The citizens of this once great metropolis live in constant fear of these bloodthirsty savages and their thirst for human flesh. However, the greatest threat these ghouls pose is their dangerous ability to masquerade as humans and blend in with society.
Based on the best-selling supernatural horror manga by Sui Ishida, Tokyo Ghoul follows Ken Kaneki, a shy, bookish college student, who is instantly drawn to Rize Kamishiro, an avid reader like himself. However, Rize is not exactly who she seems, and this unfortunate meeting pushes Kaneki into the dark depths of the ghouls' inhuman world. In a twist of fate, Kaneki is saved by the enigmatic waitress Touka Kirishima, and thus begins his new, secret life as a half-ghoul/half-human who must find a way to integrate into both societies.",10
"
                Tokyo Ghoul starts off introducing an alternate Tokyo where creatures called ghouls exists alongside humans. Imagine the most frail, antisocial bookworm you can think of. That is the basic description of Ken Kaneki on episode 1. After an encounter with a ghoul, Kaneki is left changed forever and living the life of a ghoul. Throughout these 12 episodes and 12 more in the next series, you watch this character turn into something completely different in the most drastic character change I have ever seen in anime. By the end of it you wouldn't even believe it was the same person you started with. The story
                  is quite amazing, the pacing is perfect, the music fits beautifully, the characters are intriguing. When I first watched this anime, I had very high expectations and I can honestly say it exceeded them all. When it comes to anime and manga, I usually stick to the anime as I'm not a big reader but once I finished the anime I had to buy the manga because I couldn't get enough of it. The series is so emotional and so thrilling, you will be glued to the screen watching it and every single episode will leave you in awe. Watching the transformation of Kaneki from a small, antisocial human into the badass ghoul he becomes is an incredible story and one of the most thrilling stories I've ever seen. Along with Kaneki are his friends and fellow ghouls, Toka, Yoshimura, Hinami and Nishiki as well as his best friend Hide. All of them have their demons and emotions and try to live alongside the humans. But in a world where the ghouls are seen only as creatures that deserve to die, a fine line is drawn that shows that humans and ghouls are not so different and only Kaneki knows the life of both. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who loves an outstanding story, great characters, and beautiful music.",10

                When you go out on a date, you always have to expect two things to happen. Eventually, sooner or later you are going to end up breaking up, or you are going to end up hooked up for life; these are just about the end of possibilities for most. What you don't expect is to avoid getting eaten, to have their organs surgically inserted into you, and for you to live out the rest of your days as a bloodthirsty vampire (I'd say ""ghoul"", but come on, the influences here are clearly more vampire-inspired).
I probably enjoyed this much more than I thought I would, considering
                  I'm no longer a teenager or ""edgy"", so I guess that suggests for the most part this anime is particularly well-made. The soundtrack is on point, the animation has clearly had some effort put in, and the Kagune/Quinque's make for a creative means for battles (not to mention a lot of gratuitous violence). A lot of fun so far, decent pulp entertainment. 7/10",7
"
                Keep in mind that this was a failed Youtube review that I wrote a while ago.
If you're thinking about watching this anime, I think we should start out with the misconceptions. You might have thought that this was a horror anime. There is a bit of blood, but there isn't anything scary about it. There's a fair bit of action, but the anime is mostly about discrimination. Another misconception you might have is thinking that the main character has white hair. He doesn't change to this form until the last five minutes of the series.
Now that we have that out of the way, let's talk
                  about what the series is about. The main character starts out as a normal human but surprise! He turns into a ghoul in the first episode. The main differences between humans and ghouls is that ghouls have weaponous arms that sprout from their back, regenerative abilities, and a very restricted diet. To elaborate on the latter, unlike herbivores and carnivores who can eat anything they feel like but are simply better at digesting plants or animals respectively, ghouls are unable to get any nutritional value from foods other than human flesh. Ghouls also appear to eat their food raw. The anime never says if they can get anything more out of cooked flesh than raw flesh, so it might just be a way to show the viewers that the ghouls aren't just eating steak. A single human has enough food to feed a ghoul for a month or two, but some ghouls, like cats, kill more than they can eat because murder is fun for them. Even though most ghouls kill only enough humans to survive and some ghouls rely exclusively on humans who are already dead, the vocal minority of serial killer ghouls spawned a team of people called “ghoul inspectors” whose job is to kill all of the ghouls. Because ghouls don't want to be killed they kill the ghoul inspectors which reinforces the stereotype of ghouls being evil. Ironically, the ghouls themselves are better at getting rid of the most dangerous ghouls whereas the ghoul inspectors mostly target the harmless ones. If you think that's a spoiler, there are hints that the binge eater was killed by another ghoul in the first episode.  
Now to talk about Kaneki’s one-eyedness. Kaneki became a one-eyed ghoul because he accidentally had Rize’s kakuhou implanted into his body. Because one-eyed ghouls are stronger than both humans and ghouls, I would think that they would be a good strategy for the humans. The ghoul inspectors already slaughter plenty of ghouls, so it would make sense for them to turn themselves into one-eyed ghouls and possibly even make a treaty between the humans and the ghouls, but I guess they must not know about this possibility. How they can consider themselves to be inspectors without any intention of learning anything about ghouls astonishes me. I think “ghoul exterminators” would be a more fitting name.
One thing that is quite interesting is the simple fact that ghouls still exist. Humans are brutal animals and I’m sure that if unicorns ever existed humans are the reason that they don’t anymore. People are also willing to push any species to extinction if that species happens to prey on humans. Ghouls must be a fairly new mutation from humans. Either that or they just hid their existence better in the past. If ghouls exist in other parts of the world I’m sure the ones in the United States don’t have to kill as often.
I thought this was an interesting series. If you were expecting to be scared, than you may be disappointed. If you were looking for some great action scenes than I think you will like this. I would also suggest this to anyone who feels oppressed, discriminated against, or otherwise under stress because of how others treat you. The quote “all white people are racist” explains theme pretty well. The members from both groups automatically judge the other group by the worst examples and don’t know much at all about the other side. I rate it 26 out of 31 eyepatches.",6

                Tokyo ghoul. 
Personally, I think this anime could've been one of my favourites. It frustrates me so much actually, because the plot is enjoyable, the characters suffer great tragedies, the art is good, the opening is amazing, the last episode is epic (in my  opinion). BUT, there are many things that just don't deliver. 
I havent read the manga yet, so i have no idea if these questions are answered in it, but this show is so confusing at times. Are we really supposed to know beforehand what the hell is a kagune?? And how did ghouls suddenly appear in tokyo?? And do they
                  only exist in tokyo? Also, how did the doves or whatever made those weapons to fight ghouls?? I mean it all feels very new, people don't seem to know much about them, but they managed to make special police forces against them and those weapon thingies? And if everything is so disgusting to them, why isn't coffe???? (and this isn't really a spoiler but you've been warned) Are we supposed to believe that nobody noticed that kaneki left school?? Like, ""oh i'm working on a coffeshop now, hope that's not a problem educational system!!""
Besides those important questions left unanswered, there's the pace matter. I'm not sure if i'm alone on this or not, but the anime felt way too fast paced for me. Don't get me wrong, I hate filler episodes, but everything happened so fast and it felt like they were trying to put everything in the manga in 12 episodes of 20 min each. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID. Seriously, I believe that if the anime was longer it would've improved so, so much.
Everything's kind of mashed together, and the last episode feels so out of context. Also, Kaneki should've had more time than just an episode to have that much of a character development, no matter how awesome it was, it felt rushed.
Another thing that isn't enjoyable inh this anime is the fact that the ""plot twists"" aren't really twists at all, you could see them all coming. 
But hey, don't get me wrong, i love this anime. In fact, i love it so much that it makes fume that it's true potencial isn't achieved. It really has so much potential to be epic.
The characters, for one. Even though it is a very fast paced anime, we can connect to the characters enough to the point of empathy, at least I did. From the first episode, I cared deeply about kaneki and what would happen to him, which made my heart break lots of times throughout the show. Hideyoshi Nagachika is my sunshine and I love him don't fight me on this. Tsukiyama though. He's that character that i hate but i love.
One thing that I love about these characters is that there isn't that one girl who is way too girly and always giggling and talking in an annoying high-pitched voice (the characters all match the dark vibe of the show)
THE LAST EPISODE. It is honestly so good it makes me mad that the rest of the show isn't like it. Seriously though, the whole show could've had that quality and character development, so why the hell did it not??
I really dislike anime openings. I mean, at the end of the show I've grown to love them, because they remind me of it, but i've never liked an anime opening from the first episode. Except this one. Unravel gives me the chills, it makes me want to cry, it's absolutely perfect. The soundtrack was overall pretty good.
I love the whole vibe of tokyo ghoul. I love dark animes, so it's no surprise that i was hooked on this one. It is very gory  though, so if that's an issue for you, I wouldn't reccomend it (there's a censored version available, either way). The whole plot revolves on tragedy and morbid themes such as torture and eating humans, which i find original and interesting (if it isn't interesting for you, i don't even know why you're reading the reviews).
Overall: I think everyone that likes horror, gory, kind of phsychological, dark anime should watch Tokyo ghoul. Even though I had that rant, it is a very enjoyable show and you will feel sympathy for the characters. I never get the urge to cry when watching anime, or feel like giggling and squealing over it, but this one does the trick. It is very morbid at times (which i like), and everyone knows that Kaneki is a member of the ""did nothing wrong"" squad, so if you're into that, i definately reccomend this anime.",7
"
                Story: a certain accident happens to the main character, which changes his life forever, so now he walks on a thin line, with humans on 1 side and ghouls on the other, and learns the truth between both sides.
Art: its amazing if you like gore anime. in some scenes there's so much blood, that the screen need to be inverted for censorship.
Sound: the opening and background music is outstanding, and very heart warming, even if you cant speak Japanese (just look up the lyrics is you don't believe me)
characters: the main cast is unforgettable, and proves to you that, not all ghouls are bad, and
                  just how human they are.
SPOILERS:
 watching this will written story,makes you as a human, think to join the ghouls, and kill other humans......just watch it for yourself and your understand.",10
"
                This is my first review, There are tiny spoilers.
The anime was good, I heard they skipped chapters I feel it was slow at first but got better, The only bad part I would say is when it took kaneki forever to become bad ass, And the fact the anime ended in twelve episodes, The anime definitely  needs another season because it was just leaving us at a cliff hanger at episode 12 where kaneki eats (SPOILER) Yamori, Overall I think it was a great anime.

                [I did not read the manga]
Tokyo Ghoul really was an awesome anime and it kept me captivated until the very end.
The gore and action aspect of this series was really what kept me hyped for watching it and kind of reminded me of other anime I have watched before (like Naruto and Deadman Wonderland).
The opening song is really cathy and well conceived, being well combined with the flow of the series.
Character-wise this series gives you a bit of everything: the badass female, the screwed up, the scared cat, the freak, the responsible leader, etc.
The story builds a really good plot from the very first episode
                  to the very last one, with every episode we know more about the Ghoul, Ghoul groups, and the police who are divided by areas as well as their intentions to one another.
Now for the main character you really don't see a big change on him until the last episode, he just adapts to the situation he is in and has that cliché behaviour: ""Why me? Why me? I don't wanna hurt or be hurt"" (kinda like in Deadman Wonderland).
In levels of enjoyment I would say that the action part makes up for it and is well balanced with the portion of building up the story and the characters themselves.
The only thing I could say I didn't like would be the lenght of the anime, the events seemed a bit pushed faster in the last episodes, some fights would become better if longer, or just certain events.
Overall this anime is really one of the best anime I have seen, in any category.",9
"
                Tokyo Ghoul, where humanity has a predator. It presents a great story of how a boys world is turned upside down and his attempt to adapt to his new life after being turned into a Ghoul himself. However, fans of the manga will see quite notable differences between the anime and the manga. Now don't get me wrong, this doesn't stem from the manga's story (Let's save the second season for another time) it's just different. A few scenes have changed, like Kaneki went straight home instead of meeting with Hide after leaving the hospital and how Kaneki's meeting with Ghoul Touka was under different
                  circumstances as well as many other differences as well as some parts cut out.
The art was amazing and their Kagune's were very colourful for monsters who eat human flesh. It was animated pretty great as well, however I'd recommend watching it uncensored as there is gore which they decide to censor with covering the entire screen with black which ruins the art at some points.  I didn't pay attention to the soundtrack other than the opening theme so I can't really say much about it.
Personally I loved the characters. It made us care a lot more about ghoul's than the human characters. We watched Kaneki befriend Hinami, a child ghoul who wanted to live normally. We see how far Touka goes to blend in with humanity and we even start to like Nishiki despite the fact he was antagonistic in the first few episodes.
Tokyo Ghoul is a great anime for those who are looking for something a bit gritty and dark. 8/10",8
"
                As someone who went into the manga after the 10th episode i can tell how manga readers got pissed at the anime. the anime simply left out a lot of small scenes and it ended with too many unfinished scenes but i feel like its not enough to fully drop the anime. Considering there will be a 2nd season coming out i really suggest that you go into this anime. Granted if you fully want to explore the story and those bits of gore and uncensored scenes that make Tokyo Ghoul stand out i would suggest go into the manga after giving the anime a
                  shot. After watching the anime than going into the manga it did let me appreciate the manga more and it filled the gaps that the anime left. So if you can stand the censorship and don't mind the little things this anime is going to be and incredible watch and anime you wont forget.",9
"
                Let's first have a look at how the anime introduces itself to us with the very first few episodes it has to offer. First off, kaneki (the main character) had himself in a situation against another ghoul that wants to devour him up, afterward, a random pipe fell on the ghoul which ended up killing the ghoul and somehow got kaneki to fuse with the ghoul and end up being a half-human half-ghoul creature. The whole anime then turns into a crying fest and the main character starts tearing up the whole episode with an edge-lord vibe where he lost control of himself and his
                  humanity which then resulted into him being corrupted. If you think this anime is good, you are probably below the age of 13 and think this anime is cool because the main character wears an eye patch and lost control of himself. The plot it self is done horribly as well, as most of the anime is dead and the amount of times Tokyo ghoul introduces random characters to focus on irrelevant characters instead of developing the main character is unbelievable. Your lie in April was better than this crap and that crap was more homosexual than James Charles.",3
"
                *Spoiler warning*
There aren't many anime that fall under the genre of Horror/Dark Fantasy. But the ones that do are usually at least partly successful in conveying a good story. Tokyo Ghoul is an interesting anime about a calm and reserved kid named Kaneki. Almost immediately into the show, he is forced into a horrible and traumatic new lifestyle that he cannot change. They spend the remainder of the show building up to his acceptance of what he is and his choice to take back control of his life. He ultimately realized that even though he is a monster, it does not mean he has to
                  be evil. He also realizes that his previous outlook on life was mortally flawed which is shown in  his mantra: ""It's better to be hurt than to hurt others"". Instead, he realized that if he wants to protect the people he cares about, he would have to hurt a lot of people.
Unfortunately, no amine is perfect and this is no exception. Like most anime, the devs tried to cover the as much of the manga as possible in very few episodes. Not only did they cram it all into 12 episodes, but they didn't even try to skip over trivial events that mean nothing to the story. If you know your going to get little screen time, why would you waste precious moments on things like ten minutes of watching him be brutally tortured?
As far as characters go I can say that the characters on TG each had their own unique personalities. Noting that hasn't been played out on other anime but it's not so hum-drum like most characters in anime or nowadays. There isn't much character development in the anime itself. They take moments here and there to explain small things as part of touka's backstory. However, since the very little character insight into touka amounts to nothing in the anime it, like the torture scenes, just ended up wasting time. I would have liked to see more early-on development, but apparently that doesn't happen until the second half of the manga.
Considering how the anime is supposed to be about powerful ghouls fighting the doves to survive, I was disappointed at how there was much less action than I thought there would be. I was also pretty upset that they ended the anime of his ""om nom nom imma eat u Jason"" line. The few fight scenes that were present seemed a little anti-climatic for my taste but they still were well animated and held to the integrity of the manga. 
Even though there wasn't a lot of character development or fighting, the anime still had a certain charm to it that can only be found in anime of a similar dark nature.",8
"
                I think Tokyo ghoul has a very interesting set up which is a coffee shop and the character development is great, a good example would be Kaneki Ken, theres twist of plot. Kaneki was just innocent and weak young boy then suddenly he became a ghoul. And what was good was that he was different from others, which makes him in the center of attraction. Almost every ghoul would like what is wrong with this ghoul. And for the very entertaining intriguing part was Kaneki being captured and tortured. You could actually see the huge change appearing in Kaneki. Now then Kaneki had became a
                  badass he does lots of things, Lots of amazing stuff. He gain great power heartless, cruel, merciless. Thats what I like about Kaneki. Then one of the part which I like and wish for it to develop is Touka and Kaneki, I assume Touka had some change in her after meeting Kaneki, Touka was a good character, she was the one that would actually keep entertaining us when Kaneki was in a black haired mode, then its kaneki white hair mode kept entertaining us. I would actually hope for some development for Kaneki and other character, that is the part which I kind of dislike. A huge obvious lack of development is Fight scenes, its mostly begin interrupted, incomplete, lack of action.Ayato and Kaneki. As Kaneki left to join Aogiri, the fight scene increased, not so bad but not too good? I guess. But what I like is the story, it really is well planned, the plot which increase enjoyment, Suspense. Lots of people says Manga is better than Anime, Anime is just shitty. ANIME is NOT SHITTY, its just inferior to the Manga. Manga was good because fight scene was not cut and it just goes on until it ends. But overall I guess Tokyo ghoul was good, it made it into my favourite anime. Kaneki x Touka. Fabulous!",10
"
                By far the best thing I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Every single moment and frame, from the sound design, to the art style, to the animation, tells and riveting, layered and dynamic story. 
The story is about the struggles of ghouls vs humans and about the multiple perspectives that this struggle entails. Humans represent the stoic and yet hypocritical side of the story with how they claim ghouls are immoral for killing and eating humans for the sake of their survival, yet humans do the same exact thing to ghouls in order to protect their own species through the work of the
                  detectives. Ghouls on the other hand display the very opposite side of the spectrum, with the unhinged and at time epicurean side of the story, they kill and eat sometimes for food and sometimes for sport and their own personal enjoyment. The main character lies in the middle of these two extremes and is an ex human turned into a ghoul, he has the battle with his own nature and fight to maintain balance for on one hand he still upholds the morality of his human side but is forced to engage with the ghouls and consume humans in order to survive due to his new ghoul nature. There are points where his ghoul nature gets the better of him and he relapses and falls into eating humans and almost killing the ones he cares about showing how this is not too dissimilar to the concept of ones base instincts acting against their morality and then falling into the temptation, ""the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak"" as you will. This culminates to the fight scenes where he has to literally fight the embodiments of both sides of the spectrum he is struggling with, both the hypocritical humankind, and the decadent ghoulkind. 
When it comes to the artwork the style can morph into many different schools of thought, in some scenes the architecture is brutalist representing the cold and desperate situation is in, however at other times the architecture is gothic and rustic, representing a more homely and safe experience, or even one of growth and development in the case of gothic. When the environment is destroyed it not only signals the presence of danger but the challenge of the ideology that is being upheld in the establishment. For example the main character, Ken is trapped into a large neoclassical building, this building represents the epicurean take of those that love to kill and eat humans for sport of characters such as Shu (a subtle nod with the architecture calling back the roman and greek decadence of the late roman empire with bacchanal festivals being common place). Ken then destroys the building showing his opposition to the establishment of the ghoul epicurean class due to his human morality. To top off all of this the animation is fluid and thrilling. 
Sound wise the show barely even needs a review, every single song in the show is a well known classic amongst the anime community, from its opening to its closing and all the background music which are not only great pieces of music in their own right, but also masterfully connect with the story and artwork to the point of it being tearfully good. 
When it comes to the characters of the show I do not want to delve too much into each and every single one but I would like to say that if you have any philosophical books under your belt you will enjoy every single one, each one represents different ideas and ideologies that combine and complement each other masterfully. 
Overall I would say this show definitely deserves a 10/10 and is by far my favorite anime of all time. I would recommend this anime to anyone I know and personally it has changed my life and the very way I view the world. Everyone should watch this at least once in their life.",10

                Tokyo Ghoul is a joy to watch only if you are able to handle the gore. I enjoyed watching this anime because of the plot and characterization. Other than that people also have to look forward to the complicated morality that comes with the transition from human to ghoul. It is an anime that brings a lot to the table and I find it thoroughly enjoyable. 
One downside of this anime is that it does nothing to explain how exactly ghouls came about to be which is a question I and many other have. Along with this most of the anime is spent following the
                  story of Kaneki Ken. And while it makes sense since he is the main character the anime had many other interesting characters that I would have liked to see explored more. 
The fights are awesome to watch and the animation is top notch so there are no worries about jerking movements that disrupt enjoyment. Another good point about the anime is the music. Unravel by TK is a song that helped make this anime as popular as it is and it went viral for a reason. The song is amazing and once you read the lyrics very thought provoking. 
This is an anime that I recommend to a lot of my friends and its something that I would say you should watch too.",8

                To be honest i loved the anime because im into stuff like this which is Action, Mystery, Drama, Horror, Supernatural, Psychological wise it keeps u on your seat to see whats ganna happen next. it also keeps you in different feeling wise for the characters wise I have a couple in the anime i like (Touka,Kaneki,Rize) and a for feeling wise would be is this person ganna be killed or is he/her ganna live to see another day etc. But no matter what the manga/anime is really good i have refer a couple people to watch this anime and i wanna thank all the people
                  who did this anime/manga and i hope there will be more to it then 12 episodes. thank you guys for a awesome anime",10

                                                          ""Depressing, but good""
This is a story about a boy who is changed into something he fears. He then has to learn how to live on the border between what he is used to and what he fears. 
The show is tremendously violent and gory, but not extraordinarily so in it's genre. It kind of falls into the Supersayan-problem of ever more powerful enemies
                  that can only be defeated by the main character after becoming stronger, but it varies enough (more so in the second season than the first). Despite the characters feeling all over the place in the first few episodes, there is a point to that and after two seasons I actually quite like how the character arcs turned out.
What makes this story for me is it's underlying themes. It's about the big subjects of life and death and love and hate, but it does so in a different way than I am used to. The show seems to ask by showing murder after murder, battle after battle, slaughter after slaughter: isn't this pointless? Every time it sets a character up to be violently taken apart it makes a point to say that that character had value and now he or she is no more. It makes the point of the show, despite it's extreme violence one of pacifism.
It is a tremendously depressing watch, but definitely something I haven't seen before and something I don't know if I should recommend. Watch this if: a. you like violent anime and just want to see the pictures, because it is well made and not focus on the plot or b. you like feeling like crap after binging on short episode after short episode.
PS I don't like the title songs, but I am sure many people disagree.",8

                  This anime could've been pretty decent, it really could have. However, it is apparent that this 12 episode anime its cramming way to much into it's story. And no, the audience shouldn't have to read to manga or literally research certain parts of the anime to be able to enjoy watching this. That's just unfair, especially if you are going into this 100% blind. I've never read the manga (well I glanced at it but that's it), so I'm strictly covering the anime.
   The story itself isn't the worst. There are a lot of things that raise questions, and that plain
                  don't make any sense. It does leave a lot to be desired, but it could have been worse.
   The art and sound we're fine, and I don't have much to say about it.
    Here is where the anime really gets on my nerves. The characters. The only character I kinda enjoyed in this whole ordeal was the main character, kanaki. Everyone may think he's a estrogen filled crybaby... and their not completely wrong. But I find in that situation it was kinda of a realistic reaction, you know now having to eat people to live. And he does get some development and a hell of a lot pain. Lots and lots of pain. But even after saying that, he could have cried one less time. Just one and I would be good. 
      But a decent main character isn't nearly enough to save this cast. Everyone kinda sucks. Touka isn't that bad as she gets some focus, although I personally don't like her. The rest of the cast, almost isn't worth talking about. Hide is kinda just a cliché best friend character who never has the chance to become something more. With Amon, his character's setup isn't that bad, but parts of his characters conflicts with each other. And protecting people from ghouls is one thing, but following a sadist who is well, sadistic is another. So why is amon cool with his partner just torturing any ghoul he comes across. This villains aren't that good. They try to make you sympathetic for one of them, but its a really stupid reason to make you feel sympathy for someone so irredeemable. Jason I actually found interesting, and I would actually enjoy learning more about his character and backstory. What kinda guy was he like before he became the man he was? What is he thinking while he's carrying out these terrible acts? To me, he is untapped potential.
       There are other characters, but they are either boring or just have such little focus they aren't even worth talking about. The show tries its best to have tragedy and to make you feel sympathy for the characters, but it falls on its face. Hard. The show might as well just shown a fake news broadcast telling you about bad things to happen to random, fake people. It would have the same effect! To those who watch this show... good luck remembering all the names!
      Overall, this anime isn't that good. It's plot is loaded with problems and its characters aren't good or even memorable. I cannot recommend this show.",4

                This is a spoiler free review of Tokyo Ghoul.
This show was marketed to me as similar to Parasyte, and as taking a while to develop. That being said, it is NOT a good show, and markedly different from Parasyte with the exception that there are humans and non humans. So lets get right into it:
Characters: The main characters of the show suck, plain and simple. The main character Kaneki is a whiny, clueless anime protagonist. He's pacifistic, sucks at everything he does and is oblivious. The secondary character Touka is bitchy, angsty, violent teenage tsundere.There is an older type mentor, a little girl that has
                  no survival instinct, a clueless best friend. All hallmarks of a perfectly average anime. However, one of the only positive things about the show is also here: one of the antagonists is a very good character. The investigator who is introduced in episode 2/3 is methodical, intelligent, obsessed and flawed. I mainly continued to watch the show due to his presence.
Audio/Visual: The intro/outro songs are pretty good. Audio cues are solid and silences don't feel awkward. Unfortunately the show has shit pacing so you're stuck listening to the audio try to fill empty spaces. The visual are good also. Action scenes are well animated and characters have good readability. (You won't be confusing one character with another)
Story: Weak and simple. It basically comes down to an us vs them story of humans and ghouls and the world not being enough for the both of them. Any twists are either painfully obvious or nonexistent. The story is let down by the cast of ""standard anime characters"" that decide to do stupid shit for no reason, act recklessly, have crazy motivations and just do random anime bullshit. (Minor spoiler here:) There is a showdown in a church between a few characters that is equal parts nonsensical and overblown. 
Overall: The show simply did not do much to hold the attention. Good visuals did nothing to distract from the garbage main character or the cliche side characters. Unless you're really hurting for some mediocre magical fighting skip this show.",5

Tokyo Ghoul
ha ha ha 
Sooooooooooooooooo before we start off this review you must be aware that I do not watch anime often. Ok good. Now I had already been spoiled of what happened in the mango before watching the series and when I started watching Tokyo Ghoul I was in a very emotionally unstable and depressive state physically, mentally and emotionally which made Tokyo Ghoul one of the best things to possibly watch at the time. The edgy and dark tone of the series felt somewhat relatable to me at the time and I felt alone. Also felt relatable whenever Kaneki and
                  Touka were together and there was some cute moment or whatever. I was in a very emotionally frustrated position in terms of relationships and it just hit me in the feels I guess. Either way ill probs re watch this at some point after I finished watching Gotham, The 100, Shameless, Orange is the New Black, Vikings, and pretty much every other series im trying to get through. I must say Tokyo Ghoul is probs made in perfection and was perfect for what I needed at the time. I think you will enjoy this series especially if you are edgy or something.",10

                (This review will contain minor spoilers)
If the creator of ""Coldsteel the hedgehog"" and ""Jeff the killer"" teamed up to make an anime this would be the embodiment of sin that resulted from that cringe filled coalition. 
Tokyo ghoul is pretty much a story about zombies with super powers. Our main character fuck wit crybaby protagonist number 287 is a normal human who's turned into a half vampire/zombie/ghoul after running into the undercover mental retard known as Rize.  
The story is pretty much parasite to a degree. it revolves around a main character coming to terms with the fact that they're half monster now. But
                  even if you like stories like parasite I'd recommend watching parasite again rather than this. 
Because unlike parasite tokyo ghoul is just pure edge...It uses shock-value to make you give a shit about its unlikable characters and that would be fine if any of them were interesting which they aren't aside from juuzou.
I'm just going to sum this up now because this review is getting too long.
Every conflict in the show feels forced and dull.
The support characters often fall flat on their face and the ones that don't never get enough screen time.
The episodes have a tendency to drag on with nothing of note happening.
The fights are uninspired attack spam festivals that fail to draw the eye.
And most of all the gore is pretty tame....",2
"
                nothing was wrong with it tbh. everyone getting all butthurt like ""oh my god kaneki was a total scared idiot who could barely fight and then magically becomes super powerful"". Dude that's what makes the anime amazing. The story line is worshiped by beyonce & tokyo ghoul posters are glued to the queens walls. Hyped for season 2. The anime made me cry and want to kill amon and so much emotions overcame me. Now i Want to be a ghoul. U  T A! he surpassed kaname kuran and zero kiryu adsfjuhfgjhasdk hes hot asfffffffff. anyway this anime is jesus. If any of yous
                  have not seen this anime, I highhhhly recommend it. werk",10
"
                Chiaroscuro. If an anime were ever to win Best Cinematography, then Tokyo Ghoul would win that Oscar. I immediately noticed the difference in lighting, shading, camera movement, etc. from other anime. Those moments when a character had a flashback to a halcyon scene, or when a character's eyes were opening after unconsciousness, the emergence of a ghoul's kagune from his or her body, the spouting of blood... For there is an art to that, as done, for example, by Quentin Tarantino in live-action film. The art was beautiful. The play of light and dark, the surreal contrast between human and ghoul, the transformations, the other
                  side of Kaneki -- all this comes together to produce just a stunning animation, a story of the dichotomy between human and ghoul and what good and evil truly means, or is hue given to show.
I write this review for both seasons. I hope that the third season comes out soon.
After seeing the first few episodes, I wasn't that enamored. Looked to be just an anime about humanlike creatures that feasted on humans with blood dominant and character development scarce. Was I wrong. I at first thought that the ghouls were obviously the bad guys, and that we humans were right in eliminating them from society.
But think about it from the ghoul's perspective. A ghoul is born with the desire to consume human flesh, and the inability to gain nutrition from anything else. What else can he or she do to survive than to kill and eat humans? And even so, some ghouls aren't even willing to go that far. On the outside, ghouls are human. They feel the same emotions, have their beloved ones, feel anger and sorrow and joy. And to the human, these ghouls are creatures that kill humans, and that can't happen. Which side is right? And then there's Kaneki, the half-human, half-ghoul who struggles to understand. When watching this anime, I was caught between both sides too. Kaneki, after interacting with ghouls in their daily lives, sees the human side to them. Of course there are ghouls who live on killing humans, and there are humans who devote their lives to killing ghouls. You see the perspectives of everybody. Like Death Note and Code Geass, Tokyo Ghoul presents penetrating moral questions.
The sound is emotive, poignant in every way. I only give it a 9 because it's not as majestic as that of FMAB or Code Geass. Opening theme ""unravel"" is a stark portrayal of the ghoul-human discrepancy, and the ending themes with their changing illustrations per episode show a calmer, more revealing side of the characters.
And the fighting. Each ghoul has a bodily weapon called a kagune, which takes on a form according to his or her personality. When two ghouls clash, their kagune fly, blood spatters, and the ghouls clash again and again in a flurry of emotion-driven blows and parries and dodges that defeats the eye. Compared to anime like Fairy Tail, in which many times the characters end battles through pure determination and force of power, the fight scenes are more elaborate and realistic here. And the ghoul hunters, they use weapons called quinques, which are kagune taken from the bodies of dead ghouls. You have the agency with its many members, each with a quinque, and you wonder about their fighting ability. Then there's the many ghouls who fight, each with their own motivations and capabilities, and Kaneki, who has a brilliant power development. If you're wondering why Kaneki has white hair in the opening theme, well, watch and find out.
I'll just say that if an anime makes you stay up to four in the morning, then it is damn good.",10

                Tokyo Ghoul was by far one of the best, if not the best, anime shows I have ever seen. I already can't wait for the second season
This is probably one of those animes that leave you on a cliffhanger, on the edge of your bed, and so on. It is very magical, and very well made, .. It probably relates to most of us and how we probably didn't fit in somewhere, or at times where, we could never say no. This animie had brought me on the verge of tears (at some parts), so I would also say that it is quite a heart-touching
                  story. It is also full of blood, gore and family troubles. Or comunity. I honestly can't describe how much I loved this animie in particuliar. I recommed it to people who enjoy adventure, being close to tears, ...
9/10",10

                - 0/10- A rare fail by concept series, of which the anime doesn’t even try and redeem. Intentionally ignores good characters (Amon, Hide, Rize) and focuses on the boring ones (Touka, everyone at the café, Uta, yeah most of the ghouls). Disregards what could have been awesome plotlines such as the potential for Kaneki to get in with the humans right away and have a ghoul, human team for the ghouls that need to eat a bullet or ten (interestingly this was to be the premise for the later Tokyo ghoul Re but remarkably even that had the ball and dropped it, again by forgetting
                  good characters and introducing an extra bland cast). An inferior production of a manga that was in sore need of a good anime to give it some life, just all round dire.
- Characters: 0/10 - I get it, ignore the intriguing characters and focus on the boring ones, give the Emo’s their chance to shine. Emo was done long before Tokyo ghoul came out, and it’s failed to convey their… er, charms. Virtually all people and ghouls are astonishingly monotonous, un-inspired stereotypes for characters as well, flush. Apart from Kaneki, no one goes though any development over an entire 12 episode session, we’re non better for knowing them, they could spend the rest of their lives working in the coffee shop and you wouldn’t notice their absence. Same with the police side, nothing original and like the ghouls it was clear from the outset that the least appealing characters would get the focus on them. Seriously, what is the point of any of these cliché, literally copy and paste wooden boards?
- Animation: 3/10 - Surprisingly bad, objectively speaking and from a technical standpoint the only thing that is notable is the fluid blood like kagunes which are aesthetically impressive, to the extent where it’s inspired other anime (Seraph of the end apparently used similar designs for the realistic blood) of which this has to be commended. A shame they couldn’t apply some effort to make up for the poor backgrounds, and the clear disdain the studio has for this series with its dodgy animation in places. It is even more unfortunate since this would have been a great chance to animate Tokyo city that would be neat. And an effort to resurrect a lifeless cast from the manga would be impressive too, but why bother, right studio? 
When it comes right down to it, a series can have the best animation imaginable, but it counts for nothing when it’s on top of a bedrock of crumbs like this anime. Even if the art were decent, who would ignore everything wrong with this series and go ooh look at the pretty art, isn’t Touka wearing some absurd rabbit mask so beautiful? Behold, the best animated scenes ever! Of an oil spill/blimp explosion/toilet eruption/Tokyo Ghoul manga.
- Sound: 4/10 - Yamori had an appropriate voice, Touka did as well, but again under average. Subbed should definitely be chosen over dubbed voices, but even then the voices fail to bring out the emotion or feelings of the text and drawn on paper characters. There is little to make them stand out, nothing to explore who they are. 
In both aspects though it’s hard to be positive, for example Kaneki’s voice during the lopping off toes scenes unfortunately didn’t work so well, they were supposed to be serious scenes, not laughable ones because of how ridiculous it sounded (especially compared to the sub), kind of awkward to say the least. 
Background music also doesn’t count for much, neither do the titular songs, though it appeals to the Emo audience who love the sound, like the beginning song (unravel) it was all rather cringe inducing for everyone else. Then again, Twilight has its fans, Tokyo ghoul has its fans, and there you go. As well as the titular songs, the background tracks for the whole series were forgettable, never a good thing in an anime, especially in this one which could have capitalised on appropriate sound effects to exemplify the tensions that were supposed to be present. Never mind, the only song that wasn’t dire was the ending one, though it cannot be enjoyed it because of the association with this Taco Bell squat result of an anime. Thanks Tokyo ghoul for putting people off something potentially good through your association with it.
- Enjoyment: 1/10 – 1 given for the cliff-hanger at the end, anything to make it register that this animes out to be as bad as it can, the fans appreciated it that’s for sure. And, splendidly it leads conveniently into the swamp of no returns that route A sequel is, thanks a bunch. The 1 was also because fans may appreciate the manga being animated, notably the kagunes, though with this result they still needn’t bother watching. Still a mercy point for trying, we have to be constructive. 
The studio has succeeded in bringing the authors story to life, in the sense it’s a filled to the brim catheter of an anime. For the points awarded for the animation and sound, these ultimately count for nothing since both go down with the ship that is the concept of Tokyo Ghoul. A series is doomed from the start when you’re making a cake with cement instead of eggs, locusts instead of sugar, and horse poo over icing made of chicken dribble. Deliberately choosing the bad characters, storylines and cliché avenues, and saying, “look mommy, look at the Tokyo ghoul I made in my diaper!” What do we do? Give it a gold star for trying? Sink time into those doctors are angry with this granny adverts; you’d get more fulfilment from those scams then this.
If you enjoy series where the worst imaginable storyline is followed (an office rom com between Amon and Akira anyone? No?) And it spirals off into an Emo fest, then by all means this is for you. Fans can drool over Uta, Touka and Kaneki’s Emo form - Kaneki’s still something, Tokyo ghoul can’t taint a decent character like him. Why invest anything in this anime, all the best, but don't be tricked into thinking this is good, this means as much to the viewer as it clearly meant to the studio that made it: nothing.
- Overall verdict: doesn’t warrant a rating/10 - even a ‘0’ is giving this animation version of B-movie some unwarranted credibility that it is not entitled to, and undeserved critique that should be reserved for something notable.",1

                Tokyo Ghoul is a show that tries to be good, but really fails. You know when you’re in your mom’s basement using discord on a run down potato, and suddenly you get a pop up of those weird “Date Me” ads. You realise you’ve got a virus right? So you go to YouTube to get rid of the virus because you’re a dumb bitch who doesn’t know what to do. On the YouTube video, you get a Kool-Aid ad. This is how Tokyo Ghoul made me feel. I’ll just get straight on onto what I want to talk about. The character designs were shitty as,
                  like what the fuck is Touka’s hairstyle. I’m sorry but what? At least, they did something good for Ayato. Another thing, Jason is so ugly. It’s like you took your face and went into photoshop to edit the photo until you can’t recognise it. So you stretch the face out and suddenly the FBI bursts in and you have to shut everything down and make a run for it. That’s what his face is. The show requires a lot of inferring to the point is not even inferring? Like please, the fuck tell me how ghouls are made? Like why coffee and water are the only foods humans and ghouls can enjoy together? Also how tf please teach me, I know you can actually do this, how do you throw up your food before “digesting it”. I’m legit racking my massive brain for anything good about this anime. Hide, that kinda good looking guy, is clueless. Literally clueless. I’m sorry, he doesn’t even question Kaneki’s eyepatch. Where’s his sympathy that his friend’s “date” got squished by a pillar or sum and then his friend almost bled out to death? And he doesn’t even seem like that good of a best friend to be really honest. Also who the hell took care of Kaneki after his mom died? Also where the hell is the missing character development? Like every time it tries to develop, it’s like the directors were like, 
“We’re on a budget, no time.” Honestly. Also this anime is speedy. The amount of content they packed in 12 episodes is way too much. Months pass before we realise it. It needs a good 24 episodes. Also the show isn’t even that gory as they don’t really show that much gore besides blood. Btw I’m confused, how did Kaneki’s hair turn white. Like it wasn’t even part of his “feel sorry for me” part with Rize in episode 12. Like his hair turned white actually, also where tf did he “magically” gain strength? This show makes me want to die and I have so many questions.",7
"
                I really, truly wanted to like this anime- it has a very cool premise and the first episode was great and really had me interested and eager to see more- but it really is all downhill from there with horrid pacing and story execution issues that simply cannot be ignored.
Art-
When it comes to the visual, and really the presentation as a whole, this anime earns high marks. It's a relatively new anime and the graphics are quite beautiful. There is a mindlessly large amount of blood- and don't get me wrong; I love a dark fantasy anime and some blood/gore/horror as much as anyone- but
                  this anime goes beyond over the top with it and just has absurd amounts of blood largely for the sake of it. Nevertheless, this anime is visually appealing and I'd give particular praise to the opening sequence which at times dips into the territory of visually breathtaking.
Sound-
Sound is also part of presentation as far as I'm concerned and like I mentioned above this anime earns high marks for its presentation as a whole. The voice acting here is very strong and features a cast of true professionals. The music is quite lovely and again I'd give particular praise to the opening sequence which has a great song worth adding to your playlist.
Character/Story-
The utter failure and ass-backwards portion of the show is in the decisions made with the story and characters. I've written my share of reviews in which I feel the anime would have been better with a higher episode count, which is to say an anime was 16 episodes and would have appreciated somewhere in the vicinity of 20 or perhaps an anime is 12 episodes and wanted 16-18. Fine. This anime has that problem to the most extreme extent I've ever seen. They tried to pack what must be, conservatively, 25+ episodes worth of content (and realistically I can see it being upwards of 30) into just 12 episodes and absolutely every part of the show suffers for this decision.
Character development is close to non-existent, the story itself is super rushed and convoluted and there basically ISN'T a story at all other than ""there are humans and there are ghouls and they don't play nice"" and the ending is super ultra mega rushed, cliche, severely lacking in conclusion and just wildly disappointing as a whole. The fate of the majority of the cast they've introduced and that you're supposed to care about is simply never revealed or even hinted at. They appear in the final episode or two in a dangerous situation and they're never seen again for better or worse. A genuinely interesting premise and a rock solid first episode that I was really into is largely wasted by the horrible execution that follows.
Enjoyment-
With how difficult it is to get into or care about the mega rushed plot, a lot of the potential enjoyment is lost. There are a number of ""mindless entertainment"" scenes in the form of super over the top, ultra bloody fights between ghouls or between a ghoul and a human, and they're fine distractions for a minute or two, but then you go back to the lack of character development and the rushed plot and it's just really difficult to care about anything that's happening. There are a couple of deaths of named characters that the anime wants you to be emotionally effected by but because the characters were so wildly underdeveloped, you won't be.
Overall-
There are rushed/cramped anime, there are super rushed/cramped anime and then there is Tokyo Ghoul. To simply say that Tokyo Ghoul is rushed/cramped is to say ""Giraffes are taller than humans""- yes, that's true, but it doesn't come close to conveying the magnitude of the statement. Tokyo Ghoul has an interesting base premise and a great first episode that are both damn near entirely ruined by stuffing what must be 25+ episodes worth of content into just 12 episodes.
+Visually beautiful
+Rock solid voice acting
+Cool and interesting premise that you haven't seen one thousand times before
+Pretty soundtrack that is well above average from start to finish
-THE most cramped/rushed anime I've ever seen in my entire life
-Utter lack of character development
-Plot that is very difficult to follow or care about with major pacing issues
-Extremely unsatisfying ending that falls into a plethora of cliches and leaves many questions unanswered
OBJECTIVE RATING- 4
PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 4.5-5

                So while this is a pretty controversial anime (mostly due to the second season in relation to the manga) I'm going to specify I'm writing this independently of that second season.
In short, I quite liked this entry to the Tokyo Ghoul world. The way they establish character, the morally grey, and the downright evil are quite interesting. Those who are the most twisted were usually victims of an institutionalized system of a sort. One of the Doves, and one of the Ghouls. Due to the facts of everyday life, and ""that's just the way it is"" constant victims and enemies are produced in a great
                  machine that churns them out endlessly.
While I can sometimes have a hard time getting into the flow of darker anime, I don't ever feel like Tokyo Ghoul ever lied to me about what kind of series it was. It was one of pain and suffering used to make one either stronger or weaker in almost an instant.
Overall, it seems that they can provide the substance and style of the series. However, I think they do lack in showing proper motivation for characters sometimes. It either comes as some reveal, or it's too nebulous to get a good grasp on it. It was only in the final episode that it really started losing me a little, however it was nothing that was out of the ordinary for many shows I watch. If you like some dark gothic tones, you might enjoy this show. If not, steer clear.",7

                Tokyo Ghoul is a good seinen anime. The first season was wonderful it had good character development, a good protagist and a decent antagonist, it also had decent pacing.
I am one of the people who enjoy season two ,even tho it does have a lot of problems. Kaneki continues to become edgier every episode, there is a lot of subplots and characters that lead to nothing, but that final arc and the cochlea facility invade was amazing, and those alone single handedly saved season 2 for me.Tokyo Ghoul is also an anime that gets progressively worse with every season, the first one was great ,then
                  it all went downhill for them [even tho I like season 2 it was  pretty boring and bad season overall] Season 3 and 4 were complete and utter dogshit for me.I didn't like the characters, the pacing was definitely off, and the two seasons were just terrible, a lot of characters were misused like ETO, Arima and his subordinate the pink haired girl, plus the main villain Kichimura Washuu was very underwhelming.He didn't really have a backstory behind him, and he lost pretty easily, The CCG members character development got more and more worse actually ,it was actually almost nonexistent. For season three the Quinx squad was extremely annoying for me, and that one guy who was obsessed with Mutsuki was also just there, he didn't really have a purpose to exist, the final arch of season three was also hella weak. My final verdict for Tokyo Ghoul is a 5/10 a decent enough anime for the first seasons, but gets progressively worse from then on.",5

                I will admit that Tokyo ghoul is an, what you call, edgy anime with dialog that make you cringe and character designs that are straight up from edge town but I still enjoy it for what it is. The main character's transformation from everyday nerd to badass man-eater is what an anime like this should have. The secondary characters are also pretty awesome and memorable in their on way, both in the ghoul side and the human side. 
Even if I enjoyed the anime, I still think it is disappointing compared to the manga, especially the ENDING, which is an anime original... I mean why?

                Tokyo Ghoul was another anime about how humans and another species, which feeds with human meat, deals with each other. It was kinda like trend in 2010s. 
Story: 3/10
Kaneki, a regular human becomes ghoul through an organ transplant. Ghouls can only eat humans and drink coffee. Through the story, we see Kaneki's journey of joining the society as ghoul. However, it soon became clear that this is an action horror anime, so there were a lot of fights. What I wanted were answers: 
How did ghouls come to being?
How long have ghouls existed?
We don't know much about ghoul history, and we're supposed to understand them?
                  How can I? They are just a cannibalistic creatures to me then. 
Story also ended on cliffhanger, why?
Art: 4/10
Instead of adapting something like Shonen jump manga, which they are famous for, Studio Pierrot tried something called seinen. 
I hated how edgy it was, blood everywhere, dark theme...jeez I hate edginess like that. Animation overall could have been done better. 
Sound: 5/10 
Am I the only one who doesn't like Unravel? Everyone talks Unravel great, Unravel unskipable opening etc. 
I just can't enjoy it. 
Japanese voice acting was done well. 
Character: 4/10 
Protagonist Ken Kaneki is an average nerdy bookworm. Other than that, Kaneki didn't have any traits which made him likeable. 
Side characters, on the other hand were very interesting, I wish one of them was protagonist instead of Kaneki. 
Enjoyment: 2/10 
I can't come up with any reason why I enjoyed this anime. I just can't. 
Overall: 3/10
Sorry CaptainGiri. I know this is your favorite anime. 
Sorry if there are any grammar mistakes.",3

                I think this show is overrated, I watched seriously but it was just alright.
First the storyline was good, it was unique and the built up of it was so good. And that's why after watching it, it's not worth the hype. 
This anime is like they try to emphasize to the horror and kill, but I think it should not, it have a good start like SnK but they just ruined it.
But since it mostly about horror it was good for those who seek it, the art and sound are pretty great, some scene are stimulant too.
However the things I don't like the most was
                  the characters, they're being too dreadful, bleak, dark... It's like they're all about violent and such, no story's lesson or meaning at all, well they're some but they're not good enough
Anyway, that's my thought of this anime, it was overrated and it's a waste of a great story.",7

                Tokyo Ghoul focuses on a college student named Kaneki who winds up being attacked by a ghoul and infused with said ghoul's internal organs to save his life, resulting in him becoming a half-ghoul. In this series, ghouls are somewhat like zombies in that they need to eat human flesh to sustain themselves yet retain their intelligence, have superhuman attributes, regeneration and have an organ called a kagune that they use to slay their prey or fend off against enemy ghouls. Much of the series revolves around Kaneki adjusting to his new life as a ghoul, meeting up with the residents of Anteiku and coming
                  across enemy threats that either desire to eat him due to his unique origins or terminate ghouls all together. The series is divided up into several arcs as the series mixes focus between exploring Kaneki's developments and the world of ghouls. Tokyo Ghoul portrays the ghoul situation as an ongoing problem affecting the human populace, the residents of Anteiku desiring to still cohabit with humans despite their ghoul origins and other ghouls that clearly relish in eating human prey. There is a good amount of depth on the varying factions within the series that have their reasons for what they are doing and a number of the characters among them also get time devoted to them, with the series exploring how a number of the ghouls connected to Anteiku try living their lives normally and how those among the human ghoul hunters were affected by the more bloodythirsty ghouls.
Praises aside, the series still carries some issues that keep me from wanting to grade it higher. Kaneki's angst fits from adjusting to his lifestyle as a ghoul can be grating at points and there are some characters that are fairly shallow in their characterization compared to others like Oomori and those involved with Aogiri Tree. The final arc of the series also looks fairly rushed as the series concludes at a rather major point in the series for Kaneki's character development that leaves things in a bit of a cliffhanger with his character and the fates of all the factions involved in the conflict with Aogiri Tree were left unclear. Giving the series one final episode to properly resolve things with Aogiri Tree would have given it a more smoother stopping point for the series, though seems a bit odd for Tokyo Ghoul to stop here as its manga source material concluded fairly recently as of this review and the TV anime stops just within the middle of the manga's run. Also, do be warned this series is rather gory with graphic violent acts involving the ghoul hunters and ghouls as they kill one another or other humans. If you're not a fan of graphic violence in your anime, best not try to even watch this.
Visually, Tokyo Ghoul is one of the better looking titles I've seen for the year thus far sporting dark and subdued color tones that are a nice fit for the dark, suspenseful mood given off by the series with detailed scenery shots and character designs. Movement within the series is fluid for the most part as there weren't any noticeable instances of shortcuts or degradation of animated detail I noticed, with action scenes involving the kagune of ghouls being used making for the visual highlights of the series for me.
Overall, Tokyo Ghoul is a solid horror title offering a good deal of depth into life as a ghoul, elements to the world of the series and Kaneki coming to grips with living as one. Some aspects of its characterization are shallow or grating and it lacks a conclusive ending. But despite these gripes, the series was still an engaging watch for me throughout its 12-episode run and is worth checking out if you're a horror anime fan.",7

                Introduction
First and foremost horror in anime is a horrible (hah!) genre. Showing as much blood as possible doesn't qualify as horror, it's straight up splatter and gore.
Tokyo Ghoul uses a dark and eerie theme, but is far off from being a horror show. It's a typical action and drama anime and focuses on either ghouls and humans struggling to live a peaceful life together. Ghouls are humane-looking, yet driven by their hunger for human flesh and hidden powers in strength, agility or vitality.
Plot and pace
The story revolves around Ken Kaneki, a somewhat shut-in and introvert student becoming a ""half-ghoul"" after a certain incident and the
                  following struggle to fit in either world. He realizes that ghouls are way more present than he thought they'd be and are having their own social and cultural lifes.
It's always hard to maintain a healthy pace of plot progression when it comes to shows in which the main character who has to adapt to rather disagreeable sitatuations, while still driving towards a wrap-up and solution. Tokyo Ghoul fight's with having a way to big and explorable world, too many characters and too less episodes to make the audience feel immersed into it.
At the beginning you really can feel for Kaneki, but it's only temporary, because the show loses it's way in the middle and get's caught up in important plot points, with way to less time running on the clock.
Characters
One of Tokyo Ghoul strentghs are its characters. It's easy to like and hate them as they are very outstanding and designed to fit in their role or a certain theme. Perverted high-society gourmet, ripped masochistic asshole, etc.
It's very easy and exciting to comprehend on their lives and actions.
Animation and Art
This anime manages to emphasize with the help of the animation and settings the fact that ghouls live, outside their ghoul lifes, a pretty normal life, while, in scenes where it's appropriate, creates a big contrast between the ""normal"" and ""ghoul-filled underground"" tokyo. The animations and transmassions are seemless and one of the positive aspects of thie show.
Music
As typical the music is used to underline certain situations, drama, action, hype. The Soundtracks used are mostly fitting but some are very hard to distinguish from each other while some are very very outstanding. 
The opening theme and video are spoilerfree and fitting, and get's the most out of it in episode 12.
Conclusio
Tokyo Ghoul was a typical action anime in many senses. Main character struggles, get's supernatural power, overcomes struggle, struggles more. Struggle Struggle Struggle ... Fight Fight Fight ... 
While it is very exciting to immerse in the life of the ghouls, there is only little time used for that, thanks for that way to low amount of episodes, it was still a pleasant and sometimes overwhelming and emotional watch.
Tokyo Ghoul is must watch for action fans, horror fans should reconsider on watching it as a horror show, as the show is not anything near terrifying.",8
"
                Imagine a painter so lacking in skill and creative vision that his idea of art is to reproduce a single square-inch section from each the world's most renowned paintings as half-ass doodles and proceed to aimlessly slap them all together onto one big canvas. A vacuous and offensively derivative frankenstein of every popular anime you've ever seen: Tokyo Ghoul.

                Instead of a review, I'm going to go over my thoughts on the 4 major complaints I've heard about this show; censorship, incomplete/unfaithful adaptation, pacing was too fast, and an annoying main character. The censorship when this show came out was outright awful, and at the time it definitely hampered my enjoyment. But it didn't take too long for the uncensored episodes to come out, which is how I watched and judged it. I feel like the first impressions of this show led people to be prematurely turned off and to generate their negative bias against it. As for it being an incomplete adaptation, I
                  have no ground to argue as I have never read the manga, but as a stand alone piece its story wasn't bad, it wasn't great but it was good for what it was. The pacing is the hard part for me to talk about, because I generally like when the plot moves fast in a show, I like feeling like progress was made. I am too biased on this point to give a fair opinion on this as my bias led me to think that Black Bullet and Gokuko no Brynhildr were decent, to which my friends scoff and complain about how they were one of the worst shows they've watched due to how rushed they felt. To me the pace felt comfortable, but to each their own. Lastly we must touch upon Kaneki. Personally I like characters like him who struggle to accept the circumstances thrown upon them, characters like Simon from Gurren Lagaan or Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion are perfect examples of this. It makes them feel more like real people, and seeing how the deal/fail to deal with the problems in front of them is entertaining to me.",8
"
                Tokyo Ghoul.... In many ways this show is Beautiful yet also ugly, elegant yet also messy.
Now I'm not going to lie looking back / re-watching this show today won't be as enjoying as watching it back in 2014 when it aired, so I suppose a bit of nostalgia goes into my review aswell. 
The fact is this Anime is by no means 10/10, so why do I rate it so? Because the enjoyment I received from this anime was 10/10. While you might argue that the story was rushed, characters were unmemorable or the art style wasn't for you, what I can say is that
                  all those thing were executed perfectly from my point of view. To this day Tokyo Ghoul has remained one of my most memorable anime's of all time, the reasoning behind that is I enjoyed the anime to the point that I was obsessed with the world of this anime and it's characters, something I can only say for a select few anime. The point is that the world of the show was engaging so much so that I was able to overlook any ugly and messy problems with the anime and focus solely on the beautiful and elegant aspect.
The ugly / messy parts of the show would definitely have to be the pacing and character development, which in my case was easily overlooked. The idea that they killed off someone we hardly knew / developed a relationship with just screamed bad pacing and character development to me and is a really good example as to why I can see peoples hate / dislike towards this anime. As for me though I thought that coming to a conclusion based just off one example was a bit overkill, the underlying truth is that the show shouldn't be based off of one or two rushed characters, which is a given considering they were on a strict time budget and only had twelve episodes to adapt sixty one?, or something chapters.
Instead of looking at those negatives I looked at the positives, the soundtrack, animation, art and story. While it does have a more condensed story than the manga, it's certainly still an amazing story worthy of a 10/10 score in my opinion. It continues to astound me how so many people bash on the characters as if everyone of them was bad, from my perspective it was only a few that had bad character development and subsequently pacing out of the bunch. Something that I think most people can relate to is how amazing the soundtrack, (notably the first OP and the song ""Glassy Sky"" I think at the end of S1) the superb opening and endings just fill the room with joy and excitement whenever I listen to them / or re-watch Tokyo Ghoul. The animation is average to above average but I don't really have a keen-eye for things like animation, as far as I can see the animation was fine maybe even excellent.
That being said my personal score is 9.5 - 10 / 10 it really is one of my favorite anime's to date and I always get a nice feeling when re-watching or remembering Tokyo Ghoul, I would recommend this to anyone that has time to kill.",10
"
                Sometimes a paragraph or even an essay of words cannot fully capture why an anime is so good or bad. It is probably even harder for a person to convey to another person why the anime resonate so well with his being or why it disgust them so. This is because everyone has their own opinion and are entitled to theirs.
Ultimately, it takes a person to watch the anime to see if they actually like it, hate it, enjoy it or not.
***********
In this review, I will not be describing the plot or content of the anime like other reviews. I will tell you how I
                  feel about the anime and what about me that makes me like it.
***********
I occasionally enjoy an anime that dives deeper into the human emotion and psychology. But sololy focusing on that is not enough. There has to be action, comedy, tragedy for me to fully capture my attention and invest my time in watching it. Tokyo Ghoul is one of the few animes that delivers such a story for me.
While there are part of the anime that I didn't like, there were alot of find enjoyable and entertaining. There were some that left me feeling sad, some that i thought were messed up, and some that made me laugh.
If you want to watch an anime that is more than just mindless entertainment of superpower or bouncing boobs and vibrant panties, an anime that is a bit on the darker side but still provides you with you some comedy, meaningful relationship between character, then i would strongly recommend it for you.
PS. If you like my review or hate it, send me a message of appreciation or criticism. I readily accept both, since i already put my time in writing this after rewatching tokyo ghoul. Thanks for reading my extensive review! Luls.",9

                Story 7/10
Ken Kaneki is a quiet young man who loves reading when he discovers that the girl of his dreams Rize Kamishiro also loves reading and takes him on a date he starts to believe that his life is changing for the better but unfortunately Rize is a ghoul who has lured him into a trap on the verge of death Ken is only saved by a freak accident which kills Rize. However Ken requires an organ transplant urgently and doctors make the decision to use Rize’s organs which ends up turning Ken into a half ghoul.
Ken is stuck in a terrible situation where he
                  is craving human flesh but he wishes to remain human this leads to a journey where Ken has to learn more about himself and the ghouls that are now his comrades as someone who previously hated ghouls he realises that things aren’t as simple as he thought.
Art 8/10
Brilliant gritty art style perfectly fitting the characters and theme of the show.
Sound 8/10
Brilliant OP that is truly one of the best parts of the show I also thought the sound and voice acting was of a high quality.
Characters 7/10
Ken is a complex character clearly struggling with the transformation in his body but he is also a whiny character who takes forever to realise that he is no longer the person that he once was and if he and his friends are to survive he will have to embrace the ghoul that he is now.
There are some really good characters here with some  you want to cheer on and others both ghouls and humans being truly evil characters that you want to see get their comeuppance. 
Enjoyment 8/10
Entertaining show with a lot of drama and tension that also has some big moments and some genuinely good fight scenes.
Overall 8/10",8

                some spoilers, not too explicit tho
straight off the bat lemme just say if youre up for exaggerated homosexual innuendos then this anime is definitely for you. not that i'm against homosexuals but the way homosexuality is interpreted in this anime is a bit too vulgar... 'cause homosexuals are normal people with different opinions.
(honestly, you''l find yourself thinking, he's gay, he's gay, he's gay.. i mean the author was stuck deciding whether he/she should make kaneki gay -if youre tryna say that ghouls and humans have existed since before time then it's only natural that you'd have different sexual preferences as well)
sorry 'bout that; there are
                  two races in this world (but they only focus on japan... ""i be like, whaaaat?"" but it makes sense about why they did that since this is anime)
its episodes dont have fluid continuation, so from one episode to another you may think to yourself 'what's goin' on, i didnt leave off here'
the anime was also inconsistent with the protagonist's role
-
-
spoiler alert
-
kaneki ""please don't make me a murderer""
then he went off and joined one of biggest threats to tokyo... ""aogiri""
his motives consistently remain unclear and though he doesn't murder, he doesn't mind aogiri doing the murdering.
-
oopsy, 'nother spoiler... actually its probably in its sypnosis
it follows kaneki ken, a human turned ghoul (after a horrific accident). he has the body of a human with the organs of a ghoul. 
now this is a fantasy, it can have aspects of the supernatural which we cannot judge; but to a certain extent realism should be kept... the author, however, failed to do this.
it simply cannot make sense as to why kaneki can't eat human food (apparently to a ghoul human food tastes disgusting) just 'cause he has organs of a ghoul didn't mean his tongue was transplanted, rize (the killer) didn't even go for his tongue, her kagune (a ghouls arsenal) only pierced his abdominal area. it would've made more sense if kaneki was an individual who can survive for a bit through normal food but he cannot resist the urge of flesh after some time
-
the anime itself does generate some emotion but the best thing going for it was the sound track of season 1.
the action scenes were great; i can say that indefinitely since i found myself taking screenshots for reference. its story line did make me think ""why, please see that they can coexist""
and that particular notion is what i believe is the driving force of this anime; but being a seinen it means that everything will not remain hunky dory (<- haha i was able to use this word) 
art wise, this anime wasn't amongst the best i've seen, it was similar to naruto shippuden (my favourite) and that was probably because of studio pierrot (kudos to them). they ain't the greatest but they know how to tell a story.
the story remains in an infinite grey state where the lines between good and evil are blurred; it'd have been better for it to remain that but it had already been outlined that the driving force is for coexistence; of which the ghouls (not so much ghouls as it is ghoul; kaneki ken) are trying to create.
other than that, the use of distinctive characters had constantly captivated each character had their own dreams but at the same time shared a common goal (peace for ghouls). this distinctiveness meant that you will take to a character quite easily and you'd wanna know more about them; i constantly went onto wikia to just read up on characters ('cause for some reason i consciously enjoy spoilers -whereas the human mind subconsciously loves spoilers)
I can't say i enjoyed it so much 'cause at some points i was like ""hurry, hurry, hurry...""
so for a review i think it would be overall 7 considering all components (my list might say different but that's 'cause i gotta keep my scoring in proportion to other anime and its genre)
The story is popular, but in my opinion it was a bit too hyped; sure i can see why its more popular than naruto but i could never rate anything more than naruto since its so relevant to my life (so no messages to me that say, ""what do you know, you rated naruto 10"")
the sound was really similar to naruto and its best sound was the track of the first season
so in summary this is an hate it/love it anime which depends entirely on your tastes",7
"
                This show was one of the shows for me that had a big score change. 
I first watched this show when I first started anime probably around my fifty shows seen or more and I did not read the manga at all so I had no idea what to except but since it had horror in the genres I was like ""Oh boy where is this gonna go"" and I enjoyed it but then came the second season and that ruined it for me mainly. Then after I finished it I was just in complete disbelief of what I say so I decided to read
                  the whole manga first manga and I really came to really enjoy it all over again and get the full story. 
To me this show set a whole new scale for the horror and psychological genres cause throughout all of the other horror psychological shows I have seen none of the shows came close to my joy from watching and reading Tokyo Ghoul. (I still enjoyed the other horror and psychological shows FYI ;p) The story of this really had a feeling of just amazement and none of the other shows somewhat like this didn't come close to comparing. The art was really good and it felt good seeing how much work was put into this. (including the manga) The characters were well done and I thought that a lot of characters can go through many personality changes, but not as many as Kaneki has and I really enjoyed seeing him go through so many changes and feelings as well as hair color changes. It was a really well done character made to suit this type of show. Sui Ishida really did a amazing job and Studio Pierrot did a fantastic job animating this. 
I really look forward to Ishida's new work and I hope Pierrot and animate it again.",10

                *Spoiler free review: 
My, my, what a huge mess.
I will start with what I've liked. I consider my overall rating 4/10 to actually be very high, considering the garbage I have just watched, so let me be clear: Those 4 are solely for the anime art and the music. The art was outstanding, and the music was very good. And to be honest, it was very engaging and sometimes intense.
Everything about the series is a mess. I have not read the manga, but I have heard it's the worst adaptation ever. My judgement is based on the anime alone.
TL;DR --> The anime:
1. Lacks a definite
                  plot.
2. Is full of plot holes
3. Ill/No character development whatsoever.
4. No explanation at all.
5. The anime follows a certain pace then, at the last few episodes, they introduce us to not less than 10 characters, and make a dramatic mess. 
___________
Full, spoiler free review: 
Story: 2/10
I'm not even sure how I should rate this, or if I should even call it a 'story.' To put it simply, there isn't one. So the anime is twelve episodes, and until the 9th-10th episode almost nothing serious happens. Just a regular battle between Ghouls and humans, showing you how it's a chain of revenge and hatred, how both parties are avenging their loved ones and also protecting themselves. And it was okay, I didn't mind it.
Until I was introduced to not less than 25 people in 2-3 episodes. With no explanation, no story build up, no background. Nothing. Just a bunch of violent monsters destroying everything for no damn reason. (Controlling the world!!! buahaha!!!) Then another bunch of monsters kidnapping whoever they like for torture. What???
I want someone to point where the plot is. Where the story, or anything is. The anime relies a hundred percent on its violent and fighting scenes. The points given above are for the general idea, the anime had a great potential to be an amazing one. 
The characters: 2/10
Annoying characters: check ✔
Stupid characters: check ✔
Boring characters: check ✔
hot-headed characters: check ✔
Whiny characters: double check ✔
Weak characters: check ✔
ALL of the mentioned above with no character development: triple check ✔
There is seriously zero character development in this anime. ZERO. (Until the final episode, only 1 character gets developed)
Let's start with our main character: Kaneki Ken.
Your average goody two shoes cliché character who does not hurt a fly and stands to their principles. Now I'm not saying that's a bad thing, I actually love this kind of characters. But the dude's. So. Goddamn. Whiny. I did not mind it at the beginning, I always put myself in the character's place. It is OK to whine considering what has happened to him. But one can only whine so much. I did not have to bear with him crying about how weak he is till the very last episode. He does not want to be weak but he also does not do anything but wallow in self-pity. I wanted to smack him, tell him to get a grip and do anything. He had a potential of being a very lovely character.
Moving on to the second main character: Touka Kirishima
Tough girl with a troubled past. Had to bear with her pain in the ass attitude at the beginning because it was understandable how infuriating it can be to have a harsh life while an oblivious airhead enters your life. Fine, I can bear the annoying attitude but do not also be a hotheaded airhead that acts on their feelings all the fucking time. This amoeba does not think for 2 seconds before doing anything, and no one even cares to stop her. The old man would just go like 'Refrain from doing that.' 'Don't do that, you'll get *us* into trouble.', but she does it anyway. And she's not that strong to begin with, she's reckless and stupid. Oh, did I mention how there's absolutely no character development whatsoever? Because we'll have to deal with this creature the whole 12 episodes this way. 
Eh. I have only watched the anime a couple of days ago and I'm already forgetting the supporting characters. They're that forgettable. After struggling, I managed to remember some of them
Shuu Tsukiyama: A psycho sadist obsessed with Kaneki and his blood. A seemingly very interesting character praised for his strength is actually very weak and easily vincible. Then there's this old, stupid owner of the Coffee shop who cannot control a damn child, and other 30 characters you should not give a damn about.
The only character that I found slightly interesting is Amon Koutarou, a first class police investigator and a cliché character that wants to change the world. Unlike other investigators, he sometimes racks his brains and doubts.
The Art: 10/10
So, so incredibly beautiful. It's like a special time was taken for every character to be drawn and the scenes are put beautifully. Flawless anime art.
Sound: 8/10
The music was very good and the voices were nice and matching.
Enjoyment: 5/10
While everything about the story and the characters and the sequence is completely hideous, as I mentioned above, the anime relies heavily on its fighting scenes, and that's somewhat done well. Enough to make me want to see more in spite of not enjoying how the events are unfolding. Some scenes such as Mado vs. Touka and the final episode.
If I can describe the first season of Tokyo Ghoul in one sentence, it would be:
One piece of shit you cannot stop watching.",4
"
                I enjoyed this anime because I'm easily entertained, but it's a wreck. 
The story had amazing potential, but it was terribly executed. Kaneki becomes subject to a ghoul experience that brings upon his half-ghoul being as he awakens in the hospital. Damn, doesn't that sound cool? No, the story fucked all the potential out of the wall. The story starts off focusing on Kaneki's psychological conflicts as he deals with being a ""monster"" and quickly diverts off topic. Oh no, I'm a ghoul?! That's terr-oh wait let me save my friend. Oh god, I'm a ghoul! I mus-oh hold up I'm randomly about to be
                  eaten now by some flamboyant cannibal. Well, that pathetic and unnecessary fight is over with now. Let me jus-oh wait somebody dies. No big deal, I'll ju-oh man I was kidnapped. It's okay, I'll go through a millisecond personality change and make everything better. That'll impress the audience. The episodes fit poorly together when you exclude all the impressive soundtracks and censored ""amazing"" fight scenes.  It's as if the director ran out of ways to portray a psychologically conflicted individual and added in anything that could be tweaked to appear impressive to the audience. The anime tried too hard to make everything complex and interesting, but it just ended up looking like a pile of layered trash with different colors that were terribly mixed together. The pacing barely made any sense when considering character development and plot development; this is highly due to the extent the episodes pathetically worked off of each other. The individual aspects of this anime: psychological, drama, action, drama, and mystery were poorly done. There wasn't any mystery: it was sloppily thrown together and by the end I wondered what mystery I was truly supposed to be focusing on. It did a good job staying consistent with the supernatural elements and it wonderfully manipulated the seinen audience into thinking it was a gem seeing as this anime managed to get over an 8.0 score. However, the rest of the elements were dog food and fritos mixed in a blender: it didn't make sense and it was distasteful. There were too many plot twists and red herrings and they simply all did not mix. The ending wasn't bad for a climatic ending, but the way it was executed was disappointing. 
The art was heavily watered-down due to the censorship. The characters were attractive and were very distinguishable with unique features. However, neither the looks of the characters or their environmental surroundings heavily impressed me. The art did not heavily hinder the anime, but it did not help it. It lacked realistic depth and was fitting for the personalities of the characters. 
I did enjoy the sound. It's probably what I enjoyed most. I have only watched the Japanese version. I felt power in the voice actors voices and it matched the characters personalities perfectly. It changed with the flow of the story and the transformation of black haired Kaneki to white haired Kaneki is remembered to me by the change of his voice during that time. There was nothing special or unique about the voices overall, but it did help the anime a few millimeters. The soundtracks were astonishing and addictive. I still listen to them till this day and I enjoyed both the outro and intro of this anime. The soundtracks were very unique and touching; it's one of the notable things about this anime. 
The character development was fair, but it was poorly executed. Luckily, the characters shown the most developed somewhat from who they originally were presented as, but it was either too quickly or too slowly. Touka's emotional struggles between loving humans and being a ghoul was barely paid attention to and her shame with being a ghoul was lightly hinted. It's never addressed or poked at and it made her character seem very superficial and uninteresting. Hide's personality virtually goes nowhere. He's always walking away with a blank face knowing what's going on while never addressing it. Which, is fine, but it looks quite silly and awkward when done at inappropriate times. Hinami and her mother are predictable characters with little depth and Tsukiyama shouldn't have even been a character in this show. Somehow, his showy flamboyant personality made this anime just a tad bit less terrible, but he was outrageously displaced. Nishio was the only character that I saw besides Kaneki that got genuine moments of spotlight highlighting why he was the way he was. Kaneki's whole character development was quite comical. He barely had time to develop because random things were always happening to him, but magically he shifted in personality in just a matter of second after he apparently couldn't handle a certain situation anymore. To make it worse, the personality he magically changed from--unrealistically--was nothing more than a carbon-copy of other characters in the story line. He goes from being warming, gentle, and sweet to tough, merciless, and empathetic. The other characters aren't even worth mentioning. While the reactions to what's occurring throughout the story were fairly realistic, they were poorly timed or exaggerated. I couldn't relate to any of the characters due to this poor timing and poor development of the story line; it caused a lack of emotional development in myself towards the anime due to this. 
Despite all these factors, I did enjoy the unique and gory aspects of the anime. I'm easily entertained, so such mistakes didn't bother me much. Though, they were extremely noticeable. 
Overall, I'd recommend this anime to ones that don't mind an all over the place story line with badly developed characters. If you're like me, the big flaws of this anime won't take away from its colorful and intense scenarios. It strongly emphasizes on causing adrenaline and invoking odd interest into its scenes. So, watch with idea of what you enjoy.",7

                ""In a decaying society, art, if truthful, must also reflect decay.""
This quote is not only applicable for the plot of the anime, but its critique as well, and Tokyo Ghoul is a perfect example of it. Tokyo ghoul is the king of cringe and edginess. Especially edginess.
Before I address what I mean by that, let me just get this out of my way right now. This anime is NOT bad. By any means, the plot is fairy interesting, and, uh... yeah, the plot is fine. However, what I really want to talk about is what, for me and some of you I'm sure, completely overshadows
                  this anime. It's the characters, or, their development, if you will.
We got our main boy Ken Kaneki. First off, he starts off as the weakest male lead ever, easily beating a typical harem MC, and arguably, triumphing over Yuki from Mirai Nikki. He is the biggest pussy I've ever seen in my life. However, all that magically changes, when he suddenly, in less than 10 minutes of an episode run,  becomes super awesome cool mega ultra powerful bad-ass alpha guy and reks everyone in his path while tipping his fedora. So cool, so edgy, so awesome.
Or should I say, so retarded.
Then we got ourselves another special snowflake in our hands. Shuu Tsukiyama. As a Mamoru Miyano fan, I can't help but like his voice actor. At times, he reminds me of our lord and savior, sonuvabitch Rintarou Okabe.
But the fun ends there. Just as Ken Kaneki is the edgiest motherfucker you'll ever see, this guy is the cringiest. Every time he appears I mumble to myself ""uegh, god"" and pray he'll leave shortly, which is never the case. He's trying to be portrayed as a cool hipster, while coming off wrong, and, just - lame. (Further discussed in a larger paragraph below)
INTERMISSION: Actually, I was wrong. While watching season 2, it turns out Juuzou Suzuya is even cringier than our buddy Shuu.
Then there's bunch of either forgettable or other edgy characters I couldn't care less about.
The only main character I can really relate to, I care about and I enjoy every moment of, is Touka Kirishima. She is, firstly, a very gorgeously drawn character. I like her haircut, love her cafe work outfit, her legs in pantyhose are irresistible, she acts very womanly, is the right kind of tsundere and I already added her into my 'to impregnate' waifu list. It's not like I wanted to share with you my weird fetishes or anything, b-baka!
There was also a very touching moment where she battles Nishiki and ends up not killing his girlfriend after she complimented her looks while in ghoul form - she made her not feel like a monster she felt she was, and that hits very close to home.
This whole glorifying of psychopaths in present day media makes me sick. The Joker from new Batman, Dexter, etc. OOOOH, look at me, I'm an intimidating cool antagonist, I torture people, cut their body parts and do other atrocious things. 
Nothing's cool about it. You should be beaten to death, see how you like it.
 I don't want to mention too many shows, I feel like I already lost 30% of ""I found this review helpful"" edgelords who are butthurt for having their favorite film/tv series criticized.
This has been on my mind for some time already, and Tokyo Ghoul was simply the breaking point. I digress, as I'm getting WAY off point.
What should instead be glorified, what our society desperately needs, is common sense. And I feel very lonely, in such a world where common sense keeps slipping away, and is continuously declining with every passing generation.
Anime should be a form of escapism, not media, where I am reminded of cruel reality of such a decaying society.",6
"
                Tokyo Ghoul had the potential to be something great but instead fails to met its own expectations and leaves the viewer with more questions then answers in it's 12 episode run. Tokyo Ghoul has a dark theme, good art and a creepy concept which was excellently presented in the first 2 episodes but poor characters/relationships and terrible setting establishment ultimately waters down a lot of the experience throughout the series leaving subsequent episodes feeling boring and mundane.The conclusion sets itself open for a second season but was ultimately undeserving considering the motivations and reasons for main protagonist Kaneki and the antagonist to confront in the
                  end. Although the story didn't hold up, the action scenes are fun to watch from time to time and the art did give off the ominous vibe that it hoped to convoy to the audience which did help remedy the boring dialogue at most points of the series. In conclusion Tokyo Ghoul is a good action show with good art but wasted characters and questionable relationships ruin an otherwise great story,  which is sad to see considering how well the elements were mixed in the first 2 episodes.",6
"
                This anime delivered what I expect from action animes
There was Gore
There was plenty of action
There was a sensible story plot to keep you focused.
It was fast paced
This anime ticked all 4 boxes so i'm pleased and the final episode was sensational. There was some good stuff in this anime. I'd recommend to people to watch it, you definitely won't be disappointed.

"
                It's one of those anime that come out, and 16 year olds immediately change their avatars into characters of the anime or feel inclined to play anime-themed MMOs and make characters that copy the name and appearance of characters from the anime, sort of like Sword Art Online, which was overall better.
Simply put I watched the first 7 episodes, about two per day and I couldn't follow the story at all, it looks like a horrible mess. 
The aspect of some random guy turning into a monster, be it a vamprie, zombie, ghoul, cyborg, magician, undead .. it's so mediocre and overused, it's not even
                  interesting.
The characters looked really uninspired with many of them made to be super cool and badass that it immediately makes it annoying to watch with them around.
I can't put my finger on anything nice about this anime, maybe if it was more realistic than badass hype, it might have been more interesting for me to watch.
I eventually dropped it.",5
"
                Let me just say that this anime had so much potential. This is a bold statement, but I think if the anime lived up to the manga, it could have reached AOT level greatness. Kaneki is an incredible main character. Even if he was executed poorly in the anime, watching his character development was incredible. It tackled grand themes like humanity, cycles of hatred and redemption. One thing Tokyo Ghoul did accomplish really well was showcasing how humans can be more evil than monsters. With themes like that and an amazing main character, I wish this anime was good. I loved the first 2 seasons
                  but re was complete trash. Despite all its shortcomings, Tokyo Ghoul still managed to blow me away at times. While I can't say I love this anime, I can't say I hate it either.",7
"
                One of my favorite animes.... But I really didn't think they would end season 1 like that.. The reason why I like it it's simply because, it's understandable, very detailed, and you can get closer to characters. You don't find animes like that except (My opinion) Naruto, death note, anohana, blue exorcist, etc. My favorite character is Uta. He's one of those characters you'll see hanging around if you look very closely. I can adapt to him and I feel like I can understand more than the other ones. The only thing I didn't like was the ending and how much of a baby kaneki
                  was... He should of just embrace his power and take strict advantage of it. But still anime is a 10/10. Opening song is AMAZING by the way. Best anime opening and my favorite ever, Hear it yourself you'll understand",10
"
                When I started watching Tokyo Ghoul, I was there for three reasons. One, the setting being about ""ghouls"",so I knew this would be the mysterious action filled type, and I was in. Two, I wanted to see what Kaneki's transformation would be like. Three, I wanted to know what was 1000-7. Like all others, I saw that show would be a promising genre and I was hyped. But in the end, the show just went so offtrack that I rated it a 6.
Why?
Simple. Because it lacked APPEAL.
A show needs good appeal in order to make the viewers hang on for the ride. Note that while
                  popularity fetches you the first episode viewers, the appeal of the show's episodes make up tons of enjoyment value to keep them hooked.  Tokyo ghoul lost that pretty much going in. The show strayed away from its protagonist Kaneki, who was the prime reason of watching the show. You put us through 12 episodes before showing his transformation? Very very anticlimactic.  To add to the disappointment was the dramedy (A parody of drama and tragedy) which seriously lost its touch because of how badly the characters were handled. There were so many characters to keep count that we didn't mostly care about. This further made sure we lost Kaneki's arc. Soon, what was supposed to be Kaneki's search for existence turned out into a wine-tasting contest.
But the most notorious of them all, which made sure the show was unexciting, was the fact that we are supposed to be rooting for Ghouls. Murderers, serial killers who eat human flesh. Tell me how I am supposed to root for those people? Granted, they did not become Ghouls of their own choice, but they try to justify their existence by Darwinism. Pathetic. They say that they are supposed to control the population of humans as part of a food chain. IN JAPAN FOR GOD'S SAKES. Do you know how crazy you sound? And they keep using these excuses to justify their existence. Like it is all right for them to kill humans, because humans kill chickens. That is seriously wrong, and misused.
 First, not all humans kill chickens. There are vegetarians too. Second, Killing is WRONG. EVEN CHICKENS HAVE BLUE CROSS. Doesn't mean that you can kill humans inordinately. Third, you using Darwinism is same as the excuse Hitler used for killing Jews. I don't have complains with Ghouls killing humans, but the justification they are using makes me sick. You are all criminals by nature. How can we root for you?
Add that to the fact that Touka kills two innocent policemen in cold blood. Just doesn't help matters.
Anyways, this anime lacks much in plot and characterization, so I suggest you read the manga, which is better than watching 4 seasons of Tokyo going nowhere.",6
"
                I didn´t read the manga nor did I have any knowledge about the story before I watched the anime.
Lets start with the things I liked about Tokyo Ghoul Season 1. 
I enjoyed the ""cozy"" modern japanese atmosphere. 
The surrounding looks quite realistic. Tokyo looks like you would imagine it in a little distopian setting. 
Also the themes were quite interesting. The conflict of the characters living in that world wasn´t that detailed, but it also wasn´t flat. 
But there it ends. Atmosphere in theory is influenced by many factos. Not only the art. 
The overall atmosphere was terrible. The character development was rushed or didn´t exist at all. The sound/music was really uncomfortable (especially the piano). 
Furthermore I didn´t enjoyed the story. It felt rushed from the beginning. I couldn´t develope any sympathies with the characters nor with the world they live in.",4
"
                Where to begin with Tokyo Ghoul. I would personally class this as one of my most enjoyable anime mainly because it was a unique show for the Horror and Psychological genres. 'Unique' because it seems to try something different when it comes to how the characters are developed and how the story is put together. 
The story for me personally is somewhat an emotionally psychological thrill ride mainly because of how each individual character is structured leaving me as a watcher emotionally invested to the point of sitting on the edge of my seat as each part of the story takes a serious twist. 
When
                  it comes to art however, I am clueless. Despite my clueless understandings of the average anime artwork, I can say that the artwork is great and colourful. It has a unique and beautiful colour scheme along with the brilliantly designed features of the show. 
As stated above, I thoroughly enjoyed the characters of this show because I can actually get emotionally invested. However, I do dislike the weak male lead of Kaneki. Every other character is all good in my books.
Overall, for me, Tokyo Ghoul is one hell of a special anime. For those wishing to get emotionally invested in the story, invested in the character or even just want a solid gore show, I personally recommend watching it.",10
"
                Compared to the manga, this anime adaptation of Tokyo Ghoul from Studio Pierrot was alright. The characters are totally different than described in the manga; Kaneki is a total wuss compared to his college bookworm personality from the manga, Touka is a lot more tsundere-like than the manga, and Tsukiyama is less crazier than the manga (Although Miyano Mamoru still did a great job voicing him).
The anime was ok, but, in my opinion, not as good as the manga. The story in the anime tends to be very fastpaced compared to the slow, well thought out, detailed approach of the manga. Tokyo Ghoul just becomes
                  a crappy adaptation because of Studio Pierrot trying to fit a quality manga into just 12 episodes.
Overall, I give the anime 7/10.",6
"
                Tokyo Ghoul this show I can't stop re-watching it's astonishing the story the opening the everything in this anime oh my God I do like this suffering that the main character got how his Brain conquered from depression and fear from death then he just exploded and destroyed everything and he tried to protect his friend I mean his new family I already finished The manga I know the studio mess with the storyline but it doesn't matter I really like the show and the manga.
on the other hand, I don't know why some stupid people underrated these anime don't listen to them just give
                  this anime a chance and watch it.",10
"
                I'll keep this concise because most of the points I'd make have already been explained. Before I begin, I am aware this is the first season based off the popular manga under the same name; and the manga is generally considered to be very good and holds nothing back. However, my opinions will be based off of the first season of the anime alone, for I haven't read the manga yet.
If there is one word to describe this anime, that would be: rushed. Rushed, rushed, rushed. As I was watching, I was often left with too many questions and wondering how something could be executed
                  differently so that it would make more sense and provide more depth. I really liked the ideas and premise coming from the anime, but the delivery was sloppy and many times stone cold.
Story (4)
As mentioned, I really liked the premise. I wish they spent more time developing the story, because I feel that the elements to making a good plot were initially there, but just got lost and scrambled in a massive time crunch. The result was plagued with plot holes, rushed pacing, and awkward event introductions.
Side note (minor spoiler): I was very disappointed by how the ending played out, and you may be disappointed too. It was kind of a deus ex machina moment with an abrupt cliffhanger to bait the viewer into watching the next season. Seemed generic and lazy. 
Character (3)
Probably the most poorly executed aspect of this anime. The introductions of many characters were very awkward and rushed.
We have the MC, Kaneki, who has lived as a human but suddenly becomes a half-ghoul through the transplant of the organs of a ghoul named Rize (never really explained what logic these doctors were using to think this was a good idea considering what happened leading up to this). Kaneki longs to stay as a human, though, and goes through countless identity struggles as he craves human flesh. Aside from a few flashback scenes, we don't know much about him; and his development- like most other things in this anime- is too concise.
Touka, considered to be the other MC, is a ghoul who Keneki supposedly develops a close relationship with. However, there is very little development for her and you will be left still not knowing much about her by the end. 
This also goes for the other ""sidekicks"" who help Kaneki out. For example, I really wanted to know more about Hinami, who is a completely innocent ghoul-child, but of course I was let down.
The antagonists... oh boy. There was only one- Amon- who was developed somewhat decently and was somewhat relatable: *MINOR SPOILER* a human who almost got eaten by a seemingly innocent ghoul who turned out to be a hungry psychopath. The others were those generic, almost comical, ""look at me I'm so evil"" villains you see so often nowadays. Perhaps they had more depth in the manga, but they were so cringe to watch in the anime.
Art (6)
I have mixed feelings about the art, so I'll say it's fair but very inconsistent. There are moments of excellence, with many of the backgrounds and the action scenes with the fully transformed ghouls done very well. But at other times the animation felt choppy and even outdated, noticeable with some simple motions.
Sound (8)
The music is well done. It portrays the mood of each scene diligently, and the opening is very memorable.
Enjoyment (5)
I really wanted to enjoy this more, since I like supernatural thrillers. Unfortunately, I was left disappointed too much. Nonetheless, the action scenes were entertaining and some scenes were pretty memorable.
Overall (5)
This anime had the potential to be a solid supernatural thriller, but it fails to deliver at too many turns; and it certainly doesn't live up to the manga considering the praise it gets for providing details diligently. I feel if the creators spent more time with the show, expanding it to at least double the length it actually is, it would be miles better. It's not terrible, for there are some good aspects. But when taking into account all the other flaws, Tokyo Ghoul's execution is mediocre at best.",5
"
                This is first review ever on an anime, so for my first review i think it would be suitable to review one of my favourite anime. ( Disclaimer this review is biased on my own opinions)
Story: The whole story of the anime starts off with a innocent young boy acting what all teenager would do check out girls and look to score a date. From an innocent date will his whole life be thrown into chaos, as he has to learn how to survive and deal with his new life after his date. 
The story started off very slow and many who are new to
                  anime would consider this to be boring, but the slow start is to build up our MC and develop his own persona in the new twisted world which he has entered. The story of tokyo ghoul will continue to explore how the MC with deal with his new powers and struggle and it is not until near the last couple of episode does the seriously starts to shine and show it's full potential. 
Art: The art is beautiful with mainly full or dark colours, this suits the anime as the anime is not such a horror anime but more of a psychological anime, with the dark colours and theme it suits the show perfectly. Some on the fight can be a bit lacking in art but when it came down to the last fight, the art and animation was amazing IMO.
Sound: OMFG the first thing i have to say is that the opening song is orgasmic and so is the OST. The music suits the show perfectly having a mixture of fast and slow pace for build up intensive fight or emotional scenes.
Overall: My overall enjoyment of this anime is very good and i love this show regardless if it does not stick to the source material as much as it should of. Least the first season of TG stuck mostly to the manga unlike season two... When the time comes for that review i am sure it will turn into a rant ;)
Thank you for reading my review if you did :) I am a fan of anime and i will always love it. 
Keep watching.",9

                *This entire review is about the first season of Tokyo ghoul*
Tokyo ghoul is a really short but really good anime with interesting and great characters, awesome moments and an amazing ending.
The anime is about ghouls in tokyo, like the name already says. Ghouls are pretty much like humans but there are big differences.
1. Ghouls cant eat any food beside human meat.
2. Ghoul eyes turn black with a red pupil when theyre hungry/fighting
3. They have something called a ""Kagune"" which is a certain body part used for fighting
The story is about a teenager named Ken Kaneki which lives a normal life as a human but one
                  day he gets attacked by a ghoul and just barely survives. A doctor then saves his life by replacing his destroyed organs with working ghoul organs. Kaneki didnt know that the organs were ghoul organs but quickly realizes that he's now half human, half ghoul. The entire first season, or simply half of the anime shows how Kaneki unravels himself, which isnt a bad thing, dont get me wrong but after the first season ends the anime really falls off. The second season isnt too bad but its really terrible compared to the manga.
In my opinion you should watch the first season, then read the manga and then watch season 2 for the best experience.",8
"
                Never having read the manga, I didn't really knew what to expect from Tokyo Ghoul. I went in with an open mind, and what I got was an enjoyable experience.
The story starts off with a really interesting premise, although I feel as if it loses some of it's pacing in the latter half of the season. It still kept me interested in what was coming next though, and it wasn't predictable at all, making it very enjoyable.
Both the art and soundtrack were amazing, sporting one of the best and most artistic openings I've ever seen/heard (The first one).
The characters themselves where enjoyable, with the main
                  character being the most interesting person, which is a good thing. The supporting cast was overall a bit weak though, or at least so I felt. Most of the supporting characters felt a bit out-of-place and they made some decisions which felt rather forced.
This however didn't detract from the enjoyment too much. Although it was not an outstanding experience, I'd still say it was a very entertaining one. I'd recommend it to fans of action, with a slight touch of mystery, horror and drama.",8
"
                Before starting this review, I would like to say that this anime is... OVERRATED! (And I am brazilian, so I would like to say sorry if I make some mistakes....)
Sound. (4/10)
Why people like so much of the openings, endings and the soundtrack? The soundtrack is ""normal"", but sometimes it doesn't fit with the anime, the openings and endings too, as i said, this is an overrated anime, and almost all (sound, story, etc) is overrated in this anime, i've critized the sound, but in my personal opinion, i DON'T like it too.
Character. (3/10)
The characters, are really bad characters, if you do not agree, i will
                  show it to you, and saying somethings about some characters.
First - Kaneki, he doesn't do NOTHING until the episodes 11 and 12, he just cryies almost all of the time, and he is a DUMB
Touka - She at least is a ""cool"" character, in personality I say, but she almost dont have any development, just like Kaneki and other characters, and just RUN all the anime...
Juuzou - Why you guys like so much this character? He is just a psycho, and nothing more, even the characters are overrated in this anime.
This characters was just some examples about why the characters are too bad in this anime.
Art and Animation (6/10)
(Art) (7/10)
Tokyo Ghoul anime have a ""normal' art, but it isn't a bad art, it is a good art, but it is a ""normal"" art, i think a better art it is the one that differentiates from the other anime.
(Animation) (6/10)
I think everybody knows that Pierrot isn't a bad studio, BUT makes a lot of mistakes  in popular anime, like Naruto, Bleach, then... Tokyo Ghoul... Okay, okay, i was lying about Tokyo Ghoul hehehe; Tokyo Ghoul don't have a bad animation, but the Tokyo Ghoul animation is a ""normal"" animation, I think they could do a better animation, but as i said it isn't bad, but it isn't good.
Story. (6/10)
Tokyo Ghoul have a such of a great idea; A world with ""Ghouls"" (""Animals"" that look like people and eat humans) with humans trying to kill all these ghouls, and survive; I think this is a great idea, BUT the ANIME put this idea on trash... And transform the story in just a human that became a ghoul, and... Nothing more... The story don't received a worst rate because as i said, Tokyo Ghoul anime has a great idea, but it's used too bad...
Enjoyment. (6/10)
It wasn't a bad enjoyment, but it wasn't good, understand? And i think you can enjoy Tokyo Ghoul more than me... So i think the enjoyment is something more personal than critical.
Overall. (5/10)
The anime is bad in a lot of points, you can see this in my review, and a 5/10 is fair for this anime.",5
"
                This my first review of anime show bare with me. 
First off is the anime shows plot of Tokyo Ghoul anime show tried their best make out total of 166 pages of the manga, but in truth the story of this anime is really bad trust me I had to all the way to read the whole manga to try and understand the plot in whole. they really tried  but they pulled the worst  bits out from the bin to create the show and I mean it.
The plot is so bad that you can't understand from the point of the anime show due
                  to fact they soo badly cut out worst parts of the manga then throw it at the wall to create the whole thing into short show as possible its like making junk to create a bigger pile of junk for views. 
The Art work for the whole anime shows was very great done with each scene details were meet for the anime side, this would give it total of 8/10 because they just stop caring much about the art style after they throw the whole true plot out the window for people to save time. 
The character were well done even though they cut out all the plot truth is the amount of work in the character behaviour was greatly taken from the manga that it should in the first with tiny bits of cuts in my opinion so they did well in this part, I guess... 
to some sum the whole anime in few words is just god awful so far I haven't watch thousands of anime shows yet till then I can't give strong reason about taking cuts from the manga and throwing them out the window. 
Tokyo Ghoul is a bad anime because the throw tons junk at the wall and seeing if it sticks onto the wall to create their own plot from the original plot that the writer created.",6
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is a anime about a human who becomes a ghoul. I found at the start that the anime kind of wasn't my thing, but as it continued it reached my second favorite anime behind Akame Ga Kill. This anime has an amazing story, and doesn't just show the Ghoul side, but also the human side. I love how even though the main character is a monster he still has his morale. Overall I think any anime fan, or just people wanting a good story should check this out. Can't wait for season 2

"
                Okay let's start. *Sigh*
Story (7) : The story is, actually, quite amusing to watch. It unfolds pretty nicely. However, they didn't flesh it out correctly. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THEY CRAMMED 60 CHAPTERS IN 12 EPISODES??? I hate to bring the manga into a review, but we couldn't just let that pass. Godammit Studio Pierrot.
Art (7) : The art is really beauytiful, realistic and all. However kids, rememmber, it's Studio Pierrot we're talking about. Kagunes that look like plastic, stupid censoring (I couldn't stand seeing those damn blurs and black bars. It seems like a joke, and I really wish it was. 
Sound (10) : The
                  OP is a masterpiece and the SFX is really well done. The screams are agonizing but not obnoxious. There's not really much to say.
Character (5) : The show fails epicly when it comes to developing characters, mostly because Pierrot decided to fuck fans and give  12 EPs to develop a bunch of characters. A big bunch. (PS: 20 ~ 30 episodes would be enough for the first part)
Enjoyment (8) : One of the biggest pros of the show. Well-paced battles, really effective cliffhangers and the OST just nails it. Really gets you going and that's why most fanboys and fangirls exist.
Overall (6) : Overal, could've been much better. Make it longer, take out censoring, develop characters properly and that's it.
Moral of the story: Fuck Pierrot",6
"
                Touka should have been the main character, more characters should have become full emo complete with piercings, that’s where this series was leaning but it didn’t go there to it’s own detriment.
Bronies get entire animes made for them, people who like action get mecha, you like ninja’s naruto has you covered, they splurge on the fan base but they couldn’t do it for the emo crowd with Tokyo ghoul. They give just enough but not enough, and the problem is the creators don’t embrace the fan base as good as they could, they must have saw that ‘I’m an emo kid’ song and now they’re
                  laughing at us too, well forget you all I’ve got Touka chan as a waifu, hinami is hot too, it’s all I need",1
"
                Okay let me start this by saying that I did not watch any of the sequel seasons, for the sole reason that everybody says it's shit. I will say though, Tokyo Ghoul season 1 was quite enjoyable to me, which most of the reviews don't agree with I guess.
The main reasons why I feel people were disappointed in this first season was that this season was mostly just an introduction to the setting and characters as well as the dilemmas. People were hoping for these questions and plot points to be wrapped up neatly in following seasons, which they weren't.
Let's start with the story. It's
                  honestly quite a good story in my opinion. I really liked the way things were headed. All the arcs seemed quite well-written to me.
For the art, there wasn't anything fancy or memorable, but it always held up imo. And the sound and music was outstanding for this show, perhaps the best I've heard. 
The characters were pretty good too. While I usually hate a whiny protagonist, it made sense in this context for the pay-off. It was the best way to get accustomed to the ghoul lifestyle from the perspective of a coward.
Overall, I really enjoyed this season. Sure it didn't deliver on it's promises in the following seasons, but I think the first season is great for what it is by itself.",9

                This is an odd one. The series started off with an interesting idea about a college student who after one bad date ends up as a half-ghoul forced to consume human flesh to survive. As a horror premise that’s pretty boss. How is he going to come to terms with this and what corrupting effect will this have on him? They certainly do go in for questions like that, but a lot of the series is focused on the sins of prejudice, which is where things seem to go off the rails a bit. I get that people who consume human flesh to survive would
                  be persecuted, but is that actually as morally outrageous as they make it seem? I mean, having the heroic ghouls only scavenge their food from suicide spots and elsewhere does provide a nice moral ambiguity, but most of the ghouls genuinely go around murdering people and eating them. Not just random people either, these ghouls tend to prefer targeting people they know or feel an attachment to. Friends in other words, or lovers. And how twisted is that? What it comes right down to is that I didn’t think the ambiguities worked very well since I take the view that murder for food or pleasure is wrong (controversial, I know) and many of the scenes where we’re meant to empathize with unrepentant killers left a sick taste in my mouth.
But hey, it’s a horror anime. It’s supposed to be twisted. And viewing it from that perspective it works rather well. Mostly. The adapting to survive in his new environment is suitably gruesome and the treatment of his emotional journey was at least sensible. Figuring out who to trust is also a big concern. So until the ending I was onboard with this idea. That said - it’s not a great ending. Aside from ending mid-battle, the finale was filled with pointless and shocking violence that served no real purpose. And by the end the decent lead’s entire personality has been shredded away leaving only a beast in its place. Delightful. What a reward for finishing the whole thing. I watched the first episode of season two and it only gets worse from there. A terrible end to a series that worked better than it had any right to.",7

                ""Tokyo Ghoul""
Is it right that everyone before seeing this anime didn't know from what his name is coming from?
Now I am going to respond to some questions that I think are useful for beginners to the world of anime to this cool animation:
From where is coming his name?
""Tokyo"" = the city Tokyo/the place where everything is happening
""Ghoul"" = the species of humans that are eating normal human flesh and have some crazy super ""powers""(like a gun that is attached to their body)
Spoiler alert: What is it about?
This anime is about Ken Kaneki who fell in love whit Rize Kamishiro a very powerful ghoul who in the final attack Kaneki and sadly die. After that incident, Kaneki is waking in the hospital and realizes that he got a vital organ transplant from Rize(a ghoul).
His social life is destroyed because ghouls can't eat normal food, only human flesh, or drink coffee. After days of hunger, he becomes so hungry that goes hunting and meets the ""bad"" of ghouls society to newcomers.
After he intergrades in the one community his life changes in a good way until some old rivals of Rize get him and start torturing him until he enters his ""god mode""(he was a one-eyed ghoul = half-human, half-ghoul being the most powerful ghoul)
I think that this is everything important thing about ""Tokyo Ghoul"".
Sorry for the spoilers.",9

                Plot: 50%
Characters: 30%
Art: 10%
Soundtrack: 10%
Plot: 2,5/5
First of all the MAL description is lying. Tokyo in this story isn't cruel and merciless. At least not more than the real Tokyo is. Even despite the presence of ghouls, the people are carrying on their daily life going to cafes, talking about books and going on dates. Ghouls just happen to attack and eat someone every now and then. What are ghouls, you may wonder? In Tokyo Ghoul, ghouls are basically the ""battle shounenification"" of what ghouls were originally defined as. They're flesh-hungry outcasts, who have the ability of shaping weapon-like extensions out of their body, which can
                  appear like a blade, tentacles, flames... basically stuff you might have seen similairly in battle shounens like bleach or naruto before. The overall plot didn't impress me too much. For the most part the plot consisted of elements and progression I have seen been made before and done better. There were some things however that did keep me interested in seeing the conclusion of this series and things I may want to see expanded upon in future seasons, like the underground ghoul culture.
Characters: 2,5/5
The characters also failed to impress me. The biggest focus laid on the main character; Kaneki. There wasn't much to him, that made me relate to him or feel sympathy. All I know about him is that he is a shy guy, who likes books and that he has a good friend named Hide. The last episode gave some snippets on Kaneki, which could have been well utilized previously in the series, but by then it was kinda too late. Another important character is Hirishima Touka, who just like Kaneki wasn't all that interesting and had almost the same conflicts to handle. The series also failed to utilize introduced side characters in efficient ways, other than just being a plot convenience. The most interesting character was Juuzou Suzaya, who was some kind of a radical Edward rip off (Cowboy Bebop), who didn't get nearly enough screen time to lift himself above that title. I also liked Jason as a villain, simply for being a sadistic a**hole.
Art: 3,5/5
The art was the strongest field of the series. The animation was quite fluent and the battles were quite a blast. Unfortunately like most anime the art fellt kinda standardized. I'm referring to how in most anime's the original artist's style gets somewhat lost and it feels like just another anime with no peculiar stylistic vision.
Soundtrack: 3,5/5
Most of the soundtrack wasn't all that memorable, but it also wasn't irritating and bad. Most notable was the opening theme, which allthough whiny, fellt like a fresh breeze, compared to other series. Also the voice acting was really good.
Critical score: 5,4/10
Enjoyment:
I don't really have an enjoyment scale, but depending on how much I enjoyed a series I may increase or lower it's final rating in order to get a rounded number as is visible in the final score.
Final score: 6/10",6

                Where do I start, The anime itself is great, the story and characters develop in a great way that keeps the viewer interested and craving for more. I was hooked right from the start, i binge-watched both seasons in 2 days and i'm currently waiting for season 3. The art is outstanding and really creates a atmosphere around the envoirment. The sound is great and matches with whats going on and not to mention the opening song ""Unravel"" omg its good. The enjoyment is great. You really create a bond to the characters and care for them. Some mor than others (hinami).
I thinks it's a
                  must watch if you're into darker and more developed styles I give it 8/10",8
"
                This is good anime. I rate it high as it was entertaining and told a good story. (SPOILERS)
The story was really good, I love the fact that it starts of in the first episode going on a date and it turns bad. Hes dating a Ghoul which ends up turning on him. But after she was killed, he was injured and got his organs replaced with hers. After that I think they do a good story of him not accepting the fact hes a ghoul until the very end. 
The art is pretty good and the sound is great. The characters are good to especially
                  the main character, they done good with the characters.  
Overall I enjoyed the show I was going to give it a 7/10 but I think it deserves higher, so I gave it an 8/10.",8
"
                Unpopular opinion incoming-
I didn't really enjoy this Anime as much as I thought I would, and that's mainly due to the character development.
For a dark supernatural Anime, I needed to understand the characters motives and actions better. Some may take me for a fool but I just didn't really understand the main characters choices, he seemed all over the place. Also there were far too many jumps in how the character is portrayed.
To me this may have been the writer/director cop out methods.
On the other hand, I thought the art and sound was gorgeous, it really tied in well with the atmosphere.
So overall, I thought
                  it was quite fair.",6

                So much potential, yet the execution was poor.Watching Tokyo Ghoul made me wonder why it got so much hype.
Tokyo Ghoul  can easily be recognised in the anime community,it's theme of gore, drama and a slight touch of horror makes it stand out. When potrayed right and anime with such themes and potential can be outstanding, sadly Tokyo Ghoul did not leave me content. The predictable plot of a protaganist being forced into a world that they couldnt dream of is overdone and should think of retiring....
The adaptation of the Tokyo Ghoul manga i felt was not up to the hype it was receiving, i
                  have not read the manga nor have claimed to, but i can only guess that it is towers above the level of the anime. Although the story is original i cant see anything else to applaude it on. I found the characters highly predictable and forced myself to sit through the scenes which involved the protaganist really doing anything. I find many animes in which the protaganist has the same traits and ideals as ours to be boring and predictable.Kaneki Ken is your average character with the ""nothing bad can ever happen to me"" attitude, which tries to fool the watcher into a state of shock whenever somthing happens to them, i did not find myself sympathising or feeling pitty for Kaneki at any point throughout the dragging 12 episodes. I feel angry when i think of this disgrace of a character and only found myself liking him in the final 5 minutes of the final episode.
As for story, at first i found it slowly dragging on, and when you spend over 5 minutes watching a young man stuffing food in his face only to 'bring it back up' you seem to get impatient and wanting to give up.
Overall, i decided a 6 was a reasonable score to give Tokyo Ghoul, even though its flaws, it still hooked me in and made me watch all episodes (whether willingly or not i dont know) but will i ever want to watch it again? Never in a million years.....",6

                Tokyo Ghoul is an anime that follows the MC as he gets turned into a ghoul (gains powers and eats humans) through unheard-of means and tries to wrap his head around his new form and integrate into the world of ghouls. However, both ghoul hunters and other ghouls have taken an interest in the MC, which begins to cause him issues even worse than having to become a cannibal.
The show is great at upping the ante at every possible point and has beautiful and interesting fights. However, there are some issues with the plot that are only explained in the manga. If you watch it
                  expect some scenes that make you think ""Did I miss an explanation?"" because you did miss an explanation they didn't adapt from the manga. It's quite sad that this is the case in an anime that is otherwise mostly flawless anime.
If you like MCs coming to use their newly inherited OP power or edgelords, then this is for you. (I love these things.) Gore is common, so you should at least be impartial if you are watching this.",9

                Ah, Tokyo Ghoul... The series that got me back into anime, after Naruto. The series is insanely good. 
The start of the first episode is meh. As the series carries on, however, it gets insane and masterful. Like, literally, it's that good, I've got merchandise! 
It's amazing! When you meet Jason, you'll know what I mean. It's gets insane after that. Like woah! Holy moly! Jeeze! 
This is a great series. No doubt about that! I love this series so much... 
The art can be beautiful. It isn't too good at the start, but once you find someone's special power, then it is beautiful.

                ""Tokyo Ghoul"" is one of the popular Anime I've kept off for a long time. Some people like it for being ""Deep & Psychological"" and many hate it for being a bad adaptation of a very popular seinen manga. The majority of people fall either one side of those categories but after sometime (like a year), I just wanted to see what this is all about and I ended up making this review.
Our bookworm/shy MC 'Ken Kaneki', one day got an opportunity to date a hot woman named 'Riza' who seemingly shared the same book interest as him but by the end of the date,
                  she tried to eat him (No, not in the sexual sense but in the literal sense). Turns out she's a ghoul, a blood-thirsty man-eating monster who, by nature has a tendency to devour humans. But due to some (un)fortunate events, Kaneki ends up swapping some of Riza's internal organs with his and she ends up dying. Now Kaneki has to keep his senses straight, by not letting that human-hungry nature surface but the world of ghouls is more than just eating humans.
While I understand why 'Tokyo Ghoul' is considered ""rushed"", it does a few things right.
(*Mild spoilers*)
Let's take one of my favorite scenes in Tokyo Ghoul. ""Touka vs Mado"" & ""Kaneki vs Amon"".
Just before the real fight, there's a 5 minute dialogue where Amon confronts Kaneki about whether ghouls even feel grief for their man-eating nature and Touka confronts Mado about their ghoul-hunting nature when the only thing ghouls want is to live. This scene plays out really well because of not what the dialogue is, but rather who's saying it.
Touka, a ghoul who tries her hardest to conceal her man-eating nature from her dear friend who's making her eat shit (in ghoul terms), she's a ghoul who just wants to live along with humans but her ghoul nature is opposing that mindset of hers. Amon, a human who just saw his colleagues who he just got to know a bit, got slaughtered in front of his eyes for absolutely no reason.
(*Mild spoilers end*)
There's an interesting duality that's being portrayed between ghouls & humans. They're hunting the other kind, on their own rules & values which you can understand but from an outsider perspective, you really can't tell ""who's right"", or more importantly ""who's wrong"". This dilemma is so well portrayed, especially in the after mentioned scene by interchanging their individual dialogue, cutting at the right moment and delivering the punch.
Tokyo Ghoul characters, much like humans, have an exterior side & an interior self.
On the exterior you have the edginess, which was greatly portrayed with character designs & bit of a ""I'm badass"" personality everyone has within them. Aside from Kaneki, literally no character in this Anime feels uncool, even someone like ""Yoshimura"", who looks like your regular old man you see at a coffee shop has a cool personality and the Anime does a great job at nailing this side. On the interior you have the human side that wants you to care for these characters by either showing regrets & difficulties of their past (Jason) or by showing how hard these characters try to fit into society just to not lose that dear person (Kaneki, Touka, Nishiki and many). And this interior is what TG failed to create. It never lets you feel for these characters even when absolutely terrible things happen to them (flashbacks to Hinami) and that's due to its fast pacing, rushing the story to get into 'good' bits without any proper buildup. So if you take out the emotional part, what's left? The Edge. And that's basically what Tokyo Ghoul characters are & what TG became. An edge fest with very little drama, somewhat of a self-insertable protagonist and a lot of characters with cheap tricks to make them 'human'.
The anime did somewhat of a job to nail the emotional side, by letting inner thoughts of Kaneki to surface but for the most part of this season, Kaneki is just a crybaby who's feeling pathetic for being a half-ass in everything and his words feel as empty & generic as you can think of your regular shounen protagonist. We'll see the world through Kaneki so it gives us an edge for being more empathetic towards him than others but apart from him, everyone else is so lifeless. For a story that's trying to talk about human nature via inhuman characters, you really need to make them emotionally investing because being human is something more connected to the soul than the mind. And if not, we can't feel the actual weight of the drama and that's basically Tokyo Ghoul. But despite all the things it left and wasted, there's one thing that it succeeded to do right and that is the last episode, the famous badass transition.
Kaneki's torture episode is the highest point the Anime ever reached (The infamous white-hair finger-snap transition). Because now, not only do we see Kaneki reflecting on everything he did & didn't, we also get to see his backstory showing how he became the whiny boy he is and letting Riza take advantage of it. So when he snaps into a ghoul, it just feels badass. But for this one moment, the Anime sacrificed so much of its potentially emotionally investing characters by making things too fast.
I see no problem in art style or animation, unless you've watched the censored version.
The OSTs done by ""Yutaka Yamada"" (same guy behind ""Great Pretender"" and ""Vinland Saga"") fits with the tone the show is trying to make and does a pretty good job at it. And I don't need to talk about ""Unravel"" and ""Glassy Sky"", the songs are lit and many who haven't even watched the Anime might know how popular these are.
""Tokyo Ghoul"" is not a bad Anime. It's a decent psychological drama but lacks the soul to pull off a potentially amazing story that it has with every one of its characters.",6
"
                Story: For the most part, the story as consistent and almost everything that had happened was left explained. Sure, some things did not get explained at all or very much, but perhaps they are things that are supposed to be revealed later in perhaps another season. That being said, I will not say that this hindered the anime very much for this particular season. In the beginning of the anime, we saw how Jason was attempting to kill Rize. It gave us a good sense of the dangerous nature of some ghouls and some information on the presented characters' information. A particular conflict in Tokyo
                  Ghoul that made it very good was the clash betweem morals of ghouls and humans, particularly played by Kaneki and Amon. Kaneki attempted to argue for a place in the world where ghouls and humans co-existed and how humans were just as gruesome and horrific as ghouls. Little things like these help to build up the perfect anime. And the scene where Touka defeated Tsukiyama, while it may have seemed unnecessary for the anime for progress, I saw it as a chance to present to us that some humans can find ghouls attractive and fitting to co-exist with them. It also showed that even ghouls like Nishiki, who had lost all faith in believing others, found an exception in a human. It came to the point where Nishiki was even willing to give up his life for her when Tsukiyama threatened to consume/kill her. That is a scene that while does not necessary matter too much if it was replaced with some other scene is what helped to refine the foundation that was already created in the anime. Overall, I believe that every little bit of Tokyo Ghoul really helped to make it shine and I feel that it could have not been executed so well if the author and producer did not work so closely on the minor details for every page and scene.
Story Rating: 7/10
Art: Tokyo Ghoul's art is pretty amazing. Everything about the anime is pretty well drawn, and while it is not amazing, it is very appealing to the eyes. The fight scenes are well animated and the colors of the kagunes are very vibrant.
Art Rating: 9/10
Character: The main character, Kaneki Ken, definitely deserves some praise as he is one of the best I have ever seen. Upon his transformation into a ghoul, Kaneki does retain some of his human traits. However, after his incident with Aogiri Tree, we notice parts of him that are easily relatable to us. Kaneki is pressured into changing for the sake of protecting himself and his friends and while this is a humanly desire for him, his nature of a ghoul is what makes this character so interesting and unique. Now. the some of the other characters do deserve credibility for making the Tokyo Ghoul great, too. Amon serves as a particular contrast for Kaneki. It is as if he is the CCG version of Kaneki and instead of protecting what is dear to Kaneki, he chooses to protect the society from ghouls. He is a great character that serves as a moral and physical obstacle for Kaneki. At some point, Amon questions Kaneki if he is just like the rest of the other ghouls. Characters such as Hinami serve as a developing tool for the anime's foundation. Hinami and the incidence with her parents serve to illustrate to viewers that the nature of some of the dangerous ghouls that lurk in Tokyo . Overall, every somewhat important secondary character in Tokyo Ghoul served a role that made watching the anime so enlightening and an enjoyment. While some characters may not have received a lot of development, the purpose of the characters really overshadow that downside to them.
Character Rating: 8/10
Enjoyment: I really enjoyed Tokyo Ghoul. I felt that it was good in the sense that it kept me hooked on every episode and at no point did I feel that I should take a break from it.

                So Tokyo Ghoul a Psychological ""Horror"" anime, 
I put horror in quotes because it wasn't very horrific the worse was the gore, but yeah anyways Now I enjoyed the Anime, but the Manga was much better they left stuff out, and changed the ending, but unlike I've heard some people say that it's a horrible adaptation I disagree, I think it worked for what it was, now I do wish they did better, but the Psychological affects of Becoming a ghoul was there, and I actually liked the Way Kaneki was him being a wuss was what made him who he is, and everyone's gotta
                  agree that Unravel is freaking amazing, however the opening had crap tons of spoilers, and Some of the changes took out some humour, but I love the ending things where they had the whole comedy thing, but that is all I have to say, I know my reveiws aren't the best, but I'm trying my hardest, and I enjoy making these so yeah",7
"
                I don't know why people hates Tokyo Ghoul so much but it was one of the best anime I have ever seen. It was full of darkness, the thing I lives in. It was so deep that it found a way to my heart and am now I'm left with nothing, but sorrow. All those pain, Kaneki went though was so awful that even I felt the pain while watching it.
So, a guy Kaneki who is half human and half ghoul (man-eaters) wanted to do something better for both of the community, ghouls and human and ended up with worst circumstances. He tried to do
                  his level best to build up a mutual understanding between both community, but that's backfire him pretty badly that he even lost his best friend Hide, his little family and was rewarded with hatred.
Not going into very deeply, in short you should try this anime :) don't miss your chance watching such an epic anime by reading trashy reviews against it. Everything haves pro's and con's, but over this people are only focused towards con's they didn't care about pro's. And yeah people used to think it's OP theme is nothing more than trash but today it's one of the best OP of anime.

                What does it mean to be human? To be a ghoul? Those are the questions Tokyo Ghoul raises once you inevitably (if you're like me) get hooked on it. 
There's a decisive battle between the ghoul and human aspect of our protagonist; one who was turned into a ghoul against his will; one who struggles with accepting who he has become. You may find yourself annoyed with Kaneki Ken but after what he's been through, you may find yourself doing the same thing. It's so morose that you can't help but wonder what did these people do to deserve such tragedy? 
It's not a complex
                  thing to understand, this show, but it will have you thinking. And enjoying it.",10

                So all of the Summer anime's are finally ending and Tokyo Ghoul being one of the more famous and well talked about anime is simply a must watch!! For several reasons. Dont compare it to the manga tho because i know its very different how the story goes well when certain events happen. However for just pure enjoyment please WATCH IT!! Just from watching Tokyo Ghoul like it makes me wanna read it even more!!  
Is pretty simple and easy to follow, and I have to say the story line is what kept me watching. Its like a mixture of zombies and humans living
                  in society. kind of. But story line is very interesting. if you like gore and torture and monsters eatting people to survive then definitely watch tokyo ghoul. 
The voice acting and the screams and expressions were simply AMAZING!! so realistic and just ASTONISHING!! Like u actually felt bad for the people getting tortured or killed. I dont even know how they can match that for english dub. 
Characters and Art they were pretty average, like nothing special about it character wise. But for art i thought it was beautiful in a way. Whenever their kune would release i thought it just so beautiful. The OP animation for it shows it. 
Overall i gave this anime a 9, because you can really enjoy it. The suspense the torturing and the gore parts (even tho they block out the really gorey scenes) but u get the picture. I just hate how it ended like as a cliffhanger like you deff can sense a season 2 coming in the near future the way it ended. But watch it, and give it a chance.",9

                Tokyo ghoul is the reason you should ask for somebody's age after they give you an anime recommendation. For so long i'd heard how great it was online, but the synopsis would always push me away. But I finally caved and started watching it, and absolutely hated it.
From the squealing vocals of the intro, to the entire overarching melodrama of the whole show. I cringed through every ""emotional/dramatic"" ending to an episode, hoping the next episode would change things.
The tsundere is absolutely insufferable in how much attention she demands and disrespect dished out.
I assume the voice actor for Midoriya (MHA) is the same for this
                  protagonist as he's constantly crying, groaning, sobbing, choking, wheezing, vomiting, begging, screaming...
 The action was pretty ok, except that there appears to be no rhyme or reason as to why one loses and another wins.",3

                Wwwhhhaaattt? WWWHHHAAATTT? 7.85?! WHAT KIND OF *%$& IS THIS? Okay I apologize, let me calm down.
So if you guys can't tell, I think this anime is pretty great. I DIDN'T SAY I LIKE IT THAT MUCH (Enjoyment: 7) but it is, simply put, amazing. There is so much to take away and to learn from this anime that I can not believe that it has less than an average score of 8.5. I don't usually like doing this but I am going to give A STEP BY STEP REVIEW ABOUT WHAT MAKES THIS ANIME SO INCREDIBLE.
STORY: 10
Creative concept, amazing execution, very subtle advancement of plot
                  that slowly brings you to the ending which is just mind-blowing. This anime can only be described as one thing, a tragedy. Really the greatest anime tragedy I've ever seen if we're being honest.

Kaneki is a wimp which makes him the perfect victim of the situation and makes the ending all the more depressing. All the characters make sense and even though some of them may be terrible Amon is the greatest christian boy of any anime so I'll let it slide.
ENJOYMENT: 7
...
THE ANIME STILL DESERVES THE OVERALL TEN OKAY.
I get why some people wouldn't like this anime but all I can say about it is that it's a work of art. If you can't stomach blood/cannibalism I don't recommend it but anyone with good taste should enjoy this anime. It can be kind of boring but it's so deeply profound that I can't give it anything less than a ten. But whatever, to each his own.

                        To be honest, this series wasn't on my download list this season, due to a...well, by my point of view, a bit odd story that I got from few users review before. Remember, don't judge a book by its cover? After that, I tried myself to watch the 1st ep which was out on July 4th~though I watched it around July 5th or 6th.
I never expected the series that I was put on dropped list would be this good. The first scene lead us to see such a terrific ghoul who is devouring humans, duh damn horror.
                  The entire 1st ep shows how the main character gets involved in this ghoul thingy and it makes us curious what would happen to him after that.
    The art amazes me so much! Both gore scenes or those bloody nightmares, but to be clear, there are so many censored scenes when it comes to violent. So please, don't expect too much until the BD is out.
I almost like all of the characters in this series. So unique, they're involved to pave the way how the story will end. Their probs are heart-touching (ಥಿ∀ಥ ；)
However, I sometimes do not like the main hero character which is 'weak'. Well, he is not but yeah he is lol. His mental state seems not ready to face the truth of who he truly is, turned into half-human and half-ghoul who needs to feed himself with human.
    The best point for this series are the soundtracks! Both the opening theme and ending theme. Try to listen to it, and you will know what I mean.
From 1-10, worst to the best, I will rate 7.5 for Tokyo Ghoul series (since I got upset after waiting for few weeks of the ending which is one of worse ending ever. The viewers got high since first 'til half of the story just to wait the maximum point at the very end).
​
Pros:
It can provoke your curiosity well
The gore, bloody scenes
Cons:
The story goes well, then it surely drops its point when reach the late eps",9

                Tokyo ghoul pleasantly surprised me when I started the first season. Considering that I was never the kind of person who loves horror anime, I didn't give it a chance at first when I heard about this anime. I'm very glad I was able to overcome my doubts and I gave it the chance the anime deserved, becoming one of my favourite anime.
The story was beyond my expectations. At the beginning I thought that It'll be that kind of anime which does not advance, remains at the same point (the fight between the humans and the ghouls). Along the way, the story changed, showing more
                  drama. I loved that nothing was predictable since predictable things are boring to me. The narrative was interesting and with many twists and turns. Even though the drama was there more than any other genres, it didn't feel excessive or forced. Comedy was certainly not lacking, playing a big role on the character development. Ghouls and humans would have never understood each other because they are different species that just can't live together, humans blaming them for killing without thinking that they don't have anything else to eat and without thinking that there are bad ghouls and good ghouls like in human society. If I were to choose a side, I'd go with ghouls but that's just because I got attached to ghoul characters more. 
The Art is a simple one, yet very beautiful that fits with the story vibe. The fights are perfectly outlined looking very realistic and every fight has an unpredictable end. The character's expressions are more simple, but they are indeed beautiful. The scenes are carefully build and in harmony with the soundtrack which helps set the atmosphere of the scene. In conclusion, the art is fairly average, doesn't stand out but it's a fair one.
The sound is one of the best things in Tokyo ghoul. The songs are perfect for the scenes they've been chosen for, giving us more pleasure in watching the series. I can say that Tokyo ghoul's soundtracks are one of my favourites reaching to the point where I'm listening to them daily. The songs are very diverse, being able to express happiness, sadness, despair, freedom etc. In my opinion, the opening is the best and one reason is TK's voice (The Ling Tosite Sigure's vocalist) which expresses Kaneki's feelings so well as if he's really Kaneki. All the openings are very good and have a deep significance of the season they are from. Not only the openings are important though, the endings are very special to me too and Tokyo ghoul doesn't even have a bad song in it. 
The characters have been constructed differently, each having a backstory, some more shocking, others happy or sad. We've been offered many details even for the characters that seemed insignificant which for me is a plus. Every character's past is very important  too, helping us to understand better a character, since many times we end up judging a person without knowing them. Each secondary or background character was given the chance to appear more in the scenary and I liked that they didn't do everything about the main character. You could feel the emotion of every single person just by watching their actions, speech not being necessary to greatly develop the character throughout the anime. A well-done secondary character is Arima which, at first glance seems an invincible character without any worries or stuggles, but later on his inner thoughts are shown, Arima's only wish being to save the destroyed world. I loved that they didn't try to make the characters perfect because in the end, nobody is perfect. If I were to say a con to the character creation, that would be the simple fact that the studio didn't choose to put accent on the new characters from season 3 like in the manga.
Yes, I enjoyed Tokyo ghoul with my whole heart. It was unexpectedly good for me and I re-watched it more times than I could count. I think that not everyone can enjoy the anime because the theme isn't that common in the first place and sometimes can get horror. The season 3 and 4 weren't created as the manga was and that was a big minus to the anime because many people began to have a bad impression. For me, it didn't really matter since I didn't feel like the story is missing but I read the manga as well for a full experience.
Overall, Tokyo ghoul is an anime that doesn't bore , it's a show that managed to amaze me in every moment. Every detail has a significance which riches the atmosphere and the universe of the series. Even If Tokyo Ghoul might not be for everyone because of the gory scenes that could affect some people, I still strongly think that it's one of the best series I've ever seen.",10
"
                An interesting and gripping concept to keep you on the edge of your seat. The animation was lacking but VA’s were great. I would recommend reading the manga first as the show gets very sidetracked from the original storyline. Character design and personalities were all varied and spectacular, making the show more intriguing. The journey starts with student Ken Kaneki who manages to get a date with a ‘girl’ in a bookstore but she turns out to be the binge eating ghoul Rize (how unlucky can a guy get?) , just as she was about to attack Ken metal pipes miraculously fell upon her allowing
                  Kaneki to just about survive. Although he wakes up in a hospital, his organs had been switched with Rize’s turning him into a half ghoul half human - will he be able to keep back the urge to eat human flesh? In conclusion the anime was okay to say the least, the manga was much better in my opinion but it’s worth a watch.",7

Enjoyment: 9
Overall: 8
This is my second time watching Tokyo Ghoul, my first watch of the season being when it freshly came out. This anime was beautifully executed while keeping the plot at a steady pace. Most negative reviews I had seen were manga readers complaining about the lack of depth that the anime had compared to the manga, but I feel that if studio Pierrot added every development point added in the manga the season would've been up to 30 episodes. 
[SPOILERS BELOW]
Every episode was captivating. While I wish the art was closer to the mangas style, it was stunning and the work put into each scene is obvious and paid off in making the show visually appealing. While the story's main plot in this season is the most average ""divide in society"" thing you can imagine, the season is saved by the development of characters on both sides and its occasional slice of life style.
Once Rize is killed by the beams and we begin to see the show unravel (pun not intended), everything truly felt like it was falling right into place. The culture shock Kaneki felt after stepping onto Nishikis' ""territory"", the open cannibalism in the ghoul community, and seeing just how well they all blended into human society. I am a sucker for stories revolving around bringing two different communities together, so naturally I loved seeing the differences in both sides and how they interacted with one another. 
The introduction of Ryouko and Hinami was beautifully done. A mother and daughter fleeing to safety to show the humanity of ghouls is easy to predict, but effective. Another example is Toukas friendship with Yoriko, or Nishikis relationship with Kimi: predictable, but effective. The art with calming neutral tones and soundtrack with light music captivated me to really feel just how happy these characters were in their ""human"" moments, and the sudden change when faced with their ghoul reality to a darker palette and noise was very beneficial in world building.
I began to lose interest during the Aogiri arc, purely because I was more interested in Rize and Kaneki's conversations than the small war happening outside Kaneki's mind. The conversations that went on as Kaneki slowly lost his sanity could not have been done better; the white purity of his mind slowly turning red as he allowed Rize's mentality seep into his own, the anger he finally stopped repressing against his mother, and the final acceptance of his new ghoul identity. 
I am excited to continue to the next seasons and have incredibly high hopes.",8

                ""IT'S BETTER TO SUFFER YOURSELF THAN TO HURT OTHERS""
One of the most striking anime series that I have ever seen. A completely new approach of Director Shuhei Morita, who created ten years earlier ""Kakurenbo""(Hide and Seek), an anime series that did not catch the audience much. ""Tokyo ghoul"" is quite another matter! The story is fascinating from the very first seconds, and then you just start living inside this complex multi-faceted world. A world that very much resembles our real world. The eternal confrontation between good and evil in ""Tokyo Hum"" is presented with all possible contradictions that the main character Kaneki has to face
                  every time...
How do you make the only right choice when you realize that there is simply no perfect solution? Or rely on the lesser of evils? Kaneki does not hesitate, and his beliefs are so strong that it is really only HIS own choice, for which he takes full responsibility. Good-natured and childishly naive, he trusts almost everyone he meets, for which sometimes you have to literally pay with your own blood. Without retreating, standing up after each wound inflicted, he resists the evil even within himself. Consciously trying each time to overcome vicious temptations, Kaneki offers his game, the rules of which he learned for himself from childhood (only at the end of the first season before the viewer opens the veil of secrecy about his childhood and maternal parting words, which the young hero will keep in his heart forever). Throughout the series, you can't stop admiring his purity of views and desire to change the principles accepted by his friends and enemies at all costs. Words can't Express the constant tension that you feel when you watch a young ghoul rush into the thick of things, risking everything for the sake of his friends and family.
Interest is aroused by all, without exception, characters! The creators seem to have instilled living strings in them, and at some point you start to realize with a bit of madness that they are as real as everything that is happening around us today. Anime in General, in my opinion, has a mystical power that can invade the human world, thanks to the deep immersion of human thoughts in this fantastic culture. And since the thought of a person is material, it is worth recognizing that many motives of Japanese animation, especially such as the story of the ""Tokyo ghoul"", have long been settled in our living environment. Someone this thought may seem creepy, but I hasten to reassure – I, of course, do not mean the material embodiment of monsters on the streets of cities and villages, but rather, I mean a kind of perception of the surrounding reality (few people know, and it is not so easy to count, but according to the most conservative estimates, the number of people on the planet who regularly (!) watch anime, in 2020 reached about 870,000,000 people! Although there are more bold conclusions based on Internet queries around the world, talking about 20% of the total population of the globe. And this, by the way, corresponds to the population of the entire planet at the beginning of the 20th century).
I know a lot of people who have reviewed this anime more than once. I think that I will soon become one of them. As a good friend of mine (a fan of anime since childhood) said, ""Tokyo ghoul"" can be compared to the Bible, after a while you read it again.
This is probably the case when I could recommend this series for the first acquaintance with anime to those who have not yet discovered this page of the wisest Japanese culture. Here, in a surprising way, almost all of the foundations of morality and virtue presented in human society are combined. Caring, self-sacrifice, a sense of duty, tolerance and respect, the eradication of vices within yourself and love, expressed here in a special way, as the only way to salvation…
For me, this story (I think, as for many others who do not consider anime only entertainment) is another step towards self-discovery. That's how I took this magical combination of wisdom and anime colors. Or rather, their beginning is season I. There is a continuation of the story ahead. And if you haven't met Kaneki yet, find a few hours of free time. You will definitely not regret and will never call these hours spent!",9

                So I am a Tokyo Ghoul Fanboy, so this may be a bit biased. 
I do think Tokyo Ghoul doesn´t get the appreciation in the comunity it deserves. Yes there are Animes with a lot more story and heart, yes there Animes with better or at least more versatile artstyle and yes there are Animes that have better character developping. 
As everyone agrees the soundtrack is great and leaves not much to be desired. 
So my Ratings are:
Story 7:
So i watched the Anime first and because I didn´t want to wait until Season 3 aired, i started to read the manga. TL;DR The Manga is
                  at least 10 times better, but tell me any book whose film or adaption isn´t mediocre in comparison. You could go as far as to mention Lord of the Rings, although the films were great the books were better. 
So why am I writing about LotR, books and movies? Because Tokyo Ghoul is nothing but a small adaption. SMALL, should be the word you highlight because it leaves out a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff u have to leave out to not get Anime with 100+ episodes. It is a small Anime to watch if you have a weekend off and nothing to do.
The Story while lacking some parts is quiet nice if you are into supernatural, vampires etc. 
Art 6:
So I really tried to be fair with my rating, so while I really enjoy Tokyo Ghouls Art and Artstyle and a little love for the detail with Food f.e. , the diversity is just not existing, as every character has only 2 Outfits at max and it´s based in a mostly not to detailed City. But once again; it has only 12 episodes+ 12 of the next Season. What can you expect? 
Sound 9: 
So tbh there is nothing much to say then listen to the in- and Outs. 
Character 8:
So while browsing threw the Reviews I always saw low numbers at character development, which is just ununderstandable for me.
Kaneki is finally a not superstereotype, heroe. He himself doesn´t even want to be it and this fact alone makes Kaneki a superintresting character who develops from a shy boy who ignores the rest of the world to someone who is ready to take a step into darkness. His internal struggle is really deep and makes him even more intresting. While the most other character really aren´t special, Kaneki is the reason you should watch the Anime.
I touched on the stereotype a little, with what i mean; a always friendly openhearted sometimes a bit dum maincharacter you kinda fall in love with because he is the typical shonen guy. People do like this Kind of heroes a lot more because they can dream of being this one chosen guy that can beat everyone with enough Training and the will or heart or power or something like this. People do love these kinda heroes because they dream of being speical being the one chosen one. Kaneki in fact states he is no protagonist and mixes the always repeating brave developping somehow special maincharacter-stereotype up.
In fact Tokyo Ghoul goes really deep in psychological routes, but to get a glimpse of that you have to really ""WATCH"" the Anime and try to understand and try to make conections not just watch it because you are bored. You should think about the characters and how similiar you might be to one or another.
Enjoyment 10:
Tokyo Ghoul may not be the best show out there but it is far away from the worst. It is a small Anime, one that invites you to read the manga. One you can easily finish on one Weekend and a refreshing different one and a very good entrance into the deep animeworld if you haven´t set a step yet, apart from the big ones. 
If you want a deeper meaning in an Anime you can find it here as well. If you want to see an actionloaded Anime, you have some things in here. If you wanna see some blood; OPEN THE GATES. 
Overall 8:
So once again a last time: SO (yes i am aware of my overuse): Afterall Tokyo Ghoul is a good show to enter the deep-sea of not-mainstream Animes. If you are anoyed by the typical stereotype superheroe Kaneki will be a great refreshment, in whom a lot of People can seek and find themselves and not their dream.",8
"
                Well let's just say that I watched this whole anime in one sitting, and the second in another. 
Well... I watched the first 2 episodes of Tokyo Ghoul when it came out, but I really wasn't into the characters or art style. Now, jumping back into this realm, my mind has completely changed. This only goes to show that the time of you your life in which you watch an anime, highly effects your enjoyment of said series. 
I really enjoyed watching as a new world emerged around a previously normal person and how he dealt as he was thrust into a new and horrifying
                  environment. I think that Kaneki's emotions and reactions were quite realistic and, as the show progresses, especially into the second season, you can see how this one event changed his life into something of a nightmare. 
The action is fast paced and the characters are all enjoyable, whether they are twisted or innocent.",10

                REVIEW WITH NO SPOILERS
First of all I will explain a point: Tokyo Ghoul is one of my favorite stories. And I am not talking about animes, but in general (books, movies, animes, series...); and i need to admit that there are a lot of personal feelings and impressions in that.
But I need to be sincere, this first anime it's not what Tokyo Ghoul could really be. I recommend to everyone go read the manga, and maybe there you will understand what I feel about this story.
The animation is about 5, not that bad but not that good. And about the story, a lot of stuff
                  was cutted or changed from the original material.
But this first season wasn't that bad, and I still appreciate it because this was the way i've been introduced to this universe.
Well this is becoming a personal diary about how Tokyo Ghoul is important for me hahahaha. So I will resume in this:
If you want some gore and unpredictable monster anime, with a weak protagonist... but who will evolue (or not.. hahaha) with time... and a lot of interesting supporting characters, this is what you're looking for!!",7
"
                Tokyo Ghoul was probably one of the first animes I was introduced to. At the time, I was not particularly interested in the show, and ended up dropping it after around the second episode. However, after some consideration, I ended up going back and watching the season. Looking back, I had no idea why I was not motivated to continue watching Tokyo Ghoul. The whole plot idea was very intriguing, and it starts off with Ken Kaneki who undergoes a surgery in order to save his life after a run in with a ghoul, that turns him into a hybrid half ghoul, half human. 
However,
                  there are several aspects of the show that could be modified. One of my main issues with Tokyo Ghoul is that most of the supporting characters are underdeveloped. After around episode four or five, suddenly we are hit with a mass of side characters, who's pasts or motives are unknown. A redeeming feature regarding the characters in Tokyo Ghoul is that each character is individualised, and has their own specific characteristics. The character development is also quite gradual throughout the show (in my own opinion), as Kaneki continues to deny his ghoul urges for majority of the season. I can understand that he was attempting to adapt to the whole 'ghoul lifestyle' and everything, but it was very infuriating for me to watch him deny the inevitable. Although, near the end of the season, It was great to watch Kaneki finnally accept himself, and he ended up being totally badass in the last episode. As for the second main protagonist Touka, I believe her personality is honestly very annoying as she often drags in other characters into her own problems. She is very headstrong, which is a good trait, but this also leads several of the other characters into conflicts due to her thirst for revenge. Hide, who plays Kaneki's best friend is a complete mystery. We know nearly nothing about him, except for the fact that he and Kaneki have been best friends since childhood. Also throughout the show we are given hints that Hide knows of Kaneki's status as a ghoul, but we are not given exact details about this. The only other notable characters are Jason and Rize. Jason is depicted as being quite psychotic (for obvious reasons), but I felt that his lack of presence throughout the middle of the show dampened his effectiveness as a proper villain.
The art for Tokyo Ghoul is fine, nothing special but nothing particularly lacking. As the show progresses, however, it becomes apparent that Tokyo Ghoul needs a more atmospheric and interesting style to suit its themes. The animation can be a bit choppy and falters at some critical moments. To contradict this though, Studio Pierrot does some very well executed scenes, especially towards the end of the season (especially during Kaneki's hallucinations and internal conflicts with him and Rize). I especially liked how the animation was done for each ghoul's kagune, as each one was very unique and had their own special factors. 
The music and sound was very good for the anime. The sounds enhanced critical scenes, and really gave more depth to the story. The opening song really complimented the art in the OP, and I thought it was very fitting for the anime. The voice acting was very solid for the sub version, (I typically don't watch the dub version, so I wouldn't know how that was)and there was a very good cast for it. 
Tokyo Ghoul is more about the action than a deeper meaning. There are a couple of twists, but nothing that is particularly groundbreaking. Overall, the watching experience was good. The anime and art were great, as well as the plot, although the characters were really what made and broke the anime in several aspects. However, when overlooked, the anime itself is quite good. I found it interesting watching Kaneki struggle to develop and change in order to protect the ones close to him, and I am looking forward to watching the development in the second season.",8
"
                People hate whiny brooding crybabies. When I was watching NGV, I can't count the number of times I'd wish Shinji would just man the hell up, and I can definitely see a lot of people getting turned off by Ken Kaneki for the same reason, along with the dark emo undertone of the entire anime. Despite its numerous flaws, there is a lot of fun to be had in this blockbuster of an anime.
A good anime doesn't always have to break new grounds. It can be something that's executed extremely well. Especially when it's 2018 and pretty much every conceivable plotline and ideas have been
                  previously thoroughly explored. Tokyo Ghoul, in essence, a shonen action anime disguised as something made for adults. No amount of blood and gore and crying will make Tokyo Ghoul more than what it is. And it never tries to be.
Cool fight scenes. Ghouls with special powers. Humans with special weapons. Everyone has a clear motivation. Everyone has a point. You're there to watch them duke things out.  Tokyo Ghoul doesn't push boundaries when it comes to storytelling. It relies heavily on a formula. Despite that, all the important ingredients of a good anime are there.  
Fluid animation. Color palette that establishes the mood and feel of the world. Cold, Dark, broody, and smothering but can at times shine brilliantly when characters are having their moments. The soundtrack, voice acting and the ambients are handled with care.  
Characters who grow and change. Heartwarming moments. Some genuine ""oh shi-"" moment, even though you can see it from miles away. The supporting characters are the real star of the show, and help makes Tokyo Ghoul a pleasant ride.  
Of course, they had to change things, as is often the case when a manga is adapted into an anime. However, I thought the overall feel of the source material has been conveyed adequately. For those who have never been interested in anime before, this would be a decent place to start. For those long-time anime lovers, there are definitely still some fun to be had if you allow yourself to get past all the screaming and crying.",8
"
                The truth is that the anime does not adhere to the story of the original manga. There is too much censorship, or rather, very little violence. And to be honest, that's what really makes it interesting. I think there is not enough action, everything is drama, and it is in the final chapters that it gets interesting. The protagonist is useless, and it's not as if this matters too much. Because I've seen hundreds of anime where the protagonist is useless, but no problem. But Kaneki is one of the worst characters there is, and in the first episode happen the facts. And I think
                  they should have given more time to the development of the story. And this is one of the few interesting things that happened in the episodes, because the following ones felt unnecessary and pathetic, besides that they did not contribute anything. Tokyo Ghoul is very overrated.",6
"
                Ahh Tokyo Ghoul, ironically the first anime I ever watched. A lot of this could be nostalgia talking, but I have watched it 3 or 4 times so I think I'm ok.
Story: 9/10 - I really liked the story in this anime. It kept me interested from beginning to end and the premise was very interesting and executed well.
Art: I really don't care much about art in anime but Tokyo Ghoul's was good
Sound: 9/10 - I mostly base sound on the op and this still has one of my favorite anime openings ever
Character: 9/10 - Characters in this series were rather well done. I actually
                  cared what happened to him and even got a few minor cases of the feels a time or two. Kaneki is kind of annoying I admit, but he kind of grows on you.
Enjoyment 10/10 - This is still one of my favorite animes of all time. I know it gets a lot of flak and there are flaws, but I'm willing to overlook that fact for this series. I really enjoyed it and I would highly recommend it.
BONUS: Watchability - This anime is really really violent. Ghouls literally eat people and there is a lot of blood. not much actual gore though. There is almost no fanservice in the anime, and depending on which sub you find the cursing can vary from only a little, to quite a bit.",10

ENJOYMENT - 9
Resting in the stained world is a personal identity, submerged beneath a pool of liquid blood. In an attempt to block itself from the foul air outside, coagulation transforms the pool into a bloody gel, with identity paralyzed against the high viscosity. This standstill of human existence is the exploration accomplished by Tokyo Ghoul.
My introduction is an analogical take to the complex knot tied between the identity of those who are ghouls and those who are humans. In the dark side of Tokyo, a subworld of survival and predation swarms the city with horrific infestation.
                  And then there was the humans at the federal agency named CCG who hunts down and investigates the ghouls. Now, the story had issues with the inexistent origination of some plot elements. Along with inconsistent pacing, these two failed to flesh out such a compelling world and left out questions behind. It focused more on the fragile human qualities and I have to say, it delivered this aspect quite successfully. Suppose you, a rational person like Kaneki, was turned into a murderous monster who have to eat human fleshes for your own survival. This was not just some ordinary psychological acclimatization where everything will be normal quickly. It's a torturous endurance to keep your sanity intact. To keep your human identity alive. To not be viewed as a hellish organism. And the fact that you were thrown into numerous violent bloodsheds forced yourself to ask questions in the gray areas of morality, straining your mental self with excruciating anguish. While other characters may be undeveloped, they served well to be the resemblances and contrasts to Kaneki. You have ghouls who retained their human values, underpinning a beautiful testament within these so-called demons, and others with unbelievable morbidity who steered away from humanity to become savages. With the CCG investigators who brought in a human perspective, all these sides summed up to an engaging exploration of an inner self who have his identity shattered, a crushed soul attempting to adapt in a divided world.
Fragmented emotions imbued a disarrayed sense of belonging in a world masked by darkness. With the art revitalizing on this purplish darkness along with red gores, the tone managed to grasp a thrilling suspense within the subworld of ghouls versus ghouls and ghouls versus humans. The only slight problem was that the animation looked wonky at times but compared to the ones given for the action scenes, that's minimal. It captured the chaotic but powerful fights with well-made choreography, having splendid movements to go along with them. The designs of the ghouls were monstrous, striking fear with their menacing demonism while also capturing their predatory sides. But a great factor that visually expressed the thematic crisis of identity was in the expressions that ranged from the more horrified to the distressed. Usually backed by the dramatic actions in the characters, it showed the sufferings and tortured emotions from the brutalities they experienced which affected their physical and mental state. Their voices came out disturbingly with intensified sounds and the background music helped even further in turning the atmosphere into a troubled one. It was really effectual in raising up the stakes. Considerable impact was felt and the slight uncomfortableness with goosebumps fitted the horror side. Lastly, the opening may be a simple one but the sequences were a symbolical reflection of ghouls and humans. Accompanied by a phantom-like yet catchy song, the lyrics unraveled the broken human identity, representing the main personal conflicts explored throughout the show.
Tokyo Ghoul is a straightforward but intriguing dive into the mind of a boy with a rotting identity. While the lack of character development and some plot issues did lowered the quality, overall, the various perspectives stitched together into a solid psychological story full of thrills and gory visuals.",8
"
                If I had to describe Tokyo ghoul in two words it would be major disappointment. The only good thing that came out of it was that it made me read the manga after finishing it when I read the reviews complaining about how they changed everything, which only made me hate the anime even more because the manga surprisingly blew me away with how complex it was in almost every aspect. 
Art and animation : I've never really heard many comment on it but it was dreadful. The colours were way too bright and it was just so irritating, and was a terrible contrast to
                  the supposed dark theme of the anime. The animation was done terribly, especially with the kagunes and fight scenes that were just so dull and unengaging, and dont even get me started on the half-assed censoring, I've literally seen anime from the 2000's with better animation when it came to action scenes.
Story : For an anime that was intended to be dark and mysterious, it lacked more depth than a slice of life anime. The whole thing was just so rushed and tried way too hard to be all edgy and depressing, just by having some charecters that I couldn't even bring myself to care for die and the protagonist have a mental breakdown every five seconds. The plot just ended up being so bland and empty, with nothing even making any sense sometimes, every episode would just start off with a new problem without even developing the last. 
Charecters : They were just as dull and generic as the plot. Their personalities felt like they were written at a surface level, with barely any development and only one cliché characteristic that distinguishes them from the rest, which made it hard for me to connect and sympathize with them, aside from the torture scene at the end which is frankly the only scene that was well written, despite still straying away from the manga.
What upsets me the most was the great potential it held to be astounding had it stayed faithful to the manga, and didn't attempt to try and cram around 60 chapters into just 12 episodes that weren't even enjoyable.",3

                ""Whose fault is it that things ended up like this? Coincidence? An accident? Fate? There's no such thing as fate. It's simply a combination of one circumstance and the next. And who is it that creates those circumstances? Who is it? It's you.""
An anime that boomed with popularity during its broadcast, bringing in more individuals to the anime medium. A show that now stands as one of the most recognized with fans and non-fans alike, even outside the anime community.
The story begins with city lights at night. The idea of Ghouls being introduced to the audience. And two mysterious characters having a confrontation that leads
                  to blackness. Fast-forward, and we’re focused on the main character, Kaneki Ken. Just an ordinary, timid teenage school boy. Exciting. I can’t wait to see him develop as a character and realise why the series is so popular even today. Or so I thought. Disappointment coming across my face as soon as I realised within the 12 episodes that was given to me,  Kaneki hasn’t just undergone no significant amount of character development, he also remains as the same annoying coward we saw him as in the beginning. Granted, he obviously becomes a Ghoul and whatnot, but that’s about as much change as it gets when pertaining to his personality as a character. He constantly sobs, constantly bickers with himself because of his cowardly nature, but never attempts to change. It’s not until the very last episode we get to see him accept himself as a Ghoul, but at this point, the show has done me enough to realise that I just don’t like him. Kaneki is just one unlikable guy. I can understand him and his situation. For some reason, he always gets caught up in excruciatingly horrible scenarios. I can at least empathise with him. But there comes a point where you have to say, stop. Just do something, will you? At least give me that satisfaction of seeing you turn into a badass. It’s a shame that never happened. 
As for the other characters, they’re all unsurprisingly parallel to Kaneki. What I mean is, they, too, also remain the same as they were when they were first introduced. More ghouls, more humans, more of the anti-ghoul human association that barely gets explained, all of which never get any kind of focus and when they do, it’s typically for the viewer to “sympathise” with them. Let’s bring in, Amon-kun. His role as the justice-motivated, anti-ghoul human serves up tons of hypocrisy. In the anime, we see his reasoning for killing Ghouls as, “They killed innocent victims, so they should all receive indiscriminate killing”. That’s more or less close to his values. In one scene, he asks himself why the ghouls are targeting him and his friends. An episode or so before, he and his obnoxious partner killed the mother of a Ghoul who sacrificed her life to save her daughter. And he’s still acting like Ghouls are mindless beasts who kill for pleasure. Sheer hypocrisy. Him and Kaneki are easily the most unlikable in the show. The rest of the other characters lack any remarkable aspects in their personalities. While a select few are likable and interesting to watch, the main issue is still present. They don’t evolve whatsoever. They’re just… there. Characters that were shown to be fascinating and deserved growth did not get any at all, and the ones that do are given small amounts of screen time afterwards.
So then, the characters are either bland and empty, or just unlikable overall. The only hope is the engaging plot. Excitement and adrenaline running across your face as each plot point is realised and shown. Unfortunately, with one fell swoop, the story is ultimate left dry because of its pacing. Tokyo Ghoul is effectively rushed because it attempts to adapt so much with so little. There’s far more specific issues that damage the story, with some examples being the conveniently placed in character backstories in dire situations, striking the deus ex machina into the hearts of the characters who are on the edge of giving up. With it, they obtain their resolve and fight, and win. Either that or they use those backstories for us to feel sympathy or elicit some kind of sad reaction. Speaking of combat, the fight scenes are rather nice to look at, but dragged on after some time. Much of it, however, is one-sided, up until a surge of inspiring dialogue changes the tide of battle. Because of the anime’s length, much of the story from the manga is condensed and essentially crushed to a pulp. As a result, its portrayal in this anime adaptation was a complete disappointment. Completely subpar.
With the story being obviously rushed and the studio noticeably cutting out crucial plot points, it’s to no surprise that this is after all a twelve episode adaptation that covers half of the manga.. The only somewhat decent aspect of this show is the Opening and Ending theme. While not being special and noteworthy, they still are a bit nice to listen to, albeit not being the show’s saving grace.
The anime leaves many scenes unattended, forgetting about them and moving on as if it never happened, especially during its final episodes. The whole Kaneki accepting himself as a Ghoul and destroying his enemies in the last moments was disappointing. I mean, the action was great. The music is decent. The amount of gore fits with this type of show. The “horror” aspect communicated well with the audience. But when mentioning the characters and the story, which is what people are typically looking forward to, then... well… it’s safe to assume Tokyo Ghoul doesn’t deal with both in an effective way. As a result, Tokyo Ghoul is a massive letdown, one that proved to be inevitable due to its short length..",3

                Tokyo ghoul is a series in Tokyo with a fantasy element about whats called a ghoul that is similar to a cannibal except it´s someone with a power. The series has an interesting theme because it´s something that hasen´t  been used before and uses a normal ""human"" as the main character. The art work is good but can be scary and brutal at moments though the series. It´s beautiful and an interesting art style. The characters in the series is interesting and enjoyable to watch but also gives the story a life and meaning behind it. The sound is good but does not have
                  all the sound to the actions but that is good sometime though the series but it could give more of a feeling to it if all sound were in Tokyo ghoul.",9
"
                Well, this show epitomizes all style and no substance. 
What it did well: The Art & character designs were very good, and the OP was fantastic. Sound was overall pretty good.
What it did badly: Everything else. Some of the worst characters I have seen were in this anime. All troupes with no depth. Not convincing and no empathy to any of them really. The story was very poorly executed. Interesting premise, and that's about it. The story also ends on a very awkward note, in such a way that it doesn't really end at all - which for me is a major negative. The philosophical
                  questioning was just so lame and unconvincing that it bugged me. The MC was whiny in a way that makes Shinji from Evangelion look like a trouper. And what is up with the amount of crying in this anime? Soo much melodrama, blood and hollow characters; but overall just clunky, awkward and unconvincing in its execution. 
Basically, this Anime sucks. It's a 2 for me in terms of enjoyment, but to be fair to the artwork and sound it bumps up to a 4. It ends even worse than it begins, so if like me you were planning to stick it out because of it being only 12 episodes, you have been warned - it only gets worse.

                Story: Tokyo Ghoul is about high school student Kaneki Ken who finds himself a half-ghoul one day. The story is simple without me spoiling too much... and yet it's one of those rare and complex anime that you won't encounter everyday. Story is a strong point, and how Kaneki-our main protagonist struggle in eating, keeping a friend, and living will literally eat you up. NO PUN INTENDED.
Art: No critiques here. Pierrot knows how to capture an anguish and broken expression of  a character without making us cringe too much(I like my horror to be relatable) and instead shows in depth emotion. The only time
                  the animation would falter would be when a character appear kinda awkward in the background and man is it DOPE!! Haha.. my excuse but when you notice it, it doesn't really matter and makes for a rather good laugh. SERIOUSLY, IT'S UNNOTICEABLE.
Sound: Here is where we arrive at my favorite spot. Music.. ah, music fills my ears with happiness or in this case it's the opening of Tokyo Ghoul. Unravel is by far maybe the most catchiest song you'll ever hear and you can disagree..(please don't) but have at it. I also enjoy the ending sequence.. while squealing at the art- I didn't explain but the art at the ed is pure awesomeness. 
Character: It's a bit of a hit and miss with some of the characters. While the story started off with a generic character getting into a unexpected situation, it dives off from the norm and makes us insane with the characters. Kaneki-book worm kid, Touka-tsundere at any cost, Tsukiyama- Man who sniffs-things-too-much-for-his-own-good, and finally hide- the always supportive but lonesome friend who more or less should appear more but doesn't. There are more but I wouldn't want to bore you so let's get on. I should also say these are the characters that also lack in the development area... just letting you know.
Enjoyment: Tokyo Ghoul let me just say isn't just great it's awesome and for what it sought out to do, it did right. If I had to say what appears to be bad, it's going to be the character development.. like I said before, some of the characters are a hit-and-miss to viewers and going into a twelve episode anime covering about 70 chapters isn't easy, and perhaps the censoring, so maybe now's a good time to look up the characters before watching. Hehe.. nervous laugh.
Overall: I rated Tokyo Ghoul a nine, which is pretty high and as high as I'll go...(sassy, but right) anyway, with Tokyo Ghoul it's easily a watchable anime despite the gore, and let's say that everything was censored so you're gonna have an easy time watching. My opinion with the anime adaption is pretty high, but I would like to see a better adaption true to the manga oneday. That's all I have time for today and I'll leave some suggestion as to what you might want to try.",9
"
                I want to start by saying I am bias towards this show as it was one of the first anime I watched when I got started in 2014.
Overall the story and the show is amazing. Following Kaneki along his journey of turning into and accepting the world of ghouls is a ride worth taking. You get to see him slowly except the things he has to do to survive while also fighting with his inner demons.
The amount of character development done is jaw dropping as he builds new relationships and starts to understand the hardships ghouls have to go through compared to the hardships humans
                  go though.
Along with this the fight/action scenes mixed into the show help to further the character development and show just how much kaneki is changing as a character.
I highly recommend the show for anyone looking for a show with a unique premise and who likes to watch a show's MC develop over the course of the series.",10
"
                This show is nothing of mediocre. I didn't really feel excitement watching it. So for me it just felt mediocre not the best not the worst, right in the middle and some scenes are strange... The characters are fine they never really got me at the edge of my seat. Just a normal piece of media! At least the episodes didn't feel long or stretched out. It doesn't stand out its just something to watch for fun. I don't really recommend it. the other seasons were not anything new too I just had to tank through it. But hey at least the music is iconic.

                In this Anime, the story takes place in Tokyo, Japan, by all main characters live in Tokyo which means all factions include human, Ghouls and ""Mystery groups who holding a bag"".
The story emphasising in reality that can make audiences were so into and moved by the main idea of story about the society of Ghouls, human and holding bag's group...
In this story is kind of mystery balance with action and drama (however, because this story includes dark fantasy style, so it will also has some gloomy or dark points).
In this story, will unfold Ghouls' being in their society, their lifestyle, also their thought and obstacles
                  in their life which all of it were formed and has meaning of life in it.
For humans' view, Ghouls are horrific...For polices' view, Ghouls are useless living thing for society, also harm and danger...And, within Ghouls society, they are separated as many kinds of them which includes friendship, family, respect person, also the hater and enemies...
In my opinion after finished this Anime, author would like to inform that Tokyo Ghoul was the first dark fantasy Anime for me. To tell the truth, author felt a little frighten with unexpected blood scenes (and a bit haunted) because of the first scene began with such a beautiful scenery of Tokyo from high view (which, in this story created quite a beautiful graphic).
Around the introduction part, it was rather a serious in my opinion because it has twisted plot that make audiences moved by those characters with stress and confuse at the same time with them...When author was continue watching it, the story presented more deep details in a new social as ""Ghoul's society"" . At this point, the story starting to represents social reflects that human's society separated with Ghoul's society, also presents severe aggressive fights without any investigation or scrutiny.
One clearly consideration point is, in every societies have both good and bad person. Non society that has only good people, likewise, non of society which has merely bad people...
Overall, some fighting scenes maybe too severe, by contrast, there are many scenes that avoid clearly severe scenes, just to let audiences know what's happened. If any readers would like to try dark fantasy anime, may try this one because this story has it's own advantage that make audiences would like to follow. Furthermore, this first season completed with such an exciting ending that the main character had a great change.",8

                This anime follows a normal boy who get mixed up in a world that he can not understand. there are 2 types of beings humans and ghouls , ghouls have to eat humans or other ghouls to stay alive but Kaneki the main protagonist is a little bit special he is a human who get a ghoul transplanted in to him after an accident making him half human half ghoul. The problem is he needs to eat human flesh but can't make him self do it because he is still part human so he teams up with a group of ghouls to solve this problem.
                  After this a lot happens but i can assure u that the anime never stops being interesting.
I found this anime great and overall i give it a 8/10.
If u like gore , action , drama and horror then this is an anime for u hope u enjoy it !!",8

                I've always been interested in Tokyo Ghoul. It's something that I've been hearing from my friend who is a huge fan of it, and for a while I've been thinking about giving it a shot. I picked up the first volume of the manga when I was at MomoCon last year, but never had the time to read it. I then picked up the first season last month after Christmas after seeing it on sale. A month later and here we are. So how is Tokyo Ghoul: The Anime? Apparently its been the talk of the town back in 2014 but forgotten after that. What
                  happened?
Let's go to the beginning. I will admit, I was liking the anime at first. The action and story got me genuinely hooked into it. I was actually having a good time with it. True the characters didn't really click to me than I thought they would (minus Touka best goth gf don't @ me), but at least I was enjoying with it. Well...the first half at least.
Then after that, the second half just takes a tumble out of nowhere and then the problems start to show. I've heard many people say that the problem with the anime is how they crammed all 60 chapters of the manga into a short 12 episode anime. And they're right sadly. This felt rather rushed with its story. Even coming from some who hasn't read a lot of the manga, it obviously shows. The pacing goes out of nowhere around the latter half of the show, making the flow of the plot feel out of focus. I think the real kicker is the final episode. Don't get me wrong, the episode had some gruesome but good moments as well. But once the episode ended, I literally said ""That's it?"" It's obvious its just set up for the sequel and it did a poor job at doing it.
The animation is good, I will give them that. From the dark and gloomy backgrounds to the design of the ghouls fit the tone pretty well. Tokyo Ghoul is a dark anime and it works well in this scenario. The soundtrack is possibly the best part of the show. Much like with others, I enjoyed the OP and credits song. But I also liked the shows score as well in the episodes. Much like with the animation, it fits the show well. 
Characters though...eh. Minus Touka and I guess Juuzou, I didn't really care a whole lot for the characters. Including Kaneki. Either because we didn't get a lot of time to focus on them or I just lost interest due to how, well, rushed the character development were handled.
And that's the word to describe the first season of Tokyo Ghoul. It felt rushed. Like it had a deadline to get out so it can still maintain its hype. But hype can kill something as well. It's not a terrible anime, but it is rather disappointing to say the least.  It's weak at certain points, but the action makes up for it. Sadly, it doesn't make up that much and all we got was a decent, but disappointing, anime. Will √A improve on the problems I had with this season? Only time will tell. And honestly, I'm probably going to enter it with some low expectations.",6
"
                Absolute huge pile of dog shit. I have no idea whatsoever how this piece of crap actually got any thing past the first season or why the pilot was approved in the first place. The only reason I put enjoyment at a 2 is because I laughed once at how bad it is. From the story to the character this anime never ceased to amaze me when it came down to how many people actually like this. This isn't even an opinion at this point. Me saying Tokyo Ghoul is bad is a fact and an upsetting one at that. Because this show was that
                  bad I had to drop it. I LITERALLY couldn't get past the 7th episode and the only reason I got that far is because I watched it with friends so we could all jest at the appalling quality of Tokyo Ghoul. And why is there a soft core pedophile who wants to commit cannibalism on the main character?",1
"
                After a first date gone horribly wrong Ken Kaneki, a mild-mannered (read ‘boring’) 19-year-old college student, finds himself transformed into a flesh eating being known as a ‘ghoul’. 
In the universe Kaneki inhibits ghouls exist alongside with humans, only hidden. 
With his new and unwanted transformation Kaneki needs to learn to walk the fine line between controlling his urges and blending in with humans — a task which proves to be much harder than it sounds: ghouls fighting over territory and special human police force set on killing every single ghoul in Tokyo prevent our young protagonist from staying hidden in the sidelines. Kaneki realizes
                  (at some point) he must learn to embrace his new inner violent side to defend the people he loves and cares for. 
I hated this show. I think I’m one of the few people who did. The never ending fighting arcs, Kaneki’s whinny weak persona, the annoying supporting characters who are either angry, whinny, over-dramatic, or useless… It was all too much for me.  
It is only in the very last episode of the show that things start looking up, but seriously, who has the patience to go through nearly 300 minutes to only see some progress in the final 10?
Uta the mask-maker, the ending song, and Rize are the only redeeming elements of this show. To be honest, even the art work is not that great…
Tokyo Ghoul is Deadman Wonderland meets Outrage.",5
"
                I have read that the manga is a better portray of the story, that the show drifts away from it... I don't know, i haven't read the manga, although i totally gonna read it after i have watched. 
Being said that, i am a big fan of supernatural in modern days settings. Tokyo Ghoul does it the good way and plays carefully with the trope of normal guy ends in the underworld, presenting the characters and lore slowly as the show moves forward. The pace is good, yet lets space and moments to the characters to develop.
This anime took me by surprise, i wasn't expecting
                  something good. I was expecting a meh show, to disconnect a bit. I was mistaken, the show is great and i recommend it.
Looking forward to go deeper.
1.- The characters are sympathetic and have they're own motivations 
2.- The lore is good
3.- The setting is appealing but it should be more dark and gloomy
4.- The fights are anime-standard but are good",8

                The anime that introduced me into this world was Dragon Ball, the doors opened.
The anime that made me decide too continue too look further and watch over 2000 episodes of anime...is Tokyo Ghoul.
Basically this series is the prelude to all that i know today in terms if Anime/Manga.
If it wasn't for this series i might have just dropped it. Thank you so much Tokyo Ghoul for giving me 2000+ epsiodes of pure fun and entertainment.
The universe is intense and dark, it is decisive. The struggle is unbearable and right in your face. The characters are lovable and relatable.
Season 1 of Tokyo Ghoul is the definiton
                  of pain. But in some wierd way it is almost portrayed in a beautyful way, almost like it is meant to be. If it wasn't for the struggles, Kaneki would not be who he is today.
Kaneki is one of the very few protagonists i envy and at the same time despice. His character development is somewhat of perfection and for me captivating and pure. The voice actors/effects are at the highest peak of hentai and all the way from production too storyline is a masterpiece.
it is a work of art, it is the pioneer of darkness. Succumb to it and be amased, mesmerized by it as you should.
This is basically not a review.
It is just me saying that if you're missing out on this adventure you are missing out on life itself.",10
"
                *THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER*
Tokyo Ghoul is one of the most famous anime out there so why am I even recommending it when most of you have probably watched it? This time round I am not recommending the anime but the manga. Tokyo Ghoul's anime had a huge hype when its seasons started to air and everyone had high expectations from the new but as the episodes started airing, it was obvious that the anime had taken a wrong course. There were many confusions among the fans regarding Hide's death, Kaneki's sudden changes and many more. Nothing made any sense anymore and the people started dropping
                  the anime because it was not gripping as it had been earlier because of all the confusion. I was going through the same confusion but I decided to finish off the anime and then picked up the manga because I was super curious about everything and as expected, manga was awesome.
It saddened me to see some of my friends dropping the show and not bothering to read it because the anime lacked important things. The manga provided evidences and substantial plot and character development. There were many arcs that were left out in the anime which were amazingly illustrated in the manga. The sudden appearances and disappearances of the characters made much more sense when I got hold of the real plot. The manga also did a wonderful job in showing the antagonistic features in the characters. The main antagonist, Furuta, was not given a proper spotlight in the anime but in the manga, he came off as a great villain whom I really appreciated. The action scenes are really well described and the emotional element is balanced wonderfully with its dark concept.
Speaking about the manga's art, I liked it. Simple as that because it was nothing special and is a common art style but beautiful as well. There are some panel which I personally found to be absolutely amazing especially those which showed their kagune. They might have a complex design but looks really good. In the end, if you have dropped Tokyo Ghoul, make sure to pick up its manga this time because it will absorb you in its fantastic story of suspense and thrill from the first page itself.",10
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is typically the kind of anime I can't recommand to anyone, and especially not to someone new to anime. The whole show is like a caricature, a wrong idea about what an anime actually can be. 
Now don't get me wrong though : 
It's still a carefully crafted animation, with nice effects (motion and lights, especially) and a good emphasis towards action scenes and rhythm.
But you will find these traits are also quite common ... in a good TV commercial, which is to me the definition of Tokyo Ghoul : an pitiful marketing product.  
I'm honestly unsure about what you could gain
                  from watching this anime. To me, there lies Tokyo Ghoul biggest flaw : directed like some kind of a blockbuster advertisement, this anime fails to provide any kind of answers to the few deep questions it brings up with its lazy story, while the pseudo-cliché characters afflicted by emptiness are not exactly helping either.
So to summarize it all, Tokyo Ghoul is not a good anime, in my opinion, because I can only find some artistic and entertainment values almost exclusively in its visuals and FX : 
Everything else, such as plot, character development, depth, and so on, falls short.
Maybe this anime still deserves a bit better than the crushing score I gave it. And the best way for you to ensure I'm wrong is to actually watch the show (poor you), but then I would still highly recommand that you don't expect too much of this anime : along the way, unfortunately, watching each episode becomes a futility exercice, and trying to make sense of the show in its whole, a gageure.",1
"
                *** I have not kept up with the manga since Vol. 4; as a result, I won’t be able to accurately judge how well this stands as an adaptation past that point. Instead I’ll primarily be rating it on how it stands as an anime in general ***
Tokyo Ghoul is a title familiar to every anime fan, and for good reason. First starting out as a manga spanning 12 volumes, it has since been adapted into two seasons, as well as recently receiving an adaptation of its sequel Tokyo Ghoul:re by the same name. 
Set in modern-day Tokyo, flesh-eating humanoids known as ghouls lurk in
                  the shadows, blending in with the general populace and trying their best to evade the CCG, a vicious organization tasked with hunting them. 
                                                         PLOT
If I had to describe Tokyo Ghoul in only five words, they would be: Date night gone horribly wrong. And no, it’s not the oops-I-spilled-wine-all-over-my-date’s-expensive-tuxedo kind of wrong; more like the oh-shit-i-just-got-turned-into-a-ghoul kind of wrong. We’re introduced to a young boy named Ken Kaneki, who wakes up in the hospital after a date night from hell and finds himself turned into a half-ghoul, half-human. Through the remainder of the episodes, we get to see him wage an internal battle with the beast inside him, refusing to accept what he's become, all the while his struggles are overshadowed by the even larger war brewing between his fellow ghouls and those who want them dead.
Really, there aren't any complaints I have about this storyline. It's solid and while not totally original, still extremely captivating. However, as I'll touch on in the next section, the story and some of its aspects seem rushed, and that's due to shoving too many chapters and story arcs into a short amount of time.
                                                    CHARACTERS
                                             *slight spoilers ahead*
First off, I’d like to address the “too many characters, so little time” issue. TG is one of the more robust animes in terms of characters, and while that isn’t necessarily a problem in general terms, I consider it one in this case. 12 episodes is not a lot of time to get the audience to familiarize themselves and sympathize with such a large and colorful cast. In the third episode, we are introduced to not one, not two, but five new characters. Then, three episodes later, one of them dies horribly. Now, I can’t remember if this occurs in the manga within the same amount of time as well; but goodness gracious, that’s a bit too much, too fast. Clearly, as is the case with so many other anime adaptations, this is the result of the studio mashing together a ton of chapters within a time constraint of only a few episodes.
As for the actual characters and their personalities, Ken Kaneki is… well, let’s cut to the chase— he’s the personification of a doormat. Now, I get it; he isn't like that forever, and sure, he grows some balls at the end (even if it was the result of enduring terrible trauma) but holy shit, I couldn't help but want to smack some sense into the poor kid's head. He's also incredibly gullible. If some flamboyant weirdo with lavender hair and a skewed sense of fashion came to you out of the blue and attached themselves to you, would you be so apt to entertain their company? Kaneki sure does! He even agrees without any hesitation to go to with him to the place he claims is Touka’s favorite hangout spot—which we all now know isn’t the case. You barely know this man, what the fuck are you doing?
And don’t even get me started on Juuzou Suzuya. He's probably the singular most overrated character I've ever seen. I’m not sure if it’s the dub actor that threw me off or what, but holy shit, I’ve never disliked a character more than his. He’s just so… edgy, but the cheesy kind of edgy. Yes, I already know his backstory and why he is the way he is; but still, he’s just so unlikeable. 
Overall, TG offers a wide variety of different characters. I don’t have many objections to any of them (except the aforementioned ones), and while they’re all quite interesting (yes, even those in the CCG), the anime doesn’t do a great job of expanding on each one of them. Again, if the studio hadn’t decided to put out so few episodes, we would have gotten that character development and we wouldn’t be having this discussion.
                                                          ART
        I adored the art in this, honestly. The muted tones mixed with the vibrant reds and purples was very aesthetically pleasing, and though the style is on the simplistic end, there are some scenes where the character designs and details really manage to shine. 
— Overall Rating: 6/10
— Pros: Nice-looking art; solid soundtrack (Unravel is perhaps one of my favorite OPs, despite my dislike of the band who sang it); attention-grabbing plot. 
— Cons: Not enough character development, and what we did get is watered down; too few episodes, leading to a rushed story and not enough time to catch a breath.",6

                I've gotten a lot of recommendations on this anime since several of my friends have watched it, and I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. However, while Tokyo Ghoul was certainly a pleasure to watch, it still has its flaws and is a bit insubstantial in comparison to the manga.
Story: 9
Tokyo Ghoul tells the story of Kaneki Ken, a young boy of 18 who after an accident goes through dramatic changes and becomes half-ghoul. It really raises the question of who is truly good or evil, since you see a lot of the perspectives in this show. However, my problem with this is that it pushes out
                  room for proper character development by either showing no difference in character at all or by simply skipping over what could really be quite valuable.
Art: 8
The art style is certainly unique since it attempts to follow slightly more realistic human proportions. That being said, it's still anime and the typical shiny eyes are toned down in size a by a bit. It's an interesting art style that I find suits the show very well. The only thing that's really worth criticizing is most likely the fact that it's a much more simplified version of the completely outstanding manga art style. The animation is fairly smooth and lip-syncing is decent.
Sound: 10
The soundtrack was really fitting for the show and fantastic. The opening, ""Unravel"" is really beautiful because of its quickening pace and the soft vocals that gradually grow more emotion, until the end where the song finally calms down again and the singer is soft and breathy once more (making it sound like they've finished crying, but still it somehow fits). Also, ""Licht und Schatten"" is one of the quieter and much more emotion-provoking pieces of the soundtrack.
Character: 8
Like I said before on the story, I mentioned that character development wasn't handled that well. Does that mean that I found the characters unlikable? No. I found them to be quite relatable and while they all did have very sad backstories, it was portrayed in such a way that they seemed to move on and raised sympathy for the character. A lot of people call out Kaneki for being ""wimpy"" in his denial to his ghoul side at first, but I actually find him to be very relatable in his fears.
Enjoyment:9
 I did really like this anime when I was watching it, and I really liked the way the universe was developed. However I still feel that the anime adaption still has some plot holes in terms of logic, however either those were explained in the manga or I enjoyed the rest of the show too much to really complain.
Overall: 9
In spite of Tokyo Ghoul's flaws I really did find this anime to be well done. So, for those of you who are looking for a seinen anime that's come out recently, I would recommend this to you.",9
"
                A lot of users seem to dislike this anime for various reasons of which I find irrelevant. Comparing one show to another is like comparing one human to another; each one is different and has its own unique points that make it entertaining to watch. 
I completely disagree with the other reviews on Tokyo Ghoul. To me there is a certain amount of symbolism behind Tokyo Ghoul itself that makes it different than any other anime I've watched.
There is a massive amount of character development and backstory written into Tokyo Ghoul. I will touch on this in a spoiler section below so others will know
                  what I'm talking about, but I will still attempt to keep spoilers at a minimum.
The artwork wasn't necessarily my favorite in the beginning, but then I realized that while the anime style isn't exactly what I'm used to I could definitely get used to it.
I even found myself adoring it, and as I'm currently on the third season I find myself preferring the artwork of the first! 
The sound is quite possibly my favorite part of the anime. The way that Unravel was written fits the anime so perfectly that I find myself enveloped in the feeling of watching the anime all over again when I listen to it.

______________________MILD SPOILERS BELOW ____________
I found that there was a ton of symbolism just in the opening theme. I typically hate rock songs but found myself enraptured by the song the longer I watched the anime. 
The subtle nuances and comparisons of our reality to the world of Tokyo Ghoul were what made me fall in love with the series. 
When you begin to realize all of the philosophical attributes is when you really 'get' this anime. 
The world of Tokyo Ghoul is set to model our own, with the CCG being both a police task force to control ghouls and keep peace within the city, yet they also serve as a sort of national defense against 'monsters' who attempt to harm the city. 
The anime often gives references to how modern militaries are structured, which makes me feel as though it's alluding to the militaries of countries. 
The anime itself has a theme of 'it doesn't matter what circumstances you have, a sin is a sin.' What I mean by this is the Ghouls are often persecuted for eating which they need to survive. They have no choice in the matter, and ghouls like Kaneki and the others from Anteiku choose not to kill live humans but instead eat those who have already passed away. This shows that not all ghouls prefer to harm others, and it's quite possible that many other ghouls feel the same way and only do so out of necessity. Yet ghouls are relentlessly hunted to hopeful extinction by the CCG out of fear.
To me, this alludes to modern day militaries who hunt those who feel commit wrongdoings. We all believe we are in the right and justified and tell ourselves that we are just that by using our circumstances. Tokyo Ghoul teaches that regardless of the reasons why you do something if you kill, you are a killer. If you lie, you are a liar. Circumstances don't matter in the eyes of the world, which is a harsh reality many people have yet to face. 
Now onto my final point I wanted to touch on before I go on to watch the third season. 
The true beauty of Tokyo Ghoul is the way that it captures both sides of the equation and leaves you with a caught feeling. I found myself unable to root for either side to win, because either way I knew someone that the Anime had brought me to love would die. The anime captures each side so well I'm unable to tell who the heroes and villains are, which to me is the true masterpiece of the anime.",10
"
                I remember hearing a lot of good things a bout this anime a few years back and never really looked into detail about any reviews and just decided to give it a watch now.
I want to talk specifically about the way the story is executed. Not even specifically about character development. I want to talk about details. 
In this anime there will be a surprising amount of occasions a detail about a situation is completely skipped and a character just wakes up the next day as if the events from the previous episodes never happened.
So many ghouls get effectively beaten to death and stabbed in
                  the heart, yet it's never shown if they die or not, its never explained if they have regenerative abilities or not, except for a single side comment made in the final episode. Then you see that ghoul alive 3 episodes later with NO explanation at all.
There are 2 occasions where life and death enemies in one episode are effectively friends by the next episode and no time or character development is put into showing  the transition of that relationship, or even really justifying why it should happen. No one forgives that easily.
They never explain what a ward is, yet spend the whole series talking about them. Some weird government war is initiated in the last 2 episodes with no explanation as to why. Some trap pickpocket appears on a motorcycle with no explanation or exposition. The MC's teammates trying to save him don't even turn up in the final episode. It's just one big cliffhanger for the next season which because it was so bad I don't even want to watch now.
And then they try to pull some moral lesson shit at the end about MC's guilt related mommy issues or something.",4
"
                I will start by saying that if anyone is on the fence about this one I would personally recommend to just go for it. The plot execution is lacking in more than a few ways, but I found myself fascinated and gripped for the entire 12 episodes.
Story: 7
On one hand, I like how they tried to combine various themes in it, in a dystopian setting. Gore and thrillers are fine with me, and right from the first episode I was really hyped up for what was going to come next. But I do remember watching the second episode and asking if it's actually just the
                  second episode I'm watching because so much is going on, which should shed light on how fast the pacing was. When watching I didn't really find it a huge problem though, it's only when I thought back on it and felt like it was a bit too crammed. The world-building was not done well, but to be honest while watching it I could dismiss the fast pacing and lack of background explanation because I was immersed in the story.
The plot isn't entirely that original but it was pretty well thought out, there were some plot holes in places like what many people think, and I do agree that given more time/episodes the story could have progressed much better with more details. I still like how the story went though, disregarding the execution.
Art: 7
Censors... but other than that no big flaws. Character designs were also amazing.
Sound: 8
Loved the opening! Sound effects are pretty on point too.
Character: 8
Character development was not really emphasized due to the pace of the story, so not all important supporting characters were able to fully flesh out. That said, I really enjoyed the theme of humans and ghouls and sub-existence, and while I did recall grunting baka at Kaneki a few times, it was still very enjoyable watching him change and grow bit by bit. Quite a few of the other ghouls were fascinating characters as well but like I said, there just weren't enough time for them to fully develop. I hate Mado and Amon with a passion, however - before a certain turn in the story I was okay with watching them (just needed to slap the table a couple of times), but then afterwards it just got plain annoying. I understand their ideals and 'sense of justice', but let's just say my rationale doesn't work when Mado is involved. Whenever he started talking I had to hold back to urge to fast forward. Hypocrites don't sit very well with me. 
The last couple of episodes solidified the character development a bit more, and the last episode sealed the deal for me for reasons I will touch upon in the next section. I do wish we'd seen more of Hide though, he's too likeable a character.
Enjoyment: 10
I think this is where Tokyo Ghoul really shone for me. Even though there were glaring faults with the plot, the pacing, the execution and whatnot, it didn't fail to grab my attention from the first episode to the last. I finished this season in one sitting, and it was pretty much an emotional rollercoaster. I just really want to mention that the last episode did things to me emotionally that no other story had done before. I was digging my nails really hard into my arms and literally felt like I had to cover my ears to stop listening because it was really emotionally scarring and intense. That's how engrossed it made me. 
Technically and rationally the ending wasn't a good one for the season: too many loose strings, too much of a cliffhanger, etc, but the emotional impact it had on me was huge, and well, psychologically speaking there is the peak-end effect, so since I was so impressed with that ending I had to give enjoyment a 10. It's not really that I enjoyed watching him suffer (or enjoy having to suffer through watching him suffer in fact) but I don't know where else to rate how strong of an impact this had on me upon its conclusion. 
Hatred breeds hatred. Hatred can make a strong person weak, and a weak person strong. Of all the themes that screamed at me in Tokyo Ghoul, 'hate' is one that made the most lasting impression. I might change my mind about the anime after catching up to the manga (which I am determined to do so), but at this moment the impact is really quite strong, and these are the conclusions I came to in order to sort out a review.",8
"
                Story: The story stars off with main character Ken Kaneki who is pretty much your average college student. He enjoys reading most of all and Is interested in a certain girl that goes to the same college. Only problem is Ken finds himself in a dangerous situation, where he finds out the girl he has feelings for is actually a ghoul and A accident involving some things here and there as well as surgery, turns Ken Kaneki into this Human/Ghoul Hybrid. In this anime Humans and Ghouls fight each other, as they can not co-exist with each other. Ghouls survive by devouring humans and Humans
                  must protect themselves from the ghouls that prey on them. 
Art: Coming form the same studio that created Bleach and Yu Yu Hakusho, you'd assume that the animation for this anime was going to be average at best. Turns out the animation is actually pretty good compared to Bleach and Yu Yu Hakusho, which didn't have the best animation at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Sound: The intro theme "" Unravel "" by TK is actually perfect for this anime. The lyrics tell you what the story is like and What the main characters feel while being on the border of being Human and Ghoul. The instruments play a track that goes perfect with the downpour of rain and This feeling is what makes the track sound Sad and Understanding. As for the Ending theme "" Saints "" by People In The Box has a really chillax vibe that follows up on the ending of the anime and It follows up extremely well. At first I didn't like the two themes cause they weren't at all hyped up or Something you'd play a t a party, but Not all anime intros/outros have to have a hyped up sense of emotion and Not all parties are meant for drinking/smoking. Weebs party as well.
Character Development: Character development was possibly the worst thing within this anime. I felt that the main character Ken Kaneki was just this selfish entitled brat and The fact that it took majority of season 1 for him to get over his whole Human/Ghoul personalities from clashing over and over again was ridiculous. It shouldn't take someone eight or ten episodes to decide what they are. In Kens case, he was either Human or Ghoul . all he had to do was choose one side and That was it, but No. It takes him a whole season to figure himself out and That's just ludicrous.  
Personal Enjoyment: At first I thought I was going to dislike the anime since lots of people actually hated the anime and Hated the main character even more, but After watching the anime I made up my mind and Decided that I did like the anime. I believe the anime is good and I enjoyed it very much to the point where I hated some characters and Some characters I loved. At one point I was in a hateful relationship with Tokyo Ghoul and Now I love it. Which proves that you should always watch something before having someone judge it for you. I love everything about Tokyo Ghoul except the character development. 
Overall: I highly recommend watching Tokyo Ghoul as the anime is indeed good and If you haven't seen it, then you should give it a chance. I regret not watching it for as long as I did and Now that I've seen it I am glad I did. 
I rate Tokyo Ghoul a 7 OUT OF 10
Tokyo Ghoul is GOOD
Pros:
Great Artstyle.
Great Intro/Outro
Good Story 
Cons:
Decent Character Development
Main Character is So and So",7

                Ah, Tokyo Ghoul. I have a love-hate relationship with this anime, for numerous reasons. And it was time I tackled this meaty wall of an anime and move on.
Do keep in mind that there may be a couple negatives here and there, so feel free to ignore and pass them off as, personal preferences. So let's dive in, shall we?
Story - 8 - Honestly, I kinda liked the story. It was fresh, original and very well written. Kinda like I was reading an award-winning book. Last time I read a good book was 'Percy Jackson series', 'Oliver Twist' and 'Dracula'. There may be other anime
                  which features a story about how monsters and humans are not so different, but this one does it well. That isn't to say it was executed right. I heard a lot of rumors about how the sequel tripped very badly, and I thought I smelled controversy over a certain 'something'. (Were getting there, don't worry)
Speaking of which, What happened to the ghouls in New York? Why only Tokyo? Did they all get killed from eating too much red meat? What about China? Did they get the wrong end of the fortune cookie (I know they're Japanese)? What about Dhaka- OH WAIT, We already have plenty of those lying around, WISHING THEY WERE NEVER BORN.
Art - 6 - It's awesome. Nuff said. The artwork and the character design may be the highlight of the entire series. The characters look gorgeous, and the action scenes are damn good...................THEN WHY THE HELL DID I GIVE IT A 6?!?!?!
This is where I address the controversial part of the anime - the censoring.
You might have heard that Kangoku Gakuen (Prison School) also had the same treatment. So I did a little digging, and from what I found, Funimation licensed both of them. So my theory might be that they wanted to censor the gore and color the blood red and black (Come on guys, Crona already proved to be a failure, DON'T DRAG THE GHOULS INTO THIS!!!). Apparently, they thought it was too much for the viewers to handle (Did you guys even watch Elfen Lied? That anime has enough gore to make Mortal Kombat look like a PG rated sitcom). The scenes are so heavily censored that I can't even enjoy the anime at all. Most of the time, I'm trying to figure out what the hell I was looking  at. What is she eating? What is THAT? Is Tsukiyama having an orgasm or a boner?
My main problem with the series is that the censoring can really erk you and get in the way of the art and ruin it altogether.Hopefully, you will forgive me for giving the art a 6, but now that you know why, let's move on!
Sound - 7 - The OST is pretty good, and fits the series very well. Funny coming from someone who doesn't pay THAT much attention to OST. The OP is beautiful and the graphics used was stunning.
As for the Seiyuu, I watched it in subs. And I have to hand it to them, it was good. Especially Kaneki's voice actor, who perfectly portrayed a boy who went from a human to monster very well (Even though he was whiny most of the time [GET IN THE DAMN ROBOT, SHINJI!!!]). And let's not forget Tsukiyama's seiyuu, whose voice stole the show, and creeped the living #@$*!&% out of me.
Character - 8 - As for the characters they were all great. Everyone had a role to play in the tragic tale of Ken Kaneki, from the maniacal psycho-bitch, Rize, to the ghoul who was killed while having lunch in the first episode (He was my 4th favourite character, because he resembled the author of the manga. You shall be remembered :-((). Even the antagonist's characters were phenomenal. We had a psycho human AND a psycho ghoul. They both clearly show the flaws of both sides of the story, and those flaws are what made them who they are. Ghouls aren't monsters, they were monsters because WE called them monsters. Humans are monsters because we try to eliminate those 'monsters' without hearing THEIR side of the story. As for whose my first favourite, I may put up a blog about it.
Enjoyment - 7 - All in all, it was a good anime...........is what I would've said, if it hadn't been for the censoring. Yeah, the story was good, the animation was great, the soundtrack was cool. But the censoring is what bogged them down. This may be the first time I watched an good anime get bogged down by censoring. It's like Mortal Kombat on the SNES, or Hentai, but with no sex and the closest thing there is, IS A #@$*!&% PANTY SHOT!!! I'm sorry, THAT'S NOT HENTAI, IT'S ECCHI!!!
Overall - 7 - Sorry if the review took too long. I had so much to say about the positives and the negatives, that I just couldn't stop myself. Even my wordy fetish didn't have it's fill.
Should I recommend it? Well, that depends on your preferences. I suppose you're better off reading the manga. It has all the same perks, but no censors. Looking back, I guess I should give 'Tokyo Ghoul: Re' a read.",7
"
                Wow, do I regret not finishing this anime sooner.  When Tokyo Ghoul first started, I was intrigued by the plot, and surprised by the level of gore.  It was interesting to watch Ken struggle with his new found Ghoulish nature.  It wasn't the strongest of anime starts, but it was good enough to keep me watching.  That is, until I got to the ""Gourmet"" arc and I totally lost interest.  The Gourmet is such an irritating and over-the-top villain, one of those flamboyant homosexuals that irritate both straight and gay people.  His ridiculous antics and mannerisms just kind of
                  turned me off big time and made me lose interest as the anime started to feel more cartoonish than like an anime.
I powered through those ridiculous episodes, and was willing to go forward, but then when I was hit with a flashback episode right after that, with how Amou and Mado met, that was all she wrote and I tapped out and only just returned now after four years.  Man, do I regret that.  Because after the MC meets Jason, well, the anime takes on a much more intense vibe.  I feel safe to say that, that is the most insane way to shift a character from a sniveling irritant to a beast, I've ever seen in anime.  
The final episode is how you finish off a season correctly.  Too many animes today choose a tepid finish to angle for a second season.  They don't really blow your mind.  The end of this season was the exact opposite.  It's not something I'll ever forget.  
However, that doesn't mean that one can gloss over the flaws of this anime, just because the final episode was the bomb.  There's a large cast, but half of the characters feel undefined, somewhat empty, with the exception of Touka and Amon.    The other half are way over the top, like Jason, Shuu (The Gourmet) and Rico.  This blend of ""meh"" characters with the blend of explosive ones, kind of messed with the flow of the anime.  It made it feel somewhat less realistic than it should have.  
There were also logic gaps in the anime, but I won't go into that too much so as not to spoil.  But, a huge issue was that they just kind of rushed into the Aogiri Three storyline out of nowhere.  Just, suddenly, the ""organized movements"" mentioned early in the anime are pushed to the back, until boom, we're suddenly at war.  And during this war, Ken is being created over a course of what seems like days and weeks, but apparently happened in just a few hours?  I don't really know, the pacing was off.   
But, as I already mentioned, the episodes with Shuu were just kind of a momentum killer.  That was my biggest problem with the anime.  Still, the ending has me going immediately into season 2.  The ending was truly nuts.

                It definitely differs from the original manga series in so many ways. But I am not here to compare this anime and the original manga of course. 
When I first started watching this series, I was instantly hooked into it's amazing animation and soundtrack and personality of the characters. I consider this anime to be a very tragic and psychological type. As someone who loves emphasizing with characters and relating them to my own works of mind in real life, I found that highly enjoyable and enhancing in my experience of watching Tokyo Ghoul. Yes, and it is actions too. The fight scenes, although can
                  be very violent at times, are eye-catching and bring out the intensity of the anime. The protagonist's emotional and actual journey although tragic, is very compelling and interesting. By the time I finished the anime (and read the original manga too), I could feel new ways to describe my own emotions and it challenged the way I think what is right and wrong to me and what the deepest aspects of reality are.",10
"
                I give this highly ranked score; don't care what others say negatively about it. It's a creative story line along with characters. It mainly comes down to friendship and protecting those you love; which seems like a more typical story line, but it was done in a very creative way. At first I thought that Kaneki was a bit boring, being a submissive and recluse person but it heated up quickly! 
I love the dynamic of a half-ghoul. Kaneki battled with himself and ultimately gave into his ghoul side to be stronger and protect his family by any means necessary. The anime has a lot
                  of gore which is nice. I don't see it as often as I'd like since I'm no longer a little kid. I want to see the darker side of anime and I definitely got it with this! 
Just the right amount of action, and just the right amount of plot. I just wish Hide and Uta were more in the story. They're both my favorite characters and neither of them have much spotlight. Hide T.T",10

                Tokyo Ghoul … 7/10 (in my humble opinion) 
A couple of years ago, I tried to write a review for this show but I lost my review and in a fit of pure ghoulish fury, wrote some batshit crazy review that probably lead people to believe that the entire Tokyo Ghoul community was filled with retards. 
In all seriousness, this is my review:
Tokyo Ghoul as a series can be taken one of several ways: an edgy anime that people use to pretend to be deep and thoughtful, a show about people beating the shit out of each other for no good reason, or even a
                  show that you stopped watching because of the fandom surrounding it. However you watch it, it’s really up to your own interpretation how good it actually is and that’s one of the best reasons for you to watch it. It helps you formulate your own opinions about a certain thing and that lessons can go a long way. (I’ll go into more detail later) 
Story: 8 
Story-wise, this is another: “Just read the manga” anime, you really won’t get too much at the beginning but slowly you can piece together what might be going on (you’ll still never know). Besides the shitty beginning and the HUGE building-hanger ending, it’s actually just what Tokyo Ghoul is all about: misunderstandings. Like I said before, the show gives you perspectives of both Humans AND ghouls and it’s not just all the good or all the bad, the show presents some genuinely good people get screwed over and some sickening people who do what they do just for thrills. You can choose whatever side you want and I like that aspect of the show.
Art: 9 
Boom! Amazing art, most scenes flow like butter and it’s all backed up perfectly… but wait… oh no.. is that… blood in every single gosh dang scene??? DAMMIT 
Sound: 10
You hear that? That’s not real life, that’s just Tokyo Ghoul 
Character: 6
Even though I like the multiple perspectives, there are wayyy too many sickening, unforgivable, disgusting individuals. This is where the edge is most prominent. All the “bad” guys are some abominations so that you would feel guilty when they get slices by a chainsaw or something equally as gruesome. 
Enjoyment:9 
Even with the extreme confusion at first, the show manages to be really good no matter what you came in expecting (action wise). 
Overall: 7
I will admit, some of the abysmal characters I mentioned earlier are (for the most part) essential to the story plot. But the excessiveness of some scenes really bog down the show (it’s still good though)",7

                Tokyo Ghoul was THE anime that made me stop watching my shoujo romance trash and dive into the deeper, more intricate depths of quality anime. I had never felt so invested in a character's personal discovery, semi-revenge, and worldly understanding until Kaneki, but after blasting through Season 1 (and √A), I was desperate to find other similar animes. This is how the genre of monsters vs humans clashing but also wanting to assimilate should be done...masterfully crafted plots, characters, and setting. Can't say the same unfortunately for the rest of Tokyo Ghoul (it really becomes absolute garbage in Tokyo Ghoul:re both in the anime and
                  manga) but I will never forget the perfection Season 1 and √A were.",10

                This Anime is one of my favorite. You can see it is unique on how they made it. This Anime is really awesome and cool, really cool to watch. It is surprising different and beautiful to watch. I love this Anime. The 2nd season is incredible too. I just don't get why there is a lot of people who give it a poor review. I think that they don't really care how incredible this is, maybe most of them only care about how is the character development, also they only care about the sounds and art. So maybe they just don't enjoy it.
But I think
                  this is an incredible Anime. You should give it a try. Its really incredible. 
I give this a 10/10 overall
~Because actually the CHARACTER development is PRETTY AWESOME
~Because the ART is FANTASTIC
~Because I LOVE the SONG
~Because This also like make me want to WATCH MORE",10

                Unpopular Opinion. A ""9"".
Story - 8
Let's all admit it, Tokyo Ghoul has a really good story to tell. I finished watching the first season with lingering questions do I resorted to the Manga. The plot for the Anime diverted at some points so I guess that is why it fell short of delivery compared to the pace of the Manga.
Art - 10
The characters are really well-drawn and despite the anime stratum of colourful hair, the colouring is actually really good and matches well with the grisly theme.Sound - 9
Quite an emotional OP which matches the whole story. Catchy.
Character - 7 
The anime focuses so much on Kaneki that you'll question why some of the characters exist. It may seem that some of the supporting characters exist solely for Kaneki, just to explain who he is.
Enjoyment - 9
How Kaneki is going to survive as a half-ghoul, the subtle comedic or ridiculous interactions and the gore is quite enjoyable.
Over - all 8.6 ≈ 9
Good story, lacks delivery. Read the Manga.",9

                Tokyo Ghoul is the perfect balance between character development, action and plot. Honestly this anime has the best character development of any anime i've ever watched, and as a result so many characters have become so recognisable in the anime community. It takes the classic human vs monster plot line and turns it around, looking on first from the human point of view, before diving into the mixed up world of ghouls, many of whom just want to live peacefully without being hunted or having to hunt to survive. Kaneki is the main character and possibly unusually the most popular at the same time. his
                  character development is beautiful, first showing a kind boy who everybody finds charming, and then putting him into the cruel world of the ghouls, where he experiences the ultimate losses and changes him in the saddest way possible after making the watcher fall in love with his character. it is impossible as far as i can see to not thoroughly enjoy this anime, with clean and modern art work, easily understandable but deeply beautiful story lines, and enough well developed characters that even if you're not a kaneki fan, Touka. juzo, hide or yoshimura will each provide an opportunity to connect with an anime in a way rarely possible. Tokyo Ghoul teaches of loss and changes in a person through experience, as well as viewing the world from the other perspective, something our modern world could do with so much more.",8
"
                This shows animation was straight fire to me. And I could never get tired of the op. I liked this a lot but Kaneki kinda needs to get his shit together in this show. Also the people in this show are kinky af not saying it’s wrong it’s just weird when some weird shit is said and your watching anime with your family. *cough* Rize *Cough*. But overall I enjoyed it. Tokyo Ghoul re and second season on the other hand yeah you will see that review. Overall this is a 7 to me I would watch it again but a third time would be
                  a maybe.",7
"
                Tokyo Ghoul, Who knows what kind of alchemy or black magic The producers were  doing when coming up with this one. A unique idea ill give you that. I'm giving it a 7 because although the story wasn't the best it was something i guess. 
Starting of with story about the characters being so dreadful, the anime relied heavily on the plot and the violence. The plot is very broad in the anime: Humans vs Ghouls and Ghouls vs Ghouls. At least that's what I got from 12 episodes adapted from 60 chapters. Although a lot of the episodes were about kaneki being a
                  pussy and half the people watching who wanted to beat him. It Had some of its Good things, maybe not in the story but they're good things. another part i found was absolutely useless was Touka trying to find kaneki in the last few episodes which resulted in Touka being memed the shit out of for beating Usain Bolt like what kind of drugs would you be doing if  you thought ah yes 3 episodes of running would be good content.
Like the Art style  I'm not saying its some Cyberpunk 2077 shit but For me who watched it in 2014 and 2019 it was good especially since the violence stopped being the absolute shit it was after them censoring everything. 
Sound was amazing, I couldn't find this kind of good songs in a ok-show , i remember looking back at how this soundtrack could be used for another show and how they wasted it on this.
Characters was , well  Kaneki was the biggest Piece of shit I've seen  like this takes pussy character's to a whole new level  (I dOnT wAnnA Be A GhOuL) anyways, Rize who died from a bunch of falling bars lmao. was useless she was a main character but really felt excluded at times. A lot were stupid  Tsukiyama being a pedophile, Suzuya a small mass murderer and side character Tattoo Artist who makes cool masks.
In the end id give it a 7/10 for the BS and all round not having to do anything with story but all of the characters mainly and music and art style.
if you're sitting in your room and feeling like i wanna look at a show which looks like it was made when a group of people were on meth then with Han Zimmer in another room just making jazz Tokyo ghoul  is For you.",7
"
                Weakest point was the character development, which was slow for my liking, but by the end of the season I was more than satisfied (hats off to the producers/writers) - I gave a score of 7 based on the general entire season, but if I had to do it based on the last episodes it would peak up to a 9-10. The sound and music is very fitting and chilling. Story setting was somewhat predictable, akin to many other supernatural animes, but the unraveling takes darker turns than most and managed to keep my interest hooked throughout each episode. 
I finished the season in 3
                  days.",10
"
                Overall I think this anime was good, but could have been a lot better. Seemed rushed at times unfortuntately. Characters could have used more development. The theme song was amazing. One of my favorite openings.  I enjoyed the story. It felt like there were things left out completely though. I have watched this anime multiple times. because I enjoy it, but every time I watch it, I see new things that they could have done better. The anime has a lot of faults, but in the end of the day I still enjoy it. I just wish they did a better job.

                ""Am I  human or ghoul?"" the main character, Kaneki Ken said to himself again and again in the world.
He was used to be human and normal boy as usual. He loves drinking coffee during reading books.
Suddenly Lise, the ghoul lady close to him for eating but Kaneki didn't notice that she is ghoul. Believe or not the heavy props dropped the place where Lise tried to eat Kaneki and she died but Kaneki didn't...
When he wakes up, he cannot eat food anymore. The story is including grotesque scene and cruel picture too but it's fun to see how Kaneki grows up in Antique which
                  is coffee shop by ghoul.",7

                Well here is a review of Tokyo Ghoul:
Well for starters there are a lot of good psychological anime out there that people can enjoy. So, why would anyone watch tokyo ghoul well its pretty much simple tokyo ghoul was over hyped when it was released. A lot of people think that tokyo ghoul is great but for me tokyo ghoul was the first one i watched. Well the story had a lot of potential despite the fact that the anime totally ruined it. The manga has already ended and has a sequel now. Tokyo ghoul leave too many things unanswered and there over all plot
                  was not that great. What i liked about tokyo ghoul is that the concept of it that makes it stand out from other series. The biggest flaw with this series was the ending as the season one ended on a cliff hanger but if you can get by the flaws of this series then there is a second season and i hope it answers most of the question.
well for season one the starting was good but the ending damn. Well i expected more but still if you can get by the story flaws then it was good despite the manga is even better. What i think is that people should give it a try and if you are a fan of blood and gore than you might like it. If you can get the uncensored version because the censored version always cover the good parts. Well for animation it was done pretty good since it was clown studio and the opening and ending are also great. I know there might major flaws with this but i think people should give it a try maybe you like or may not. Well it is a hit or miss.",8
"
                When I first started watching Tokyo Ghoul I had doubts if I would like it . But then the plot took off and i started enjoying the anime.
Tokyo Ghoul is pretty heavy anime and is not meant for the light hearted , many aspects like cannibalism provide a not so pretty image . 
The battle scenes are well orchestrated and the plot twists and turns and keeps us hanging. The anime has kept a tinge of fantasy.
I hope that the second part keeps the same flow as the first . But I think that the anime goes a  bit too fast.
They could have added
                  more episodes to give more content. If the second part doesn't make up for the first it would be  a  total rip off.
If you are interested in watching this anime I would advise you to watch it till the end.
All said and done it is a awesome anime.",8
"
                ""If I was the main character of a book, it'd be a tragedy."" At first, its confusing because a lot of references aren't properly explained. There's a different depth in the manga that doesn't fit into twelve episodes. The characters have their own individual abilities, but whether they're a ghoul/human.. everything returns to separate origins.
From my perspective, there's elaborate symbolism within the protagonist (Kaneki). I've put myself in their shoes. This gave me a melancholic feeling. I felt like ""Unravel"" was a great OP for the anime, because its undeniable how much it resembles the story. 
At first, I couldn't picture myself enjoying this anime.
                  I've come to see it as my favorite, now. I've watched it twice. If you're willing to look past the slow-pace, its worth giving a shot.",8
"
                To get something straight about bias, I have to admit I had never read or watched really any piece of vampire fiction prior to watching Tokyo Ghoul. And yet I always thought the idea of vampires were very interesting because of their overwhelming strength, despite certain crippling weaknesses like not being able to enter a building. 
When Tokyo Ghoul basically took the idea of vampires and spun it into the idea of their ""ghoul,"" and remembered to add a very important caveat that ghouls come with, I was intrigued. The basis of the anime was extremely engaging to me, and it presented itself as such:
                  ""What happens if you're a person in this world who literally HAS to eat other living things, specifically humans of your own kind? What sort of person are you to have to obey your hunger?"" 
And that was a beautiful question to a.... not so beautiful work. And for various reasons. 
However, before I lose anyone here with my negative outlook on the whole of the series, that question was INDEED very satisfactorily answered upon the conclusion of the season, and I would consider it frankly a masterpiece of an episode. 
What lets down Tokyo Ghoul as an anime is simply... a little bit of mediocrity in just about everything. The action never really interested me, even if it's cool that people can grow blood-tentacles from their bodies I guess. The characters are basically all completely forgettable except Touka and Kaneki. The art is straight-up not good. Like... it is by no means pretty or fun to look at. The music, well the OP is a banger and a lot of insert songs sound really nice, but the soundtrack wasn't memorable. 
Not to mention just... the awful plot. And by plot, I mean the overarching story and objective that this anime was trying to get to. It just makes... no sense at all, it's not interesting, and it's something we've seen before. It's a B-rated plot, there is little to no intrigue with the villains of the story or even the primary antagonist. It's just ho-hum. 
However let down Tokyo Ghoul is by many of these facets, it still come out on top as a positive in my book anyhow. And this is because of the question framed so early in the series, that the writers took extra care that it would, in time, be well answered. Not only do they tell you what sort of person a Ghoul who eats humans is: they show you why they are that way, as well what sorts of moral conceits must a Ghoul relinquish. It's not just a lesson for Ghouls in this anime: it's a universal lesson that can be learned by everyone who lives in an imperfect world. 
Kaneki is your typical milk-toast MC. But despite being bland, weak, and boring, that is frankly what makes this series work so well. They show the descent of an extremely meek boy into a full-blown murderer, and it's honestly a beautiful and sad transition that we see to his character. That said, this sort of development, while having its roots throughout the series, does not actually culminate until the very last episode, so you're going to have to put up with him kicking and screaming around like an idiot for a long time before you get an inch out of him. 
Touka is one of those two-faced characters who more often than not, she's not morally doing the right thing or the wrong thing. And it's simply her trying to do what she thinks is right which is interesting to watch, but she herself isn't a particularly fun character. She comes off as extremely similar to Mikasa from Attack on Titan in terms of how she perceives the main character and her stance on murdering. 
Anyways, let's wrap this up with a run through. 
Story - 5/10
Art - 5/10
Sound - 7/10
Character 7/10
Enjoyment 6/10
Overall - 6.5/10",6

                It is one of the greatest looking concept out of all anime, but it doesn't bring much joy to the plot and the character development. Also I didn't really get the overhyped of this anime and how does this considered as a list of must watch anime. I have pretty much to say that ken kaneki does deliver his character development and having a better relationship with hide. The rest of the anime is very bland for me and it is rare for me to watch the anime.
This anime really needs a brotherhood treatment with better character devlopment, no plot holes and much more.

                I really enjoyed the anime and by far it's my favorite anime of all time. The main character (Kaneki) was a badass, story was really amazing, and all the characters were unique and enjoyable. The opening for the anime was really good and goes well with the anime. The anime never got boring or less interesting and each new episode was a blast to watch. I really hope they release a new season later down the line. I have no complaints about the anime nor do I have anything that bugged me about the anime. 
   I recommend this if you watched and
                  enjoyed Parasyte as both animes are similar to each other.",10
"
                *Warning: Contains Spoilers!*
Let me guess... It's ""too edgy"" and ""too mainstream."" ""The anime wasn't faithful enough to the manga."" Well, I say BS to that. First of all, the anime is the anime and the manga is the manga. They're two separate things following the same/a similar story with the same premise.
In the manga, Kaneki is shown to be a lot smarter and more analytical during fight scenes. His ""random"" organ transplant is thoroughly explained later on in the manga. Rize's ""death"" is shown to be a set-up. The pacing is done a lot better. Yeah, I get it, but pretty much all anime have
                  to condense chapters of the manga. It's inevitable, and I don't think it's fair to say that they did a poor job when they clearly put in a lot of effort to get the main point across. They included nearly all the important details, and it's not their fault that some scenes didn't make sense when the viewer first watched them (at least, not for the first season) since they were given explanation later on (in the manga). 
Animation and filmography is a form of art; and although not everyone cares enough to interpret it that way, I think Tokyo Ghoul has a lot of artistic integrity. It doesn't include too much annoying fan service. Most people I've come across either love it or hate it without anyone being in-between, and I really like the controversy it stirs. The emotional impact this anime delivers is unlike any other. It's easy to simply kill the main character or everyone around them and call it a day, but this one focuses on psychological torture and transformation. It felt like I was witnessing the death of someone, but in a different way. The amount of development crammed into 12 episodes is amazing to me. I don't even know how it was possible. (I mean, Naruto took hundreds of episodes just to end the little ""finding Sasuke"" chase, and it somehow has a higher rating than this anime.) Additionally, Tokyo Ghoul doesn't start off slow like many other ""good"" anime. This one really grabs the viewer's attention right from the start and keeps it all the way to the end.
The characters are grounded and real. Even though I'm a human, the story makes me feel empathy towards the ghouls (maybe even more than the humans); and it's all because of Kaneki. He's never neglected, although other characters get their time to shine as well. He actually has a backstory, and isn't an emotionless robot lacking personality. Overall, Ken is an extremely likable character with basic morals. A lot of people seem to find Touka especially annoying at the beginning, and I have to admit that I found her slightly annoying as well. However, her reasons for hating the human race make a lot of sense. From her perspective, she was naturally born at a disadvantage. One could call it a ""victim mindset;"" but given all that she's been through at such a young age, it's kind of hard not to develop some sort excuse to make living slightly easier.
The incredible attention to detail and look of the anime is distinct. The color palette ranges from oranges and reds to blues and purples (with the addition of neutral colors). It's very soothing to look at, even the blood and gore. Tokyo Ghoul really makes the ugly and deformed beautiful. The scene where the carnations turn into spider lilies is just one example of symbolism used throughout the story. The soundtrack covers a lot of different genres, and everyone has different tastes when it comes to music. Regardless, I really loved it. Dissonance is made appropriate depending on the scene, and so are the melodic parts. Don't even get me started on the main opening. TK Ling might not be the best singer, but Unravel is a great song.
Last but not least, I want to make one thing very clear. The anime does not have to follow the manga exactly to be considered ""good."" I see so many people thinking that the closer an anime is to the manga, the better it is. That's just not true. If there are some elements the director wants to change, given he was granted artistic freedom by the creator himself, he should be allowed to change them. Whether they worked or not is up to the viewer to decide. The swapping of the mother and son with the two lovers is a prime example.
Overall, Tokyo Ghoul is art. It allows the viewer to see things from a different perspective and makes them question many moral principles. The story is quite simple, but well executed. If you're looking for something thought-provoking, Tokyo Ghoul is an anime that will blow your mind.",10
"
                This is a review of the anime only. I have not read the manga.
I’m writing this review after rewatching the anime several years after it originally aired. The originality has worn off and in hindsight, it wasn’t terribly unique to begin with. I don’t say that as an insult. There’s only so many truly unique plots or themes so writers now must take what already worked and give it their own personal spin, and that’s what this anime did. The Ghouls are sort of a mixture between sentient zombies and vampires. I still liked this anime the second time around but wasn’t quite blown away.
                  
What I liked:
1. Both sides had empathetic motivations and feelings. Yes, we were led to feel more sympathy for the ghouls than for humans, but the story did a good job of creating sympathetic characters on both sides.
2. The story was engaging and suspenseful. 
3. Most of the characters were likable or fun to loathe. They were complex with believable motivations and feelings. 
4. The humans were just as, if not more monstrous than the ghouls. 
What I didn’t like:
1. While I completely get Kaneki’s initial confusion and revulsion, after awhile, his indecisiveness about his nature and his role made him wishy washy and annoying. 
2. Niski’s backstory and motivations were great but in direct conflict with his behavior when we first meet him and there’s no real explanation as to why. 
3. I really wish Hide had been incorporated more prominently. 
4. There’s a lot of things left unexplained. I can deduce some things for myself but usually prefer to have a clear explanation at some point to know if I’m right, if I’m understanding what the author wanted me to draw from it. I especially don’t like being left with completely unanswered questions, like “Why did the surgeon use Rize’s organs? Did he know she was a ghoul? Was it an accident born of a desire to save Kaneki or was there something more sinister involved?”
STORY: What this story lacked most was a clear goal. There was no clear “finish line.” There were a couple mini arcs but no overall arc. Even if it’s never attained, like getting the One Piece, there has to be a specific goal to strive for. There can be no end of detours and distractions that serve to build the characters and/or the story (such as in One Piece) but in the end, there still must be a clear goal in mind. We don’t have that here, not on a story level or a personal level for Kaneki. The lack thereof made the story aimless and confusing for me. 
ART: The art was good. The kugane were done well, looking both natural on the ghoul body and alien, organic and solid. There was a variety of settings and backgrounds and each led to the atmosphere and mood to the scene. I found the color inverse during especially gory scenes interesting. The characters were distinct from one another in features and style. 
SOUND: I liked the opening song and found it fitting in style and words. It was memorable and I found myself humming it from time to time. The ending song was okay and the music during the show didn’t strike me one way or the other. Of the hundreds of anime I’ve watched, less than a handful have left impressions with soundtrack music so that’s not an insult. 
CHARACTER: I can’t decide whether Kaneki was complex or just confused, and I tend to lean toward the latter. Later in the season, he did become more resolute with a goal to protect those he cared about but through most of the season, he had no clear goal and seemed to wander emotionally and mentally. Since part of his character arc seemed to be about finding his way through his new situation, that’s not unreasonable. Personally, I felt that Touka showed the most complexity of all of them. She hated most humans but was completed devoted to her friendship with Yoriko, to the point of making herself sick eating her cooking. All of the characters were likable or fun to loathe, as in the case of Tsukiyama. I would have liked more time with some of them, like Uta, and more backstory. I think they could have removed some repetitive elements to show more backstory. 
OVERALL: I enjoyed it. It kept my attention and definitely made me anxious to get to each new episode. I wanted to know more about the characters and spend more time with them. There could have been more explanation of certain things and more character development but overall, I do recommend it.",7
"
                Tokyo Ghoul has certainly grown in popularity over the years since its release. The anime is known to pull at heart strings and deliver a story like none other. The idea of Tokyo Ghoul is fairly original, japan is under attacks by humanoid creatures called ghouls. Ghouls exhibit similar features to a normal human but have a special condition, they can not eat normal human food because their tongues are designed weirdly so their only means of food is humans themselves. Obviously this condition caused an uproar and a special force is mobilized to exterminate ghouls. I find that its within the story that can
                  divide the general consensus of the audience on which side they'd rather side with as the anime does well in showing both perspectives of the two sides and toys with the emotions of both sides with the constant theme of loss and survival of a race. Art style is drowned out and dark but holds glimmers of beauty with many scenes that still captivate me to this date and its through this art style that popularized fighting scenes (last fight of the anime was a pleasurable experience to witness). Sound track is extreme and gut wrenching to listen to and for good reason as it sets the tone of the entire anime well and honestly does not seem out of place in the slightest. The opening song is a cry of struggle and loneliness expressed by each and every character in the anime while the ending song is used to mellow out the intensity of the anime is if a way to say do not let this keep you down, push forward and overcome. The personalities of each and every character are vividly illustrated throughout the anime with each and every single character expressing their emotions quite proudly all throughout the anime.  I strongly feel that this show does not merit being enjoyable as its really quite sad and mellow, its quite the depressing experience but I still give it a 7 because of its brief moments of peace and tranquility before it forces reality back into you and makes you again release how much you really are worth. 
There are definitely better anime out there which is not to say Tokyo Ghoul preformed horribly, i just feel it is was fairly good for its time, plot wise and character development. If you are skeptical of this anime at first, you have all the right to be but nothing to be afraid about as I can vouch for your time to be well spent binge watching this one. It is truly one for the ages and who knows maybe you will have a different outlook on the anime then I did.",6
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is an interesting show. Rather than having you sit through a standard 'living in the secret world' show where the main character takes only 2 episodes to get fully adjusted, you get to see the psychological development of an innocent bystander who becomes one of the people that humanity loathe. Rather than being intellectual or action packed (although there is some good action in there), you get a story that focuses on the trauma that's associated with such radical and unfortunate change.
Take, for example, becoming a vampire, you wouldn't really think - 'I'm OK with this"". You would be traumatized that you couldn't
                  be the person you once were, and the fact that Tokyo Ghoul actually managed to grasp that concept puts it on my good side right from the start.
Story -
Don't let the synopsis fool you into thinking that this show is a standard 'I'm special, lets be friends' story. The story is in fact a test of the mind. The journey of one high-schooler and their many coping strategies. None of which work.
As I said before, the show is very psychological, and the story does a good job of making sure you know that. This is in fact one of the few anime where I would rather be dead than be any character in this show but that's probably why I find it interesting. Its a massive test of endurance, even for the people watching it. Not because its tedious or anything, just because there are 100's of times every episode where you think to yourself - ""What a sh*tty situation to be in"". I love it when an anime can establish such an environment.
While its not so much of a problem for you right now, as the second season has already been released, I do have to bash on the fact that the first season ends in one massive f*cking cliff hanger that rendered the previous 5 minutes of badassery completely void. While this is less disappointing to the people who have both seasons on demand, I can't ignore the cries of those who suffered for 4 odd months and should therefor consider it worth criticizing. 
Art and Sound - 
Audio wise, there isn't really all that much that I can say, it did its job and it did it well but there isn't exactly anything among the soundtrack that I will remember but it did a good job of establishing the mood.
Art wise, the animation was good, however what I am more keen to talk about would be the portrayal of madness. The personalities of the characters has the same effect but if you can physically see if someone is bat-sh*t crazy before they even speak then you know you've done a good job of making your art mean something.
Character -
Personality is everything when you're trying to convey emotion. Tokyo Ghoul does it really well. Kaneki is a very interesting character who is often very readable but that's good when you're trying to be an open book.
Other characters are pretty open as well, the 'Doves' are extremely interesting and unique and made for some really good villains.
Another thing to mention is that even the life-long ghouls experience the emotion that comes with being so.... Human...
And I think that's something that also has to be appreciated about the characters. Even though they are ghouls, the enemy of humanity, they're even more human than any of the humans shown throughout the show.
Enjoyment -
You don't enjoy Tokyo Ghoul, you experience it. With such a unique take on drastic change, its hard to not let it sit in your memory. My advice would be to experience Tokyo Ghoul, and enjoy that you did.
Conclusion -
I've said all I really needed too but if I had to say one more thing it would be:
Do watch this, its an interesting idea and its executed extremely well. While it does have its flaws I would say that its focus on adjustment and morality made up for it and made it more than unique.",8
"
                3 episodes in, I poured myself a glass of wine and said, ""good enough.""
Overall it was definitely overrated but not bad. Kaneki is kind of an unlikable protagonist at the beginning but becomes a little bit better by the end of the first season. The beginning of the story is interesting enough but it gets very convoluted and weird by the end of the first season. Touka is like a tsundere pixie dream girl, if that exists. It's very easy to fall head over heels for her but she seems like she was specifically designed for that purpose. there is a lot more gore than
                  is necessary to communicate the violence of the actions. It's kind of gratuitous.",7

                I realllyyy dunno what it is with everyone and this anime. We can all agree Tokyo Ghoul has to be one of the most well known mainstream anime about, yet everyone says it was rubbish. Well I on the other hand found it stunning.
Story: 7/10
The story was good, Ghouls vs Humans, Ghouls vs Ghouls. Not a plot that is completely original but was so satisfying and although it could've been executed better I enjoyed it so much. I liked the story because I liked seeing the emotions of both sides. The humans fighting for humans and Ghouls fighting for ghouls for all of the same
                  reasons it makes you want to say JUST GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER ALREADY. What Make me deduct 3 points off the story was how unrealistic the society was. Why were Ghouls allowed all this time to roam around Tokyo?? We know that every ghoul needs at least 1 human to survive a month yet this has never been stopped and the ""Police"" of this time seems to only want to investigate the ghouls not necessarily stop them. 
Art: 9/10
We all Love Kaneki's mask right? Its what we have all been waiting for the legendary mask made by Uta-san!!! I believe the art was stunning in Tokyo ghoul, People complain about the censoring but the version I watched on Kissanime is not censored so I cant complain. Why did I not give Art 10/10? Because It just wasn't a masterpiece.
Sound:10/10
After watching FMAB I found it hard to find an anime that could rival on sound and Tokyo Ghouls Opening has me so hooked like Wowww.
Character: 6/10
There's not much I can say, I liked all the characters but there were many clichés and it just got on my nerves at some bits. so if you are looking for an anime with DEEP characters with some pretty sad backstory's this isn't the anime for you.
OVERALL I Love this anime, love love love it, Mainly because I love fighting scenes and quirky animes, also badass characters soo Yep I would recommend anyone to watch this anime",9

                ***SPOILER FREE REVIEW***
(for people who want to skip the analytics,just go down to the pros and cons section)
Please take most of the reviews here with a grain of salt .Reading the reviews here can be discouraging and may make you feel that this series is worse than boku no pico.
(i have not read manga but will have to considering how bad root A was)
Now lets jump right into the reviewing part:
Story : 7/10
The story starts of revolving around the ""war"" between ghouls and humans where our protonganist faces an unfortunate incident due to which he becomes part ghoul part human. As the story progresses, we
                  can see that all ghouls are not necessarily bad and we end up sympathising with them ( never thought i will feel sorry for cannibals lol). The story is pretty well thought out but the amount of plot holes is absurd and we do not get in depth explaination of what is actually going on here.So,this is the kind of show where u turn your ""brain off""and watch(which is a shame since it had such potential).
Art: 8/10
A mixture of dark and vibrant colours blends perfectly with the genre of the anime making it very pleasable to the eye. Episode 1 immediately piques your interest.There is also shitty censoring which can be overlooked by uncensored version in blue ray discs. So 8/10 here
Sound: 9/10
Opening and ending songs were beautiful and amazing , definitely 10/10  if it weren't so over used in the series.
Charcaters: 6/10
The amount of development the charcters get is pathetic and negligable.
At the end of the show the only names i could remember were kaneki,touka,hinami and kureo mado (probably the coolest charcater).
One more thing is that characters like rize are not at all given development which i found annoying as she plays an important role in kaneki's life.
enjoyment: 9/10
The one thing this anime excells at is ENJOYMENT. I was never bored while watching this anime.The fights/Action scences were pretty cool and had just the right amount of gore to make it enjoyable. Even though the anime is a tad below average in terms of character develpment and pacing( but definitely better than some shows which i watched) ,it makes up for it by the entertainment aspect ,so its easily a well deserved 9/10 here.
Overall: 7+1/10 = 8/10 (+1 is just to troll the manga readers and the complete hate that some reviews had which made no sense lol).
Though this series lacks in depth plot and characters it manages to be entertaining (which is the whole point of animes of this genre) and catches your interest quickly.This anime DOES NOT live up to the hype in any way but if u like Attack on Titan then you might like this anime as well (As i told before watch this anime based completely on entertainment factor i.e brain off).Overall to sum it up this series is pretty average (considering the flaws) and falls in the category of ""watchable"" but I guess it isn't suitable for everyone ,though I personally would recommend to give it a try lol.
P.S (Yes,this series is far from perfect but it isn't bad enough to rate it 4,3,2,1. I dont know why there is so much hate for it ,it is way better than some animes i have watched and at the end it delivers what is most important :- ""Entertainment"")
Pros:
-Entertainment( gore, action scences and few emo/comedy elements).
-Sound is a A++
-Art was good 
-Story has potential to a make it self better (sadly, it wasn't the case so i will act like root A never existed)
Cons:
-lack of character development
-extremely rushed
-An absurd number of plot holes.
-has a pathetic sequel (just ignore and read the manga , resume anime from tokyo ghoul re)",8
"
                I give the story a 10/10. This was very unique and creative. I liked the whole story and the world they lived in, along with the dynamic between the ghouls and investigators. I am intrigued to see what happens next, and I just thought that the story they have so far is pretty good. I also liked the switch between the ghouls and investigators Point of view and stories because we get likable, good and well written and unique characters on both sides of the main conflict.
I give the characters a 10/10. No bad characters I can think of. They interacted well with each other
                  and most had at least some depth. The biggest amount of character development was Ken's at the end of the season. He came to a hard realization through flashbacks in his mind with Rize, and that was all pretty good. Not much else though in the form of character development. We got mostly good stuff with the characters we got, like good character interaction and development, like I said before.
I give the art an 8/10.
I give the sound a 7/10.
I give entertainment a 10/10.
Overall, I give 'Tokyo Ghoul' a 10/10",10

                **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
Tokyo Ghoul is a dark urban fantasy show that takes place in a city inhabited by both humans and men eating ghouls. The story follows young college student Kaneki that sees his life take a turn after a terrible incident.
Positives
Entertaining enough
Solid presentation
Character designs
Opening and closing themes are pretty catchyNegatives
Pacing. It's the shows biggest problem, it moves too fast, it never stops to breathe and we end up feeling like a lot of important stuff was skipped. I never read the manga but from what I've seen this show tries to squeeze 64 chapters into 12 episodes. Explains a lot
A lot of nonsensical and unexplained stuff happens throughout the story, some of which could've been addressed but it all comes back to the pacing issue
Lackluster character development
Episode 4 is a slap to the face, a waste of time in a show that has no time to spare
Inconclusive ending. Even when stories require a second or more seasons, you can still give a conclusive ending, this show does not 
A few odd directorial choices",5
"
                I really like concept of Tokyo Ghoul, but I think the protagonist is it's ball and chain. 
The parts of this anime that focus on the fact that ghouls have human intelligence but can only survive by eating human flesh are the best parts. It's an interesting moral problem, because ghouls were born ghouls and have lives that are equally as valuable as normal human lives. Do they deserve to live? If they don't, how do you justify killing one that goes out of it's way to do as little harm as possible?
Well the anime doesn't fucking care! 90% of it is about a whiny
                  little brat being a whiny little brat. The other 10% is a couple good arcs. 
This anime has a really ""One-hit Wonder"" Opening.
It's art is mostly boring cityscapes with the occasional beautiful neon fight scene in a carefully drawn area.
I think the anime is worth pretending to watch if you make sure to pay attention during good arcs, because it does have them.",6

                - English Review (Translated version)
I admit, my expectations of ""Tokyo Ghoul"" were completely null. The reasons were simple but meaningful. First of all, gore is something that doesn't attract me in the least. Free and unjustified blood and guts festivals don't have any kind of interest. Next, despite being very popular (almost Top5 popularity in MAL) I had heard very bad reviews. This is something that already happened to me with the overrated and ridiculous ""SAO"" and the result was disastrous. The fact is that I expected very little from ""Tokyo Ghoul"" and, perhaps also influenced by it, it surprised me for good. It is
                  not a masterpiece nor is it close to being one, but it is an interesting product.
The bad part of the plot base is that it's not excessively original. That premise of ""creatures that live with humanity on the planet and harm/feed on them"" is not new. The good part is that far from leaving this issue in a simple conflict, they delve into it, focusing on a deeper side, creating moral dilemmas and questions. They show us both points of view (human and ghoul) to make us doubt who is right, to make us reflect that there is no absolute reality. To make us reflect that there are no good or bad in this story, there are only two sides fighting for their interests under their own prism. This is something very well embodied and one of the strengths of ""Tokyo Ghoul"", at least this season. And I say ""at least this season"", because it looks like, from this first batch of episodes, the panorama is going to evolve into a typical and simple shonen, full of combats, factional fights, powers and other usual elements of the genre. Personally, I'm not going to check it out. I consider that the finale could be perfectly understood as closed within the context that I value and that, except for some secondary plot, what would come later would be irrelevant to it. This from my point of view. Those who see the finale as a ""cliffhanger"" I imagine that what they want is what I said before (typical shonen, combats, supertechniques, enemies ...) and I'm happy for them, because they will certainly have material that satisfies them.
With the characters I have contradictory sensations. They're an interesting, varied and with personality. Unfortunately, 12 episodes give very little and most of them are totally unused. I've seen critics of Kaneki, the main character, for ""cowardly"" and because ""he takes a long time to react"". People, he's a teenager who overnight goes from being a high school loser to being attracted by eating human flesh, to see witnessing murders and having to fight for his life. His evolution is completely logical and normal. For the rest, supporting such as Touka or Hinami are very good characters with whom one can easily empathise. It's a shame that there's hardly any time to see them, as I've said before.
Finally, the technical section is bordering on a good level. Especially on the artistic level, with an attractive drawing style and a very careful character design. Aseptic, but with personality. Without being outlandish, but also not falling into the generic. It has a good balance in that sense. The sound section, with the soundtrack as the maximum exponent, is not bad, but it doesn't stand out too much either. It does its job, that's all.
- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)
Lo reconozco, mis expectativas respecto a ""Tokyo Ghoul"" eran completamente nulas. Las razones eran simples pero con sentido. Primeramente, el gore es algo que no me atrae lo más mínimo. A los festivales de sangre y vísceras gratuitos y sin justificación no le veo ningún tipo de gracia. Seguidamente, a pesar de ser muy popular (casi Top5 de popularidad en MAL) había oído muy malas críticas. Esto es algo que ya me pasó con la sobrevalorada y ridícula ""SAO"" y el resultado fue desastroso. El caso es que esperaba muy poco de ""Tokyo Ghoul"" y, quizá influenciado también por ello, me ha sorprendido para bien. No es ninguna obra maestra ni está cerca de serlo, pero sí que  es un producto interesante.
La parte mala de la base argumental es que no es excesivamente original. Esa premisa de ""criaturas que conviven con la humanidad en el planeta y dañan/se alimentan de ellos"" no es nueva. La parte buena es que lejos de dejar este asunto en un simple conflicto, ahondan en él, enfocándolo hacia una vertiente más profunda, creando dilemas morales y preguntas. Nos muestran ambos puntos de vista (humano y ghoul) para hacernos dudar sobre quién tiene razón, para hacernos reflexionar sobre que no hay una realidad absoluta. Para hacernos reflexionar sobre que no hay buenos ni hay malos en esta historia, solo hay dos bandos luchando por sus intereses bajo su propio prisma. Esto es algo muy bien plasmado y uno de los puntos fuertes de ""Tokyo Ghoul"", al menos en esta temporada. Y digo ""al menos en esta temporada"", porque tiene toda la pinta de que, a partir de esta primera tanda de episodios, el panorama va a evolucionar hacia un shonen típico y simplón, repleto de combates, luchas de facciones, poderes y demás elementos manidos del género. Personalmente, yo no lo voy a comprobar. Considero que el final se podría entender perfectamente como cerrado dentro del contexto que yo valoro y que, salvo alguna trama secundaria, lo que vendría después sería irrelevante para ello. Esto bajo mi punto de vista. Los que ven el final como un ""cliffhanger"" imagino que lo que quieren es lo que decía antes (shonen típico, combates, supertécnicas, enemigos...) y me alegro por ellos, porque con total seguridad tendrán material que les satisfaga.
Con los personajes tengo sensaciones contradictorias. Son un conjunto interesante, variado y con personalidad. Por desgracia, 12 capítulos dan para muy poco y la mayoría quedan totalmente desaprovechados. He visto críticas a Kaneki, el protagonista, por ""cobarde"" y porque ""tarda mucho en reaccionar"". Gente, es un chaval que de la noche a la mañana pasa de ser un pringao' de instituto más a verse atraído por comer carne humana, a presenciar asesinatos y a tener que luchar por su vida. Su evolución es completamente lógica y normal. Por lo demás, secundarios como Touka o Hinami son personajes muy buenos con los que se consigue empatizar con facilidad. Una pena que apenas haya tiempo para verlos, como ya he comentado antes.
Para terminar, el apartado técnico raya a buen nivel. Especialmente en el plano artístico, con un estilo de dibujo atractivo y un diseño de personajes muy cuidado. Aséptico, pero con personalidad. Sin ser estrafalario, pero tampoco cayendo en lo génerico. Tiene un buen equilibrio en ese sentido. El apartado sonoro, con la banda sonora como máximo exponente, no es malo, pero tampoco destaca demasiado. Cumple su cometido, sin más.",7

                *NO SPOILERS*
*I am a manga reader, but this review is only for the anime, so I might compare it to the manga here and there*
[Story 8/10]
The story is perfect, only because of the manga...
The only part I like in this anime is some parts that are more similar to the manga, other than that it's so rushed, even if you're a manga reader, you'll find it hard to catch up because of how fast the things go.
[Art 8/10]
It is great actually. It deserved way better, but I can't say it is bad only because I had higher expectations.[Sound 10/10]
The best aspect of this anime. The soundtrack, voice acting, themes and so, are just outstanding, and don't get me started on the Opening, which is one of the best opening in all of anime history.
[Character 8/10]
All of the characters are decent. They're really charming in general, and it's up to you to choose on whose side you are.
The protagonist is... meh (I prefer Shinichi over Kaneki), not too bad, but the chemistry with Touka is there, and not completely invisible.
[Enjoyment 6/10]
As an anime, a 7, as a manga adaptation, a solid 6.
The manga is way better in every aspect, the anime just fails at it miserably.
[Overall 8/10]
I give it a 8 out of the respect I have for the Tokyo Ghoul manga, but as an anime, I'd rather give it a 7. If you're interested in the TG story, I recommend you read the manga instead of this rushed piece of anime. I don't recommend it at all.",8

                I wasn't going to write a review... after all Tokyo Ghoul is so popular who hasn't seen it by now? 
But I read so many negative reviews that I wanted to leave a positive one. Perhaps I can help a newbie out with deciding if they wanna watch it or not. Well, here goes.
Tokyo Ghoul is popular for a reason. It has great threads. Power of friendship, power of self will, cultural acceptance--- those kind of threads. For all the blood-soaked terror, undying rage, and just S A D N E S S , Tokyo Ghoul offers little happy scenes to quell your black little
                  heart.
The art style is very much something I would have enjoyed as an emo little high schooler. Watching this series as an adult nearing my 30s, I feel somehow nostalgic (even though I never watched Tokyo Ghoul as a child, it just looks like something I would have liked in those days). 
The musical selections are hit or miss imo.
The character development in this is just superb. Everybody loves to watch growth and learn the character's true depth and that's what Tokyo Ghoul offers.
I score this anime as a 9/10. There are some parts of the story that are a tad bit hard to follow. I feel certain characters needed more introduction/explanation. 
I would totally recommend this anime to anybody who has not seen it already.",9

                if you are in a hurry : this season is not that great in term of enjoyment but everything is fine in terms of story ,characters ,sound and all but the whole series is outstanding and worth it so much especially if you get the story  
Everybody’s saying that Tokyo ghoul is overrated and hyped and that’s a little true considering the first season only, saying that it has 4 seasons that are related of course and that are all trying to answer some questions  together, then you better expect from the first season to be a bit trashy especially that it was
                  really slow but that does not change the fact that characters were so good ,some events were magnificent and others heart breaking so it was good but the problem was in the enjoyment and i mean by that the excitement BUT!!!!! In the next season it gets more exciting and it becomes one of the animes that you like towards the end coz you start to get the story. 
So to sum up Tokyo ghoul first season had good characters, events and of course music but you’d be a bit bored but when you finish it it’s all worthy just get through the first season coz OH MY GOD it’s a masterpiece!!!!! The story can’t get any better I’m talking about the STORY, the questions that needs to be answered the philosophy and the point of it and what to expect which I will tell you what it is coz that’s always better for you as a viewer, during the whole anime you will see people suffering from ghouls and ghouls suffering from human ,human and ghoul victims and human and ghoul criminals so who has the right to live and who should die, you’re in a position where you’ll hear both sides but who should live when it seems impossible for them to be together, another thing the anime is focusing on is how awful it is to be weak while the protagonist is trying his best to save everyone he loves over and over again and other stuff but these are the really important ones . Other things that make this anime perfect is the development of the characters I’ve never seen this to happen so perfectly and that’s only coz you will watch them grow and change and become better or darker or wiser and it just brings them to life when they show you how life goes on and what two years can do to a person. In terms of enjoyment, it is enjoyable and a drama queen and things are really always spicy but it just gets calm sometimes or at least the enjoyment was not the reason i loved it for. hope i was helpful.",8

                  can understand from my spoiler summary how shallow the classic shounen anime concept is in terms of the first season subject,
the review only covers the first season, if it's liked, I'm thinking of doing it for root a and season 3 too,
The opinion I got from this anime is that it consists of sui Ishida's masturbation,

"
                I was overhyped into this anime, and got hooked in after watching the initial 2 episodes. 
However, how great the first few episodes were make me sad to give this show a 6. 
After finishing it, many questions are still left unanswered. For an example, it is illogical for Kaneki, our main hero, to be OP. These questions *should* be addressed in the 2nd season (at which point I'll update this review), but now they are mere plot holes. 
This show tries to put some moral themes but fail. 
Generally speaking, characterization was horrible. We get introduced into several side characters, who are all stylish
                  in terms of design, that barely get any screen time. These characters serve no purpose to the plot. Some characters are briefly introduced and then abandoned; others are abruptly introduced in the end. Even though Kaneki's the protagonist, I don't feel like I ""know"" him. 
To be fair, there are some characters that extremely well portray the dilemma of living as a ghoul. Both people and ghouls choose different paths according to their values. Nobody can tell which is the right way. 
At the very least, I can say this: this show was entertaining to watch mindlessly. It hooked me in and the battles were fun to watch. And I will definitely watch season 2. 
Oh, and the music is good. Especially the OP.",6
"
                After hearing that intro song for years without the context of what it's from, I finally watched Tokyo Ghoul. Does it live up to it's own hype? Maybe a little. I think if I had watched this back in high school I probably would have thought it was awesome. It certainly appeals to that teen angst chuunibyou mindset I had back then. The story is so bleak, ghouls being an accepted reality in this world and people just having to deal with the possibility of someone they know one day trying to eat them.
The protagonist suffering through those harrowing torture scenes only to come out
                  evolved into the president of the My Chemical Romance fanclub is probably what sticks with people the most about this show. Like I say it's something that really appeals to that mindset of when you're that age for whatever reason. Watching this as an adult it only makes me die a little inside remembering that black chapter of my life and what I used to think was cool. I can appreciate the show on a very surface level for what it is, but I find myself unable to truly be invested in it.
I liked the villains, the guy with the crazy eye is the ultimate example of evil aligned to a ""righteous"" cause. His partner, the serious one, seems like he's going to get an arc where he realizes that the real ghouls were inside us all along or the friends we made along the way or something. Basically it seems like old 1-eye ghoul is probably going to successfully talk no jutsu him at some point. Or murder him horribly, could go either way with a show this intentionally dark.
I give it an 8 out of 10 for never being boring, but for being too emo for me to want to grade it higher.",8

                So the Tokyo Ghoul anime adaptation has been criticized a lot for deviating abit from manga, and not at all being as good as the manga. To that I would say ""yes the manga is a lot better"" that can not be understated enough, but that doesn't mean the anime is bad. 
Let me start by saying that I first watched the anime back seemingly a month after the final episode had aired, and this was before I had read the manga. At  that time Tokyo Ghoul was easily in my top 5 animes of all time, and it may even still be to
                  this day even if I have read through the manga 3 times and watched the anime through a handful times. I would recommend the manga over the anime, but the anime is also very good if you prefer that medium.
For the sake  of simplicity I will divide the review into the 5 categories that are also rated: Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment. I will try my best to not write any spoilers. Also I will be rating the anime not the anime compared to the manga.
Story: *potential spoilers in this segment*
The story is good the main problem is that *potential spoiler* the season ends without a conclusion to the arc. The story takes more of a focus on the development of the main character more than the overall conflict, so the season ends without settling the conflict, which in turn made me read the manga to find out what happens after. 
So to one end the anime made me read the manga, which could be considered a success, but for people who didn't read the manga afterwards I could imagine the ending to be a huge problem, since there is no real ""ending"" to it all.
Art: 
I'm not an artsy person, so I can't say much more than I enjoyed the art style of the show. It did a good job invigorating emotions for the different scenes in the show.
Sound: 
I didn't pay much mind to the background music and sound in general. It wasn't bad, but I can't really write a review on it.
Character:
Now this is where I feel Tokyo Ghoul really shines, character development.  The protagonist thrown into a whole new world and the conflicts and dilemmas he must face. Tokyo Ghoul might be the anime I consider to have the best character development of any show ever. Without going too much into detail you get a good look into Kaneki's head throughout the show, and there is a lot of focus on Kaneki's psyche.
Other characters in the show are likable, but there is not as much focus on their development, but that most likely goes without saying as they aren't the protagonist. 
Enjoyment: 
I can say that even after watching the anime a handful of times I still enjoy watching through the series. Don't know what else to write here. xD
Overall:
The real downfall of the anime, which keeps it from getting a 10 score is that the manga is better. The anime is by no means bad for that reason. 
Another big problem with the anime is that it cuts off in an odd place and season 2, Tokyo Ghoul Root A, isn't nearly as good as the first.",9
"
                The only reason its not as good because of the adaption but it wasn't to bad for me I still enjoyed it. My fav character of all time is Ken so ofc I like the anime a little more then other people. The only thing I would change is them adding less eps.
Synopsis
Tokyo has become a cruel and merciless city—a place where vicious creatures called “ghouls” exist alongside humans. The citizens of this once great metropolis live in constant fear of these bloodthirsty savages and their thirst for human flesh. However, the greatest threat these ghouls pose is their dangerous ability to masquerade as humans
                  and blend in with society.
Based on the best-selling supernatural horror manga by Sui Ishida, Tokyo Ghoul follows Ken Kaneki, a shy, bookish college student, who is instantly drawn to Rize Kamishiro, an avid reader like himself. However, Rize is not exactly who she seems, and this unfortunate meeting pushes Kaneki into the dark depths of the ghouls' inhuman world. In a twist of fate, Kaneki is saved by the enigmatic waitress Touka Kirishima, and thus begins his new, secret life as a half-ghoul/half-human who must find a way to integrate into both societies.",8
"
                It starts simple. Kaneki Ken is an average quiet college freshman who loves reading books and hanging out with his only friend, Hide. The Tokyo they live in is going through a quiet chaos created by human- look-alike people called Ghouls, who live among humans but feed on their flesh.The story starts and expands as Kaneki struggles to keep his humanity through his encounter with different conflicting groups--Ghouls that cannibalize other Ghouls, those who kill humans and eat them more for enjoyment rather than need, humans that refuse to accept Ghouls are creatures capable of feeling as much as humans, humans who hunt Ghouls, and
                  Ghouls that believe humans should all be destroyed.",9
"
                It's a really REALLY great graphic in the anime. It's my favorite anime (and manga) because, the story is awful great, great sound even in my bad headphones, and this art is better than any other anime's i've seen. i enjoyed all the episodes. and i'm so exited for the 3rd season ti become an anime. 
the reason why you should see this anime is you are enjoying every little simple thing who ever you are.
but ofcause i would say if you are under 10 years you shouldn't. i'm not saying it's censored for you just that then i started i was 11 and i
                  got scared at the end of season 1.",10
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is, in a way, a modern day Evangelion. This is a pretty bold statement to make, so let me explain.
The series starts off with Ken Kaneki being unwillingly drawn into the world of ghouls in the same sense Shinji Ikari is drawn into the world of Angels and Evas. Sprinkle in main characters coming to terms with their respective circumstances, strong allegorical themes (prejudice and the dangers of indecisiveness in Tokyo Ghoul's case), final episodes consisting of mostly inner monologue (""congradulations""), and the overall dark and foreboding tones of the two series, and my prior claim becomes much more reasonable.
The character development in
                  this show is really quite good. Kaneki spends the first few episodes in denial, refusing to accept that he has become part ghoul and isn't completely human anymore. As the series progresses, he assimilates more into ghoul culture, and by the end grows to fully accepts himself as a ghoul. Touka was also an interesting character to see develop as the series unfolded. She comes off as cool and collected at first, but later in the series we learn that she wants nothing more than to be like the humans. At one point in the show, it is revealed that Touka is forcing herself to eat human food to the point of sickness, which illustrates this point rather effectively. Additionally, a few of the side characters, in particular Mado and Amon of the police force, were given enough screen time to make their scenes impactful, but their screen time never overshadowed the main characters and their actions.
Another talking point, and something I felt like the series did very well, was portraying sadistic characters in a frightening manner. The characters that antagonize Kaneki over the course of the series all had something about them that made your skin crawl, from Tsukiyama's occasional French dialogue and obsession for Kaneki, to Mado's half opened eye and malicious commentary, to Jason's large stature and finger cracking (not to mention the brutal torture scenes in the final episodes). Making evil characters seem like bad guys isn't too hard to do, but Tokyo Ghoul was able to make its antagonists truly frightening, which is much harder to pull off, so kudos to them.
The series is a bit slow to start however and didn't really pick up until about episode 6. The characters and backgrounds were a bit underwhelming as well (not bad, but they felt somewhat generic). In particular, the show didn't have ""that one character"" that so many other great anime have. Kaneki develops alright by the end, but he didn't feel as inspired or well written as main characters from other critically acclaimed series. He was no Lelouch from Code Geass, no Edward Elrich from Full Metal Alchemist, he just didn't really stand out as a character. The rest of the cast was not much better. Compared to the cast of characters from say Fate/Zero or Madoka Magica, the cast of Tokyo Ghoul feels bland and underdeveloped.
The soundtrack also felt uninspired. One of the songs from the OST, ""Auferstehung"" sounded exactly like the over-world music in Skyrim. Youtube it. Skip to 2:00 and click play. I swear to god I've heard this in Elder Scrolls before! It was really distracting every time they used this song in a scene and it really took me out of the moment, but that's a little bit of personal bias getting in the way. Nevertheless, the soundtrack was pretty boring overall; nothing really stood out as being above average, though I guess the OP was pretty good.
Overall, Tokyo Ghoul was a captivating series that never felt like it overdid itself for how ambitious it was at points, although I could not recommend the series to those who don't have a palate for gore and horror, and it's certainly not something you show the kids.",8
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is a very interesting idea, a world where ghouls (creatures who look like people) have to eat humans to survive. A pretty good set-up to make a horror anime. Only problem is I didn't find the show scary, at all.
Tokyo Ghoul follows the story of Kaneki, a boy who looks like (and is) a weakling who likes to read and his traversal into the world of Ghouls after a chance encounter who a female ghoul called Rize. A easy set-up to explain the morality, reasoning and ideology of ghouls and their interactions with their fellow man. Unfortunately I relate to Kaneki (Because) and
                  learning more about him and his ideals is enjoyable for me. Other character development is pretty fluid but unfortunately they're not as enjoyable in my opinion.
On the technical side Tokyo Ghoul looks good, characters are unique enough to told apart but blend to the background of Tokyo. Kagune, the biological weapons ghoul use for self-defense, are unique to each individual and are rather difficult to describe, which is good thing (spear like tentacles, Body armour, Wings like fire that shoot crystals, etc). The stiller moments are rather dull but during the action scenes is where the art does stand out a bit.
In addition soundtrack of Tokyo Ghoul does its job well enough bringing quiet to still moments, excitement to action scenes but nothing that will really stick in your mind and make you say,""man that was a good track."" The OP is the real gem in the soundtrack doing what all OP's should do, hype you up for a new episode while giving a 'feel', or opposite 'feel', of a show (cough, Death Parade). I watched the anime subbed (which is a rarity for me) and I have to say that I didn't at all notice or care about the VA's but they did a good job all the same even though there weren't that many scenes where a good performance could make or break the moment.
Unfortunately Tokyo Ghoul is apparently both a horror and a mystery apparently and the key (in my opinion) to good mystery is not even letting the audience know the answer to questions at first (or till the end) because then its not a mystery it's a thriller. And speaking of answers Tokyo Ghoul did not provide much at the end opting instead to create more questions, which is not necessarily a bad if you want an open ending but Tokyo Ghoul wasn't trying to spur your imagination it just didn't tell you the answers. I like the ending but that's for personal reasons and I wanted to look at face value.
In conclusion Tokyo Ghoul is a Horror anime that wasn't scary and a mystery anime that left the mystery for the end. However it has great character development and great art. I like it. Its pretty good as a one cour show *minor spoiler* if you don't include root a.",6
"
                Well, I really disliked this anime in the beginning and have many dislikes, but by the end of the anime I loved it and also have a lot of likes about Tokyo Ghoul. (I can't really remember where season 1 and season 2 splits so sorry, this is kind of merged together with both seasons, hope I didn't make any spoilers.)
DISLIKES:
I don't really like how Kaneki Ken couldn't really accept that he had become a ghoul, like it happened, it's not going to change, and he made such a big deal out of it for a very long time which ended up getting highly annoying.
I
                  also don't like how when Kaneki became a ghoul he was SO weak, he couldn't even do anything at all, he would always be defeated in like the first hit, and he didn't even really try to fight back.
I don't like how at times he would try to say things to get him out of a situation, like saying ""not all ghouls are like that"", I mean why is he just trying to get on the good side so he doesn't have to fight. :/
Also don't like how he cries over every little thing, he sometimes acted like a little kid and everytime something went wrong he would end up crying and everything, that got annoying fast to me.
I mean yes, I like how he got strong, but I don't like the WAY he got strong, that just ended up being tragic and he ended up being completely different, I can't really say much about this since it would be a spoiler.
I don't like how it took very long for him to finally get strong, it took so many episodes for all the real action to begin.
And, the last I can think of is that he is always relying on someone to help or save him, otherwise in the anime he would've been dead by like episode 2, but he was always being saved by someone, just being honest.
LIKES:
I like how he got strong and was finally able to fight, and he easily became one of the strongest, and this is when all the good action scenes came. He's able to beat practically everyone.
I like how at the end of the anime there is a ton of action but it is also tragic at the same time.
I like how he started to make his own decisions for himself, and stopped relying on others for everything.
I like how he started to accept himself as a ghoul after a while, and stopped trying to get himself out of certain situations.
I like how there is tragic scenes throughout this anime, at one point I almost cried.
I like how the storyline went overall and throughout the anime it just started to become better and better in my opinion and changed my thought about Tokyo Ghoul, pretty good, I was thinking about dropping it at one point but I'm glad that I didn't.
Now, this is one of the best animes I've watched so far, I know it seems like a lot more dislikes than likes but I completed it a while ago and probably forgot some of the things I should add. All I know is that I ended up loving it.",10
"
                tl;dr: A somewhat dark anime that is incredibly weak in most every aspect but that builds up an incredible finale, though one that's not much of an ending.
I have not read the manga so I can't compare the adaptation to the original source material, but overall the first season of Tokyo Ghoul I didn't find all that great. For the most part I wasn't really sure what I was supposed to find compelling about it either. The core story is about the protagonist going through major changes resulting in moral quandaries and having to readjust to accepting himself while dealing with various situations and characters.
                  Here's the thing, the protagonist is completely and utterly useless. There are various situations he ends up getting involved in, but ultimately his actual contributions are incredibly minimal. He also has the mental fortitude and general mentality of a child. Hence, even though him coming to terms with who he is could have been compelling, ultimately it isn't compelling at all as he doesn't seem to be growing at all. Various situations occur that should have a major impact on him in causing character development, but all they do is result in him feeling sad and useless with no growth at all in pushing him to be less useless next time. All he does is get beat up and cry pretty much. It's painfully frustrating to watch.
Furthermore, while there are a series of moral dilemmas, they're only lightly touched upon, and that's being charitable. They're not explored anywhere near close enough for them to feel like something the narrative draws strength from. It all feels superficial, and hence it's impossible to really sympathize with the characters that are facing these dilemmas either. I feel that this was supposed to be a core aspect of the personalities in most of the side characters, but as it really didn't land all that well, its hard to really care all that much about said side characters, and as a result major events like character deaths have pretty minimal impact. On top of that, there's this weird trend where there are attempts at giving depth to antagonists which don't really work at all as they're originally presented as blatantly irredeemably evil, which makes it even worse when they quickly change to the protagonist's side.
The action isn't very good either, in that its pretty rare for an action focused anime, and on top of that isn't that intense or exciting. The show in general also isn't that gory, there's just a lot of blood splatters which don't matter all that much anyway since ghouls can heal from pretty much anything it seems. It also felt like there was bizarre pacing, wherein it felt like it was rushing through events and not developing them properly, but as a result it feels like all of these events were pointless and should have just been skipped entirely so it also felt kind of slow. The art and animation were solid enough, but in terms of style it didn't really feel like it did anything with them. Just the masks being cool really isn't enough. The OP was decent enough in terms of visuals and audio, but the ED actually felt a bit plain.
With all that said, I still consider the anime reasonably solid, and that comes down entirely to the last episode which is a tremendous break from everything before it. The first most noticeable difference is that while the art and animation are still the same, stylistically it does a number of amazing things such as the use of imagery, metaphors, intermixed flashbacks, rapid cuts, etc. that worked incredibly well. It also gets a lot more gruesome, not in terms of what it shows physically but in terms of psychological impact, to the point it actually feels like it has as dark of a tone as a show about ghouls should have. This episode focuses solely on Kaneki, who while a protagonist had essentially been a minor character in his own show up to that point, which is crucial because in this episode his character finally hits his stride. It becomes clear at this point that the entire point of the anime was to build up how pathetic the protagonist was while also showing him going through a number of experiences that should result in major character development only for them not to, so that ultimately when things reach their climax in the last episode and everything clicks, he goes through tremendous growth in a spectacular manner that is downright epic becoming a character that at least for that episode fully feels like the type of character that a protagonist should be. The action too is at the best its been in the series in this episode. I can't stress enough how great of an episode I thought this was, a tremendous cut and above beyond the previous twelve in pretty much every aspect in such a way that each improved aspect being better plays off of each other, such as in the far better direction and use of art resulting in the character development being incredibly impactful. It saves the series pretty much single handily. With that said, it isn't the perfect ending, in that while it is an incredibly episode on its own, it's in the middle of an arc, and hence the season itself ends in the middle of an arc at what feels like the best part, which is pretty disappointing.",7
"
                I was interested in watching Tokyo Ghoul because a lot of people were talking about the anime.  So I wonder how good the anime is.  But after i checked the ratings and reviews on MAL i decided to read the manga first.  Well, I enjoyed reading the manga.  However, when I watch the anime adaptation, i felt something was missing.  They cut too many scenes in the manga and sometimes replace it with a different plot.  In the manga, the character development isn't too bad.  In anime, huft if you only watch the anime, you will definitely be
                  confused and can't feel the development of the characters. Too bad a good manga didn't have a good anime adaptation. What i enjoyed the most is of course the soundtrack.",6
"
                The first 12 episodes from Tokyo Ghoul are outstanding. The art, the soundtrack, the characters and the universe construction are wonderfull.
Then, comes season 2 and ruins everything. Even the author doesn't know how to progress with the own piece he created. But I must say that the first season of Tokyo Ghoul is perfect.
The story instigates the viwers to be curious about the universe. Who are the ghouls? Why do they eat human meat? How they can be saved? The first season presents that to us, and we hope to get those answers in the subsequent seasons.
The art, even for Pierrot, is magnificent and fluid.
                  The color contrast and light make Tokyo in this anime gets a very specific atmosphere. The fight scenes are also good and fluid. 
The soundtrack does everything. Its just perfect. The opening music is an hit and the piece have a lot of memorable pieces, like ""Licht und Schatten"" and ""Symphonie"".
Overall, Tokyo Ghoul First Season is magnificent and has much more qualities than flaws.",10
"
                Generally there are two things that are necessary for me to get into an anime. It needs to have good art and sound direction. Tokyo Ghoul puts both on display, but before we get to that, let's talk about the story. The general premise has a great deal of potential and a whole lot of going power. The idea of Ghouls and their conflicts with Doves leaves so much room for expansion and story progression, with different kinds of Ghouls and Doves with their different strategies of how to deal with each other. It starts out rather simple, and perhaps a little shallow, but as
                  more characters are introduced and more of the story branches off beyond the concerns of the main character, it becomes a great story. Now, the Art direction. First off, the setting of Tokyo is a vibrant and aesthetic background, providing constant life and motion surrounding the main story that many anime lack, even when they're set in a city. This also serves as yet another colorful and masterful showcasing of Studio Pierrot's sheer talent in illustrating the world of Tokyo Ghoul. The sound is also realistic and multifaceted, allowing yourself to get lost in the immersive atmosphere of wherever the show is at any given point. The music, however, is moving in a way that is almost unmatched. I don't think i skipped the into even once, and the music that played during moments of high-strung emotional tension never failed to move me in a very real way. The characters are interesting and dynamic, though they don't really seem to learn as much as they are changed by the circumstances surrounding them. For example, Kaneki goes from nervous to full-on edgelord, but that isn't really development. I have no real gripes with how they handled that, but that is part of why it stays at an 8/10. Overall I loved this anime, first as a work of audio-visual art, and second as an anime. Highly recommend.",8

                Dark and Serious [Story] 
A dark anime about a character who accidentally got turns into a ghoul and now can only eat human flesh. A story about a protagonist having a dark side is common in anime plot but to see his pain and the struggle he face'es with his other half in almost every episode can be overwhelming. Along side other ghouls who just want to be accepted by society as well as others who try to overtake it. Two sides are presented in the story and all about making the decision choose even if not making a decision at all.
""You know what it
                  feels like to have a dark side when you see these character""
Beautiful Gore [Art]
The first thing I notice about this anime was the art style, not just the opening and ending theme but also the animation especially those dark red eyes can really get your attention.
Humans and Ghouls [Characters]
Whether you are a ghoul or a human, they are characters that have emotions and personality that drives them if not lust and pride maybe anger and sorrow. Watch these character live there live's in a world that call them a monster.
The Ghoul Inside You [Overall]
I just love a good story with a serious tone and a gore in the mix is what makes Tokyo Ghoul so memorable.
Tell me, tell me how that works 
Is there someone inside me?

                Tokyo Ghoul is an invitation to the manga. A lot of anime is pretty much that, but Tokyo Ghoul is even more so. Every character here has a lot of backstory going on and we can see the people behind the show trying their hardest to cram everything in 12 little episodes. There are many interesting characters all around going through their own hardships and doubts. Even at the very end we're still getting introduced to a bunch of characters, situations and whole institutions we didn't even know existed 10 minutes to the end of the show. It is an expansive universe and the anime
                  does a good job at giving you a brief tour to this world and the people living in it.
Tokyo Ghoul is like a dark fantasy slasher where no character is disposable. If I had to describe this show in a single sentence that would be it. Everyone has a good reason to be here, even if some of the characters a little tropey, it's always engaging. Each episode points to something that we would like to know more about. What training investigators get that they become as powerful as ghouls? What is the procedure to make a kuinke? Mado-san's family, Rize's business in the 11th ward? And so many other things. The response to all of those are the same: It's time for you to pick up the manga.
The anime will just give you the basics. It's the struggle of coexistence. Like with the X-Men, but here mutants are ghouls and have to eat people in order to survive. Some ghouls enjoy the predator life and live it to the fullest, while others believe in a peaceful coexistence. How they do that? By eating people who suicide, of course. It's a delicacy. All ghouls have to deal with the hunger and the human police force specialized on hunting ghouls. The setting is one messy Tokyo, which is perfect for this stories to develop. 
I mentioned there are no disposable characters and I mean it. It's sad to see some of these people's demise because there's always so much going on for them. We get to know their families, friends, what they believe and where they stand in this crazy, crazy ghoul world. Even when they're quite obviously evil, they have a good reason to have ended up that way. There's nothing without cause in Tokyo Ghoul, that much the anime managed to make clear. So what's next? Time to pick up the manga.",7
"
                If there was ever a slow burn, Tokyo Ghoul is that. This first season of Tokyo Ghoul feels like watching someone light a stick of dynamite, waiting for it to blow, and then relishing in the satisfaction that comes from watching it go off. 
The animation is very nice. The art is so great to look at. It's fitting of the shows theme, very dark when it needs to be and the gore elements are tasteful in use and execution. The fight scenes are high level as well. They really compliment the powers the ghouls have and fit in well in contrast to the humans
                  that they face off with.
Kaneki's descent into the ghoul life is full of slips and bumps as he tries to adjust to all the new aspects. As far as the story is concerned, it takes a while for the plot to really develop into the beast that it will be in season 2. It isn't fun at all to see Kaneki struggle with the new life. The subplots of the series make the time pass a little more but up until the 9th or 10th episode the plot is a bit lackluster. There are some highlights however. There are moments when you see the changes that are happening to Kaneki and he really appears like a changed man. These moments are fleeting and far between, that is until the end of the anime. 
The span of characters in the show is decent. Although Kaneki is undoubtedly the MC, the supporting cast doesn't feel that inferior. They all carry their weight and add so much more to the show. With Anteiku Kaneki is able to form a new family. It was nice watching Kaneki and Touka's relationship as well. 
As mentioned before, we see Kaneki's descent into the life of a ghoul and it really is a beautiful sight to see him fully realize his powers in the end. The battle between him and Jason is one of my favorite moments of all time. The music placement was perfect, the dialogue was layered and full of personality fitting of the moment. The terror and triumph of the scene is unparalleled. The best thing this scene does is blast the door open on what season 2 holds. The show gave itself room to blossom and  grow and that what this show does best. 
Tokyo Ghoul is a mature anime that really illustrates the evolution of a kid who besides fighting with actual ghouls and people trying to kill him, he is fighting his new found nature and is battling for his own humanity. It's a charming watch and worth every minute.",7
"
                As an anime watcher, I am so disappointed that I had to read the manga for more better story and pacing. As an anime standalone, It did alright. However, the second season adaption kind of went down hill from there. But more importantly, I will tell you my standpoints as an anime watcher, and not as a manga reader since that portion should be reviewed for the manga section. But I'll tell you this and I'll tell you now, read the manga.
Story: Kaneki Ken see himself as just as any human being, but because he likes reading books, he mention that if he is ever
                  a main protagonist character in a story, he would be a tragic one. Thus, start the life of Kaneki when his world went upside down upon being tricked by a ghoul and almost died. But thanks to a certain doctor, Kaneki was saved, but something went wrong during his operation. Inside of him, what is it that makes him so different between ghouls and human. The concept of different creatures besides us human and general animals has always been puzzled and quite unknown. Because we fear the unknown, we tend to take it the wrong way and misunderstand things and make it worse. Kaneki will be the one that'll correct the world thinking because he has live both sides and understand well enough to desire peace between human and ghouls. The anime, unfortunately, ends with Kaneki being a total idiot and just plain random. His character is completely broken and became inconsistent to his character, sadly. With season 2, the plot became entirely different from the manga and while, it wouldn't be terrible if Tokyo Ghoul was just an anime standalone, unfortunately, it's just not good as the manga.
Art: Other than censorship, the art was very accurate and pretty and stay true to the original manga. Animation of fighting and graphics and all were excellent.
Sound: THAT OPENING! Personally, I don't like the singer for Unravel, so I tried to search for another singer with the same song. Yanagi Nagi does best for Unravel, but that's just my opinion, of course. Other than such great composite piece of opening, other sounds, such as fighting were great and felt appropriate. The ending was alright for me.
Character: Two words: Inconsistent Characters. Especially, Kaneki Ken. The anime just fall short because the details they left out in the manga. And most of it isn't minor either. They are essential for the development of the character. This is where the anime lacks other than the story line. 
Enjoyment: It was alright. But I recommend watching the anime first before reading the manga because you'll likely drop the anime if you already read the manga.
Overall: It's an okay anime series. First season was okay, but the second season is where it goes down hill. If you are an anime watcher like me and often not read manga, I advise you to finish the anime and read the manga. That, of course, if Tokyo Ghoul still interest you.",7
"
                Tokyo ghoul is aother of those anime. One of those anime like SaO and AoT that, due to his popoularity, is hated more than it deserves. I will start to say that a lot of wasted potential lies in this series but, in the end, is not as bad as everyone pictures it. 
Story -7- Ok, the story is rushed. No doubts about it, no complains. The reviews that underline this point are right. After all, they took a manga with more than 100 chapters and they compressed it in 25 episodes (12 in this series, 13 in the second) and, as it always happens
                  when authors do something like this, important plot points go missing, the unraveling of the plot appears rushed, characters don't get a proper characterization...I have not read the manga but I can imagine it went like this because it has happened with other anime (Akame Ga Kill, Deadman Wonderland, Elfen Lied...) 
The fact is that this is a shame because the plot was very good and intersting, from my point of view. Yes, there are the usual premises for the story about a guy who become very powerful after a tragic event and so on, but for some reason i felt that this particoular story was very promising. I tought that a good author could have moved the plot in a lot of different directions. I found intersting the conflict between cannibal monsters forced to live hidden in a modern Tokyo and humans, the fact that Kaneki has to cohabit with the ghoul that unwillingly saved his life with his organs
However, while some parts of the story are fairly good (for example the last two episodes, I really can't understand why everyone hate them that much. I liked the way Kaneki has to accept the ""monster"" inside him to react to a brutal and merciless world, even tought the ending of the series was a bit rushed and wasn't explained enough) other parts are too confused, we have characters who appear for just one or two episodes and who do absolutely nothing, except for looking at the battle between ghouls and CCG from a building saying sensless things
Oh, and another plot point that the story misses completly: where do ghouls come from? We have some hints about the CCG being founded in the XVII century, but then what? I wish that the anime gave us a backstory about the conflict between ghouls and humans, that would have been very intersting. 
Art -9-While the drawings of the characters are very good, the strong point of the art are mainly two. The first is the dark atmosphere of the city. Even in the daytime, this fictional Tokyo gives me the feeling of a cold and merciless city. 
And the second are the action scenes. The fights between more ghouls or between ghouls and CCG are great, not much to say about it. 
Sound -10-This is maybe the first 10 I give in a review. Yes, the soundtrack is amazing and a good half of the merit goes to ""Unravel"", one of the best opening ever heard in an anime (even tought I had to hear it a couple times before I started to love it). The background music is also fitting and the dub (the Italian one as I watched the series in Italian) is flawless. Some characters such as Mado or Kaneki are dubbed perfectly.
Character -5-Here, this is the main problem with the story. After all, as I said before, when you try to put thirty or so volumes of a manga in a couple of episodes, is very hard to give justice to every character. While the characters themselves are not bad at all (some of them are really intersting indeed) the amount of screen time given to them is usually too little to get attached to them. The few characters who are given a proper characterization and backstory are Kaneki, Touka, Mado and maybe Amon, the others are pretty much left on themselves. And even for the ones who are characterized, the analysis of their personality and their character is reduced to the bone, mainly due the shortage of time. Some secondary characters had so little time on-screen that I found myself struggling to remember if I had already saw them in previous episodes. And this, also, is a shame because you can feel as you go trought the 12 episodes run that getting to know the motives of those characters was fundamental for the evolution of the plot 
Enjoyment -7-If you manage to overcome the evident flaws that the series shows thinking ""Ok, I just want to have fun watching monsters and humans fighting for a good 20 minutes"", you will found that this anime is indeed very amusing and thrilling. The action scenes are great. Some episodes are awesome. The plot, even if rushed, is pretty simple to follow and I can't understand who bitches saying ""This part doesn't make any sense"" and stuff like this. The only part that doesn't make any sense is Kaneki joining Aogiri without giving an explanation
And also, a thing that in my opinion ruins the dark mood the series started with, is the fact that the ""minor antagonists"" in the fist half of the series don't die. This is pretty anticlimatic. 
Tokyo Ghoul is an anime that will enterain the viewers with his action scenes and his great setting, I don't think that it deserves all the hate it gets. Surely, the fact that it become so poupular has contributed to his negative reviews. However, is not the masterpiece that I feel that it could have been if it wasn't so rushed. I think that I will try to read the manga.",7
"
                This anime is good, but is a little lacking in some areas. First off *THIS MAY BE A SPOILER* but it has a cliffhanger ending that has good build up, yet is unwanted. I'll go back to the beginning though, it has a good first episode, building the world and characters around you with some mystery still. The second episode continues this and delivers in the action. I get lost with the third or fourth episode and I actually stopped watching for a few days and finished some other shows. With the fifth episode it makes a strong comeback and finishes ""the arc"". The next
                  few episodes have a great story and really build on the characters and the world they're in. I have nothing else to say about this arc, besides saying that it is 10/10 but may be slightly predictable. The last arc of the show let's call it the 11th ward arc starts of great. The problem I have is the ending of the season, that ruins the arc slightly. It has good build up, action, characters, and messages, but the cliffhanger kind of ruins it for me. It is hard to describe without spoilers, but I'll say that the first episode of season two is  better endpoint in my opinion.",8
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is a strange one. On one hand, you have an amazing psychological story but on the other hand you have a rushed adaptation. I'll be discussing all seasons not just the first one. I'll also keep it brief. 
Season 1: I actually thought it was really good. I was intrigued the entire time I was watching it. Your watching this guy essentially go through psychological torture as he's fighting with his human side who struggles to kill another human but then there's his ghoul side where if he doesn't kill and eat said human he will die a painful death. It's all super
                  interesting and intriguing. 
Season 2: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Season 3: Its not insultingly bad but it's still bad.    
Man, this could've been a great anime adaptation but it just falls flat on so many levels
Now when we talk about the Manga.... well, it's a basic masterpiece. Go read it now. 
Tokyo Ghoul is the literal definition of ""Just read the Manga."" Just do it. If you want to get into the series just read the manga. I don't have anything else to say... just do it.
Oh, I will give some bonus points for the Openings. Unravel is really good and probably one of the best OP's ever. The second one is meh (I don't remember it). And Asphyxia is also really good but not as good as Unravel. I think there was a fourth one for Re but I couldn't bring myself to watch anymore of it.",5
"
                (didn't Read the manga) 
1- feels empty.. I liked the story but fells empty, something is missing...
2- sound is great, the gore and music is great maybe that is what is making me see it..
Main character... Main stream... The characters relationship is what we saw in another animes.. Nothing ""new"".. But keeps us engaged in some point.. 
Longer anime plus more detail about why ghouls exist, why they act that way... They try to feed you with art and fight... Don't get me wrong I loved the animation at fights but... Storyline would be great.. I would say more but.. No spoilers..
7/10",7
"
                I'll be very honest, I am not the best reviewer and this is my first time, This is 100% my own opinion, But to me, Tokyo Ghoul is the best Anime I have ever seen, I like the differen't characters and that it isn't only based on Ken Kaneki, You get to know many different characters and learn about their perspective through the anime, Like Kureo Mado Or Nishio Nishiki, I used to dislike them but then I found out more about them and that made me like them. It has many interesting things and to me its special, Many say that the anime doesn't
                  really focus on Ken Kaneki, But just like the real world, Its not about a single person. To me this was a masterpiece, The art is beautiful. The story is great, And oh god, The music, I just love the music that I listen to Unravel like almost every day XD. and I can't wait for the third season, I haven't read the Manga yet tho but I will try to. Anyways, I hope this has been much help, I give this a 10/10 because I just love the anime and I saw nothng wrong with it and I enjoyed every single thing of it. I hope this review was good and I hope that some of you enjoyed it as much as I did. Thank you for reading my review.",10
"
                Tremendo.
Che brutto anime.
Vorrei dire una cosa positiva ma non è facile trovarla, credo sia uno degli anime più sopravalutati di tutti.
Rega è proprio brutto.
I personaggi sono brutti, la storia ha dei buchi di trama che fanno ridere, a tratti è noioso e assistiamo ad azioni talvolta senza un minimo di senso.
Consigliato a chi vuole smettere di guardare anime.
Le musiche non sono male e quindi, contando che di che tipo di anime stiamo parlando, vengono quasi sprecate.
Sprecate come il tempo di chi guarda quest'opera d'arte.
A differenza di altri anime popolari, in Tokyo Ghoul non riesco a capire cosa abbia convinto così tanta gente.",4
"
                I've watched Tokyo Ghoul long ago, but my overall impression of the series is still very present on my mind. (btw, I haven´t read the manga).
 I feel the main problem of this story is that it's too rushed. New characters (that never develop) are introduced in each chapter and we never really get to know them. The pacing is just so fast and leaves many plotholes that it made it impossible for me to get really inmersed.
 I feel like I didn't really got to know the characters, not even the main protagonist, Kaneki. At the start of the series it seemed that his
                  emotional struggles and moral dilemmas would be portrayed in a captivating way, but at last, that didn't happen. (blame again the shitty pacing).
 Although I have to recognise the artwork and music of the series is overall good, that didn't save me from getting bored and very dissapointed.",5
"
                I expected more from this season. For the most part, it was quite slow and I found it difficult to get immersed in the story. It would've been easy to make up for had the characters been developed during that time, but I feel like most of the development I enjoyed took place in the second season. 
However, the premise of Tokyo Ghoul is fascinating. I'd love to know more about the lore and history of ghouls. Also, the art style is stunning. Everything from the colors to the effects caught my eye. 
I wouldn't say this anime was a let down, but I think
                  it was built up too much in my head and it sort of flat-lined compared to that. However, it's still worth a watch, I think. The end of the season is quite brilliant, and the message of it is intriguing, to say the least. Not to mention, it sets up a pretty good second season.",8
"
                First off I am a huge tokyo ghoul fanboy. This show isn't perfect, but I fell in love with the story and characters right off the bat. The character development in this show was outstanding, it felt like they actually changed and went through hard times. There are a lot of shows out there were it feels like the main character never learns and is the same throughout the entire show. In tokyo ghoul almost every character changes, some less than others but still enough to tell. The art style was great and pleasing to look at. The animation itself felt lacking at times, but
                  overall was still great. The first season follows the manga very well, sadly the 2nd wasn't as close. I think if your interested in watching this show to give it a shot! Its not the perfect anime, I don't think there ever will be one. but if you like a deep story with great action than this is a perfect choice. My biggest fault with this show is that it wasn't fleshed out enough, looking at the series as a whole, its too short for what the manga had to offer and they missed out on a great opportunity for an amazing series, but other than that I love tokyo ghoul and would recommend it highly!",9
"
                *May Contain Spoilers*
This anime, originated from the manga, has a very good setting and story outline. The anime idea is incredible, but the show didn't quite make it. They didn't reach the full potential that this anime could have easily reached.
Story 5/10: The story is set in the present for the characters. There are a few flashbacks, but we are still left in the dust clueless about how everything happened. The anime only focused on two areas, despite mentioning other wards throughout the series. Confusing at first, then lots of action and plot during the anime. What brought this down was the ending, as viewers
                  are left with a major cliff hanger. The ending only made things confusing, and didn't give us many ideas to lead on. I also disliked how it ended despite a war still going on, so we don't know who won.
Art 8/10: I looove this type of art! It gives a slightly more realistic appearance, if that's even possible in anime. A bonus was the characters weren't given a perverted look, as many anime like to stretch that sexual approach. Haha!
Sound 10/10: The opening song is my favourite band for anime theme songs. I just adore TK! The music in the anime was very pleasing. I didn't stick around to hear the ending song, oops.
Character 3/10: We know close to nothing about the characters. The only character that really evolves is the main, but it isn't until the final episode. Some of the characters had great personalities, but the anime only showed 2 characters throughout the entire series. Would have loved to see more of the supporting characters!
Enjoyment 6/10: Despite having some of my favourite themes/songs/voice actors for anime, I really felt more like a zombie mindlessly watching the series played out. It doesn't give you much room to think and explore the story, and I was bored by the end of a few episodes. The reason this isn't a 1, is because of the visual and audio appeal.
Overall 5/10: Great setting and idea, but the anime just couldn't grasp many viewers enjoyment. I love how original this anime is, but would like to see an actual story :)

                Tokyo Ghoul huh The Edgyiest anime ever created by man, loved by fake depressed teens who want attention and shouldnt get it its truly mediocre in its narrative at best but great in other aspects.
STORY:4 
generic anime plot blah blah human vs monster but with an eva twist near the end extremely adgy and stupid.ART:8
The a is great i love the way the ghoul powers look and its really beautiful and satisfying to look at its pretty but also dark in its cityscape and the animation is great.
SOUND:8 
Good Voice acting and soundtrack its sounds are nice to hear all thought there is a bit of low quality sounds and weird sound mixing sometimes but its pretty good if in the grand scheme of things.
CHARACTERS:5
Edgy,Nervous kid with very stupid scenes and plot armour even his transformation was really edgy and almost felt like there was no personality like yea he said fuck you OMG GUYS HE CHANGED.
ENJOYMENT:6
Its art is great its story is meh and its fights are jam packed but one big issue pacing its so slow sometimes and its boring maybe its just me but i didnt find it to be that good and the fact thats it strays from the manga a bit and cuts stuff from it=6.
Overall Edgy Stupid Plot Armour and stupid pacing and really cool art and fight scenes = a total score of!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DRUM ROLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 6 yea a fucking 6.",6
"
                When I started watching Tokyo Ghoul, nobody told me that it'd ruin my life and making me cry by just thinking about it. That is an overstatement but by all means, but to me Tokyo Ghoul deserves it. Tokyo Ghoul is nowhere near perfect yet it's still my absolute favorite anime. Right after Hunter x Hunter. 
When I first started the show I knew it was good. When I was drawn in by the first episode I knew I was in for a good ride ( i was kind of wrong here ). I don't even know how I ended up finishing the first season
                  because I lost the concept of time while I watched it. The reason it got me so hard was that I LOVE psychological shows. Action scenes, all the brutality would mean nothing to me if they hadn't handled the characters the way they did. The way they blurred the line between the supposed good and the supposed evil and how it affected everyone is shown beautifully. That is why Kaneki will be always one of my top anime characters. 
When I finished the first season, I read the manga before I continued. If you look up the phrase ""just go read the manga"" in the Oxford Dictionary, you'll see the poster for Tokyo Ghoul. Everything i loved about the show was handled much more in depth and in quality in the manga. Going back to the second season after reading the manga was very disappointing to me.. But I didn't let it affect my view for the show solely because of how much I loved the characters and the potential the show had.
It did anger me, I knew Tokyo Ghoul could be much better if a company like Mad House did the anime instead. Tokyo Ghoul has a beautiful world that needed much more care and depth. For example, not just Kaneki but many other characters deserved to be shown more, to be handled in depth so that we the viewers could see their world and mind as well. Maybe it will be redone in the future, I hope so. 
I gave a 10 but that's my personal biased opinion. It probably deserves an 8 for the first season and 6 for the second season and 7 for the rest.",10
"
                I tried so hard to like this anime, and I desperately wanted to understand the hype of one of the biggest household names in anime. I'm generally not someone who rates stuff below a 7 very often, so it pains me to do this for something as renowned as this, but I believe it fully deserves this. Forgotten loose ends, poorly written and neglected characters, abandonment of basic worldbuilding, plot holes everywhere, and shit continuity between episodes are all things I can and usually do forgive as long as a show is fun to watch. Although it has a handful of fight scenes and cool
                  moments, almost none of it is building towards an overarching plot and everything feels sloppy.
Story 5/10: It's fine, it has a strong start and a basic but solid premise that would do a good job supporting a plot if one had developed on top of it. I can't comment on the story all that much, because there's nothing much to even comment on. Nothing happened except for the very last two episodes, and even then they didn't show you the outcome of the several different fights that started in the last episode. Super lazy writing, and again, basically nothing happened in the story besides some occasional action and everything ending back where it started, aside from the last 5 minutes.
Art 8/10: Twas good. The animation complimented everything nicely, and the different Ghoul's powers and abilities were creatively animated with awesome standout effects. Not much to say here, the designs of the Ghouls and weapons were cool but the characters and world didn't have much flavor or spice to them.
Sound 9/10: Envokes a great, powerful, and downright beautiful feeling of the struggle for purity in the souls of those forced to live in a world that corrupts, defiles, and destroys all those that desperately cling to their sanctity. Beyond a shadow of a doubt the best aspect of the show, and pulls the majority of the weight of drawing out your emotion in scenes where the writing just isn't strong enough to do it for you. I don't need to defend this, if you've seen this show or have not, you've already heard some of the soundtrack here or there just from spending time on the internet; Unravel has been dragged through the memetic cultural meat grinder more times than I can count over the better half of a decade, but that doesn't detract from it genuinely being an amazing piece of music and I think you can say the same for the rest of the OST as well.
Character 5/10: Aside from Gourmet and Jason being cartoonishly over the top and inconsistent, I don't think they're strictly any bad characters in this show, but they tried to develop all of them so they ended up developing none of them. We didn't get a conclusion for anyone except our MC, and even then it wasn't the conviction to fight for those he cared for and believed in that we'd been waiting to see, but instead, more of a total psychotic mental 180 from timid crybaby to unhinged edge lord. That's not character development. Don't even get me started on everyone else, we didn't even get to see what happened to them or where they ended up, the season just abruptly ends once our protagonist goes sicko mode and that's that.
Enjoyment 5/10: I didn't hate it, but it was super hard to get invested and just turn my brain off when nothing seemed to matter to the plot aside from the last two episodes. Our MC doesn't even properly fight someone till the very last episode, we know he trains and stuff (and presumably the other ghouls he works with do as well) but we never actually watch it happen or see his growth, and so many other little minor details the show just flat out ignores for whatever reason end up dragging it down and making it painful to watch.
Overall 6/10: A little bit of a trainwreck for everyone, if there's one common denominator behind all my issues with this show it's a complete and total lack of creative direction in every single department except audio/visuals. It tries to do everything instead of telling a story, developing interesting characters, or just being a fun action-packed superpower adventure and instead does nothing at, all right up until the very end. I've heard that they condensed around 60 chapters into this season, and it shows. I still can't figure out who it's trying to appeal to, maybe edgy middle schoolers and those new to anime, but those two groups are probably the same people. TLDR; the show is all over the place and it's rated decently higher than what I'd have expected, but from what I can tell it's generally a pretty respected title, so who knows; maybe I'm just missing out on a good show that doesn't quite reach me.",6

                Watch first 2 seasons, read summary for the rest.
---
The series have a strong Man vs Monster start, where both sides are likeable - you have ghouls with their cool powers, emo style, and tragic backstories, and then you have humans, who can go 1v1 with them, despite being... well, humans. 
Unfortunately, the show slowly turns into a Monster vs Monster, and Man is left somewhere on the sidelines. 
And while one could argue whether this made story boring or not, it's undeniable that battles took a hit. When a ghoul faced human investigator, there were some acrobatics, weapon play, and tactics, but when a ghoul
                  fights ghoul, the fight is basically ""jump on the wall -> jump on the ceiling -> poke torso with tail -> get pierced by enemy's tail -> regenerate -> repeat until one side can no longer regenerate"". Moreover, as the anime progresses, ghoul powers become more and more gimmicky, until it looks like they're using magic.
The first two seasons were a solid 8, the latter two were a 6, as the story became generic, and the setting lost its charm.
So my advice would be to watch the first 2 (to get cultured), and then read summary for the rest.",7
"
                I have to admit that I haven't read the manga yet, but based on the outline of the anime's story, the major plot focuses on the fact that the main character tries to accept and play out his fate. The cheap reason for Kaneki's fate consequentially occurred all because he wanted a date with a seemingly sweet and intellectual girl. But the story itself, deals with the mental support from the least of the likeliest places and the corruption in every being, human or ghoul. The animation is very explicit. I have to warn beforehand that there are several gruesome and disturbing scenes, but the
                  visual effects give a sense of realistic and expressive emotions. The soundtracks are energetic and pair with the visual scenes nicely. There isn't a major character development in the story other than Kaneki's acceptance of his fate. Overall, it was visually pleasing and worth watching for the psychological and passionate plot.",8
"
                I hate long reviews. And mostly review for future self-reflection's sake. 
Story is amazingly entertaining, with well fledged world building and societal structure in this world. Main theme of anime: hunger; self-acceptance; overcoming structural hardship. Animation looks great, hand drawn through and through. Anime opening and ending both now and at the time of ongoing release were huge successes. 
IMO, main anime purpose is to attract new audience towards source material (and earn some in the process), this anime accomplishes it perfectly. During weekly release, I jumped into manga and was a devoted fan till the end.
Excellent adaptation, manga's dark theme is well preserved, however,
                  some of minor actions scenes, like Appleseed's case, are animated at lower quality. Would strongly recommend this manga as it deserves to be one of last decades greatest stories. 
Recommendations of similar anime: 
Ajin: demihuman - a Fantasy story set in modern times, about systematical social injustice towards a minority group. Comparatively better portrayal of military and society's actions. A much grounded story with no generations long scheming.   
Jormungand - a Fantasy story set in modern times, about wartime orphan turned mercenary. Relatively realistic weaponry and mercenary group interactions. Gravity defying boobies. Realistically portrays MC (who hasn't received any formal education, and lacks common sense in many ways, in theory how most ghouls should be).",9
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is yet another example of a botched adaptation resulting from not enough time being given to properly tell the story. This series attempts to shove around 7 volumes worth of material into just 12 episodes and fails pretty miserably at it.
I should note that the issue I have with this adaptation isn't that  it doesn't follow the manga closely enough, it's that the characters are horribly underdeveloped because the show thinks it's more important to rush through plot points instead.
Let's take Kaneki, the main character, for example. His main struggle in the manga is that he's too weak to protect the people
                  he cares about because he's unwilling to make sacrifices in order to do so. Because the show rushes through so many events, the audience never gets to see Kaneki struggle, make decisions, or have any real bond with other characters. This version of Kaneki is a random weak loser who whines while he's powerless to stop the bad things that happen to him.
There are occasional worthwhile moments. It's fun to see certain fight scenes in animated form. The visuals for the kagune and quinque are especially appealing. Despite all of my issues with this series, I did still enjoy some parts.
If this show was around 8 episodes longer, it could have been good, but as it stands, Tokyo Ghoul is a a pretty barebones experience. If you're still interested, I'd recommend watching the first 2 or 3 episodes and then switching to the manga.",6
"
                This is one of those shows that you have to love blood.  It is so creepy and very gory in terms of how much blood it likes to splatter around.  It isn't gory like putting intestines in a blender by a serial killer type gory but it is very close too it in creepy level.  Personally, I tend to stay away from horror and this was on my holds list for like ever.  When I picked it up again, I realized it was one of those stories where even though you may want to just drop it because of how disgusting
                  and creepy crawly it is, you would still want to keep watching just to find out what's going to happen next.  
Character and sound wise, I am not a good judge of that so I just gave it a good score because I couldn't find any complaints with it.  
I usually just like to judge by how much I enjoyed it and how much I enjoyed the story.
Overall, if you like gory horror, it is definitely one to go for.  If you're like me, you don't like horror and gore but can't seem to pass up a good story...well, all I can say is good luck and enjoy.",9
"
                Very good anime but went downhill in Route A but got got better in Tokyo ghoul RE. If you are planning to watch it watch season 1 then season 3 skip season 2 because it’s not canon and it’s not that good.The manga though is very very good! The story is very engaging and interesting, if you like gory,horror and psychological shows this is definitely for you. Some people don’t think it’s a very good show because its there opinion and I accept that. Do not let young children watch this show or they will probably get very scared and paranoid. I hope this review
                  convinced you to watch the show. Highly recommended 10/10",10

                I have never read the manga. I obviously need to do so. Apparently the development actually happens in the books, and isn't lazily thrown together by Studio Perriot. At least according to my friends that have read the manga. Anyway, I scored this a five. While I do find this show mediocre, it somehow kept me watching. If the gore did it, then I was blissfully unaware of that fact, especially since most of it was censored.... The main issue with this show is the characters. Kaneki is a whiny little bitch for most of the season, and doesn't develop much until the last few
                  episodes. It's good to have setup for character development, but not to the point where you dangle it in front of us like we're fat people on treadmills. Maybe that's what kept me watching. Maybe I wanted to see Kaneki turn into the badass that's splattered everywhere on the internet. Touka seemed interesting, especially for a tsundere, but I'll be damned if she didn't turn out to be the most generic example of a fucking tsundere ever. Oh, she's actually really nice, but she's abrasive because of currently unspecified family issues. That whole thing has been done a thousand times, but almost never right. Remember Senjougahara from the Monogatari series? That's exactly the right way to do it. The family issues were a mystery for quite some time, but we knew of the existence of all of the family, and could actually care when the problems are brought into the spotlight. In Touka's case, her brother is sprung on us, with virtually no warning, unless I missed some dialogue. This makes me hate his character, even though the show seems to want me to relate to him. Suddenly, we get a character that is the inverse of the CCG, and little has been done to explain why he hates humans so much, so I can't exactly relate to anything he does or says. Yet he manages to have moral discussions with other characters like I'm supposed to give a flying fuck about what he has to say. Senjougahara gets over her abrasiveness towards Araragi, and her insults become cheeky and playful. Meanwhile, Touka continues to insult Kaneki for most of the season, and simply hates him for being a wimp, not that I blame her. In Monogatari, the show is self-aware of the generic tsundere they created, and actually has another character, Oshino Meme, affectionately refer to Senjougahara as ""Tsundere-chan."" Not only does Tokyo Ghoul not do that, it seems proud of it. Touka gets a lot of screentime compared to other characters, and it's almost never entertaining. The other characters are all introduced at lightning speed, and it's like a barrage of things to start caring about. 
That's enough about the idiotic decisions relating to the characters. Plot holes. Starting with the infamous teacup plot hole. Apparently, a kitchen knife cannot cut through Kaneki's skin, but broken glass can, somehow. Organ transplant, another infamous one. The doctor transplanting organs without the consent of next of kin is asinine; that puts everyone involved in the operation in the hotseat, and is far more dangerous than losing the biggest crybaby of all time. Mask nonsense. Ghouls that have been discovered by the CCG continue to wear masks, because they wouldn't look cool without them, even though those are probably inconvenient to breath in, and thus also annoying to move in. Tsukiyama bullshit. ""I'm Kaneki, let's go have tea with this strange man that Touka told me to avoid. I also don't pick up on social cues, and thus I do not realize that this guy is totally fucking pedo and should be avoided at all costs."" Oh, and this is all because they like the same author, which is the same reason he took Rize on that date, which got him into the situation he is currently in. Does your brain hurt from how mind-bogglingly stupid Kaneki is? 
The art and sound were pretty good. It's a shame a lot of the art was gore, and was heavily censored. 
Overall, I can say that there has been worse. Honestly, if they focused on developing characters instead of shoving all the content they possibly could into twelve episodes, Pierrot might be able to make a show that scores an 8/10 instead of a 5/10.",5

                Warning possible Spoilers
Tokyo Ghoul is definitely one of those anime's that deserves the praise it gets considering it's one of the top 10 anime's on MAL, but after watching it a second time there are some things that kinda make it's reputation a little flawed.
Story (8/10)
The story mainly centres on Ken Kaneki who is just a normal human until he gets caught with the Ghoul binge eater known as Rize, but after a surprising turn of events Ken manages to survive his encounter by sheer luck until he finds out he is now part Ghoul.
Now the best part of the story is the rivalry between
                  Humans and Ghouls you don't really know which side to pick since both sides have their reasons for fighting and the atrocities they commit on each other which is why Ken's role in these events is crucial because he is both human and ghoul which means there can be peace between the two or at least an agreement not to kill each other in horrible ways and for the most part it was very interesting seeing Ken's character change over time as he learns more about the Ghouls and the suffering they have to go through just to live a peaceful life which also makes him slowly turn into a stronger person.
The story is also very dark often showing the dark and cruel parts of each side like the harsh killings the CCG commits on Ghouls when they discover them especially when they encounter Hinami and her mother, but the Ghouls can also be horrific too like the secret underground arena that Shuu holds every once in a while or the horrible torture that Jason does to Kaneki so both sides do have their bad aspects, but there is also good aspects too which shows both sides can live together like when  Nishiki's human girlfriend Kimi allows him to take a bite out of her when he was starving or how Yoshimura is studying the way humans act so that Ghouls can live more peacefully around them so it isn't always doom and gloom with this show, but most of the time it can be pretty messed up.
Now the story does go along at a decent pace seeing as it is only 12 episodes and at first nicely separates the action and non-action moments as it allows our characters to flesh out a bit, but towards the end of the show it becomes a lot more actiony which isn't a bad thing since it was entertaining to watch it's the fact that the series ends on a cliffhanger is what annoys me because it means we have to wait, luckily the second season took less than a year to arrive, but that was probably a bad thing really.
Characters (8/10)
Now the main problem with Tokyo Ghoul is that it doesn't have bad characters it just has too many for us to take note of and this can make it a little confusing and spare little room for character development.
Ken Kaneki is the male MC and he starts out as a whiny, weak, scared and confused person, but as time goes on and he starts to understand his powers and the way Ghouls lives are he starts to become stronger and takes more risks to make sure people are safe since he wants to see a world where Ghouls and Humans can live peacefully together.
Touka Kirishima is the female MC, she is one of the main members at Anteiku and helps Kaneki learn how to be a Ghoul although at first she wasn't really into helping him and acted very tough and angry towards him, but over time she does start to open up to him more and becomes a much more likeable character especially considering she can kick ass very well too making her a badass character too.
Koutarou Amon and Kureo Mado are the main human characters of the show and work for the CCG, Amon takes his job very seriously and constantly works out to make sure he is strong enough to take on the Ghouls, but he also cares for his other CCG teammates as when one of them dies he always makes sure their death wasn't meaningless, while Mado on the other hand is a grizzled veteran at taking out Ghouls and he is pretty much that character you really hate because of his actions because despite his wise words he is absolutely insane when it comes to fighting and what he did to some of the characters was unforgivable so to me Mado isn't a bad character he's just really dislikeable.
Hinami Fueguchi is a young female Ghoul who is a very sweet person, but she is definitely the person you should feel sorry for the most because she ends up losing both her parents to the CCG, however this does make her into a stronger person by the end as it gives her a chance to learn more things that can help her survive plus she is a main reason why Kaneki wants peace between humans and ghouls because of the horrible stuff she went through.
Shuu Tsukiyama is one of those special Ghouls who likes the taste of his meal and might I say he is absolutely creepy seriously he sent shivers down my spine especially when he was either trying to fool Kaneki into following him or when he was ferociously sniffing a bloodstain he got from Kaneki yet surprisingly I didn't hate him I just wouldn't want to go near the fellow.
Rize Kamishiro is the ghoul whose organs were transplanted into Kaneki to save his life and she often plays mind tricks on him so she can control his Ghoul side and go on a binge eating spree again (luckily it doesn't work), but other than that she isn't really that much of an influence.
Now I know there is a lot more characters, but these are pretty much the most important ones and trust me there is a lot of characters to take note, some do die, but more are just introduced afterwards which just makes it even more difficult to take note of so the shows main drawback is the huge amount of characters on it's belt.
Art (9/10)
Now the artstyle was done very well I liked the dark tone it went for which suited the show very well especially when the situation turned sour and I also liked the design of the characters ranging from normal aspects like Kaneki and Touka to ridiculous colours like Shuu who seemed a bit like Hisoka from Hunter x Hunter, another good thing was the Ghouls Kagane which all had a nice variation and not just the same thing which also makes the Ghoul characters stand out a bit more since their Kagane's all have different abilities which makes the Ghouls a little more interesting.
Sound (9/10)
Now Tokyo Ghoul had a really good op not so sure about the ed, but the op is what will sell you on watching the anime, it nicely starts out calm and graceful and suddenly turns into a quicker beat making you get more pumped for the episode, but I also liked the colours that it used especially when it was showing Rize and Touka when they were against a black background and all you could see was their Kagane's.
Extras:
Now the action was done well and evenly spaced out so character development could be implemented, although most fights were short and sweet the action did slowly increase over time especially during the final episodes where it was nothing, but action however it really showed the true destructive power of the Ghoul's Kagane's and the enforcement that the CCG offers since they have Quinque's to put them on equal terms with the Ghouls.
Even though it says horror it isn't really that scary so it's more of a gore horror, but even then the gore isn't that bad so the show focuses more on the Psychological aspect which was done very well especially during the final episode when Kaneki is at his limit and his mind has fallen apart from the continuous torture, but the best part is where he starts questioning his way of life and how Rize says it's wrong and that it gets people killed and will only get worse so yeah what ep 12 showed was really good stuff.
Overall Tokyo Ghoul is certainly an enjoyable anime to watch aside from a few things like a cliffhanger ending and too many characters to keep track of, but other than that it is definitely a good anime worthy of you're time that is until you reach season 2.",8
"
                Pros:
The story was really outstanding and surprising, Ken Kaneki was the best character imo. The thing I liked about Yoshimura was that he always wanted people to understand consequences and wanted people to learn, even if it required alot of energy.
Cons: Many of the characters wasn't that good at acting tbh, Touka Kirishima was the worst character, her angry and depressing acting was horrible. The end was bad, and could instead turned into something good, but Ken Kaneki turned into an depressing guy, didn't match his character image.
Anyway, it was an pretty good story and anime, would recommend to anime users who likes fighting and
                  lifestyle.",8
"
                I originally watched this anime years ago and enjoyed it, reading a bit of the manga afterwards but dropping it.
Picked up the manga again not long ago and thoroughly enjoyed it, so decided to re-watch the anime. At first I was into it, loved the art and the manga coming to life, but then (and knowing this already after reading reviews) I started to notice the massive changes or complete exclusions from the manga and it really irked me.
Rolling eyes aside, it was still a good anime if you don't compare it to the manga too much, though you kinda have to read the manga
                  to understand where the story is actually going in the anime... Go figure. 
Maybe it's because I have a thing for attractive ghouls -cough- and gore and freaky eyes.
The story is below average unfortunately, skipping ahead and eliminating how they got there. The characters are underwhelming, only giving useless snippets of their past and how they came to be. The masks play a big role in the manga yet you don't learn anything about them in the anime. 
I want to LOVE this anime, but I can't. I still recommend it purely because I enjoyed the manga and it's an easy 12 episodes to get through. 
It's worth giving a crack.",8
"
                The anime is overhyped.
I think I watched the first half of the show for the music. 
The last three episodes were good, however, at the same time they were slow and fast-paced. 
The character development just didn't hit the spot for me. Not because the whole idea of I am not going to give in to the monster inside me isn't interesting, but because the execution butchered everything.
I don't know how they did it, but they succeeded in making Tokyo Ghoul boring.
I love the whole concept of the anime, but it left me unsatisfied. I wanted and expected more from every episode. 
I definitely won't be watching the second season. I will turn to the manga instead because I love the idea.",6
"
                Tokyo Ghoul was very thrilling to watch. I love the music and the art was very creative. It is definitely a good horror anime if your trying to find one. I like how Kaneki is this very basic guy and slowly becomes this bad ass character. I also like how all the characters are enjoyable to watch. My only concern is that Kaneki gets hurt almost every episode and it is almost over whelming. When you get towards the end, there is almost too much drama going on. But over all this anime is an 8/10 and is a really good horror manga/anime.
              ",8

                The story was haphazardly shown.  At times it felt like there should have been episodes between other episodes - continuity definitely took a hit.  The theme ties around one central character, Ken Kaneki, and is generally focused entirely on him.  The story was neither complex nor too simple - it just felt incomplete.  Imagine a show worth 50 episodes or more being shrunk down to 12 - that's Tokyo Ghoul in a nutshell.  However, the storyline itself is unique with subtle flavors of comedy and mystery thrown in.
The art is fairly generic and on par with other art found in
                  anime across the industry.  The backgrounds and scenery were well done and didn't take away from their scenes.  Character designs were unique and their personalities definitely differed.  The animations were also fluid and didn't feel choppy.
I watched the English DUB of the show and the voice acting wasn't bad at all.  Almost every voice actor fit their character well and didn't feel ""forced.""  The background music was well-made and both the intro and outros served their purpose.  Some of the louder heavy metal-ish music did throw me off but it was few and far between.
The characters weren't well-rounded.  The main character, Ken Kaneki, had the exact same disposition for the entire show save the last episode where there's a sudden plot twist.  The majority of the other characters also felt stagnant.  However, most of the character reactions seemed natural, albeit odd at times.  The villains had concrete aspirations and goals which made it fun to foreshadow future happenings.  Character count may have been overdone slightly - a few of the characters just didn't show up enough for their part to be meaningful to the storyline.
Overall, I enjoyed watching Tokyo Ghoul and would do so again in hindsight.  The gore may need to be toned down if there is any desire of achieving mainstream success outside of the anime scene - although I'm confident many non-anime fans will still enjoy the show.  Currently, I have no plans of re-watching Tokyo Ghoul but it isn't off the table.  I'll definitely keep this show in mind when watching future anime as a sort of benchmark standard for a ""decent"" anime.",6
"
                This review is based upon having read the manga first and it will contain some minor spoilers to use in examples to justify my reasoning for rating it the way I did. If you haven't read the manga and don't like or don't plan to read the manga I will still urge you to do so, but if you don't then the anime is fine to watch.
Story:
One of the biggest problems of the Tokyo Ghoul can be described as trying to fit 1 liter of water into a 0,5 liter glass. There's just so much of the story that has straight up been left out.
                  I could have somewhat understood if they only left out some dialogues that wouldn't have mattered that much, but even in scenes that are in the anime they chose to leave out minor characters like in the ghoul restaurant episode in which there are several humans alongside Kaneki that are going to be served. Leaving out even minor characters like these severely weakens the impact of the story in general. There are also story that is replaced by an ""anime only"" type version. An example of this would be Kanekis interaction with Banjo and his group including their escape attempt and due to this being removed its replaced with Banjo and an anime only couple working with Banjo being a clean up crew in the room Kaneki is tortured in. Not only does this severely reduce the impact of the couples death compared to who dies in the manga it also reduces the bond form with Banjo and the feeling of betrayal by knowing that Yamori didn't let Banjos group escape. Not only does this weaken the story, but it won't impact the viewers as much as the story to its fullest would have. 
As for the art aspect of the story the main issue is trying to make an R rated manga into a pg 13 anime by inane censorship. I can understand lessening gore as the animation costs would be quite hefty, but censorship is not the way to go. There's a reason for Tokyo Ghoul being classed as psychological and horror and to reduce the impact of this by censoring as much of it as you can is not good although this is a problem with anime in general. For example when Kaneki walks in on Hinami feeding that is supposed to affect the viewers as well, but instead you only get the reaction from Kaneki which doesn't impact the viewer as much if at all. To truly make an anime within the psychological and horror genres have impact you can't censor the things that are meant to have an impact on the viewers, it would be like making a porno with just massive black censorship boxes and still claim for it to be porn, it simply wont' have the same impact with censorship as it would have without it. In my opinion censorship has got to go in anime in general as it doesn't do anyone any good. 
Characters: 
The characters of Tokyo Ghoul are also essentially been reduced to rubble by various factors. The story is mainly at fault in this aspect as much of what is shaven off the story of the manga helps build the characters. Even minor dialogue and interactions help builds the characters and shows the viewer who they are, what they feel and so on. Due to the large amount of supporting characters that get backstories and have an impact on the story at least in the manga I feel like it would be wrong to have it almost dismissed in the anime as these supporting characters do not only have their own characters built up, but also help build the characters of the main characters.
Another massive factor that is absolutely laughable is the voice acting. Voice acting is extremely important to make characters come alive, but the voice acting in Tokyo Ghoul is sub par at best. Perhaps the most glaring voice acting flaw in this anime is that of Shu Tsukiyama. The reason for this is two-fold, the first is my biggest pet peeve in anime voice acting which is the pronunciation of non-english words which is something Tsukiyama does a lot and making him have some broken Japanese sounding version of the words is not going to cut it as it makes Tsukiyamas character seem like a moron. The other part is to capture the essence of the character from the manga which I will say can be difficult to achieve, but it seems like not much effort was made at all. The voice actors also seem to fail to truly capture the emotions of the characters as can clearly be noted in the torture scenes as Kanekis voice acting doesn't make you feel like its as bad as it is portrayed to be despite all the censorship.
Sound:
The choice of background music and the sounds used are also horrid although most of the time background music can be overlooked, but in certain scenes they are meant to capture the spirit of the situation which is something the music choice in Tokyo Ghoul has completely failed to do. The sound effects for the fights are not optimal either, but sounds can be overlooked for the most part if it hadn't been for this being a horrible adaptation. To make it even better both the OP and ED are horrible and don't catch the theme of Tokyo Ghoul at all.
Conclusion:
READ THE MANGA INSTEAD
If you absolutely hate manga or reading then you can watch this adaptation because as a stand alone it would have been ok.",3

                Tokyo ghoul 
Starting from the first season, Tokyo ghoul is and will always be one of my best anime series watched.
I must admit the studio did a great job on how realistic this show was features an exceptional and good pacing,  this show had me rewatching it because its not just an anime for entertainment but also have a good psychological influence. 
The plot is made to understand the life of a young 17 year old Ken, usually seen at the coffee shop tagged along by his best friend named hideyoshi nagachika. he got attacked by young lady(a ghoul) that he had interest in.
                  In the verge of his death she got killed by beams falling from above, he was operated by Dr kanou who did transplant her ghoul organs in him. 
His life was like hell from that moment until he meet a member of antieku coffee shop named touka. He had to work alongside them for a while and developed a good relationship between him and other members of antieku. He passed through hurdles there while he got to understand how ghouls live and make friends,  he got to understand that not all ghouls are the same.
An organization named CCG are forces that take out ghoul with the impression that they are human eating monsters.
Kaneki made it known to a member of the CCG named koutaro amon that the world is not only messed up by ghouls but humans and proved that ghouls are not all what people think they are.
He indeed made an impact in the hearts of his friends at antieku until he got captured by band of ghouls named 'aogiri'.on a mission to save kaneki, antieku fought hard, on other part, kaneki was forced to accept his ghoul nature 
He became so badass as he took a step to being strong and wanting to protect things he loved.he took out Jason who tortured him and came out victorious,from that moment he had it in mind and  decided to become stronger.
This show is not the one that only display how ghouls and humans fight but the kind of franchise that portray how ghouls and humans come together and help each other achieve peace and have a good relationship between each other. It's not all about killing each other but to an extent one can go to protect what belongs to him.",9
"
                Just a warning, this review contains some slight spoilers about the structure of the show and how certain characters progress (no actual events), so you probably shouldn't read this if you want to go in completely blind.
Ah, Tokyo Ghoul. Where to even begin with this one. Some of the most common words I hear about this show are that it's ""dark"", ""badass"", and most of all, ""edgy"". And I think a good way to describe this show is through the meaning of the word ""edgy"" itself. In my eyes, edginess is used to describe something overly dramatic in a dark sense to the point where
                  it's unrealistic enough to break immersion. Unfortunately for Tokyo Ghoul, despite doing everything else mostly right, it suffers quite a bit from this lack of realism.
STORY - 6.5/10
Let's start with some of the good stuff. The story revolves around a society built around humans and ghouls, which are humanoid creatures with weird powers that can only survive by eating people. I know, real pleasant. This dynamic created as a result of ghouls and humans living in the same world sparks some interesting discussions about discrimination, isolation, and best of all, the power of kindness. However, the story often feels forced into going in certain directions, not leaving enough time to properly foreshadow or develop big events. This starts happening especially near the end, and it takes quite a toll on character development. Which leads me to my next point....
CHARACTERS - 5.5/10
This was the weakest point of the show for me, and it's where the flaws in the writing really started to present themselves. Our protagonist is Ken Kaneki, the man who's worshipped around the globe by 12 year old boys and crushed on hardcore by 12 year old girls. Whenever this dude puts on his mask, panties drop so hard that....ok I'll stop. But yeah, this is the guy who gets the by far the most screen time, the most development, etc. He starts out pretty well as a nice kid at heart trying to fight off his harmful urges. So far so good, but there's a certain degree of ridiculousness in the way the show overdramatizes his inner conflict, to the point where I had to suppress my laughter. He keeps struggling with these urges for most of the show, and it doesn't really seem to get much worse or much better. That is, until near the end, where our boy undergoes some MASSIVE changes that are not just forced story-wise, but literally forced out of him by an outside influence. There's extremely little time to actually flesh out his development, and this causes his character to just feel unrealistic and inhuman, which is a shame since they'd been doing a fine job of showcasing his human side before then. As for the other characters, there's really not much to say. There are some nice ghouls, some mean ghouls, some nice humans, and some mean humans. There are also some of these who appear mean at first and later show caring sides, like say, Touka and Nishiki. But none of these are really developed beyond their personality traits. Now don't get me wrong, it's not all bad. The personalities of these characters are well defined and human-like, even in Kaneki (for most of the show). But in terms of development, there's definitely something left to be desired across the board.
ART - 7.3/10
The art in the show is the textbook definition of solid. Settings look realistic, fights are smooth and vibrant, and there's even some visual symbolism scattered throughout, which is always nice. Something that especially stood out to me was the art style for the characters. The people/ghouls look reallyyy good in this show. The dudes are hot and the girls are *hot*. That's all I really have to say, no complaints here but at the same time, nothing groundbreaking.
SOUND - 7.1/10
Soundtrack's also good. It fits nicely with the tone for each scene, and it never breaks the immersion of an impactful moment or fight. One track that stood out in particular was ""Licht und Schatten,"" and it added a nice amount of hype/emotion to every scene it was played in. As far as the opening goes, it's also pretty good, and it's super iconic so there's that. The ending didn't really stand out to me though. And voice acting, well, it did what it was supposed to do successfully, but as I said before some of our characters can be quite the drama queens.
OVERALL ENJOYMENT - 6.5/10
As a result of all of this I definitely ended up enjoying the show more often than not. The premise was fun to follow and think about, and the more than adequate production quality helped drive home the experience. Even the characters were enjoyable to watch, but their emotional moments didn't hit quite as hard as they could've if these characters had been written more carefully. So in the end, If you like a lot of dark and heavy drama and you can suspend some level of disbelief in regards to characters, chances are that you'll thoroughly enjoy this.",7
"
                Not your average horror or superpower series,  Tokyo Ghoul is a sincere attempt at exploring social prejudice and intergroup conflict with superbly compelling characters and a good enough story to support them. The emotions are often brilliant and strike right out at you, with a touch of realistic psychodynamics. It also happens to be one of the very few anime that at least tries to establish a biological basis for superpowers. Even with all these factors the series falls flat on its face due to the terrible worldbuilding and an extremely one dimensional plot. The problem with trying to tackle real world issues through
                  metaphors is that the metaphor itself distorts the picture too much to remain a valid metaphor. I will not get into the logical fallacies or faulty storytelling even though there is a substantial amount of those, and rather focus on the higher narrative problems that this kind of stories inevitably face, and writers continually ignore. 
If ghouls were a recent appearance then humans would leave Japan by the hundreds, probably prompting some emergency response by the government. The fact that there was no exodus or mass panic anywhere in the series proves that ghouls have been here for quite some time, with the humans kind of used to seeing them on the news. Yet the measures for preventing ghoul attacks is woefully inadequate- no radars, no constant surveillance, no special sensors that people carry or training that people undergo, not even tasers that so many girls nowadays carry against ""normal"" humans. This inadequacy points to the fact that ghouls must be a relatively recent phenomenon which hasn't scaled up much and people in general still don't think it can happen to them. Yet ghouls cannot be too recent an appearance either, since they have learnt to control their natures well enough so normal people can't even distinguish them from other humans. So what exactly is happening? And while we are at it what is the international scenario? Are ghouls a worldwide phenomenon? If so then there would be international alliances and task forces dedicated to taking ghouls down. If Ghouls are limited only to Japan then, sorry to say, Japan would just get nuked again. If ghouls are so integrated into human society that they so effectively masquerade as humans then it is highly unlikely in today's world that ghouls would stay limited only to Japan (just look at the Coronavirus), not to mention Japan would probably dominate the world by enlisting ghouls in the military (since as per the show ""good"" ghouls aren't exactly a rarity; and they can eat all the humans they like without the guilt or stigma). Other countries would keep sending agents to capture some samples for their own sinister purposes which would lead to Japan clashing with the entire world, or trading with them for other gains. All of these factors would significantly change the story but were ignored by the creators.
Let's talk about the metaphor itself. Ghouls and humans are two groups in conflict who, as per the sweet folks of Anteiku, can coexist peacefully. Ghouls overpower humans by physiology and humans overpower ghouls by numbers and modern weaponry (which for some reason ghouls don't use- I mean, sure Kagune is good and fine but grenades help too, man). Now try to imagine this in a faintly realistic world. Ghouls are creatures who eat humans and only humans, not to mention an average human has no chance against them. Why won't humans try to wipe out their entire existence? Ghouls attack humans, some of them binge eat, and even the most pacifistic ones like Yashimura assign hunting zones to ghouls where they can devour unsuspecting humans (ep01 epilogue). Sure Ghouls have feelings too and they have families too, but if you had potential cannibals in your colony who can any day attack your family would you not want them weeded out? If you saw a Ghoul kid attack your own kid would you not kill the Ghoul kid? Yes humans have tamed animals far stronger than themselves but our intelligence is far superior to those animals, something that is clearly not the case with Ghouls. Hence humans' fear and prejudice is understandable and is not merely a ""lack of understanding/empathy"" problem. The story provides no context or survey of overall Ghoul activity for the viewers to judge whether or not peaceful coexistence is at all possible. Let's try imagining a peaceful relationship between the two- for ghouls to have a regular diet without killing, humans would need to keep dying at a regular rate, and that too not by old age since dried old meat won't be very nourishing (assuming that humans would be okay with their loved ones getting eaten up after death). Ghouls would need to have a tiny population for humans to die off at an acceptable rate while sustaining Ghouls. So should they adopt some 2-child policy like China? Or would they allow cannibalism amongst themselves? And how would humans feel living with creatures who, at the very least, is simply waiting for more and more humans to die off? Even if they lived in gated segregated colonies where Ghouls couldn't reach humans they would still need a steady supply of human meat. Things could have been okay if Ghouls didn't need to eat humans but then viewers would clearly label the CCG as villains (like the Sentinels in X-Men). For viewers to empathize with both sides the writers needed to justify the humans too, but in doing so they ruined the metaphor entirely. This is what happens with all monster/beast stories that deal with social prejudice. What storytellers need to understand is that in the real world (i) the conflicting groups are not fundamentally different from each other, (ii) the marginalized communities do not have an inherent monstrous/carnivorous nature that they should ""control"" and (iii) there really isn't no justifiable reason for racism, sexism, religious bigotry etc. and the invaders/colonizers/purists/killers etc. are actually fucking assholes. Stop trying to portray both sides as somewhat justified and that neither side are villains when one side clearly is. By portraying the marginalized as monsters you are only adding to the prejudice rather than help reduce it. Watch District 9 for a proper usage of metaphor to portray racism.
As for the second metaphor, which is that people have a monster inside them that they have to learn to control, it doesn't work if the monster is present by birth (as in the case of most ghouls) or if the monster just appears out of a biological event (organ transplant) without any change in beliefs, morals, perspectives or value systems- none of which changes for Kaneki prior to his becoming a ghoul. It implies that the monsters were never human in the first place and cannot possibly ever be human again, because even in their best behaviour the Ghouls still have to devour humans. It could have worked if Ghouls could change into humans with effort but that possibility was not explored. No matter how compassionate Yashimura is he will still need to eat humans, and no matter how sadistic Mado is he will still never be a Ghoul. In the real world everybody is a potential monster and not just a particular race or unfortunate few. As per the story no human can turn into a ghoul without an organ(influence) from the Ghouls, but in the real world appropriate situations can turn anybody into a monster without the influence of any particular race. The show is essentially saying that people should be compassionate even to monsters, rather than exploring how our prejudices delude us into viewing normal human beings as monsters. 
Getting into the nature of Ghouls, the facts that Hinami inherited her Kagune from her parents and that Touka and Ayato have similar Kagunes point towards a clear genetic nature. Moreover, it functions like an organ compatible with humans since Rize's organs could be transplanted into Kaneki. Yet the few organs transplanted took over the entire body changing his digestive capacities, his sense of taste and smell, his eye colour (when he's hungry) and even supplied him with Rize's Kagune which he learned to use efficiently in quite a short time (when Nishiki was attacking Hide) without changing the cognitive/personality aspects of his being (once again the creators think that the mind is separate from the body). Even the Ghouls' genetic material is compatible with humans since Yoshimura had a perfectly healthy child with a human. So once again what exactly is going on? And why are humans their only possible diet? This is not simply nitpicking because the implications would have bearings on the story. There are two possible origins of ghouls, first that they are genetically modified organisms who were lab made at first. In that case who made them? For what purpose? And how did they get to proliferate so much and run amok in society? What are the initial creators doing now? How did some of the successful experiments turn out? Due to the total absence of any such ""creators"" I assume this is not the case. The second possibility is that ghouls are simply a further evolved form of humans, in which case it would be perfectly justified for them to be localized in a specific country (but then all the other factors previously mentioned would appear). Their evolution is of a specifically predatory type (since the Kagunes apparently have no other function than combat) making the humans totally justified in their attempt to wipe out their entire species. If one species becomes significantly more powerful than others it would dominate and oppress all other species. Isn't that what we humans did? If the Ghouls are so similar to humans then they can't be free of human evils either, right?
I have other points to talk about regarding the character design and story itself but maybe I'll do that in the Root A review- this is already my longest MAL review ever. The only reason I can criticize this series so much and get into such depths is because it actually tried telling a good story. I'd rather watch something that tried and failed than something that perfectly told a shit story. For that, thumbs up to Tokyo Ghoul. You may have failed, but at least you didn't sell out to stupid fanservice (of any kind). It isn't pretentious horror, it isn't gore porn, it isn't shitty shounen, it isn't pseudo-psychological thriller, it isn't ecci, it isn't comedy, the characters aren't exactly stupid, and it definitely isn't for passive viewers who just want to have a ""good time"" without any intellectual investment at all. So all in all, a good watch and highly recommended.",6

                *SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 1*
*REVIEW FOR TOKYO GHOUL*
P.D.: Haven't read the manga yet
Story (4/10):
Ok so except 3 or 4 episodes, the story is pretty weak and lacks emotion. The way Kaneki became ghoul makes 0 sense (a doctor transferred the ghoul organs from the girl to him?). Fortunately the series is saved by the last episode which is a 10/10 easily.
Animation & Art (9/10):
The animation isn't outstanding but the artistic style of the series sums points to this criterion. The last episode says it all.
Sound, Voice Acting & Music (8/10):
Okay I understand that the opening is a 10/10 but the soundtrack is pretty weak . The
                  voice acting is convincing but it could have been better.
Character (7/10):
Tokyo Ghoul manages to present some pretty-good-written characters that unfortunately fail to complete (or maybe save?) the mediocre story. The MC is very-well-built.
Overall, Tokyo Ghoul is a mediocre anime that must be watched by every anime enthusiast.
Recommendable only to anime enthuasists? : Yes, but there are little exceptions.
Genre: Drama, Action",6

                Ok for years I have been told about how good this anime was and I have seen a number of people dressed up as the characters at different Comic Cons. So I finally made the choice to check this show out. I have not read the manga but I hear nothing but great things about it. 
The show on the on the other hand has some issues and I don't think it holds up to the standard that the manga set. Now I am not going to say this is a terrible anime because it isn't. For me, the issue with this anime is that
                  it bounces around way too much and the holes in the story leave you asking more questions than the show answers. 
The characters are pretty well done although you really don't connect to any one character during the show. They introduce so many different characters that you kinda lose track of them all.  The main character (Kaneki) is almost unbearable in the first season as he is a total cry baby throughout most of the first 12 episodes. He does toughen up a little bit in season two after a horrible set of events that kinda forced him too. Still I never really connected with him in any way so when he gets hurt or suffers I really didn't  care very much.  While I did not enjoy Kaneki as much as I probably should have, his band of Ghoulish friends were a very fun bunch! I liked just about everyone in the coffee shop and really felt a connection to Touka. I was very disappointed when she had a diminished role in the second season. The other characters I really connected with were the kinda bad but also kinda good Ghoul Inspectors. Specifically, Amon and Akira were the two characters that left me wanting more. They had their fair share of episodes but I would have like to see more of their story. 
The Art for this show was definitely one of its highlights! This is a very gory show and there is a lot of blood and guts flying everywhere.(I mean its a show about people getting eaten so gore is expected) The overall dark tones and character designs really set this show apart from other animes. I really enjoyed the idea behind all the masks that the ghouls had to wear to hide from the inspectors. The masks set the ghouls apart and gave them each a very cool and unique identity. Kaneki of course has one of the coolest masks on the show. 
Overall: I would recommend this anime to anyone who loves a nice dark and gory show. The story does bounce around a lot and there are a lot of plot holes that just never get filled but this show is still worth checking out. I would recommend reading the manga first so you know what the heck is going on as I hear it fills in most of the plot holes from the show. Simi spoiler if you don't like abrupt endings I would avoid this one because the ending just comes out of now where and leaves you saying ""Wait there isn't another episode"". I had to go back and watch the last episode over again to really pick up on the fact that it was over.  
I would give this a solid 6 or 7 and say its worth checking out!!",6
"
                STORY: An amazingly good adaption taking in consideration the chapter-episode ratio. If you read the manga it's evident the pace is very fast. Although some moments are not on the same level of the manga it doesn't feel like anything too essential is left out. While the story as a whole isn't too damaged from the fast pace there are quite a few scene which don't do justice to the manga. Kaneki's torture, the raid on Aogiri and other little moments are not given enough time to let them sink in. Something positive about this adaption is that it totally cuts out all them dump-info
                  about how the kagune and quinques work. Despite being supposedly important the manga doesn't do a good job presenting all the info about ghouls hence why i think it was a good call to cut them out.
ART: The art of the manga is impossible to adapt, there is no discussion here imo. Even taking into consideration that it doesn't look they tried that hard or at least the result are not good. The comparison between manga and anime of the ""I'm a ghoul"" moment says it all. Regarding the animation I's say it's consistent, aside from a few stiff shot the action is good.
SOUND: 
CHARACTER: There isn't much to say about the characters. As i said about the story there hasn't been much time to let some moments sink in but at the same time nothing essential to the characterization of the cast is left out. As a result there is no difference from the source material aside Hide and Rize. The anime does a good job, I'd say far better than the manga, at portraying these two because it highlight some scene or even make them up fundamental to their character. In particular I liked the way Rize was shown during the first crisis of Kaneki as a ghoul, scenes not present in the manga. Regarding Hide it was shown more clearly that he knew about ghoul Kaneki and that he was actively tracking his actions and at the same time learning more about ghouls whereas in the manga it seems like he conveniently show up from nowhere when needed.
ENJOYMENT: The problems of this adaption come when you start to compare it to the manga. Doing that the question that comes to my mind immediately is: how much should an anime be loyal to the source material? The answer to this question is mostly subjective so imo to resume it all: 
As a stand-alone the Tokyo Ghoul anime is definitely a good series but it pales in almost all the aspect when compared to the manga.

                A beautiful show from beginning to end.
The first and second seasons are great. While the third and the fourth season are considered pretty bad in comparison to the first two, it's not at all right. 
Personally, I love this show. I agree that there are some inappropriate scenes but excluding those, this show has a perfect combination of suspense, drama, emotional scenes, and action. 
The author of Tokyo ghoul definitely knows how to make the audience cry. the music has also been picked carefully. Especially when the theme song plays during a fight, it gives you like a sudden boost of excitement. 
The anime was
                  one of the best till the 2nd season... I loved it, but after season 3 it became fuss. The story was moving at a rapid pace and missing important parts...
The *BABY MAKING* part was quite unexpected for me. Well, I hope you enjoy the show.",7
"
                What is the one anime where you think the biggest potential for it was lost?
Its a really debatable question but for me it has always been Tokyo Ghoul.
Tokyo Ghoul was the second anime i had watched and even when i was a 12 year old , i always fucking knew that it was a masterpiece. It was the first anime i cried at multiple times and it was just a story that was very gut wrenching. 
I still remember when i watched the Kaneki Torture Scene , i felt so fucking sad for Kaneki and the shit he had to go through. The sound and
                  desperation of Kaneki Begging Jason to stop really shines at how the voice acting and sound stood out and made the story more heartfelt.
The Art for 2014 standards was also really good. Whenever i see Touka's wings i always feel in awe at how beautiful it looks. The action scenes do not feel empty like most other shonen anime. Its like you feel the character in pain and its never bland.
The reason that Tokyo ghoul shines are the characters. I cannot stress how real these characters feel and how the CCG threatens their peace and their loved ones. I still tear up when i remember that Hinami lost her parents when they were literally trying to live normally.
It made me feel so helpless at times and that is something today's shonen can never accomplish , Making you feel miserable.
And the last episode..
God i get goosebumps thinking about my first time witnessing kaneki accept himself. Whoever decided to put unravel during that showdown with Jason needs a raise. It made me bawl out more than i needed to. 
And then came the garbage truck known as Tokyo Ghoul √ A , Tokyo Ghoul: re , Tokyo Ghoul: re Season 2.
I will not shit on those series individually but all i will say that it ruined the legacy and respect of one of the best mangakas in today's decade. 
Tokyo Ghoul could have been a respected series if it was adapted properly and i hate that this will be the final legacy of Sui Ishida. 
Needless to say , This is the anime that when it went downhill , it felt more personal.
I love season 1 and my love for it will never go.
I will do what people do best in this situation:-
READ THE FUCKING MANGA - Gigguk",9
"
                Not much to say honestly, I know what people think about this show and I know mistakes have been made during the making of the whole series, mostly in the last season, but that's not stopping me from giving it a whole 10 rating.
This have been my first anime ever and I can't forget how it made me feel, it's something special that maybe only a few people can understand, or maybe I'm just weird and only someone like me can appreciate this show.
That said it's still a 10, and forever it will, there's just some unspoken feelings and emotions behind every scene I can't
                  help but emphasize.",10

                [THIS IS AN OVERALL REVIEW OF THE WHOLE SERIES OF TOKYO GHOUL] 
                              [MINOR SPOILERS]
There is a lot to talk about Tokyo Ghoul. When i first started watchin' season 1 of Tokyo Ghoul i felt it was kinda murderous and blood-splattered and was a bit cringed watchin' the bloody scenes, but after completing watchin' 2 to 3 episodes of it, i clearly understood the concept and plot of the anime. I really enjoyed the concept of
                  Ghouls(if u don't know what is a Ghoul it is basically a human flesh-eating creature) in the anime.
There is a need to talk about the main protagonist of the anime KEN KANEKI... His character evolution from a lonely book nerd to a vicious strong Ghoul was shown extraordinarily... I enjoyed watchin' his screenplay  all the time in the anime... And yea he is one of the most good looking male characters in anime world... His slow development of strength was shown incredibly in the anime and i enjoyed every fight scene of Ken Kaneki in the anime...I really liked the way they showed Rize as a mentor of Kaneki in a Ghoul perspective...
Another character i really liked was Touka Kirishima... She was a character shown with incredible power at the beginning but then after one point her abilities weakened gradually and she was not shown much in screenplay from ""Tokyo Ghoul Root A""  till ""Tokyo Ghoul Re:"" but then she was given good screenplay in ""Tokyo Ghoul Re: The second season."" And yea i really enjoyed the conversation of rivalry  between Nishki and Touka, it was hilarious and enjoyable at the same time.
I really really really really LOVED the Soundtrack of the anime especially the song ""UNRAVEL"" by NK in the First season, it was the best anime song i ever heard !!! And the song for ""Tokyo Ghoul Re:"" with the song title namely ""Asphyxia"" was also a stunning song by Coshu Nie !! And of course we cant forget about ""Tokyo Ghoul Re: The Second Season's"" song ""Katharsis"" by NK again was dumbfounded by me. I mean all the songs of Tokyo Ghoul were Breathtakingly amazing !
And yea the animation was getting more better season to season!!!
AND I WOULD LIKE TO TELL HERE THAT ""KEN KANEKI IS ONE OF THE BEST DEVELOPED CHARACTER IN THE ANIME""
So if u need one word to describe Tokyo Ghoul then that word is ""INCREDIBLE"" !!!!!
 I highly recommend watchin' Tokyo Ghoul, a special recommendation for the ones who like the genres of Dark Fantasy and thriller.
I WOULD LIKE TO END MY REVIEW BY SAYING THAT TOKYO GHOUL IS WORTH HAVING A WATCH !!!!! SO GIVE IT A SHOT ! :)",8

"
                So back in the days of 2014 the only anime I saw was ""One Piece"" so I wanted to try out something new and tried to watch Tokyo Ghoul and I didn't like it all. 8 Years have passed since, and my perspective about anime is more expreinced, so I decided to give it a second chance.
So our main character Kaneki Ken is a normal 19 years old boy who just want to hang out with his friend Nagachika and read novel books 
And what do normal boys want naturally? yes, dating girls. So Kaneki had a date and like a cute,shy, and naiive boy,
                  he were excited for the date. It was a blind date and when Kaneki saw his match he got all goosebumps for how beutiful she were. Her name was Rize and she was astonishing. Kaneki thought it was a normal date but at the end of the evening it appeared that Rize were a ghoul, savages creatures who look and blend with the human society and feed on human flesh. Rize bit Kaneki and he became a ghoul that only craving for human meat.
This is the part were I personally looked deep into the anime and realized that everyone have their own problems and it doesn't matter what age you are or what is your status in life. Kaneki is struggling in life at this moment. He is only able to eat meat and he feels so depressed that every type of food in the world wanna makes him vomit. The anime did a great job at showing us how Gradiancelly Kaneki is being depressed and as a viewer you really felt his pain.
Usually in most animes, this is the part that after one episode the main character is getting his shit together and suddnly the problem is becoming a joke. That wasn't the case here. Through every episode since Kaneki became a ghoul his life is becoming shitteier and shitterier, People are trying to eat him, police are always after him, and he got turtured at some point also and all that just because he became something that he didn't even asked for. I really loved it that the anime showed us that not everything is good in life and that there's no limit to how life can betray you without you asking.
I don't want to keep spoiling, and this anime is not a must watch but it is definitally one to try and I enjoyed it a lot",7
"
                I really enjoyed the first season. In my opinion, the story opens many arcs to be developed, introducing many characters with mysteries to be worked out by the upcoming episodes. It develops quickly, we see all the changes through the protagonist's eyes, the gore is well used, the psychological horror is well used. The art is fantastic, the animation is great, most of the times, it works really well with the characters and sensations the anime wants to give us. The sound is enough, but nothing particularly outstanding, it really didn't stand out for me. The best thing about sound along with art was what
                  I saw in the first opening. The characters introduction is very good in the first season, most of them caught my attention, I was really interested to find out more about them, and they're very human, conflicting, with their own points and perceptions well expressed. I had a very good time watching, specially seeing the anime's world being built, I was really curious to know how things would end. In general, the first season was very good, as a first season, as an introduction of what enemies the protagonist will have to face, what the problems the story will approach and who will be the main characters working things out.",8
"
                Pros:
• A scientific basis for some of the key phenomenons, like the method used to hybridize the main character, as well as the simple things like a flesh & blood diet influencing a ghoul's strength (natural aversion to human foods)
• Emotions were portrayed very well, the main character was very expressive and had moments of genuine insanity (i.e. at the beginning with the realization and in the ending with the worm)
• The real protagonists (detectives) were not overpowered by ghouls and actually had some ""weapons"" up their arsenal (as opposed to the classic humans being overwhelmed and having to resort to using some kind of
                  double-agent)
• The character's development is well segmented, as to show the ""5 stages of grief"" that he goes through before reaching that ending, which serves as a prelude to the 2nd season that will most likely use that same formula but in reverse
• Satisfying sound effects in some moments (i.e. rain and wind such as in episode 10 during the meeting
• Satisfying level of gore
• Uncontrollable demon inside archetype
Cons:
• The main character is very frail and weak, both mentally and physically; as opposed to characters like Naruto or Ichigo who, despite being ""consummed"", are still strong-willed and physically strong outside of their inner-demon. It can be an intentional character design, but not one that I found enjoyable or well done. He's also very NPC-like until episode 8 where he seems to gain some actual purpose.
• The ending was horrible. The main ""villains"" were introduced way too late (last 2 episodes) and they were completely forgotten barely half an episode later. The attention was turned towards that random Jason psychopath, who had no apparent purpose other than torturing. They could have at least came up with something like extracting Rize. The invasion/battle starts, you see rudimentary fighting, the one-eyed Owl appear for a split second and then it turns into a pseudo-intellectual philosophical breakdown of the main character and turning his hair white.
• Fights seemed promising at first but got stale and limited very very fast; characters are hell-bent on using weak punches before finally unleashing their power and even then, their power seems like something out of a 12 years old's drawing book. Weird tentacles that don't have any clear reason for being the way they are, weird colors, and so forth. Rudimentary and rushed.
• I did not feel attached to the ghouls at all and I was siding completely with the CCG the whole time. Ghouls were not made to be likeable, but instead pitiful with no redeeming qualities (except the main char's plea and Touko's)
• No backstory is offered in regards to the origins of the ghouls, felt like you're missing part of the world building and the character isn't used to address that issue
• Trying too hard to turn it into a philosophical evil vs good, victimhood nonsense when it has nothing much to feed off in the first place, very forced
• Tries too hard to make the ghouls seem like victims rather than it being a genuine conflict between ghouls and humans (except for the very end)
• The show becomes very slow paced from episode 4 to 8
• Abrupt and odd cuts in key parts (i.e. first fight against Nishki and then against Tsukiyama)
• Art can be bland and childish at times, animation can be weak
• No character was likeable except Amon (young-man detective)
• The actual detective work was very rudimentary and just plugged in to put the detectives into context, but with no actual thriller or mystery
• Talks about ""S"" rated Ghouls but nothing much developed on those in-between, might as well just said ""the strongest"" if we don't get to explore the rest of the rankings
• The music is sometimes very unfitting in fighting scenes; the music overpowers the mild combat and creates a feeling of desync between audio and visual (i.e. Mado vs Touka)
Overall:
Good idea, rudimentary lore, odd pacing, weird cliff hangers, disappointing fights. Started off very strong, dipped and then restabilized but at a much lower level than the start. It was ""fair"" but had a lot of flaws.",7
"
                I watched this show when i was like 14, and i don't know man, from what i remember its like a 4-5. The best thing about it is the opening and now even that is just a meme. In retrospect kaneki seems very boring, especially once his hair turns white, along with the other characters, who's names i cant remember except for Touka, who reminds me of Mikasa but somehow worse? I gave it a five in case its not as bad as i remember, but to be honest i just want to bully this show for all the people that gave it 8's or
                  above. yuck. 
Addendum: i gave it a six on enjoyment, because i was a child. only children would enjoy it that much.",5
"
                Tokyo ghoul desperdicia bastante de su manga para hacer que todo pase en 12 capitulos lo cual funciona al principio pero a la larga se quedan bastantes cosas sin entender y que para eso obliga al que lo ve a leer el manga y poder entender lo que pasa en verdad.
Me parece que es el que mejores peleas tiene con la de kaneki vs jason o touka vs el gourmet. La banda sonora no esta mal aunque no es de esas que recordas por siempre o que la distinguis de la nada. Obviamente se come bastantes cosas del manga pero no tiene bastante impacto hasta
                  mucho despues ( Tokio ghoul re ).
Como anime me parece disfrutable con buenda banda sonora, buenas peleas y personajes meh.",6
"
                When I first started watching anime Tokyo Ghoul was one of the first anime that I got recommended. However, for various reasons I never watched it - untill 6 years later I started it on a whim
Even before starting the series I knew that the sequels were supposed to be ""Dogshit"". So even though it was immensely popular, I didn't come in with high expectation in regards for story or characters , and my expectations even then was barely fulfilled.
Story-6
The story of Tokyo Ghoul starts with an intersesting premise. Putting the main character right in the middle of the tense situation of humans and ghouls.
                  From there I thought this could lead to some interesting questions about the existence of the ghouls and if they can ever really co-exist with humans. I wanted to see Kaneki figuring out that ghouls have emotions just like humans and how he reacts and grows with that information. His peculiar situation as a half ghoul was also interesting. However the show never really touches on these matters. Kaneki just knows that ghouls have emotions and never really has any problem with that. The only thing he struggles with is his diet change - from coke to human flesh, but I felt even that was glossed over. His peculiarity only plays a role in making him stronger. The conflict between ghouls and humans would have been interesting if there was any other side than ghouls and humans. There are peaceful ghouls, aggressive ghouls and weird humans. There is also almost no measures taken by anyone to understand the other, the few exeptions are not conscious efforts, rather they are accidents. The plot is also very convenience based - thus making many things seem forced. Overall this is a generic storyline with a unique premise
Art and Sound-7/8
Good, I have no complaints
Characters-5
The characters are not very strong (as in developed)
Kaneki - Kaneki is a pretty boring MC. He is a reactive MC, who never makes any moves usually. He accidentally became a ghoul, met and joined the coffee shop and got kidnapped, Twice (or thrice- not sure about the Nishiki one). The only thing he did actively was help Touka in saving that kid, and thats it. His ""Development"" was forced in one episode with backstory and all and his ideology was changed, though the ideology was introduced like 5 min beforehand. Overall a boring MC
Kirishima- Perhaps my favorite of the bunch, Touka shows some character depth. She is strong and harsh but not cold hearted. She takes various decisions throughout the series that moves the plot. She is very human. She shows anger, regret, sadness more naturally than the othet characters. However most of these emotions are brought out by drastic things like death and murder and guilt of killing someone. So not very nuanced or subtle.
There is a best friend, a pedo, an old dude and a BDSM junkie other than the above
However I enjoyed the show a lot. Even though I can see the many problems plaguing this anime, I did enjoy the heck out of it. If you like gore or action then it is a fine watch. But its obvious flaws decreases the overall score.
Enjoyment - 8

                First of all, this anime is a bad anime made for adolescents and it didn't affect me anything. Let's look at its story first of all. It is not that bad about it, especially in anime, they have achieved a good job with using the music in the right place, it is not bad in the drawings, but the anime is not enjoyable at all, it did not give me pleasure while watching it is a drama action anime, but even the action is not nice, the action scenes are very mediocre. There is action in some episodes, but if there were better action scenes
                  that were too shallow, anime could have been better, combining these action scenes with good music, I think a bad anime was created for teenagers, I do not recommend this anime makes me sick.",6
"
                its been years since i watched this so i dont remember most of my issues with this anime but my biggest problem is that it lacks humanity. what do i mean? i mean often times characters react and behave in unrealistic ways. they will do things that, if they had any consistency, they wouldnt do. some characters who are portrayed as 'good' will turn around and do some absolutely immoral shit with no remorse. or an evil person will do ONE good thing and then be a good guy from that point on. ignore all the people they killed or lives they ruined or whatever
                  because they did this 1 semi-good thing on a whim. ridiculous. its the same problem i had with devilman crybaby. for example in one scene in devilman crybaby the mc who is the 'good' guy watches and does nothing as dozens of innocent people are being massacred. he has the ability to stop it and kill the perpetrator but he doesnt because the guy doing the killing used to be a good guy. or this girl who is a serial killer and eats people but switches sides, never addressing her atrocities, and everyone accepts her as one of the gang again. yet somehow, both of those anime are treated as masterpieces by many. i feel that some people judge a shows quality by its 'badass' factor. or more accurately 'edge' factor. i would like to use some examples from tokyo ghoul but its just been too long for me to remember any specific scene.
overall, if youre 14, give it a watch. youll like this anime. but for those of you who've grown up, give it a pass. there are plenty of other edgy anime that will scratch the same itch. try psycho pass.",1
"
                So I wouldn't say this season is inherently bad. Unfortunately, it ends in medias res and is connected to Tokyo Ghoul Route A, which is nuts.
Story
The story starts out decent, albeit cliche and with a lot of plotholes. The main character gets involved with ghouls and has to learn to deal with it, which is interesting to see, especially since he's such a pacifist. However, the story and powers are very inconsistent, new characters are introduced literally every episode, and we're meant to remember these 5 second cameos 10 episodes later. Also, Risei, what the fruit. :p
Art & sound was generally fine. I downloaded one
                  of the soundtracks, so that's a thing. The show is very gory and grim/realistic and it pulls it off well.
Characters
Another big drop is, like I mentioned, the fact there is a hundred characters with little to no backstory who get introduced and thrown away like popcorns. There's like 4 main villains in a 12 episode arc. Also, the plot armor is strong. Also-also, there is little to no development. Characters are the same from episode 1-12, with just 1 exception.
Enjoyment
It's one of those 'meh' anime you can watch in-between. It's alright, it has an interesting premise, but unfortunately it's unfinished and falls flat. On top of that, the 2nd season is ridiculously laughable, which drags this down.",5

                I will be reviewing the whole series here. The entire thing, including root A and season 2 and :re.
After reading the manga I think I can definitively say that that the criticism that this anime receives is unwarranted. The production team did an absoulute stellar job condensing nearly 400 chapters into a what, like 5-6 hours of actual footage? With the majority of it being fight scenes? That takes serious talent as a writer, artist, producer, you name it. There was no way that the anime would ever be able to fit in every single little detail, so you know what they did? They condensed
                  it. They merged some chapters together, which I won't name, you should just read the anime as well, as both are fantastic and only help you see the multiple sides to this story. 
I find that the manga is a ""helper"" to the anime, not the anime being an ""adaptation"" of the manga. The anime does a much better job of conveying the deep meanings of the manga. Where the manga gets lost in its overly excessive details which honestly I didn't bother reading. I don't really care about the power levels, the ratings, the ""kagune types"". Its just TMI and that is what the manga felt like OTHER than the chapters that actually bridged the gaps between root a and re.
The anime hits all the core parts, and even though it is not ""canon"" to the manga, it does a very very good job of actually getting the meaning and point of the manga across.
This is a story about a tragic hero, and it kept all of his character development nearly in tact from the manga, making the only things missing ""mostly"" extra little things here and there.
I also like how it jumps into Re without explaining anything. It forces the watcher to think about what is going on, to immerse themselves in a different, fresh perspective before diving back into the main story. Its almost like watching flashbacks in a movie, then being brought back into the main story.
Most of the criticism is how the anime left stuff out. Actually, the anime didn't leave anything out. There are moments that might seem like they come out of nowhere, but actually the anime turns them into flashbacks, rather than plot points in a chronological sense.  Other than a few points that were straight up merged from the manga into one episode and are definitely not canon, the anime covers every single part of the manga nearly word for word, and the parts that it changed, produce and even greater effect than the manga.
Spoiler: Example, when Ken caries Nagachika to the CCG in the anime (doesn't happen in the manga) THIS provides LOADS more emotional value than the manga did. The manga just kept on adding more fight scenes because you know, why not! The anime did a good job here, and took a chance to change the plot slightly to bring out even more tragic horror of the manga in a new light.
Anyways, that is all I have to say. I have only one spoiler here. I have watched this anime 3 times, and read the manga, so I can confidently say that this is by far my favorite story of all time, period. Its up there with the likes of harry potter, star wars, othello, king leer. It is truly a timeless classic about a tragic hero. There is not a single thing omitted. Their are no soft points, everything feels pained and sad, even the happy moments always felt like they weren't going to last. This anime is a must watch, and the manga is a must read if you want ""more details"", but over all 10/10, the anime did a splendid job of conveying the purpose for this work of art.
What is canon, is the purpose, the point, the meaning, the character development, the emotional roller coaster. Peace.",10
"
                the first couple of episodes i really thought the anime was just.. overrated. i didn't think the story was THAT much but i was wrong. In my opinion, it was a great anime, I am not really into harsh scenes in anime as i tend to be kind of sensitive but i liked it in this story as it is kind of the plot of it? ,the story itself is so.. addicting?? cause like you wanna know more about each character that is presented. like i wanna know back storys but sadly the anime doesn't really show that. also the soundtracks perfectly fitted with what
                  the scenes that are presented and the op is such a classic!!
The story is really great, i loved the soundtrack, the art is good, the animation is great, the characters are my favorite thing from the show.",9
"
                This show could have been wonderful if only some more effort was placed into character development.    Don't get me wrong, there was character development, but there was no ""journey"" there.    Development is all sudden and feels forced.   Another big problem is the characters get attached to each other but it all feels so quick.    If the show ran for a few more episodes it could have worked. 
However, I did love the last two episodes.    The last two episodes made me bump it up from a 3 to a 5. 
                     I won't spoil anything, but the last two episodes did make watching the series worth it for me.",5
"
                   The reason I finished this anime and not just dropped it, is bacause of its great sound -both opening and ending, screams, cracking bones and joints and lots of other cool stuff... The art is also very good except for the stupid censorship during the fight scenes. 
   The lack of character development is what really ruined this anime for me (there were some characters that I felt like they got robbed of  the spotlight, because there was no backstory given, therefore no way of anyone getting excited about them). Also the story... What a waste of a great
                  premise... During the show you can just feel that something is missing, that something is not being shown to you. I would compare this to jumping off of a plane, but instead of expiriencing the fall, you just end up smashed on the ground. The best of it was cut out.
   Nothing really stands out for me, except of previously mentioned sound and art. Anyhow I still recommend watching this show to form your own opinion. And if you try hard enough to fill in the gaps some characters are interesing.",6
"
                Tokyo Ghoul is one of my favorite mangas, and I really loved the potential that this anime had. Too bad even the 1st season was wasted to some degree. Anyway, I will try to write a spoiler free review.
The potential for the story in the anime was immense. Pretty much anyone would agree if they read the manga. It's just so good. However, even though season 1 is the best out of all 4, it still suffers. There were some minor changes but then there was a pretty big one when they switched the Shuu/Gourmet arc with another one. I found it much better in
                  the manga also because of the way Shuu was introduced. You could actually see him as a threat and be intimidated. Not so much in the anime where he just comes off weird and maybe even goofy. Everything else was ok I guess.(even though I'm still really pissed off that they didn't explain the part where kaneki cut his finger against the cup which if you read the manga, it would make more sense considering the earlier statements made about ghouls) So I guess I wont give it as low as a 6, but not more than a 7/10.
The art an animation was really good, and when I saw the first episode I got instantly hooked because of the theme itself. It can be so colorful and yet soo gloomy and dark. It knew how to find it's balance. Of course it could have been better at times, which is why it's an 7/10 for me.
The sound and voice acting in this anime is absolutely amazing. And let's not forget the opening and the main theme ""Unravel"" It became such a classic and even now I get chills listening to it. The sound and music in this anime is absolutely amazing. 8/10
The characters themselves are decent I guess. You have characters like Hide, Kuzen, Eto, Touka, Hinami and so many more that you just love to see them. But, then there are also characters like Shuu, the ccg and many others that you just get annoyed. Also later on some of the characters just grow even worse and worse, while very few of them get better. So I guess 6/10 ain't a bad score, especially when comparing to later characters.
The enjoyment is alright. I will say that they should have had more humor at times. Hell, there are a lot of times where it feels forced and simply not genuine so it just comes off as annoying. So you just watch this series without any real good laughs which is really important at times no matter the anime or theme it has. I'd say solid 6/10 is a good score for enjoyment.
Overall...I will give it a 7/10. Even the first season was mediocre. And while the manga got better and better as it went on, the same can't be said about the anime, like at all. In my honest opinion, this absolutely deserves a remake. It just makes me sad that it's left as where it is.",7
"
                Spoiler free.
please note that this review is exclusive to ""Season 1 of tokyo ghoul"" and not the entire tokyo ghoul anime.
Tokyo ghoul (Manga) is possibly one of the best pieces of fiction, but the anime is infamously not a great adaptation. but not because of the first season! the first Season is relatively amazing.
although I watched it years ago I still remember it well enough to write this review, and I remember it very fondly.
Concepts: 8/10
Tokyo ghoul has some quality concepts and ideas which lay the groundwork for a great story. the main idea behind the show can be compared to attack on titan. and
                  its world is interesting. there are multiple organizations at work both behind the scenes and on screen. and both ghouls and humans have a wide variety of weapons and assets at their disposal. designs are also great.
Story and plot: 8/10
TG S1 did its best to make the plot as interesting as possible with 12 episodes. it does its world building and has a lot of mini character arcs. but they are high quality. and it does a good job in holding everything together and moving the main plotline forward. has genuine great, beautiful, tragic and exciting moments. and the way the creators describe the situations and the scenes with their direction... you can actually feel the intensity, the suspense. the atmosphere is amazing.
it's dark, yet colorful.
Visuals: 8.5/10
The animation of tokyo ghoul is not the ultra detailed animation of mappa for AOT, but it's good in its own right. in combination with its art and effects, it creates beautiful scenes. 
designs are great, a lot of backgrounds and areas are beautiful, and has some beautiful artistic moments.
Action is also really enjoyable.
Sound: 10/10
Tokyo ghoul has some of my favorite OSTs of all time alongside AOT. some of them are not in season 1, but it's still amazing.
the music is not plain at all and actually has complexity, they are...different. I could say tokyo ghoul has it's own style with music similar to attack on titan.
Characters: 8/10
The characters are not developed a lot since this is S1, but as they are introduced and explored, each are really interesting in their own right. they are not boring, unnecessary and simple. they are intriguing and mysterious and unique and allow for interesting stories to be told. although if we were to talk about the entirety of tokyo ghoul, its characters are some of the most complex I've ever seen. specially Kaneki.
Ending: 9/10
no not the ending of tokyo ghoul, but the ending of S1! It's absolutely worth reviewing since it plays such an important role. I'm pretty sure it's a classic anime moment. the last episodes of the season are just to build up the ending of the season and to increase the intensity. and when it all ""unravels"" you will feel the chills. it's one of the most notable and significant moments of character development in the entire show. and possibly the first. and it's just so artistic and exciting and satisfying. honestly they could just make this season, and it could be an stand alone anime, they could just make this season, to encourage everybody to read the manga. and it could work perfectly. in this context it could be a masterpiece.
Overall: 8.5/10
As the first season of the show, it does a fairly good job. although tastes are different. so one might not like the musical style or something else about it. for me it has almost everything to make it great and enjoyable.
I'm actually not sure why it's a 7.8 , imo it doesn't do it justice. probably because the anime failed to properly adapt the manga, it influenced the ratings. or people just rate season 1 as a representation of the entire TG anime.",8

                I am new at writing reviwes so please excuse me if i make a mistake :)
*MIGHT BE SPOILERS*
Story: 5/10
In the city Tokyo the chaos is everywhere because of the creatures called ''Ghouls''  that are a cannibal kind of species and should eat human flesh to survive. Our main protaganist Kaneki notices a girl he  reading his favorite book and with his friend Hides pressure he asks her out. After some tim they spend time together but turns out the girl Kaneki went out with was a ghoul and he has fall right into her trap. Kaneki panics and hides in a construction, attacking
                  kaneki a bunch of big metal falls off and kills her. Some unknown time later he wakes up in a hospital with new organs because of the incident he had. He is happy to be alive but nothing will be normal like the old life he had.
Now ghouls are an interesting consept tbh but only if you can do it right and they pretty much handled it, the first season is about Kaneki learning about the life he have never known existed by ghouls. But the biggest problem is Kanekis power that he dont have control over, he is sometimes weak ,sometimes strong, sometimes determined, sometimes angry but he cant do a shit lets be real. He has NO actual character devolopment until the last ep of the season that is. Tsukiyama trying to eat Kaneki is a good plot too but it just lasts 2 eps and we dont know what happened to him until they try to help Kaneki escape  from the Aogiri, it is teh same thing with the masks too it is told like it was an imposrtant thing but its just to make characters look cooler or quirky or something. It had so much potential with story of this season but it is what it is.
Art: 8/10 
Ghouls are actually good designed and character designs are fit for their personality.
Sound: 8/10
The effects of kagunes are good and dramatic effects are nice.
Character: 6/10 (i will not talk about every one of them)
Kaneki: He is the main protaganist and a crybaby, one of the worst character type ever (for example Izuku Midoriya). He always cries with or without a reason and thinks ghouls are heartless monsters but after the incident he gets organ transform from Rize (the girl she went out to a date with that is actually a ghoul) and because he has now ghoul organs in his body after the surgery he cant eat normal food because it tastes really bad to ghouls so he must eat human flesh. He refuses to do it because he thinks he will turn into a monster like all the other ghouls, he is depressed and wont go outside. His best friend Hide pressures him to go outside and Kaneki finally listens to him so he goes outside, not a long time later he realizes he is HUNGRY. Kaneki smells something really tasty and finds out a ghoul eating human then gets attacked by Nishio so we are introduced to Touka! Now lets talk more about Kaneki; after a while as a human/ghoul he starts working at a place called anteiku  where ghoul and real customers come to drink coffee, he actually has 1 character devolopment that is understanding ghouls better and better every day he is working in anteiku. It is actually a good plot for the character, someone weak, fearsome becoming stronger and more determined every day is a classic consept but it is good. It is like kaneki gets stronger and stronger that more he learns about a life he have never know with the pain he never feeled to be a ghoul, it creates a great dramatic plot iwth Kaneki as the main.So kaneki can be an awful and an amazing character at the same time as he learns more.
Touka: She is the badass character when introduced in the scene where Kaneki is getting attack by Nishio. Compared to Kaneki her scenes are way more emotional and dramatic. Toukas mother and father has died leaving Touka only her brother which would become an Aogiri member and nemesises with Touka. She just wants peace in her life and hates being a ghoul like the scene where she asks ''How does it feel to eat a cake? Humans enjoy it right?'' and that shows how much she admires humans. Even tho she dont like who she is it is natural for someone wanting to survive in the cruel world of ghouls. With the stress of running from CCG
Touka is also a student with a great friend which is really important for her, she just wants to live with peace and be happy like every human out there. Touka is one of the best character in the show and makes it way more ''Dramatic'' than it is without her in the show. As I am saying she is used really well for the plot with the character devolopment she has.
Hide: He is Kanekis best friend since they were kids, one day when they were small Kaneki was reading a book alone and Hide wanted to make friends with him so they become friends. Hide has a good perspective to things and an extrovert who always want to help others. He is like that big brother that forces you to do something but it is for your good everything he does. He is a really hardworking guy and is always wholesome which dont have enough screen time it deserves. In the first season we only see him on couple of episodes sitting on Anteiku talking to Kaneki, thats it.
I would love to see him more but an other wasted character in the series.
Enjoyment: 7/10
The ghouls were really interesting and i enjoyed some of the plot its was enjoyable but not good enough
Overall: 6/10 
It has good and bad plot, good and bad characters its is not pathetic but it is not a good anime either...",6
"
                Human figures that eat humans BUT most importantly LOVE COFFEE, mega respect for the coffee part got to say. I personally could not live without it. 🤣
But on to the actual review: I really enjoyed this anime series, especially before sleeping. The story line was very interesting especially got lit when Kaneki went through his 'transformation', I love dark characters!
At the start I had some off review on the anime with Kaneki being a nerd and all but the further I watched the more interesting the series got.
I would recommend watching this if you enjoy some thriller with a taste of investigation type thing, additionally
                  with some fighting.",8
"
                I don't have much to say about this anime at all.
This is all my subjective opinion.
Tokyo Ghoul felt like ""the"" anime.
I can Imagine that AOT must feel the same way, but I haven't tried watching it yet.
Tokyo Ghoul is the Anime of anime.
The first thing that comes to mind when someone asks me-""What is anime?"", are a few of my favourites and Tokyo Ghoul.
Tokyo Ghoul felt like an anime for the purpose of being an anime.
It didn't feel like anything in particular, it just felt like ""anime"" in the sense of the word.
Never ONCE did I think about what exactly I was watching, all that
                  I knew about it, was that it was an anime, and that I liked it.
That's it.
To be honest I would've posted this on r/anime if I wasn't a lazy asshole, so yeah, here I am...
The art was pretty ok, felt jagged at times. But to be honest it is a pretty dated anime.
The sound was actually not that bad, most anime have this ""average"" sound, while this anime for some reason managed to deliver while only a little, but still above the ""average"" level.
I'm not going to talk about the story here, but it is pretty interesting and if i'm not wrong, one of a kind. (Creds to the manga.)
The characters were also pretty interesting and attention grabbing, almost each one of them was memorable in some way.
The enjoyment was a solid 9.
Yeah, remember:
This is my subjective opinion.
And yeah, this is a low effort review.
I just watched the anime, and again, this is kinda one of those ""obligatory"" reviews.
I do want to note that I kind of needed to get this out of my system.
Thank you for your time.",8
"
                I watched the anime knowing very well how poorly adapted it is but I wanted to watch it for myself to know how bad it was that people said so much about it. As I have read the manga before I can tell the production team Studio Pierrot messed it up. 
Story - 3/10
They squeezed 66 chapters into a mere 12 episodes. Basically, a summary, and obviously they skipped a lot and added scenes that were not in the manga. But that doesn't improve the story whatsoever.
Additional scenes if I may remember
1 - Rize and Yamori already met in the first scene first episode but
                  never met.
2 - Yamori knowing Hinami's father Fueguchi which I didn't know existed before.
3 - Investigators Mado and Amon fighting with Yamori. 
Art - 5/10
The animation could've been better, but given its Studio Pierrot, I don't expect anything from them. But I like the last fight scene between Kaneki and Yamori with 'unravel' playing as the BGM which seemed like their entire budget went only there. And I also don't know the reason why the art is so bright? Seemed like their hairs are glowing? wth? with that 'I'm a Ghoul' that was so lame way to say it.
Sound - 7/10
I loved how Kaneki's voice changed after he accepted his ghoul side. The voice cast was good and the main reason for me to watch it cause I knew the story was no good in the anime so I watched it for their voices but it did disappoint me. I wanted to know how Kaneki would sound when he accepts his ghoul side or when he fights but yeah whatever. Also, there's unravel OP which I liked as well.
Character - 3/10
They didn't show anything. I don't know what's happening.
Enjoyment - 3/10
I didn't enjoy it all but I didn't skip an episode. I watched all 12 episodes.
Overall - 4/10
I would recommend you to read both the manga, Tokyo Ghoul and the sequel, :re.",4
"
                Tokyo ghoul was an amazing anime. It is definitely in my top favorites. I would 100% recommend this anime to anyone. The plot is pretty similar to Demon slayer too but just with ghouls instead. It's a very unique plot and doesn't show the same stuff every episode like some shows. I love the character diversity and how the story is so well thought out. Kaneki goes through so much and changes throughout the seasons. I love so many of the characters and their personalities, such as, Kaneki, Juuzou, Ayato, Touka, Hide, and sooo many more! The opening is also very cool. The opening shows
                  all the characters and their human and or their ghoul form.If you haven't already watched it, I would totally recommend it! Also if your into cosplay, it has some amazing characters that you will love.",8
"
                It was good for the majority of this season, I enjoyed it...until it hit the end.
I'm sorry, I do not think I will write a lot for this but rather point out why I chose to give it a lower rating.
Now the plot was captivating. Of course I do not mind some gore and horror as long as the story carries well. But when it hit the end point...if I recall correctly it was Kaneki's decision that made me go ""what?? why??"" and so I was quite upset about that. Of course, if you are telling me if he never made that decision the story
                  won't go on...
I acknowledge this is deep and a lot of stuff happens to poor Kaneki which in the end he has suffered a whole tonne which he did not deserve! 
In my opinion, this was probably dragging the story along? I just hoped for something better in the end. 
If you're deciding whether you should watch or not...well it is up to you. It is worth an experience which I do not regret. Everyone's tastes are different. 
Just...disappointed that's all. Can't even continue watching the rest of the other seasons.",5
"
                I have watched this anime around three times now, and each time it's gotten progressively worse. I don't know if it's because I've matured and moved on from the ""mainstream"" anime I used to watch. Either way, my feelings toward this anime have changed, so it's time for another re-review.
Tokyo Ghoul. This anime was a depressing show to watch again, given I went into it knowing what to expect, but feel completely different now that I'm done. It's a lot darker, depressing, and much more edgy than I once remember it being. Most of the notable characters here all start out with this trope-y ""badass""
                  vibe that gives you this feeling of ""oh god, why are they so edgy."" Then, back off over time with that feeling, almost leveling out and showing nearly zero signs of progression in their character.
Of course, this isn't true for all characters, Kaneki, for example, does have some decent character progression, but only after being tortured for who knows how long. Which, if I may add, the latter half of the anime has terrible pacing and I really feel like they were trying to tell two stories at the same time, but only ever focusing on Kaneki. 
I dunno, I feel weird giving it such a lower score now, but I can't help but feel jaded from shows that force the ""badass, edgy"" vibe, then turn sour with a giant cliffhanger at the end. It's tiring and bored. Of course, this is an older show, which is why  I still think it's decent for what it's worth, but please don't expect more than it's worth. I recommend you go into this with low expectations, and the willpower to watch some brutal moments.",6
"
                Tokyo ghoul, watched it before a bit and people kept shitting on the adaptation so I read the manga. It is a show about a young man called kaneki.
He tried to eat a girl out but ended up being the one eaten, basically, we live in a society where certain humans aren't really humans but ghouls which eat humans and cannot enjoy normal food because of an enzyme they got. One of their eyes turn black and well they go apeshit. So like I was saying kaneki was dating a girl and well she was a hollow, kinda like STDs but instead of an STD
                  kaneki became a half hollow and instantly a mega pussy- Well look they wanted to make it as realistic as possible and I liked that, that is a very normal reaction if one was actually experiencing what happened to him. He cries a lot and they try to pass this depression-like feelings to the viewer alongside action, violence and ghouls. The whole thing is just ghouls Vs themselves and humans, nothing crazy but I really enjoyed the whole emotion thing going on.
Well then, would give the story a 7, the manga had many more details and was a little different but for 60 chapters to be adapted into 12 episodes like this..Well they had what they needed to and nothing more.
Art, the art style is original and looks good, the quality is great and it overall looks good. 8/10
The sound is an 8, the opening was good and so was the ending. Get used to this kind of songs and also these just sound amazing. 
Characters..ehh like a 7 or 8, 7.5 but in reality a 7, they had so many things that had to be done but only some really were done, some characters just feel wrong and they needed more depth.
Overall this anime wanted more precision and care put into it, this studio clearly wanted to farm the popular manga and try to persuade new people with the nice art and music. 7/10 would read the manga but watching this anime is not a bad choice.",7

                Tokyo ghoul has a lot of flaws but i'm going to start with the positives.
It has a phenomenal soundtrack in my opinion specifically the opening 'unravel' and another song off the OST called 'White Silence'.
The first episode is very strong but sadly the first episode is the best episode.
After the first episode everything else seems to fall flat. The episodes following have a habit of opening up a plot but then forgetting the plot and not bringing it up again so it makes the show feel disconnected. I've read some of the manga and will say that it does a lot better job of not
                  doing this with it's plot.
I feel like if Tokyo ghoul was given 24 episodes rather than 12 they would have had more time to really flesh out there plot because the show isn't complete garbage it just feels very empty.
I'd still recommend watching it if you have any down time it's a pretty quick watch and the first episode and some of the scenes towards the end make it worth your time.",6
"
                I don't even know where to start... I've must have watched shy of 50 different anime series in my life. This is by far the worst.
Everything is trash. The characters? trash. The story? trash. Anything that would be worth mentioning here is a copy-paste of every anime stereotype ever, but with a abysmal render... There is no character development. there is no character at all actually. Not only does he not achieve anything he doesn't even make the plot move forward.
Up until episode 5, the story is... ok. Episode 6 is an absolute waste of time and 7 to 12 are discombobulated. the rhythm changes
                  to a point where each episode feels like you missed one. The artistic direction goes through the f*&*&! window. Some times it feel like a psychological drama, sometimes it feels like a comedy. and none of them are good.
Worst time to ever be suggested to me.",2
"
                This imo is one of the best anime ever made. First, the character development is crazy good. Kaneki started off as some average teen then turns into a ghoul (I call it his pre ghoul form)
and then his full ghoul form and all those different times in kaneki's life he was different. The supporting characters are also amazing. They really help out kaneki and just add to the story. The ending is badass where he turns the tables on jason and makes him the one being tortured and then just walks off into the cold night. Overall this show is a 9/10 and if you
                  haven't seen this you need to.",9

                Story: Hearing about Tokyo Ghoul prior to actually watching it, I imagined a trivial conflict among humans and some sort of monsters. I was surprised to discover that it was much more than that! It's true, there is a conflict between humans and ""ghouls""—creatures who eat human flesh. We could even draw a parallel between ghouls and vampires if we didn't have a fundamental difference: as far as we know vampires feed on blood, not necessarily human blood though. Ghouls, on the other hand, cannot survive without human flesh. And that's where Tokyo Ghoul starts being interesting: a vampire can refrain from drinking human blood,
                  if they want to, because they can replace it with the blood of other living creatures; a ghoul cannot replace the human flesh! Consequently, can we still label ghouls as vile creatures, when eating humans is their only way to survive? Don't ghouls have the same right to live as human beings do? This would be a first debate that may turn out quite challenging, especially since the author presented the two races in such a manner that you cannot easily say that ghouls are completely wicked, nor that humans are as innocent and good-natured as one may think. In fact, the drama is so well built that it makes it impossible to take a final decision about who is right and who is wrong, if you are fairly honest with yourself. The second aspect that particularly impressed me was how the inner conflict was illustrated, especially in the main character's case. I'll be honest: I don't think I've seen a better representation of it in any other anime (even movie) from up until now. The only reason I haven't given the story a 10/10 is some imbalance in its evolution. More than half of the series, things progress very slowly, becoming very accelerated toward the final. As a result, some aspects remain unclear, with a sore feeling of being left hanging. 
Characters: I loved the main character Ken Kaneki, especially the way he confronted himself and the changes in his life! However, I was a bit disappointed in his sudden transformation  at the series' end. What bothered me was not that I considered the abruptness exaggerated or impossible, but in this particular case, it  caused me a feeling of confusion about the character. Another interesting character—whose development was flawless according to my personal standards—was Kaneki's friend Hideyoshi Nagachika. It's true that Hide is not a central character, but this makes me appreciate the author's talent even more; I don't find it easy to make an auxiliary character interesting. Unfortunately, I must confess the rest of the characters didn't impress me that much; on the contrary, I felt a little bit bothered by the ridiculously exaggerated traits of some of the characters: Rize Kamishiro, ""The Gourmet"", Jason, Suzuya Juuzo, etc.
Graphics/Animation: Generally, I was satisfied with both animation and graphics. Some elements that I particularly liked were: Kaneki's mask which illustrated so well the divergence from his inner self; the way how the reactions of two very different characters, also making part of opposite factions, were presented in parallel. Not only that the scenes were so smoothly intertwined that it made you think the two characters were in the same stage setting, but this combination was so expressive in showing that both factions were undeniably right!
Soundtrack: I've heard that the soundtrack of this anime was highly appreciated by a lot of people. It is for this reason that I find it rather difficult to confess I didn't like it one bit! The music didn't only induce a depressive mood, but on some occasions it sounded like it had a broken rhythm, which irritated me. I have the habit of faithfully watching the openings and endings; this time was painful 😂! I would have rated it worse than 6/10, but I had to admit that the soundtrack illustrated so well the drama and tension of the movie, making me feel so vividly the atmosphere of the story! It's certainly not bad music; my dislike is only due to personal tastes.",8
"
                This anime feels like watching something on 5x speed and taking with someone on the phone so you missing half of the content.
Story by itsef is not by any mean bad, I could even say that the idea itself is very interesting and quite original. 
I truly believe, that manga have better character and story development.
Anyway, anime feels like they just wanted to get on hype train that manga made, but they had only month to made script, animation etc.
All characters is unikeable and it's very hard to symphatize with them. They are like marionettes without their puppet master.
Art, compare to manga is very poor
                  and looks like it was made by someone, who never saw source material. 
Overall, if you want to get into Tokyo Ghoul, try to read manga first, because you might dissapoint yourself.",3
"
                So I'll be completely honest. 
Tokyo ghoul is a a quite deep anime, and you will only come to like it if you're open minded. It has the potential to be so much better, but the problem is the loopholes, and quick pace. These problems start from season 2 so if you want you can go ahead with season 1. Personally, I loved the both re: seasons, i only dislike season 2 of Tokyo ghoul. The animation and fight scenes are amazing, and so are the characters (everyone is so pretty XD). The story isn't the best but the openings and music is amazing. There
                  aren't many plot twists. What i would suggest, is the manga. preferably watch Tokyo ghoul after you've read the manga. 
-zeri",8
"
                watch this anime because i was kind of bored. however i feel that the whole execution is kind of subpar. i think the story plot is okay just it didn't execute well. 
for me, the most annoying and irritating to watch in an anime are dumbass characters, especially when the stupidity is applied to the main character. always crying, whining, asking for help because they are so freaking weak and useless, and totally can't do anything to help the hell out of themselves.
an example is the guy in this character where he only became stronger and able to fight at the very last episode. so,
                  from this you know it is not the end of the anime, and will continue to the next season. arrgh~~ and i have a feeling there will be a lot of death in this anime too.",5

                NO SPOLIERS
Tokyo Ghoul is a good anime, didn´t read the manga (which i´ve heard is waaaaaaay better than the anime adaptation). It has a great idea and an original way of developing it, as the anime starts it builds up pretty good, promesing an exciting anime. The thing with Tokyo Ghoul is that  it feels like they tried to fit a great idea into 12 episodes because they couldn´t afford more. As a consequence i feel it leaves much to be desired, the plot could´ve been way more developed and the characters better constructed. Overall tokyo ghoul is a very good anime, it's very
                  entertaining, the message it transmits is pretty cool, and has a great ending that leaves you wanting more. 
ps. the second season kind of sucks, so if you liked the anime i'd recomend you to not watch the second season (i know it's hard, and you're not going to listen to me anyway haha so at least i warned you )",8
"
                You might be like ""tokyo ghouls shit fuck that mann"" and honestly fair enough Tokyo ghoul does seriously go downhill as the anime started to pass the source material and then they had to go back to the source material and bla bla bla it was a whole mess. 
The first season of Toyko Ghoul is actually really good and definitely worth the watch as long as you watch seasons one, two and forget the rest exists the show is fantastic.
If you are genuinely interested in the plot of Tokyo Ghoul save yourself the trouble and just read the manga after the first two seasons.
If
                  you cannot sing unravel perfectly then you are a walking L.",8
"
                Number of Episodes: 24 episodes (about 20 minutes an episode)
Plot: C *Ken Kaneki, a college student, goes on a date with a girl from a coffee shop named Rize Kamishiro who ends up being a ghoul. Ghouls look exactly like humans but with the main difference being that they can only live off of human flesh and they have super-human strength and a special predatory organ called a kagune that comes out of their bodies which they can attack with. Rize attempts to devour Kaneki but dies before she can kill him putting Kaneki into a critical condition. The police arrive at the scene fast
                  enough to transport Kaneki to the hospital and by some miracle, perform an organ transplant putting Rize's ghoul organs into Kaneki's body which effectively turns him into some sort of half-ghoul hybrid without the doctors or anyone else knowing. The show follows Kaneki as he learns how to adjust to his new lifestyle and how he tries to unite the ghouls that are hiding in plain sight in society with the prejudiced humans who look at them as being monsters. The plot of this show is pretty damn ridiculous filled with lots of over-the-top fights, but that's Shonen for you. Also, the show shares a lot of similarities with Parasyte. But I think Parasyte takes the idea of a protagonist starting out as a human and due to some freak accident becoming a half-human-half monster into a more interesting direction with much better character development both from the protagonist and from the villains as well.
Visuals: B *Nice character designs, the fights are interesting and gory as hell. The atmosphere is dark and moody so many of the scenes reflect it. And in the earlier episodes, they take the time to have silent scenes where characters are brooding when music is playing which was nice. Not too many anime shows take the time to do that.
Voice Acting: B- *Hmmmm I wonder if the sub would have been the better choice. Kaneki's voice is really grating and it's bad enough that he's a typical edgy whiny protagonist. But I guess the good news is, he probably speaks 20 words of dialogue total in season 2 so I didn't have to deal with that anymore. At first I was annoyed by Hinami's voice, but it really grew on me once she stopped crying and saying ""mommy"" every five seconds. All the other voices were fine with my favorite being Shuu Tsukiyama who was probably my favorite character. I've noticed I tend to really like the extravagant and flamboyant male characters who have large personalities and are obsessed with the protagonists of each show for some reason.
Film Score/Soundtrack: Probably the one aspect of the show that deserves some sort of praise. The music whether or not I always liked it was always interesting and set the tone of the series. And there were some action sequences that the music enhances making the fights seem more interesting and dramatic despite me not caring for the characters.
***My favorite track:
Characters: D *I have the same problem with Tokyo Ghoul that I do with Akame ga Kill. The writers seem to think that if we have likable characters on both sides, the fights will be more interesting and dramatic. While that works in Game of Thrones because it is a morally grey world, Tokyo Ghoul and Akame ga Kill are a lot more black and white than Game of Thrones was (at its peak anyway. I won't speak of it towards it's end). No matter how they try to paint the picture, the Aogiri Ghouls are just plain evil and the ethics of the Counter Ghoul Unit is so messed up and oversimplified that you'd be insane to root for them. So that leaves the Antique Coffee shop as the main team to root for and even then outside of Hinami and I guess Touka do I really care about any of them? Kaneki started off as your typical edgy protagonist, but then after going through extreme torture, he decides to... team up with the guys that tortured him so he can protect his friends? It doesn't really make any sense, and he kills a lot of people in the process.
Cringeworthy Anime Moments: This is a Shonen which means get ready for a lot of ridiculous fight scenes. But besides that, I guess I am thankful that there is very little fanservice. There are shows that are more offensive in this category than others, but because the characters are poorly written and the plot doesn't go very far exploring the dynamic between humans and ghouls in society other than from the perspective of the ghoul's in Antique or the Commission of Counter Ghoul (seriously that was the name they came up with?)
Opening Titles:
Season 1 Unravel: An interesting whisper-like song that evolves into a super catchy and memorable intro. It reminds me of a the YouTuber akageorge also known as George Barnett whose music I really enjoy.
Season 2 Munou: Once again, the intro is an interesting choice with a lot of fluctuating in the theme making it both hard to call catchy but it is indeed memorable as the tempo changes so much in such a short span of time which I suppose is fitting for the abstract and bizarre imagery that accompanies it.
Closing Titles:
Season 1 OPANIMEND: Another experimental and interesting choice. Not really my style, but the transitions are interesting.
Season 2: Root A Ending: Easily the most traditional and normal anime title track that they play. It's an upbeat pop-rock song with a catchy piano melody to start the track off which builds up to a memorable chorus and a bunch of other instrumentation. Easily my favorite of the 4 and part of the reason why I stuck with the show until the end.
Final Verdict: Season 1 I gave a 4/10 Season 2 got significantly worse with its problems and I rate it a 3/10. The show had it's moments that made me think it was going to become something good, such as the torture sequence in the season 1 finale with the excellent flashbacks and Kaneki's psyche being under attack, but it went in such an odd direction after that which made me care less and less for the characters that I already didn't care for.",4

                Very minor spoilers that won't ruin anything.
Tokyo Ghoul is something I place as an Action/Drama, but it usually fails at these points. It's a bummer because it does some things pretty well. It just also totally misses the mark on important attributes, namely characters. 
Story: 6
The story is, in a vacuum, not very good. Most of the progressions in the story are motivated by factors outside the main characters' control, so it really feels like stuff is just 'happening'. This is really is not compelling for an audience. But honestly, the show does a pretty decent job with building forward momentum before the actions. You
                  can tell what the show is building towards, so it doesn't feel like random stuff is happening. It would just be better if these chunks were better connected. For example, the show roughly follows this scheme:
Gourmet mini-arc -> Fueguchi mini-arc -> Aogiri Tree mini-arc.
The audience can feel forward momentum within each of these chunks, but no connection between any of them beyond the persistence of the characters. 
Another big hurting point is the ending. The final episode isn't even a bad episode... it's just a bad FINAL episode. There's a lot happening before the final episode with a few parties of characters, and the final episode just focuses on one. It's a giant cliff hanger. And sure, it makes sense if they want this to be a long-running series... but I'm not watching another season. So it's just a drag. 
Art: 7
Tough to rate this one. There's a lot of good and bad. When it looks good, it looks good. The art direction is pretty sound. The thematics are nice; a lot of the scenery is trendy and modern. But often when action is happening, the trendy vibes get traded in for a strong gothic atmosphere. It's a good contrast. It's also nice to see a change in pace with the casual direction to keep up with city-living trends and lifestyle. 
The character designs are generally good. In the promo material, it looked like each character was very aligned with a particular color... if that makes sense. It's not so stark in the actual series, but I may have honestly preferred it that way, even if it's a bit 'cliche'. That being said, many characters just don't stand out at all. 
The action scenes are generally creatively choreographed and have the right amount of bite to them, despite censoring the usual suspects. Sometimes they get very choppy though. I feel like skimping on FPS is a common problem for this series.
Alright, well, it sucks because the art isn't always good. A lot of scenes with lazy animation. I don't really know what causes this. Just less skilled animators on less focal scenes, I guess. But yeah, the animation suffers pretty frequently. Just, when it pulls itself together, it looks pretty good. I would say that it's tough to gauge what happens with animation behind the scenes. Their budget and time constraints are going to have a huge impact on quality. And just like most shows these days without mold-breaking art direction, there's some ugly CGI. It does not make or break but... can just get rid of it already?
Sound: 9
OP is great. ED is forgettable. I think the score is actually pretty nice. Nothing stands out and there are no crazy motifs, but the score does a great job to emphasize or cut the momentum of the scene. In terms of effects and voice-acting... It's fine. It is definitely more good than bad, but nothing to write home about. Sometimes the mixing feels off. 
Character:  3
...Yikes. Every single character is a wet blanket. It's uh... Bad. For a show that spends most of its time promoting dramatic elements, you need to have good characters. A lot of characters have back stories, but that it. They're just there. They don't even seem to align with their backstories that well either. We don't know much about Touka's backstory, but it seems like she is supposed to be a hard worker that prizes peace and generosity. But she gives Taneki shade the entire show and is easily consumed by revenge. Taneki has some character scenes in the last episode. They are good scenes, but it doesn't resonate at all because Taneki is a piece of cardboard with no discernable character traits besides pacifism, likes to read, and onii-chan-ability. Those are the main characters. The main characters! The side characters have no development and are just role-fillers. There is one side character with development but he does nothing after his spotlight. Characters are baaaaad. Design is decent.  I'll give them that. But no proper exposition. 
Enjoyment: 4
I mean most of the show is devoted to things 'happening' and decent attempts at dramatic tension which fail due to paper-mache characters. I didn't hate it, but I definitely didn't enjoy it. I would not watch this series again and will not watch the second season. The only thing to enjoy would be the action scenes, and they are only passable really. 
Overall: 6
Alright, for an attempt at a long-running series with a 12 episode starter, it did fine. Poor characters just totally derailed what could have been like... a good show. It -is- close to a good show. Better characters and cleaned up animation/more story continuity would probably land this at an 8. I could give this show a 5 or a 4 though. Enjoyment is the most important thing, and this show didn't deliver for me.",6
"
                To be quite honest I watched this show in high school and forgot most of the details plot wise. However, I remember I loved the concept and artwork as well as the overall story when I was watching it. I even attempted the manga when I was finished watching. However, I believe some of the characters are a bit lackluster and the plot could be more cohesive than what I remember. 
I do believe this is a staple into entering the anime experience, and if you're too sensitive for your own good like me you will cry at the end even if the rest of
                  the plot doesn't grab your attention.",7
"
                *spoiler warning*
The thing about Tokyo Ghoul is that it doesn't know what to do for itself.
It fails to world-build this amazing and horrible city, doesn't explain much on how the city works, the CCG, the ghoul and human dynamic, it doesn't pay attention to any of these details and doesn't do a good job to execute what is so great potentially.
It fails to create a strong MC that feels like an MC. Kaneki is someone that we follow and we pity but during his arc, there is nothing to root for within him because he ultimately disappoints us time and time again. He is such
                  a weak MC that it feels like we're on his side just because we see him suffer and meet all these people who are horrible to him. 
Emotional impacts were terrible. They were so forced upon us and they weren't subtle in any way. Nothing could prepare us for the amounts of sudden flashbacks to things that were never hinted at before, just awful and putting us out of place for no reason, just to come back and force us to cry but really, it's a cheap move. All deaths were like this.
The other characters are pretty interesting but aren't given much to work with. There seems to be such an imbalance between us getting to know the villains and the side characters and also the MC, it's so stretched out and slow yet it gives us literally nothing for any of these people.
The way they introduced and created the villains were not great. For example, Amon wasn't given much until episode 7 or 8 and by that time it feels really rushed and pointless for us to start caring about his character. I think that if Amon and Jason and the Aogiri Tree Clan were the main and important villains then they should be getting some spotlight and some backstory since episode 2 and 3 at least. But they didn't so when the ultimate showdown happens, we are only seeing them as villains and not as an actual person/entity that we could sympathize and root for.
Everything just seemed clumsy and messy, and i would have rated this even lower if not for the last 10 minutes of the series. Yet again, perhaps it does deserve a lower rank for how much of an easy way out the ending was. It was definitely a disappointment that made me want to give up on watching anime for a while, it was that unenjoyable.",4
"
Story-9
The story in the first season of Tokyo Ghoul was fantastic, not once was I bored or uninterested in the story, everything going on made sense on why it was going on and was just very very good. The concept in Tokyo Ghoul is also just stellar.
Art-10
The animation itself is about a 9 or 8 but the art style was phenomenal, the Kagune (superpowers for the ghouls) are designed to perfection and just look so cool, the character design was also very distinct and recognizable.  
Sound-10
The ost to Tokyo Ghoul is one of the greatest I've ever heard, every piece of music is outstanding
                  and I could have the entire soundtrack in one playlist and I'd listen to them for hours on end. Unravel by Ling Tosite Sigure is just exceptional and is my third favourite Anime opening of all time.
Character-9 
The main cast of characters are very good, Ken Kaneki is one of my favourite protagonists in anime and was a huge reason why is adore this season so much, the character development that goes through this season for him was outstanding. Touka was a really good side character and I cared about what happened to these characters. On the flip side, there are some forgettable characters here too, the main villain was very scary but not too compelling or all that memorable. And most of the side characters were kinda boring but since the lead characters (Kaneki, Touka, Mado and Amon) were so good I can't give this anything lower than a 9/10.   
Enjoyment-10
The first episode is my favourite beginning episode to any anime ever and it competes with my favourite anime episode of all time, everything is set up but not too in your face about it and the twist at the end of the episode had me shook after the first time I saw it. everything in the middle was still amazing and I had a huge smile on my face the whole time on my first time rewatching it. The last episode was just as good as the first episode with one of the best fights in anime ever with Kaneki vs Jason and a very satisfying conclusion.  
Overall-10
Tokyo Ghoul was my favourite anime of all time (until I saw Hunter X Hunter) because of this season, without this season the show would not be very good at all to be honest. It is definitely not for everybody and if you read the manga you would probably be disappointed, personally I couldn't get through the manga because I am not much of a manga reader and I just find them a little boring even though I can admit they are better in terms of story. I saw the anime first and was immediately in love with it, anyone who is into horror and great character development I am confident they would enjoy Tokyo Ghoul.",10
