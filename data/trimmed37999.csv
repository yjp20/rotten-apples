                Every season there is one entry the anime community overhypes beyond belief and this time it's Kaguya sama.
Story? There’s no story beyond two teen high schoolers failed love attempts at getting the other person to confess. Fans have dubbed Kaguya sama as the ""Death Note of romance"", which is laughable because the mind games here are pretentious, basic tactics. 
The comedy is hit or miss most of the time, with the odd joke being able to crack a smile from me. The jokes and gags are repetitive and become stale e.g. the skit where the President and Kaguya gave love advice dragged on too long.
                  The episode about the wiener joke (no, I’m not kidding) was so childish.
The characters are a bunch of troupes who receive no character development: Kaguya is a rich, childish, pampered tsundere with barely any endearing qualities. Chika is the cute ditsy airhead, Ishigami is the depressed emo okatu that fans relate to calling him ""our guy"". He's easily the worst character because of how one dimensional he is and all his jokes being so predictable e.g. ""oh no, Kaguya is going to kill me! I'm going home President!"". The president is the hardworking and studious guy. He’s the best of the main cast in my opinion. He's the most interesting, relatable and got varied comedy. 
The main problem with this show is the narration. The narrator might as well be his own character with how overused it is, to the point it becomes overbearing and annoying. The writer clearly didn't grasp the concept of ""show, don't tell"" because i don't want to be told about the characters and their thought process like they’re puppets. I don’t know why the narrator is keeping score of their matches because it ultimately amounts to nothing and we get the same rinse-repeat scenario next episode. He’s often mentioning stuff that’s obvious on screen with info dumps, which is jarring because it comes across as if the viewer is too stupid to think for themselves.
I’ll give it to A1, the animation is great, the osts are good and the stylistic presentation is visually impressive enough for you to overlook most scenes taking place in one location. The opening visuals are creative, however the opening song is cheesy and the ending is forgettable.
Overall, Kaguya sama is a fun rom-com, but it's cliche and filled with troupes that would otherwise be criticised in other shows. The dynamic between the two leads doesn’t change as they are no closer to confessing to each other than they were at beginning. It's baffling to see so many positive reviews and the amount of praise it’s received when it lacks substance and does nothing special compared to other rom-coms.",4

                Confessing love to someone is one of the most intimidating challenges we face in our lives. 
Kaguya-sama: Love is War takes this relatable fear to the extreme. This anime isn't your average rom-com; it's a fight to the death between two stubborn geniuses in a battle of who will confess first. Kaguya Shinomiya is the wealthy heir to a corporate enterprise, a prodigy of course, but sheltered, with far more pride than common sense. Her adversary, Miyuki Shirogane, comes from a much more humble background, a workaholic to reach the top of his class, but unfortunately, he has little experience with anything else. Despite wildly
                  different upbringings, they share many things in common; stubbornness, unrivaled intelligence, egos more inflated than two hot air balloons, and they're both hopelessly in love.
Rather than merely confessing, they use their intellect for schemes to make the other confess their love first. Fear rejection is too much for their overly inflated egos to handle—this makes their attempts to trick each other over-the-top and hilarious. Still, the underlying motivations of their outrageous scheming are heartfelt. It's always evident that they're in love. Whenever they come close to confessing, they immediately fall deep into their egotistical personas and shrug it off. 
Truthfully, I should hate Kaguya-sama. I prefer romances that focus on development and believable relationships—rather than awkward interactions until they finally confess in the final episode. Kaguya-sama's main appeal is cringe-worthy teasing, and it's abundantly clear we won't get a confession anytime soon. Albeit with the stakes raised so high that its psychological warfare is comparable to Death Note. You may think a premise as simple as this would grow tiresome. Still, it continues to raise the stakes. The directing is phenomenal. People often complain that nothing changes through the series—but they're overlooking details. The relationship gradually progresses, and each chapter has permanence. The student council room changes, past conversations are referenced all the time, and their attitudes change. Kaguya and Shirogane start as very cold, keeping conversation to a minimum, then they become more open with their personal lives. Of course, they retain their professionalism. Another complaint is that the jokes are repetitive; this isn't entirely offbase. As the show progresses, each characters' sense of humor changes. They begin to understand each other more; as such, their banter becomes more personal. 
Each character fulfills a distinct comedic role. Shirogane, the student council president, and Kaguya, his vice, both at the top of their class, are always the center of their school's attention. They're geniuses but also crazy in love with each other. The supporting cast and even the narrator add so much more to the comedy. They all have fantastic chemistry with one another. Even the smallest mannerisms and reactions put you into the character's mind, conveyed through close-ups and internal monologues—this clues us in on how each of them feels, from a wild comedic display to a subtle emotional response.
Chika, the student council secretary, is the embodiment of chaos and the straight man in the comedy routine. She unknowingly intervenes in the intense battles between Kaguya and Shirogane to hilarious effect. Although she acts airheaded, she's intelligent, talented, and has more life experience than both of the leads combined. Then there's the always anxious student council treasurer, Ishigami, who makes a late appearance in the show. He's likable for his long-running gags and banter with Kaguya. We often see Kaguya and Miyuki's nefarious strategizing from the side characters' perspective, revealing how ridiculous they both look. It gives the show a welcoming sense of self-awareness. 
Every joke lands with a powerful impact because of the audiovisual feedback. Every sound effect is pitch-perfect. The melodic orchestral music constantly changes to complement wild tone shifts; it's nothing short of brilliant. The opening credits beautifully showcase the cast and the exaggerated mind games with an aesthetic reminiscent of studio Shaft. The theme song is so damn good; it is unlike anything else in anime nowadays. The third episode's notable ending credits are impressive, too. Chika's dance was rotoscoped with expert detail rarely seen in big-budget productions. Talent like this is hard to come by. The artist, Nagisa Sugao, must have days animating that one-and-a-half minutes of intricate animation. She not only came up with the dance herself; she performed it to get replicated with animation. If that's not the ideal blend of talent and passion, I don't know what is.
What elevates Kaguya-sama's great comedy material far above any other rom-com is the exceptional directing from Shinichi Omata, among other industry experts. Known for his work on Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, he brings brilliant storyboards, a considerate eye for framing, dynamic direction, and creative budget distribution that takes what could have been an average adaptation to the best this season has to offer. This anime's excellence is thanks to perfect production management. Even with as little animation as this show has, there is always something moving onscreen. If a shot lingers, it's to highlight emotions without any dialogue, like the moment Kaguya admired her nail polish on the way to the club. It's brief, but it tells us exactly what she's thinking. 
Scenes blend into each other seamlessly. Objects fade into one another—and the transitions never break the 180-degree film rule. I counted more than a dozen match cuts in a single episode; The level of detail put into storyboarding each cut is impressive. I have nothing but admiration for the director. Background art transforms to reflect the character's inner monologue's mood, indicating how they overthink even the simplest of exchanges. The breathtaking animation only gets used to highlight pivotal moments, such as when Kaguya and Miyuki come close to kissing. Emotional character-development moments are highly memorable because of this extra attention to detail. 
Omata employs a frenetic style to emphasize punchlines and give importance to every bit of dialogue. Reality occasionally bends to create incredible and abstract visuals, which makes potentially mundane punchlines incredibly intense. These moments reflect just how exaggerated the crazed characters perceive their mind games to be. On the far end, the show straddles the line between slapstick comedy and an all-out thriller with static lines overlaying close-ups as a character verges closer to defeat in a battle; this is what makes Kaguya-sama so funny. Kaguya and Miyuki have astronomical IQs, but they use their intelligence to do the most idiotic things because they're afraid of having their hearts broken. It's so painfully relatable. The mind games they get lost in are entertaining, but they're so misguided in their approach to love that even their failures are hilarious to watch. They're both walking catastrophes. Thankfully the show acknowledges this and pokes fun at them through irony and sarcastic supporting characters. Its visual excitement, music, and wildly contrasting tones craft a dynamic comedic experience. 
Confessing your love for someone is terrifying. Growing up is an even more formidable challenge. Kaguya and Miyuki are slowly but surely navigating through their complicated emotions. Masterfully timed jokes, expert directing, and relatable characters—this show has it all. No matter if you love or hate anime romcoms, this takes the standard genre tropes and subverts them in new and exciting ways. Kaguya-sama: Love is War is an outstanding series that anyone can walk away from wholeheartedly adoring.",9
"
                To describe Kaguya-sama: Love is War as a battlefield of love, between two prideful geniuses, who see confessing as a sign of “weakness” is well—sort of misleading.
Not because these type of scenarios don’t happen throughout the show, but more so because I’m not entirely sure that it is accurate to describe the characters as “prideful” or even “geniuses”; and that might be the biggest issue the show has.
Kaguya-sama begins in a very direct way; the whole idea of the show, everything about Miyuki and Kaguya, and their relationship is thrown at us through a narrator. There is no build up of their relationship, we are
                  told they are in love and we are immediately expected to care. As a result, I found it difficult to ever form a sort of solid connection with the characters, to ‘root’ for their romance, to think their ridiculous antics were always funny. Miyuki and Kaguya have little chemistry. It feels like I am missing something. With more care given to the characters, this show really could have been something special.
I can imagine this could have been salvaged, if the characters proved themselves so charismatic and fun that they would eventually become completely endearing. But the characters never really had a consistent personality. Because let's be honest, Miyuki and Kaguya are not always ‘prideful’. The are constantly shown as vulnerable, embarrassed, and shy. Highlighting those parts about them were easily the worst bits of the show. When they were smart, cunning, devious, it lead to the best and most hilarious moments. The author probably did this to make them more relatable and cute, but I ultimately think it negatively impacted the show. Some of the situations Miyuki and Kaguya go through are so trivial and childish that only sheer ridiculousness of their characters could have made it genuinely hilarious. When we know that the basis of their resistance to being open to one another is rooted more in shyness than pride, it makes the situations come off as more silly than potentially hilarious. It should have gone all in on making them scheming egomaniacs, for the sake of the humour.  
Sometimes the show did have moments where the characters acted the way I hoped they would—and it was funny. Various moments of the show proves itself as creative, enjoyable, and worthy. Chika and Ishigami served as good side characters, although it may have been a little too obvious that sometimes they were just there to steer the direction of the joke. The art style was bold and outwards. Over time the show starts to get a bit more ‘normal’ looking, but I do appreciate shows taking a step outwards to make it more memorable. 
Many times I was left feeling like some potential was being wasted. The show does stick to a formulaic way of having a ‘winner/loser’ in every bit, which didn’t always work. Sometimes it seems like the direction of the joke was radically shifted for no other reason than to just create a winner or a loser. I never found the narrator useful, and at worst he was just annoying. The show should have been more free, less confined to one particular style. Often it came off as settling.
The most disappointing thing about the show is how good it could have been.",6
"
                Considering the circumstances that have lead us to these conditions, I conclude the state we're currently facing is refreshingly cuddly in a soothing manner. 
I.e. How cute.
I don't really like A-1, but this time they are doing pretty darn impressive job. Even the character design which A-1 fucks up approximately 100% of the time is quality here. Unbelievable. Sure the stares and GAZES could deliver more, and the how cute moments can only be so cute, but otherwise this is a ridiculously high quality adaptation which success was unpredictable. 
The first and last thing that stands out here is the directing. Those who have seen
                  basically any anime at all will immediately recognize that this style is close to SHAFT's Shinbou Akiyuki, who is known as the nro. 1 anime director in the world pretty much. The director of Kaguya seems to be his old underling/coworker and, needless to say, he has learnt a great deal from the master himself. However -- unlike Tomohiro, who is the underling of the other big anime director (2nd biggest if you will), Ikuhara Kunihiko -- Kaguya's directing is much closer to its director's very own innovation, and to say that this is just a copy-paste would be a blind insult. This man has vision and style and doesn't seem to be afraid of anything. This is creativity and detail at its finest. It's rare to see modern anime even try and even more so: to success at anything new, but what our director, Shinichi Omata is doing here is nothing less than impressive. It's damn fresh to be accurate. Fully approved. 
Now that this nerd stuff out of the way, the content:
'Love is War' is a rom-com series aimed for mature audience. It centers around 2 main leads and few other leads who are kinda as important as the other two but also practically in the side roles. Our main 'couple' are Shirogane and Kaguya who have made the concept of 'love' their battlefield. In this battle they are quite literally trying to outwit each others with the power of psychology, logic and pure rhetoric. Why do this, then? Because they both share this fundamental idea that love is weakness of the mind and confessing it an act so against ones pride that doing so makes them.. losers. So, what they are doing instead is try and make the other one confess first. Hence the battlefield. 
The series heavily relies on both: interactions between characters and silent monologue that plays inside the heads of our different POV's. The catch being how different the characters are inside their own head and how they appear to others in real life. They have lots of personality and can show different sides of it. Perhaps my favorite part of all of it are the ""war planning"" and also how overly dramatic Kaguya often is. To say few words about the other cast members, Fujiwara is criminally cute and the rest are pretty much weirdos. 
There is one entity in the series that is highly important to the overall execution and that's the narrator. He appears to add lots of missing links and initial reasoning for the characters' thoughts, actions, and real purpose among other things. It balances out the comedy and ""plot side"" of the series as well as simply makes the overall narrative work/more solid.
As of currently, I'm extremely happy with this show. There are no major issues, only few small things that are questionable but also necessary to make the series' core idea hold water. As far as rom-coms go, this is already among the better things anime has to offer. Also +1 for Fujwara's dance scene which animation budget is higher than the entire season of Date A Live III's cashmoney.",9
"
                Almost every time someone talks to me about a romantic comedy, they'd would mention how well the romance is delivered. Then along came this show called Kaguya-sama: Love is War that goes beyond than just being a romantic comedy. In a landscape dominated by recent isekai shows, there’s a need for fresh air. Kaguya-sama managed be just that. 
Aka Akasaka is somewhat of a new author in the manga world. Prior to this series, their only work I was familiar with is Sayonara Piano Sonata. When Kaguya-sama began serializing, I knew there was something special about this series with the way it introduced its story
                  and characters. Do note that the anime adapts chapters not in a chronological order but takes them to make the overall tone of the show flow better. Every episode contains at least 3 segments from certain chapters. There’s also some that are structured with continued storytelling but nothing too complex. With that being said, I think it’s important to realize what this show really is.
First off, I would say that while this anime contains rom-com tropes, there’s also an insightful amount of dialogues that breaks from its traditional norms. Some will easily notice the mind games and dialogue wars between our two main protagonists – vice president Kaguya Shinomiya and President Miyuki Shirogane. Both are part of the prestigious school in Japan known as Shuchi’in Academy. While the two obviously develop feelings for each other, the show pits them into endless series of love battles. Their pride is on the line and neither are willing to confess their love. The English title also translates to “Kaguya Wants to be Confessed” so fresh anime viewers may wonder who will really be the one confessing in the end. That’s where the juicy part of the show comes in. You see, every episode contains segments about romance along with the constant mental battles between our two protagonists. From the very first episode, we see how much both characters value their pride. Their status at school are role models that everyone looks up to for their intelligence, looks, and position. In other words, Kaguya and Shirogane stands at the top of the mountain at Shuchi’in Academy and their only opponents are each other. Or is it? Because the more I watched this show, the more I realized the length both characters go to try to get the others to confess. This results in hilarious segments that drives the main plot. While both characters lack experience with love, they have many talent in other fields such as academics. In essence, the show manages to produce an immense amount of humor with the love war concept. 
Taking a look at each character on an individual level, Kaguya and Shirogane are actually quite normal despite being larger than life characters. However, the show portrays Kaguya as a girl who is obsessed with Shirogane. The extent of her mind games sometimes goes to extreme lengths such as trying to prevent Shirogane from leaving school, planting movie tickets, or even as something silly as fighting over a piece of cake. The result of these scenarios often end up with consequences or misunderstanding. This is where the show’s absurdity and humor comes in. Because of how hard both characters try to defend their own pride, they create a fake persona of themselves to each other. Nonetheless, it seems at times, Kaguya does have genuine feelings for Shirogane such as when she gets jealous of him interacting with Chika.
Ah yes, Chika Fujiwara. If there’s anyone in this show that could set off more reactions, it’s her. She’s like the catalyst for Kaguya’s mood swings in particular when interacting with Shirogane. Jealousy is easily shown on Kaguya’s face in early episodes and that’s thanks to her personality. In general, Chika is known to be disruptive to the school council. Whether she’s conscious about it or not, she often sets off absurd moments in the show because of her unpredictability. However, I think Chika’s presence in the show should be appreciated for exactly what she is. In fact, I categorize Chika as somewhat of anti-thesis of the main characters. She isn’t afraid to speak her mind and is very open about being herself. This is very different compared to Ai Hayasaka, Kaguya’s valet. Hayasaka takes on several personalities that can be hard to distinguish the real her. While being a supporting character, I find her role in the show important for being supportive of Kaguya. 
As with many rom-coms, it needs to have male characters that aren’t just alpha males like Shirogane. This is where Yu Ishigami comes in. Having an inferiority complex, he doesn’t have nearly as much as pride in himself as Shirogane. Unlike him, Ishigami isn’t a real genius but he tries hard in things that interests him. The more I watched his character interactions, the more I realized how real he is compared to the others. He can be rather relatable for his social status and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the anime needed someone like him too. That being said, outside of these characters, there’s only a small handful that gets spotlights such as Shirogane’s sister. There are occasional side characters that reinforces the themes of love in the show but these often don’t greatly influence the show’s plot. With everything being said, I think watching Kaguya-sama takes an open mind to accept what this show offers while also enjoying what you may not often find in rom-coms.
One of the interesting things I noticed is the production staff involved in the show. It consists of ex-Shaft members such as Shinchi Omata and Kei Haneoka. Director Shinichi Omata manages to capture a unique theatric feeling with his clever approach. For those who are familiar with Shaft, it can at times feel similar in style with his craft. Many scenes in the show has a dynamic transition that is impactful ranging from a character expression to the clever timing of the dialogues. Indeed, a show like this needs careful timing to deliver its dialogues. Even a narrator is here to speak for its plot. The animation quality is also polished with stellar effort and manages to capture the magic of the manga. We’re so lucky to have this adaptation with a golden treatment to be honest. Oh and who can forget the theme songs for the show? The opening contains a spy espionage-theme that matches this show in perfect union. It also contains choreography that shows the mind game themes without holding back. Simply put, it’s mesmerizing. Similarly, the ED theme songs are decorated with colorful aesthetics. There’s even one particular episode that had Chika perform her own ED theme because that’s just how damn good this show is.
I love the manga and the anime gave me a similar sensation. Sure, not all the chapters were adapted but that’s not the point at all. It managed to be rise above mediocrity of rom-coms by appealing to a variety of story gimmicks. The characters manages to deliver their lines like a theatric play filled with charisma and talent. While the story can feel repetitive at times, it’s thanks to the heartfilled humor that will always get you engaged. Kaguya-sama sets a gold standard for a romantic comedy that’s so much more than just confessing love.",9
"
                A masterpiece that evokes every emotion I want to feel from a Romantic comedy.
President Miyuki and Vice President Kaguya are in love with each other, but both view themselves as the ultimate object of desire, and thus see no reason to confess, in fact when you are as perfect as they are shouldn’t it be the duty of other people to aspire towards you? However, this is quickly revealed to be a front used by two egotistical Teenagers who can’t quite work up the courage to ask out their crush. What follows from this is a sequence of over thought-out plans in order to force
                  the other to confess. The comedy in the series comes from its hyper-dramatization of the utterly mundane. Asking someone to the movies is a complex web of intrigue, a game of 20 questions is a western shoot-out, and cat ears are banned by the Geneva convention. But no matter how well-laid the plans of Miyuki and Kaguya, destroying them is but child’s play to their secretary, Chika. This show would be amazing even if it was just comedy, but underneath the absurdity is a sincerely heart-warming story of teenagers learning to move past their flaws, insecurities, and other problems. We are given enough reminders that beneath all these mind games between the two leads there is genuine and sincere emotions for the other. So even though they never confess outright significant progress is still made in the characters’ lives.
A fast frenetic directing style gives the characters so much life even though all they are doing most of the time is thinking in a room. It’s not afraid to break away from reality constantly keep its visuals engaging, and the camera loves to spin, swing, and slide across the main set; Maneuvers made possible by some excellent use of CGI and compositing. Character expressions are exaggerated in creative ways, and the voice actors bring their A game to match the animation. Much like Jojo the color swims to match the mood of a scene, and combined with an eclectic collection of background music serves to set the tone perfectly for most scenes. Character movement is usually quite fluid. Aesthetically it knocks it out of the park. Not to say every frame is a masterpiece, as the cut corners are quickly discernible to a practiced eye, but the peaks far outnumber the troughs.
Aesthetically fantastic and narrative-ly ingenious: A show people must at least try.",10
"
                Disclaimer: This is a more critical view of Kaguya sama than something commented just on pure enjoyment overrall.
Kaguya sama is one of the newest and most popular comedy animes in the current times, be it due to simple jokes being shared or the dance in the ending that literally everyone decided to talk about, however, the overall quality of the anime itself should'nt be ignored because like everything else, it has it's flaws.
First of all, the anime is extremely episodic almost to the point of being predictable, it sticks to it's formula and never decides to change or take absolute advantage of being formulaic which
                  ends up in it being repetitive, still fun due to the visuals and somewhat great jokes every now and then but, critically speaking it's far from being as perfect as many reviews i've seen here make it out to be.
Also, the direction is overall pretty weak, it's an extremely visual style that reminds a bit of what studio shaft's directors tend to do but the way the director applied those tecniques makes it more something visually interesting that good unlike the huge majoritiy of the works by shaft.
And Lastly, the characters themselves are pretty ""ok-ish"", they sure are fun to watch but they lack some depth to them, even if you argumente that it's unnecessary for a comedy series to have a bit of complexity, Kaguya sama tries to actually be a romance at times to try going further into developing the relationship between the main cast so, if it's attempted by the author, even if weakly, automatically makes the argument invalid and compromises a bit more the anime.
Well, concluding it all, Kaguya sama is a weak anime and far from being the best of the current season, however, it's a fun ride, not a perfect one and even less one that deserves a nines and tens but one that should be taken a look if you want just a pretty nice comedy.",6

                I must be to old to like this anime.
There is no story, it`s all about 2 young students who are afraid to show their real feelings.
And then it`s only short stories, 3 or 4 in 1 episode.
It`s really boring, Chika is somewhat amusing although not really.
Maybe if the characters would evolve, but they don`t.
The main characters are showing bold and all knowing, but they are really as insecure as a little schoolgirl
Maybe i have seen to many of this genre, but it just doesn`t interest me at all.Watch this if you like to see insecure students bumbling around, otherwise don`t waste your time on this
perhaps the manga is beter, but i don`t like reading from right to left so i`ll never know",4
"
                This is not good.
The whole show got popular and keeps getting popular thanks to a meme of a dancing lady. A lot of people consider it the best comedy show they have seen, and a lot of people dislike the fact this is called a comedy anime.
I'm on par with the last example, this whole show is extremely repetitive and predictable, you can pretty much predict what's gonna happen in the next 10 minutes, without the help of any spoilers, most of the jokes and comedic parts are hardly funny or as you would like to call it ""sarcastic"". It was a premise with the
                  name of something so intriguing as ""Psychological Comedy"" but ended up being your next Sword Art, it is almost childish to call this Psychological just because of camera angles, and because some characters ""threat"" each other with words when both of them don't even know the meaning of love.
The whole direction of the series keeps going down with every episode and skit looking the same as before and the same as every other A-1 Pictures anime. Keeping the formula of generic episodic series.
The characters are (as mentioned) like any other characters the studio has produced, even if they are not made by the same person, their personalities, traits and such are always the same, lacking depth and complexity in their development. 
The show itself started slow, and with forced comedy that barely made me smile, it is indeed a weak anime when it comes to this season. Would i recommend this? No. Would you enjoy it? Probably. Did I enjoy it? No.

                This is one of those special anime that perfectly represents why I’ve been sticking with anime for so long. Love is War exudes brilliance with every fiber of its being. It has so much going for it, and offers something that practically everyone can enjoy. In simpler terms, it’s just so damn good bruh! What, don’t believe me? pfft, how cute. Let me lecture you on why this anime is pure excellence. 
Psychological battles of wits have always excited me. It’s quite exhilarating to witness two characters going head to head against each other not physically, but mentally.  Anime RomComs with interesting and dynamic
                  characters can always be a joy to watch as well, especially when they take an unconventional approach to the genre. Love is War is a crazy mix of both of these genres, almost like it’s the illegitimate love child of Death Note and Toradora. And let me tell you, this anime is super legit. 
It doesn’t take a love detective to figure out that overachieving student council protagonists Kaguya and Shirogane have a thing for each other. Yet they’re both so hilariously egotistical and out of touch with reality that they constantly attempt to coerce the other into making the first move, since in their minds, doing so would be a major sign of weakness. For the person who confesses first…*dramatic pause*…loses. Funnily enough, I believe that the person who takes the first step in starting a relationship is actually the stronger one, but that’s not how these two see it. Their relationship is portrayed brilliantly in the anime, and the amount of entertaining scenarios that these two find themselves in during each episode is just mind boggling. Plus the three major side characters, Chika, Ishigami, and Hayasaka, are all hilarious, and they simply further add to the greatness of the show. 
Love is War is one of those rare anime where it actually gets better and better in practically every regard after each passing episode. Seriously though, all concerns and doubts that I had about this show after watching the first episode were completely obliterated from existence as it went on. And then the anime decided to straight up surpass my expectations for it, it’s just that awesome. Of course, while many of the show’s successes are noticeably apparent, others require you to look a little deeper into the anime to discover. 
Something that I didn’t realize until the later portion of the anime was just how much Kaguya develops as a character. I was so focused on the comedy that I almost missed it, though her growth is pretty subtle. I discovered that Kaguya becomes significantly more expressive then she was in the earlier episodes, and seems to have really come out of her shell.  What I believe started as a mere fleeting interest in getting the highest ranked student at her academy to fall for her blossomed into a truly heartfelt love for the student council president. I won’t get into Kaguya’s backstory, but let’s just say that feelings and love are quite foreign to her. Yet through her many interactions with Shirogane, she starts to understand how to feel, and this causes her to both show and perceive real emotion. Yes, she was always a fun character from beginning to end. Yet while the initial battles Kaguya waged against Shirogane primarily focused on her amusing ability to plan her strategies incredibly far in advance, her only desire was to win and make Shirogane submit to her. However, with her later battles, they just felt more genuine, like she was legitimately trying to make Shirogane confess to her because she actually loves the guy and is just too awkward and nervous to make the first move herself. The fantastic visuals help to further emphasize this, as we constantly see her flailing about in embarrassment and being all blushy blushly when in the presence of Shirogane as she starts to spend a lot more time with him. Maybe I’m reading too much into this, but damn it, the author is a certified genius for writing Kaguya’s character in such a compelling way.
It’s development like this that really gets me to appreciate both the character and their respective show. Yet although Kaguya is the protagonist, what probably ended up as the most popular thing about this anime was Chika. More specifically, her dance. 
The Chika dance sequence alone is enough to give this anime high marks in both the visual and sound departments. Her dance literally has the power to save anime AND cure crippling depression at the same time, it’s just that good. Now I’m not well versed in the mechanics of animation, but I do know that the style used to animate Chika’s dance is quite expensive, so major respect to the animators for putting so much effort into constructing such a special dance. A-1 probably had to steal the budgets from some of the other winter seasonals to pull this off, but it was totally worth it. Now I don’t want to overshadow the rest of the animation in Love is War by just talking about Chika’s dance, because the entire show is aesthetically charming and distinctive. 
Stylistically speaking, I noticed that this anime utilizes tons of unique visual techniques that really bring things to life and add even more layers to the anime. While the setting of the show predominately takes place in the same old student council room, every single scene is still unique and fresh thanks to the innovative visual effects used each episode. It’s kind of hard to explain it without actually showing the visuals, but if you watch the show, you’ll understand what I’m getting at. Though the greatest accomplishment in the animation department would have to be the character designs. Not only do they look great normally, but the characters are constantly animated in different styles that keep things fresh and further heighten the comedic value of the show. They’re drawn in such a variety of designs, from horror-esque to chibi-like. Each and every frame just seems to have been created with so much care. In an age where it feels like most animators just put the bare minimum into their shows, it’s refreshing to see an anime given so much attention to its visual quality and special effects. Props to A-1 Pictures.
Voice acting is superb. I initially wasn’t certain how well Kaguya’s seiyuu would work when I first saw Kaguya’s character design, but I soon realized just how perfect a fit she is. She just breathes so much life into Kaguya, who is already a superior character. The rest of the voice actors do a phenomenal job as well, and their expert line deliveries further heighten the effectiveness of jokes. Also, the weird little noises that the girls, particularly Chika, occasionally make are just great. Like, how cute can they get? The theme songs are nice and the soundtrack does its job well.
The cast of characters are truly the fuel that bring this anime to life. When the core cast is as small as it is in this anime, the likability of these individuals can really make or break the success of the show. For me, I ended up liking every single one of the characters. Like, a lot.
So Kaguya is best girl for me, and if you dare disagree…then that’s okay too! I’ve already talked about some of the more prominent aspects of her character, but I’m not going to pass up an opportunity to further praise her. First of all, she’s absolutely adorable. Especially during the bed scene in episode 9, where all I could think was how cute can this girl possibly be? I love her color palette because red and black are obviously the best colors. Her awkwardness combined with her intellectual brilliance is incredibly fitting. What truly makes her shine though is her relationship with Shirogane. The two of them just complement each other so well. Shirogane himself is a workaholic, and I wish that I had half of his work ethic. Just half, since any more would probably cause me to keel over from exhaustion. Seriously though, with the way he works, I don’t know how this man manages to stay on his feet! Like Kaguya, his social ineptitude is matched only by his intelligence, and the combination just works. 
Chika is the most entertaining supporting character I’ve seen in a long time. I was trying to think of one of her finer moments to use as an example of why she’s so amusing, but then I realized that they’re all good. Love detective Chika. Volleyball coach Chika. Cheating at card games Chika. Ramen connoisseur Chika. The list goes on. Chika’s ditsy nature and complete obliviousness to her surroundings are incredibly charming. She just brings a sort of energy to the show that increases my power levels tenfold whenever she’s on screen. Ishigami is the fourth and final member of the student council we’re introduced to, and he’s like the most relatable dude ever. He really is our guy. I can connect with a lot of his monologues on a spiritual level, and his introduction into the show was when it really started to become something great in my opinion. The final character that I’d like to give a shoutout to is Hayasaka. She is Kaguya’s attendant, and her dedication to helping Kaguya get together with Shirogane is admirable. She literally gets them in the same bed together at one point, so good on you Hayasaka. 
To sum everything up, Love is War works because it’s actually funny. Like with every comedy anime I watch, I was worried that the jokes would eventually go stale and the show would get boring as it progressed. I can tell you with absolute certainty that this isn’t the case with Love is War. Each episode actually seemed to get even funnier than the last, and this ended up being one of those rare anime that actually got me to laugh out loud. Yes, comedy is subjective. But there’s such a diverse agglomeration of jokes to be found here that it just feels like this anime has something for everyone. The entertainment derived from watching something is, for me, the most important aspect of a show, and Love is War completely nails it in this regard.
Overall, this is a quality anime that I would wholeheartedly recommend watching for the comedy alone, not to mention the plethora of other great things that this show brings to the table. Love is War is not the anime we deserved, but the one we needed. Like, desperately. Hopefully future comedies, and all genres for that matter, will follow Love is War’s excellent example. And hey, a season 2 wouldn’t hurt as well. Let’s get it done A-1, cause I simply need MOAR!",9

                “Wieners sliced to look like an octopus!  They really exist!  I want to try one…” — Kaguya Shinomiya
“Ohh, gawd.  Did I accidentally stumble upon Shokushu Goukan….(again)?!” — Krunchyman
Overt references to tentacle erotica aside, Kaguya-sama: Love is War is an anime about two people — Kaguya and Miyuki — who secretly love each other, but are unwilling to confess their affections in fear that the other person will gain the upper hand.  This, invariably, commences a series of events in which Kaguya and Miyuki attempt to psychologically outmaneuver one another, generating a conglomerate of awkward/comedic circumstances.  Whether or not these ventures
                  result in genuine laughter is a matter of comedic taste, but it won’t stop me from telling you my thoughts on the matter.
Love is War presents a situation that is all too common in preteen-to-teen years, that being: “I love you, but I’ll pretend otherwise.”  The school milieu, along with pent-up hormones, forces numerous young-adults to experience these contradictory feelings towards one another, resulting in numerous awkward/hilarious situations.  For Kaguya and Miyuki, these situations involve Death-Note-level internal monologues where they battle one another in a metaphorical game of cognitive love-chess.  It’s actually fairly entertaining (albeit in a foolish way — which is precisely the way I like it, uh huh huh).
The best moment of the series, thus far, was when Kaguya (a sixteen year-old girl, mind you) thought that her “first time” was a reference to kissing, instead of sexual intercourse.  Her naive innocence propelled her to claim, “I did it to my newborn nephew,” which resulted in horrified looks from Chika and Miyuki; I was laughing my balls off!
Love is War is not the type of series that will blow your socks off, yet its coquettish dynamic between Kaguya and Miyuki has a certain charm that is not easily consummated in the genre.  The jokes, themselves, are more miss than hit, but the ones that do hit are exceptionally hilarious.  The direction of the plot seems quite obvious (an eventual confession by either Kaguya or Miyuki, or both at the same time), but the journey towards their declaration of love is quite humorous, plus the ending dance by Chika is dope as f—k!",8

                “See, this show's what having a good director can do for your fuckin' show. You can make A-1 Pictures look like a competent studio. That's fucked up!” -DEEsidia from REVEL HOUSE, 2019 
Pride is cruel and ignorance is bliss, and when love is war, feelings are the casualties. Kaguya-sama is this concept taken to a hilarious extreme, with two teenage egotists trying to manipulate each other into confessing their feelings as every idea they ever had gets trampled on. This show thrives off its comedic timing, with tons of audiovisual flair, character chemistry, and wild ideas for our main leads to plan around and exploit.
                  With A-1 being listed as the studio behind this, I’m sure some alarms were triggered, but thanks to Rakugo director Shinichi Omata, everything listed prior is utilized spectacularly.
Shinichi Omata brings a ton of life to this anime with his stylistic flourishes. A lot of the time, backgrounds and camera movements are incredibly stylized, adding to scenes of characters overthinking things. Whenever a character starts freaking out or shouting in an over the top fashion, several grainy motion lines consume either the characters or the backgrounds. The ED themes have some creative visuals as well. These and more all add so much character to the visuals, which is a blessing since despite the fun character designs and facial expressions, the artwork dips a surprising amount early on, and the sparse CGI models can be pretty terrible. Thankfully, the visual inconsistencies and blemishes are so infrequent that the expressive visual flourishes and amazing shots more than make up for them.
On top of the great visual comedy is the actual character comedy, relying on bombastic personalities and their chemistry with one another, including the narrator of the show, who provides a healthy dose of both on his own whilst poking fun of our main leads. Shirogane’s an over-the-top serious character, constantly shouting despite always maintaining a sense of authority, combining the general style of Gendo Ikari from Eva with the ridiculously dorky yet serious nature of someone like Yamamoto from Tylor or Sora from NGNL. It makes things all the funnier when he’s undermined by love interest Kaguya Shinomiya, who constantly wants to retain her air of refinement and superiority despite being a sheltered, jealous dork who gets flustered at the drop of a hat. However, the character that steals the show for me is Chika Fujiwara, the busty wildcard cloudcuckoolander --think Mayuri from Steins;Gate but probably evil-- who’s constantly making Kaguya jealous and single-handedly dismantling everyone around her and whatever they try to do. This doesn’t include the times when Chika has to teach Shirogane how to do things, which brings her immense pain. A close contender for best character is Ishigami, who appears halfway into the show, and is as paranoid and ridiculous as he is sensitive and adorable. It takes half the show to introduce him, but some of the show’s most gut-busting moments come from him, especially when he reaches critical sass levels. Lastly, there’s our helpful deadpan character in Kaguya’s maid, Ai Hayasaka, who has particularly great chemistry with Kaguya as she attempts to help her earn Shirogane’s heart. Somehow, she has the most surprises up her sleeves. The random tertiary characters are all entertaining as well, thanks to the comedic and sometimes emotionally resonant writing of a well-balanced and vibrant main and supporting cast. Each skit tells us something new about these characters. Combine that with their chemistry and the sheer number of skits, it leaves these characters feeling incredibly rich, on top of being varied and colorful. You can honestly make a case for any of the 5 major characters being the best, which is a great sign.
Kei Haneoka’s music does a good job complimenting the show’s calculated absurdity. The OST often cycles between being as bombastic as the scenarios they support and being whimsical, meme tracks that play over sequences such as a comedic explanation of the game 20 Questions. The OP ""Love Dramatic feat. Rikka Ihara"" by Masayuki Suzuki is one of the standouts of the season, boasting a jazzy, almost James Bond-like feel with the sneaky and sometimes psychedelic visuals to match once the song reaches its chorus. It matches the personalities of the main duo quite well and how they treat these scenarios like mind games. Sadly, the EDs don’t live up outside of the visuals and the meme factor of Chika’s ED. That, however, is a small loss.
Kaguya-sama is one of the funniest and most well-directed shows I have seen in a long time. This outrageous premise certainly won’t appeal to everyone, especially to those who hate the concept of two main characters pussyfooting around confessing to each other. However, the wonderful cast, humor, and visual direction more than make up for any possible annoyance that otherwise may have caused me. Nearly every skit and episode build upon the last. If you want your fix of romcoms or shows starring manipulative egotists, this is almost certainly the anime for you. It’ll probably stay in my holy trinity of comedy anime for quite some time.

                I despise A-1 Pictures. They either make average shows out of good source material or make absolute trash. You can imagine my disappointment when I saw that a manga with a score of about 8.65 was given to A-1. And judging by that 10 in the top right corner, you can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was when I saw the first episode of this show.
Kaguya-sama is the funniest anime I have seen since Tanaka-kun, which says a lot since the latter is my favorite comedy anime. The sheer ridiculousness of the plot is hilarious. Death Note-level mind games are woven into a story about
                  two high schoolers who are pretty much too ashamed to ask each other out, and to top it all off, everything is over-dramatized.
The one good thing about A-1 is that they get insane budgets for their anime. Every technical aspect without exception is wonderful. Perfect art, great OSTs, great VAs, one of the best OPs I've ever heard, and that Chika dance ED from episode 3.
Overall, Kaguya-sama is pure genius. An ingenious and novel plot, great characters, and a massive budget are apparently enough to create a masterpiece. Kaguya-sama is hilarious, heart-warming, and original, which is everything most romcoms are not.",10

                2 geniuses trying to feel superiority by making the other confess first! This has got to be one of the best scenarios ever!
Art/Sound:
Let's get this straight, I don't love the studio that makes this anime and feel as though their animation is solid but not great, however, holy shit! The visuals in this anime are so impressive, it reminds me of something Shaft would produce which I love, most people are going to be pleasantly surprised at how great the animation and the art in general is! Sound wise, I have 0 complaints! Voice acting is spot on with a very underrated funky OP and
                  perfect ED for the anime. The sound gets an 8 and the art gets a 9!
Plot/Characters:
The show is episodic and within each episode, it's broken down into even smaller parts which makes for a non-stop funny entertaining anime that's consistently great throughout! My main concern with the plot is that it seems to start to get repetitive after a while but honestly I don't give a fuck due to how great EVERY episode is! Fucking hell... the best cast of characters this season easily! The main characters have amazing chemistry and juxtapose perfectly with the airhead secretary! This dynamic between the characters is perfect and sets up for a perfect balance of tense and hilarious sequences! The plot gets an 8 and the characters get a 10
Overall: 
I don't have any major faults to talk about this anime! It's been a non-stop exciting, hilarious show fuelled by a fantastic cast and I hope that it's repetitiveness doesn't make it stale after it's completion! I'm honestly blown away at how there isn't a single episode where I don't feel as though the 25 mins we're actually 5 mins! Each episode is so entertaining that I lose track of time; because of this it gets an enjoyment rating of 10 and an overall rating of 9!",9
"
                I did not like the series, most people say that this series is innovative ... but I say, in what innovates? same composition of characters in any romantic novel (the 2 tsundere protagonists who like each other, but none dares to take a step to the point that it becomes annoying, secondary characters whose only function is to look silly on screens to make people laugh no deeper development).
In my opinion until the anime of ueno-san is better than this since at least does not have the typical composition among its characters.
In short, I do not see that people see this anime when there are
                  much better romantic comedies.
Both psychological game to make the other do something that the 2 want to do and has me sick.",1

                A random day back in December 2015 had me giving a chance to at that point very recent manga called Kaguya-sama after the cover grabbed my attention, not too many chapters after I already fell in love with it and it eventually became my favorite work ever and the one that I was waiting like crazy for an adaptation to happen, and when that time came… oh god, they couldn't have delivered harder!
The main duo of this story are Kaguya and Miyuki, the two students at the top of a highly renowned academy and the two most lovable tsunderes out there, consistently trying to outplay
                  the other into confessing their love to hilarious results. These two characters come from very different perspectives (she is from a very rich and influential family with questionable raising standards and has been sheltered from the outside in the process, while he has to work part-time together with all the stuff he does to help his family, this man needs to sleep) and this is so, so nicely used for both comedic elements and also for the more dramatic parts that this work has, that give fantastic character development and make us understand and love them even more than before.
Together with those two, the student council also has two more (and equally awesome) members that bring extra dynamics to the interactions and comedy. Chika is a completely chaotic element to the tactics of the main duo, with her personality completely clashing with all the strategies they might have prepared. Lastly, we have ourguy Ishigami, the man, the legend, this man is so lovable and the perfect mix of “dude, wtf” and “stop being relatable”, protect at all costs.
A-1 Pictures is a studio that gets a lot of hate that I can't agree with at all, the way they work with different staffs leads to very different results, but any studio is pretty hit or miss anyways, and when this one goes all in very few deliver as hard, so I was very optimistic towards them getting this anime, and yet they surpassed my expectations, hard. The directing of the series is just fantastic, with so many great shots, camera movements, perfectly executed timing on the character reactions to add to the comedy, lots of extra details… just wow. 
Another thing I want to praise is the voice actors, who did such an outstanding work in the way that makes you think “man, they sure had fun recording this!” I have nothing but good things to say about them, and I especially want to mention Yutaka Aoyama, the narrator of the series (such a key element of Kaguya and he did it flawlessly, so many laughs!) and Aoi Koga, who I already had the fortune to hear about thanks to her secondary role in the also fantastic Aikatsu Stars, which made me see before this anime started that she was the perfect fit for Kaguya's character, who gives a hard work with her switches between absurdly adorable and quite terrifying due to her way to be and that she did so well.
I'm so happy that this anime got the popularity it deserved (thanks Chika dance for helping with that) and I hope that this is just the first from a lot of seasons that this work needs so badly, I 100% recommend you to give this anime a chance if you haven't yet, you won't regret it!",10

                Kaguya-sama: Love is War 
As much as this show can be as stereotypical an anime can be, it wasn't a surprise to see the show using the same tropes used in the past, in these days finding out a new way to make a love comedy anime interesting is quite hard. So rather than focusing on changing the tropes, other aspects of the anime can be changed to make it alluring towards the viewer, and that's what this anime did. 
Rather than focusing on the plot of the story, since hardly there is really no plot, it's focused more on the antics,  plotting of
                  the characters, to make the other one confess their love. The synergy between these characters is what separates this show towards all other love romantic comedies out there, all the characters are in a way, in correlation to, connected to each other to make out the perfect chemistry. The side characters are there to break the ice between the two tunnel visioned main characters whilst adding a sense of unpredictability between what can happen. 
Their problems isn't so special as much as they are quite pointless, stupid and illogical, mostly focusing a lot on the little things that doesn't necessarily move them forward to a better relationship, in this, they conduct such activities into a day to day basis, which leads them into questionable situations they put themselves through, with this style, it wasn't as so much serious but rather more of a casual, funny, watch. Whilst it is casual and funny, the anime still manages to be able to transfer into a comedic situation into a serious situation in a way that looked natural, therefore opened up a new path for more in-depth development towards the characters and the problem that they face. 
The voice actors have played a big role in bringing out the character's sense of personality, as well as the narrator playing a part in bringing out the show's tone and mood. The character's are easily likable and cute, with their set of unique personalities that defines them respectively and sets them apart. The soundtrack is nice as well. 
In conclusion Kaguya-sama: Love is War is a defining example of what love comedy shows should strive to be and what it can be. With it's allure of likable, funny, unique characters, and a little twist in the genre, it has proved itself to be a must-watch for everyone to at least try, and decide for yourself it's sense of worth. (How cute).",9

                ""If I cover my ears, then my hands aren't free to protect my belly button!""
- Shoki no Chika
Reminder: this review does not include any element of comparison with the manga and contains just a little bit spoiler (not too much). Of course, I have read the manga and it is very good, but I'm not the kind of person who would want to compare an anime to its original source (it's kinda pointless to compare 3 hours of Grisaia to the 50 hours of its visual novel, for the sake of example); (and English is not my native tongue).
Because tradition dictates it, here is a
                  short introduction to the anime: read the synopsis! Okay… You have a cool and smart but poor blond president, a very candid oujo-sama (how cute!), a perverse… I mean cute secretary and an otaku gamer treasurer.
And if you want to distinguish yourself from the plebe: if you are asked to choose between the vice-president and the secretary, say that you prefer the girl with white hair and blue eyes! She is the real hidden heroine of this anime! (Or if you are not into imou… then just say that the best girl is the maid.)
So, let's get to the heart of the matter: what makes Kaguya-sama so good? Of course, it's a comic anime, so if the number of your laugh while watching Kaguya-sama is close to zero, then you'll certainly find it bad. As for me, even before the anime finishes airing, I have already rewatched it at least three or four times, and I’m still dying of laughing every minute, and sometimes every twenty seconds.
Yes, I am an extreme case of someone who loves this anime.
So, you have your answer. Kaguya-sama is so good because it makes you burst out laughing. Do I need to bother myself more than that? The humor of this anime is simple, made up of sitcomics, facial exaggerations and overreactions (Chika!), misunderstandings, puns, childish jokes (chin chin!)... All of it made me laugh.
Furthermore, there is also a romance that is developed, which can both make us laugh and simply make us appreciate what it has to offer. The interactions, dialogues, in addition of making one laugh, are very fluid, dynamic and well juxtaposed, which are not useless chatter as in other comedy animes.
All this makes up the remarkable staging of the characters, their interaction and their daily life (in a way). You can enjoy Kaguya-sama without necessarily laughing at each of its gags, because the anime also offers moments of slice of life, school life and it most often brings us closer to the characters.
Among those who did not like it, I bet some will justify the ""why they did not like it"" with arguments such as: ""the jokes were repetitive"", ""oh no, it’s another cliché romcom"", instead of saying that this is just not their type of humor. Of course, sometimes a repetition of a scheme or the same element can destroy the enjoyment. However, this is not systematic, and Kaguya-sama is proof of that: from the first to the last episode, there was not a single one in which I did not burst out laughing. Regarding the ""cliché"" matter, it would be selfish if you were to impose your point of view, because by ""cliché"" it actually depends on your anime experience and culture, and sometimes one could not be bothered by the cliché or even enjoy it! (Gotoubun, Monogatari Series…)
So, to put it simply, it's my anime of the season, and I'm glad I can say it. I loved this anime so much that I would say it's the best comedy anime I've ever seen in my life (yes, I’m an extreme case…), and I hope that it would encourage you to go to read the manga! (some chapters have not been adapted)
To conclude with a personal point, I loved the opening and endings of this anime (Chikatto Chika Chikattsu of course), the charadesign is magnificent (especially the girls' eyes) and the seiyuu are always at the top of their performance!
That's it, thank you for reading and feel free to give me a feedback.",10
"
                ""O kawaii koto~""
Imagine if Death Note was a romcom. Imagine that Light and L were not trying to outwit each other with the world itself at stake, but rather just that they actually liked each other romantically but were too shy and awkward to just it outright. Do you think that sounds ridiculous? Maybe, but that's more or less the idea behind Kaguya-sama. Well, except it's not yaoi of course.
If you ever need a benchmark for how to do a romcom really damn good, then look no further than this. There really aren't many series within the genre out there that can manage to not
                  just be cute and hilarious, but actually quite intelligent as well, but Kaguya-sama does it all. The anime follows the daily lives of Shirogane Miyuki and Shinomiya Kaguya, the top two students at Shuchiin Academy, and also president and vice president respectively of its student council. They're both geniuses and they're also both hopelessly in love with each other, however they're also... two tsunderes incapable of ever taking the first step themselves. In fact, due to how proud they are, they think confessing to someone is a sign of weakness as it implies that the one being confessed to is more valuable and desirable than the person doing the confessing, and this fact combined with their shyness have them both 100% determined to never make the first move. Instead, they both try to do everything they can to mind game the other into confessing to them first, no matter how complex the scheme required to accomplish that may be. As a result, you have a perfect setup for complete and utter hilarity.
It's a brilliant concept in general and it's executed really well, mainly thanks to how loveable the characters are and how the chemistry between them works. The show is definitely not just about Shirogane and Kaguya: the other members of the student council are just as important to the anime's enjoyment. The cheerful and free-spirited secretary Chika is the consistent X-factor of the series who always ends up somehow interfering with the main duo's carefully thought-out plans and flip everything on its head, whereas the introverted and somewhat paranoid treasurer Ishigami is probably the most normal and relatable character in the show, although I wouldn't go as far as to call him the voice of reason either. In any case, the point is that they're all very different from each other and they work perfectly together as a group as they all operate in harmony to emphasize each other's gags. Kaguya-sama is a comedy first and foremost, operating in a “one sketch per chapter"" basis in the manga, and in the anime they're essentially doing three of those scenes per episode. Now that is not to say that it does not have romance too, but it is a very slow burn on that front, and at the very least in the span of what the anime covers, it is not really the primary focus.
Kaguya-sama is a very well-directed comedy show that makes great use out of a brilliant original concept, and really anyone with a decent sense of humour should be obligated to check it out. Great narrative, surprisingly good production value by A-1 standards, and just a very charming series in general.
PS: Chika's dance as the ED of episode three is probably the greatest thing you'll ever see.",9

                Little to nothing is good about this show.
KSLIW is egregiously overrated. It’s nothing but a massive gimmick that I’m truly ashamed to see score so highly on MAL. It’s an interesting enough premise that suffers from sudden, rapid-fire tone shifts that lack any weight for how often they happen, with a hammy overdose of stupid cheap drama that functions so far outside any realm of rationality it’s no longer orbiting anything in this galaxy.
The viewer gets to know the narrator on a much deeper level than the characters. Anything longer than 30 seconds of exposition and every anituber gripes and moans about how insulting it
                  is to the viewer, but let a narrator exposition dump almost nonstop throughout the whole show and I guess that somehow warrants a score of 8.43 (S1) 8.84 (S2) (somehow putting it above actual masterpieces like Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass and Princess Mononoke to name a few and just four placements down from Spirited Away). 
“Okami-san and Her Seven Companions” narrator was excessively in your face but had some charm since she knew she was being obnoxious & made sense about half the time… which rightfully deflated an otherwise notably fun show with a fair amount of potential. KSLIW took that same aggravating component that did the most to sabotage Okami-san and made a whole show about it. By speaking time alone, the narrator has a much more legitimate claim to being the actual main character than any other character.
The two main characters are only ever seen in one light. They both suffer from a bougie obsession with prestige that should be entirely intolerable to any regular person with a distaste for aristocracy. The pink haired girl is nothing but a fluffy moe nuisance trope that squeeks her way on screen to add nothing of substance.
KSLIW offers mediocre art & music with a mediocre highschool that stylistically speaks to some of the obnoxious fetishization of Western aristocracy seen elsewhere in anime that I won’t recommend.
Exposition dumping and general hammy execution aside, a major point that I want to make is that the humor this show flexes so hard on, only matters if you care about their prestige, which no average anti-aristocratic person should. 
Their romance only matters if they offer something unique, which it doesn’t due to the tropiness of their personalities and only seeing them under one light in these micro circumstances so small a flea would probably brush it off as nothing but crumbs of a melodrama. 
The funniest part of this show is how overrated it is. It’s migraine inducing mediocrity that I’m quite frankly insulted by.

"
                In Spring season, i was looking forward to two anime in particular Promised neverland and kaguya sama love is war.
Kaguya sama love is was turned out to be the biggest disappointment of the year for me, i knew about the manga for quite a long time and had high expectations because of the rave reviews it received. 
So i kept myself back from reading manga because of anime.
But the anime turns out to be mediocre at best. there is literally nothing apart from forced drama that makes it any different from the shows in its recommendation tab.
Story : 4 - At first the plot seemed
                  appealing to me. But the way the story was executed is just a atrocious. Most episodes can be summed up as, One of the main character encounters a problem and makes a huge deal,  involving that scenario our two childish main characters fight to get the other confess. rinse and repeat over the span of 12 episodes and we get this stagnated show. 
Comedy in the show is also poorly done. What we get for the tag of psychological is forced drama which accounts to nothing. You can literally kick the word plot-development out of the window.
Characters : 4 - There isn't any endearing character in this series. We have our main cast shirogane whose only role is to overthink and complicate matters. Kaguya is our go to tsundere whose only salient feature is to say ""O Kawaii Koto"" after long nonsensical rhetoric. Chika is our ubiquitous big boob , cute voice galore character,  whose role in the anime was to ruin the little shenanigans our main cast were playing with each other. Basically a redundant character.
Plot twist: When i thought we only had three characters this anime pulled the  one and only plot twist of the show and introduced this gloomy otaku whose name i forgot as soon as i saw his character. This otaku guy was as tedious as our plot. you guys can just ignore this wanker he is only put in the show to fill some useless space.
Art : 7 : This is probably the only redeeming feature of the show, the art was pretty crisp some of the dance sequences of chika were animated amazingly well. Use of bright, contrasting colors gave this worth a try , Overall, art department turned out to be the saving grace of this show.
Sound : 6 - This department of the show was good, Opening song was mellifluous. Ending song was also Ok and didn't leave much of an impression on me. As for Voice acting, voice actors did pretty good job to give life to these lifeless, dull characters. So big prop to the voice actors.
Enjoyment : 3 - All in all the only thing this show thrived on was, Chika performing her kpop moves and showing her love and support for the girl bands. As for some comparing it to the likes of Death Note, they are doing nothing but committing sacrilegious act  Neither the characters have the charisma or ingenuity of Light and L nor the story is good enough to warrant this show to be said in the same breath as death note.
Overall : 4 - If you're into romcom maybe you should give it a try. As far people looking for something seinen or psychological. I would encourage to steer as far away from this show as possible and watch some other good shows or spend your time in doing something productive.
Thanks for your kind time.",4
"
                The Art style and animation itself is good, the idea is at least kind of different, but the rest is plain boring and cringe.
The main draw of the series seem to be humor, and if you find very slow and predictable gags that one can see coming from a mile away while some dude explains it to you in a narration then fine but if you are looking for anything of substance I would advise further exploration.
every person in the show is a archetype which is expected from a romance of course, and of course there is the cringe ""oh my god are they dating""
                  and everybody adoring the main couple because they are the elite or something, if you have no contact with human beings this may not bother you but anyone who has real interactions I believe would be bothered by this.
The romance is not that bad, as each one tries to make the other admit their feelings, instead of going in someone's head and seeing ""i love him but what if he doesn't like me"" these characters try to manipulate each other into showing affection which is a nice change, but then again different does not mean well done.
The voice acting is pretty good, no real problems so far
The visuals, some of the in mind visuals are absolutely great and the usual quality is not low either
Watch this only if you're really bored or really like a certain character design so much that you want to see them over and over again",5

                *No Spoiler Concise Review*
TL;DR: If a Tsundere and a Tsundere liked each other, would they ever find out? 
[Story: 6/10 , Characters: 9/10, Art: 8/10, Sound: 7/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]
Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen aka Love is War, is your simple romcom school anime about a boy and a girl, in love with one another, facing the crippling pressure of confession. Sounds very boring and repetitive, right? WRONG. This show took this super repetitive simple concept and just elevated it to the next level where they accentuate the idea of confession to the level of cold war. Sounds dark? More like sounds dank. Seriously,
                  if viewers became tired of watching the boring romcom genres of yesteryears, then this show will fill new gaps you never realized you even had. Love is War is basically a cold war fought between two genius tsundere school council lovers who are trying to edge the other person to confess to them, just so they can look at them with their smug face while internally blushing to death for finally their partner acknowledging their existence. Sure, the romance is minimal and comedy is maximum, but the refreshing change of pace & studio A-1 pictures knowing how to give smug shots life, actually makes the show worthwhile to watch. 
The anime barely has plot but what it has are memorable characters that gives the plot itself depth of various multitude. Essentially the anime is presented in mini shorts where the two main tsunderes, Shinomiya and Shirogame, try to make the other confess. At the end of each short, we are presented with scores of that week to see who is ahead. Through the battle of wits we are able to learn more about the characters past, present and future endeavours. Truthfully, if the anime wasn't formatted as such, then pace wise, it would have one of the slowest romantic stories ever. Where it lacks in story, it excels in dialogues. Albeit the massive repetitions of ""ara ara"" & ""ma ma"", the witty dialogues between the characters keeps the show feeling fast paced and enjoyable for viewers.
Beside the slow yet witty plot, the highlight of this show are the characters. The main three characters are Shirogame, the poor hardworking academic genius school president virgin to dating, Shinomiya, the lazy kind-hearted competitive egotistic maniac school vice-president also virgin to dating and lastly Fujiwara, the happy go lucky peaceful athletic emotional memer secretary with big oppais to maintain balance in the council. If we revisit the cold war analogy, Shirogame would be USA, Shinomiya would be USSR and Fujiwara would be Canada just maintaining peace & balance for everyone. Of the three, Fujiwara, steals the show with her outlandish caricature tantrums but as a whole the characters is what makes the show. Not to mention, the amazing seiyuus voicing these wonderful characters, Makoto Furukawa, Aoi Koga and Konomi Kohara respectively gives such life to these characters by accentuating their antics makes it really enjoyable for the viewers and will give them a better ab workout than P90X. 
Aside from the plot and characters, the animation is done remarkably well but that shouldn't be a surprise since it's from Studio A-1 Pictures who are known for their breathtaking animations. The panels are bold & vibrant and the use of colour red to accentuate the juxtaposition of both love & despair really well highlighted through out the animation of all the episodes. The OP song was definitely a banger and super catchy. The ED song is not as good as the OP song but still decent. The overall OST is decent but it's well used & executed throughout the scenes. However, it isn't the best standalone OST to listen by itself. 
Overall, as a guy who doesn't like romance or romcoms for that matter, I found the show enjoyable to watch. I love a great battle of wits and the refreshing change of pace it brought to this genre is great. You can enjoy the shorts aspect and the episodic feel of this show. It comes off as gag anime at times and other times as something serious with heartfelt emotional scenes. Then again, if you are as emotionless as I am, the smug faces will leave you feeling smug as you watch to see the age old question of yesteryears of ""if two tsunderes liked each other, who will confess first?"" Hopefully this show gets a second season and not just another boost in the manga sale. I wouldn't rewatch this anime but I would definitely recommend this to others. Anyways, give it a watch and tell me later how you found this anime! 
P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",8

                I’ll keep this review simple Love is war isn’t terrible because it’s popular, it’s terrible because nothing happens in the show. I want you to imagine two of your friends wanting to date each other however they both are too proud to admit it to one another. Stretch that for 12 episodes and what you get is a show that will make you sit down for 20 good min of literally nothing. Every episode is like a lead up to progressing the relationship only to go back square 1 with slight variations between each other. For example in one episode they say some endearing things
                  to each other which lead up to a scene that literally would make anyone say now is the time they end up together. Then they instantly fall back to square 1 with now the one of the Mc thinking wow other Mc is so cool. Like that kind of character development is cool and all but it’s ultimately leads up to nothing. If your expecting any major character development here well you might as well read the manga because that’s what this show is a tie in for. Everything else is pretty mediocre all other supporting characters are bland and one dimensional. In all honestly judging by the pacing of the relationship in this show if you enjoy watching a extremely slow sometimes boring set of characters try to motivate a couple of losers that can’t shallow their pride for more than 2 seconds to ask each for the most basic of things any normal people could do, then this show is for you. However if you want to watch a show with actual care for the characters I’d recommend beastars it does the whole “I can’t be admit I love you” thing way better",5
"
                Although it took me more than one episode to get into it, Kaguya-sama: Love is War provided me with entertainment that only got stronger as the show went on. 
Kaguya and Shirogane have a crush on each other, but both are too proud to admit it. Thus many of their encounters turn into psychological games of getting the other to give in. Initially this made their relationship come off as a little creepy, given how they basically want to manipulate the other. This made me a bit wary at first, and the mind battles at first weren’t that interesting, nor did the presentation resonate with
                  me that much. Luckily enough, they began to shift away from these kinds of creepy thoughts and the show eventually focussed more on the comedic aspects of its premise. The reason I personally feel like this is for the better is because the romance would have been developing too slow, although it does get a teeny bit of development over its 12-episode run. Eventually, the mind games began to spread from just these two to other people as well, rounding the show out a bit more. 
On the characters themselves: while I don’t find Shirogane himself that interesting, but enjoyable nonetheless due to his pride and inferiority complex, Kaguya has a more layered personality; cunning, manipulative and proud, but also comically silly. Raised in a wealthy home with a maid (great sidekick role from Hayasaka), which made her sheltered from others, and she has a constant need to prove herself (and probably an inferiority complex), which all shows through her quirky behaviour. While she does make you laugh, she can also annoy you, creep you out, and even make you feel for her. 
And then there is Chika.
Oh Chika, that cute, kind-hearted little bitch that manages to screw over whatever Kaguya or Shirogane are plotting, and we absolutely love her. She may not notice what they are doing or that they are crushing on one another, but she isn’t stupid. Constantly playing around and there to mess around with others, either unknowingly or brutally cunningly. But always in a likeable, cutesy, even funny, manner. 
Plus, there’s Ishigami, the suicidal loner otaku who is sympathetic, hilariously gloomy and cynical. A loser in the show, but a winner for us. 
Now of course, the characters and their stories work even better, because of how this show is animated. It makes as much use of unique visuals and techniques as it could to make the scenes more compelling and funny, including some well-directed shot composition, colour grading and effects. On top of that the character designs are really good. Both Kaguya and Shirogane give of this elegant and cunning demeanour, but when the situation calls for it they can look goofy or cute just by applying body language. Then there is also Chika’s adorable and bubbly look, with pink hair, sweet happy face, with which she can still pull off multiple different dynamic expressions while looking cutesy, and big (but not pervy-looking) chest. Also, Ishigami’s effectively gloomy appearance. 
The OP featuring the song “Love Is War” is fantastic. Showing the crazier side of the shows aesthetic combined with an old-school jazzy soundtrack, like an old James Bond movie, makes it hella fun to experience. Then there is the ED, which does deserve some credit for its production value, and its sweet aftertouch. 
Though the Chika dance ending was only used once, it was very sweet and entertaining, and was great to look at, with the rotoscoping and all. I thought she looked really cute and it is a wholesome clip. 
Every episode consists of two segments, each of them revolving around some conflict between two parties, that often comes off silly, because of how serious it’s taken. Although they aren’t always equally funny, what makes it entertaining is how everyone plays off of each other. And the parts were this is done especially well are often the best ones. 
Although it took a while for me to really get into it at first, as the show went on it quickly developed itself into something I really liked, instead of just being ok.  It is a solid show with good entertainment value and good production, I very much enjoyed it.",8

                My goodness, the romance genre in Anime is surely notorious for its generic concepts. And woe to those who dare take a romance series as their preference, otherwise they will bombarded by critics. '
The reason why Romance is so seemingly generic in Anime is because its simple, and love in the real world is just as simple. But this Anime here is far from simple, it takes on a daringly unique and twisted concept of love. 
This series here will surely cause disruption in the real world, leaving adults and kids in their puberty reevaluating their perception of romance. Contemplating the very existence of the
                  concept behind love.
If you are prepared to be woke, as the kids of this generation would say, then venture bravely into this series. This will definitely open your eyes to the profoundness of love. Love is War after all, will you lose?
TL;DR: Watch this series if you wish to explore an exaggerated yet splendidly amusing series about romance, it comes with a unique concept and twist which I'm sure we can appreciate.",9

                This Anime is Battle of The Wits, like Death Note, Kakegurui, Jojo etc. but what kind of battle is it? is it for Money or Position? no they battle about love, who would confess first her or him? To whoever confess first might ruin their pride or they'll just be laughed at, they battle about this everyday using their wits, make strategies it's hilarious! This is what makes this Anime Great, not your typical Rom-com and it's humorous on it's own way
literally Love Is War lol

P.S. i posted this yesterday and it was at #1 Review so sad it got deleted. so this is a repost with little changes. This is My First Review in MAL 
I've heard praises about the Manga but haven't gotten myself to read it yet, it was in my plan to read for quite some time now. i was surprised when i first heard that this Manga will have an Anime Adaption. I really want to read it because its highly praised by many so i'm hoping for an Anime Adaption (You see i don't really read Mangas unless it realllyyy interests me) i actually wished for this to have an Anime Adaption i guess the Anime God heard me lol. In the Manga reviews it shows that this isn't your typical Rom-Com story

                When a genre has been around for a long time and has been oversaturated, there could be no doubt that sometimes you get a show that decides to put a spin on things. To freshen up and give a new perspective on the genre while still acknowledging what makes the genre enjoyable and why we keep watching them. They will normally have their own gimmick that makes them stand out. In the case of this anime, it asks us the question. What would happen when a Tsundere and a Tsundere liked each other? Well we get this golden gem of an anime.
Sit back, relax and
                  try to get hired as the narrator for someones love life as I present to you the anime review for Kaguya-Sama: Love is War. Lets begin. 
Story: 9.5/10
A relationship is a beloved thing. It is something that can when seen, it is a beautiful thing. People will strive for this. When someone makes the first move and asks the other to go out with them, the couple will bloom into something beautiful and the couple will share their love right?
""USO DE ARU. Asking someone out is a sign of WEAKNESS for the other to take advantage of and DOMINATE him/her. To give them superiority and be the bigger factor of the relationship."" 
That is the mindset of our two main protagonists Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya Shinomiya. The president and vice-president respectively of the renowned Shuchiin Academy's student council. These two act as the top students of the academy and are deeply and madly in love with each other. However, neither will make the first move because because asking the other out is a sign of weakness that will cause them to lose their stature and strive to be a top student. So for the sake of their pride (and egos), they play a battle of wits and try to strategically get the other to confess their feelings and ask out the winner in order to maintain their status as top student and win the war. 
So what we have here are two people taking this situation way too seriously and trying to be the alpha of this relationship. And while it is ridiculous. It also isn't because it can be awkward and nervous to ask someone out and if you are asking someone out, how will they perceive or even take advantage of the situation. So this show uses this fear and overexaggerates it to a well thought out degree. What we have here are two people thinking that they are at war with each other and are such a genius that they can win, when in fact they are actually idiots that are completely deluded. While the show presents them as geniuses, characters like Chika prove that they are taking this way too seriously and it is absolutely brilliant. 
The show also likes to take scenarios and make them a game of wits to win the ""battle"". Normally, each ""battle"" consists of mundane things likes movie tickets, giving love advice and sharing an umbrella. But these things can ignite an relationship so they try to outsmart each other to make them lose this battle. Sometimes Kaguya wins, sometimes Miyuki wins, sometimes they both win and sometimes they both lose. However, they may win the fight, but the war will continue on, hence the name ""Love is War."" The exaggeration makes this show really funny as each situation is treated seriously as if they cannot lose this battle to gain the upper hand. Either going back and forth or something unforeseen throws everything off. This is backed up by a narrator that helps make the situation more dramatic than it seems as he cares to explain the situation as to why this scenario has to be taken seriously. He definitely adds to a scene and helps delve into the mind of what these characters are thinking in order to win the ""battle."" But the main thing about the narrator is that he is absolutely hilarious at doing what he does best, exaggerating the scene to make it stupid but brilliant at the same time.
Characters: 10/10
So our main protagonists, Miyuki and Kaguya are our focus of this show. They are considered top students and are always portrayed as the perfect couple. While that is true, they don't want to admit their feelings because it would mean they would give up their status and would be seen as inferior to the other. So they want to remain as top student but for different reasons. Miyuki has worked and studied hard to get to the position he is now. He will do what it takes to be the best at everything he can do and be a top student. He could never confess to a girl, it would mean everything he worked for and all of his accomplishments would be destroyed. Whereas Kaguya comes from a rich family and was given everything to her to make her rise to the top easier and be superior through skill, knowledge and money; giving her a superiority complex. So both don't want to confess for different reasons. Quite honestly, them confessing early on would make this show boring anyway. But the fact is that different reasons as the why they won't confess helps make them more dynamic and expands their personality and motives to give them depth. Since the cast is small, fleshing out their personality is a priority and this show does this very well and makes them enjoyable. 
But the problem would be that if these two were to play a battle of wits, then the ""war"" would be over quickly or be stuck in a stalemate and we would be stuck with the same episode over and over again. So there must be a wild card to keep things engaging. In this case, the wild card takes the form of Chika Fujiwara who, lets be honest, steals the show. Chika is a rather sweet hearted, free spirited and level headed secretary of the student council. She acts as an unpredictable element in this ""war"" as you don't know if she would shake up the situation. She also acts as a reminder that Miyuki and Kaguya are overthinking the situation and brings us back to reality. She is the kind of character we need to break the tension and give us a different perspective on things. But she really is a character that comes into her own and pretty much becomes the best character of the show. Is she best girl of the season? Nah. Raphtalia is still best girl this season and nothing compares to her. 
""USO DE ARU. This man doesn't want to admit that Chika is best girl this season in order to be in more anime conversations with people"" 
Finally, there is Yuu Ishigami. He was introduced halfway through the show to shake things up and give another perspective. He is the student council's accountant and a rather depressing lad as he is a shut in who would rather stay in the shadows than in the spotlight. Mainly because he is terrified of Kaguya and he thinks she would kill him for knowing what Kaguya has planned to get Miyuki to confess. Now while that might be daft, it is hilarious because given Kaguya's personality, she might actually do it. While he doesn't steal the show like Chika does, he does give another perspective on things and acts as good comic relief. Well that is what I thought for his first two episodes. Now I am torn between him and Chika for the better character of this show. For you see Ishigami is a man of wisdom and always knows what to say and what is the correct action to take. 
Animation: 8.5/10
The animation was done by A-1 pictures, which is weird because this feels like something studio SHAFT would make. The cinematography and intense camera angles really feels like a SHAFT anime. Regardless of that, the production value for this show is really high. This kind of show wouldn't have this much animation put into this but the animation is really good. There are moving panels that cheap its way through and they are numerous, trust me. The rest of the animation is just superb. The camera shots, the intense motions, the character expressions and many other subtle additions to the animation to add to the situation and make it dramatic to make it more ridiculous. They add to the drama and make it more intense. There is also the ending sequence on episode 3 but we will get to that. 
Sound: 9/10
""OH LOVE ME MISTER, OH MIS"" wait, wait, wait, we ain't there just yet. 
So the animation adds to a scene, so what about the soundtrack. Well I'm pleased to tell you that it does add to a scene with a wide variety of soundtracks to really dramatise a scene. Yet it doesn't always have a soundtrack, only when it knows it needs to add a little bit of music to complete a scene. Sound effects as well are used at the right time, even if they sound like stock sound effects you would hear from other shows. There is also a rap scene that was done by Chika that would make Enimmem shiver. Now we just need to have her do a rap battle against Sakura from Zombieland Saga to have the ultimate anime rap battle. 
So the first line from the sound category should tell I love this opening. The opening titled ""Love Dramatic"" by Masayuki Suzuki has so much style to it. Purposely styled and sang like it was an opening you would see and hear in the 80s. It has character, it greatly portrays both the fact they are in love with each other and the fact they are at war with each other. And the song, my god the song is absolutely brilliant with great jazz instruments and vocals that match perfectly with the visuals. IMO, it is the 2nd best opening of the season behind The Promised Neverland's opening. It is, using a word that is used common this season, a banger. 
The ending sequence as well is nice. Reflecting Kaguya finding ""freedom"" and feeling more free spirited thanks to Miyuki and Chika (Probably not so much from Yuu). It is a nice ending sequence that probably would be talked about, if it wasn't the ending sequence played at the end of episode 3. You know the one. The song and dance performance by Chika that has captured the internet by storm due to the animation. Using a technique where the animators animate over a real life person, it is something that doesn't get done often but when it does, it looks really good as getting this quality of animation is very rare. This is an ending sequence that would be remembered for years. 
Conclusion: 
When you have to dramatise a scene, you have to make sure that everything works well with each other, the pacing, the characters, the animation and the sounds have to make sure they work in unison. Kaguya-Sama: Love is War manages to do this very well. It is a well paced, well animated, funny as hell anime that takes a played out romantic comedy genre and manages to feel fresh and invigorating. The characters are what give the show its legs as its small cast is well fleshed out and likeable to help make each episode enjoyable with a narrator that sounds like he is taking this way too seriously. But most important of all. It doesn't burn itself out like other romantic comedies as the comedy is the focus and it does it very well. I do recommend this anime who is looking for a good laugh that is spearheaded by a strong cast and answers the question of what happens when a Tsundere and a Tsundere like each other. 
My personal enjoyment: 10/10
Overall score: 9.4/10 Recommendation: Go f***ing watch it.",9
"
                Kaguya-sama: Love is War is a romantic comedy focused on two student council members of a prestigious and elite high school, Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya Shinomiya, having romantic interest in one another. However, both are too prideful to want to confess their feelings to one another and are in a battle of wits to try getting one another to confess their love with the first to confess being the loser of their battle.
Kaguya-sama’s episodes are formatted as such where there are 2-4 separate segments within each episode that revolve around either Miyuki and Kaguya’s battle of wits to get one another to confess or each
                  character interacting with family and friends. The series is meant to poke fun of typical cliches of the rom-com genre that involve the budding relationships between classmates, as Miyuki and Kaguya attempt to force the other into a confession or manipulate the other into having things go their way for a specific scenario that would typically advance their relationship in a typical romance anime. In these instances, outcomes of the battle of wits vary from one of our two leads getting a victory or a draw resulting from some sort of inconvenience that includes the personal flaws and quirks of both leads or the cheerful student council treasurer Chika unwittingly meddling into the battle between our two leads.
To prevent the format from getting repetitive or monotonous, the segments also include instances where one of our two lead characters interact with members of their family or other classmates. Much like the confession war segments between Miyuki and Kaguya, many of the characters that the leads interact with have their own comical quirks that serve to inconvenience or befuddle the lead characters to some extent. For the most part, the characters have enough dimension to their personalities where they don’t fully fall under a character type, though they don’t necessarily develop at all throughout Kaguya-sama’s run as the series is more focused on the comical interactions between the cast than any serious developments with them. So anyone expecting our main couple’s relationship to develop at all throughout Kaguya-sama’s run may be disappointed to find that the show goes nowhere at advancing it.
Much like other comedy titles of its ilk, you can either like or dislike how it delivers its humor and how well you warm up to the characters. While I do applaud the series for having a premise that breaks the typical mold you would find out of many school comedies that have over-relied on familiar story structures in recent years, I must sadly admit that I was rather indifferent to much of the comedy delivered throughout Kaguya-sama’s run. It is still largely dependent on the typical tropes of high school comedies to carry its humor and I didn’t really find myself connecting with any of the characters since there still wasn’t enough dimension to them where I could identify with them to any degree beyond whatever character types they personify. Also, I found the narration used for Kaguya-sama’s comedy to be rather obnoxious at many points throughout the series as it seemed the narrator was trying too hard to hammer on the comedy in Miyuki and Kaguya’s conflict.
Overall in spite of the show’s fanfare, I just didn’t care much for what Kaguya-sama: Love is War offered with its comedy in spite of its premise sticking out from recent premises and episode structures of high school anime comedies. I found I was more receptive to the high school rom-com parody offered up from School Rumble nearly 15 years earlier, which is a bit more manic and exaggerated in its comedy compared to Kaguya-sama. If Kaguya-sama’s style of comedy isn’t your cup of tea yet you are still craving for a parody of high school rom-coms, I’d say give School Rumble a shot instead.",5

                Not more than a year ago... One of the few friends I had messaged me the link of a YouTube video and said ""watch it.. It's great"". I wondered what it was so I clicked on it. As soon as the video started.... An anime girl with pink hair and a bow dressed in a school uniform was dancing in a room overlooking an open window. She was incredibly cute and the dance was great. And the beats in the song could give even the coolest of club bangers a run for their money. On further Googling I found out that the girl was Chika
                  Fujiwara from the anime that I am going to talk about. It was a comedy anime from spring 2019 season. It was flooded with great reviews and rule 34 artists were going haywire because of the two female main characters. So I said to myself ""go on. Try it. It's not like you have anything else to do"" 
So I did. 
You may have already known from my Score that I am not impressed and that's true but for very valid reasons. I am not the one who tries to bash popular stuff to get some elitist ecstasy. So hear me out guys okay. 
So, the first thing is story. I wanted to leave the section blank cause there isn't any story. But then the reader would assume I am just a hater. No I am not. The problem with episodic anime is that you don't feel a sense of progression if there isn't a frame story to go with episodic core story in each episode. Frame stories are the larger background plots that keep on moving forward as each episodic story ends. For example....Evangelion was episodic but with each passing episode Shinji came closer to defeat the angel armada. I know the genres of Kaguya sama and Evangelion are poles apart but i only mentioned it to explain what frame story means. In kaguya sama... There is no frame story. Each episode has no correlation with the previous one so you won't even know if you skipped an episode or two while watching. It feels very disjointed. Kinda reminded me of Tom and Jerry days when one got hurt... They were back to normal in the very next scene. So the characters interactions that happens between the council members are nothing more than anecdotes with some jokes in it. The characters never refer to older events in the show hence the narrative kinda just resets itself every 8 minutes. No matter what happens.... The council members come back to square one every time. In fact. If you separated the individual stories and asked a viewer to sort them in the order they happened..... He would fail.... Because there is no linearity in the plot with each episode ending with zero consequences and no permanent effects. And I won't take the excuse that ""comedy anime don't need a story"". Prison school had a story which was continuous and well paced with a great payoff at the end. 
Coming to the structure and script of the show, it's as dull as a weeb's dating history. There are several problems so I would go one by one addressing them. First of all.... The narrator. Who in the seven hells thought that a third person narrator would do any good to the story. Nothing ruins a joke more than explaining it. That dude not only explains the joke but what the speaker meant, what the listener interpret it as and what was actually supposed to be the funny part of it. It feels really insulting to me as a viewer that the writer thinks that I am too dumb to get the joke myself. The ""tell"" in show or tell methods of narration is for the less intelligent people. And the narrators existence clearly shows the show uses a ""tell"" approach. Another thing that irked me was the narrator's routine of keeping scores of the ""mind battles"" between Kaguya and Shirogane. Not only is this irritating because of absence of well defined parameters to award or deduct points but also feels like a waste of time because the scores are neither cumulative nor they have any consequences whatsoever. So it feels nothing more than a pretentious mess. 
Another problem that the show suffers from is in its setting. Shuichin Academy is the school for the most elite students in the country. But judging from the glimpses given in the show of the school students' life.... It hardly feels that they are anything more than retards or bimbos. All of them keep loitering in the school corridors and do nothing more than discuss ""who is dating whom"". Every once in a while.... Some guy or girl come to the student council room to ask for dating advice from the main characters as if that's all they care about. There are no instances of any classes going on in the school and there is not a single adult present. It is the same problem which one of my least favourite anime ""kakegurui"" suffers from. In such cases. The high school setting feels nothing more than an unnecessary add-on detail to appeal to the given demographic of viewers. 
If Shuichin Academy is the best school in the country.... It should have one of the most active, engaging and busy Student Councils ever. No but it's not the case in this anime. The student council here is one of the laziest and most irresponsible I have ever had the misfortune to know about. All four of the main characters do nothing but waste their Time discussing silly scenarios and playing useless mind games which are the farthest thing from any productivity which should be the council's utmost priority.  Let me tell  something.... the author made them a part of the Student Council only so that he could separate them from the rest of the students in a single room so that they can play those crappy mind games in peace. I would not make fun of someone if he/she forgot who was the vice president or the Secretary or the financial manager cause those details are rendered irrelevant due to the Student Council doing basically nothing other than the stupid thing that is their episodic misadventures. Chika has all the time in the world to give lectures on society, dance in the council room and trying out dresses of the drama club.... but she doesn't spend even a fraction of it studying even her academic prowess is far less than that of the main leads. Kaguya could have easily topped her class if she gave as much time to studies as she gives in crafting situations to make Shirogane confess. 
The comedy of the show is really the worst part of it. The jokes are really cringey and unfunny. Sometimes the quality drops so hard that even EDM beats can be put to shame. They based an entire episode on the same ""Weiner"" joke by making Chika repeat it throughout. Kaguya found it really funny for very strange reasons and the viewer was expected to laugh. The ""mind games"" of the show are just pretentious made up scenarios glorified as a battle of wits. Each of the two leads constantly keeps making overboard assumptions and responds with more outrageous strategies than the last one. It really makes me pity both of them. If only they had talked to each other instead of playing the games..... They could have understood each other much better. 
The characters of the show are a bigger joke than any of those in the script. First we have Kaguya.... A rich spoiled Tsundere whose father has a net worth of 200 trillion yen. Yes you heard it right... That's like 2 trillion dollars or almost 40% of Japan's annual value of the goods and services or in simple terms GDP. This world make him more than 16 times richer than the current richest person in the world. I know the author wanted to portray her father as a rich man but he should have alteast came up with a realistic number. This is just me nitpicking as it is not that big a problem. The bigger ones are coming up. 
Kaguya is shown to be successful in almost all fields possible. In academics, arts and sports. But these traits are never demonstrated. People come to her for dating advice but no one came to her for advice on these 3 fields which she apparently excels in. If the students themselves don't care about her supposed accomplishments then why should I. She or Miyuki both have the problem of putting their egos before their feelings. That's why the show even exists. They clearly love themselves and their reputation more than the other person. So they... As a couple can't even hold a candle in        
front of some ""actually good"" anime couples. They live in a stupid dilemma that making the first move is a weakness and is totally not worth the companionship of the significant other. That's why I really despise them. Right from episode 1... Kaguya entered my hit list because of the way she body shamed Chika for having big breasts which I don't have the slightest idea why the author thought it was even remotely funny. In an episode, Kaguya hides Miyuki's phone battery so that he cannot go home without asking for help from her. And even if he did ask... She wouldn't help him cause it would make it seem like she confessed. That's some peak level stupidity. Not only did she intentionally put him in a state of misery but also chose not to put him out ot it. That's just straight up bullying. My mind exploded with frustration in episode 11 after the bedroom incident. Kaguya was angry at Shirogane because he was on his bed even though she was the one who asked him to do so. She thought that Miyuki was gonna make a move on her and hence she bashed him for something he didn't do. At the same time... She was angry at him because he DIDN'T make a move on her signifying that he doesn't find her that seductive. The hypocrisy shown by Kaguya in this incident was more than what Suzaku showed in both seasons of Code Geass combined. And that is hard to beat. 
Kaguya's maid Hayasaka is just a typical kuudere whose only significance is being a secondary waifu. But i really love her. She is best girl of the show for me and therefore an object of my dominatrix fantasies 
Chika is cute. I get it. She gave us lots of memes and all but that's it. As I already said... She abuses her position in the council by doing stupid stuff instead of something productive. Her affection for her firends is superficial at best. She asks them not to go to see fireworks together as she won't be present even though she herself is taking a trip to Spain and stranding her friends. This ""concern"" of hers is thrown out of the window in cases where she is the only one who gains anything out of it. I don't have anything else to point out cause there is nothing more to her than being the cute stupid bimbo of the show. 
Ishigami was another attempt by the author to make a relatable character for the antisocial demographic of the show... Which itself isn't bad but it feels like unpolished work if the character has no personality and just one joke ""I am going home"". He is a complete failure in studies but somehow magically is very good at handling accounts which is kinda correlative with the commercial maths which is usually taught at school. Kakashi from Naruto gave more expressions with one eye than Ishigami gave with his entire face throughout the show. 
I kept Miyuki for last cause he is the character I dislike the least . The problems which he faces are actually shown to us on screen such as his weak financial condition and the strained relationship with his father. He never initiated the stupid mind games and he might have even confessed to  kaguya and put us out of the misery that is the show but he needlessly participates in them cause he too has an ego as big as Kaguya's. He is the only Council member who was actually shown studying which was kinda necessary considering that he is the best student of the best school in the country. But even his character is handled poorly by the author by needlessly attaching a pseudo incest plot line with his sister. Although there is no concrete proof but I am not the first person to suspect that. He is frequently a victim of Kaguya's mischief but he chose not to retaliate because our man has some sense of chivalry which is........ Great. 
The music in the show is a work of art. The opening theme wakes up the dancer inside me like no other. I never knew I had a thing for classic jazz music until the show's music crawled into my ears. The ending theme is a great piece too and the visuals of it were really creative. Especially the plane scene. The chika dance song is the bearer of one of the most chad beats I ever heard. Coming to voice acting, I am in love with Aoi Koga as Kaguya. She really sounds like a lovestruck teenager with zero experience in romantic endeavours. Konomi Kohara as Chika is just a tsunami of cuteness whose reaction noises gave birth to more memes than Elon Musk. Makoto Furukawa is already the voice actor of my favourite character of all time (Saitama in One Punch Man) so I can listen to any character voiced by this gentleman. 
The art of the show unlike it's story and characters is really great. The character designs are great and the girls look insanely cute. Although I do feel that setting the entire story in a single room made me suspect that the animators wanted to cut corners in the background designs. I think that's kind ot a nitpick so I can let it pass. 
Overall... People love this show. I don't. I wouldn't have even bothered watching it if it wasn't that much of a hype generator. I just felt that there are several problems with it which the ""fans"" obviously missed or chose to ignore.. But I just can't. It came out as a really trashy show for me and that's the reason why I am not expecting any upvotes in my review. 
That's it from me..... Adieu",4
"
                 The quality of the animation in Kaguya-sama is okay but not good enough to pull off the SHAFT dealy it's trying to replicate. Bakemonogatari's animation is clean and refreshing. I thought Kaguya's was scruffy and disorientating. 
The narrator needs to either go or take a lesser role in the anime. I know the show is supposed to be a competition between the two main characters and having an announcer fits into that concept, but the guy not only has a grating voice but also talks too much. His explanations, of which there were many, felt like interruptions and stopped me from immersing myself in
                  the show. I feel like the show would have been better if the main characters took over his role and explained the situation by internally monologueing. 
If there is any relational complexity then the episode failed to communicate it to me in the first episode. To me, their relationship just seemed like cheap, flat material there to serve as fodder for skits.
The skits aren't very good: the punchlines are obvious, the execution is poor, character reactions are cookie cutter, and the content is unrelatable.
Kaguya-sama is about a battle between two geniuses. The show should be smart. It's not. Kaguya-sama does throw about fancy terms like Chaos Theory, but based on what I saw in the first episode what actually happens is pretty basic. If the smart concept is e=mc^2 then all the show does with it is fill in the variables and then call it a day.
I've only seen half of the first episode before dropping the show so a lot of the issues I mentioned may have been resolved further into the show. I also likely missed Kaguya-sama's strong points of which there are probably many given the show's popularity.
So perhaps it gets better, but I think that first impressions, especially those of comedy shows, are important. Kaguya-sama completely bombed its.",5
"
                A1 pictures have come a long way since they produced their first show Big Windup in 2007. Ever since then the studio has produced numerous animes that were based on Light Novels, Video Games, and Manga. Some of their popular works are Sword Art Online, Your Lie in April, Fairy Tail, The Idolm@ters, Black Butler and Anohana. Despite all of that I've partially never been a fan of their works because their works seem to suffer from bad execution.
When heard that Kaguya Sama was going to be produced by A1 Pictures I expected it to be another A1 trainwreck filled with pretty colours with no
                  substance, incoherent plot that struggled to make sense and shameless waifu pandering. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case at all. What I got instead is a well written, charming and stylish show that singly handly brought me back to loving modern romcoms again after watching a bunch of mediocre to terrible modern romcoms in the last couple of years.
Character chemistry and comedy structure is the key of Kaguya Sama Love is War successes. 
Before I talk Kaguya Sama successes at character chemistry and comedy structure I will be talking about why many romcoms fail.  To me, the most important element for any rom-com is character chemistry.
I've seen many rom-com anime crumble down before my eyes just because of the authors/directors failed to understand the importance of character chemistry.
When you have characters talk over each other without letting the other person speak nor having characters be total dipshits to each other for no reason then you got yourself some bullshit on your hand to every other element from romance, love triangles dating and plot twits get negated.
Thankfully Kaguya Sama doesn't fall in those traps.
The characters perfectly bounce with each other whenever its for humour or drama.
It creatively plays with my most hated cliches in anime being pointless misunderstandings. At times the characters may be a jerk to one another but these misunderstandings and jerk moments spice up the psychological elements in the show being the mind games.
Furthermore, these characters truly care and support one another as shown in the character-focused and post mind games segments.
It knows how it set up its gags/comedy correctly, and it knows to deliver the punchline effectively.
Kaguya Sama understands comedic timing and that aspect along really spices up the already masterful character chemistry in the show.
One of the unique additions of Kaguya Sama is the inclusion of a narrator that either enhance the comedy or plays with the character monologues. That feature alone made Kaguya Sama stand out from other romcoms plot and writing-wise and speaking about the plot.
This show plot is absolutely fantastic. To say that this show plot is well-executed wouldn't give this show justice at all.
Kaguya Sama is a romcom anime with a unique twist which that's a battle anime of the minds. Every episode we see Kaguya and Miyuki trying to confess to one another in the most ridiculous and mind screwing ways possible. I found every single battle to be engaging as not only the show is outstandingly well-paced but thanks to the aforementioned brilliant comedy structure the show becomes an unpredictable and hilarious thrill ride that hade me laugh. It's beautifully paced, the gags never outstay their welcome and most of all this show is stylishly self-aware.
I must applaud the series director Shinichi Omata for taking full advantage for the medium that he is in as he made the anime adaptation the Kaguya Sama the definitive version of the story with fast pacing that synergies well the written story and characters of Kaguya Sama.
Naturally, the driving force for any romcom anime are the characters which once again Kaguya Sama excels.
Kaguya herself is without a question one of the best rom-com leads I have ever seen period, and she's a fantastic character at that. I loved her dynamic chemistry towards the rest cast. She's funny, super likeable and overall very dynamic.
On top of being a dynamic and likeable female lead that is fulled of personality, she's also a very well written character that you can sympathise with. Through the 12 episode run, we learn so much as Kaguya from her been always transported to school instead of walking by herself due to family reasons to how she was a cold and manipulative person who never had any friends before joining the student council.
Running along as my second favorite character is Miyuki Shirogane I originally didn't care for him in my first watch as I kept on re-watching this show multiple times he began to grow to a point he became not only the most interesting character of the show, but also as become one of my favorite rom-com leads period. Compare to Kaguya he comes from a rather poor background with no royal standings. Despite this he never lets his past overtake his determination.
Just like with Kaguya he gets a lot of character development through character segments. The Kaguya focused ones may be my favourite but the Miyuki focused ones were the most interesting due to them diving to his poor background.
I was a bit scared when I saw Chika because I had a bad experience with comedic refiles in anime mainly because they either outstay they, welcome or exist to screw up the tone with their unfunny and dry humour.
Luckily Chika doesn't fall into the pitfalls of other comedic relief characters. I would even go as far that she's one of the best comedic reliefs ever. She's the Joker playmaker of the show's brilliant comedy and seeing her mess around with the Kaguya and Miyuki always put a big smile on my face effectively treating them as her playthings of chaos.
She surprisingly gets some character development in the show partially in one episode where she volunteers to help Miyuki at improving his throw for volleyball. That alone really shows the human side of Chika. Even though she the Joker of the show she's willing to help and support her friends in need.
Oh, by the way, the Chika dance in episode two is one of the most brilliant things, I have seen from the last decade. Seriously whoever came up with the Chika dance should have won an award.
Lastly we the Yu Ishigami. The depressed emo dude who steals the scene everytime he shows up on screen. From he's over the top antics at his relatable character development in the season which will get expand upon in season 2 Yu adds another layer to the shows great humour.
You cannot help but feel bad for him every time he's on-screen. Yu has a strong character dynamic towards the cast.
There's not much I can say about the supporting characters because are barely any, to begin with. Other than Kaguya's personal valet Ai the supporting characters seem to come and go.
For the longest time, I wasn't a fan of A1 Pictures art style as many of the shows especially the LN adaptations look the same. Yes, there was a few exceptions like Wotaku, Black Butler and Magi but more often or not A1 Pictures have a nasty habit of using the same character models for their shows.
Lucky the visuals staff of A1 Pictures decided to ditch out their generic character model practice in favour of staying very fateful to Aka Akasaka art-style and because of that Kaguya is a beautiful spectacle. From the visual direction, background scenery and character designs A1 Pictures did a fantastic job at bringing Aka Akasaka art-style to life. Add this up to the stylish clean colour palette and striking animation and you end up with a beautifully stylish show. This is A1 Pictures at its best when it comes to presentation and I don't think it will ever be topped.
The soundtrack of Kaguya Sama is phenomenal. It features a diverse musical score of orchestral, trumpet, violin, piano tracks that give the show atmosphere and tension.
Kaguya Sama soundtrack is made better by the show's brilliant use of sound effects which perfectly land along with the comedic timing.
The opening and ending themes are fantastic. Not only they were catchy songs in their own, but they are filled with visual flair that perfectly captured the tone of the anime.
Honestly, this show screams passion and effort and the opening and ending themes for Kaguya are no expectation.
The voice acting is top all across the board and since this is a psychological rom-com I can tell that the Seiyuus had a blast voicing their respective characters. Best performances go to rising stars Aoi Koga as Kaguya and Konomi Kohara as Chika.
At the time of this review there's no English Dub but thanks to Funimation recently licencing the series it will get a dub sometime this year. All I can say is please don't screw it up.
Kaguya Sama is a textbook example of how to do a rom-com anime. It is an anime that filled with passion and soul which many rom-com from the last decade lack. The over the top stylish nature may not certainly be for everyone but if you can pass that then you end with amazingly crafted rom-com that has splendid visuals, superb characters, magnificent character chemistry, and a splendid soundtrack.
If you're tired of watching mediocre romcom anime from the last decade, I strongly recommend Kaguya Sama Love is War. It's a fantastic piece that I will gladly remember for a long time and I pray that season 2 will be just as good if not better than season 1.",9
"
                Review: For people who have at least read the synopsis
If not then here's a short description of the plot:
(free to skip)
This is a school anime which revolves around the student council consisting mainlty of President Miyuko Shirogane (He is a smart dude who tops the practical exams) and Vice President Kaguya Shinomiya (Daughter of a wealthy Conglomerate family and Multi-talented). Despite liking each other, they both are full of pride and are too full of themselves to confess their love. They believe whoever does so first would lose. The story is based on their many attempts to make one other confess first.
Apart from them, there
                  is another student council member, the Secretary, Chika Fujiwara who likes to gossip and often throws a wrench in Shinomiya and Shirogane's plans due to her unpredictability.
Story: 9/10
'Kaguya-Sama: Love is War' is a great show with a nicely told story. I personally felt like the first 40 seconds were really powerful as they describe about the anime's true content and as to why Miyuki and Kaguya are trying to get one another to fall in love with each other. I also like how they end each scene by telling who won. Each episode perfectly describes the nature of the characters.
The story is really good. The president is super smart and the vice president is super rich and multi talented. Everyone in the school ships them or believes they are dating. Chika Fujiwara is another character who brings plot twist and changes the mood in some episodes. I really like the humor of this anime even in serious scenes, for instance, how the President thinks that any wrong action might make Kaguya say ""How cute"" which isn't what he wants. It can even be noted as the specialty of the anime.
The story is unique and not at all predictable. I haven't seen any anime as this one. This is a Rom/Com with it's own special story. The episodes may contain more than one scene and lets the viewers know. There aren't many literary devices used. There are times when the characters are fighting and fail because of their flaws. The episodes aren't rushed and are well shown.
The characters are unique in their own way. By their nature, you may think it makes the plot super simple but NO! The story is entertaining in its own way.
Art:8/10
I think the art is really good however not the best. The shadow under the President's eyes make him unique. I believe this is one of the great works of A-1 Pictures. I think the girls in the anime (Chika Fujiwara and Kaguya) are cute and the President's looks makes him fit into his character.
The animation is smooth and the expressions of the characters are really great. Some of it actually makes the story better, adds humor and makes it way better. 
Most of the story takes place in the Student Council room or sometimes other places. It is shown nicely and the art is simply great!
Sound:9/10
I really loved all of the opening/ending songs of this anime. The ending song changes quite a bit but they are all great. I find them rather special. When I'm finding an anime I think it's music adds a plus point to it. 
The voice actors were amazing too. The way they speak defines their nature and even their thoughts are expressed crystal clear. I think I'll listen to the OST again in future. Kudos to halca, the theme song performer and Jin Aketagawa, the sound director.
Character: 9/10
All the characters have their own personalities. You may find some unexpected things about the characters later in the show. The two of the main characters: Kaguya and Miyuki have their own strengths and flaws. Their strength are mentioned earlier and as for their flaws, make sure to watch the series to find out!! >.<
There is very little character development since the characters already have a fixed personality but through their action we can tell that they have changed. There are few characters and are perfect for the show.
The show has a narrator who explains everything making it easier for the viewers and helps to end the scene in a decent way sometimes. 
For now, I don't specifically dislike any of the characters. There aren't many supporting characters but I think the show is fine that way.
I'll definitely remember the characters in the future! (Since they are less in number and each has a certain specialty different from other)
Enjoyment: 9/10
I really enjoyed the show! People who like Rom/Com will no doubt like this show. Maybe not everyone will like the show thinking that the plot is stupid (It really isn't but I've met such people). It is really entertaining, trust me. I think mostly teenagers or any other young person would like this series. I've been watching a lot of on-going animes and this is definitely one of them that I would remember! If given the chance to, I would gladly accept the ownership of this show. I would re-watch it because this show has got a lot of scenes (Even more than 2 scenes in a single episode). This will make remembering every detail very hard so I would forget it. This way, even re watching would be fun!",9
"
                It's a Romantic Comedy
So what happens when a tsundere and a tsundere tired to get the other to confess to the other?. Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen is the tale of Miyuki Shirogane voiced by Makoto Furukawa the student council president and Kaguya Shinomiya voiced by Aoi Koga the vice president as they have ""matches"" to try and get the other one to confess, we also have the chaos factor herself and secretary of the student council and LA's waifu of the Winter 2019 season Chika Fujiwara voiced by Konomi Kohara to stir the pot between the two to make things interesting and
                  finally Yuu Sihigami voiced by Ryouta Suzuki who just wants to be left alone Think this setup would get boring over time...HELL NO, with the brilliant direction and intense ""battles"" Miyuki and Kaguya goes through to almost ""Death Note"" levels of preparedness and the great overreactions and great animation to pull it all off, the setup NEVER gets boring and again...Chika being the chaos factor she is really does make the more mundane situation be that much more intense.
Of course due to the minimal cast, this is going be something of intense romantic comedy with some sense of character and relationship development, just with the consistent want of Miyuki and Kaguya wanting the other to confess with one another and using ANY means to get it. With that being said Miyuki and Kaguya and heck Chika and Ishigami gets subtle development both in backstory and character changes as the anime goes along. Miyuki is set up like your typical ""student council president"" but being from a poor background, he's something of a cheapskate and an extremely hard worker that got him the position of student council president but he lacks in anything new to him as a result. Kaguya is seen as the ice queen but even at the start of the anime, she's already shed some ice but being from a rich family she's not your typical ojou....well more like the laughing smug ojou but still. As for Chika...well she's Chika and she's one of the main powerhouse sources of comedy throughout the entire anime, helped by her voice actor Konomi Kohara with all her deliveries. 
As much as the ""relationship"" between Miyuki and Kaguya is pretty much stalled throughout the entire anime due to their constant battles for a confession, LA will note that it's not only the journey and experiencing their battles that's great about their relationship but subtly you can see through strife and tribulations they go through, deep down they love each other, they just can't spit it out, otherwise one of them will ""lose"" as it were and LA actually likes this about the two, makes them much more complex and cliche at the same time. Ohh and Kaguya obvious gets LA's second favorite character of the series as she gets her moments both moe and her crazy reactions.
LA will also note that as much as Miyuki and Kaguya and hell throw Chika in there as well are in the forefront of the anime, and most of the supporting characters are ""support"" they do have some screentime that is ALSO used for both the minor characters development as well as Miyuki and Kaguya like Ai Hayasaka serving under Kaguya to the struggling couple of Kashiwagi and Tsubasa and all the advice they get from Miyuki and Kaguya reflecting their own romance towards each other.
The animation done by A1-Pictures is absolutely amazing. No joke, it's like the animation was injected with SHAFTiness but the proper amount that it's not taxing and annoying. LA says this as each transition and symbolism and heck visual representation of animation was greatly done to reflect the characters' headspace and thinking and for a mindgame anime where your trying to get your crush to confess to you, this works extremely well. Great character deisgns, their great reactions, the exotic, polished and well detailed, backgrounding work coupled with the atmospherically chaotic and symbolic animation sense was done in a great direction that uses it's runtime extremely well. Seriously the director, Shinichi Omata MUST had been a fan of Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen to put in this much detail and get A1-Pictures in their A Game it's AMAZING.
Konomi Kohara and Aoi Toga, seriously these two knocked it out of the park, Konomi just came from Asobi Asobase, now starting off strong in 2019 with Chika as Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen, LA already said in the character section, but Konomi Kohara did a STELLAR job in voicing Chika right down to her reactions and deliveries of her one liner and heck even some of her ""noises"" were great and moe as heck. Aoi Koga as Kaguya was amazing as well and coming from a rookie seiyuu as well, this is her star making role if anything in LA's eyes as she nailed it as Kaguya getting both her intense scary cadence and to immediately flip into adorable moe on a dime was priceless to say the least. Aoi Koga, a name to remember in the future and LA will be expecting more from her. Now Ryouta Suzuki and Makoto Furukawa aren't getting by without a passing mention either as they did amazing in many respects with Makoto Furukawa's stoic but scared cadence as Miyuki and with Ryouta's outright constant nervousness as Ishigami. Yumiri Hanamori as Ai Hayasaka was welcoming with her voicing a deadpan snarker and hell LA didn't know DIO was Shirogane's dad! Brilliant, brilliant voice cast, LA wished to gush more but you get the gist.
Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen was one of the best non-sequel anime for Winter 2019 and LA wholeheartedly will say to watch this anime, be it if your a romance anime fan wanting something different or not, it's hardly formulaic if the anime and it's premise does new things to shake up the formula time and again and with a lovable cast of character that subtly develop over time even with all the intense confession battles going on and with it's amazing production and animation, this was easily one of LA's favorite and most tuned in anime of Winter 2019 and LA just wanted more.

                One of the overhype anime. It's above average but there is not enough strong point to keep you to watch. If it's not that i want to watch romance between Kaguya, I would already drop this.
The start of the anime is not bad. The mind game is still tolerable and kinda cool, but later it turned to be just plain gag. Worst is the dub, author thought something very ordinary you might not know and have to explain it in detail that it felt like filler. I'm not sure if that's japanese joke but it's so repetitive.
The thing I don't like the most is creativity,
                  there is none. Nothing new in confession war, but the same idea.
The only thing I like and recommend in this anime is romance. It's not super romantic but still not bad.
Edit: This is my subjective review on season 1. The story+romance is getting a lot better on season 2 but not the mind game. If you already done with ss1 by chance, try out ss2.",2

                When I saw the episode one for 5 mins I stopped watching and closed the site. It was so kind of frustrating to listen to the narrators voice it almost made my ears bleed. 
But after 2-3 weeks one of my friend who has a good anime knowledge suggested me this anime. And it was growing popular day by day so I thought let's give it a try again. Then I started from the 1st episode again, somehow managed to go through 2 episodes but after starting the 3rd episode I was unable to resist the urge to watch the next episode.
Man it's so comical/funny
                  I couldn't believe that it was going to be this best. The narrator sound may seem to be frustrating to many people during the start but thats also an important part of this great anime, so bear with it and watch this whole series. I am telling you, you will not regret watching this anime. Their is story, comedy and even the seriousness of this anime is comical. You will laugh in this whole anime. It sure is refreshing if you are feeling sad or gloomy.
The characters are all great and the chemistry between Kaguya and Mr. President is so great you will definitely love it. I will definitely recommend this anime to those who love Comedy, Romance. It's not going to be seriously Romantic but still it is Romance. The second season is also great, I can't wait for the next one. 
Overall this anime deserves 10/10.",10
"
                After watching a wide number of anime with the ""romance"" tag in the last years, I was starting to lose my hopes in finding another decent one. This Winter I found many interesting action titles, but I needed something to just chill an relax during the week. To my surprise, I found the title of Kaguya-sama: Love is War under the comedy, and  romance tags and I couldn't be happier by that. 
Story: 
The story follows the president of the prestigious Shuchiin Academy student council and its vice president Shinomiya Kaguya, along with their daily issues to accept that they've fell in love with
                  each other. Both of them are too proud to admit their feelings and confess to the other part, since for them whoever confesses first will lose. To avoid this defeat they reached the following conclusion: to win in love you must make the other part confess. Their battles are interesting to watch and really fun, don't think that you'll see a Death Note level mental battle, but Shirogane and Kaguya think carefully about different strategies to force the other person to say... ""I love you"". 
Each episode is divided in three parts, and each part presents a different situation that'll unleash a different battle. The first episodes focus more in comedy, but the last ones give more importance to their bonds and allow us to appreciate how close they've become with each other and with the other members of the council. The romantic vibe takes more strength in these final episodes as well. 
Art: 
Once you start watching this series, it's evident that A-1 Pictures has poured all its love into it. I really like how the Academy portrays the class and elegance that it's supposed to represent. The backgrounds and furniture are well detailed and that's something I really appreciate. The character designs are also an improvement from the manga, and the level of cuteness is taken to a completely new level. I mean, I've never seen someone blushing as beautifully as Kaguya or a dance as cute as Fujiwara's. You want moe? Don't go anywhere else! Another important aspect of the art,  is facial expressions.  Here you'll either laugh by what's actually happening, by the voice acting or simply thanks to the facial expressions. Simply brilliant. 
Sound: 
Usually, finding a comedy with a good soundtrack is a difficult task. However, this isn't the case. The comedic moments are well supported by the right sounds and all the voice actors deliver the emotion of the moment in a spectacular way. ""BRAKE ISHIGAMI!"" has to be the line that has made me laugh the most during this year. The narrator also makes an outstanding job in explaining  the inner battles between the main characters and how they feel in the middle of them, making their mental battles even more interesting to watch. Now let's not forget the OP! It has one of the most catchy songs from the season and will  be repeating itself in your head every time you finish an episode. The ED is also really nice and of course don't forget Fujiwara's dance at the end of ep 3. It only happened once, but was enough to stay in our minds forever. 
Characters:
The cast of characters is short but memorable for sure. At first glance it might seem like we're in front of a bunch of stereotyped characters. Of course, this isn't the case. In this show we've the pleasure of meeting a diverse cast in terms of personality. 
The president Shirogane Miyuki is the number one student in the Academy, but this isn't because he belongs to a high class family that positioned him there, actually it's all the opposite. Miyuki comes from a poor family and is even considered as a workaholic by the other members of the council due to his obsession with earning what he wants with hard work. His behavior constantly gives rise to different comedic situations in which he gets involved in the activities of rich people and feel completely out of place. I really enjoyed him as the male lead and the difference of social classes between him and Kaguya made their chemistry even better. 
The vice president Shinomiya Kaguya shares some similarities with the president, but at the same time they're completely opposite poles. Like Shirogane, Kaguya is a brilliant student that's admired by the other students because of her intelligence and beauty. Both of them are extremely popular students who take their duties in the student council quite seriously. However, as I mentioned before their social backgrounds make them see their daily life from a completely different perspective.  She was strictly raised under a wealthy family,  and her knowledge about themes like sex is limited to what we learn in Primary School. Some viewers have mentioned that her behavior is childish for a girl who is 16, but let's remember that she has never had any friends before she could get along with the other members of the school council and her family is barely present in her life. With this in mind, it's evident that she has never been exposed to mature subjects and that her knowledge about love and human relationships is limited. So I can understand why she acts shyly whenever she comes across a subject that is almost unknown to her.
The Secretary Fujiwara Chika is all the opposite from Kaguya and Shirogane. She innocnetly ruins their plans all the time, but no matter how many times she does this it's impossible to dislike her. She has one of the cutest designs I've ever seen and her open personality is a plus. Her IQ is of 3, but I don't think she's dumb. She can even dominate the French language, unlike the president himself. She always says what's on her mind and this honesty makes a nice contrast between her and Kaguya. 
Fujiwara is an energetic girl that also genuinely cares about Kaguya. Despite Kaguya getting mad at Fujiwara because she always gets in the middle of her plans, she always ends up finding out that Fujiwara is the best friend she can ever have.
Now I must talk about The Man, and no, I'm not referring to Becky Lynch but to our precious treasurer of the student council Yuu Ishigami. Ishigami is the kind of character that appears much later in the story just to steal the show. As many on here have mentioned before, he's  the most relatable character in the story, the one who feels real the most in this series. He's an expert in analyzing data, but he's a loner with great issues to socialize. He always says what he thinks, without analyzing the effect that'll have in the other people. This constantly puts him in trouble, especially with both Fujiwara and Kaguya. He's a genius in terms of technology and videogames, but totally fails with his grades and social relationships. Ishigami thinks that Kaguya wants to kill him, but after a certain event he realizes that she isn't as cold as she seems and also after many episodes, it gets noticeable that his relationship with Shirogane has gotten really close. 
Finally, a special mention to Kaguya's maid, Hayasaka Ai who encouraged Kaguya all the time to pay attention to her own feelings and stole the show every time she was on screen. All the maids in anime should be like her. 
Enjoyment: 
This winter season gave me many great titles to enjoy, but after a couple of weeks this was the one I was looking forward the most. I was never bored and was always interested in the story and the characters. Definitely one of the most enjoyable experiences ever and my favorite rom com from all time. 
Overall: 
I'd recommend this show to anyone who enjoys the comedy genre or to anyone who's looking for a light romance story. However, the idea of two people looking for a way to make the other part confess their love might not be attractive for some, or the concept can get repetitive. Also, the innocence of the characters in terms of love might be childish for others.  If you're looking for a serious romance with lots of drama and twisted pasts, go away from here and watch something else. But if you're just looking for an entertaining story about two characters with issues to deal with their first love, then go ahead and enjoy!",9
"
                Overrated.
Well this anime certainly has become a surprise hit in many metrics apparently striking the right nerve in the community using the ever same overused formula of Romcom and some made-to-be-cute characters. Objectively speaking though there's very little positive which you could actually say about this show.
You can sum up the anime like this: Dude and Girl are into each other but due to some poorly constructed excuse of a delusion both suffer from which makes them believe that confessing first puts you into an inferior position in a relationship, they strive to make each other confess first. Since both of them are considered ""geniusses""
                  (which when watching this show would make you start doubting the intelligence of the original mangaka) they try to make the other confess using ""elaborate"" ploys which really are not that elaborate at all. Add in the occasional fluffy embarrassed internal girly talk moment or the male equivalent of that in order to get the audience to empathize with the main protagonists and some side characters, particularly Fujiwara, Ishigami, Hayasaka and the Narrator who are actually carrying most of the shows comedic parts and you got your average Romcom anime.
Rest:
Story: Welp basically none
Art: Fair but nothing to be excited about
Sound: Nothing stands out in particular (neither good or bad)
Characters: Fujiwara probably the best character in that show. The rest is as average as they come.
Enjoyment: Welp, not terrible but also nothing which would ever justify the good ratings.
Overall:  It's just another plain average romcom anime with no real redeeming features, plot twists, characters, originality or anything really. It's one of those which makes people fawn over it long enough to write a good review but they will very likely have forgotten within a years time of finishing it.",5

                This is what I call refine of a rom-com series.
The story and how it conveys are really outstanding, it makes my heart race and it makes me laugh. this is what it should be, and it turned out very well and its more than I expected, the art is very good, the OPs and EDs are good especially on EPS3, which is very godlike. the anime had a few and limited characters, but their personalities, the voice actors and their appearance fit them very well. This is one of the Kickstarter pack of the rom-com genre, I really recommend it to everyone. There is only
                  one bad thing about Love is War,

I enjoyed the animation overall it was very pretty in some parts. The music was fun and catching and the way the story is told is very fun. I enjoyed most of the characters but seeing no growth at all pissed me off. It was a enjoyable anime

I couldn't even finish the first episode. the first 20 seconds i was somewhat intrigued but this anime was all over the place. the characters seemed nothing more the pretentious high school A-holes the comedy felt way too forced and the story didn't go anywhere at all in the first episode. it didn't leave me wanting more  i stopped watching 20 mins in and couldn't finish the episode due to how bad this anime was.

                ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am admittedly very torn in regards to how I feel about this series. Is it bad? No. Does it try to be profound? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Would I consider it well-written? I'm afraid not. My definition of ""good"" is loosely ""shines or stands out in one or more aspect whilst upholding an adequate amount of quality in others."" That said, allow me to elaborate on my respective opnions on each of the aforementioned aspects.
The premise and concept of the story is by and large fairly generic; it's a playful banter-like twist on your average slice-of-life/romance/high-school trope wherein the main protagonists are
                  portrayed to be if Light Yagami was essentially a tsundere. That said, though lacking in originality and substance in terms of concept alone, the series does deliver in terms of execution, and more impressively production quality.
One noteworthy aspect of the series, I feel, is its application of monologues and a narrator. Though I personally felt as though the latter was often times overused and , this isn't to say that the voice actor did not deliver; quite the contrary, really. Especially for a comedy gag series, the show does 
Now, the actual ""mind-games"" the overall premise of the show revolves around and two main characters relentlessly subject each other to might turn off those who walked into the anime in search of an actual Death Note rom-com, as it admittedly feels more like a humorous parody of it than anything else. Comically enough, it feels very much like a poorly made fanfiction of said series. Mind you, the show does not actually TRY to be clever; it is very easy to digest and the aforementioned ""mind-games"" which govern the structure of the show itself is more so a comedic tool than anything else.
Due to the relative nature of humour and comedy, I'll attempt to minimise my say on the matter. Though I personally find the formulaic humour the show presents to be a sort of a hit-or-miss, the general consensus seems to think otherwise, and this is perfectly normal. Again, humour is relative, and I think it'd be wise for me to avoid saying any more than this.
More remarkably, I wouldn't be unfaithful to the truth in saying that the anime owes most of its quality to the sheer amount of time and budget invested in it. This is easily the best animated series of this season. That said, it is a notwithstanding easy-to-digest, concept-wise somewhat interesting, and entertaining show that although didn't have anything besides gag comedy tropes to offer, executed it quite exceptionally. Though I can't justify giving this series a score higher than 6/10 for not bringing anything more than comedy gag tropes to the table, it was able to execute them well-enough for the majority of fans and viewers to enjoy, and as such excelled in it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",5
"
                I recommend it if you want something to watch casually and don't care about or like cliche. This is a very standard show, mostly.
[Spoiler warning]
I came to this anime not expecting much, but I still managed to be a little disappointed somehow. In almost every romcom anime, the main couple end the 12-episode arc by not expressing their feelings nor engaging a relationship, but they at least develop themselves more (sometimes). It was not the case here.
The main character, Kaguya, and the ""kaicho"" Shirogane were fun to watch for a while, but their thing of ""I'm too proud to do the first step"" being dragged
                  on until the final episodes was annoying. I was feeling like Ai, Kaguya's maid, tired of that plot, just wanted them to figure it out already. Yes, it's the idea of the show, yes it is used for jokes and hilarious situations during the episodes and I enjoyed that, but it stopped being treated like that during the final 3 episodes.
As the story got more serious, some drama points were added, but they didn't have much impact on the characters. The main couple went through a lot: Meetings, helping each other, solving other people's problems, they even slept together goddamnit, and a major teamwork at the end. They've already shown they like each other, so it's hard to swallow the result. Not only they repress all of their feelings for each other, they also come back to the state they were in the first episode. I mean, what was the point, then?
If it was a full-time comedy and didn't try to be serious, maybe I wouldn't complain. The side characters Chika and Ishigami are great, and they had some good scenes. But I don't get a different vibe from this show in general, it almost doesn't add anything new to the genre and, as I said, it's very standard-type. They spend almost all of their time in the tiny council room, with the same anime school situations we're all familiar with. The disappointing end just messes everything more.
I'd rather watch the anime of Shirogane's friend and his girlfriend, who had like 10 minutes of screen time and managed to get a more interesting relationship than Kaguya and Shirogane in 12 episodes.",6
"
                Noone: 
Shirogane's misrepresentation of Shinomiya in response: *sadistically* ""How Cute.""
Overview: 
This series is not your typical run-of-the-mill rom-com; after all, what's a rom-com. The story features the female protagonist, Student Council Vice President Shinomiya Kaguma and the male deuteragonist Student Council President Shirogane Miyuki's love quarrel; except the part where there's no love progression at all. Kaguya sama introduces a similar aspect to 'Boarding School Juliet' in a way that both male and female main characters can't submit their feelings of love without the other first. That being said, this series spares all the unintentional boob-grabs, panty related cliche events and focuses on the insurmountable
                  ability to conquer each other's love affair in the worst way possible. 
Story: 
Kaguya Sama doesn't focus well on a plot unless you count the ending of each battle/mission to see who comes out victorious (in most ways, it's commonly Shinomiya Kaguma) Each episode features cliche, overused romance/slice of life events in transformative twists (ie; the fireworks scene, where the focus is usually on the couple viewing the fireworks in awe, half an episode is dedicated to the pure effort of being on time together with the student council to watch the fireworks). The story doesn't contribute to an overall structured and meaningful narrative but I'd assume that is Kaguya Sama's strength - It refuses to mould itself within the pre-existing rom-com format. 8/10 
Art & Sound: 
Kaguya Sama spices up the comedic aspect of this series by adding the common exaggerated facial/body expressions but in a semi-serious context. We often see each of the main characters sharing thoughts with an overbearing presence on their faces; this addition to the already-serious voice acting makes Kaguya Sama a rom-com with powerful influence. 8/10 :o
Character: 
Although there were some hinting to character development toward the end (where Shinomiya and Shirogane try to talk to each other after the Summer fireworks) character development did lack quite noticeably in proportion to plot. However, since the character had already been set earlier in the series, the closest to character development for the audience was the use of awkward situations our main characters both got stuck in. Awkward and full of misunderstandings yet worthy of 8/10.
Enjoyment: Hands down 10/10... Haven't had as much fun in a ROM-COM in a while, so it was quite refreshing watching this now. Also, I felt since season 2 was around the corner, it'd be worth catching up on the anime. 3rd anime down (A.I.C.O Incarnation & Kiki's Delivery Service) today so I don't feel inspired to add too much depth in this series review; nonetheless, Kaguya Sama Love is War passes with flying colors!",9
"
                After seeing 3 episodes the anime got me like : -_- , no laughts, no interested, bland caracter, bland plot. The best part about the anime is the openings. I don't why people put this anime at such a high estim while it is : not funny, not enjoyable and the caracters are really unrealistic and unrelatable. The best part about romance anime is that you can make caracters that are realistic enought that you can relate to them, just like in NANA. This anime has none of that. And it's not even funny, Nagatoro, one of the unfunniest anime i have ever seen is
                  a 100 times more funny than love is war. Still don't get the hype arround this mess of an anime.",2
"
                A fun show in the same vein as ""Kare Kano"", However unlike ""Kare Kano"" it doesn't advance the relationship until the end, mostly filling the time with skits. It's more or less a one trick pony, different jokes in the same vein. Personally got stale after a while, and since I already saw a similar show that did more it didn't help. The characters do their jobs, but they're mostly cliches. 
Romantic comedies in similar qualities are pretty common, and by itself there's not much that stands out. There's no fantasy elements like in ""The Devil is a Part Timer"", there's no gimmick to the
                  characters like ""Science Fell in Love.."" or ""Gran Blue"" and the variation of the jokes are pretty non-existent.  For a time-waster there are better ones out there, however it's not like time-wasters are watched for their originality or quality.",3
"
                Kaguya-Sama: Love is War is a rom-com anime but doesn’t have your typical rom-com plot, instead we have two characters that don’t want to confess their love for one another because they are too prideful and think of this as a weakness. In the show, they battle and try to get the other to confess and who ever does first loses. This results in a great comedy anime that I’m really enjoying so far!
This anime is being done by A-1 pictures who either seem to make really good anime or anime that isn’t so good. But so far this one is looking great, at certain
                  points I was laughing out loud, especially during episode 2, when our main ‘couple’, Shirogane and Shinomiya were arguing whether they should go to the mountains or the beach, and episode 4, where everyone could speak french apart from Shirogane. I thought that the funniest part was when Kaguya didn’t know what your ‘first time’ was. I love how overly dramatic and serious the main couple is and it contrasts with the ditzy girl Fujiwara. At moments I found this anime kind of chaotic but not confusing and it just added to the comedy. The story relies quite a lot on the narrator in the earlier episodes, who some people might find a bit annoying, and the internal monologue inside of our characters heads. We know what the characters are thinking but no one else does and they think completely different to how they act, which results in this being a great comedy anime.
A-1 pictures has done a really good job with the animation so far and I really like the character designs as well, my favourite being Shinomiya’s. The characters red and black uniforms looks quite cool and I like the art style as well, even though it looks kind of generic. The opening is great and I feel that you will either love it or hate it and personally l loved it, it doesn’t sound like your average anime opening. I also like the ending and especially the special one in episode 3 with Fujiwara dancing which was really well animated and smooth. I also think the voice acting is great, my favourite being Koga’s voice acting as Shinomiya.
Personally, there isn’t really anything that I can think of that I’m not enjoying about the show, which is very rare. Overall I am really enjoying this anime and so far it is one of my favourites of winter 2019. Start watching it if you haven’t already!",9

                Though the cocept could've been interesting, it fails at giving substance and connection

The two main characters come off as extreamly unlikeble and one more narcissistic than the other
What could've been a relatively nice ""love-war"" between two people who are just too proud and maybe a little embarresed ends up looking like a messed up calculated and manipulative midgame
And overall, this was just so boring, there is nothing in here, not one spark of curiosity, that pushes me to watch the next episode, to want to find out what happens next
              ",1
"
                The episodic formula tends to get tedious in the long run, and it's very unusual to get something that hits all the right notes — making it also difficult to keep it both fresh and unique. Since you need to have a great cast of characters that are likable and has more than enough room for significant development moving forward. Furthermore, the interactions between them should feel natural and mesh well with each other, and in no way give you this sense that it's out of place or inadequately executed. However, everything I noted and more ""Kaguya-sama: Love is War"" surpasses those expectations far above
                  and beyond, and the studio behind it. A-1 Pictures went to every length to make the well-beloved manga which is already fantastic, even better, giving it some extraordinary amount of justice in the process.
Story
It follows Shinomiya Kaguya who is our charming and lovable female lead. She is the vice president of the famous ""Shuchi'in Academy"" where you will find all kind of amusing character, but usually, the more famous people attend this academy having made a name for themselves in the society. For instance, Kaguya is a member of the massively influential ""Shinomiya-Zaibatsu"" and is a multi-talented genius to boot which has no trouble accomplishing anything she sets her mind to, well for the most part. Except, she is in love with our male lead, Shirogane Miyuki. He is someone who worked himself from the ground to the peak and is now considered the top student in this academy. In a matter of wealth, though, he is quite disadvantaged and works many part-time jobs to help his family at home and himself moving forward. You might be asking: ""but what is the goal or plot for this anime?"". Well, both characters are in love with one another, and the purpose is to make the other admit that fact. But, whoever confesses first loses or at least, that's how our main characters see it. In other words, they are too prideful to do it themselves.
Still, I can assure you that just this one ""goal"" can amess forth many hilarious and wholesome situations with our characters in different ways. But you would assume that something so simple would become repetitive very fast. Although instead, it's entertaining all the way through and never lets up. This one of the basis for many things, which makes ""Kaguya-sama"" so unique from other RomCom. On top of that, it's a psychological character driven and relies heavily on our cast. But, mostly it's about Kaguya and Miyuki coming up with all kind of schemes to come out on top of in different situations, and in return leading them every so jointly to confessing their feelings for one another. However, it's not all rainbow and sunshine; the anime can go into some serious and emotional bits which makes it stand out even more, plus making the experience a lot more fulfilling.  
Moreover, It does an excellent job to develop the cast and remeaning a proper balance at the same time. Besides, this anime is more or less for both teenage, and especially the mature audience. Some of the things it throws at you won't make you think otherwise, and the language proves that likewise. Moving on, every single episode also has some nice growth segment for our characters which can come from any situation you can experience in your everyday life. The standard formula is to expand on it and make our cast learn from it in hilarious ways. It never gets old and always feels fresh and new; you really can't help be drawn towards it, despite the fact it's ""episodic"" in its core, it doesn't feel that way either as mentioned above. Plus, If I didn't make it noticeable previously. The comedy is seriously top-notch and never did an episode failed to make me smile or laugh. It's true that comedy is subjective, and it depends on the viewer watching, but I feel like ""Kaguya-sama"" will not fail you regardless of your preference.  As for the pacing, it was spot-on and never did I think the anime was rushing certain events since they used everything viable to them to make the experience magnificent. However, there is more to this, and I will go further in-depth in the ""The Negative"" section of the review.
Art and Animation
The art is lovely and works well with the vibe of the show and never had any flaws, or at least I didn't notice anything significant that stood out. The derp was almost entirely non-existent, and the art always looked terrific and colorful too. A-1 Pictures didn't cut any corners, and it shows how in how much love and care they put in animating this fantastic manga adaptation. Furthermore, they were successfully and accurately able to manipulate the art in any given situation and never failed to make me feel the genuine emotion at a precise time. It is without a doubt one of the best work if not the best for this studio, and after this, I have some profound respect for them and hope they can keep this up for the next anime adaptation they might get their hand on. About animation, for a ""RomCom"" it has very high production value. Some of the scenes, even the minor gets such a massive upgrade and makes for a more meaningful impact. The animator knows what they are doing, it's over the top but just enough make you enjoy yourself and far from producing something that feels wasted.  
Sound
 Nothing but praises regarding this section as well. For starters, the voice actors did an excellent job during their respective roles. This also goes for the side cast and less important characters too.  To give an example, Kaguya's voice actor, Koga Aoi was able to change her voice swiftly depending on her character's mood. And, It didn't feel off in any way. It was spot-on and how quick the change was left me speechless and quite impressed. It could be any mood, ranging from ""anger,"" ""sadness,"" ""happiness"" and the voice actor never ceased to amuse me with her incredible talents. They all deserve a higher wage if you ask me, this is one of the most influential voice actings I have seen in recent year. For the more miscellaneous, like the sound effect, the quality was high and didn't feel cheap. The opening song was immensely addictive. At first, I started with not finding it impressive, but before I knew it, I was humming the whole tune in my sleep. I fell in love with it and still listen to it to this day. The ending song is also beautiful and is an excellent piece to conclude an episode. My favorite would have to be the special one with Chika Fujiwara singing and dancing adorably though. The song was super catchy, and the dance was lovely too. Studio ""Kyoto Animation"" animated this segment and nailed it without a doubt. All said and done, don't get me wrong, I adore every piece of music the anime dished out.
Characters 
The cast is no short of amazing too and didn't feel dull or tiring from start to end. I didn't dislike a single one of them; however, I grew more attached to them as they gained characterization and we learned more of their flaws and charm points. Further, you have both the ""best girl"" and ""best boy"" material alike. No character is wasted and is sufficiently fleshed out, and you can't help but grow genuinely fond of them. It's in someways rare in most media or literature, but ""Kaguya-sama"" has even strong side cast with main role potential. The focus was around them is mild, but what we did get was satisfactory and enough to grow a connection with them. Of course, the character development is also vibrant and realistic in a sense it's slow yet believable, and the pacing is not an issue, at least not to me, and something tells me everyone else who enjoyed this anime would agree. Lastly, you will find all kinds of amusing and quirky character in Kaguya-sama, and every single of them has a distinct and big personality you can't help get drawn toward them.
To give a brief introduction to our beloved cast: 
Outside of the intelligent combo of Kaguya and Miyuki. You have the charming, but at the same time dangerous, Chika Fujiwara, who is more than meets the eye. If you think she is just innocent and precious, you are entirely right. But she can pack a massive blow when you least expect it; she is quite a secret savage in other words. Then you have Hayasaka Ai who is the secretary to Kaguya. Some of her more impactful moments are later down the road, but the anime managed to give her a satisfying introduction. She is a delightful character, who can speak in a charming accent, on top of being adorable and her interactions with Kaguya is entirely wholesome too. She helps her in many situations and is a brilliant wing woman to boot.  Lastly, for this season you have the otaku, Ishigami Yuu with a fragile heart which is ever so slightly socially awkward around other people. But, also like Chika, he's hiding a secret side of his own which you might get to experience now and then if you are lucky. He is my favorite male character in ""Kaguya-sama,"" but Miyuki doesn't fall short either. But you additionally have a very lovable tsundere, Miko Iino, but she will make her debut in season 2. I can tell you this, though. Her interactions with the group, especially Ishigami is some of my favorites. She is also hilarious in many wonderful ways.
The Negative
In my opinion, there was nothing negative about the anime adaptation for ""Kaguya-sama"" which will impact your enjoyment value or anything else of that matter. Although, the order at the chapter was adapted was kind of random in some cases, not counting if it was a mini-arc. That said, this was hardly that big of an issue if anything, you have a lot more to experience in the source material the anime couldn't get to. Also, since it's ""episodic."" The only issue would stem from character development related arc, but to that end, the studio satisfied me, and I couldn't be happier about this adaptation.  
Conclusion
I wholeheartedly recommend this to all fans, including newcomers. It's an excellent gateway into the anime world and shows you just how much fun you can get if you decide to convert over.  It has high re-watch value too, and that's rare in short form. Also, be sure to check out the source material. It's impressive, and one of my favorites manga I am reading at the moment. If you loved the anime, you definitely should, and possible from start and experience everything the anime might've skipped over. It's always lovely to experience two sides of the same coin, you know. Not only that, ""Kaguya-sama: Love is War"" is by itself one of the best anime adaptation to date and far surpasses many you see nowadays. I would urge anyone who loves romance with a slight twist to give this a try, and I can guarantee for many that it won't disappoint. It certainly did not for me, and I had an absolute blast watching this until the end, and I am all game for a sequel and crossing my fingers in anticipating for one.

                Kaguya-Sama manages to accomplish perfectly its view of love as a war. The main idea of the anime is that confessing one's love creates a relationship of submission and thus, defeat. As the two main characters are equally extremely proud teenagers, they get to avoid their honesty and hide their interests in each other while waiting for a confession. At first, this arrogance and passiveness prevented me for relating and caring for them, but it lasted shortly. Both main characters are very expressive by their thoughts, which are represented frequently throughout the scenes, and for the most part are very relatable when it comes to
                  human interaction. This was extremely helpful to deepen the characters personality and create charism. In fact, that's something the anime does perfectly: you end up liking the characters very soon, not only the main two but also the secondary ones. 
The story is purposely simple. Kaguya-Sama is the type of anime that does not have a lot of action going on but surprisingly is very intense in some sequences. It thrives in portraying stuff from our everyday lives as something overly dramatic, creating also very comic scenes. The comedy of the anime really has laughing potential, is well-paced and in the correct dose. It doesn't prevent at all more sensitive scenes to shine. 
The opening and ending are great and so is the soundtrack, which adds a lot to the scenes. The animation and art direction in general is well above average. In the end, Kaguya-sama fulfills everything it proposes to and exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended. Can't wait for a second season!",9
"
                Kaguya is a good show. I will say that, but for me, I did not enjoy it as much as most seem to have. I enjoyed it but did not find it that funny which is one of the shows main pillars so an unfortunate strikeout for me in that department. After that, there was only the story of two tsunderes, Kaguya and Shirogane trying to say they love each other, but their pride holding them both from admitting it. 
There is a decent storyline running through the show which is what kept me watching. The other supporting cast is pretty enjoyable the oblivious airhead
                  Chika, and""always caught in the crossfire"" Ishigami interactions with Kaguya and Shirogane often resulted in humorous moments.
I rather liked the OP very catchy and creative.  
Iffy on if I want to recommend this, but I will give it a cautious thumbs up.",6
"
                Winter 2019 is a nice move for the 2019 anime world. It really is. Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen (Kaguya-sama for short) is definitely in the top 5 best animes of Winter 2019.
 - Story: 8
It sounds simple, and it is simple. Kaguya wants to be confessed. Yeah that's all. Sounds kinda typical, right? But the thing that make the plot outstanding is that - it involves both feelings and funny moments. In fact, in the end of every episode, the last story has many mixed feelings. Funny, and kinda sad, if you ask. That's what make the plot more interesting.
 - Art:
                  10
The art is goddamn gorgeous. They really exceed in designing the characters.
 - Sound: 10
The Chika ending is one of the best ending of Winter 2019, not the best. Wait, did I just state an unpopular fact? The opening (Love Dramatic) is one of the best opening of all time. The outstanding part is that it's a man singing though, not a cute girl. However, in the opposite, the usual ending (Sentimental Crisis) is a girl singing. But it's very, very beautiful. I almost shed my tears when watching the ending. This is probably my first anime that I don't skip the ending and opening.
 - Characters: 8
While the other parts are incredibly great, the characters part is just good. All the characters are great (except Chika the trash meme), especially Kaguya. 
 - Enjoyment: 10
I do enjoy the anime a whole lot. I came from the manga (it was my favourite manga) and I absolutely love it. My favourite manga has been adapted to an anime? Sugoi! 
Overall, I give tihis a 9. One of the best I've ever watched.",9
"
                This was a much hyped series for me but unfortunately disappoints.  Little to no story development, what you see in the first episode is pretty much what you get the whole series through and thus becomes very predictable and boring.  
They set the scene well early on for story and character development but do nothing of the sort and instead repeat the same story line over and over again.  
On the up side the opening and ending themes are great as well as the music throughout the series.
The art and characters designs are good also and doesn't disappoint here either",5
"
                The whole anime was a waste of time, it's amazing how the 2 main characters were able to hide their feelings for so long. I hate the fact that they didn't even confess to each other and I was dying for that to happen. The last episode I was expecting to be more romantic and some sort of confess scene under the fireworks and a kiss. BUT NO THAT DID NOT HAPPEN,
that is what triggered me the most while waiting for something good to at least happen throughout the season.
When I first watched it I thought, 'wow this anime is probably gonna have some nice
                  romantic stuff going on here just like any other anime'
One thing I actually liked about this anime was that you can actually know the thoughts of the 2 characters and how their feelings towards each other affect them, a lot more stuff could have happened which could have made the anime better but I appreciate the person who thought out this anime and made this show, I like the modern time and the art that brings out that bling in the anime.
Edit 2021: Forget I ever made this review lmao",6
"
                Season 1 and just a comedy show.
Turning my brain off is the only way I am able to watch it.
It's not even funny.
Story is written very badly. or in this case; very average. mostly boring. = 3/10
Art very average 4/10
Sound kind of ok = 5/10
Character = Ok 4/10
I won't spend a cent for this anime.
That.s how bad it is. Not worth the money.
Is a great starter anime for noops though.
newby will easily find this anime fun to watch as it is easy to understand. Very easy to understand, if they can't understand; probably had some serious problem on the education ends.
This anime does teach some values, but are mostly crooked. Don't try similar things if you go to japan unless you want to be an actors.
Then again, this is something like for fantasy. This anime do not need you to be a litter good in intelligence at all. You can be a kid of 3 years old and will still enjoy it.
basically, the anime is easy to understand. good for beginners.",3
"
                This anime had everything... love, war, and everything in between those two things. This anime reminded me of the classic American film Mr. and Mrs. Smith starring Angelina Jolie and Jack Black. In it J-Lo and Jack play 2 spies that are married but at the same time they dont know the other one is a spy. In the movie at a certain time they find out the other one is a spy and they have a big fight. But instead of going for his belt like my Dad usually did, Jolie and Black go for their rocket launchers and they start shooting eachother like
                  it's dessert storm. At the end of the movie Love wins and they hug eachother and even kiss. This is a lot like this anime show. But instead of rocket launchers Miyuki and Kaguya shoot smartness bombs at eachother. The whole season is a stale mate, with each character internal monologuing 90% of the time. This show is so good you could miss whole chunks of episodes and the plot would still be in the same place from when you left off. I tested this theory by watching the whole season again, this time starting at episode 12 and then 11 and then 10 and then 9 and then 8 and then 7 and then 6 and then 5 and then 4 and then 3 and then 2 and then 1. It was even better the second time around. My favorite character on the show is Chika. She has a very kawaii dance in the show which I found on youtube.com and I watched for 10 hours straight one night, only masturbating twice the whole time. All in all if you've ever felt like love is war this show is for you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJyIR0Z-LhE",9

                Rom-coms are a dime a dozen these days, and many of them stumble with predictable soap-opera narratives, thinly written characters, or other issues that bore or irritate viewers. Refreshingly enough, this is not the case with Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which avoids these pratfalls and combines a humorous and cleverly written script with a likable cast of characters to provide consistently engaging and amusing scenarios.
The cast of characters is small, but likable and very well-developed. Our protagonists, Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane, are presidents of the student council at an elite academy. The series’ premise is that both of them have crushes on each other,
                  but of course, neither wants to be the one to confess first, and they resort to playing mind games with one another around simple things, trying to convince the other to reveal their crush. On occasion, supporting council members Chika Fujiwara and Yu Ishigami inadvertently foil their strategies.
As is standard with many comedy series, episodes are divided into three sections, and each features a sketch that usually involves Kaguya or Shirogane devising a plan to get the other to do something. The variety of absurd ways they manipulate each other are consistently funny and well-paced, and nothing ever feels repetitive. The series’ sketch-based structure allows the series to remain interesting and fresh while giving the viewer a look into the inner workings of the way our main characters view each other, and every situation develops them as characters by revealing a handful of their strengths, weaknesses, and traits.
The animation is vivid, featuring colorful and well-defined characters and backgrounds, and the voice actors give excellent performances, allowing the characters to be relatable and expressive. The soundtrack was of good quality, and I especially liked the opening theme, “Love Dramatic.” 
Overall, Kaguya-sama is a truly outstanding series. By circumventing tired romantic clichés in favor of perfectly paced comedy with a psychological twist, it provides a refreshing take on the genre that comes highly recommended to anyone looking for amusing and well-written entertainment.

"
                Death Note and Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san had a baby, and it somehow grew up to be the best romance anime in years.
When I first began Kaguya-sama, I wasn’t sure what to make of it. It certainly was different than any high school romcom I’ve come across. Just the fact it was immediately clear both leads liked each other differentiates it from its peers. Not only that, but they’re each almost certain the other reciprocates their feelings. Sounds like a pretty straightforward solution: one of them confesses and they start dating. Right? Not so fast my friend.
The story largely revolves around Miyuki and Kaguya, the
                  president and vice president of the student council, respectively. Given their social standing, intelligence, and looks, they are both quite popular with the opposite sex, yet they really only have eyes for the other. Oh, and one other important piece of information: they may be the two most stubborn, and prideful, human beings on planet Earth. You see, while they would each very much like to be in a relationship with the other, they would like the other to be the one to confess first. If you’re thinking, “they can’t possibly make a show out of two people trying to get the other to confess”, you would be wrong. Some of their mind games and schemes to get the other to confess, as well as their imagination of how these might come to fruition, is almost always hysterical. I’d also like to point out some of the character development for Kaguya in particular. Her character makes real strides throughout the season as we learn a bit more about her background in the latter parts.
And then there’s Chika, the secretary of the student council. She is a little bit of an airhead and is blissfully unaware of all the mental warfare happening between the president and vice president. This obliviousness often throws a wrench in the leads' plans in hilarious fashion. But what she lacks in I.Q. (at least compared to Miyuki and Kaguya), she makes up in pure charm. Some of the most memorable moments were just Chika being Chika. I’m not saying she’s the deepest, most well-written character ever created, but it you dislike her, you might just be dead inside, or you just haven’t seen “the dance”. But to quote the late great Billy Mays, “but wait, there’s more!’. Apparently the student council had a treasurer that somehow stayed hidden for a decent chunk of the first season. Enter Yuu Ishigami, the character I’ve heard some people refer to as “our guy” because of how (often times painfully) relatable he is. His addition immediately paid dividends. While he is more aware of the absurdities happening around him than Chika, he clearly wants no part of anything that is happening. He’d much rather be playing the latest game release or watching his favorite anime. Did I say relatable?
The art might not blow you away consistently, but if I were ranking anime based solely on the characters’ facial expressions, this would be near the top. The animation is definitely different than most of its counterparts. It’s not quite Shaft-level of odd, but it definitely adds to the quirkiness of the show.
Onto sound. Where do I even begin with the voice acting? Everyone, take bow. Top-to-bottom, this is some of the finest comedic voice acting I’ve heard in anime. If I had to pick a favorite, it’d probably be Konomi Kohara as the zany Chika. And of course, how can you not mention “Love is War”, one of those OPs I would place firmly into the ""unskippable"" category. Shout out to the narrator too, whose droll commentary on the war usually added to the comedy.
If you couldn’t tell, I thoroughly enjoyed Kaguya-Sama: Love is War. The characters are insanely lovable, their chemistry and interactions are fantastic, and it manages to be one of the funniest series I’ve seen while also having some real heartfelt moments, particularly later in the season. Unless you have something against smiling, watch this show, and pray to the anime Gods we get a second season.",9

the exact time of me writing this review
after watching the last episode, i'm not sure if everyone felt the same thing as i am but truthfully, i'm filled with mixed feelings of happiness, sorrow.
before that, let me explain this series in a bigger picture.
kaguya sama is just a normal romantic comedy, we have 2 main characters who is naive in their own way. im not saying this is a bad thing. in fact, their naiveness of love is what makes this anime worth watching. it takes me back to my high school life where love life is such a beautiful thing.
                  as i watch both of the mc doing their best to have their crush love them back, it really makes me feel happy and sad at the same time. im happy because i get to see their hilarious everyday life as they encounter each other, but at the same time i felt sorrow because it REALLY takes me back to high school life. to be honest, reminiscing high school life is a pain. i just can't get over the fact that the best time of my life is over. the care-free life and seeing all friends in the same place is such a beautiful memory.
welp, enough with that, lets get right to the point.
like i said, kaguya sama is just a normal rom-com. but what really makes me love this anime is their comedic narratives. here we have some kind of moderator who explains everything in such a hilarious way, we have funny everyday skits thats full of surprises, we have the other 2 mc who makes everything even more hilarious and many more. i don't know if im just having lack of research materials but i feel like this is the only anime that has done something like this. in the end, kaguya sama is funny in it's own way.
[SPOILER FREE] this paragraph is something that doesn't really need to be here but i just feel like i should write something about the ending.i watch this anime just for fun, nothing serious, just to have a relaxing time on the couch. but seeing how they concluded the anime is just amazing. i was smiling on my own and damn wasn't expecting to feel this way with this kind of anime. i just can't think of a better ending than what we got, it was perfect. with that, my post-anime depression is back.

"
                kaguya sama: love is war .. my god what a show that was.
i must say  was hooked once i read the synopsis and saw the trailer but god did the show surpassed my expectation by a landscape.
story: the stroy is quite simple .. actually as it is it's basically a standard rom com show .. two in love with each other .. a supporting cast that pushes thing around them to get the flow going .. a highschool setting. what's intruiging is how the charatcers are actually how this show differs from others .. we have two genuises dueling it out to make the
                  other confess .. but despite how smart and how elaborate thier plans are the end result always goes to show how naive (to not say dumb) they seem when the are using their intellegence in a domain they know noghting of.
we get these 3 parts per episode mini stories which are hillarious and entertaining as hell and from time to time we get few hints here and there about the backstory of the characters and what made them the way they are .. the sick kaguya epsiode showed the shinomiya family idoelogie and why kaguya is so aggressive with expressing feelings .. then the 2 last episodes show us how different kaguya is from her family .. and how her friends changed her back inot a human being unlike the rest of the shinomiya. and honestly i never expected a comedy to break my heart the way this show did .. i can't praise enough the stroy of kaguya sama.
art/animation: perfect 10 (would give more if i could) 
THIS IS HOW AN ANIMATION COMPANY FLEXES ON THE COMPETITION .. THEY MAKE THE 2ND ED.. seriously that ED was better animated than most good action series .. that ED alone puts everything the likes of pierrot make to shame and IT WAS SHOWN FOR ONCE ONLY.. well now that i'm done with the ED i can freely talk about the rest of the series..
the rest was no less quality than the ED tbh .. the CGI was on of the best uses of CGi in any show .. the character movements . the extreme over the top reactions were so good and the cut scenes along with the amazing visual effecrts made were splendid even tho the show didn't need any of them .. they enhanced it to even higher level by using them .. the show didn't get to feel boring .. nothing kept stall or unmoving .. the dynamic was great .. the camera movements were on point .. the is how animation is done .. A1 this is how you make an anime.. the other aspect is the art .. the art was top notch .. the backgrounds looks goreous and the cut scenes were good looking and well drown .. the faces of the characters were priceless and delivered every drop of feeling they were meant to deliver . bravo
characters: 10
what can i say .. in my mind a tsundere is not a physically violant character .. a tsundere is a character that can't understand their feeling and as such they tend to respond violently ..again not physically altho physical abuse has its own merits in comedy as we saw with the chika hitting ichigami scene..those two main characters .. both were the perfect example of tsundereand it was helarious .. that aside both of them weren't just bland characters to the point you sum them up by calling them tsuns .. kaguya seemed to be like a machine throughout her life .. and after seeing her family mato you can tell that it's because the shinomiya family doesn't allow weakness .. no feelings at all .. never feel mercy .. never feel regret . never feel love .. and after getting to know the outside people that changed ... what makes her a tsundere isn't a generic character trait .. it's that clash between her famely's ideology fight off her new feelings and personality.. miyuki on the other hand is a guy with huge ambitions and armed with hard work .. he made his hardd work pay off and joined a prestigous academy .. and despite being new his hard work made him take the title of students council president .. but despite that he's a regular person with feelings like anyone else and after spending time with a cold hearted kaguya who by the time became a sweet person ( with agressive tendencies) he fell for her yet still is worry of her at the same time .. and that's the conflict that is making him out to seem tsundere .. but this show has other character .. characters that despite being supportive they are actually more important than our main duo themselves.. chika, ichigami and hayasaka (along with others) .. i am still conflicted between hayasaka and chika as to which is this anime's best girl and man is it a hard show .. and ichigami is such a relatable character you can't not sympethize with him .. those three create such an amazing dynamic .. and these three are what made this show to what it is.
in the end .. i must say ... there was no episode of this show that i didn't watch less than 5 times .. and by god in none of these time sdid the the show fail to make me laugh.. i watched alot of comedy .. and i enjoyed alot of them .. but i can confidently say that this show competes with the best of them.. and i'm glad i had this show to lighten up my days. and so i say i give this show a total rating of 9.5/10 .",9
"
                Story: The  core elements of the story, being mainly the social interactions between members of the seitokai, are the usual recipe to slice of life/comedy anime, as people that watched seitokai yakuindomo would know very much. Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai follows that pattern and purpose, but excels in the execution. It does so by adding romance and mind games in a rather clever way that makes the viewer cheer and support the main characters on their goals of surrendering the other one. The background story of the characters is also very well made and make us empathize with them. Each one has their struggles and
                  sufferings. The only thing I criticize about the story is also one of the motivations it won a 10 for enjoyment for me, and it is that ""capitularized"", ""short-story divided"" way that the story is told to the viewer. Separating it in individual small funny situations kind of forecloses the development of the story and also the personal maturation of the characters. It is made that way so you can watch a single episode alone and laugh at it, and appreciate it. I understand. But it's kind of frustrating that the Shirogane Miyuki from 9th episode is almost not different from the Shirogane Miyuki from the 1st episode. I realize that 12 episodes may be too less to show some decent development, but comparing the first season of OreImo ( a show I really like ), the show made me laugh but also shown deep maturing of the characters, a substancial development. I missed a little bit of it.
Art: The art is sensational. A person that have watched many animes can see that staff has put some good effort in it. For a short comedy anime like this, it shows that the staff itself has felt in love with the anime, and was having fun producing it. They put a lot of attention to the minimal details, not only concerning to art, but sound and direction too. The diference in design and style from the mainstream 2010s anime art is very noticeable. the shape of the face, the illumination on the eyes... everything feels original and exclusive. The smoothness of the animation, how the frames flow.. even though it isn't a action anime, the animators didn't spared frames. 
Sound: From the opening theme to the ending theme, going through the whole soundtrack, there is not a single time that the viewer will not feel immersed in the flow of storytelling. Talking about storytelling, the storyteller has a deep importance in the whole experience of watching this anime. without him, it wouldn't be as funny and as interesting. The use of this narrating tool helps placing us on a third person spectator viewpoint, giving some distancing from the situation, allowing us to laugh of their misery without emotionally getting too involved in a way we would not laugh as much. 
Character: the characters are perfect: a diligent poor guy, a rich naive former-emotionless woman, a child minded retarded girl and a antisocial (probably channer) otaku. Each one has it's own background, except from chika. She just existis to make shirogane and shinomiya plans go wrong. The joker factor. That is really important in the context of mind games and very well calculated schemes, because her stupidity brings the random factor back to the game. The show itself admits that whole of unpredictability that she has. 
Enjoyment: It made me laugh a lot. that's the only thing that's needed to say. 
overall: I recommend it for everyone. There are many cases when the anime is not very good, so you have to think about a group of people that may like it. But that's not the case of Kaguya-sama. Everyone can watch it and appreciate it.",9

                Non-spoiler review.
In the mere 12 episodes this anime had, each one was hilarious. To start with, the opening theme is one of the must watch. Extremely catchy James Bond-esque sound. Each episode had 2 or 3 stories inside. The narrator really added to the enjoyment at the end of each story. The overall story was the constant battle between Kaguya and Miyuki to make the other fall in love first. The hilarity made me laugh so hard at times I had tears. I really liked the art style and sound usage throughout. Character-wise, I loved Chika. She really steals the main characters thunder in a
                  lot of the episodes. If you are looking for a really good RomCom, this is it! Here's hoping for another season!",10
"
                I can’t tell you how many times I’ve said over and over “Watch Kaguya-sama: Love is War”. I’ve been shoving it down people’s throats including nonanime watchers, jokingly of course. I knew from the start that it was going to be something fun to watch but I didn’t expect myself to be so immersed in it.
Kaguya Shinomiya is the smart and talented vice president of the student council of the prestigious Shuchiin Academy and from the wealthy Shinomiya family. On the other hand, you have Miyuki Shirogane, the poor but hardworking president of the student council who uses his incredible work ethic to achieve his
                  goals. To everyone’s eyes, they seem like the perfect couple but they’re actually not dating. These two high school geniuses are too stubborn to admit how they feel about each other so they play these ludicrous mind games to try and win a confession from the other. It’s sort of like an episode of Tom and Jerry or Looney Tunes but in the form of high school relationships. It’s over the top and ridiculous but that’s what’s so great about it.
Every episode is exuberant, and it never feels mundane. It’s implausible to think that most of the action happens in just one single room. Each episode focuses on Kaguya and Shirogane mapping out these various schemes in their heads to come out on top in certain situations, essentially leading them one step closer to having the other one confess their feelings. It’s psychological warfare between the two with everything at stake for them. Except, there’s actually nothing at stake here. When you look at things more carefully you realize that if one of them simply admitted their feelings to the other,  then this crazy situation would be over. But what would be the fun in that? When you take out the narration and context as to what is happening in the head of these two students, it becomes clear as to how ridiculous the entire situation is. To think that the top two students of Shuchiin behave like fools is hilarious.
Although watching two people mentally battle it out is amusing, the reason for their “War” is deeper than it may seem. Kaguya and Shirogane are both prideful and believe confessing to the other is a sign of weakness and submission. But honestly, it seems as if they're both afraid about how the other person might respond and how it might affect their relationship. What if the response is negative? Will they be able to stay friends? When you look at things from this perspective, you begin to understand and relate to their feelings. We've all felt like this before. Their actions may not be as crazy as they seem.
I expected 12 episodes of over the top comedic battles but I was surprised when it suddenly got serious. The latter half of the anime did an excellent job in balancing out the goofy and serious tone. Kaguya: Love is War isn't just some average rom-com. It can get real and emotional and that's what makes it stand out even more.
 Our characters are intriguing and vibrant, and their interactions are dynamic. You begin to understand the characters more as each episode progresses.  Kaguya may seem cold and distant to everyone around her but her friends know she’s a sweet person. Yet they don’t know that she often looks down on them (Chika) which make for some pretty funny moments. Shirogane is hardworking but he’s also a caring person who puts others before himself. Chika Fujiwara is the cheerful and naïve secretary who prances around the student council room not knowing what’s happening between the two protagonists and as a result, she intervenes in their schemes and throws things out of loop for better or worse. Yuu Ishigami, the pessimistic treasurer, can read the situations more clearly but is still pretty clueless as to what is going on. He may seem shy and awkward but when he speaks, he’s honest and straightforward and sometimes comes off as just harsh. This leads to situations in which he unintentionally says something rude or hurtful which results in hilarious scenarios. Ai Hayasaka is Kaguya’s personal maid, but their relationship is that of sisters. She’s the more reasonable one of them all. She is loyal to Kaguya and does her bidding but also encourages Kaguya to be more sincere with her feelings. As a whole, they’re puzzle pieces that fit perfectly together. I was always excited to see these characters interact with one another and curious as to how they’ll surprise me this time. And then when a new character came into the mix, I’d be thrilled and think How will this one change things up? They're a great cast full of chemistry.
There’s nothing more that can be said about the animation and art style. I found it to be clean and smooth. Well done indeed. For a romantic comedy they really did invest a lot into the art and animation and I’m glad they did. Episode 3’s ED pretty much confirmed this. The VA’s did an incredible job bringing out the emotion of each character and have them come to life. Like everything else, the music was top tier. The OST played in each scene fit perfectly making everything more dramatic and impactful. The OP and ED are so good that I found myself bumping to both even when I wasn't watching the anime (wish I could I find them on Apple Music). 
The worst part about Kaguya-sama: Love is War? The fact that it was only 12 EPISODES. Also, the fact that the Chika ED was only ever used once. Such a shame. Honestly, though, I really can’t say anything bad about this anime. I loved it from start to finish. I will say this though if you want a more in-depth look at the story and its characters, read the manga. The anime did gloss over some chapters – one of those chapters being my favorite – so do check it out if you want something extra.
I said it before, and I’ll say it again. WATCH KAGUYA-SAMA: LOVE IS WAR. Or read it. Both are incredible either way. It’s hilarious, emotional, witty, etc. What I expected to be a funny rom-com with redundant clichés we’ve seen, turned out to be one of my all time favorite animes. I deeply encourage you to watch it. It may not be for everyone but I’m sure if you watch it, chances are that you’ll enjoy too.",9
"
                Rom-Com was not my fav type of genre except the one I interest,like Monogatari series or some in mood, But this is by far one of the best School life romance out there, only brainlets would think this is generic funny wholesome rom-com or something along those
Story: Well, at first, I was thought this is a rom-com with funny adult jokes that centered on school life, but after a rewatch, I was wrong, This is death note, Death note is one of the first 3 series I watch and it's highly entertaining in the 1st half, Both people using their brain to kill each other,
                  and one to find out the killer, which was his friend all along, with sus meter so everyone won't notice you're the killer or captured due to sus or something along those lines, In Love is war, that's not the case, you See both couple Miyuki and Kaguya Trying to confess each other, with dumb ways and fun adult jokes, so maybe you guys wouldn't notice it, I recommend when these couples closer each other, turn your brain on, you will see who will confess to them first, with sneak and stealth feeling in their heart, Show your skill to make her/him confess, Or Seduce him/Her to confess to you, And the Humor never feel too crushing
""But how's Love is war a psychological but it almost had no dark theme or it's was a comedy?""
Because Death note mainly uses Jungian psychology or Jungian analysis, as Stated in Wikipedia:
""Jungian Analysis, as is psychoanalysis, is a method to access, experience, and integrate unconscious material into awareness. It is a search for the meaning of behaviors, feelings, and events. Many are the channels to extend knowledge of the self: the analysis of dreams is one important avenue.""
The Art in Love Is war is Excellently directed and colorfully shot and fluid, Nice Blend of rotoscoping, A-1 Pictures is always my dope since they sometimes make a good-great show or maybe even worse, like ao no exorcist,franxx, and even sao, But this is the greatest Animation By A-1 that not disappoint the watcher or A-1 didn't Dissapoint, since animation traded with mid-story or something like that, The art reminds me of shaft, One of my favorite studios
Sound pretty much I don't care, nothing special and forgettable, really, due to the fluid art
Characters are By Far the best part, They use brains and mind to make one of these student councils confess, Miyuki And Kaguya, And other  Characters, who given a backstory or Side characters but they can make a huge impact on the confession they planned, Chika the annoying girl who can make a kiss or make both of the student councils kiss or confess by leaving one of them unguarded their heart and suddenly confesses, Ishigami the Helper, and more ways.
Enjoyment: Laughs, Wholesomeness, Cliffhangers from Seduction and intense scene about the one who will confess first, What do You want? Go Pick this up
Message: If you consider Love is war a solid generic funny rom-com then f**k you, Go rewatch konosuba/Mr bean instead and get a life
Thanks For Reading!",9

                "" Love isn't complicated, people are. "" - Lovely Goyal
Love is War depicts an unusual love story of a diligent male president with resourceful and rich female vice president of Student Council. They perceive love as a war and devised many strategies and physiological tricks to hide their own feelings and to make each other the first person to confess. They are both smart and hold dear to their pride, not willing to concede to their true feelings that is hidden behind their cunning and elaborate schemes which makes then overthink most of the time but it's this silliness that steals the audience's heart. And
                  hence, they set this whole romantic war-like-game afoot. 
Oh, how cute.
And then there's Chika, the secretary that is labelled as the best girl in the season with her dance and her memes. She is the innocent girl that becomes the element of chaos to their flawless plan with her causal actions and remarks. She is the cute addition in this complicated war of human's mind. There's also Ishigami, the treasurer that incidentally caught in this mess, he is simply a depressing guy that is straightforward with his feelings with a gloomy mindset and all he wishes is just to not die.
Story part aside, Love is War is such a charm because of the hilarious yet serious facial expressions of the characters in the trivial moments and the unsung voice actors behind them that match their ridiculous dialogues perfectly with the expressions. They managed to portray the insights of the characters well given each awkward situation and to bury the embarrassment behind the characters' smirk while fantasizing. One thing about the employed humour, is not what the content is about but how the voice actors convey it and they did a great job at that, fully utilising the personality of their characters.
Another engagement in the entertaining value is the comments from the narrator that sounds like he's doing real live explanation of a MMA fight, interpreting the emotional change of characters and making the scenes more dramatic than ever. The real deal is when his voice heightened with disbelief for every suspense that just steals the spotlight and increase the comedic value even more.
This is also when the arts of A-1 Pictures and the unique directing style comes into the play. The studio managed to create many attractive scenes with the camera work to keep the story from being dull even if most of the conversation takes place in a single room. The visual effects, and the sound effects casually slip into the clichéd romance and depicts the feelings that you would resonate with. The OSTs, although are average but it sums up as a merit point and blend well with the animation. You've got a retro and funky opening with the old classics spy style that depicts the romantic 'battle' of the brains and the soothing ending that seems to be a dream for the rich girl, Kaguya to escape in.
Overall, Love is War is not perfect, it has its flaws that the episodic story might get repetitive sometimes. However, the pros outweigh them and it is entertaining nonetheless to see a different level of phycological anime with a spice of romcom that preys on how sophisticated a simple love can be made to be. 
A coming-of-age romcom that tickle everyone's bone with the silliness and warm the heart with cuteness and romance.",9

                Short Spoiler Free Review:
Damn... I personally have never been a fan of ""Romance"" / ""School"" themed animes, but this one just blew my mind. It is so UNIQUE and I love it exactly for that reason. 
The comedy balanced with the perfect story are on point. I dont remember the last time a ""Comedy"" anime has actually managed to make me smile, but every episode of this anime has managed to do exactly that, and even in occasions, make me giggle out loud. The entire storyline script is just absolutly perfect. I love the narrator and I love the story! <3
The Art is also so
                  bloody great! All the characters are so damn cute! The animations and movement are also done so damn well! I LOVE IT! The second ending (with Chika) is also without a doubt not one of the best, but THE BEST ED (Animation wise) that I have ever seen! It's incredible!  
The sound is also outstanding, not just on the OP and ED (which is also amazing btw), but the sound effects and voice acting are phenomenal! The soundtrack is just perfect! (Constant eargasm guaranteed).
The Characters are also so bloody well made! They are all so fucking cute and I have an interest for all of them (Chika is the one and only best grill btw <3). ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Overall, Im giving this anime a solid 10/10. Even if you dont enjoy Romance or School genere animes, this one is different and it is genuinely great and funny! I have a feeling I will remember this anime for a long time and that it will always have a special place in my heart! <3",10

                Are you looking for a completely over-the top rom-com with great characters, a unique premise, and absolutely phenomenal voice acting? Well then look no further than Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen! Kaguya- sama was, in my opinion, the most enjoyable anime to air in the Winter 2019 season. It had it's flaws and may not be for everyone, but it was definitely a great ride.
Story:
The basic plot of Kaguya-sama is that two elite student council members, Shinomiya Kaguya and Shirogane Miyuki, fall in love with each other. However, both of them are too proud to admit it, so they engage in a series
                  of battles of wits where they each try to get their opponent to confess. They each have their own way of approaching these battles, but both of them go completely over-the-top while trying to wean a confession out of the other. Round of this plot device with the art and voice acting (more to come on those later) and you get something very unique among a ton of other standard rom-coms that you can't stop laughing at.
Art and Sound:
I'm going to include these two categories together, because in many scenes both of these attributes quite literally make the show. The art style is very consistent and of high quality (especially the second ed in episode 3). Many of the intense ""battle"" scenes are complemented by exaggerated visuals that really add to the dynamic of the struggle between the two main characters. But this is where the sound comes in as well. While the sound direction in terms of the OST is relatively standard, the voice actors knock every scene out of the park. I was consistently amazed by the voice actor's performances, especially Aoi Koga as Kaguya. And the narrator... He brings an intensity to every scene that makes even the most trivial activities feel like a fight to the death. All in all, the execution of the art and sound take Kaguya-sama's humor to another level, and really make it enjoyable to watch.
Character:
Kaguya's characters all have a defined roll in the show, but as plots are executed you learn more about their personalities and backstories. Overall, each one of the characters is lovable and well written, and each is character and role is truly irreplaceable.
Enjoyment:
This is another area where Kaguya-sama stood out above all else (at least for me). While some people who REALLY don't like over-the-top, exaggerated humor may not enjoy Kaguya, it was a show that had me laughing out loud every episode, which is something no other anime has been able to make me do for years. If you are looking for a light hearted, romcom that is just a blast to watch, I really don't think you could find any better than Kaguya-sama. 
Overall:
You're still reading this review? ""O kawaii koto."" But in all seriousness, what are you waiting for? If you've made it this far and still have even the slightest interest in the show, go and give it a watch. It's a great ride, and if you follow the three episode rule and still don't enjoy it, then at least you'll know where that one anime dance that took the internet by storm came from.",10
"
                ""If Death Note was a Rom-com it would have been this.""
Everyone's saying this line and it is quite accurate. 
Kaguya-sama is one of those Rom-com anime that you just have to watch, it indulges you with weekly laughs and provides you that grinning face for 24 minutes and as an avid fan of the manga i am quite happy that everyone's having a great time with the anime too.
I love everything about this anime, its style, the sound, the characters, and the directors who are just being so good at their job. It's pretty fair to say that Kaguya-sama is a decent anime to start
                  with for Winter of 2019.
The Pros of this anime:
- great characters (although this is pretty debatable as i have seen over on the internet)
-it gives you them smiles.
-its a wholesome anime.
-chika dance and more
Cons:
-you'll pretty much be wanting more if you enjoyed it and it is quite unhealthy.
-even though i loved the characters, some characters are just for the laughs and not really for the ""plot"" 
-it kinda skipped a few chapters (but i think its for the better.)
-sometimes it gets too cliche 
Overall though, i think this anime is for everybody who just wants laughs, it isnt for everybody i know but im sure even those who dislike the cliches etc would still love it. 
oh you're still reading this review?

                Oh how much I loved Kaguya-sama(I mean the show :P)
All of us have watched many high school anime. A guy, a girl, some romance, one confesses to the other and a happy end.
Well, that's not the case here.
The show is a brilliant battle of wits between Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane. For those who have watched, the mind battles between Kaguya and Miyuki were on the level of Light and L from Death Note.
While both the characters are brilliant themselves, it is quite funny to see what big Tsunderes they are when they are actually confronting each other. This show takes the level of personal
                  ego to a whole new dimension. 
Each episode is divided into three instances, and boy are they funny. To complement our characters, are Chika Fujiwara and Ishigami. One main thing that somehow manages to make me dislike anime is the less involvement of side characters or focus on just two main people. However, this show does not suffer from this flaw. Whenever something tense or cute is going to happen, Chika will be there or Ishigami will be there to sound creepy and go on and on.
Intensely Cute - if there was something I would use to describe the show, it would be intensely cute. While there is a brilliant battle of wits going between Kaguya and Miyuki, there are so many cute moments that they both have. And believe me, if you are having a hard day, just see Chika's smile or that famous dance of this show(I am pretty sure everyone knows about that by now) and all your worries will go away. I would also like to say that the narrator does an equally good job in keeping the intensity and explanation of the scenes on the right track which I have never seen.
The art of the show is pretty standard, but boy when there is a tense(battle of wits) or a cute moment, the art shows its true colors. For the sound, I would say all the soundtracks for the show that is the background music really fit the corresponding scene. Also, while the opening song is like a declaration of war between the two, the ending song is a peaceful melody that reminds us how much they both love each other.
This show was my favourite show of the season alongside Mob Psycho(Season 2).
I would recommend everyone to watch this show.
Hope you found this review helpful :)",9
"
                Confessing our love to someone is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges we could ever face in our lives. 
""O Kawaii Koto~""
This Anime is A Battle of Wits and Egos. but what kind of battle is it? is it for Money? or for Status? The answer is love, they battled upon who would confess first. Both know know they like each other but whomever confess first might ruin their pride or they might even be laughed at, they battle about this everyday using their wits, The depth to this anime is soooo deep! This is one of the qualities That makes this Anime so good.
This
                  is definitely one of those special animes that represent why I’ve been watching anime for so long. The anime is true to it’s title and it definitely lives up to its name “Love is War”. Shirogane and Kaguya appear to be the perfect couple, but both are too proud to confess their love. They “scheme” to make the other confess first. Which then makes it a war. I’ve seen plenty of romantic comedy anime’s but never before have I seen such a series like this one
The voice actors played a big role in bringing out the character's personality. the narrator played a big part in setting tone and mood. The character's are easily likable and cute, with their set of unique qualities that defines them and sets them apart. The soundtrack such as the op Love Dramatic by Masayuki Suzuki was really good. He is honestly quite underrated.
Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen is one of the funniest and most well-directed shows I have seen in a long time. The concept of confessing is a beautiful thing. In anime when you see 2 people make such a cute couple it’s annoying especially when all you want to see is a confession yet it doesn’t happen. I’m sure you guys know what I’m talkin about... However, the cast, comedy, and art is more than enough to make up for the annoyance. Nearly every singe part and episode build up perfectly until, the climax of the story. Overall I really enjoyed watching it! This is definitely an anime I would recommend to you! And other people (＞人＜;) 10/10 MASTERPIECE",10
"
                The first season is nothing short of perfection, I just can't praise this series enough. I was genuinely fond of the the main characters, and their interactions together are truly adorable. The development of their ""relationship"" was very natural even though it follows a formulaic pattern upon every episode, I never find it annoying, in fact it is one of the things that makes me feel drawn towards the series even more. The narrative and psychological aspect was amazing as well.
One of the things which stood out most in my opinion is the narration, it was beyond legendary as well as the voice acting, along
                  with the outstanding music and soundtrack. I firmly believe these were only few of the many reasons why this series was a success.
The first season had a very consistent pacing, they introduced casts in a creative way and doesn't feel dragged, they also gave justification on these side characters by providing insights of their personality and personal background in a manner that doesn't feel forced. Another notable thing to mention was that the series DOES NOT have a weak arc and/or episode, you will find each and every episode as equally enjoyable as the other.
There are many positive things to mention about this series, every aspect and elements had no glaring flaw therefore I understand where all these hype is coming from. As long as this season doesn't fall flat of the standard that the first season has set, we're up for another exciting season.",10

                Want to watch two Elitists participate in a psychological warfare? Do you like the occasional flat chest jokes? Or prehaps you just want to see THE best dance choreography in all of anime for yourself? (22:30 Ep 3.) Kaguya-sama: Love is war! or simply 'Kaguya-sama' for the sake of the review, is a rom-com that exaggerates the psychological aspects of teenage crushes. 'Kaguya-sama' delivers it's success through the use of episodic skits throughout the series, so if you are looking for an anime that delivers in-depth storytelling and obsessive amounts of character development, you're not gonna find it here. 
Kaguya-sama is THE ONLY anime ever
                  to feature 80% of the show in a single location and keep the audience entertained for the entirety of the duration. This is possible because of two major factors,  cinematic techniques and characterization, the conflicts and interaction between characters pair up perfectly and I dare to say PERFECTLY with the camera work. The use of shadowing & coloring to appeal to emotion are complimented and heavily emphasized through the frequent zooms and spectator angles, to the point where the average human grammar is unable to capture the true essence of it's beauty and it can only be summed up as 'Art!' (except it's not an explosion).
Aesthetically, I believe A-1 did a splendid job with the art style because of how much the art complements the comedic side of things, from facial expressions to the opening scenes(Gawd Damn! that opening is good), it was pretty much spot on and congrats to A-1 for occasionally doing well once in a while.
The fact of the matter is that 'Kaguya-sama' is a comedy, and the ideal type of comedy is subjective for every viewer, I try to accept that fact. For the most part, Kaguya-sama does try in many ways to appeal to the majority, done through both childish and subtle mature humor which often is accompanied by a pinch of dramatic irony. But personally, I found myself laughing to tears at certain episodes and chuckling at others while all the while being entertained with my eyes glued to the screen.
*ahem* In short, Kaguya-sama is an original rom-com that utilizes complementary animation and cinematic techniques which correlates really well with the episodic skits. The styles of humor offered in Kaguya-sama appeals primarily to modern teenagers & millennial men, though I believe everyone can easily enjoy the show equally, it definitely has the potential to become one of the funniest shows in 2019. Ironically, Kaguya-sama also introduced indirect forms of comedic value, every time I see a review criticizing the show for the lack of 'character development and depth of story' just makes me laugh so hard because you would think after 66 million years of evolution that humans can tell the basic difference between an episodic series and a sequential one.",9

                I peeped this anime because the mandem were watching it and said it was an xd type of show and I was bored at 12 am. The first episode was intriguing my headtop enough to make me watch another episode, which was more intriguing than the last episode otherwise I would have dropped this anime like Sanjam as a baby.
I rate how mans were battling each other wif love cause even in love you cant take no L's, know that. I thot Ishigami was gonna be a Sasuke TO but then he just turned into a weird incel type mans like Affan. 
Chika was just
                  ur stereotypical idiyappum type anime shordy, but she was okay sometimes; ion know how tf she thot of that clock strategy when playing cards thats actually a mod thonk.
I didn't really rate when Shinomiya became e-girl half way through the show I liked it better when she was roasting Shirogane cause it reminded me of how my parents fought and beat each other while I was growing up. 
Hayasaka kinda coocoo as well but I rated how she made Shinomiya link and build with Shirogane when she was being a dumby. A likkle bit sus how she told Shirogane he could run a battry ting on Shinomiya while she was sick but I'll overlook that cause mans have seen Sayuri b4.
The ending was modddddddddddddddd disappointing; episode 11 was literally just Chika and some mans eating newdels which was jokes but had me thinking the anime was more than 12 episodes since they decided to waste the 2nd last episode on random filler bullshit. The last episode I thot there was gonna be gang shit but they just tickled my schmeat and left me hanging with a boaner. I didnt like how throughout the show they built up this hype for the inevitable confession from one of the two and then it never happened. It makes sense plot wise cuz they bof stubborn waste yutes so I rated that they stuck to their stubbornness but I still wanted to see some cute gay shit or at least Chikas bobbies vro....",8

                I wish I could say that the 'Kaguya-sama: Love is War' was a meaningful experience, full of cathartic themes that tugged at my very core. But it wasn't. And yet, still, I feel compelled to write this review simply because, as I am writing this review, there is a sense of hollowness, or cleansing in my soul as I reflect upon that final episode. One thing is for sure --- I know all too well that I will miss this show.
In terms of innovations, Love is War offers nothing particularly new. It takes a twist on the classic formula of romance --- instead of two
                  individuals finding difficulty in confessing their love for each other, the individuals find difficulty in getting the other to confess. Yet, the anime takes this concept to a comical degree of absurdity that the characters cannot help but be endearing to the viewer. The show doesn't hook the viewer by the typical teasing of confession --- indeed, the anime's premise is that this confession will NOT happen, and this serves as the lodestone of the show's comedy --- but rather, I found myself being hooked by wondering what these supposedly brilliant protagonists will do to fail miserably in their quest for getting the other protagonist to confess.
This seemingly laughable plot forms the basis of projecting the Student Council - the main cast - as a group of lovable idiots. In this, the show reminds me of Konosuba. The attraction of both shows were not necessarily the progression of plot (the plot, one could say, was the medium to convey the comedy), but rather the endearing cast that made the viewer feel as if they were part of that group of lovable idiots.
That is not to say that Love is War was not a completely light-hearted show. Indeed, there were glimpses of tragic themes that, to an extent, makes the absurdity of the show explainable in a rather tragic way. For example, Kaguya's split personality of a cold, stoic, and successful individual contrasts wildly with her repressed, childish inner personality revealed only to the viewer and her faithful servant Hayasaka. Although comedic, the viewer discovers that this disconnect was a product of a strict and cold upbringing by a distant father, under the burden of maintaining the reputation of her family name. However, the glimpses are just glimpses, and the show masterfully weaves these moments as a light backdrop of a light-hearted comedy such that, when these glimpses become obvious, it hits the viewer with a heartful significance that the viewer cannot help but empathize even more strongly with the cast.
Perhaps the ultimate lesson learned from this anime is that a show does not need to portray deep themes in order for the viewer to feel that they went through a wonderful experience.

                Kaguya: Love is War is the product of training a GPT-3† model on the corpus of anime and manga, then asking it to generate two of the most basic tsundere (Kaguya and Miyuki) characters available and a deredere (Chika) character. These characters can never act like real people or else the only thread holding the plot together, that both Miyuki and Kaguya are too prideful to admit they like the other, would immediately collapse. Chika, effectively an agent of chaos, is Schrödinger's idiot: she is simultaneously an expert and utterly incompetent at reading emotions and superficially dumb while being an expert in many things.
Both Kaguya
                  and Miyuki construct scenarios where they can trap the other into confessing their love for them, so the two can date since they are too proud to admit it themselves. Both are clever, scheming, and intelligent, well, supposedly. They concoct situations where every they have conceived every possible outcome, ensuring the other has no room to maneuver. Well, sort of. It's an excellent premise if the characters weren't so generic and the execution hollow.
In an early episode, both Kaguya and Miyuki pretend not to have an umbrella so they can share the other's, a staple of anime romcoms. Since both planned ahead, both pretend not to have an umbrella and now have to trick the other into admitting they have one. Kaguya walks through how Miyuki knew it would rain so he took the train rather than rode his bike, which she knows because she did not see his bike at school. Which, if Miyuki had a modicum of intelligence, would let him know Kaguya looked through the bike rack to trap him, so she too had planned ahead. But rather than have any real battle of wits, so the characters act how we're told they should be, Chika suddenly appears to offer Kaguya her umbrella. We're given a cheap way out of a poorly contrived scenario.
These characters can't act like real people or there wouldn't be a plot. It's at best boring, and for a show revolving around the antics of the two leads, the characters are shallow and generic. It's astounding just how popular this show is for how dull it is.

                Yet another great show from a great season of anime. 
This show is now one of favorite ron coms on the short list of the rom coms that i’ve seen. I wanted every week semi-patiently wanting to see what happened next. Just everything about this show was so great, so many clever relatable jokes. One of the new things about the show is how much you can relate to what’s happening with the characters. You know the exact situations if you fortunate enough to have grown up and had a little romancw in high school or middle school or whatever. The feeling of shriveling up
                  when something goes wrong, or the feeling of complete happiness when something goes your way. It’s so cleverly written. On top of all of this are some clever visuals that only heighten the imagery that goes a long with all the feelings of liking someone. 
10/10 announce season 2 already.",10

                I’ve been holding out on watching Kaguya-sama: Love is war for like a month after it finished airing because I thought it would be another one of those RomComs like Toradora and I don’t want another heartache
Looking back, I should’ve just watched Kaguya-sama while it was airing!
At the renowned Shuchiin Academy, Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya Shinomiya are the student body's top representatives. 
Ranked the top student in the nation and respected by peers and mentors alike, Miyuki serves as the student council president. 
Alongside him, the vice president Kaguya—eldest daughter of the wealthy Shinomiya family—excels in every field imaginable. They are the envy of the
                  entire student body, regarded as the perfect couple.
However, despite both having already developed feelings for the other, neither are willing to admit them. The first to confess loses, will be looked down upon, and will be considered the lesser. With their honor and pride at stake, Miyuki and Kaguya are both equally determined to be the one to emerge victorious on the battlefield of love!
Kaguya-sama: Love is war depicts a story of two influential and powerful individuals with so much pride to the point where liking each other meant getting the other party to fall for them.
The whole ‘Love is war’ concept is very relatable yet original and these contrasting relationship makes the anime far more interesting!
Kaguya Shinomiya, the Vice President of the Student Council. A powerful figure both in school and in the world due to her prestigious background and coming from a family of extreme wealth. And I mean ‘extreme’, her family’s assets equate to 200 trillion yen that’s like almost 2 trillion USD...
Shiragake Miyuki, the President of the Student Council on the other hand comes from an unknown background and isn’t as privileged as Kaguya however, despite that he excels in his academics and is just as proud as Kaguya having built an equally prestigious background of excelling in almost everything he does.
Kaguya and Miyuki share many similarities yet have many differences. Kaguya is a tsundere with a seemingly sadistic nature displayed in her occasional expressions. For some reason I can relate a certain character to Kaguya. Jabami Yumeko from Kakegurui.
Kaguya is extremely competitive and prideful, she was born with a silver spoon (understatement) and looks down on almost everyone (including her friends). However, despite looking down on others she has a caring side to her. Kaguya has a nobility to her, coming from a rich family and all. This makes her extremely determined in keeping her promises and she expects highly of herself and her affiliations. She also has her occasional ‘pride-deprived’ (flustered) moments where her cute side is revealed and heck, Kaguya is as kawaii as kawaii can get! To be honest, whenever Kaguya or Miyuki blushes I just get this sense of fulfilment which at the same time is extremely hilarious seeing people with such a large amount of pride getting embarrassed!!!
Miyuki on the other hand is also a tsundere but with a less sadistic expression and more of a constantly serious look. This fits his ‘cognitive’ characteristic, constantly working his brain and being able to think on his feet. His menacing look really suits his position as the Student Council president which commands a lot of discipline and authority. However, Miyuki is actually a pretty chill individual and I’m actually glad he isn’t one of those dense individuals which I’ve been seeing a lot lately in romance anime. 
Whenever Miyuki makes Kaguya blush it gets extremely hilarious because Kaguya is extremely cute and it usually involves a lot of scheming before she blushes, likewise when Miyuki falls for Kaguya’s traps his quick thinking and his reactions are extremely hilarious as well as when Kaguya’s sadistic expression and victorious face emerges, love it.
Miyuki’s wild imagination causes him to misunderstand many situations and it’s seriously hilarious!
Both Miyuki and Kaguya are masters in many traits with the only exception being romance.
They both have the idea that being rejected or confessing to someone means being the underdog for life. How cute.
Neither of them have any experience in dating and have too much pride to admit that they fell for each other, the funny thing is that both of them know they like each other and are just battling in a tacit war for each other’s love.
Then we have the amazing supporting characters and they are amazing because of the importance of their roles, in all honesty the anime will never be as fulfilling without them.
Chika Fujiwara, she’s essential in this anime and plays a major role as the tension breaker and cheery addition for the two main characters. Her unpredictable nature and occasional unprecedented opinions add spice to the comedy which really brings the anime to further heights. She’s ditzy and very cute it’s always hilarious to see Kaguya getting jealous and cursing the innocent and oblivious Fujiwara. Fujiwara is a very outgoing individual and is close to both Kaguya and Miyuki, because of that she is very open to both of them and often casually talks to Miyuki and makes ‘advances’ to him getting the overly perceptive or the overthinking Kaguya jealous. That is where Kaguya’s sadistic nature would appear making the scene way more hilarious. 
Kaguya’s sadistic side/deadly side is so perfect, it’s a complete opposite from her flustered or arrogant or cute nature!
Then we have Shinomiya’s personal valet hired by Shinomiya’s family, Hayasaka. Apparently Hayasaka is also a student of the school. She is a beautiful young girl with blonde hair, blue eyes and most usually has her hair tied up at the left side of her head. Hayasaka plays a big role in being Shinomiya’s ‘push’ being the one that instigates new methods for Shinomiya to ‘seduce’ Shirogane!
And last but not least we have one of my favourite character, Yu Ishigami. Ishigami is hilarious, he’s like your typical dense protagonist but exaggerated to the point of being completely original and funny! Ishigami’s denseness is next level and the way he communicates is freaking hilarious! He is barely noticed by his colleagues and peers and he is very imaginative. He is the treasurer of the Student Council and actually has a very vivid background which explains why he is so gloomy and depressed all the time. 
Despite his negative attitude, Ishigami is a kind and well-meaning student who suffers an inferiority complex and he is ultimately willing to help others in need, even if it means sacrificing his own pride, and even advised Kaguya Shinomiya to not associate herself with him simply because it may lower her reputation. I really love him a lot and would befriend him in a heartbeat if I knew his harsh background and sob outlook on life with his legitimate reasons to justify it...
But seriously, Ishigami’s honesty due to being too dense is HILARIOUS! I don’t know why but I had a thought that Saitama is what you get when you join Ishigami and Shirogane together
There are other sideline supporting characters in the anime like Miyuki’s kawaii imouto, Kei. Kei is an extremely pretty girl with beautiful white hair, blue eyes and a very pale complexion. 
The interesting thing about Kei is that she seems to share many of the same characteristics as her older brother, being a hard worker and also being kind and self-sacrificial. Her similarities with her brother extend so much to the point that she seems to have developed a nervous attitude towards Kaguya because she admires her greatly.
Despite being so much like her older brother, Kei and Miyuki don’t get along as Kei is going through a rebellious stage in her life. As a result, she is mean and abrasive towards her family, particularly Miyuki as he constantly nags and treats Kei like a child. Though she refuses to admit it, Kei cares about her brother and is deeply interested in his love life, though her pride has prevented her from asking him about it directly. Instead, she is often seen awkwardly stretching around Miyuki when he is trying to figure out how to confess to Kaguya.
Kei Shinomiya is also surprisingly about the same age as the others being only 3 years younger (maybe I’m too used to loli imoutos), the idea of her being in an affiliated school was also a pretty interesting touch. Kei attends Shuuchin Middle School which is very near to the affiliated Shuuchin High School which Miyuki attends. Kei is also part of Shuuchin Middle School’s Student Council which is pretty cool! This goes to show how accomplished they both are.
It’s super cute because Kei is actually very mature and communicates well with even the people older than her, yet because she is still actually very young, she has a childish side that unconsciously gets revealed and gets her all flustered. KAWAII
She’s like a super nice girl when in front of others but once she’s home with her Brother and family, her entire personality just changes... I can relate to that so much and it makes the anime way more relatable and realistic for me, Kei is just so cute 
(because I’ve never actually seen a girl’s rebellious phase, I mean my girlfriend or friends would never reveal it because it’s embarrassing. My little Sister is also just like 7 years old, she has yet to enter the rebellious phase yet. I really wonder if a girl’s rebellious phase is that similar to mine, a guy’s in real life.)
The anime is full of misunderstandings between the main characters due to them not knowing and understanding each other’s thoughts and emotions, also because of their pride they tend to perceive each other’s perspectives and thoughts using their own. 
They tend to overthink, for example they would assume that the other party hates them but in reality the other party is being petty toward someone else. This wouldn’t happen if they would just loosen their pride, talk to each other and hear each other out. But no, their pride is absolute.
In order for something as simple as asking each other out, an elaborate scheme is required to maximise the seduction on the ‘enemy’.
The thought of two people that share many similarities yet are always at loggerheads, always having different opinions yet similar thoughts is just perfect.
I also love the hilarious timing in this anime that leads to loads of hilarious misunderstandings between every character including supporting characters!
A1 pictures did a splendid job in their animation, I didn’t expect it to be this good to be honest. The amount of detail in certain scenes really brings out a lot of emotion to the anime characters and it was really nice. 
Kaguya also has a very nice character design, like I said previously that I can relate her to Jabami Yumeko, it’s not only her red eyes to be honest I can relate the entire anime to Kakegurui.
Kakegurui is what you get when you take Kaguya-sama, take out the romance, and add gambling and raunchy fanservice. Both shows feature the children of the elite attending a boarding school and attempting to outwit each other using mind games and manipulation.
If you like that element of Kaguya-sama but wish it included scenes like a girl pleasuring herself with a side arm while laughing maniacally, check out Kakegurui.
Kaguya has a very nice figure despite her flat chest but flat is justice! She typically wears the school uniform and has her signature red hair band. She has beautiful round red eyes and a nice hair style that corresponds to it. She is a very elegant woman, posh, mature yet with a tinge of childishness the perfect waifu.
Miyuki has a very stern figure and a commanding look however, he is actually quite understanding despite having a lot of pride and looking down on others. He is blonde and has almond upturned blue eyes. He wears his school uniform with his signature gold aiguillette at the collar of his uniform. The aiguillette symbolizes his authority as student council president. That small accessory is actually pretty neat it sort of portrays a small difference yet a big one too. That small difference in uniform commands a humongous difference in authority, a pretty cool interpretation if you think about it.
Chika is just cute, her personality and fashion sense (just a cute little ribbon on her head)! O Kawaii Koto. It really suits her whole ditzy personality and I love it, I wouldn’t mind becoming close friends with her and for some reason she draws that fine line of ‘probably not going in a relationship / not interested in romance’ like many other characters for example the most recent Yotsuba from ‘The Quintessential Quintuplets’. She’s literally there to be cute and add spice and comedy as well as loosen tensions in the atmosphere to maintain the bubbly nature seen in every episode.
Hayasaka is well, unique. Her only role is probably to serve and to serve only Kaguya.
The voice actors did a fabulous job and I honestly didn’t recognise any of them but I loved their voice acting. I thought Kaguya’s voice drew many similarities to Rin Tohsaka but they aren’t the same voice actors. Kaguya’s voice is very satisfying and her occasional sadistic/sarcastic tone just makes her so perfect! I don’t know why but I love female voice actors that speaks in that particular style, similar to Itsuki Nakano from “Quintessential Quintuplets” or Rin Tohsaka from “Fate/Stay Night UBW” it’s Super cute and especially cute when the character is flustered!
Actually sometimes Kaguya’s voice sounds like a child when she’s flustered (sometimes even when she isn’t flustered) How do I put it... Kaguya’s like a mature child if you get what I mean. 
She sometimes sounds like a kid when she is shouting or when flustered... which is, once again I reiterate, extremely adorable! Whenever Kaguya tries to act cute in front of the Miyuki (and it’s reaaaaally cute) it just makes her so much MORE adorable!
Kaguya’s cute baby personality in the ‘visit arc’ was a blessing to watch.. oh god, definitely gonna miss her when I finish the anime, same for all the other characters
To be honest, all of the girls have a childish cute side to them when they are flustered (except Chika, she sounds like a child even when she isn’t flustered) and it’s super duper cute to watch them!
All the Seiyuus did a spectacular job bringing out the most of their characters, they fulfilled their roles so perfectly to the point of letting me feel as if the characters are real!
They made the characters more relatable for me and allowed ‘first-hand’ experience of the cuteness and loveliness of the different characters! I’ve grown to love the different characters partially because of the way they speak and their individually unique methods of communication like their sarcastic remarks or casual chatting etc. 
I doubt the characters can and will be able to leave the same impression if it was any other seiyuu and that the seiyuus were perfect for their roles.
Next, Miyuki. He has a reasonably deep voice that somehow felt very fitting for his personality and stature. His awkward/sarcastic laughter and tone is on point! It never fails to make me laugh, same for Shinomiya’s cute speeches which never fails to make me smile and her sarcastic tone which is so on point! He’s literally like Saitama and even the way he speaks and his hilarious reactions are similar, like I said, Saitama is what you get when you combine Ishigami and Miyuki HAHA!
Chika’s voice is just plain cute and innocent! (Not that she’s 100% pure and innocent though, Kaguya might be way more innocent than her) The EDs were great especially the one where Fujiwara was dancing OMYGOSH!!! That Fujiwara ED blessed my ears and my eyes and everything was just so perfect during that 2 minutes. The catchy lyrics and cute beat, voice and rhythm was perfect! I love voice actor OP and EDs and a lot of anime lately have been adapting this method for more QUALITY FAN SERVICE! 
Lastly, the voice actor of Ishigami, playing the ‘suicidal’ depressed kid that tone and speech is on point! I can relate him so much to my friend that literally has the same type of attitude, character and even speech pattern and accent. It’s literally like seeing my Friend in an anime!
All the Seiyuus this time were so good I wouldn’t mind just listening to them conversing in an ASMR or picture drama!!!
Oh and I can’t forget the narrator and his deep and clear voice with his well-timed narrations, I loved it so much and it wasn’t too much or too little. The narrations were just right and I enjoyed it a lot!
The regular OP and ED were also very good, the OP had a very nice jazzy pop tune and singing while the ED was a nice mellow warm song which felt very fitting and nice throughout the entire anime
Edit: Wow apparently the OP was sung by the Japanese ‘King of Love Songs’ and I took a look at his other songs, they were very nice! 
Love Dramatic, the OP of Kaguya-Sama: Love is War was sung by Masayuki Suzuki
I also love the whole episodic thing with this anime as we get to see how our genius MCs come out with new tactics and watch each of them thinking on their feet to counter each other in the tacit war that is “LOVE”
Some episodes also have the cringe sides to them which literally played out in a way that was so cringeworthy to the point it became extremely hilarious! This anime has brought me joy and laughter and really isn’t your typical run of the mill RomCom.
P.S Fml, Saitama and Miyuki have the same seiyuu... no wonder they sound the same and have the similar reaction patterns etc... even so, I somehow feel Ishigami is similar to Saitama or at least certain characters in OPM.
And if you’re asking who’s best boy/girl which I usually say in my reviews, well...
SHIRIMASEN, I love all of them ALOT.
The girls are cute af, the guys too
The guys are funny af, the girls too
Their sarcastic and sadistic and cute and —— tones/personalities/characteristics/sides are perfect too!!!!!
This anime is my most favourite RomCom by far, no denying it!
The anime is episodic like I said so it hasn’t ended and is still far from over since the two of them haven’t even became an ‘unofficial couple’ despite their many couple moments so I’m hoping for SEASON 2!!!
HYPEd!
TL;DR
50% of this review is about how cute the characters are and how all of them are unique and perfect
I-It’s not like I want you to watch it or anything...

o kawaii koto
This review was written on 05-17-19 and may be outdated. I may have changed my rating due to various reasons.",10
"
                Kaguya-sama is the first anime I’ve ever seen that I watched even vaguely close to its release, enough so that the type surrounding the release of its final few episodes is still fresh in the public’s eye. It’s also the first review I’m writing for an anime that isn’t by Kyoto Animation, and one that has been reviewed with amazing positivity on MAL (8.46 at the time of writing). I started this show by chance rather than by choice, seeing the first two episodes that happened to be selected for viewing at my school’s anime club. I picked up the show again several months later,
                  in a typical case of “KEY works are making me sad again and I need some comedy in my life” blues. In typical fashion, I’ll discuss the visuals, and music, and the characters before starting my assessment of the show.
First – the music. As always the OP and ED form a substantial basis for my overall show rating, as they do wonders to set the tone of the show and draw it to a conclusion with every episode’s passing. The opening, thankfully, absolutely does not disappoint. It’s catchy both musically and in animation style, and it is clear that a lot of thought and development went into making it enjoyable to watch time and time again. It gets stuck in your head, and rightfully so – perhaps the only better thing is watching Masayuki Suzuki perform it live. The ED is much more mediocre, while not exactly bad, while I refuse to comment on Chikatto Chika Chika (seriously, if you’re looking for the fandom that seems to have evolved out of that song, you’ve come to the wrong place). Overall – excellent OP, all-right ED, and generally unobtrusive yet unremarkable soundtrack. 
Next, let’s talk about the art. Unfortunately, the best way I have to describe the art is “uninspired.” It’s never distracting and retains decent consistency, with the insert scenes generally more appropriate to driving the context than not. But it’s not remarkable – at no point in the anime did I ever want to pause and think to myself “that would make a good desktop background,” nor did I ever step-through a scene to appreciate animation subtleties. I realize that I have perhaps too high of standards, and I do appreciate how the backgrounds are generally complete and the color tends to accentuate the setting (typically a rich kids’ school) fairly well. Not bad.
Moving on to the characters, let’s first get the obvious out of the way. I do absolutely consider the narrator a character, and I do not hesitate to say that he is my favorite in the entire show. With the oversaturated comedy genre, the best that a studio can hope is to make something really unique: either soundtrack (barring the OP, Kaguya-sama doesn’t achieve), the art (definetely fails), or the characters, and it somehow manages on this final point through the narrator. The narrator sets the tone of the show, gives exposition and context, and declares the overall winner (or loser) of the day’s war. Kaguya-sama stays true to the “Love is War” aspect of its title, but goes so far as to assign an official arbitrator and judge of to whom is granted the victory. I’ve read criticisms of the narrator in the past – “Why? What’s the point of saying who won? He talks too much and it annoying!” I, however, respectively disagree – the mediocrity of the other characters and the uniqueness of the narrator’s place make him stand out. The narrator is my favorite part of the anime, and I appreciate what A-1 has done with him. If it’s worth anything, he’s much of the reason why my rating is as high as it is.
I wish, however, I could laud the other characters to the same degree. The two mains – Kaguya and Miyuki – are locked in a war of brains and pride, both attempting to trick or coerce the other into admitting their love for the opposite. I don’t have an issue with this motif: as a matter of fact, its ridiculous degree really helps improve the comedy of the series, and I don’t believe it behooves the anime to stray from it throughout the entire series. My struggle comes with the characters themselves. Kaguya is a typical tsundere, desiring strongly to hide both her true feelings for Miyuki and even her want to make and remain friends with her peers. However, there’s little to suggest any subtleties to her character beyond this, and it’s never apparent to me that the studio is referencing her ambivalent qualities in a self-aware sort of way. Her only other character traits seem to be summed up in being extremely smart, capable, rich, and innocent – again, nothing new, unique or subtle. Frustratingly, several episodes do attempt some further exposition on her character, attempting to draw out some redemptive character traits, but these are frequently thrown to the wayside when the tsundere comes back into play. Consequently, it’s hard to see her “love” for Miyuki being any more than an obsession or a desire to possess him in the same way that she possesses money, smarts or beauty, and her treatment of Chika and Yuu help to further this standpoint.
Miyuki, on the other hand, possesses far more redeeming qualities than his female counterpart. He, too, is extremely proud and intelligent, but lacks the high upbringing of Kaguya and possesses much more obvious care for those around him. While perhaps considered a Tsundere, Miyuki is better described as feigning indifference rather than cold. He considers Yuu a friend rather than an object (similarly, though to a lesser extent, Chika as well), and seems to legitimately care for his sister and family. He is proud but more a good person than a bad, and I found myself rooting for him to win the daily wars more than his female counterpart. Unfortunately, he also suffers from the same issue of flatness, with little being described or developed in his character.
Finally, we move to the two supports, Chika and Yuu. If Kaguya and Miyuki are flat, Chika is perfectly two-dimensional. Her point is to provide comedic relief, which she does to a certain extent, but most of the comedy comes more in how she interacts with the other members of the student government rather than by virtue of her own character. She is an airhead – not a bad thing, as we see in other anime – but easily tricked and manipulated by Kaguya, and more or less seen as a nuisance by Miyuki. I can’t wrap my head around the fandom’s obsession with her. Yuu, on the other hand, I found much more interesting, because he often voices concepts foreign to the other members of the party (his reference to Stockholm Syndrome was the single funniest part of the anime), and is not obsessed with his smarts in the same way that Kaguya and Miyuki are. Yuu, along with Chika, is the pervert of the group but unlike Chika actually shows some legitimate character development that isn’t immediately discarded by the next scene. Good? No, but more interesting than the others.
At last, we settle on the plot and story. Like I said earlier, the anime is a story of war and the battles that progress between the two characters. As a comedy, it does quite well. Sure, the jokes are repeated and self-explanatory, but unlike so many other comedies it leans more heavily on crudeness rather than visual fanservice that I can’t help but appreciate it more. Many of the comedic moments come from bouncing the characters’ conflicting personalities off of each other, with Kaguya and Miyuki going to extreme degrees to gain even the smallest of perceived “advantages” over the other. In that way, it is indeed a criticism of the “huge confession” trope – after just a few episodes, it’s clear that a confession isn’t going to happen from other side, and even the tiniest victories mean everything to the main characters! Insightful? Not really, but definetely entertaining. 
However, the series begins to struggle a bit near the end, where the writers decide to diverge from the purely-comedic roots and attempt to follow a bit of a drama development in the final few episodes. At first, it seems acceptable, as this isn’t foreign to other parts of the series, but it quickly becomes forced rather than spontaneous. Furthermore, the drama development is focused too late in the series to bring new insights to the comedy and leaves the viewer wondering why the writers would switch focus so close to the end. The end of the anime is frustrating since it neither develops the characters meaningfully or continues on the comedic status quo satisfactorily. 
So overall, I give this anime a weak recommendation, assuming you enjoy the opening as much as I did, and if you can put up with the mediocre characters for some decent comedy and lackluster drama. Some people are obsessed with this anime (just look at the Kaguya_sama subreddit, wowza), and I think that’s cute. Do you know what I’ve really confessed my love to?  Narration by Yutaka Aoyama. Oh, yeah.",6
"
                Probably anyone ho knows this anime knows how hyped it it is. And as I always heard good reviews about it I decided to watch it. 
This was honestly very boring for me. There's nothing really special about the plot except their psychological battle which was the only save. Besides that the story is mid. I really don't understand why ppl like this so much.
As for the characters, they're also nothing special. They're both kinda annoying to me and lack depth as well as they're barely interesting. 
The whole story is uninteresting as well as repetitive. The art is good and I also like the
                  op but that's it. 
Overall the story is quite boring and doesn't really make any sense. I only saw the gif of that girl dancing(forgot name) and then saw multiple reviews so I tried it out and I tried not to sleep. But maybe it's just me.

                Love is war? More like, love is a childish game of back and forth. Have I outgrown the genre? The plot is as basic as it gets and I can't for the life of me like the main couple. They're supposed to be elite, right? Yet they're completely and utterly emotionally constipated, it's painful to watch. These little 'games' of 'we both know we have a crush on each other ahaha but please notice I'm in love with u uwu' get stale quickly. Bonus points for Chika, she's the reason I finished watching season 1. I wish she was the protagonist because her personality is
                  fun and interesting. Wouldn't continue this anime at gunpoint. The animation is good, just also nothing unique about it. Banger intro though, I'll give it that.",2
"
                I was initially hesitant to watch this, because I greatly dislike romantic drama, especially when it's contrived and between kids. They tend to fall into a trap of starting comedic, but getting less and less funny over time. But this anime was great! It has laugh-out-loud funny pretty much the entire time, and the more serious moments were actually meaningful to me. 
The characters and their interactions are the core of the show. You might think that a show with a child genius, foodie airhead, ultra-competent tsundere Ojou-sama, and shut-in computer-saavy gamer would get old quickly, but these shallow descriptions actually do not adequately capture
                  these characters. The child genius works incredibly hard, is rather poor, and internally struggles terribly with how to maintain his image in front of Kaguya. The tsundere actually has a lovely dere side, and has numerous funny quirks that I thought were great. In fact she is far more tsun in Miyuki's mind than in reality! The other two side characters are also a necessity. The airhead especially introduces an element of chaos into these mind games, messing up the intricate plans of the two mains. I loved it. However, one of the most amusing interactions was between Yuu and Kaguya. I promise you will find their antics funny. 
The plot revolves around Kaguya and Miyuki trying to outdo one another, by each getting the other to admit their feelings first, in order to preserve their pride - ostensibly anyway, because in reality they seem to just be bashful. Okawaii koto. Both being quite smart (and Kaguya having an abnormal amount of resources available), these ""games"" tend to be amusingly complex and over the top. 
One thing that surprised me was the depth of Kaguya's character, and I actually really empathized with her when she was feeling down at some points. Yes, that's right: I sympathized with a gorgeous billionaire that is skilled at nearly everything without trying, with a literal personal maid, and is even a tsundere to boot (a character type I tend to dislike). Part of the reason is her own astuteness regarding herself: objectively, she knows that her position is enviable to say the least, yet she cannot help but pine for that which she cannot have. All of us suffer from this effect, as it is human nature to experience happiness relative to ever-moving baseline.
As the show progresses, the characters do as well, especially the mains. I really appreciated watching them grow closer and more comfortable with each other, and how their interactions and thoughts changed over time. You feel like you got to grow with them. 
Interestingly, I know that others seem to feel there were too many character tropes and too little growth; however, the former rarely bothers me in anime (and in fact here I felt they weren't too bad) and I simply disagree with the latter. One possible complaint is that their ""genius"" natures were there in name only (i.e., the only real proof of their intellectual prowess was their academic grades), but personally I find child genius depictions tend to be annoying and ridiculous, especially when they are unexplained (""hey I'm 8 and I just built my first particle accelerator""), whereas here they are simply regular but slightly intellectually gifted children (say, a reasonable 3 std deviations out, instead of a million) - this makes their flaws and mistakes more understandable, and in this case I prefer it.
Despite all these positive traits, there are some minor annoyances throughout the show. Once in a while the drama gets a little cringey; e.g., with characters being a little too whiny or melodramatic, which I thought felt out of character. I also found the first few episodes a little irritating in some aspects. The narrations were hit-or-miss for me. Lastly, I needed more of the Shirogane imouto!!!
I have no complaints about the art and sound. The ED in particular was very pretty in my opinion. Technically, the animation was pleasing to the eye. 
To summarize along the classic anime dimensions:
 - Moe: a little bit present
 - Comedy: pretty good 
 - Drama: low 
 - Action: none 
 - Romance: plenty, though in the pre-together stage 
 - Harem: none 
 - Ecchi: very low 
Let me just say these are my own opinions, as someone who generally dislikes the presence of forced romantic drama or pseudo-""realistic"" relationships, and enjoys a good moeblob and CGDCT. So my tastes are perhaps abnormal. If you want a complex love story with heart-rending drama, complicated intellectually stimulating plotlines, or a psychological thriller, then this is not for you. I would call this a low-stress slice-of-life comedy, with romance in the standard sense being a secondary genre, despite being a focus of the plot. Nevertheless, if you want a funny relaxing show with some cute aspects to it, then I think this is a good choice. :)",9
"
                If I was to describe this series metaphorically, I'd say it's breaking out of a good relationship wherein it is given that you had fun and enjoyed the experience, but undeniably, it was a waste of time because you realize that all those experiences would later on turn out to be insignificant and that in the end, you didn't get to where you're supposed to be. You'd think things were finally progressing and then you're back from where you started. Basically, it is enjoyable to watch, but not worthwhile in my opinion.
Maybe all it intended was to provide comic relief, but I just felt that
                  the show seemed to develop the plot in some way and it's almost hilarious how it failed miserably.",6
"
                This anime is really one of a kind! Everything about it is new and refreshing.
Story:-7/10
This anime is episodic in nature. Each episode involves both the main characters desperately trying to make the other confess his/her love to them. This leads to hilarious situations.
Art:-9/10
Fluid and feels good on the eyes.Also,a significant amount of effort has been made on the ending of episode 3(Chika's dance).It is like nectar for the eyes.
Sound:-8/10
The opening is really awesome, gives other openings of the season good competition.
Character:-8/10
The main characters are really fun to watch, and even the way the narration takes place is amusing.
Enjoyment:-8/10
There are little to no dull moments. The naive nature of Kaguya leads to many rib-tickling moments.
Even if you are not a big fan of Romance/Drama, you should definitely check this one out!",8
"
                This anime is a masterpiece of comedy and romance. 
(Some spoilers ahead)
The writer weaves intricate webs of inner dialogue from the two protagonists and turns the simplest of interactions into a battle of the minds. The constant unspoken battle of egos creates some sublime and totally original comedic material and the fast paced narration keeps you hooked.
The romance between the 2 protagonists is so beautifully crafted that it completely blew me out of the water. Their personalities and character flaws clash wonderfully. Every interaction between them feels like it was written with the utmost of care.
Kaguya's character brought me to tears, which is something that
                  a romcom character has never done. The storyline rapidly reaches its crescendo as Kaguya's relationship (or lack thereof) with her family is revealed and she laments that she only wants to experience her youth with the only people who care for her. The reveal of her tragic backstory helps you to understand why Kaguya acts the way she acts. It exposes her character in such a raw and brutal way so suddenly that you can't help but get emotionally invested in her. I truly was moved by her character which speaks volumes for the powerful writing in this anime.
You can tell this anime is a labor of love. The art and sound are great and the voice acting is top notch. The opening music is perfect for this anime (not to mention, super catchy) and they even have Chika perform her own ED theme in one episode (which, incidentally, is the cutest damn thing in the history of anime). 
Normally I can write pretty long reviews but this anime has left me speechless. It has totally exceeded all of my expectations. My one regret is that it is only 12 episodes long.",10
"
                Kaguya-sama: Love is war is as a complete scrub at romance anime friggin great. The show has a colorful cast of characters, great comedic moments and a great romance between two tsunderes.
I especially liked the romantic chemistry between Miyuki and Kaguya as they had great chemistry between them that leads to the comedic value of the two constantly overthinking their approach to romance for fear of rejection. 
In terms of characters,  Hayasaka, Ishigami and Chika provide an excellent backing track to the two's romance, as they provide some of the best romcom moments I've seen this year.
In conclusion this is a great romantic-comedy with
                  tons of character that'll leave you with asmile on your face.",9
"
                I've been reviewing a lot of retro anime, lately. So how about I review something a little more new for the children. This show is the epitome of ""Just kiss and make up."" What happens when two geniuses fall in love with one another, but can't confess their love? You get Kaguya-sama: Love is War. Shuchiin Academy is a school filled to the brim with talented and rich students of the upper class. Kaguya Shinomiya, the vice president of the student council at Shuchiin Academy. And Miyuki Shirogame, the student council president of Shuchiin Academy. Both students are at the top of their class, and
                  are exceedingly popular. And I guess having good grades equates to sex appeal because both characters are madly in love with one another, however the two can't admit their feelings, because that would damage their pride or something like that. So for the entire season you see these two characters have this mental war with each other to see who will crack first, I guess, I'm a little unclear on what's happening. Confessing your love is looked down upon at Shuchiin Academy, that's all you need to know!
We have side characters like, Chika Fujiwara, the secretary who plays the mediator character for Kaguya and Miyuki's u̶s̶e̶l̶e̶s̶s̶ ̶b̶i̶c̶k̶e̶r̶i̶n̶g̶ hilarious arguments. Just in case Kaguya wasn't enough fan service for you disgusting pigs, we have Chika who's at least three cup sizes bigger than Kaguya. And we have the treasurer, Yuu Ishigami. A nervous wreck of a man that makes me wonder why is he even in the student council to begin with? When he was first introduced I thought I wasn't going to like him at all, until I saw a specific scene later on in the show where he notices that Chika is using a different conditioner in her hair and can smell the difference, too. Chika replies with, ""That's pretty creepy."" The man has a nervous breakdown and leaves the room. I love that scene! I also have the weird talent of noticing different things about other people that they themselves don't even notice. When he left the room, I saw Yuu as a son of mine.
My biggest problem with this show is that you're suppose to care about Kaguya and Miyuki's pussy spat. None of this would be the case if the two were just honest with their feelings. Dear god, I'm getting Orange Road flashbacks! That's what the entire show is riding on, these characters having a mind game. It's just not strong enough as a concept, and a lot of the situations and ideas the characters think of are just plain stupid and irrational. I thought these two were in the top of their class!? I guess they don't teach love and affection at Shuchiin Academy, what a shame. The old, tired out anime trope where characters misunderstand one another, misunderstand the situation or god forbid both, and just make fools of themselves has been used for decades. Kaguya-sama doesn't do anything new or interesting with that kind of comedy. Characters will look at a situation, misinterpret it very blatantly, and then do something stupid. It's not funny. 
There is one thing I do like about this show. The visual presentation is pretty great; very Shaft-esque. It's not quite on the level of Shaft, but it reminds me of them. If you're a fan of studio Shaft and you love their visual aesthetic, give this show a quick watch. Or maybe you can just find clips online. Is Kaguya-sama a banana, because it's very visually apPEELing. A friend of mine recommended this anime to me and I told him that joke. He loved it. *Me making a winky face at the friend who is probably reading this right now* The soundtrack was nothing special. It just sounds like white noise to me, with the exception of the OP. The song for the OP, ""Love Dramatic"" was cool. And the voice acting was okay. I didn't really know anybody. I'll give this show a 5.1 out of 10. I believe it's better than Kimagure Orange Road and I love Chika's baps! I'd put those titties in my mouth! Wash it down with a little Ice Mountain!",5
"
                Kaguya-sama Love is War is the pinnacle of comedy-romance anime and is absolutely beautiful.
The premise of trying to make them confess to each other so they don't lose the war of love in itself has never been covered spicing up the romance genre and its beautifully executed in this series with its over the top reactions that make me die of laugher every episode. I'd compare it closely with Aho Girl or One Punch Man with its reactions.
The characters are all absolutely lovable with each of the main student council members playing a key comedic role. Kaguya the cute rich tsudere which is in direct
                  contrast to Miyuki who is poor but hard working, while there's Chika who disrupts the two to make each episode less predictable or make grand plans anticlimactically end with a funny joke. Finally Ishigami who is the depressed type who ends up being the pushover in the series but can get surprisingly talkative when giving his opinions which always makes me laugh.
The romance between Miyuki and Kaguya is so cutely innocent which is really refreshing as we don't get many innocent romances with little to no drama which made Kaguya-sama that much more enjoyable to watch.
The music is amazing with the catchy OP which sings the song of ""Love is War"" which really adds to the theme the series is going with and the infamous Chika dance which further adds to the uniqueness and charm of the anime.
Kaguya-sama Love is War was easily my favourite anime of Winter 2019 from its over the top reactions to the adorable moments of romance I'd definitely recommend this series to any fans of comedy or those looking for a non-drama romance anime. I think it'll be very hard for any future romance comedies to beat this series.
10/10 absolutely loved it and will definitely re-watch again in the near future.",10
"
                tl;dr: It's like the potato chip scene from Death Note was turned into a romcom anime
Art: It matches the tone of the show perfectly with its over the top expressions and animations, while still toning it down for some of the softer, kinder moments.
Sound: The VAs are the real heroes here. Each member of the main cast gives an excellent performance. The OST is pretty great too, keeping with the tone in a similar manner as the animation.
Character: It's pretty rare to have all of the protagonists be likeable, but that's the case here. Miyuki and Kaguya have excellent chemistry despite their differences, and their
                  ""high IQ"" attitudes provide a genuinely believable reason as to why they haven't gotten together yet. Chika is the deceptively intelligent airhead, who, while not that unique on her own, exists to add an element of chaos to the scheming tsunderes, and fufills that role perfectly. Hayasaka, on a similar note, is very much Kaguya's backbone, giving her a mental and emotional support to lean on. Ishigami isn't as defined by his relationships as much, but his fearful relationship with Kaguya does highlight how intimidating they look from an outsider's perspective, as well as how unexpected their kindness may be.
Enjoyment: If you enjoy over the top comedy, this is likely for you. It's no Nichijou, but the absurd lengths Kaguya will go to can get a genuine laugh out of me. The running gags are used sparingly enough that they don't grow stale, and the legitimately likeable cast makes you want to see them succeed.
Story: The sole issue I have with the anime isn't exactly an issue with the show, but instead of the genre. The ""will they won't they"" aspect is there, even if it's better justified than in most romcoms. The over-the-top nature does help with this, and the progress they've made so far hints that they will actually progress beyond that point.",9
"
                It's a crimeee how funny Kaguya was. Easily one of the hilarious original shows I've ever watched. Every single episode is packed with hilarious scenes. One of my favorite animes ever just for the jokes alone.  It was so invigorating to see such an innovative anime in this genre. At first I thought, it was far too pretentious in its approach. From the gate, the show dove right into it’s battle of wits, more than once. I didn’t know what I was watching. But after episode 2 onwards, I purchased front row tickets. I was mesmerized. The writing in this show is absolutely brilliant.
                  Plot twists like you wouldn’t believe, and mind games out of this world. I especially love how over the top it was. The whole thing sort of mocks your other favorite outsmart type anime’s that we all loved and spins it’s own identity to it. Kinda like a parody element, which is always amazing when done right. 
There wasn’t a specific recipe Kaguya followed. You will never be able to follow it. Just ready for it. I really appreciate how Kaguya took the idea of not wanting to be first, and ran with it. The levels you go to manipulate the other to confess first is more relatable that we fail to admit. While most of this season was laughs, when it wanted to be serious, the dialogue had depth and was relatable. 
It might just be me, but I do want to add that reading the English subs wasn’t that great of an experience. I feel like there was errors in the names, the speed, and altogether just a bit too much to read while enjoying the illustrations. I usually never ever have problems to this extent but I found my self going back 10 seconds very often. Maybe I need to sharpen my sub following skills. 
However, the animation was perfect. A lot of unsuspecting action with killer animations throughout. Fujiwara will be missed for all the over the top sequences she championed. The soundtrack was great and though not my first choice for an OP and ED, they’re still stuck in my head. All in all, a VERY hilarious plot and definitely relatable from the actual war, to the minds of characters themselves. Kaguya-sama is a show I can honestly watch over and over and find something new to obsess over and enjoy. It was a extremely fun watch.",9
"
                OK.As an Indian,i have seen several movies and shows like this one and this hence became annoying.Miyuki and Kaguya relationship is similar to Sheldon and Amy from Big Bang Theory however with the intervention of Death Note.What makes this thing interesting is that we see 2 nerds fight with their wits.The feel of the anime is like a Shonen but it is brains over brawns.The mind tricks used are weak but is interesting(taking inspiration from everyday life).The characters except for the star crossed lovers are just show piece characters(PS Chika supremacists,you need to see the doctor.You love her for her bust size).
Miyuki is an ideal
                  character.A boy who is a confident genius and Kaguya,a rich girl who is a master of all trades.The characters are pretty insecure to be honest but hide their insecurities properly.
The anime is overhyped most probably because the genre itself is pretty weak(exceptions are always there).The series is a good parody of the Social classes but i feel that it just feels like a disney princess movie.The anime is just heavily memed and i feel that this is why i am not a fan of this show.If it ran like a normal one(like tomo chan) i can understand but since there is no character development,it was bad",4
"
                There are so many positive reviews about Kaguya-sama that I almost feel like I missed something.  Maybe I'll rewatch this show someday simply because of that fact, however, for now, these were my initial thoughts about the show.
As another review stated, we open the show being blatantly told that the two main characters like each other.  We are simply expected to care about this development despite the fact that we barely even know the characters.  As a sucker for more emotional romances, this was a big turn-off for me.
If you're into the short episodic format, then this show is for you. 
                   Kaguya-sama opts for a more comedic stance which makes the episode-by-episode format work for it.  The jokes in the show were simply just not my cup of tea and coupled with some pretty flat characters, I just couldn't find myself all that into the show.  
However, my main issue is the complete lack of development.  If you're watching the show for more comedic purposes, then it would fill that quota.  In terms of actual romantic development... there is close to none.  For the first 11 episodes, we follow the silly antics of the characters that ultimately lead to no real development.  In the 12th episode, we are suddenly hit with somewhat of a ""backstory"" for Kaguya, however, by the end of the show, we are no closer to a confession than at the beginning of the show.  
Overall, I just really cou;dn't get inro Kaguya-sama.  It felt 2d and awkward at best.  However, the animation is great and I liked the opening (not so much the ending).",6
"
                This show does what it sets out to do: Make fun at the tsundere archetype and it does a great job of pushing it to the limit. To set things straight, I HATE TSUNDERES. Sorry. But the way that the show was made to be so comedic and over the top in a satirical way made this very enjoyable.
This anime is not deep. It isn't supposed to be. For those who are disappointed that it wasn't as 'deep' or 'realistic' as they expected, realize that this was never the intention of this show. It is obvious that the characters in love will beat around the
                  bush. I can't stress enough how the point of the anime is to make fun of it.
Two tsunderes are put together for you to have a laugh. The gag characters included synergize well with the story and the artwork plus over exaggerated effects definitely complement the overall atmosphere of the anime. If you want to have a laugh at an anime that clearly isn't meant to be analyzed seriously, then this is definitely something that you will enjoy. 
Edit, after completing the series: The pacing of the show is pretty decent, leading to the ultimate crescendo of the summer festival. It's a stereotypical event, but the show's take on it gave it a slight breath of fresh air and deviated from the usual execution just a bit. I would've preferred an ending with a bit more closure, but that's how anime is. I'd still recommend others to try it out.",9
"
                I loved the first three episodes of this anime! I thought they launched off the anime with a cool concept and I liked how they used the art to make it feel intense during the ""love war""! However after the first three episode I felt like it lost that mood that drew me to this anime. 
The characters didn't seem like geniuses anymore. The started to seem a bit more blan. However as the main couple lost their appeal to me the supporting characters grew on me. By the end of this anime I liked the supporting characters much more and didn't care as much
                  for the main couple. 
Overall 7/10. I would recommend this anime to people who like a good ol' rom-com. I wish the anime had been able to retain that intense mood it had initially but maybe they'll be able to bring it back a bit in season 2.",7
"
                Let's work from the bad to good. I haven't been this excited about a show in a while.
As for the story, it's clearly structured in a manga format. Also, you can pretty much get the gist of how the story is going to go for after a few episodes. Each episode is divided up into sections, which kind of broke up the flow for me (compared to shows like Toradora where it all blends together nicely).
The art is fine. Not much bad to say about it. The expressions on their faces are hilarious sometimes.
The sound nondescript, but the score gets a bump up from that
                  wonderful OP song ""Love Dramatic."" Catchy as hell and Masayuki Suzuki's crooning is wonderful. Listen to the full song if you get the chance. I love it when anime gives me songs worthy enough to add to my library. Also, one of the EDs for the episodes is different, and that ED is definitely something to watch out for. You've been warned.
Our main pair consisting of titular Kaguya Shinomiya and the Student Council President Miyuki Shirogane are full of personality, and their mind-gaming antics drive the course of the entire show. Their backgrounds act as foils for each other, but despite that, they're both playing the same game on equal footing. Both of their schemes are comical in their obsessiveness, and both of them are equally ridiculous when they're caught off-guard.
There are some other major characters, but they also have distinct and wonderful personalities. I'll let you discover them for yourself, and then you can play the game of ""who's my favorite?""
Overall, while the show's concept is cute and is lauded as the Death Note of romances, it doesn't particularly stick out to me as anything other than another typical  ""Will they confess?"" anime, and it fails to put a smile on my face. I give it a 6.
(HE'S LYING. THIS ANIME WAS CUTE AF AND HE HAD A SMILE PLASTERED ON HIS FACE THE WHOLE TIME, ONLY PUNCTUATED BY GIGGLING AND THE OCCASIONAL ""SO CUTE!"" HE EAGERLY WAITED EACH WEEK FOR THE NEW EPISODE TO COME OUT AND IT WAS HIS FAVORITE ANIME OF THE SEASON. HE GAVE IT A 9.)",9
"
                I noticed some chika dance memes, but couldn't be bothered to watch this anime, then spring 2019 comes with new animes, I kinda wanna review those winter animes I've missed and wanted to see if there's any good ones that I skipped, and I glad I did, boy I would live in regret if I didn't watch this one here.
Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai is that type of anime with those kind of relationships we wanted but only happen in our delusional mind and some could be related with our life. Those 'what if' and excessive thinking inside of our head, daydreaming about someone when in real
                  life we did nothing as we choke up on our own ego thinking our crush would start the first move. 
The first episode is enough to make you watch the whole series, very strong introduction, both characters and type of plot. The opening music, Love is War, is phenomenal, I straight away like the OP. Chika dance and the ending song is also fun, so a 10 from me. 
Overall: 9 / 10",9

"
                Huge disappointment!
Story: The story is weak and the episodes are very repetitive. You can watch 12 episodes with exactly the same scenario. It gets really boring after 3 episodes. We can watch petty mind games which are on the level of an elementary schooler's. Lots of cliches and dumb humor. The story is going absolutely nowhere. 3/10
Art: Art is the only good point of this anime. It looks pretty and well animated. 8/10
Sound: Alright. However, this whole narrating not much fun after a few episodes. Voice actors are fine. 6/10
Characters: The characters are all useless. They do not have proper personalities. Typical cliche cast: genius
                  main couple (but they are not that cool like they look), dumb girl ( who is always appearing at the worst times), and a depressed otaku ( his main character trait that he is an otaku). They all act childish and it seems like non of them born with any backbones as they are just the biggest cowards in the world. The makers tried to push this pride and genius thing on the two mains, but PLEASE....it has nothing to do with anything.  3/10
Enjoyment: It was painful and annoying to watch many times. Also, it was boring after a few episodes. 4/10
Overall: I really don't get it how this anime got such a high score with such a poor story and characters. I would not recommend this to any of my friends. So many much better animes out there which would deserve a second season more than this. I can't even say this is light fun stuff to watch as it's more painful to watch their struggle than fun. Also, another annoying thing is that the narrator and the characters talk then some writing pops up at the same time, so it's impossible to watch without stopping it every second to be able to read everything on the screen. (Japanese sound/English sub) AAAhhh this whole made me very disappointed and it pissed me off. 5/10",5
"
                I seriously find people calling this anime overrated and it just doesn't fit with it at all. 
Though I watched it only after it was completely aired, I still found this Anime so so enjoyable!! People call this overhyped, overrated but I think they just don't wanna admit that it's pretty enjoyable and funny!! 
I think that the characters are natural and fit the environment, and the plot actually progresses reasonably. Of course, this contains the common romance anime troupes, but I enjoy how they use these troupes and make it into something much more than an average Romcom anime!! 
The circumstances created by Shinomiya
                  and Miyuki sometimes go overboard for sure, but that's exactly what is enjoyable bout such a show, these two so far for each other just because they love each other so much!!",9
"
                I love this show for a few reasons. Kaguya's thought process is exactly what mine was in high school when it came to boys. And I can imagine the president's thought process being realistic as well. And that would be enough to make a humorous enough show, but then they threw Chika in. Chika is best girl! I don't know how they managed such a perfect mix for her. Just the right cuteness, cleverness, silly personality all mixed with some quirks and the perfect voice actor. 
STORY: The story is great. The theory overall is advertised as ""in the most prestigious school, it's all about
                  who has the most power in a relationship!"" But it's more like ""two tsunderes refuse to confess their love for one another and hilarity ensues."" More than that, the president often has meticulous plans laid out, while Kaguya uses her family's money and influence to lay her own plans, and these plans are foiled in small, subtle ways by Chika, who is completely innocent (except when she's throwing dirty jokes at Kaguya to make her laugh, of course).
ART: Typical anime fare, nothing to write home about. I was hoping they'd do more with the war theme. Especially considering the beauty of the eyes that they're going for, I was hoping for something more like you see in Kakeguri. But it's fine, no complaints. 
SOUND: Well, the music is great. I never got sick of listening to the OP, and then there's Chika's song that is just a masterpiece. The nuances of the main trio's voice acting is really perfect. You can find little snippets on YouTube of, for instance, Chika being adorable one second and flipping out the next, rapping, and making adorable sounds of frustration with the president's lack of athletic skills. 
CHARACTER: I will definitely be reading the manga after watching the anime, because I felt that there wasn't nearly enough character development for Kaguya's maid and the student council treasurer. I wasn't sure what we were meant to feel for him; he makes inappropriate and sexist comments, but Kaguya calls him friend. I don't, at any point, like this guy. Then there's some random stalker following a certain couple around, that is never explained. But the other characters are all likeable, especially our main trio. 
OVERALL: Reminded me of Wotakoi or Nozaki-kun. Really great, especially when plans go awry or when Kaguya thinks way too hard about something and immediately flips her opinion when things change again. There was only one episode I disliked because one character went from being adorable to being fanservice, and she didn't need that - everyone already loved her!",10
"
                I think what's amazing about anime is its potential to turn a ridiculous premise into a masterpiece of a show. Such is the case with Kaguya-sama: Love Is War. The two greatest geniuses of Shuchiin Academy, student council President Miyuki Shirogane and Vice President Kaguya Shinomiya falls in love with one another. However, to fall in love is to lose, and both of their prides are too great for that. The result is a battle of wits to make the other person confess their love first. Yes, Love Is War.
Throughout the course of the show, the two face off in a series showdowns: from a
                  10-questions guessing game to simply making the other eat cake. The ridiculousness of their refusal to simply confess and the absurdity of their ability to predict each other’s moves blends into a psychological romcom never seen before. The two make up one of the most hilarious couples in anime.
However, the rest of the cast doesn’t fall short either. The two are accompanied by the unpredictable student council secretary, Chika Fujiwara, and the emo but observant treasurer, Yu Ishigami. Chika in particular plays a large role early on, often ruining the plans of the two, and sometimes makes us wonder if it’s intentional or not. She gained a massive following after the now legendary Chika dance, which was beautifully animated in the episode 3 ending. Ishigami is mysteriously missing throughout the first half of the series, but comes out in the second half as a character that is all too relatable. Easily hurt and just wanting to play games, he rose up to become one of the community’s most favorite male characters of the season. Last but definitely not the least, there’s also Kaguya’s personal assistant and the best gril (fight me), Ai Hayasaka. I think everyone can connect with this character a lot, given how disappointed she is at how stupid the situation Kaguya is in right now, just like us. She’s also the coolest person in the cast, being able to have different disguises and being Kaguya's support at all times, whether during her antics or during her saddest moments. Basically, this small but lovable cast is one of the strongest points of the anime.
What takes this show to a whole other level though, is the visuals. It's may not have the best of animation, but it definitely features the best of direction. Despite the limitations with production, Mamoru Hatakeyama and his team was able to elevate this manga adaptation with an array of cinematography and animation techniques. Character actions, reactions, intentions and even monologues are exaggerated, supplemented or wonderfully accompanied by the amazingly directed visuals. Despite being a work under A1 Pictures, the show follows more of the iconic Shaft style that Hatakeyama has years of experience on.
If there's any flaw with this anime, it's the same flaw that attacks all comedy anime: not all gags and skits are gonna work out. This is especially evident in the later episodes, where sometimes I would personally feel tired that Chika interrupts once again, or a stalemate comes out as usual. Everything is saved though, thanks to the end of episode 11 and the finale. The show takes a pause from all the gags to show us why Kaguya was an ice cold person in the past. The show reminds us the common downside of being a daughter of the elite: you're separated from your peers. The heartwarming part of the finale is when the focus shifts from the two for a very short moment. Kaguya wanted to see the fireworks with everyone. We see the student council simply as a group of friends for the first time, at least before Kaguya just stares at Shirogane instead of the fireworks. This change of pace made the return of the comedy segment in the second half more memorable, and the show ends as stupid as it started. Kaguya and Shirogane still misunderstood each other, and neither refuses to take down their pride.
At this point, the only capital crime of this anime is to not have a season 2. This is a fresh breath of air among the slew of subpar romcoms and harems that have come out in the past years. For now, I'll be reading the manga I guess.
To think a psychological romcom would be a possible combination for a great show. Amazing.
P.S. The opening theme is an absolute banger. Nice touch by the team behind this to get Japan's King of Love Songs to sing it.",10
"
                This anime is a light-hearted rom-com between two smart characters, so if you're here looking for a serious mind battle like Death Note that deals with serious topics and lessons, then you're in the wrong spot. 
Story 9/10: Basically the love story of two tsunderes. Both likes each other but couldn't confess first because they believe the one who confesses first in a relationship is the weaker one, and both of them are too prideful to be the ""loser"". And so each conversation is a mind battle. They think ahead before they speak and lay traps in their speech to force a confession out of
                  the other. I rate this 9/10 because it's so rare to have a rom-com without many common clichés and the main characters actually use their brain.
Art 10/10: The art fits the story. Character designs are memorable. And the girls are cute. Enough said.
Sound 10/10: That ED at the end of eps 3 alone deserves a 10/10.
Character 10/10: Characters are relatable and very realistic. Shirogane Miyuki is from a poor family and has transferred into a school for rich kids and became the student council president due to hardwork. After developing his feelings for Shinomiya Kaguya, the daughter of the wealthiest group in Japan, he realized that confessing first would make him the weaker one in the relationship. Due to their major differences in background, the only way for him, a man, to gain any power in the relationship is for Kaguya to fall in love with him first. Characters aren't playing mind games with each other just because it's fun; they have their own reasons. They all have memorable design and unique personalities traits that makes them stand out among other rom-com characters, and are very likeable.
Enjoyment 10/10: Can't find anything negative to say about this anime.
Overall 9/10: I'm giving it a 9 for now because the anime is still ongoing. But if they adapted correctly by only leaving in the important chapters (coughtheconfessionarccough) then this will end up being 10/10.",9

                kaguya-sama:Love is war review ((spoilers free))
 Love is war is one of those animes ,that l never wanted to end. From it's serious death note like scenes to  it's out of place comical like moments, each and every interactions helps build the characters and the environment they live in.
   Characters fluidity:
one of the strong points of this show is the fluidity of it's characters. Characters can change from a serious to a funny stance almost instantly , this especially appealed to me because the cast felt real people instead of fictional characters. Another strong point in this show is voice acting, each
                  character voice is acted in a way fitting of his/her background. 
   Arcs placement:
although this is a 12ep anime it still felt like a bunch of smaller nonessential arc clued together in order to form a tangible story line. Some episodes had two separate story lines ,which indeed helped keep the story fresh and covey their day to day school life, but failed to achieve satisfaction of ""seeing through it all"" feeling l get whenever l watch long story arcs.
   Genre diversity:
love is war can be listed almost in any (main) genre in anime from psychological to comedy. This diversity makes it easy for someone to recommend it to his family and friends and can be a great introduction into the anime world
      Final thoughts:
If you are looking for a feel good and funny anime mixed in with death note style psychology stand outs and an ending that will make you confess your love to the first girl you see in street l would highly recommend kaguya-sama.  8.7/10
~DISCLAIMER THIS IS MY OPINION AND MY OPINION ALONE~",9
"
                Hilarious skits combined with gorgeous visuals, perfectly chosen supporting music, cuteness I've never before seen and the best supporting character in anime ever.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War has officially convinced me to start watching romcom anime. MAL user watzitoya describes the characters as: Yagami and L from Death Note reincarnated into a romcom. I have to say, that’s very accurate.
The skits contain a perfect mix of intense moments and lightheartedness. I don’t know how to say this, but this shit’s cute man. It pulls on your heartstrings and makes you ache for a special someone. Kaguya’s design is simply amazing. So incredibly elegant. The same goes
                  for Chika, who makes my heart happy with her simple character, good heart, and not to mention her dancing skills. The small cast really works well here.
The anime also contains moments that are simply beautiful. The title scene of the final episode for example. I’d have liked for the season to have ended at that very moment, followed by a title drop and a period of silence. Nevertheless, amazing.
The only things I disliked was the wiener scene. I found it slightly out of taste and not in the spirit of the anime.
I highly recommend Love Is War to anyone who’s looking for cuteness and comedy. 9.5/10",10
"
                Ah, the will-they-won't-they romantic comedy. A classic and familiar trope, a story told many times before. But what happens when you infuse this story archetype with two fiercely intelligent characters, both madly in love with each other but are too prideful to admit it, and then you have those characters constantly duel each other in a battle of wits to trap the other person into confessing their love first? Well what you get is an excellent anime called Kaguya-sama: Love is War.
This show features a fantastic protagonist duo. Shinomiya and Shirogane (the ones whose love are kept secret from each other) are initially shown to
                  be nothing more than arrogant, top of the class student body bourgeoisie types. Their initial motivations seem to derive from nothing more than pride. But as the anime progresses, you get to see them in a variety of scenarios, both in dealing with each other but also just living their day to day life. It is in these different scenarios that we see the different layers and the depths contained within Shinomiya and Shirogane. You start to see them not as the hoity toity smarty pants they were initially presented as, but as regular kids with perfectly normal insecurities. They become highly relatable people that you end up rooting for more and more as the show progresses. 
The rest of the cast is rounded out nicely with supporting characters that show different perspectives on Shinomiya and Shirogane. They are all important in their own way, though none are worth mentioning more than Fujiwara and Ishigami. Fujiwara acts as the wild card, and often throws a wrench into our main' duo's plans, often to comedic effect. Ishigami is your typical introvert nerd that is constantly embarrassing himself, though will sometimes act to the benefit of the others. These two are lovable in their own way and are able to mix things up with the show's formula through entertaining and sometimes unexpected means.
Perhaps this show's greatest accomplishment is that it's genuinely hilarious. Each episode features typically normal and benign situations, that are elevated to comedic heights thanks to the animation, writing, and directing. These regular situations become battles of the gods, played out in the battlefield of the minds of Shinomiya and Shirogane. The ridiculousness of it all coupled with the crazy animation make for jokes that seem to stick the landing every single time.
Overall, it's a fresh take on romantic comedies that is done very well. You've got lovable characters and funny ass writing, and that's all I personally ask for in a show like this. Kaguya-sama: Love is War is definitely one this year's greatest releases.",9
"
                This anime deserves all the hype and praise it has gotten.
The show pretends to take itself very seriously, which confused me while diving in to episode 1 totally blind. Once I figured out that it was comedic, I started to really enjoy it. The concept of two lovers not admitting their feelings to each other would normally frustrate me. I want things to have a happy ending, and fast. However, this show does something different that only made me want to keep watching. 
First off, the comedy is spot on. The narrator is fantastic and pushes the jokes above and beyond. The airheaded secretary Chika
                  (a character type that would normally just annoy me) is fantastic at somehow constantly getting in the way. She is an oblivious bystander to extremely tense situations.
I thought the gag would get old, but each new episode proved me wrong. The show kept delivering new situations that never failed to get a laugh out of me. 
However, comedy is only half the battle in a RomCom.
The show is lighthearted and funny most of the time- but when it's time to get serious it does not fail. 
The sad moments are there with purpose. They help to amplify the payoffs. 
The happy moments are glorious and tear-jerking. 
The real romance and inner thoughts of the characters is everything I want from a romance anime.
The character backstories help in justifying the situation. They are very well developed right off the bat and continue to grow throughout the show. I'm always rooting for all the characters. They can be both hilarious and grounded. Even though this show is a parody of sorts, they still allow the characters to play in to the cliche sometimes. This creates dynamic characters who I would still watch even if they were all separated. 
The art is dramatic. The sound is dramatic. They serve the comedy when the time is right, but also create some tense moments and satisfying payoffs. The OP is also a certified banger.
Overall: Can't wait for season 2. I started reading the manga. Send help.",10
"
“Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-Tachi no Renai Zunousen” or more commonly known as “Kaguya-sama, Love Is War” is a comedy/romance show with a tiny bit of… psychological warfare. Would I recommend it? Hell yeah! 
TL;DR Kaguya-Sama Love Is War is basically what you would get if Light Yagami and L from Death Note tried to make the other confess to them instead of trying to kill each other. For the most part, it’s light-hearted but what really sets it apart from other comedy shows are the scenes where you see our two main characters duke it out in a battle of wits to try to somehow
                  “win” at love. Good character writing and a simplistic story really pushes the focus on the characters and what they’re doing making the whole experience enjoyable 
Story: 8 The story is mostly fine with little shortcomings when it comes to the start and has a short sequence reminiscent of “Daily Lives of High School Boys” 
Even though I gave the story section an 8, I believe that for the most part, the plot stays relevant with some side stories going on in the background to spice things up. However, I gave it an 8 for two main reasons, one of which is the fact that sometimes one of the shorts will start seemingly in the middle of an event as if the beginning wasn’t interesting enough and they decided to just remove it entirely. The other reason is that I personally don’t like the “three short stories”  per episode way of storytelling (I know the manga chapters weren’t long enough to make every episode equate to one or two chapters it’s just how I feel). Other than those two things, it’s nothing but good things, however, it’s not the main event (that belongs to its characters) it does its job and it does it well.
Art: 8 Kaguya has the largest range of emotions on any character I’ve ever seen in my life 
I have to say, A-1 Pictures hit it out of the park when it came to facial expressions and animations. Not to say anything else was lacking, everything looked superb and the animation never really felt stiff at all, everyone who worked on this definitely worked hard and I really have to give credit to them. While nothing was lacking, it doesn’t really hold a candle to the animation powerhouse of Mob Psycho this season, it’s still solid in its own right.
Sound 8: The ending went beyond most memes and became a fucking masterpiece 
HOT DOG was the opening and ending SUPERB in this anime, other than that, except for a couple of songs the rest of the soundtrack was relatively tame, nothing really stuck out for me as a really important and game-changing song. I’m not trying to underplay the musical achievement of the show but you can tell the music wasn’t the forefront. The voice acting on the other hand… was a MASTERPIECE, virtually every voice actor fit their character to a T.
Character: 10…
I don’t even know where to begin with this one… There is a certain depth to every character that makes them feel more realistic than most other romcoms in anime. With the “three stories per episode” thing going on, there really isn’t enough room for a more casual approach to character development but it really doesn’t matter since their interactions are deliberate and bring out everything you need to know. I know I’m biased since I binged the manga and I’m probably mixing it up with the anime but at least we know that it was a good adaptation if I’m able to confuse them this much. I can’t say too much without spoiling but just know that the characters REALLY drives this show home.
Enjoyment 10 
Overall: 8.8 -->9
Yeah, it’s a 9… not much to say here but I really recommend it to any comedy fans out there... All 7 billion of you.",9
"
                An absolutely brilliant anime comes to a close. An absolute treat to see this work done such justice in it's anime. One of my favorite manga has turned into one of the best romcom anime I've ever seen. Had me rolling so much and weezing with laughter pretty much every week and had all the heart in the world. The early bits might've been all comedy but these past few dialed up the emotion and got me good all over again. The writing is just so rich and feeds into its strong characters. The parts at the end we got for more cohesive story beats
                  and when it was wrapped up with Kaguya herself at the end worked really well. 
The characters were absolutely the main attraction too. Our main four were all such a good character to follow with the supporting cast being just as strong. Ishigami was my absolute favorite but Kaguya, Miyuki, and Chika all had such well done characterization and focus. Each time we got character moments for them it made me so happy. With the Hayasaka and Kei and others sprinkled in for even more fun. These characters all gave me laughs and pulled at my heart. 
The other main star of this anime other than the characters was the direction and production. Cause by God did this show have flair. A1 bringing that glory once again with the incredible adaptation going above and beyond even the manga at some spots. The creativity of how the skits were displayed with the visual humor along with the stellar voice acting and just all around performances elevated the hell out of this too. 
Overall I couldn't gush enough about this show. One of the best romcom anime I've seen as I said but just has that thing that can get into my heart. Such a fun time. Cast is a hell of an ensemble. Had a blast

                One day, Death Note and a Rom-Com had a love child featuring two tsunderes in love. It came to be known as “Kaguya-Sama: Love is War.” But is it a good anime? Delve right into this review to find out!
Plot- 7/10
Every episode goes as follows: Both Kaguya and Miyuki are generic tsunderes, however, they constantly attempt to trick the other into confessing their love. All the while Chika is used as a sort of wildcard between the two. 
The first few episodes are brilliant as they take a comedical approach to the intense mind games commonly seen in Death Note. As far as Rom-Coms go,
                  this is a truly unique concept that’ll keep you enthralled throughout every episode.(Except the French scene, we don’t talk about that.)
Characters- 3/10
While Chika is an incredible example of comic relief done right, Kaguya and Miyuki are completely generic tsunderes with little originality. As these two have the most screen time, I feel that Kaguya-Sama is lacking when it comes to character quality.
Art- 7/10
The mind games between Kaguya and Miyuki are intense thus they need exceptional animation to assist in making them interesting. Kaguya-Sama is no slouch when it comes to animation nonetheless, since I was mildly impressed by each episode’s animation. On top of this, the Episode 3 ED blew me away completely! This alone already gives Kaguya an 8.
Sound- 4/10
In contrast the excellent animation, I found that there were no notable tracks whatsoever in this anime. The Episode 3 ED provides some redemption, however.
Enjoyment- 7/10
Despite being Kaguya-Sama’s only gimmick, it succeeds in keeping you on the edge of your seat in anticipation of either Kaguya, Miyuki, or Chika’s next move in any of the mind battles. It was really fun to watch, and that’s what mostly matters for a Rom-Com such as Kaguya-Sama.
Overall- 7/10
This anime excells exceptionally in some areas but flukes terribly in others. I can recommend Kaguya-Sama: Love is War to any Rom-Com enthusiasts or even fans of Death Note for that matter. Anyway, this concludes the review.",7
"
                This is the first show that I have given all 10's I to be completely honest am not 100% percent why but I have never enjoyed a show more then this one. I found it by pure accident as someone made a meme with it on reddit and I didn't get the joke, so as any sane man I at once binge watched every single episode back to back not even stoping to eat. But now as to why I think I like the show so much. First I think the conflict is actually one that most people find themselves in often in anime conflicts
                  tend to be very grand in scale and that has gotten somewhat old so it is very refreshing to have a conflict that may seem trivial to many be so exciting this is very refreshing. I also found the characters to be very grounded and real me being a college student I find that relationships are very hard to navigate and it often does feel like a war. Many people say that the characters internal monolagues are over the top, and I would have to disagree because I find myself monolaguing to myself about how to proceed with a relationship quite often. So basically I think this anime is the best thing invented since anime.
P.S. If it matters I mainly watch action fantasy type stuff i've only watched a couple romance anime.",10
"
                Kaguya is an episodic comedy of two too-smart-for-their-own-good high schoolers dancing around each other and making elaborate plans to make the other confess their feelings. I like the premise and the characters are okay. However, the narrator is downright obnoxious and ruins the comedy for me.It constantly interrupts the action to explain the obvious and repeats itself as if the viewers had the memory of a goldfish. The silly over-the-top tone is already conveyed through the main pair's inner thoughts - there's no need for a narrator to handhold us through what's happening.
The only good thing I can say about the narrator is that it
                  gets less chatty in the later episodes. Unfortunately those episodes also feature high school drama, which I couldn't bring myself to care about.",5
"
                Kaguya sama Love is War is a comedy anime and very funny. This anime is not only funny but very enjoyable. All the characters are hilarious in their own way and the story's between them trying to get each other to confess their love is really interesting. Their techniques are quite smart and sometimes when it doesn't work it's really funny. It always has you on the edge of you seat if they are going to confess their love to each other. And it sometimes leaves you a little bit disappointed when they are about to confess but they don't but you still get excited
                  to see what they do next to get each others attention.
The characters of Kaguya Sama Love is War are Kaguya Shinomiya, Miyuki Shirogane, Chika Fujiwara and Yuu Ishigami. 
Kaguya Shinomiya is the Vice president of the Student council and is trying to get Miyuki Shirogane to confess his love to her. She is quite shy around Miyuki Shirogane but she is quite stern to others. She has a maid named Ai Hayasaka who basically does everything for her.
Miyuki Shirogane is the President of the stundent council and is also trying to get Kaguya Shinomiya to confess her love to him. He is a very hard worker and goes by a strict routine. Miyuki Shirogane has a younger sister named Kei Shirogane. He is a very chill dude and is very smart getting the highest grade in everything.",10
"
                The synopsis and even the title of this anime throw out the word ""genius"" regarding the two main characters. After watching this anime, that description certainly doesn't apply. In fact, both Shirogane and Shinomiya are dumbasses- But it's so much better this way.
Kaguya-sama: Love is war is essentially a bunch of comedy skits about Miyuki Shirogane- the student council president and Kaguya Shinomiya- the vice president attempting to ""outsmart"" each other and force the other into a situation where they'd be forced to confess their feelings. Since ""Love is war"" and whoever confesses first loses, neither will move an inch, thus the story makes little
                  progress. However, as Kaguya-sama: Love is war is one of the funniest anime I've ever watched, this means nothing. 
The skits of Kaguya-sama: Love is war are consistently funny- rarely ever was I disappointed. The primary reason for this was the strength of the core cast. Each of the five main characters never fails to make each interaction between the characters hilarious, but even more than that, the presence of a Narrator adds to this anime in a way I didn't expect. Much of this anime's content is not verbal, rather in the minds of the characters. The existence of a Narrator completely remedies this issue, but it wouldn't have been nearly as brilliant if the voice acting performance wasn't so good.
The art and animation of Kaguya-sama: Love is war is very good. The overall level of detail wasn't the best (outside the board room) but they did a great job capturing the expressions of the characters. Not the best this season, but consistently high quality, as expected from A-1. The soundtrack is great, it definitely added to my experience. The voice acting is what truly stands out though. Very impressive performances from the entire main cast.
The success of a comedy anime hinges on whether it's actually funny or not, and for this anime, that depends on how seriously you view it. If you take all the ""Love is war"" nonsense completely seriously, you probably won't enjoy this anime nearly as much as those who just laughed at the hilarious immaturity of the main characters. Overall Kaguya-sama: Love is war is a solid 9 in my book, and undoubtedly a strong contender for comedy AOTY.",9
"
                Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai – (Anime season 1 & 2)
Out of 100 Nobles watching…
95 were impressed!
5 didn’t like certain character dynamics or fake drama
Let me just lay this out as quickly as I can. In short, watch Kaguya. It’s good. 
Kaguya-sama Love is War is a romcom anime, and pitched flat the premise is something I am definitely not about. When it was initially airing my friend group had me watch a random episode or two, and at the time all I saw was a very typical “rich girl and rich boy can’t admit they like each other and act way too stupid to be believable”
                  story. I was wrong, I was VERY wrong, and I will declare from every rooftop I can that Kaguya is a hilarious comedy and moving drama. 
Talking to my most recent victim-er I mean friend that I’ve gotten to start Kaguya; I went down the exact same mental path when I began the show. The comedy is enjoyable, the interactions between characters is very good, and the self-awareness of the narrator and the show is well adapted from the source material, but the bit does feel like it will get old. Class President Miyuki and Vice President Kaguya have a back and forth where they can’t ask each other out and I can say that with two seasons of show that doesn’t change too much. That can and should feel frustrating and it takes a bit of meta-knowledge about where the manga goes to know that the show pays off. 
A lot of bits and gags repeat themselves, but they don’t overstay their welcome. For example, every Fujiwara/Shirogane training arc is fantastic. Other shows like Hinamatsuri show that repetition of a gag is an art not easily mastered. The bits didn’t really get old to me and character development of the main cast and introduction of new cast members shores up the fact that the main characters confessing to each other risks ending the show. 
The show takes some pretty overly serious tones at times, and it’s more manipulative on the shows part making situations feel more serious than they are. One scene in particular from season two felt right out of some crazy hentai revenge doujin. That is to say, I mean the content is not explicit, but it was more of a “this kind of thing only happens in a bizzarro hentai world” kind of feeling. That scene leads to some of the best character development in the series so I won’t harp on it.
Aoi Koga had done very few other lead roles before taking on the mantle of Kaguya, and it’s a damn shame because she is phenomenal. The range she shows in her role is incredible and her picking up a number of new lead roles in recent years are proof of the quality she’s displayed. The rest of the sound design in Kaguya is incredible and the great OP’s, ED’s, Narration, and characters all work with the wonderful animation quality of the show to deliver a product that pairs perfectly as a gateway to the source. 
Very little of the Kaguya manga has really been adapted. Do yourself a favor. Watch this excellent piece of art, get the character voices burned in your brain, and pick up the manga and sacrifice your next day or two to the dark anime gods catching up to wait for weekly chapters like the rest of us.",10
"
                Kaguya-Sama: Love Is War is one of the most frustrating anime I've ever watched.
Minor Spoilers below: the show barely has a plot, but just warning you!
The premise of two genius students, Kaguya and Shirogane, at an elite high school using psychological warfare to force the other to confess is so promising. And for the most part the first couple episodes deliver on this premise with dramatic narration, great comedic timing, and snappy animation. Taking the mental gymnastics present in Death Note, Kakegurui, and other ""psychological"" shows and applying them to something as mundane as high school romance seems like a brilliant commentary on teenage melodrama
                  while providing an effective subtext about the importance of emotional vulnerability.
If the show had ended some 5 episodes in I might have given it an 8 honestly, but by the mid-point of the season this concept feels like beating a dead horse. The initial enjoyment and comedic spectacle of their relationship quickly loses its luster and side characters like Chika and Ishigami's one-note personalities can only go so far.
What were once battles of wit that involved thought on behalf of both our protagonists became just sloppy unclear conflicts. At the end of each section of an episode it seemed like the narrator just arbitrarily chose who won or even what the conflict was in the first place. The other issue this causes is that Kaguya and Shirogane begin the series seemingly aware that the other likes them and using these battles to encourage the other to confess. By the end of the season the two have been drained of all their confidence and now barely have faith that the other likes them.
Don't get me wrong I appreciate the subtext that these two characters are not actually confident about love, or flirting, or even comfortable with themselves as people. When all the subtlety of this concept is drained away and we see our protagonists crying in their rooms about each other it seems like we have completely abandoned anything that made this show unique or funny or intriguing. What began as a show about a battle of wits with a subtext of teenage insecurity ends as any other run of the mill romance anime that ends with all the characters coming together to watch the summer fireworks.  If this were anymore cliché, we would have had the fireworks drowning out Shirogane's confession. 
I really, really wanted to love this show I think the concept behind it and the subtext it creates are a brilliant idea, but at the end of the day the show leans so far into its subtext of repressed emotions that it just becomes a generic anime romcom. Why was it important that they go to an elite school? Why does it matter that Kaguya is extremely wealthy? How does Shirogane deal with the insecurity of being a ""commoner?"" All of these elements, including the show's selling point, that could have given the show and its comedy some depth are abandoned. At the end of the season we have Kaguya reaffirming her goal from the first episode to make Shirogane confess and it feels like groundhog day. This show has so much potential and it makes me sad to see it squandered. I really hope season 2 managed to turn things around.",5

Love is War
Love is War
Love is Waaar.............................
Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen or in English  Kaguya Wants to be Confessed To: The Geniuses' War of Love and Brains, in most rom com one would find the guy annoying when he's very oblivious to the girl's feelings , but here you'd be annoyed by two main characters who knows one has feeling for each other , but the hold up, was that each neither admits it nor any of them makes any move to express it thoroughly. So yes Love is war for
                  these 2 but in a very corny way, where it was more like a reverse cold war where one wouldn't make a move thinking that the other one is gonna be cold and condescending, so yes both parties were annoying that one would wanna go up there and tell the two to stop pretending to be cold and just warm up and tell each other that you guy love each other, cu'z I kinda want to do that when I watch this, the only relief that one can get here is the bubbly and lively  Fujiwara, Chika, who provides the ice breaker and some comedic part around here.... too bad she can't play cupid for the two alpha dogs. So how do I see this?:
Story- Very Good 8: It wasn't always that we get to have a plot where two alpha dogs like each other but neither have the guts to confess to each other, let alone be honest with each other. 
Art- Poor 3: I don't like the girls school uniform and seriously does  Shirogane, Miyuki have to be in a complete Gakuran even in summer and during the summer  fireworks display? 
Sound - poor 3: Well Shinomiya, Kaguya , Shirogane, Miyuki, Hayasaka, Ai and Ishigami, Yuu all sounded like they're 40. Only  Fujiwara, Chika sounded like a teenager. 
Character- Dreadful 2: It is bad enough when in a usual rom com the guy would be annoying for being oblivious to a girls feelings , but here having two people whom were on the top of the student hierarchy, who can seem to be honest with each other for fearing the one would  receive such cold reaction from each other was way too annoying , and like I've said only Fujiwara provides most the comic part of this anime and so as Ishigami, Yuu who has to take all the punches around here. 
Enjoyment- Very Good 8: It maybe annoying that there were two annoying alpha dogs who can be honest with each other here like  Shinomiya, Kaguya and  Shirogane, Miyuki, but then again this is annoyingly very good to watch. 
Overall- Very good 8: Basically not your typical romcom , so kudos to studio  A-1 Pictures and original creator Akasaka, Aka.",8
"
                I recommend this anime especially if you're lonely and have a crush one someone. I like this anime because it gives different vibes than any other romance anime. The characters are trying to keep it cool in front of their crush, but their mind is like a war, the way they tried to calculate each moves and tried to sparks confession is too much of a calculus, it portrays how extremely complicated and twisted to be in love in funny and interesting way hahaha... which is true, isn't teenage love is weird and complicated? Yeah, if you're curious about it, just watch it!",9
"
                TL;DR – A masterfully crafted, funny, and fresh take on young-love
Disclaimer: Comedy being what it is means that you may simply find this show un-funny and it can’t be helped, so take all that you read with a grain of salt. Also beware of minor “spoilers.”
Right out of the gate the premise of two tsundere types trying to make one another confess their love is fairly limited in its scope and it takes a good director and an even better writer to make it work. So it’s no faint praise when I say the writers did an excellent job and managed to keep the show
                  fresh and entertaining over the course of this 12 episode season. The show never felt like it was repeating itself or like it ran out of ideas (something I notice lots of similar shows suffer from), always finding new angles to tackle its subject from and/or different situations to put its characters in. 
In episode 6, right in the middle of the season as a faint sense of monotony started to creep in for me the show introduced a small cast of new characters that helped keep the same energy and quality through the second half of the season. Even then the writers were careful not to fall for the “more characters are better” fallacy. The show works as well as it does because we as an audience are allowed the breathing room to really understand and observe this small nuclear cast. It also helps that the characters are interesting people with relatable personalities that actually change and develop over the course of the season. 
It may sound pretentious to talk about things like characterisation in a rom-com anime but this show really hits the nail on its head. There are no useless or annoying characters; neither are there any obvious fan-service characters that were shoe-horned in to sell box-sets (not counting Chika who is infinitely more interesting than your typical cute poster-girl). The show has a small, tightly-knit cast of characters that it uses appropriately and sparingly.
Looking underneath the layer of comedy we find that this show has a decent love story as its main narrative. Towards the end of the season we watch as it seamlessly transitions in and out of gags and the underlying romance plot which you didn’t even realize you were invested in until then.
However the climax of the show will leave many viewers disappointed as what felt like a wonderful narrative bow to tie everything together unfortunately leads in for a second season instead. Also the last two episodes were a bit of a narrative mess with many false stops, that is to say it felt like the show was coming to an end but then kept going some more. There was also the odd choice to put the setup for the final episode after the end credits of episode 11 which I would’ve easily missed hadn’t I checked the time remaining before clicking ‘next;’ viewers beware.
Looking at the technical side of things the show ticks all the boxes; it’s aesthetically pleasing to look at with consistently well-done, quality animation and memorable character designs with well-chosen colour palettes. I also note the very sly and expert use of 3D CGI here and there which does nothing but add to the experience. I particularly liked the use of patterns and stencils typically seen in manga and thought they worked very well. Also the background extras were drawn in surprising detail which is always welcome. 
The music and sound effects while not outstanding do a fine job as well. The voice acting, however, was some of the best I’ve heard this season. The characters’ voices seemed to fit them so well and were highly expressive, elevating the show to a whole new level.
With all that said what good is a comedy if the jokes aren’t funny? Luckily, Kaguya-sama is hilarious all throughout. Again, I must remind you of the disclaimer at the start of this review and how when I say this show was funny I really mean that I personally found it funny, YMMV but I reckon most people can at least get a few chuckles out of this show. At its core the show’s comedy stems from the sheer absurdity of the main characters’ elaborate back-and-forth mind games. It was a bittersweet experience watching them voice the same painfully stupid thoughts that you, the viewer, may have had in the past about love or relationships; it certainly made me (rather uncomfortably) reflect on the past and on myself in between jokes. 
I must admit there were a handful of jokes whose punch-lines were painfully predictable and fell flat on their face as a result. However, those few failures were well drowned-out by the rest of the laughter I had while watching.
Final verdict: WELL WORTH THE WATCH
I was very sceptical at first when I read the show’s synopsis because it sounded like your typical shitty high-school rom-com anime. Then when I started watching I was sure the gimmick would quickly wear-off and start to annoy me. Imagine my surprise when the show proved me wrong both times! This is no comedy genius like [your favourite show] but it serves as excellent light-hearted entertainment and was genuinely fun to watch. A solid show overall; it’s got my recommendation for all that’s worth.
EDIT: I feel the need to elaborate on some of the points I made:
1) Chika is more than your average SNS-bait cute girl
2) Characters in the show develop and grow
I've read a few reviews who claim that the only reason why this show received any praise was because of the character of Chika and that she was just another poster girl. I disagree because while she initially comes off as an airhead her character is given lots of unexpected twists and turns. She's shown to have relatively bizarre interests such as hiking and board games compared to her counterparts in other shows who have no interests or personality what-so-ever. She's also shown to be imperfect and actually cunning in several episodes where she cheats at games to have her way, deceive and trick others, or is selfish; unusual traits for your typical cute airhead. Yes, I realize now she is a very popular character and probably something the producers wanted precisely for SNS clout but that's not her sole purpose so I am able to tolerate this.
Another common sentiment I found was that the characters are flat and static. I couldn't disagree more here. As the show goes on we see the two main characters fall even more deeply in love with one another as they progress through the various stages of courtship. Two people who until then didn't even talk (as shown in flashbacks and told in voice-over narration) exchange phone numbers, visit each other's homes, start meeting outside of school, get more involved with one another's families, and finally during the climax overcome a major obstacle together which strengthens their bond. I especially look at Kaguya's character for examples of development. She initially wants to subordinate Miyuki but grows to want to be equal lovers by the finale. She comes to realize -with the help of Ai saying it directly in episode 11, the running gag couple by acting as a proxy to their relationship and a base for Kaguya to compare herself to, and the ticking-clock element of her strict family who try and separate the two in episode 12- that the pointless games they play are not leading anywhere and decides to take initiate in some areas, for example being the first to follow Miyuki on Twitter or running away from home to be with him. Still I agree the fact that the show ends with that tie-in for a second season does no help this as it seemingly resets their relationship however I can't comment because I haven't seen the second season; maybe the events of the first season have a lasting impact that carries over, I can only hope.",9
"
                Let's jump onto it:
Story: Basic but solid plot: Two school students love each other but they're too prideful to confess. For the whole anime the protagonists will use their big brain to devise plan after plan to force the lover to confess.
Art: Nice and steady art style and smooth and simple animation. Straight to the point.
Sound: I love you mistaa,  ♭ ♭ ♭ ♭oohh mistaa ♭ ♭ ♭
Character: Recognizable and well characterized cast. Chica is annoying, but the author has the good sense to dispose her quickly, especially in S2.
Overall: Give it a try, even I was skeptic at first, but I assure you
                  it's a hella ride if you want to have fun.
No it's not Death Note RomCom version, you'll be disappointed if you're looking for that.",9
"
                Story: 9/10
Shuchiin Academy, a top-rated school where most of the story action happens and where we follow Kaguya and Shirogane, the student body's representatives in a fight to make each other succumb to their plans and confess their love. A simple plot but it will yield some great moments and even when the episode is just about the council day by day life, it will have some memorable moments that you will enjoy and remember. 
Art/Animation: 10/10
I challenge anyone to send me one comedy anime with low to no action at all with better animation than this anime. In fact, the third episode end was
                  what made me first try this anime and what anime, the animation is clean, the camera movements are great, I only have congrats to give to the anime director for this piece of art, and if you still have any doubt try to read the manga and you will notice the magic a great director can make.
Sound: 10/10
This anime soundtrack is fantastic. The opening is incredible such as the ending being fantastic even as standalone music, better than that just the soundtrack that you ear to create and reinforce the scene mood.
Characters: 10/10
If you don't love the characters, this is not the anime for you. The characters in this show are so different from each other and have a personality so complete and distinct. For example, Chika, the funny one always happy trying to bring joy to the group, contrasting with Ishigami, the depressed gamer/otaku with antisocial problems. In some episodes bringing even secondary characters with personalities that contrast so much with our main characters giving us the sensation of diversity and a ""real school"" environment.
Enjoyment: 10/10
""Love is War"" it's so funny. The episodic style of the anime is funny and gives a variety of episodes for everyone's tastes with little things that make us feel the progression until the moment the plot thickens but making you end all episodes with a smile on your face.
Overall: 10/10
The pinnacle of comedy and production all together for our enjoyment and the best part a little thing to everyone so a must to watch for every anime fan.",10

                ""If a tsundere and a tsundere liked each other, would they ever find out?"" - Gigguk
Honestly, this quote is what drew me into the 3d chess, battle royale, Deathnote style love game that Kaguya-sama portrays. Possibly the best romantic comedy to have ever been released in anime, Kaguya-sama's jokes and music complement the absurdity that is high school romance dramas. 
Kaguya-sama is about the game of love, where the most mundane of stakes are treated with the importance placed on them by the most intense of high school students. The battle of wits is narrated with the gravity of life or death - bolstering every
                  comedic moment and punch line.
Honestly, the only thing even resembling a blemish comes across more as a nitpick - the animation can be a bit dizzying at times with the amount of special effects. Especially during the first season. This is not an anime for first-time anime watchers, but those seasoned in reading complex subtitles and familiar with romantic comedies in anime in general.
10/10 - This is a must see for any anime fan.",10
"
                My dear Kaguya-sama, your start was so troubled, it seemed like you wanted to use different shapes of different anime while looking for your rhythm, trying to make a parody with the slow romance genre. And during episode three you found, mixing the drama with a genius comedy (I think we should thank Chika for the incredible ending of this episode). After this, Kaguya-sama only improved, introducing a very charismatic character, Ishigami-kun, do not die. Another point to emphasize are the other characters that appear in the work, all contribute in some way to the plot of the anime, to the secondary characters, like the
                  Kaguya maid who always manages to help her ""hime"", to the boy who will ask Shirogane for advice on how to ask a girl to date, until that same girl goes to Kaguya to ask how to end the relationship with this boy. And speaking of the devil, MIYUKI SHIROGANE, as I LOVED this protagonist, he always faced a Kaguya who was always ahead of him with plans and strategies to place him against the wall. But he always found a way around the situation. What made me sad was the anti-climax of the half in the last episode, could have ended in an exciting scene like the one that had occurred in the first half. But what we learn from Kaguya-sama is something I'm going to take as a lesson: Love is War. (I apologize for my spelling mistakes)
(PT-Br) Minha querida Kaguya-sama, o seu inicio foi tão conturbado, parecia que você queria usar de várias formas de animes diferentes, enquanto procura o seu ritmo, tentando fazer uma paródia com o gênero de romance lento. E durante o episódio três você encontrou, misturando o drama com uma comédia genial (acho que devemos agradecer a Chika pela ending incrível desse episódio). Após isso, Kaguya-sama só melhorou, introduzindo um personagem muito carismático, Ishigami-kun, não morra. Outro ponto a ressaltar são os outros personagens que aparecem na obra, todos contribuem de alguma forma para o plot do anime, até os personagens secundários, como a empregada da Kaguya que sempre dá um jeito de ajudar sua ""hime"", até o garoto que vai pedir conselhos para Shirogane de como pedir uma garota em namoro, até essa mesma garota ir a Kaguya para perguntar como terminar o relacionamento com esse garoto. E falando no diabo, MIYUKI SHIROGANE, como eu AMEI esse protagonista, ele sempre enfrentava uma Kaguya que estava sempre a frente dele com planos e estratégias para coloca-lo contra parede. Mas sempre dava um jeito de contornar a situação. O que me deixou triste foi o anti-clímax da metade no ultimo episódio, podia ter terminado em uma cena emocionante como a que tinha ocorrido na primeira metade. Mas o que aprendemos com Kaguya-sama é algo que eu vou levar como uma lição: Love is War.",9
"
                Not bad, not bad. Not great but not bad. While yes I did rate this an 8 because its not bad at all. Its always fun to watch a fun romance anime. While the thought is, ""Wow two tsundere characters"" it really comes off as two normal high schoolers. They are new to the situation of love and with their quirks comes this battle of confession. Each episode is introducing each battle and watching it unravel. While this anime didn't stand out as anything special, it had some waifu material. Short review is short. This anime is quick, funny, and cute.

                As this is coming 8 months after actually watching the show, this review will concentrate on the overall lasting impression it gave. This implies what essence of the anime that may stay with a viewer over time. 
Kaguya-sama: Love is War, as with its title, begins pretty straightforwardly with the premise that whomever confesses to their possible romantic interest first will lose the ""game of love."" The story delves into the Gary Stu of a Student Council president and the Mary Sue of a Vice, who both assume that they are in such a war. 
Given their ridiculous ""perfect"" abilities, such as physical giftedness, genius
                  (to the point of ignorance, if you know what I mean), leadership, manipulativeness, etc., one can only take the characters by face value. It was very funny and crazy to view their surface-level interactions.
The series portrays itself as episodic, day-to-day experiences, not following a clear build-up or storyline. Their exaggerated qualities during these different scenarios are fun to relate to as a hyperbole. This is fine, but does not allow a deep connection with the audience. 
On the latter part, and all of a sudden, if I may add, the format of the series takes a turn from slice-of-life to have more of a plot. Out of the blue, the history of a character is shown, that character's development takes place, and the narrative is propelled forward. The dynamics of the president and vice president takes a 180 degree turn. Though this change was entertaining, it was too abrupt to be fully appreciated. 
Well, disjointed as Kaguya-sama may have been, I have to admit that it was enjoyable enough and I am looking forward to what happens next.",7
"
                Kaguya-Sama: Love is War is a show that takes the scenario of prideful, insecure, overthinkers in love to the extreme. Some people have compared this, flatteringly, to Death Note which initially confused me. If anything, Love is War is taking the piss out of that show, demonstrating how absurd its portrayal of ""genius"" actually is.
Our core duo Miyuki and Kaguya's introduction is the first area where the show demonstrates itself as above average. We immediately get the impression that they are both intelligent, prideful and ironically want the same things from each other. It is already better here than most romance shows since we can
                  see almost immediately why they compliment each other and would be in love. The series early on takes care to give us some insight into what makes them tick. This is done utilising the narrator and visuals as a framing device for their thought process and having stories that focus on only one of them at a time. They both are ultimately insecure but compassionate people underneath their pride and neurotic tendencies. This characterisation dispels the first potential question of why there would be romantic tension in the first place.  Where Love is War falls behind a bit is in how it frames the main driving force of its comedy early on. We get the impression that much of the show will be around the battle of wits between Miyuki and Kaguya, which is only partially true. 
The initial tone is likely where the embarrassing impression that this is ""the Death Note of Romance"" or that ""side characters a are just one-dimensional punchline machines"" stem. The series's initial formula is that Miyuki and Kaguya, being chronic overthinkers, are battling it out, only for the others, namely Chika, to disrupt their plan with elements that they cannot account for. Some later stories revolve around a battle of their intellect, but most of the time, the punchline becomes the two's disastrous misreading of each other. Toward the end of the season, we come to see that this is not two just ""geniuses"" fighting it out for a contrived reason. They are two, unquestionably brilliant people, who are so deeply insecure that they are overthinking every bit of their interaction. Their insane and inane plotting stems from misreading the situation or imagining that the other is more condescending than they are. 
Love is War is lampooning Death Note's primary driving force, with how their characters can read and anticipate in absurd detail and accuracy. It would be more likely that over analysing and close to circular thinking would lead to categorical misreadings. So much of it relies on inferences built upon inferences that even one inaccuracy somewhere in the chain would produce a wrong and ridiculous conclusion. Death Note attempts to portray that seriously without any irony in its ""genius"" characters. Love is War satirises that idea with how off the mark Miyuki and Kaguya are, along with the additional neurosis that is a consequence of that kind of thinking. 
Accordingly, the show does its characters justice in fleshing them out, at least by a romantic comedy's standards. The background of Miyuki as self-made but still poor and Kaguya as rich but incredibly talented are expanded upon as the series goes. It becomes clear that despite their different backgrounds, it has produced a remarkably similar outlook. To them, everything is a competition and losing any amount of prestige would harm them tremendously. While the 'love is war' idea starts as a funny scenario, it is established why they would view it that way throughout the series. Despite their affection for each other, they cannot shake their deep-seated idea that the other person would look down on them because they have been conditioned to see it that way. By the end of the series, we delve further into why Kaguya, in particular, developed this personality. She almost cannot act any differently and be direct, or accept that Miyuki will not think less of her despite knowing his true feelings on an intellectual level.
The other members of our leading quartet are also further established as the series goes on. Chika early on is shown to at the very least have her suspicions that Miyuki and Kaguya are in love. This signals that while she can be rather naive or socially unaware, she is certainly not stupid. Her honesty about what she feels and wants is easy to mistake as being simple, especially relative to the brilliant Miyuki and Kaguya. It even gives some stories the undercurrent of her playing along or even orchestrating incidents to push them together. Though more so for her own gratification in the moment than any grand scheme. This development highlights that she is the foil for both Miyuki and Kaguya not just because she is just a force of chaos as it appears on the surface. She is fundamentally different from them, willing to be direct, which throws a wrench in their plans that hinge on proxying and mind games. Yuu is perhaps the weakest member of the main cast, mainly owing to his later introduction. He is the only character who can be considered genuinely paranoid, which pushes Miyuki and Kaguya's train of thought into overdrive with his suggestions. Aside from some insight into his personality as a repressed person, running his mouth off once he gets comfortable, not much else is done with him. However, this is adequate for the show and nothing to praise.
The directing, visuals and tone of Love is War are done perfectly. Initially, it was hard to grasp the OP's lustre due to the Death Note parody tone and framing of the show. However, as the season went on, and it became clear that Love is War was parodying the ""genius mental chess match"" idea, the opening visuals made more sense. The music by Masayuki Suzuki and the James Bond-esque, psychedelic parody opening sequence fit the tone of the series perfectly. If there is any show Love is War should be compared to, it is probably actually the ""Anti-Hyouka"". It is conceptually similar since they revolve primarily around their characters' thought processes instead of the actions' outcome. While Hyouka is a slow-placed, slice-of-life and mystery drama, Love is War is the inversion of this as an over the top, romantic comedy. To A-1 Picture's credit, they do a good job of animating the characters' imagination and thought process to significant comedic effect. Although it cannot compare to the polished visuals of KyoAni, they are still well done and effectively placed. 
The use of a narrator also helps set the tone and acts as the ""straight man"" in this comedy set up. It gives the series a similar atmosphere to the likes of Haruhi Suzumiya which utilises the caustic remarks of Kyon to frame the scenarios and as a reference point. Though the execution is far from perfect in Love is War, seeming to be off the mark on when to exaggerate the situation and when to undercut with dryness. While it is understandable that some would find it off-putting, it is difficult to imagine how the show would function without one as it was structured with that in mind. Simultaneously, no character in the cast is poised to narrate since none are the ""straight man"" of the group since there is humour in each of their perspectives.
Overall, Kaguya-Sama: Love is War is a solidly done Romance Comedy. Like most shows, it uses tropes and cliches as narrative shorthand to get its intent across quickly before digging down deeper to give them some substance. It has strong comedic timing all the way through and the visual creativity to back it up. While it falls short in getting across its precise tone in the first few episodes, it more than makes up for this once the realisation of what it is satirising sets in. It also feels somewhat spatially constrained, having few locations the characters interact in, though this is understandable for a comedy's first season. Perhaps it does not deserve to be given a 9 out of 10 just yet; though it is undeniable that it is at the very least a good show, far above the average. There is clear potential for the two leads to remain interesting and funny even after entering a relationship. This signals strongly constructed character dynamics which places it firmly as an 8 out of 10.",8
"
                Having read the manga up till its latest chapter, I am still fervently waiting for each week's upload of Kaguya-sama Love is War regardless of the fact that the anime is pretty much the same as the manga in terms of content, and I think that this hugely summarizes the boons of this anime. Despite the manga already being highly enjoyable, humorous and creative, the anime somehow manages to take this enjoyment to the next level by incorporating otherwise impeccable voice acting, animation and sound. Take for example the most recently released Episode 9. I have already read the manga (as mentioned above) and found
                  it to be one of the funnier chapters, but the anime adaptation manages to add so much more into what is otherwise already an extremely humorous comic chapter: Ishigami's voice character was impeccable at teasing Fujiwara, the funny scenes were amplified by the animation and smart addition of extra scenes (example: Hayasaka's not so subtle coercion for the President to do naughty things to Kaguya whilst sick) and etc. 
I have nothing to more to add other than the fact that similar to some other reviewers who watched the initial 2 to 3 episodes, I was slightly put off by the premise of the show: 2 smart tsundere characters trying to get each other to fall in love with each other via mind games, tricks etc. After all, it would make to be a very episodic anime + how much mind games and tricks can you possibly incorporate to make the anime ever the more engaging? Yet, having watched till the latest episode, I can only say that the enjoyment level just keeps on increasing, and I find myself deriving more and more fun and enjoyment from each subsequent uploaded episode. To conclude this otherwise lengthy review, JUST WATCH IT! Can assure you that you will have no regrets whilst watching each character's over-the-top antics at play which somehow organically blends together to give an outstanding romantic comedy, something that is not of the norm nowadays in the Rom Com genre.",10
"
                Comedy is incredibly subjective, so if you don't find this show funny, it simply isn't going to work for you, period. Personally, I found everything from the over-the-top narrator to the ridiculous physical comedy to the main characters' constant over-analyzing of the most basic situations to be hilarious. But where it really shines it when it takes itself more seriously and dives into the romantic side of the Romcom equation.
Some of the short skits that each episode are broken up into are obviously a little more serious in tone (the walk home, the umbrella, etc.) but the majority of them are pretty much straight comedy,
                  pitting Shirogane and Shinomiya against each other in a battle of the wits in an attempt to get the other to confess their interest, with Chika Fujiwara and Ishigami getting caught up in the crossfire. But even when they're being played almost solely for laughs, these setups do a really good job of blending in character development for everyone involved. When the show suddenly becomes much more dramatic in the last few episodes, culminating in the fantastic fireworks setpiece, it doesn't feel unearned or like a huge shift from the rest of the show. Instead, we've seen enough of these characters to sympathize with them and for the ending of that sequence to both make sense and be emotionally impactful. 
The last episode is where we see Shirogane and Shinomiya's ""relationship"" go from a fairly shallow attraction to something much deeper, bolstered by all the little character moments we've gotten along the way that reveal parts of their true personalities, not the facades they put up in an attempt to ""win"" whatever twisted game they're playing. When they realize that there's something deeper there, they are both terrified, comically so of course. And the ending, while remaining fairly open ended (and the source material has a lot more to offer from what I've heard), it's also satisfying on its own. They haven't ended up together yet, but at the end of the season, both Shirogane and Shinomiya are absolutely all in and will continue their battle until someone finally makes their confession. 
This is all supported by the dynamic and interesting animation, great music, constant onslaught of jokes that almost always land (for me at least), and lovable characters. It was a pleasure to watch and I'm excited and hopeful for more.",10
"
                Kaguya-sama is an over-the-top rom-com romp adapted from a manga of the same name. The anime covers Chapters 1-46 of the manga and excises a bit of the filler along the way. Not to worry though, the adapted chapters are adapted faithfully and take full advantage of the visual and audio capabilities of the medium. The OP deserves particular praise here, pulling off a James Bond-esque visual sequence with music to match. This is indicative of the anime's biggest strength, its ability to enhance top-notch source material through visual direction and musical accompaniment. The soundtrack here would not be out of place in an action
                  series and serves to highlight the silliness of the whole situation. Which of course is the entire point of the series. That's not to say this anime is without its serious or heartfelt moments. The general silliness provides the necessary contrast to highlight those dramatic moments and make them ring all the more true.
Voice acting is top-notch from start to finish. Everyone seems like they're having fun with their lines, but none more so than Yutaka Aoyama. His narrator is large, bombastic, and clearly enjoying the hell out of every single line he delivers.
The script is pretty tightly-written, but I do think there are some sections that could have been cut and others that could have been expanded on. For example, I think the end of Episode 11 could have been its own episode, relying on music and animation to make up for the short narration. Overall though, there's not a great deal of filler and even that filler is pretty enjoyable. 
The animation is consistently quality. It does take short-cuts here and there but I really didn't notice it until subsequent viewings of the episode. The Episode 3 ED is amazing and if you know nothing else about this anime, you've probably seen that clip floating around on YouTube already. 
Overall, this is an outstanding quality production. I enjoyed it for its characters, satirical humor, visual gags and Yutaka Aoyama's insane narration.",9
"
                SPOILERS:
Story 5/10:
The story follows two high schoolers, Kaguya and Miyuki- actually, there really is no story; like- zero. All it is is just two high school virgins who so DESPERATLEY love each other, but can never find the balls to just tell how they feel about each other. Instead, we get formulaic episodes on who ""wins or loses"". Plus funhee gags and jokes. Alright, let me just cut to the chase; the biggest problem with the anime is that we really get no type of character development - or any development at all between Kaguya and Miyuki. I don't understand what the hype is about
                  either for this anime. This is like every other generic rom-com but it DOES do some things differently e.g. modern words and such like ""braincells"" or ""cringe"". I don't really hear modern words in animes like that too often; so it was kind of a surprising. The show has its cute moments but that didn't redeem itself. Back to what I was talking about I was talking about with the character development. Again, there is NONE. In the last episode of the anime it had me. I was going to give it back a 7 because there was SOME hope but it let me down in the end. The narrator even says before the episode ends ""Aaaand their relationship is back to normal"" OF FUCKING COURSE IT IS. This is a generic rom-com that has its moments but absolutley no character development. Although this doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this anime, I'm very disappointed and I don't get why this show has many positive reviews. Am I not understanding something?  Anyways, moving on...
Art/Animation 7/10:
The art didn't look bad. There was some moments that made it shine and I appreciated. I really like Kaguya's eyes for example. But the art can also be generic - not bland - but generic at times. 
The animation was above average for me. But I wasn't paying too much attention to it. 
Sound 6/10:
The soundtrack was ok. Nothing of note. I think the opening was pretty good though. 
Nothing memorable about the sounds.
Character 6/10: 
The characters were alright. I liked Hayasaka and Miyuki the most. Kaguya was alright, but I'm not crazy about her. The two most annoying characters I really didn't like were Chika and Ishigami, I hate the both of them. As someone said... I think they were mostly just slapped in the show for stale and unfunny gags and jokes. I'd personally watch Hayasaka bathe than to watch Chika being ditzy, loud and annoying. Ishigami was just an annoying emo fuck who I could really give a shit less about. The narrator was funny, although I felt like he wasn't needed but comedy I guess.
Enjoyment 6/10: 
There were some moments I did enjoy the show but because of the formulaic episodes it gets boring quickly.
Overall 6/10:
I know it sounded like I was shitting on this anime hard, but believe me when I say I did enjoy it at times. Other times I felt like the show was wasted in potential with zero character development, and the show just running on dumb comedy and unfunny jokes and gags that are so predictable to redeem itself. This is just a generic rom-com dude. I seriously don't get the hype about it. Rom-coms always make the characters confess their love in the end of its second season. Why can't you do something different for once and maybe surprise your viewers by doing something unpredictable and unlike any other by maybe... OH, I DUNNO- MAKING YOUR CHARACTERS CONFESS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEASON BUT WORK A GOOD REALATIONSHIP BUILDUP BEFORE YOU DO. Animes like this are the exact reason I don't just buy manga. Because then when there is zero character development, predictable shit, and like every other anime out there that has done the SAAAAAME THING, I FELT LIKE NOT ONLY DID I WASTE MY MONEY, BUT THOSE MINUTES OR HOURS OF MY LIFE I WILL NEVER GET BACK. Lol, I'm sorry for the rant. Hopefully someone can relate.  Anyways if you like a good comedy with zero character developments and unfunny humor, go for it. Be warned though, you might get disappointed just like I did.",6
"
                I've enjoyed the show very much and I'm rating mostly from enjoyment. It's perfect to watch without much thought (although I had some 300iq moments, since I'm a nonsocial gamer) and purely enjoy the visuals and interactions between characters. Simply a well executed comedy with romance elements (if you're looking for deep relationship between the characters, that's not it).
The setting is very common, plot is pretty nonexistant thanks to the episodical nature. It didn't really matter to me because it isn't the reason I watch a comedy romance for. I don't have any complaints to the pacing, which is often problematic to me. 
I really
                  enjoyed the animation (Chika's dance <3), simple but very clean character designs. Overall quality is better than I thought is needed. The scenes are pretty simple but there were quite a few good looking moments with nice special effects.
Nice opening and ending, good background music and sound effects. Nothing very memorable.
The characters are very stereotypical and simple, but all I were looking for were funny and interesting interactions between them. I've gotten a lot of that! Relations between them don't really change, there's not much development, but they're just wonderful in their seemingly complicated symplicity.
If I were watching this anime in one go I'd probably get bored thanks to the repetitive nature but I didn't so it was really enjoyable and funny (the humour is very straight, but even though I don't laugh very often it cracked me quite a few times).",8
"
                This show is FUN. 
I was surprised by how straight out of the gate it was with the presentation. The narration, internal dialog and overall scenes were very deliberate. I thought that the nuance was going to be shortlived after a few episodes, but I was never once disappointed and was very excited to move to the next season. Each realistic panics, threats to their pride, perceived crises as well as intellectual reasoning are analyzed (with exaggeration and comedic phrasing) is handled excellently. It's what we really go through, just with a lot of focus on just how silly some of it really seems to
                  be.
Broken down into 3 mini-scenes per episode, it keeps things on their feet while giving a bit of a respite from either scene to scene or even episode to episode, depending on the where the plot is. All classes of insiders, outsiders, popular, self-defined popular, preps, jocks and anything else inbetween are there and with relative importance from how they fit into a high school hierarchy.They're all relevant to some point! 
This is well done and worth a watch. Quite possibly the easiest binge what start to a show that I've seen to date.",10
"
                One of the BEST anime I have ever watched! Most romance anime I watched is about a love triangle. However, the anime Love is war really blew me away! I have never imagined a war to be like this! This is so creative and amazing! I could not stop watching it! very interesting plot! 
The character designs are so beautiful and cute! Voiceovers are super cute too! Really love the theme song! Love is war, love is war! 
I really really enjoyed this! I really really recommend everyone to watch it! 
I love it so so much! This is life!",10

                  would lose.

"
                Before I start, please note some of the following points may contain slight spoilers – unintentional ones, hence the use of the word ""may.""
Story – Doesn't have much of a story, mostly episodic. However, it does follow a time flow. And the main focus of the story is about two tsundere being unable to confess their love. The adaptation from the Manga to Anime was amazingly well done. The episodes were really well written, well made storyboard. I absolutely loved the work the studio did with Kaguya-sama and hope that other studios will learn from this 😆 : 10/10
.
Characters – Characters were really well developed.
                  Especially Kaguya in the last few episodes. It just shows how much Kaguya has suffered and how she now has friends to support her. And as for Shirogane, this truly shows how much he cares about Kaguya and would throw away his pride to make Kaguya happy, despite not being able to do so to confess. Chika being a chaos factor really adds to the show. Chika just went from low ranking to high ranking from Manga to Anime thanks to how well they portrayed Chika and how much it really showed her character. 😆 : 10/10
.
Art Style – Absolutely astonishing. The artstyle is clean and beautiful. I absolutely love how the character designs turned out, staying true to the original source. Absolutely beautiful background works too! : 10/10
.
Animation – Again, absolutely astonishing. On the first episode, the animation for transitioning from Shirogane to Kaguya saying ""Okawaii Koto"" was so well done that it completely hooked me in even if I was a Manga reader and know what happens, etc. The animation is super fluid. The opening transitions too were absolutely fluid. The studio has done an absolutely amazing job! : 10/10
.
Music – The OP-ED are absolutely amazing and catchy, and don't get me started with Chika dance! The OSTs were all really well composed! Absolute masterpieces!
.
Overall Score : 10/10
Should you watch this? (Summary of review) – ABSOLUTELY! The show really helped me laugh, relax after a hard day and just made me enjoy my free time. The comedy is absolutely amazing, the animation is fluid, etc. Enjoyment level 100!",10
"
                8,5/10
This is how a romcom anime should be, It's simply a fun anime to watch, the way they wanted the other person to confess their love is so hilarious, I loved the side characters too (Chika is soo damn cute, and I could relate with Ishigami a lot). It's not an anime that focused on character developments so it's more focused toward their everyday's love conflict. The animation is so well done it helped a lot making the comedy funnier. The music is also great sometimes it's a little bit overdramatic but thats what makes it even funnier. I also loved both the OP and
                  ED songs.
If you're looking for a romcom anime then you won't be disappointed with this one. But just remember the manga is still ongoing so don't expect the ending to be conclusive. I really hope it would get a 2nd season.",8
"
                Funny, witty, clever, beautiful, meaningful, original - I will not be shy on praises about the title that kept me laughing from the very first minutes up until the very end of the season. I do not know how to advertise comedy rather than saying that it is so so funny. The show itself is a collection of vignettes, called “matches”, where Kagya or President attempt to make the other one to confess. The way they are trying to do this, the methods they use, supporting third person narration, other character involvement, art direction - everything about love matches is awesome. It may be ludicrous
                  at times but never dull or stupid. Speaking of art direction, Kaguya-sama: Love is War is the rarest case where picture sometimes jokes by itself, no text needed. Highest production quality extends to the drawing in general, visual beauty of the show can be seen by mere glance at Kaguya’s eyes. What is more important, though, is that art is diverse, shifting constantly between various styles (due to parody needs) but realizing each imitation impeccably. 
Characters based on quite common tropes but writing around them is brilliant. Blend of Lelouch/Kira like arrogance and cute shyness in protagonists is hilarious and, at the same time, extremely smooth and plausible. Both Fujiwara and Ishigami seem like bland stereotypes at first but the way they are blended into main flow is smart and funny. But what surprised me most of all in Love is War is how acute physiological exposition is. I mean, it is an upfront comedy but portrayal of Kaguya and President’s feelings and thoughts is far more believable and relatable than in many purely dramatic competitors, even acclaimed ones. I guess it is a side effect of the fact that Love is War is a romance in a core. Romance is, by the way, quite prominent with actual progression and attention. So the series is not an endless charade of meaningful jokes but a focused story with a clear artistic intent. But funnily enough, I’d rather see the romance gone. It is just everything about comedy is so good that romance counterpart simply looks quite ordinary.
Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen is third anime ever that made me laugh. Third anime ever that could compete with western sitcoms. Is there more shows like this one?
8/10",8
"
                Pat on the back.
Truly a wonderful anime. I was expecting more of a one-sided tsundere situation but was pleasantly surprised. The concept is great, and I really enjoyed all of the events that happened in every episode.
The art, voice actors and sound effects were average. Nothing that stands out but not bad either.
The characters though, you never know what'll happen next when they're interacting. It's a well-made romance/comedy anime. I love how both Kaguya and Shirogane are both tsundere in a sense. They've done something quite different and they've done it well.
Very enjoyable, I would recommend to someone looking for a unique romance anime to
                  watch to relax and get a good laugh out of.",8
"
                This anime was way too hyped up in my opinion.
I am fully aware that theres other seasons of love is war, but the first season was truly just bull. it has a slow burn, but I wouldn't even call it that, because nothing happens. the plot can sometimes be hard to follow and the whole thing is just weird.
I absolutely regret watching, especially because now I know I'll have to watch season 2 after a rather bad season one. 
The characters were fine, not the best, but they weren't the concern. 
I also have no complains about the art really.
The story was weird, and kinda
                  dumb. I would call it mutual pining but they both are aware of feelings it's obvious.
I will say i enjoyed the thrill I guess, I just wish something would've happened.",4
"
                I don't know where to start.....
First off, I started watching anime only like 2 years or so ago. Check my list in that time I have watched many types of anime. Some anime I used to like a lot during my starting days but, i don't like them at all now.
This anime, it's story is nothing much you can pretty much get the story from the description available here. Basically what happens is 2 people fall hard for each other but, their ego stops them from confessing what they think is they will make the other person confess first. As the narrator puts it ""The
                  one to confess first losses.""
What we get after that is a hilarious comical situation where both of them use any and all means available to them to get a confession out of the other. Often their overthinking of the situation is hilarious to watch.
Both of them study in a F*king high class school - Shuchiin Academy.
This show only has like 4 characters you need to know:
Miyuki - Male protagonist. Belongs to a poor family. He is the student council president only because of his exceptional conduct and grades. 
Kaguya - Female (Titular) Protagnist. belongs to damn rich family. She is a genius in almost everything except IT. Student Council wise president.
Chika - Kaguya's best (maybe only) friend. She plays the wild card between Miyuki and Kaguya. Whenever things start to get good or sometimes bad (well mostly VERY funny) she stops them. She calls herself Love Detective(Rove Taantei). Secretary, student council.
Yuu - My favorite among the 4 student council members. A hikkikomori and he is scared of Kaguya that she will kill him or Chika someday.... Due to hikkikomori personality, he often gets into awkward (again, mostly funny) moments with other council members. Shown to be rather observant and skilled in computers. He is the treasury man of the student council.
All in all, one of the best animes to come out this year. This is something you can enjoy with your family (Given they have no problem watching anime) and enjoy a LOT. This is easily one of the best love-come animes i have seen.
I guarantee you're gonna love this and yes, CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 2!!!",9
"
                I didn't enjoy Kaguya Sama as much as everyone said that I would. I didn't really feel the Love or War in this season. I went into this show with high hopes, but for me it was overhyped and it let me down. Just a little. The premise of this show made it sound fun, but it was lacking the wackyness that it promised. We follow Shinomiya Kaguya and Miyuki Shirogane as they each try to get the other to confess their love for the opposite person. But instead we get a lot of inner monologues between Kaguya and Shirogane but not a lot of
                  actual interesting of fun character interactions between the pair. I did like the opening song and the supporting characters of Fujiwara Chika and Ishigami Yuu
, I thought they were fun and that they brought most of the enjoyment out of the show.  The Noir type art style did fit the story perfectly and the narrations were also fun. I gave Kaguya Sama: Love is a war season 1 a 6/10. there were definitely a lot of things that could've been improved upon.",6
"
                Many people called this show as Death Note of Romance stories. That being said, its nowhere close to those claims as the best part about Death Note was not the overplanning but how it built to climatic moments. This series, on the other hand, is more about bowing down to ego and works hilariously well.
The entire premise is about getting the other person to confess first and I sincerely hope that by the time it ends, they get over it. Shows which don't take its ridiculousness seriously often work well and this is one of them. The show is at its best when the planning
                  is at its highest hype and they fall apart. 
Overall its a good one time watch and a very good parody on cliched romantic tropes. And negative points for not adding Chika's dance into every episode.",8
"
                Romance anime. The genre of romance in anime has been tried and true, and over time has been incorporating serious and realistic elements such as in Tsuki ga Kirei, comedy harem elements like in Nisekoi, or a combination of supernatural and dramatic elements like in Nagi no Asukara. Every now and then a great show stands head and shoulders over others and brings something truly interesting and worth watching to the table. This Winter 2019 season, that show is Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen, a perfect example of a successful romantic comedy. 
Plot: The plot of Kaguya sama is as follows. At a
                  particular prestigious private high school named Shu’chin Academy, two student geniuses who are members of the student council fall in love with each other, but their mutual stubborn sense of pride as geniuses prohibit them from confessing to one another, so they engage in a series of games in order to force the other to confess and by doing so the confessing party will “lose” to the other. Over the course of the school year, no progression has been made in their relationship thus far, so both resort to insane shenanigans to get the other to admit that they’ve fallen for them. 
Characters: The two geniuses are Miyuki Shirogane, the intelligent and hardworking student council president who lives in poverty, and Kaguya Shinomiya, an extremely capable girl who is heir of the wealthy and influential Shinomiya family. Other characters are introduced as the series continues, such as the ditzy yet somewhat adorable secretary Chika Fujiwara, Kaguya’s best friend, as well as the incredibly efficient but depressing treasurer Yuu Ishigami. 
Art: The art and animation for Kaguya sama is by no means revolutionary, but do well to serve the many moods of the manga, such as when Shirogane has one of his “how cute” Kaguya delusions, or when Chika Fujiwara degenerates her mortal body into an adorable moe blob creature. The animation quality is overall subpar in the broad spectrum of other romantic comedy anime, but it at the very least leagues ahead of the abomination of an adaptation that is the Quintessential Quintuplets, another romantic comedy anime airing this season. 
Comedy:The comedy for Kaguya sama is one of its defining features as a successful anime. Each  episode is a new battle for the characters, from psychological warfare to… well just more psychological warfare to be completely honest. It invests a good deal in repetitive jokes, particularly the “how cute” that Kaguya delivers in Shirogane’s delusions. But rather than become annoying and stale, the phrase is always used in proper comedic timing, which is quite impressive and characteristic of many quality comedy anime. 
Music: The music of this anime is fantastic. The opening song, Love Dramatic by Masayuki Suzuki has an upbeat funky 80`s love song feel that is accompanied with visuals that create the impression that this is a show about spies. The visuals are actually quite reminiscent of the opening of the James Bond movie Skyfall, a likely homage by A-1. It sets the tone perfectly for an anime about love and intellectual games. The ending song, Sentimental by Halca ends off the anime’s episodes well, showing Kaguya in a more vulnerable light, and serves well to display just how important her friends are to her, which is excellent foreshadowing. This theme is more lighthearted and lovelike. The soundtracks that are accompanied with the scenarios presented in the anime are fitting as well, such as the theme that plays every time Kaguya says the magic words in Shirogane’s delusions. One particular mention of the impressive soundtrack is in the final episode, when Kaguya’s sad past is revealed. It makes it very easy to feel for the character, and helps to develop her further as a lovable heroine. 
The theme of“Love is War” , is an extremely fitting one for this show. What sets this show apart is that it uses an initial conflict between two characters that are in love with each other as a central theme. It is different from an anime like Nisekoi, which pits the main characters against each other with no romantic interests at all. On the contrary, Kaguya sama starts off with them deeply in love with each other but unable to take the first step without “losing.” What makes this show absolutely enjoyable and quality is its successful use of its combination of basic romantic comedy tropes as well as the repetitive jokes that are always funny, accompanied with good art and a fantastic soundtrack. Taking all of this into account, I believe that Kaguya-sama deserves a 9/10 for its unique presentation of these traits, and a season 2.",9
"
                This is one of the funniest anime i have watched in some time. Everything about this anime is so good and want to watch more of these characters just act randomly.  I wasn't sure if i was going to watch the anime at all, but im glad i picked it up because it was a lot of fun waiting every week to see what kind of funny stuff will happen with the student council members.
First the story, where do i begin with the story on this show. I think knowing that the main characters are in love with each other is a good concept,
                  but trying to have one of them say they like the other is so funny. While Miyuki Shirogane makes things up on the fly and gets the reaction we want its funny to see the lengths Kaguya Shinomiya goes to to see if Shirogane will confess his love to her. Then bringing in Chika Fujiwara as the comedic relive of the show is even better with everything she does almost makes each of the main characters plan either fail completely or help in some way. Personal the way they take each segment and go over top with trying to get a confession is one of the best story elements i have seen this far. 
Next the art. The art in this show is so beautiful and interesting to watch.  The style goes back and forth between what the characters are doing and feeling and then change the background to also show more emotions with the characters. Plus it has a bit of cell shaded art style which i have always liked either in video games or anime. The art style reminds me of Kill la Kill which i also liked, but with the genre this show goes with it just makes the show that much better.
Next the sound. Every sound that the characters made or the music they used was so good. The intro song had a jazzy sound to it and that makes getting into the main show even better. There are two examples of the sound that makes this show even better. The first is every single sound the Chika Fujiwara makes. When she makes a random noise i cant help but laugh just because thats her character personality and her noises are so good. Another is when someone gets hit or falls and it perfectly makes you laugh from the sound and the characters which is always good while watching an anime. 
Next the characters. I can finally start talking about the characters. This is why i really enjoyed this anime so much. The characters made this show so good and are over the top, but thats why people like these characters just because of there personalities. Miyuki Shirogane tries to be the perfect student to everyone around him, but to the viewers we see how much effort he has put in to be where he is and we understand why he is like he is. Kaguya Shinomiya wants to make everything go her way and always plans ahead to do it. But she isnt perfect and we see that time and time again when facing off with Shirogname or Chika butting in with her funny personality is fun to watch. Chika is just funny in general with her being the air head to the group and the most enjoyable to watch.
Finally the enjoyment. Like i said at the beginning of this, I really enjoyed watching this anime to the very end and waiting every single week for the next episode was worth it. I would love it if they made more episodes of this show because i always want a good laugh from what i watch and this story and the characters are doing it for me 100%. 
Overall this is a really great anime and i hope down in the future we get to see more of Kaguya, Miyuki, Chika and the others do crazy stuff and see if one of them will confess there love in the future.",9

                >>This review does not contain spoilers<<
I´m going to keep it really simple. This show was amazing. The opening is a freaking banger and so is the closing song. But the most impressive thing about it all was the fact that it made me laugh every single episode. I´m not even joking! I have never watched something as hilarious as this. At first, I found the narration a bit annoying but by the second episode you find out, that the narration is what makes this so funny. I can only wholeheartedly recommend anyone to watch this and say that this was a masterpiece. For, me it
                  was an easy 10/10",10

                NO SPOILERS REVIEW
Arguably, one of the most prominent anime among romcom genres, and that is Kaguya-sama. The most noticeable part from this series is the fact that it has a psychological genre. You might find yourself baffled initially, but don't misunderstand it. Why? I'll tell you the reason below.
Story (10/10):
A-1 Pictures did a spectacular job in adapting Kaguya-sama. For your information, its source material (manga) has a perplexing order of manga chapters, for instance, the continuation of chapter 1 might be in the next 2 or 3 chapters, hence making manga readers who are always eagerly waiting for the next chapter to be published, left
                  in confusion. However, A-1 Pictures meticulously crafted the anime so that the story will be more understandable by skipping some chapters which they considered to have a different timeline and put it in the next episode, thus making this anime look immaculate. Now, about the psychological tag, what does it mean? Does this anime have some kind of somber moments inside? Huge no. I personally and honestly incline that the moments where MC and Kaguya attempt to make the other party fall in love is the psychological part, because later, their plans ultimately will be revealed by the narrator and explains the reason psychologically. At the end of the day, it's just a romcom that you would expect. The atmosphere this anime generates is just cozy and utterly enjoyable. 
Art (10/10):
A-1 Pictures has proven themselves to be a top-tier studio this last decade, specifically on their animations, and this anime is your concrete evidence. Distinct and colorful background, as well as the appealing characters, everything is designed flawlessly. 
Sound (9/10):
The SFX are well-made and it realistically depicts the situation. The opening song, which is sung by the renowned Masayaki Suzuki, somehow gives nostalgic vibes (cuz he's well-known in the 1900s era after all). The ending song, sadly, doesn't emit a pleasant and warm sound, it's just not my cup of tea. 
Character (10/10):
The characters, both main and side characters, are indubitably charming appearance-wise (Kei Shirogane) and have loveable traits (especially Kaguya and Ishigami). What makes this show cut above the rest is the indisputable fact that every single character is hilarious and kind of innocent, as well as oblivious, however not to the point where it irritated me, instead I genuinely enjoyed their innocence. Furthermore, As the story progresses, you will witness outstanding character development as well. The student council members each have their respective grim past, which eventually bring them together later on and encourage each other to move on from their past. Not only that, but also romance development has a steady pace, from detesting each other to.... (not going to spoil you). Moreover, the student council members aka the main characters have equitable on-screen time, except for side characters of course, which is very unfortunate (I am craving for more Kei!). Apart from that, everything is just impeccable. 
Enjoyment (10/10):
I barely remember a time where I felt cringe or found the show distasteful. From the bottom of my heart, I truly adore this anime. 
Overall (10/10):
From the get-go, I knew this anime has enormous potential to be the best romance ever. All in all, everything exceeded my expectation, and I sincerely wish Kaguya-sama could get a complete adaptation, which is a reasonable hope, considering that the source material of this anime (manga) is very renowned in Japan. Romance anime with fluffy atmosphere, likable characters, exquisite animation, impressive voice acting, how could you loathe this anime? 
Side note: Don't be deluded by the psychological tag.",10

                Review of Toradora 2 Electric Copypaste.
Story: Nothing innovative here. Highschool, clubs, bullying, ""romance"", yare yare.
Art: Cool i guess.
Character: Taiga has grown up a little bit and her eyes are red (probably of how much she has been crying about living in luxury her whole life or some bs like that). She is still an obnoxiously annoying character but at least she only verbally mistreats the people around her unlike the first season. But every ounce of toxic waste that she saves is poured on Ishigami because she doesnt like him even if she says otherwise.
The self insert dude is still poor and relatable and he
                  still has a ""mean"" face.
He is also called Shiromine or Shirogane or something like that for some reason. We get a new look at his toughts which opens a massive development to his character (yes, now we can properly say he is a character and not a bunch of cliches and tropes sticked together).
Minori is no longer an inmate in a mental institution and we can see the massive progress that the doctors achieved trough her many years confined in there.
Her hair is now pink and everyone must call her Chika because thats how the doctor that gave her breast implants called her or some shit i dont know.
On this serie the animators tried to make her more cute and less mental but they went too far and now she feels like an artificial construct. You could replace her with a robot and nothing would change.
Ishigami Yuu is a new addition to the show. It seems that the creators realized that they were repeating absolutely everything they did last time so they slapped a new well tought realistic character in this whole operation.
Sadly reason and realism is wrong and since Minorin and Taiga werent bullyng people around the show was in danger of feeling ""too different"".
So Ishigami went from being a nice well tought addition to the show to being the punching bag of the rest of the character.
He is there to act like a normal highschool boy and be bullied for it because being a normal person in an anime is wrong.
He also is with the rest of the main characters but he only appears at the half of the anime for some reason (guess he was hiding under the desk the past 5 episodes because of the intense physical and emotional beating that Kagu- i mean Taiga gave him).
Now Taiga has a maid and she is put there to represent the people that disliked Toradora on the first season (ergo people with taste or a minimal ammount of common sense). Her role is to take care of Taiga on this new season and she is honestly really relatable to people like me because she has to resist all the bs that happens from having Taiga around you.
She is also blonde and seems to have a life outside Taiga so yeah she is a character whose existence doesnt entirely revolves around another character... thats cool. 
Cant remember her name tough. My bad.
Taiga's dad: He is now some shinobi kendo yakuza boss for some reason. He is still an asshole so not much to say about him.
Enjoyment: For my surprise this season of Toradora was fine. I was expecting for Minorin to slam her best friend against the wall again, you know for old times sake. Maybe on the next season tough.
Sadly the show relies too much on puking this half assed cliched amalgam of tropes ""characters"". Imagine if each character was as decently written as Ishigami!
But who cares about good character writing?!? We have to make the rich spoiled short flat tsundere whose life is better than 90% of the viewers go trough some emotional bs again because her father is not present because somehow the fact that your father is distant will leave some kind of crippling emotional scar on your life-
We must have a cheerful ex mental patient with a huge rack dancing around, being the third wheel and stopping the progress of the plot because she has huge boobs so sheeps wont care about her problems! Because cheerful girls with big boobs are perfect and we must slap them on every school anime.
We HAVE to have some self insert poor tall dude with a ""mean"" face whose dick is wanted by every girl in the school. 
I dunno maybe its too much to ask for the anime to not treat me like a... ""slow"" person.
Because having a narrator describing everything that has been said and done for 2 hours each episode must be crucial. Because how else we could realize what its happening? 
The daily life of 3 highschool students its too complex for us to understand.
Kaguya saying that she might go out with a boy out loud in front of her crush? Omg what is happening i cant possibly deduce in any way that she might be trying to get her crush jealous and get a reaction out of him. I mean i feel silly from even mentioning such a bold theory!
Why im so dumb? 
Final score: Im too tired to care or properly explain the other categories.
The show is fine and if you havent watched a single anime in your entire life you might enjoy it more. 
Chika is so artificial and fake that her only goal seems to be waifu bait or some stupid shit like that. Also Kaguya and Shirogane like each other because the writter said so ¡Just like Toradora or Kimi no Na Wa! Im really getting sick of people saying ""these 2 characters like each other"" and people screaming ""This is the best romance ever written!"" while they mention how much they cried with this shitty excuse of a romance.
I liked the anime. If the narrator wasnt so annoying or the characters were more... like characters i would have enjoyed it more.",7
"
                I'm not a fan of long reviews so I'm going to keep this short and to the point.
Wait, did A-1 make a good manga adaptation? 
The story was well done, and kept me entertained in every episode, although a few felt a little boring and dragged, it was mostly fun to watch. 
The art was pretty well done, and the animation was actually good. There weren't any issues with it, and it felt natural throughout. 
The characters in the show were great. Although there could have been more engagement from the more side characters, they were still pretty well written and all had good designs.
                  Their personalities were great and went perfectly with the story, making it much more entertaining to watch. 
Overall, it was a fun show, but it could have been better. It's worth watching if you want a bit of fun. (season 2 was better)",8
"
                This series has beautiful pacing, funny moments, and emotional pulls that keep you interested all the way until the final episode (of the season that is). If you are a fan of romantic comedies, or are interested in getting into them, I would highly reccomend this series: the quality is high enough for a new romantic comedy watcher to be interested, while the story is unique enough for more experienced individuals to enjoy it. 
Pros:
The art style is amazing, and the way certain scenes are designed makes every intended emotion hit harder, whether it be comedy, sadness, love, or even comedy (it's mostly comedy mixed
                  in there). 
The characters are interesting, and while the series walks the line of being repetitive, the way the characters interact is unique to this series (ishigami is a major highlight to show what I mean), and their development feels natural and not forced (the backstories are great). 
One last pro would be the pacing: the show never gets dull, and it's constantly throwing new scenarios at you, but without being overbearing (as in, way too fast). 
Cons:
If you don't like romantic comedies, this might not be something you'd enjoy. And while I would actually recommend this to new viewers (as mentioned previously) it's still a series that continues on the same war trope between the two main characters. If a series that relies one main pretext that doesn't get resolved for the sake of the story, then you won't like this. The character development is great, and the characters themselves are great, but the story involves a war between the two main characters, so the progress in their relationship is very small.
A potential con could be the investment not paying off, but that's normal for most romantic animes and mangas I'd argue. If you find yourself invested in this show, but the ending doesn't come out the right way, it'll be devastating.",9

                Kaguya-sama: Love is War
This series has been on my waiting list for a long time, and now I finally got to enjoy a very balanced comedy that was pleasing to my palate. 
Love is War is a romantic comedy that intentionally mocks the familiar school romance concept and tries to create as many absurdly bizarre situations as possible. It does this brilliantly well, especially thanks to the characters and how the jokes are tied among them. 
In the main role are the 2 protagonists, who are practically indomitable geniuses in their own respective domains. However, as soon as it comes to love, their IQ collapses
                  and they behave like little children hearing about love for the first time.  
The premise of this series is that the 2 protagonists push each other to have the other confess love to them. With this idiotic attitude, they keep running into the wall, just to avoid making the first embarrassing move. Even though this joke becomes relatively monotonous in the long run, the author has done his best to make the scenarios as individual as possible. 
The humor of the show makes use of exaggeration and parody of many well-known RomCom events and problems from everyday life. Although the concept is simple and the templates are already there. Nevertheless, in the area of humor, almost the best possible was taken out of the various scenes. 
Unfortunately, most of the jokes in the series are much more amusing than the actual running gag of the show. 
[Story 1]
There is none, of course. Their everyday life consists only of trapping each other and throwing romantic glances at each other now and then. And, of course, taking over their duties in the student council and escaping Chika's madness.
[Characters 4]
We have the self-sacrificing heroic role model protagonist Shirogane, who does everything to help others and breaks his own limit to keep up with the smartest geniuses in society. 
Kaguya is your typical cliché Tsundere (yes, she has the Japanese voice actor of Paimon from Genshin).
Ishigami is the typical outsider who doesn't fit into society. 
And Chika, the hyperactive stupid, and naive nut.
The typical RomCom team that everyone wants! - Of course not.
But the author has given all of them several characteristics and combined them perfectly with the humorous basics of this show. If it weren't for the characters, the jokes would be much less effective. Through their exaggerated traits, they have become very high-quality humorous characters. 
Unexpectedly, Ishigami and Chika became my favorites, although I would have definitely bet on the other 2. 
[Animation 8 / Sound 9 ]
The pacing is fast and the scene changes are very professionally done. The animations vary greatly between immensely high quality and above average depending on the situation. The background details are also variable. The scene changes and the different perspectives left a particularly positive impression. 
The outro takes some time to get used to and isn't particularly impressive, but it's still enough. 
The intro, on the other hand, is one of the musically best intros I've ever heard and an absolute earworm.
The Osts make the whole thing even a cream crown. Not only their perfect placement of comedy timing but also the refreshing variety. 
[Conclusion 7]
Love is War is a very remarkable comedy and convinced us a lot with the first season. While there was a lack of individuality in this one, the show feels slightly limited, as you know what events it's already going to come down to. However, it doesn't mean you're immune to the brain-burningly amusing humor of this Anime. 
Definitely recommended for any comedy fan, even if the hype had clearly promised too much.

"
                DAM GOOD BOY. Love the love hate thingy dat goes on but like, the only reason i have 8 for sound is because of that annoying meme of the outro where she keeps dancing. ENJOYED THE ANIME VERY VERY MUCH and if ur reading this review that is probably in the depth of the ocean due to everyone reviewing, I will like to give my opinion that SICK KAGUYA IS CUTE. THE ANIME IS JUST SO PURE AND EVEYONE IS SO GOOD. (not being creepy or anything) and I really think a season 2 3 4 5 6 is needed (if they can make more
                  content that is) since i don't want any random fillers like *Kaguya lost her mitten* or some sht like that. (You'll get the reference if u had a childhood with Diary of a Wimpy Kid). Overall its a 10 out of 10 for me and I know that comedic romance anime are not for everyone (ahem* Gundam watchers) but I would HIGHLY suggest that you watch this anime as it'll just fill that large whole in your heart with wholesome high school moments. PRESS THAT THINGY ON THE BOTTEM AND DONT FORGET TO ADD THIS TO YOUR ANIME LIST :)",10
"
                You know those romcom series that have you watch the entire series just to blue ball you at the end with nary ANY progression in the ""will they/won't they"" scenario?  How about we do that, but parody the living crap out of it and make it even more roundabout while we're at it?
Story:
In the prestigious Shuchiin Academy student council sits two of the students top students: the brilliant Miyuki Shirogane who managed to get into this academy filled with students of high status and influence, and Kaguya Shinomiya, daughter to the massive Shinomiya conglomerate.  Though seemingly perfect for each other, the two because of prideful
                  (and stupidly hilarious) reasons have not confessed to each other out not wanting to show weakness to the other.  After all, love is war, and the first to crumble under the psychological warfare is the loser.
Taking a small slice of the original manga (because believe me, this goes on for a while), Kaguya-sama is ultimately a romcom series that has the audience sit in waiting watching the show's main couple attempt to socialize/get closer with each other with varying degrees of success each time.  Each episode consists of three or so chapters of the manga with the 'result' of each battle being shown right before the commercial break so stat trackers have an easy way to tally up the number of victories, losses, and stalemates on each side.  What happens in these chapters however can vary from a wide array of different romance, school, and slice of life tropes all given the 'Akasaka' spin that makes the show so memorable and worth watching in the first place.
The 'Akasaka' spin is Akasaka-sensei's way of exaggerating and turning literally every possible scene and action conceivable into a mindgame where the protagonists consistently fight with each other in psychological warfare trying to predict and counter each other's next move, focusing almost exclusively on internal monologue and usage of a third party narrator in order to relay information to the audience given the hilarious complexity of trying to achieve something as simple as trying to offer him a ride home in the rain.  This makes up the lion's share of the series, being one of the show's major sources of comedic fuel and one of the primary reasons why the show is ultimately so entertaining to begin with because everything is taken so hilariously seriously.
While the show only makes incremental amounts of progress due to the series ultimately still being a romcom that has no way to go anywhere fast with only twelve episodes, the show more than makes up for the lack of speed by making the ride there as ludicrous and needlessly roundabout as possible.  It's not a show where you (mostly) watch the characters try and get together, but rather one where the ride is more important because the presentation and portrayal of typical anime scenes make it so.  Because believe me, it's funnier having them spend time lamenting over their own stupidity rather than having the stupid happen without any acknowledgment.
Characters:
For a pair of supposed geniuses, these two are a pair of lovable dunderheads.  Kaguya and Miyuki act as the series's centerpiece and the primary reason why the show is so much fun to watch to begin with.  Though on the outside they seem like the refined rich lady and the accomplished brainiac, other factors that come into play like sheltered knowledge and social ineptitude come up quite often in their quests to try and 'conquer' the other.  More often than not the traits of themselves they try to hide from the public eye come out in the limelight, resulting in many, many moments of Kaguya's softer side, a lot of moments with Miyuki mentally shutting down from trying to think things through, and a near excessive amount of overthinking where they each think they fucked up when trying to romance the other despite more often than not, the opposite effect is taking place.
Because there aren't enough wrenches thrown into the mix due to the protagonists' ineptitude, the show also spotlights the two other members of the student council: the spunky living meme Chika Fujiwara, and Ishigami Yuu halfway through the series.  Explaining these two can be easily described as: the spunky, airheaded secretary that unknowingly manipulates everyone around her for personal gain, and the depressed otaku gamer that just wants to be left alone with his life intact.  For the most part, these two act as stopgates (mostly Chika) or 'hinderances' (again, mostly Chika) to the goals of our main couple.  The show primarily uses these two during times when the show tries to take a break from its romance aspect and instead puts the 'Akasaka' spin on really whatever it fucking wants.  Ishigami doesn't really get much of this since he's barely here for even half the show, but Chika certainly takes up a large portion of the show with her antics to break up the usual action.
The majority of the side cast usually doesn't take up really take up enough time to matter most of the time, which is a shame given the consistency of their appearances.  At most we see Kaguya's personal maid Hayasaka show up in the latter half, as well as the couple of Kashiwagi and her boyfriend for some much needed 'normies go explode' moments.  Personally I'm disappointed at how criminally underused Miyuki's family is, as Kei is by far my favorite character in this series, and their dad hardly shows up enough to matter which, if you got Dio to voice the man, you should use him just a little more.  (Also cause the man's hilarious too.)
Aesthetics:
I'm not really sure how A-1 had any budget leftover to do both this and SAO concurrently, but hey, I'm not complaining.  However because of that arrangement, the art for Kaguya-sama somehow feels a bit lacking.  At points the show looks a lot rougher than it probably should have, which is made more apparent given the sheer amount of dynamic animation the show employs in order to bring out the inner psyche of these idiots.  The color scheme this time is also pretty dull and not much pops out unless the show for some reason decides it's time to make Chika the star for a brief moment and brighten up the background.
However art isn't really where the show shines, but in the animation.  Because of the nature of this show, A-1 employs an absurd amount of speed lines, metaphoric cutaways, and complete contrast to the show's typical artstyle in order to make the show visually interesting.  Because of this, a lot of the time the show doesn't even have the background JUST be the student council room or any other typical setpiece, once again furthering the show from your typical romcom while making it stylistically different and interesting.
Personally I'm not really a fan of the tracks in the show.  Masayuki Suzuki's ""Love Dramatic"" is certainly a unique song, being a lot more jazzy than I expected with the chorus of 'Love is War' being accompanied by visuals reflective of the show's psychological nature.  It's just however something I'm not a fan of, but I definitely do recommend it as a listen.  To contrast, halca's ""Sentimental Crisis"" is a more instrumental and somber piece that's reflective of Kaguya's sentimental crisis as it speaks of the backstory of her prior to being the school's VP (that we don't get to see in this cour).
Then there's the bloody ""Chika Dance"" song that...I guess it's alright.  I admit it's quirky and it pretty much encapsulates her personality in a minute and thirty second bite with a good section of the audience having to google what 'rotoscoping' is due to confusion as to how they managed the almost uncanny visuals of her movement.  However because I'm not really a big fan of Chika, it's not really something I care to ogle over, though I respect the one guy that decided that spending five months of his life to do this was worth it.
Final Thoughts:
I always found Kaguya-sama to be an amusing read because it takes everything that exists in a typical romcom and smashes its face into the pavement in order to assert dominance by practically making fun of the genre whilst throwing its own story of two characters trying to confess to each other into the mix, so it's no surprise the series took off as well as it did.
Though it looks a little lower budget than I expected given its popularity, the adaptation didn't disappoint and I'm glad that at least one of my favorite series this season got the attention and care that it deserves.  My only lament beyond the side cast not shining as much as I wanted them to is that the fact that they didn't have Jouji Nakata do the voice of the narrator, because they had him do something like that for Noucome way back when, and that was fucking hilarious cause the dude couldn't hold it together when doing some of the lines.  Yutaka Aoyama still does a good job and I'm more than happy that they actually did the narrator because the show literally wouldn't be the same without one constantly reiterating stuff in the background.
If you're a romcom fan and want something out of the ordinary to add to your ever growing collection of that genre, Kaguya-sama is definitely one to have.  The presentation more than makes up for the fact that the show barely makes any progress towards the finish line, and all of the ways the characters try to manipulate each other despite ultimately failing at whatever their plan was is hilarious and never fails to deliver a good punchline in the end.  Highly recommend this series, but not THAT much cause Kei got maybe two appearances total, and that to me is a crime of the highest order.",8

"
                Where am I to begin with this anime? It would seem that Kaguya-sama has taken the anime world by storm lately, although I have been somewhat late to the party considering. I was pleasantly surprised at the watchability of this past season's ""it"" show, and before I knew it I had watched the whole thing, for better or for worse. There were times of great enjoyment and times of great recoil. I suppose I'll give a rundown of the specific subscores I've given this anime and conclude with something resembling a meaningful analysis.
First and foremost is the story, which I would give a 6/10, with
                  the MAL description of ""fair"" failing to describe my complex relationship (punning!) with the storyline of Kaguya-sama Love is War. Pick your favorite trope; they're all here! The show centers around an upstanding and noble academy, with the cast fitting the order to a T: exorbitantly wealthy and/or well connected students vs. the minority of hard-working, intelligent, and charismatic ""lower folk"". And of course we, the viewer, shadow a student council. I'll expound on the rant in the ""Character"" section. Basically, you have the codified version of what American parents imagine ""that Chinese animation"" to be: ditsy high school romance and fanservice. Except the core idea of the series is brilliant: two geniuses, akin to Light and L themselves, battling it out in a war...of love? I realize I'm overselling the synopsis, but that's it: an ""honest"" description is an upsell. In reality, there are enough gems embedded in Kaguya-sama to keep that epic image alive, which I suppose is worth commendation. But the characters are by no means comparable to Light or L or anyone from Death Note, the hijinks of the plotline are largely just adequate, and the story is almost always tragically underexplored. The ending...I was hoping not to have to mention the ending, but it comes so hard out of left field that I was grimacing with embarrassment during the middle of the final episode -- which concluded with things somehow returning to how they were at the beginning of the show? The narrator lampshades this, but c'mon. Talk about setting up for a sequel. Where is the class?! This could've been a 10/10!
The art style, in a break from that more maddened strip of review, is just ""good"", plain and simple. It's about what one might expect from a studio like A-1 Pictures, and does a good enough job of distinguishing settings, backgrounds, and so forth. I'm tempted to give this an 8/10 for the fun moments like the spiel about Freudian Psychology, or the wonderful rain shots. By and large, though things are just good -- that is an achievement, mind you. I suppose I would award a 7.5/10 were that an option.
Sound!! This is the elegance of the story actually writ. Though sparse, the sound effects are timely, inspire the right thoughts and feelings, and are generally a wonderful listen. And let me just say that I've listened to the OP on a loop for about an hour, and this was just because I had only then found the time. My only quibble I'd find worth voicing is that they didn't go further! GIVE ME MORE SOUND! Regardless, I'm not just extremely satisfied with the sound, but am quite possibly ready to get engaged with the summative audio design of Kaguya-sama. 9.5/10.
Here is the thick of it. CHARACTER. An ""ice princess"" by her own admission (well, sort of...it was a flashback), who has been softened up by friendship and time away from her stifling home environment. A prodigy raised removed from the pleasures of ""normal life"" and ignored by her parents, left to form attachment to her maid. The trope is expounded as much as one might expect. The depth of Kaguya's backstory is, basically, whatever will sell the next plot motivator. And Shirogane's backstory, which is even more underdeveloped, basically runs the ""academic ace who works his head off to make up for his poor heritage"" thing straight. Ishigami is the resident gamer/otaku and Chika is the resident Best Girl(TM), but every character is at least tolerable on their own, and can genuinely shine (sometimes) when together. It's just...the characters only seem to have their own histories, and their own awareness colored by those histories, when the plot demands it. Up until the final two episodes, Kaguya has been given free reign of what seems to be her entire routine, Shirogane has been becoming gradually more confident and hopeful that Kaguya likes him, and the supporting cast have been fleshed out a bit. And then things take a sudden nosedive, the show desperately tries to squeeze feeling out of Kaguya, Shirogane reverts to a bumbling fool o' love, and the big clincher is when they ""take the other characters along for the ride"" -- literally. In a taxi. The bit with the ramen, and then the taxi driver recognizing Chika for the connoisseur she is, is the saving grace of the final arc. Legends cried. The tug-of-war between the two giants is fun and immersive, but it's never there enough. It falls flat. 5/10: o kawaii koto.
All the previous sections notwithstanding, I still enjoyed Kaguya-sama. Enough to give it an 8/10 in the ""Enjoyment"" index! When the show was funny, I roared with laughter. When the show was clever, I was intrigued, and then awed (Chika's card tricks, anyone?). Some of the jokes were rather on the nose, whatever critique one could extricate from the show was sometimes rather pointed, and overall, I had a good time. Even after a poor showing by the last two episodes, culminating in a supremely disappointing forced reset of the setting (""and thus a new season begins""?...you really hit it on the head, narrator), I was able to have fun with the show. It started somewhat cringeworthy, grew into its own, and then fell flat. I just would hope that the next season is able to better capture what made maybe the fourth to tenth episodes great -- and I've heard the manga improves from here on out, so I'm looking forward to seeing for myself!
Kaguya-sama Love is War just proves my theory that a person can run in circles analyzing their affection for something (a person OR an anime, which is fitting) and still get nowhere. It's best to let things flow and analyze only as you're inclined, lest the value of art as art itself be lost. I'm unaware if there's some greater meaning to the series. I suppose it could be summarized as meaning ""you worry too much""; perhaps, the commentary is simply that, fundamentally, humans are too self-conscious to realize they all just long for one another: we fail so greatly as to make love into war, to make opposites one. But this is no Evangelion. How much meaning could A-1 Pictures have summoned up for Kaguya-sama? Regardless, for a seasonal show, and one which I was able to enjoy, I think Kaguya-sama Love is War is pretty good. It deserves a solid 7.5/10, and has earned my recommendation, if you're in the market for some good laughs.",7

                ENG:
Death Note of love, that would be the word that would perfectly sum up Kaguya-sama.
It is the first romance anime I see and I really liked its ""Eccentric"" style, two protagonists that their synchronization is so high that only they two understand the reason for each attitude that the other takes, a secretary who does not notice the shooting that is happening in front of you and an emo treasurer who only appears to leave the report and flees from fear of Kaguya, a narrator who tells the story as if it were Galvão Bueno (brazillian soccer narrator) narrating a World Cup.
The games are usually
                  very cool and also the dynamics of the characters, especially the Waifu from the anime Chika Fujiwara that makes the anime gear spin.
I just can't like the anime in some moments where the animation drops dramatically and also the narrator despite liking him, some moments he gets to be very nosy. There have moments that are not good it to be talking.
PT-BR :
Death Note do amor, essa seria a palavra que resumiria perfeitamente Kaguya-sama.
É o primeiro anime de romance que vejo e gostei bastante do seu estilo ""Excêntrico"", dois protagonistas que a sincronização deles é tão alta que só eles entendem o motivo de cada atitude que o outro toma, uma secretária que não percebe o tiroteio que está acontecendo na sua frente e um tesoureiro emo que só aparece para deixar o relatório e foge de medo da Kaguya , um narrador que narra a história como se fosse o Galvão Bueno em época de Copa do Mundo. (Obs: para não Brasileiros, Galvão Bueno é um narrador de futebol famoso no Brasil, que narra o jogo de uma forma bem empolgada e energética)
Os jogos geralmente são bem legais e também a dinâmica dos personagens, principalmente a Waifu do anime Chika Fujiwara que faz a engrenagem do anime girar.
Só não consigo gostar do anime em alguns momentos onde a animação cai drasticamente e também o narrador apesar de gostar dele, alguns momentos ele chega a ser muito invasivo.",7

                I was being sceptical at first, but after I watched a few episodes, I laughed. The rom-com story is different from any other rom-com I've encountered, this one is really special for me. The comedy was just at the right proportion for every episode, not to mention their facial expression and their silly thoughts on how and why does he/she act like that just got me right on the head. The selection for their opening is also exceptional, almost perfect, since the beat and the lyrics are matched perfectly, and that's one of the reasons why I kept watching this over and over and over
                  again. For newbies out there, this might not be your typical ""rom-com"" anime, but I must say I'm very pleased with everything inside this anime.",10

                ""The best anime of the year""
This comment I have found severally when people talk about Kaguya-sama:Love is war. It is true that it was funny and had me cracking most of the time but was it really all that? I mean there is Go-tobun no hanyome and a lot of other legendary anime's in 2019, was this one really the best?
That is what I shall endeavor to tell you what this show is all about in the fastest time possible, for I really want to watch something else.
Story...
I trust you have read what this is about, so there is no need for me to paraphrase
                  it. It is kind of interesting how the synopsis refers to them as ""geniuses"" yet when you watch the show you get the feeling that  they are one of the most-well not stupid- but common people that ever lived. Their egos - which is not exactly pride- is sometimes funny and sometime downright annoying.
The story does not really progress throughout the anime- so if you are looking for a serious romance then you are in the wrong place. The both know that the other loves them, yet they both won't confess because it is a ""sign of weakness.""  
It is I have said alternating from plain stupid and annoying to funny and amusing. Depends on who is watching it. 
Art.....
I am no big judge of art but for some weird reason, I find the art in this anime quite unique and deserving of the score I give it.
Character....
The characters do not even have much progress- just like the story. They are quite unique in their own way. There really isn't much to say about them but a mediocore will definitely be doing justice to it.
Enjoyment...
Like I said earlier, this anime is not really serious about 'romance' aspect and it is basically a waste of your time if that is your reason for watching this show, you will surely be terribly disappointed.
The comedy aspect however, is on the top. It is so good that you cannot watch a NEW youtube video about ""Funniest anime scenes"" and not find Love is war among them. All the comedy is kinda on Chika's side though..
I enjoyed this very much- like I said it isn't exactly ver romantic but I find it quite funny.
Overall..
It is great- although I still think it is overrated. The part about having little romance development might change in the coming season two... but I highly doubt it. I am more glad however, to thank all those who voted 'helpful' and 'not helpful' for when you are an otaku like me; all feedback is appreciated.",7

                “Love is War” is an odd show to write a review for, much less to call it an outstanding show. Yet, it embodies the spirit of a show that is instantaneously rewatch-able, phenomenal in an unorthodox sense. In my opinion, despite its flaws, “Love is War” is one of the best psychological anime that I’ve tried.
For me, I love the inner workings of the brain. I love seeing the thought process behind actions and adore when shows find light in the stupidity. This show handles that idea in the most nonchalant way possible. While I wouldn’t go as far as to call it the “death
                  note of rom-coms”, as others have, this show feels like chess with konosuba humor.
The premise for the story is fantastic and execution is done well; however, it reminds me of an episode of Phineas and Ferb. Very little feel as if it has changed throughout the show, but the overarching narrative presses on. Simply put, Love is War doesn’t really have too much plot— it doesn’t pretend like it does either. It’s show works off of character dynamics. It’s how the comedy stems off; it’s how the tear jerking moments occur. The four-man team of the Student Council provides a healthy balance and foil for each of the characters, even if it can feel clique at the time.
Speaking of characters, the relationships between all of them are some of the greatest combinations that I’ve enjoyed. Each interaction plays out differently based on opposition, location, and planning. It’s as if to say “Your next line will be” and this seems to be very intentional, judging by how much they use JoJo poses and sound effects. Overall, I love the characters, but they each feel static at certain times. It’s the Megumin complex, if you will. The characters don’t change much because, simply put, the story doesn’t want them to. They aren’t supposed to change much on the surface and, if you’re coming to see only character development that is explicit, this isn’t the show for you, but if you are looking for a lighthearted comedy this is an absolute banger.
Overall, this show captured my heart. It reminds me of the shows that I grew up watching in the mid-2000s and really captures the essence of both mind games, even if they’re predictable, and comedic repetition. It has shifting dynamic that doesn’t really ever change and I love it for that. If you enjoy seeing what goes on inside a person’s head, this is the show for you!",10
"
                I'll come in upfront with my bias: I'm rating this more as an adaption than a standalone, since I have been keeping up with the manga for more than half a year now.
Thus, I'm judging not just on what was done well, but also what was adapted well. This makes my review more stilted towards a positive review and should be seen as such.
I really liked this adaptation, even compared to other manga or LN's I've read before their adaptations. I want to section this review into animation/sound, narration, and characters.
Animation and Sound: I thought the animation for this was absolutely top tier. I had
                  heard there were Studio Shaft animators hired for this project that had jumped to A1 Studios and it really shows. I get real Monogatari vibes, and that never really ended from the visceral backgrounds to the interesting close-ups, transitions, and stills. Vibrant colors contrasted the darker tones of the school uniforms and backgrounds constantly. Past this the emphasis on over the top emotional moments of dread or romance with similarly excessive animation really added some life to the narrator and the show. Essentially these were used to great effect to emphasize similar feelings that only the narrator could really pull off in the manga.
Narration: While I don't just mean the narrator for this portion, I want to say that the narrator picked for this was absolutely phenomenal. I was always wondering how they would adapt the narrator from the manga who almost acts as an ""outside character"" with their own observations and comments about the situation. I was leaning towards a lighter voiced character (Similar to Okabe's from Steins;Gate) however the deeper voiced chosen actor pulled off the situations just as well. Narration went beyond the narrator though, as background sets played an important role as well as the title and subtitle screens. Constantly gags could be represented through over enunciation, bombastic title entrances for minor characters, or even background service to characters from the manga that really didn't play a part in the story (Maki, being the most obvious generally). Even then, side characters like Erika from the spinoff are seen pretty regularly as well, and added some flair to those who really have to read everything related to the manga.
Characters: Honestly, I don't have too many complaints about the characters. Their voice actors did a phenomenal job, with a specific shoutout to Fujiwara's for really bringing the type of voice you'd imagine for that kind of whimsical character. Kaguya's VA really brought the heat with small witticisms and noises that are often just grunts or screeches in most other anime. While the male VA's stood out less, I think the writing that was taken from the manga really made up for it with the attitudes these characters show. Ishigami quickly became a fan favorite for anime only watchers, and his reactions to situations beyond his control (although he appeared later in the season) still left quite an impression.
Honestly, if you're not gonna watch this you should simply just go read it. However, if you're on the fence and unsure if this is the right thing for you, the show provides a good preview for much of the material and gags present throughout the series. If that's not your cup of tea, you might want to give it a pass, but if you want some decent romcom fun without too much of the drama (since most is played for gags) you shouldn't have to look any further.",8
"
                Kaguya-sama: Love is War is an interesting piece.  It's a very small story, in an objective sense, but its style makes it feel very big.  All the same, it's easy to connect to the characters, like them, and enjoy them for what they are.
The story is simple: Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane, the President and Vice-President of the Student Council, have fallen for each other... but are both too proud to confess first.  'Geniuses', they each hit upon the idea of using various 'clever' ploys to make the other confess his/her feelings.  Making matters complicated are the other members of the
                  student council: Chika Fujiwara and Yuu Ishigami, who they'll occasionally have to plan around (or have their plans interrupted by).  Each episode will consist of (on average) three vignettes depicting a 'battle' between our leads as they attempt to mentally outmaneuver their crush/rival.  Most of these events are, in real space, just conversations taking place within the Student Council room.  Sometimes we'll glimpse another environment, but since the Student Council is why our leads are usually together, it forms the most natural frame for their interactions.
If this sounds kind of dull and liable to be repetitive, that's because it would be... if the writing and production weren't smart.  Which they are.  The show doesn't just portray disconnected events, it actually does build up over time.  And each individual 'battle' isn't necessarily about the endgame (confession), but about some topic which is close to the hearts of our leads.  That helps prevent repetition not only because it means there's some variance in the 'game' afoot, but also because the characters can succeed or fail in the immediate even if you know they have to maintain the larger status quo.  There is some repetitive humor in here, but most of the running jokes are welcome, and don't feel like a waste.
The characters are also pretty simple... at first.  And some of them stay that way.  Fujiwara and Ishigami aren't the most fleshed-out or developed characters.  However, the purpose of their existence is to be foils for our leads.  The leads are better studied, but the show does it in a slow burn sort of way.  We gradually learn about Shirogane and especially Kaguya, and develop them bit by bit.  Some of the development may seem like it's hamfisted (the narrator will just tell you things) but it doesn't matter if you tell if you show as well... and this show does.  Some of the best parts are in the last few episodes, when it knows that the games would be a little old if there was no variation, and so we delve deeper into Kaguya's situation and psyche.
The real star, though, is the art.  What makes Kaguya-sama interesting is the fact that the mental battles, taking place are represented with elaborate fantasy sequences, melodramatic lighting, and so on – dramatizing the events without claiming something objectively dramatic is literally going on.  The art knows what it wants to accomplish, and it achieves its goals in a clever manner.  The blending of literal, semi-literal, and non-literal imagery works to the show's advantage in a big way, and every layer has a lot going on, with good (if occasionally excessive) use of lighting and color.
The opening song is unreasonably catchy, and the voice actors do knock it out of the park in the end.  Like the characters, it takes a while for them to come into their own, but I think the winners there are Fujiwara and Kaguya – the former for expressing a loud character in exactly the right way so she's not annoying (more than she's supposed to be in moments here or there) and the latter for having a much wider range while remaining 'in character'.
I wish there were more to say about this one, but ultimately I think it just is what it is: a good show.  Even if you're not normally into romantic comedies, Kaguya-sama is worth the watch for its clever visual storytelling and ultimately its character study of its lead.  I'd happily recommend it.

"
                I leave this website for two months and when I come back, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood has been dethroned. On MyAnimeList. By a romcom no less. This is the type of news that would get me raving. You're telling me that MyAnimeList has let go of its clear bias towards action shows and so-called deep philosophical masterpieces in favor of a vanilla slice of life romcom with no more aspiration than to be a comfy watch?
If you were to come to me before this re-watch, I would have sighed in disappointment at the name of this anime. After all, I was someone who didn't use overrated
                  much, but would definitely use that term for Kaguya sama: Love is War. But you got me, anime community, for once I will agree with you. Kaguya sama is definitely better than average. Enough fretting, more reviewing.
Kaguya sama is a seemingly unremarkabe romcom with one major hook: instead of our protagonists dilly-dallying, trying to figure out their feelings for one another and coming to terms with them, we only have the last and much better third, enacted by the academical elite of a high status school. I say academical elite instead of intelligent because, as the anime will show you, they are very hopeless in any social situation, bringing the crux of a comedy in this show, and bringing me to my next point.
Kaguya sama is not a romcom, I know I used this term at the beginning of this review, but do not come at this show with such expectations, that was my major mistake in my first watch. Instead, follow the website's tags, which weren't there back when this anime was airing. Kaguya sama is a comedy with romantic subtexts. Meaning that while the romance is there, and it is progressing, and has moments where it takes front place, it's still a comedy first and foremost. 
But now that I've argued semantics, just how good is Kaguya sama as a "" comedy with romantic subtexts""? I think I'll use comrom instead.
Honestly it's really good. As a comedy, Kaguya sama might be in my top 10. This may not mean much as someone who's pretty weak to comedy, so let me expand on this. The comedy style of Kaguya sama stands on a pretty large crutch: that is the presence of the narrator, acting like both a door to the character's subconscious and a set-up to the joke, adding a layer of depth to the Manzai type of comedy that characterizes so many comedy anime thus, adding to the joke.
Now let's talk about the production value. Yes, production value, in a damn comrom, probably where the production should be the least significant. Well let me tell you, that first episode was still straight up orgasmic, if A-1 productions is capable of this level even semi-regularly, then they would be part of the big hitters in the industry. Like see that first episode. Straight up orgasmic how good it is. It does fall off later but it manages to maintain some pretty high standards.
The one thing falling behind would be the romance. As I said, it's pretty good, and even manages to get some high moments, but a good romance needds to be built up, and as far as these twelve episodes have offered, the romance hasn't been anywhere near as satisfying as the main compnents of Kaguya sama. Perhaps in part due to the side cast, although I wouldn't wish them to be removed in any way. I guess this one season just hasn't been enough, or that it didn't effectively use its time, or maybe that the gradual build up faded due to its more episodic style of production.
All in all, Kaguya sama remains a very good show, only a stone's throw away from making it to the greats. And y'know, looking forward to the romance getting up to par.
Edit: Fuck it, Kagyuya sama is one of the greats, get in the bag big boy.",9
"
                Slight spoilers to follow that spoil nothing if you've ever watched a pointless anime romcom to follow:
This show is hilarious and it really brings the happy feels but in 12 episodes they make 0.5% progress towards maybe eventually dating one day. After 12 episodes they still can't even text each other or ask each other to spend time with them. The sad thing is this show would be a 10/10 if they just started dating and continued the exact same goofy power struggles but the frustration of the fact that nothing moves forward at all really cuts back on my ability to enjoy the show.
If
                  you are okay with a romcom where nothing happens you should absolutely watch this, or if you just really want a short feelgood romcom then go right ahead. But if you are coming here wanting any kind of actual plot development you've come to the wrong place. It is a shame because I really enjoyed the show a lot.",7
"
                A decent premise spread way too thin across 12 episodes with little else in between. Reminds me a lot of Skilled Teaser Takagi-san, in that the dynamic between the two romantic leads is also incredibly uneven. Miyuki (the male lead/romantic interest) only gets the upper hand when Kaguya has screwed up, gotten distracted, or embarrassed herself without him doing anything. Kaguya also has anime ice queen rich girl tsundere syndrome and rich people with neglectful parents disease. Every other character is okay at best. If you're really into high school romcoms, the first 4 episodes are quite good before the series wears out its welcome,
                  and falls prey to Second Season When bait. By the end of the 12 episode run, the leads have gotten only slightly closer, and it closes where the first episode put us - right back at square one. The good parts remind me of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, but the bad parts remind me why I dropped Skilled Teaser Takagi-san.",5
"
                Disclaimer: I would recommend reading through this review after watching this show, lest I accidentally end up overhyping this series to you.
Kaguya-sama: Love is War. Although I haven't watched enough rom-com shows to have a discerning eye for every single bit of minutia, what I feel like this show nails the most is balance. 
The great thing about Kaguya-sama is that it is both a well-structured romance as well as a comedy. While one on its own would probably cause the show to suffer: too much romantic moments, and the story gets too sappy, but too much comedy, and the story could lose a connection
                  of the audience to its chatacters- Kaguya-sama manages to really balance the two excellently. (Obligatory ""And the manga does this even better"".) (No seriously, if you liked this show, I highly recommend you read the manga as well.)
In a similar fashion, the character interactions are like salted caramel. Mix the finely developed salt from the mishaps that ensue between the main two characters (and sometimes four) with the sugary moments between those same characters, and you get something truly heart-warming that's easily worth enjoying. That isn't to say that this show is perfect. As a standalone case, in fact, this show would really suck if it ended where it did, and if a second season wasn't just around the corner this April. Besides Chika, who is simply an agent of chaos and doesn't need to grow in the slightest, characters besides Kaguya and Shirogane haven't had too much time to mature (at least, compared to what Akasaka shows us in the future). But given the story we have in 170+ manga chapters, that really isn't a glaring problem so much as a cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more- and more importantly, delivers on those desires, if you've managed to go beyond the anime.
As for the show itself, the situations set up are great, and always seem to resolve themselves in either hilarious or heartwarming ways. From ""Shirogane's and Chika's volleyball training"" episode to the ""Kaguya coaches Ishigami"" episode, and the ""Kaguya and Chika regress to 6th grade"" episode and the fireworks 2-part, there's plenty to chuckle at, meme the ever-living daylights out of, and just smile to. Quality-wise, the voices are great, and heighten each character, setting, and joke. Oh, and having Koyasu, aka DIO's VA, as Shirogane's father, was amazing. I can't wait to see him shine again in the few upcoming episodes he does reappear for. 
Both the OP (""Love Dramatic"") and the ED(""Sentimental Crisis"") are solid as far as storytelling goes; the former sets up the comedy, while the latter foreshadows the developing romance. Both can seem a bit boring and/or confusing at first, especially when compared to the crazy Internet sensation that is ED 2 (""Chika tto Chika Chika""), but the songs really do grow on you, or at least it did for me. Character design was also nice, with everyone having key differences that are played out nicely in the show(Kaguya's prestigious status vs. Shirogane's poor, hard-worker ethic; Chika's ditsy and often clueless nature plus her tendency to interfere and pull off the unexpected vs. Ishigami's sardonic yet often too aware nature plus his non-interfering tendencies and being pretty straightforward as just your typical nerdy NEET character). The building of common ground between more than just these cast of 4 characters (everyone being in the student council, as well as individual actions like Kaguya trying out line) also does wonders to solidify the various relationships, romantic or otherwise, as the narrative progresses. The sound design does its job excellently, highlighting the elegeance of Shuchi'in at times and creating comedic and/or romantic tension during others. And the art is amazing- generally consistent throughout most of the show, and at is most comedic, pairs with the soundtrack and character dialogue to really drive a joke even further.
As someone who likes to try out the top ranked shows to see what they're worth, Kaguya-sama was one of those rare cases where I genuinely couldn't find any abhorrent flaws, or anything bigger than nitpicks that felt out of place to what this show was trying to convey. At least, that's how I feel. 
If you're a fan of rom-com like I am, definitely consider coming back to this show. Maybe you don't have the same over-the-top reaction as I did, but unless you've had this show overhyped way beyond your expectations, or it's just simply not your cup of tea, you've probably found- or will eventually find- something to enjoy about it.",10
"
                This will be a short review ( I am not that fond of writing long reviews for the sake of over-critiquing anime, let's just have some fun talking about this).
MIND GAMES. These are the two words that immediately comes into mind when I started this anime. At first, I thought that it was quite weird that the two main protagonists kept on over-analyzing each other's thoughts. However, on a wider perspective, that is the main style that made Love is War so gripping and invigorating to watch. Each episode has its own story arch but it still manages to tie the emotions of the characters
                  throughout the series. I like how despite the intellectual and stern vibe that the two main leads show to the audience, the anime was still able to flutter my heart so bad as it was cute and refreshing to see intellectual characters act dumb-founded (in the presence of love). 
Delving deeper onto the technical aspects, the art style of the anime can be labelled as neat, although not the best one in that department. Surely, despite have just a neat art style, the characters does raise a certain capacity to become memorable for its viewers. As aforementioned before, its story truly is inventive. Having the characters play mind games with each other makes them more likeable and relatable (as in the real world, interacting with your crush can be a dangerous minefield and a frustrating strategy game). In that aspect, Love is War undoubtedly scored a 9/10 from me. Moving on, in terms of its characters, the male and female lead are extremely adorable and easy to get attached to. Their constant psychological conflict between each other in order to force the opposing side to confess their love first is a butt-clenching and enthralling experience. Aside from the main protagonists, the side characters (Chika and Ishigami) are really fun fillers to offset the seriousness that our ""intellectual"" main characters provide. They are silly, relatable, and charming. A true relationship between the characters has been effectively crafted throughout the anime.
Overall, I highly recommend that you try out and watch Love is War. If you have not seen any romance-centered anime which focuses on the two main leads having constant mind games with each other, then you should definitely try out this one. It is inventive, refreshing, and funny. If you want to grab some good laughs and make your heart flutter, then watch Kaguya Sama: Love is War.",9
"
                The biggest crime this anime commits is being animated by A1-Pictures rather than a competent anime studio. It's actually a crime that it wasn't produced by Shaft or 90s Gainax. A1 does not do justice. While they put up some decently animated scenes, this anime is absolutely carried by the amazing voice cast. The best thing the studio does is fulfill the proper comedic timing on a visual level to really push the voice cast's performance to the next level. If you're a fan of Japanese comedy, you'll love this.
One thing I'll never understand is people complaining that an episodic slice of life anime ""has
                  no story"". This is objectively untrue. The fact is, there is story here, there's just not a strong plot. That's not a bad thing. Plot is not necessary for a good story. It's present in a lot of good stories, but even in some of the best, plot takes a back seat to other priorities. With Kaguya-sama Love is War, the main priorities are being funny and exploring a strange and stupid romance. The romance being strange and stupid is integral to the comedy. 
I will never understand people attacking this show for having dumb characters. My brother in christ, that's what the premise of this story is based on. It's understandable if you're just not a fan of episodic slice of life in general, but acting like stories should never have dumb characters or be about day-to-day life, or that stories should never retread old ground in an attempt to find a new angle to look at a subject, is complete insanity. All I'm saying is you shouldn't approach a story looking for it to fit some pre-set criteria you have in your mind. Judge it for what it does.
Overall, if you like cute funny characters and an inconsequential story about the dumbest romance of all time, this is for you. If you're not a fan of episodic slice of life, stay the hell away from this.",7
"
                Childish. Childlike. That is what Kaguya and Shirogane are. Each other is their own first love. As such, it works so well in this story. It is their first time. They do not know what to do. Naive. High IQ, low EQ types. People might not like what happened in their story. But I like it. It is intentionally dragging so you would want more. Let us put our shoes in theirs. First love is the sweetest of all. 
Animation is great. Narration does a great job. OP and ED are perfect as well. Character development is just right. It fits right into the story.

"
                Let me preface this review by making one thing clear. This is show is a romcom. Going into the show, do not expect to be blown away by an amazing plot, or any sort of deeper meaning other than romance and comedy. If you are looking for something with an amazing plot, there are many good shows out there that you can watch, however this is not to say that one who enjoys a great story can't truly enjoy Kaguya-sama. 
The story itself is simply a following of some high school students and an observance of their relationships (platonic or potentially romantic). This isn't to
                  say that there cannot be a great plot to come out of this sort of setting, but Kaguya-sama doesn't expand upon any larger story because it does not need to. The characters alone and their interactions is enough to drive things forward. 
The main cast is headlined by a pair of two tsunderes who are utterly convinced that the other is in love with them, and the main purpose of each character is to get the other to confess their love. This concept itself is widely different than the normal trope of romcoms where both people don't want to confess their love because of a fear of rejection, instead both want the other to confess so their very fragile egos aren't completely shattered by being the one to confess. The 3 other central characters are enjoyable enough to where their screen time is merited, yet there is never a sense that the side characters take over the show. This is important because it allows for those moments in which there is a joke about their characterization, usually to their expense, to not be annoying or in your face. Are these moments played out sometimes? Yes, however, to me I liked the characters enough to where I was not necessarily bothered, but I can see where it may seem predictable or, bluntly put, stupid.
The characters themselves are all enjoyable in their unique way, and when given moments alone with one another, these characters are truly able to flourish. The characters may seem very typical and trope-y, however that is the point of the characterization itself. They are first described as these seemingly one-dimensional characters, but once they get moments one on one with each other, they are really able to show of their redeeming qualities (as a person/human, not a character). And a good romcom would be amiss if it weren't for its emotional points, which kaguya-sama is able to hit very well... for the most part. While Kaguya herself certainly has great emotional beats, her male counterpart, Shirogane, has emotional beats that do not feel nearly as substantial as Kaguya's. This is my one gripe with the overall emotion of the story, and I hope that S2 is able to remedy this in someway, but I'm not so sure if I'm necessarily optimistic.
Moving on to the art and sound, now, the sound is simply wonderful. All of the VA is great and you can tell that the VAs themselves were able to enjoy themselves while recording instead of it being a chore. Each character is very expressive and helps with their enjoyability. The various other sounds in the show are fine; there is nothing glaring that would bring down the performances of the VAs. As for the art, it is really well done, and many times is able to parody typical tropes in anime (I'm imagining some of the monologues of Death Note - ""I'll take a potato chip, and EAT IT!""), however there is nothing that is boundary breaking by any means, but as a casual viewer, it is very solid.
Now that I have said my piece, I strongly recommend Kaguya-sama: Love is War to any anime fan, even though it is not for all, it can simply be a fun watch. It also helps that it is only 12 episodes and does not require that much of a time commitment, and if you are not feeling the comedy style then you are free to leave the show early, there is certainly no obligation to stay in hopes that the comedy will become different towards your particular liking. Once again, it is a romcom, it is not for everyone, but anyone can still enjoy it nonetheless.",9

                Kaguya-sama is super good, the sub is the best sub I’ve ever heard, it works so well with the music. Kaguya and Shirogane work so well, even Ishigami who is a side character adds so much to the story, it’s wonderful. Kaguya-sama will always be in my top 5 anime because of the beautiful visuals and voice acting, I had to buy the manga because it’s just that wonderful, I’m waiting for the day I see season 2 release. Everyone should try this wonderful show out, you’ll certainly love it and will full in love with it. 10/10 story, 10/10 sound, 9/10 character, 10/10 overall

                Haha, I need to write this one: It's been a long time since I don't laugh myself to tears! This show is too much fun, really, really charming, and also manages to be very moving, when it needs to. Every single character introduced in the season (even the smallest ones) is a rock-solid creation, memorable, and full of life and surprises. What a ride! A masterclass in pacing, comedy, and romance, Kaguya-sama and friends will get the boredom out of your system and brighten the darkest of your days, no doubt about it. Don't waste any more time reading reviews about it, you're gonna love
                  its guts!

"
                Hoo boy, there's a lot to unpack here.
Kaguya-Sama is your classic Pride & Prejudice romance, except it's more like Pride & Pride, and then taken to the most ridiculous extreme imaginable.  I'm not sure whether I loved it or thought it was banal beyond belief, I just know I was having too much fun to care.
The titular Kaguya is the scion of one of the wealthiest families in Japan; she serves as Student Council Vice President in one of the country's most prestigious high schools.  Her foil is Miyuki, the Student Council President in the same school, who comes from the opposite background--lower
                  class and salt of the earth.  Both of them think of themselves as geniuses, and have the grades and reputation to back it.  And neither of them wants to be the first to admit they're in love with the other.
But knowing the premise only conveys half of what makes this show so unique and refreshing.  The idea could've been taken and turned into a typical slice of life dramedy/romance with a mild twist.  Instead, each episode is a trilogy of zany 6-8 minute skits, complete with a gameshow-style narrator and a declaration of who ""won"" or ""lost"" at the end of each.  It's utterly ridiculous, totally hilarious, and endlessly fun.  The ideas are often so incredibly asinine, like a contest over who gets to offer to share his/her umbrella, but exploited and pushed to such extremes that they become brilliant exercises in stupidity.
See, the key to this story about ""two geniuses"" is that they're both actually idiots in a lot of important ways.  We know it, and some (well, at least one) of the side characters know it, but Kaguya and Miyuki are so self-absorbed and arrogant that they can't see it.  Maybe that would make them too unlikable, except the series is peppered with moments where you see how their arrogance comes from insecurity, and moments where they show much they actually care about each other and their friends.
And that's the other side of Kaguya-Sama: The heartfelt, sappy high school romance hiding under all the absurdity.  It hides well, so the moments when it comes out are that much more effective.
This is a hard show to judge, though.  For one thing, it seems highly likely to receive a second season, and the story just kind of stops midstream.  It's also the kind of series where so much is invested in the humor of absurd situations that there isn't much space left to dig deep (though to its credit, the few moments where it does are efficient and powerful).  It's good at what it aims to do, I'm just not sure that its mission is going to keep me up at night pondering its depths.
There are also moments where I'm not comfortable with the way the show portrays power dynamics in relationships.  The obvious thing is ""Kaguya and Miyuki are hilariously wrong about how love works and the writer knows it"", but there are subtler things underpinning certain episodes which bely a somewhat-problematic perspective.  It's mostly not a big deal, but it was something I noticed.
Fortunately, the animation is fantastic.  The designs are instantly recognizable and fresh, and convey so much character.  The settings are interesting and a little bit different from the norm.  The sound effects and voice acting go hand-in-hand with conveying Kaguya-Sama's laser-focused purpose.  The music is a nice mix of catchy throwbacks and modern parody.
So, what do I think of the show?  Jury's out on its deeper merits, pending future episodes, but I enjoyed the hell out of it regardless.  I'll definitely watch the next season, should there be one.",8
"
                If i must describe Kaguya Sama: Love is War in one sentence i would say: ""The war of love bettween two genius teenagers. Firstly our main characters are: ""Kaguya Shinomiya"" who is our female main character. The second one is ""Miyuki Shirogane"" who is our male main character that loves Shinomiya. And there's ""Chika"" and ""Ishıgami"". (I love Chika so much she is so cute xd!) In the soundtrack part i can definetily say they did a good job. Especially the opening of the first season. It's like drug dependence or whatever you say. But in the character way i can't say that it's amazing.
                  If you're looking for deep character design in an anime i won't recommend  
Kaguya Sama: Love is War. Because you memorize everything of the character after watching 5 or 6 parts. Example: Chika is always  a cute and wimpy girl in the series. And always the good character that doesn't even can think about doing bad things to her friends. It overall gets a 7.",7
"
                I wouldn't call Kaguya-sama a masterpiece, even among comedy animes. But it definitely is a fun watch. 
It's a sketch anime, so storywise there's not much going on apart from the romantic tension between the two main characters, but there's not need to anyway. It has charming characters and a good sense of humor. Opening aside, the soundtrack is not very remarkable, and it's animation is fine for what it is.
If you like pure comedy animes (with a touch of romance), give this a try. It may start to get boring in the next seasons, but so far I would say it's worth watching (or
                  at least checking out). On the other hand, if you are not interested in comedy or romance, skip this one. You won't find anything here.",7
"
                I'm not going suck on this show's dick and claim it's the best show ever, nor am I going to take a demure stance and condescendingly proclaim this show is overrated. I'm just going to explain what I like and why other people should watch it.
TLDR: 6/9/8/10/10 Overall :8/10 for now, likely 9/10 as the show progresses.
Story: 6/10. There isn't much of a story: the show is a series of vignettes that highlight interactions between Kaguya and Shirohane, the two main characters. At the end of each segment, a ""winner"" or ""loser"" is declared by the narrator. Sometimes the ""winner"" seems to be chosen arbitrarily,
                  so it's def supposed to be taken with a grain of salt. What it gets right is taking the most mundane things, such as forgetting an umbrella on a rainy day, and turns it into an out-of-control fast-paced battle of wits. 
Art: 9/10. The character design and color schemes are great. The animation isn't anything to totally write home about, but I've never seen any flaws. The three mains all pop out. Kaguya has big red eyes, highlighted by her red bow. Shirohane has big bags under his eyes, evidence of his intense studying habits. And Chika has huge blue eyes and hot pink hair, a perfect match for her crazy personality while also serving as a foil to Kaguya. 
Sound: 8/10. Music is good, it fits the moments. OP and ED are good. Ep 3 has a special ED, make sure you stick around to watch it. 
Character: 10/10. The show shines here. Each character has a distinct personality, so all of the action and drama comes from how they interact. Kaguya is borderline sadistic, and puts on a sickly sweet persona when she's trying to manipulate someone. The story is told from an omnipotent perspective, so you can hear what's going on in each character's head in addition to what they actually say. Also, the narrative is great. He's so funny, and I haven't looked it up but I swear he's voiced by Speedwagon or some other memorable character. 
Enjoyment: 10/10. I laugh out loud several times each vignette. I didn't think I would like this show, and only watched because a friend literally made me watch Ep 1. Now it's the one show that I actually look forward to every week, and get mad when CR or Funi are taking their sweet time uploading it. 
Overall: 8/10. I can definitely see this score rising to a 9 though. Kaguya is my favorite character in a looooooooong time. If you like romance, thinking like Clannad or Your Name, this probably ISN'T the show for you. If you want a show that takes the ordinary and makes it utterly extraordinary, you'll like this. It's sort of like Sakamoto Desu Ga in that regard. 
It's a comedic character-driven slice of life told in vignette/anthology style. You won't see much slapstick, you'll see some fanservice but not a lot (as of now). Take what you will from that. But it's probably the funniest show I've seen since Blend S or Grand Blue.",8
"
                Kaguya-sama: Love Is War is a refreshing change of pace in the ever-battering tides of seasonal rom-coms. Its simple thesis of “The One Who Confesses Their Love First Loses” carries the entire season without having a strict plot.
Shows without a well-defined continuing storyline are difficult to pull off, successful examples being the likes of One Punch Man and Konosuba, and unsuccessful examples buried in a pile of failed seasonal trash. For a rom-com with little to no plot to be memorable, a miracle must occur.
Love Is War is that miracle.
By creating complex characters who live and breathe same as we do, the show practically writes
                  itself. Jokes don’t have to be thought of, the characters create them themselves.
By giving the two main characters “similar but different” personalities, it creates a Light vs L-style rivalry, with elaborate plots and schemes designed to force the other to confess their love. The cast of characters is so strong, the “best girl” argument war will surely go on for months, if not years.
On the topic of characters, the show also boasts some of the most memorable background characters, one of which (Chika Fujiwara) going down in meme history for one of the most elaborate anime dance sequences in a long time.
When an emotional turning point occurs, the show won’t turn around and kill the mood with a stupid joke, instead relying on pacing in order to implement the comedic aspect when it is appropriate.
There is no EP 6 beach episode.
The show creates noteworthy scenes that pull at heartstrings and leave viewers thinking about it days and even weeks after a viewing. Overall, the show deserves a 9 out of 10. The only issue I had with it was thinking it would have a real confession at the end, and when a second season was announced, I was extremely happy that it did not.
Note: If you’re considering reading the manga as well, watch the anime first. There are so many little side stories that occur in the manga that supplement your experience instead of reading first and not seeing everything you read in the anime.",9

                - DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS -
- DISCLAIMER- No I am not joking about anything that I put in this review, I am 100% serious. No I don't like to write reviews but for this one I had to. I am not expecting anyone to read this review because I am very late (Dropped this anime 3 times) but on the off chance that someone does before watching this horrible anime, you're welcome.
- Today i'll be talking about the most overrated anime in fucking history, that is Kaguya-sama: Love is War. I'd like to start off by saying I don't know why anyone likes this anime. I
                  don't know how anyone could like this anime. The plot is SEVERELY LACKING, and what I mean by this is there basically is no plot. You're literally watching twelve episodes of a guy and a girl that are 2nd to 3rd years in highschool act like children. Basically just two stubborn retards who can't tell the other person how they feel, which is very unfortunate because had they done that, the plot would've been 10x better and more enjoyable. Since we got the topic of the plot and romance aspect being piss-poor and dogshit out of the way, let's talk about the godawful comedy. Since this anime has no plot and no romance you'd at least think the comedy was perfect right? Wrong that shit is ass, out of twelve episodes there is probably only two scenes that are actually creative, original, and funny. Episode seven needs to be deleted from existence and if you thought it was funny you honestly need to go aswell. Episode seven is a episode where they start talking about wiener jokes and it was very childish and cringe to watch. I find no reason to go into detail about the characters because honestly they aren't worth mentioning and I don't care about this review all that much, just had to let this be known. Not really too much to say about the art is was the only good thing in the anime. With that being said 5/10",5
"
                “Kaguya-sama Kokurasetai: Tensai-Tachi no Renai Zunousen” to me was a show I really wanted to hate, yes, I'm that person that never shares the hype easily, I stepped in very close-minded and biased to my bad opinion and was proven wrong at the end of the day. I would genuinely start off every episode with very low expectations almost looking down on the series that I would end up looking up just like Boa Hancock, however, a certain charm that comes with this show manages to convert my disappointment grin to a genuinely happy face at the end of every episode, and it wasn't too
                  long before I just gave up and approved the show to be that of a high quality, a show that stands up high among many, which is rarely the case in my experience.
The Rom-Com genre is always present every season but only rarely comes a show that excels at adapting the source material and preserving the identity of plot whilst nailing what makes an Anime successful and accessible. “Kaguya-sama love is war” doesn't just nail that, it makes you begging for more shows on the same quality and sets off a high roof for other shows to follow, it was one big fest of historically insane laughter, a rollercoaster that smasher your tiny pathetic heart into pieces as it waters your eyes as if it was a plant, all in the same episode when you least expect it. It has deffintelety found its identity this season and gained a lot of following from both its OG fans and a lot of newer ones, and what enabled most of that was its unique concept of romance that was probably its biggest selling point.
Story (8/10):
What can be described as a select of episodic consequences of actions which also have a big relational feel to them as several plot point can bring up past happenings, a race between two brilliant students that everybody looks up to on who will confess first, and no, it's not a delicate game of chess either, both of them fabricate all sorts of strategies to lead the other one into submission, while every day has its victor, sometimes it just doesn't work for either.
I'm sure we've all seen our fair share of rom-com shows to conclude that what this show, in particular, is one of a class, never have I seen a series with the same take, turning a desirable feeling (love) into an intense challenge that can create a lot of opportunities for comedy in the meantime.
The show feeds heavily on pop culture references, intense fights between two brains and strategies that can overthrow a country. It also tackles small elements of friendship and family, two themes that work together and are very relatable to most of us.
It is safe to excuse the fast pace of the storytelling as all episodes will end up focusing on up to three mini-stories all self-contained while still relating to the main goal of the plot which is a point because comedy shows can get a bit too daunting and repetitive if they took a slower route.
It seems that even a show that has comedy of all things as a priority, the plot kept hinting at a lot of deeper concepts you never saw coming, most of them are from backstories of the main cast, the like of which deserve a standalone series.
Art (8.8/10):
We never ask for the latest animation practices or the most fluid frame technology usage when it comes to shows that are not that concerned about their visual quality, but that was exactly what we got nevertheless, and you know what? That's a welcomed surprise.
The character design of all things looks very generic and slice-of-life-ish but it was the animation, the sudden dramatic background changes and the unfamiliar camera positioning that highlighted a lot of the motion than was needed.
Some of the minor scenes ended up looking very clean and fluid it got a lot of people's attention just for that, a two-minute short dance which very slick movement's that I'm sure was traced on top of a real performer which only helped its fluidity and consistency.
The color palette remained all bright and appealing to the eye, a lot of emphasis on primary colors that only get darker as the tone of the show shifts to something more serious.
Sound (8/10):
The overall performance was, great, just what's needed to not have you bash on the vocal quality of the show. As dramatic as some portions were, the voice acting felt just natural to deliver the same emotions spoken from the characters that it seems very believable and with no room for cringe-worthy performances.
Both the opening and the ending were so good they called up along the more popular shows of the season securing their own place in those popular Anime song quizzes with ease.
The soundtrack was suiting to the overall tone of the show, blending so much that it's not noticeable anymore, but it's there to highlight the other vocal element like voice acting and dramatic win blowing sound effects.
Characters (7.5/10):
In most similar entries of the same genre, the characters seem pretty interchangeable and not all that “of a depth”, there is going to be a vast selection of waifus and husbandos of course, a lot of figures will be favorites that get talked about all the time but that doesn't mean they are that well-written carrier of the plot precisely.
Aside from Kaguya, which has her name in the title along with other well distinguishable facial features like her red eyes that are viewed as a special trademark in the run of the show, every other character is so plain looking that they end up like shallow mannequins looking common side character trope, not going to lie, Shirogane, a crucial figure to the story as a protagonist can easily be lost between a crown of background characters which is not specifically the point from a show of this genre.
Another horribly written abomination is Chika, she's got a huge fan following behind her from performing a certain dance at the early stages of the show and to be honest, a doll in a puppet show looks way more interesting than her empty childish head and twisted nature of screwing up a handful of great moment which I guess had a hand in creating good humor, but compared to the other cast, she was just an abused punching bag of a comic relief that we really didn't need in a show that especially focuses on comedy as one of the main factors of its storytelling.
Enjoyment (9/10):
I think I've stressed what I really thought and ended up thinking about the series, what started as an old close minded fella with a closed mentality that bashed every aspect of the show ended up cheering for a second adaptation. I'd always have a respectable amount of a good time on every episode no matter how straight my face was at the moment I hit play on the episodes, the humor was hilarious, the sad moments were very down and gloomy and with a lot of sense behind them.
A generous amount of humor comes from the narrator himself that breaks down the fourth wall on multiple occasion making the viewer even closer to the scenery portrayed.
Overall (8.26/10):
This is one definitive recommendation from me, and I'm sure a lot of people do agree with me here. Without a doubt, it has some minor problems that can easily be ignored without sacrificing what makes the show unique and worthy of your time.",8
"
                Good grief where do i start with this one... Ok ok ok lets get down to the very core of this anime shall we? <sips fine amount of more or less sophisticated whisky> It is a romantic commedy kept in standard tone and shape. nothing original, spectacular nor breathtaking happens there. the story is non existent, there's only one main goal in whole anime and it is a bland and ego driven attempts of misalliance romance betwen two mid schoolers. Yes they are extrordinary talented and inteligent (like in all rom-coms) and they copmete with each other (again straight from the box) but its so
                  pointless that it hurts to watch. The guy (lets call it by names, a Plebeian) Very talented and working hard for his achievements, buuuuut a lower middle classer at most goes to a elite school for ultra rich snob descendants of ruler class. Yeah... like that'll ever happen. And the girl, Extremely talented  all arround well prommising descendand of (yes im going to assume that) a rulers of japan (maybe some reference to emperror?) extremely influential, godly wealthy and somehow lonely, well mannered, not spoiled and cheesy as an ordinary teenager? what kind of laboratorical enviroment are we to ocurre this outcome? i know its only a show but daaaaaayuuuumn.... its beyond stretched. Now let us talk about their struggles. Dear watcher i dont have good news. those are blatant, boring and infantile. of course there are some laughable moments across those 12 episodes but man theres no more than 6 trruelly funny. And i mean it. if there was no chica and shinigami it would be a grass growing show. Now lets proceed to character development. There is none. We start at two of main characters fealing minty for each other but too proud too show it at the beginning and we end up with two main characters fealing a bit stronger mint but still too proud to show anything more than formal responsibility to inrteract more with each other. I had high hopes looking on an public opinion for this one but i was dissapointed beyond imagination. i will watch the show to the verry end but after season 1 im going to wait and watch something better. it will last some time im sure. 6/10 is most i can offer this show after season 1.",6
"
                The first time I saw Kaguya-sama it was as a manga. At the time I paid no heed to it, and though it caught my eye as it became an anime, I still didn't think much of it. Little did I know that talks about how funny it was and a collection of Chika memes would drive my curiosity up the wall until I finally decided to binge it. 
Boy did it deliver.
It's a slice of life episodic comedy series with a relationship that already starts out formed, in fact the comedy is largely formed from this fact and the contrast with the mind games
                  played seemingly in opposition to it. I would describe them as a miniature version of a hypothetical Death Note romcom, employing mostly the hyperbole that the characters atribute to even the simplest actions and their attempts to manipulate the situation in their favor.
I personally utterly loved this show, but it's really banking on you liking the humor derived from the character's starting personalities (which don't really change) and this very anime-ish self-inflicted misunderstandings humor (in this case not by coincidental events, but rather due to the character's trying to manipulate one another or by completely misinterpreting things). If you like this solid but fixed characterization and that kind of humor,you'll have a blast with Kaguya-sama. If you don't, it might all go over your head.
Given the kind of show this is, there's not much more to say, but I do want to give a shout out to however came up with that OP. It's just jaw-dropping to hear and watch, there's a lot of creativity in it and in the EDs, not to mention small snippets of visual jokes that the show doesn't bring attention to, but work as nice easter eggs for those paying attention (say hello to the yeti on episode -redacted-).",8
"
                let me just say, I've never heard of this concept before.
It takes a new turn on an old cliche topic, Romance.
as most slice of life anime, it's based off romance. but this was quite different than any others I'd ever seen.
Story -  8 
Seeing as it is still a very repetitive topic, its only an 8, but it was still very good.
~the battle of who will confess first! it's an easily followable story while still being enjoyable.The overall concept is who will be the social underdog and confess first, making them basically a doormat to society since they showed weakness. the story takes on
                  a fight-like tension with each mini episode having a winner/loser. It's very well though out seeing as it has actual logical/psychological conflict. very good overall!
Art/Sound - 8
Very good. I enjoy the art style, Especially the intro and outro, exceptionally done!
my only downfall on art is Kaguya has a very large forehead, other than that, no complaints.
the intro/outro are topping the charts as my favorites of all time.
Character - 9
I love the characters in this story! they aren't super complex, making them easy-ish to read and relatable.
I especially enjoy the economic differences between the characters, adding lots of depth.
and not everyone acts the same, such as Chika Fujiwara, very upbeat and outgoing extrovert, and then the somewhat polar opposite introvert, Yu Ishigami. a lot of good interactions between round and flat characters and not all follow the same tropes. 
Enjoyment - 9 
Quite pleasing to watch and very easy to get caught up in the story! it hits most demographics, making it versatile for lots of ages/personality types to enjoy. 
OVERALL - 8
Very pleased with this show! lots of fun to watch and very amusing!
i suggest this show specifically for those who enjoy Romance/Light easy to understand stories.",8

                (No Spoilers)
Let me write you a scenario, a new anime comes out with a boy and a girl that meet in school and fall in love with each other. Along the way, they have wacky adventures with the help of side characters and subplots. There is a sad point, oh no! By the end of the show, they confess their love for one another and (only) hug, what show does this sound like to you?
You're right! It is (almost) every romance anime in existence! Doesn't that sound boring watching that over and over again? 
Enter Kaguya-Sama: Love is War.
Whoah!! A good romance show?? That is
                  funny?? And has likeable characters with a good story that makes you wish for more??? Now this is epic.
Story: 10/10
The story of Kaguya-Sama is about two student-council members that are on a simple mission: get the other person to confess to them, simple right? Each episode has about three to four sub-episodes, all with their own story for each character (or multiple characters). The way the show executes the story and dialogue makes for some memorable moments. The story itself as the show progresses gets better and better, as you get into the perspective of their world. I would get into this more but I wouldn't want to spoil anything.
Art: 10/10
The art is good. I am not a critic of art which means I do not know how to judge this section, and I have nothing to complain about, so sue me.
Sound: 10/10
The execution of the sounds of the lines and scenery in this show is enough to satisfy any person watching the show, nuff said.
Character: 10/10
Alright guys, let's get into the characters.
Shirogane/President: I would want to be friends with this guy. He is smart and direct (and gives great love advice). As the president, he fits the role perfectly, with a good balance of humor and seriousness. There is not a scene he is in where I am not entertained. His cleverness when he battles Kaguya mind to mind is well executed and entertaining. Great guy would be friends with him.
Kaguya/Shinomiya: The main girl of the show, she fits the role as vice president very well. As well as the president, she is smart and direct, and tends to have the most entertaining dialogue and execution of her ability to combat the president. Her personality definitely shines in this show, as she tends to flip-flop back and forth between serious, flirtatious, happy, etc, which leads to some humorous moments. Definitely a good tier waifu.
Ishigami: Although he is the treasurer of the student council, he gets the least amount of screen time out of any of the main characters, which is a shame. His depressing tone and attitude leads to some hilarious moments, as well as one of the best lines in the show, ""I want to die, so I am going home."" I would love to see more Ishigami as the show progresses to more seasons.
Chika Fujiwara: Alright boys strap in. You want a top tier waifu? This show delivers. From the first episode to the last, she delivers everything a character in an anime should. With an amazing balance of clumsiness, humor, and all-in-all amazingness, she is definitely the best character in the show (come at me with your opinions haters). She delivers some of the best scenes in the show, from the outro in episode 3 we all know and love, to when she plays board games with the rest of student council. I could write an essay about Chika in this show, but just watch it for yourself man she's a great character.
Side Characters: Some of these characters include: 
Ai Hayasaka, Kagaya's best friend house maid that stays by her side and gives her love advice.
Side Couple: Two students that go to their school that constantly go to Shirogane and Kaguya for love advice, they are well written and liked.
Adolphe Pescarolo: Student Council dude that runs it, the only character in the show I didn't like, however the French exchange student dance with him in it led to a really funny scene, so whatever.
Enjoyment: 10/10
This show will always be one of my favorites, and that is because of its way of executing everything. From the timing of humor to the feels you get from it, you will never want to drop this show. Each episode delivers top tier content, and by the end of every one, you will think, ""whoah 20 minutes went by so fast!"". I cannot express how enjoyable this show is.
Overall/Conclusion: 10/10
Just watch the show already, Crunchyroll, VRV, Funimation, whatever. Kaguya-Sama delivers something only very few anime can do, and that is entertain me, and I am 100% sure you will be entertained by it too.",10

                If there's something I learned watching anime and who produced them, is that A1 pictures is not a particularly good studio in terms of Good stuff/Bad stuff ratio. Space Brothers, Shinsekai Yori and Silver Spoon are undoubtedly excellent in their own ways, I've yet to see Tsuritama and it's openly discussed if Your lie in April, Magi and Erased and other anime are either excellent or decent. Then you have a massive load of horse shit (Oreimo, 7 deadly sins, SAO, Ecchi Tail, etc).
Why that long prologue? Simple: Kaguya sama love is war is currently part of the 2nd group discussion and I'm one of
                  those who consider this series is good in spite of critical flaws here and there.
Starting with the most obvious aspect: the animation begs to be compared with Shaft works! The director of Kaguya sama worked in Arakawa under the Bridge (which I can't recommend it enough) and this style of animation fits unexpectedly well to show us how the usually calm council room is nothing but a mine field for our MCs. Some neck tilting here and there and there you have it. In terms of production they polished as much as they could the raw, basic style of the source material (sorry Akasaka). However the consistency of this art begins to fade in some episodes which makes me feel a little bit disappointed because until episode 8 the animation and art style were excellent. Putting aside the vibrant opening Love dramatic, I wasn't very enthusiastic with the OST, a bit basic and dull sometimes. The main ending is decent, and even though I dislike Chika dance, the animation was the most fluid in the entire series.
Now that the technical baggage was put aside: why I consider this romcom good? Simple: it tried to follow the path of actually good romances of before, especially Kare Kano and even though it wasn't as good as the aforementioned anime it has it's own charms
The premise already bought a lot of people: the main characters are already sure that they have a crush on each other so the only thing left is ""when the hell are these 2 going to make a move?"" And they only want to force the other to make such move. Inner monologues of their mind games and dynamic animation go together to give the spectator some action in a genre where you'd rather expect a little Tsundere kicking the MC and the comedy is actually pretty self aware of romcom cliches (like Gintama mocking action shounen or Konosuba kick the shit out of RPGs and Isekais). The structure of each chapter being between 5-6 minutes of different situations helps more than it's given credit for in order to let the spectator have a couple seconds to relax  otherwise this 
Both characters are supposed to be the smartest people at school, but when someone is in love the intelligence drops a bit, especially when giving advice to newcomers (I'll speak of them soon). Like every romcom, they have to work out the nonsense and control their massive egos, which they actually are starting to do in almost compelling ways. Fortunately the manga shows us how these egos were born and raised by different circumstances, but the anime hasn't reached this yet so it's understandable if people were let down waiting for more of their backgrounds (especially Miyuki). This chemistry starts with an ""ok"" to ""why you like this person, again?"" ending with ""oh, I can see it now!"", nothing vomit inducing like in harem stuff, Otome stuff or God forbid, NISEKOI!
As I said before, the self awareness in the series is accurate enough through the presentation of Hayasaka, the maid and Ishigami, the ""favorite"" of the author. Starting as the punching bag and ending as a closer friend of the main couple and retroactively through his relationship with them both parts show and develop more traits. Each time this guy appears is not wasted time, I promise!
Pros being said I have 3 large problems with this series that were in the manga too.
1) Kashiwagi and her BF. Using not one but 2 characters as plot device and compare them with Kaguya and Miyuki would be fine if they hadn't begun like they did! Also they are more of a contrivance 
2) Chika Fujiwara. This is the main element of chaos in the series that appears right a the moment where someone would think the war is over. It's funny the first 2 times but after the 3rd one I was immediately tired. Even though her issues with best emo Ishigami (Spoiler: they won't be together, fortunately) are enjoyable from my perspective, I'm just not into her character in general, though I understand she's the main reason why this anime had this popularity 
These problems are nothing against 
3) The narrator. Exposition is stupid, and so is this. The only times this narrator worked were in 2 gags, other than those this unknown narrator in 3rd person is my biggest problem with the series. It doesn't allow to enjoy the actual mind games or how the plans of the main couple are blown out. Had this narrator never existed in first place, perhaps I would have genuinely loved the anime.
In conclusion: is this another generic romcom? No. The self awareness and development of events and main characters are good enough and the animation helps in great ways to surpass the cons Kaguya sama has. If you are into romance anime, then I can say this is for you. If you felt disappointed with melodramatic high school romances with japanese comedy focused on fanservice, this also has fun with this trope too! 
PS:Today's results.... good Romcom genre has returned!",7

J.R.R. Tolkien, Author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings 
Love is but a challenge we all must face, either by learning it through our fragile emotions or through the burning sensation within our hearts! 
Hiya and Welcome to my review of "" Kaguya-sama: Love is War! "" I am The Anime Logician and I review anime, as well as Manga and other things that delve into the world of Anime and Japanese culture. After seeing season one I realized I had to review it, so let's
                  get started, shall we? 
Story: The story takes place within the walls of Shuchiin Academy, student council president Miyuki Shirogane and Vice president Kaguya Shinomiya seem to be the perfect match, but both being too prideful. Neither Miyuki nor Kaguya care to show their feelings, as they see the one to confess their love first, would most likely be the loser of the battle of love. 
The story is filled with the many schemes to have each of the main characters show affection or confess their love to the other. In this case, it makes the anime more interesting and more appealing, as these schemes lead to much laughter and the romance is in my opinion "" The icing on the cake "". Therefore I do enjoy the story, very much.  
Art: The art was great, but was it perfect? When I think ""Perfect"" I think Demonslayer, when I think awful I think of things like Boruto and One Punch Man season 2. To me the art was great, did I see any wrongs? Nope. In this case I will call it perfect. 
Sound: The sound... How can we forget the sound? All I need to say about the sound is ""Chikatto Chika Chika"". Great song, Great dance moves, and A great meme!! The opening is great too, but the closing takes it. 
Character Development: The characters in this anime are amazing, especially with my favorite being Yu Ishigame. As an INTP I can understand Yu perfectly! The guy is always thinking, he is introverted, and is a true shut in. He doesn't understand emotion as much, but as soon as he analyzes something, he understands it perfectly. That's probably why he's great at playing video games and at being treasurer. Overall I love the character development, really great stuff. 
Personal Enjoyment: I enjoyed all of season and it was something new to me. Personally I feel irritated that I hadn't watched it when it was first released, but watching over 400 anime titles I realized I would get back to it, at some point in time. The anime was funny, as well as emotional at times and It's an anime that has replay value.
Verdict: Some people say this anime is overrated, some say it's perfect, some say it's great, and some say it was carried by it's memes. In this case I believe it was perfect, also the memes for this anime weren't even close to being annoying! I don't even see why that would be a concern when we are reviewing an anime here, not a meme. With that being said my overall score for Kaguya-sama: Love is War is a.....
Overall Score: 10/10 PERFECT!!!!! 
I wasn't the biggest Rom-Com fan, but if thanks to this anime; it's official. Rom-Coms are now a favorite genre of mine and I hope to find more of them, that are unique and great :D",10
"
                I'm not sure what I was expecting when I picked up this anime. My plan to watch list has gotten so large it takes me like 10 years to adopt animations that have come and gone, having bathed in their spotlight and retired from the collective thoughts of the community. So when I finally got around to watching this I didn't remember why it was in my PTW in the first place, I'm sure it's because I saw the Chika Dance though haha. Anyway, I was pleasantly entertained, and I'm excited that a season two is currently airing.
Story - 10. This animation is an absolute
                  riot. Every episode I was laughing. After making a gif for each of my favorite scenes for the first three episodes to send to my friend, I had to resist the urge to do so for the remainder of the series. The delivery was spot on. Their angle was clear. It was established by a narrator as a psychological battle between Shinomiya and Shirogane about what the other is thinking, and how they can manipulate each other into confessing; and the animation stuck with that idea up to the very end.
Art - 10. I really liked the art, the simplistic drawing of the characters for the nonsensical scenes, the over exaggerated detail as a stab towards normal anticipation building techniques, the use of lighting to set the tone, and of course, that fluid motion for the Chika Dance.
Sound - 10. I think this was well done as well. While I didn't pay necessarily chose attention to music during this animation (the characters had me sucked in), it certainly wasn't in the way, and lent strength to very powerful scenes when it DID matter.
Character - 10. A little different from my usual. I usually expect there to be heavy character development, especially in romantic animations as it helps me, the audience, to be drawn to, and relate to the main characters, and to eventually root for them as they overcome their trials and tribulations. However, these characters are very transparent about who they are, and that doesn't change throughout the entire series. I think the reason why I was okay with is is because we got to see the character from his/her opposite's point of view every episode. In real life, that's often the only perspective we get, and in a weird way, that still makes the characters relatable enough for me to root for them.
Enjoyment - 10. As a comedy, I give this full marks, and they never left the romantic aspect either, except for Chika, who was blissfully unaware. It's 100% what I was expecting and extremely enjoyable to watch. Lately, I've really been watching anime along side doing work of some sort. That was impossible with this anime. I could not take my eyes off the screen for a second, because blink and I'd miss the 1 frame that caused more massive, silly, chaos for our heroes.
Overall - 10. I'm very satisfied. I don't know if I meant to give full marks in every category, and I'm sure if I thought hard, I could come of with some criticisms, but right now I'm on a high from having just finished the finale. The finale was quite unique too in my opinion. I liked that it was a powerful moment, and they gave it a really strong conclusion, that again, had me laughing like a hyena.",10
"
                War is never stagnant. It follows a wave of battles, each with their own victories and losses, and new conflicts that spark new developments within the conflict. Kaguya-sama showcases the progression of its own kind of war, one between two of the most calculating of strategists in a war completely foreign to them. 
Story: Kaguya-sama follows the basic school life format of a calendar year, but with the added twist of showcasing what happens during this time. Although these areas with timeskips usually are resolved with ""nothing happened"", they work in with the show due to the nature of the characters. However, although working well,
                  I felt that this was used as an easy way out of a choreographed timeskip. Instead of utilizing the same excuse over and over, I feel that more comedic antics could be put in place, explaining the fact that the characters are not doing anything while also developing characters and giving a humorous look at boring day-to-day life. That one complaint aside, the story works well and frequently looks at the core of the story in each episode. In every episode, the main focus is highlighted and affects character actions, especially with the 2 main characters. In most shows of this type, previous character actions are not the main driving force behind future actions. However, what Kaguya does is allow for this to occur utilizing the character backgrounds. By having 2 calculating geniuses, the show is able to create consequences that arise due to previous actions. This greatly benefits the show and story as seen in later episodes, where an action usually leads to further conflict that affects decisions. Without a clear vision of characters, the story would not make as much sense as it does.
Art: Animations are plentiful and in a large variety of styles. Action-esque scenes are used, minimalistic scenes, and a variety of casual and ordinary animation is used. These heavily contrast with each other especially with backgrounds as scenes play out. With the episode segment focusing on the president learning volleyball, Chika is given the most flexibility with her animation styles and expressions. In the animation department, you can tell that attention was put towards keeping everything fluid. From the Chika ED to regular scenes, nothing seems choppy, even with the intense battle like segments between the members. If you can manage to make a card game have animation flow well, then that tells you how great everything else is. The artstyle itself is a tad bit minimal in how shadows don't exist, but that serves to compliment the mood of the show. Shadow effects exist only when something serious occurs, marked by the soundtrack changing.
Sound: Besides stellar voice acting, particularly from Chika, the show also boasts a great soundtrack. Unlike my previous review on A Place Further than the Universe, I remember most of the tracks as they don't focus on using warm strings that are meant to be under the dialogue. The show instead features tracks that are meant to accompany the dialogue and not to support it. This allows for greater impact to scenes that show you the difference between scenes that will have an impact in the future to those which are less important.
Character: Kaguya-sama boasts great character development within the run of the 12 episodes. From start to finish, you learn and see more of the characters and how they act more and more towards their true intentions. What this means is that characters are never static, and even the deuteragonists have a role that is constantly changing alongside their characters. Chika starts off as the staple positive character that doesn't have a care in the world to becoming the comedic relief that tries her best to keep up with the minds of the two smartest in the school. Ishigami himself also finds development amiss the constant ""I want to die, so I'm going home"" quotes. However, the most development is seen with the two main characters, Shirogane, and Kaguya. Both start out as two egotistical admirers who wait for the other to lower themselves in order to take control of the situation. Throughout the course of the show, this changes to showcase characters who hang by a thread when it comes to resisting the urge to act how they really want to. The story helps this development happen, with their inabilities to show their true feelings causing the eventual openings the characters show as a result of their love growing. As they act colder to each other, their affection seems to grow as well. This comes to a tipping point towards the end of the series as you see that acting on urges becomes harder and harder to control when compared to the simple admiration from the beginning. Overall, the characters work in a way that develops each other, creating what could be one of the best usage of chemistry in a show such as this one.
Enjoyment: Every moment of this show has something, and that's reflected in my enjoyment. I very much enjoyed this show from start to finish. Every aspect of this show is done extremely well, and they boast the ability to not just work well by themselves, but also with each other. There is never a moment wasted in this show on filler or antics that don't serve to progress anything, which works well in its favor as a 12 episode series. While I do find the current season to be a very well done run, I really do want to see more come from this series. The show accomplished a lot, but I want to see if it can do even more, and possibly do it in a way that completely blows this season away.
Overall: I have high expectations for where this series could be headed. It's proven that it can create a well-balanced concoction between each and every element within the show to the point that you can't find too much fault in anything. That in itself is the reason why the show is successful. From the way the story affects itself to the development of the characters, this show gives itself an amazing showcase that is sure to give you a great experience.",9
"
                TL;DR Review
""Love is War"" is a great romcom anime. Both the characters (who are in love with each other) are open books; unfortunately they both don't know how to read. This becomes quite a problem later on in the anime. However, there is no progression in this anime. It's three steps forward, three steps back. Some of the jokes are pretty predictable, making it less fun to watch. However, that's rare.
Nonetheless, I personally enjoyed watching this anime, but a tip is to not expect too much going into this. The main characters never go out, but that was very predictable since the second episode. Chika
                  is always the one cockblocking, but that was very predictable as well.

                Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen is one of my favourite anime so far. The creators managed to make this show really stand out from other series of the romance genre.
What I like the most about the story is that events really make logical sense, there are almost no coincidences in this show. Thanks to that the progress of the plot seems realistic and we are more engaged. The reason why I bring this up is how it affects the narrative. In many shows, events happen by chance and those make the relationship between characters grow. In this anime it is not the case.
                  Two main characters have the battle of wits and try to outsmart the other person so they do a certain action. The show really praised courage and taking the initiative which was shown by the development of the relationship of supporting characters and an event when not praying for the luck was rewarded but taking an action. The anime persuades that we shouldn't hope for something to happen and expect it to happen. It tells us that we must take matters into our own hands to grant our wish. When it comes to comedy, the show made me laugh many times and it was well-balanced so viewers don't get bored. The battle of wits parts felt satysfying to watch and unexpected events turning the tables made battles stay fresh. There were also dramatic moments which genuinely made me sad and sympathise with characters.
The art in this anime is amazing. The play of colours which represent both sides of the ongoing battle of wits. Visualisation of characters' inner thoughts and anxieties is top-notch. Feelings of people are supported with fitting background or colour changes. The art style is dynamic and realistic most of the time and fits the story well. Scenes are often exaggerated for comedy purposes, but it doesn't feel as if they were forced and out of place. The opening is astonishing in my opinion and is perfectly synchronised with music. Characters and scenery are well-drawn.
The music reflects feelings of characters and situatuions very well. The opening song is amazing and is one of my most favourite ones. I've already listened to it many times and I didn't get bored of it. The voice actors did a great job in showing the characters' nature. The sound effects are of good quality. The narrator's voice was perfect and really added to the comedic effect of the show. The fact worth noting is that the cast isn't made out of the most popular voice actors and I'm happy with this because it helps other talented people be discovered and make the show more special.
All the characters were unique, even supporting ones. None of them was without a flaw or without something positive about them. Viewers could relate to them and their problems which differed on account of their financial condition, their traits etc. The narrator was top-notch, as I said earlier, and it felt as if he was necessary because without him much of the comedic effect would be gone.
The show was really enjoyable. The comedy, interspersed with romance and drama, resulted in me not being bored or thinking that the humour was just forced. I think many people, even those who didn't have much contact with anime at all, would enjoy watching it too. Watching the series for the second time would probably make many people like the show more because it's easy to overlook the moral and essence of the story which, of course, can differ depending on the person watching it.
In conclusion, I rate Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen 10/10 and recommend watching it for every teenager and young adult.",10

"
                What a weird concept, the idea of the fights between the two main characters doesn’t really have any reason. This hurts but the childish antics that follow are usually quiet funny. With hilarious characters that I appreciate wholeheartedly, this is a definite win for the best couple award.
Story – 5
It’s incredible repetitive in the first 9 episodes. You want the characters to win, but they can’t. I think the final episode is particularly good and varies from the rest of the story in a compelling way. 
Art – 7
There are some masterful reaction shots and fluid motion in this series, but aside from that it’s
                  nothing special.
Sound – 8
Holy Shit, the voice acting in this series is phenomenal. You can hear everything and it brings depth into every line said. Good job voice actors. The op is not bad, I was unsure at the start but it grew on me. The 2nd Ed on the other hand is a big yikes from me. Although chika’s dance is good.
Characters – 7
The main characters are kind of the normal boring super smart characters that you see everywhere, but they have some great scenes opposing each other. it’s fun to see the cogs turn. The side characters are very good as well.
Kaguya is the smart rich girl that has some very funny scenes when it comes to anything lewd.
The president on the other hand is the opposite, reacting to a lot of very mundane things.
Ishigami is the nerd character that can’t get anyone. He is terribly frightened by Kaguya and this leads to some absolutely comedic gold.
How could we forget Chika, she is the best thing about this series. she makes every scene hilarious and absolutely ruins the plans of other at every turn.
Overall – 7
Not a masterpiece, very good, but not a masterpiece. The characters are fun, but it gets very formulaic very quickly. I would recommend, but I don’t think it’s very important.",7
"
                    So…I really don’t have any strong feelings towards this anime one way or another but as far as watchability goes I would still say it couldn’t hurt to put this on your list. Now, full disclaimer, when I was STRONGLY encouraged to watch this anime it was under that pressure that all anime-watchers get. You know what I’m talking about. When someone absolutely adores the show and they want you to absolutely adore it as well. I kept seeing it everywhere and most of the comments were so hyper and excited for the show’s return. I didn’t want to go into
                  the show with incredibly high expectations, but I was still intrigued as to why it’s such a fan favorite. 
     Personally, I could have gone without seeing it. The entire joke of the show is a great big, “Will they, won’t they” taken to extremes. If you grind your teeth and clench your fists at this popular romance anime trope then this show definitely isn’t for you. To my understanding, there are 4 seasons of this program so take what you want out of that. I think it’s because most of us have seen this, all of this, before and it doesn’t really add anything new to the genre. Honestly, it gives me anxiety waiting for someone to slip up or waiting for someone to show genuine emotion and not manipulative tactics. 
     Now to be fair there were instances where I laughed heartily or where I wanted to rewind to see a character make a joke. It does have that special Japanese humor that you can’t find in any other form of entertainment. I certainly had favorite characters that I was rooting for or felt sorry for so I can say it’s likely that you’ll form an attachment to at least one of the characters as well. It’s important that you give these characters a chance. Our two characters in love come from completely different worlds and their backgrounds couldn’t be any more different. And while they’re both teenagers feeling very healthy feelings it’s those different backgrounds that prevent them from acting on them in a healthy manner. So the show requires a healthy amount of patience from its audience for these two contrasting characters. 
     Lastly, something that I think viewers should know is that this is the type of anime where there is a LOT of writing on the screen. If that isn’t a problem for you and you prefer to watch dubbed anime where you don’t have to look at the screen then don’t worry about it. But if you’re like me and you NEED to catch everything written out to get small references then you’ll be pausing the screen a lot which can add to your viewing time. It’s also a little harsh on the eyes because the subtitles are generated in that thick, white lettering that can be blaring to the optics.
     Lastly, for real this time. if you watch the sub or dub you will get a different experience from your narrator. The sub narrator sounds like a general actually discussing the elements of war and tactics which is fitting because it IS called “Love is War”. However, the dubbed narrator sounds like a much younger person, your buddy jokingly watching it next to you. Do a YouTube search of Kaguya-sama narrator sub vs. dub and give yourself a taste to determine what kind of viewing experience you would like. I believe it makes a big difference.    
     Kaguya-sama: Love is War, season 1 isn’t something that you need to hurry up and run home to watch but I think, at most, it deserves a chance on your watchlist. For whenever you get around to it.",6
"
                This is a very fun anime. All the characters are so funny and enjoyable. I highly recommend it if you wanna have a good time and you like romantic drama. The comedy comes mainly from the exaggerated visuals and voice acting, and the opening is amazing. It reminds me of Ouran Highschool Hostclub sometimes.
While the comedy is very good, the more emotional scenes didn't hit as hard for me (specially the ending), they seemed a bit too dramatic for what they were.
I think the theme is very original, it literally looks like they have a love war between them. The narrator is a very fun
                  element they added, and both protagonists complement each other very nicely.

                So you're a high school student, madly in love, but you're a huge tsundere. Ah, that's cute. What's the worst thing that can happen? Well, one thing is to discover that your love interest is as big a tsundere as you are.
Kaguya-sama is basically a tsundere parody done by taking it to ridiculous extremes. Out two lead characters are Shinomiya Kaguya, the school's student council vice president and Shirogane Miuki, the president. Both are the top students in school and both have a crush on each other. Furthermore, they pretty much know that the feeling is mutual but neither is willing to make the first
                  move so they continuously attempt to manipulate each other to confess first.
A deliberately ridiculous narrator presents the story as a love war - where the first to confess loses and will suffer the consequences for eternity. Any sign of affection is a weakness and must be avoided at all costs.
Well, it does fit the romantic comedy genre but it's way more towards the comedy than romance. Nothing here will cause you to shed tears. No, actually scratch that, you will shed tears from laughter. The romantic parody genre is alive and kicking.",8
"
                Came to this anime with higher expectations, was a bit disappointed. 
This anime had an OK start, two main characters who see love as a battle where they want eachother to surrender first. That's fine by me but the whole thing became a routine after 3 episodes.
90% of the story takes place in the School's president room where they develop the 2 main characters, with the help of supportive ones such as Chika ( which I actually loved). It got to a point where I was skipping parts because nothing relevant happened.
And I think this is what made this anime boring apart from 2 episodes
                  (the one where Chika trains Shirogane for Voleyball and where Shirogane and Kaguya sleep together). Those were the most exciting episodes of this anime. 
Apart from that, everything else takes place in the same room, no huge development on romance.
Favorite character: Chika
Favorite Episode: Episode 9. 
If this anime would've developed its characters on an open environment, it would be much more enjoyable.",7
"
                I could never remember the time when I've laughed out loud repeatedly at an anime. Well now I could because I had a blast watching this.
At first, I thought this was going to be one of those generic slice of life, comedy that's not funny, romance that's never going to go anywhere , etc type of anime. I was even considering dropping it before viewing just so I could say I checked it out. Alas, I was caught off-guard in just the first episode which had me weak in the knees.
The story is basic generic anime high school stuff but with a twist. Intelligent boy
                  likes intelligent girl, intelligent girl likes intelligent boy but they don't want to admit it so they try to make the other admit it. For allegedly very intelligent people, they're so stupid it's endearing and entertaining.
Art is generic anime once again, but the animation is amazingly incorporated with artsy visuals to accompany what the characters are feeling or the mood of the situation. It's really nice.
I didn't find the music track to be especially outstanding except the you-know-what-dance, what makes the anime even greater are its voice actors. Their expressions are truly out of this world and over the top which fits in line to what this anime is, a hilarious comedy/romance.
The characters interactions are the main attraction of the show. As I've stated before, the main protagonists are so intelligent that they're f***ing stupid. Which should irk me in any other anime but the way they handle it here is great. The side characters are also entertaining but not as well-written as the main characters. They're really fun when they all interact together. 
If you want to lie down, shut your brain off and forget about your miserable life, this is the anime for you.
In conclusion, it's amazing. Watch it now.",9
"
                At the beginning of the year I did not know that I could find myself interesting, because I started this year without knowing anything about anything, I had no idea that anime would come out, I was totally away from that information, and what a pleasant surprise I had when the first series of the year I saw, It was, Kaguya Sama, and I just knew from the first moment that it was going to be my favorite of the year, I am a person who enjoys comedy too much, I live to watch comedy in the anime, and honestly, that caress to the heart
                  was This series, its characters along with their teenage follies saved my weekends, literally turned them into the best days for me, but when I realized, the series was about to end, and they would not believe how much it would suffer to accept that it was over It was one of the few season series that I wanted it to last forever, because kaguya sama became something that I will have in my heart for the rest of my life",10
"
                Seems overall very interesting series that describes perfectly the teenagers inability to deal with their own emotions. There are multiple examples of this in the series and most obvious one being the ""confession war"" between the two main characters.
This makes the series very easy to relate to for most people. The characters are written pretty well, which has allowed the whole plot to work to begin with. Without the mix of childishness with the high class upbringing and strong will to succeed at everything and anything in my opinion allows this ""confession war"" to exists as an idea.
Even if the main point of the series
                  is the ""war"" it still does not fail to describe different kind of emotions and difficulties they can produce, as well as proper way to deal with said emotions and/or problems they impose. (From simple hand holding to dealing with rumors.)
I have no qualifications to complain about the art or sound, so as long as they're not completely awful and off putting I'll rate them as good, for me the whole point of any series is the plot, story and characters, how well do these things mix and work together.",7
"
                It is by far one of the best romantic comedy anime I have seen to date, with a ridiculously smart way of using the will they won't they trope. Instead of having two characters that are obviously madly in love with each other, forcing the audience to wait or sometimes never get a romantic resolution. Love is War creates a much more absurd but ultimately devilishly impressive solution. The lovebirds simply have unreasonable levels of pride and an intense inferiority complex. Most romcom dilemmas that create stagnation revolve around the ""do they like me or do they not like me"" question, however our two leads
                  Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are instead SO convinced the other is in love with them and is about to confess. This in turn creates the doubts in the first place about whether the other likes them, a byproduct of the mind games, psychological warfare and impatient attempts to have the other confess sooner, or at the very least give in a little. A fascinating execution for romcom dilemmas if I say so myself, especially since that same pride and inferiority complex I mentioned is likely to be what brought them together in the first place.
All that on it's own is pretty solid for a romcom premise, but Love is War doesn't stop there, cause I haven't even mentioned a pink haired little joker in our deck of cards yet. The side characters of this anime have just as strong as a performance as our two leads, Ai Hayasaka, Yuu Ishigami, and even the presence of a fantastic narrator put on a great supporting performance. Ah yes, and then there's the joker of this deck, Chika Fujiwara, at first a she is seemingly nothing more than a ditsy girl who gets in the way of Kaguya and Miyuki, causing their plans to crumble spectacularly with maximum hilarity. In truth however she is a well-adjusted and competent enough girl to read the situations surrounding Kaguya and Miyuki, assisting them and driving them forward towards more reasonable approaches to solving their shortcomings. She still is unpredictable and a great comedy relief character, with on point reactions and comedic timing that made pretty much 100% of the jokes land. Super recommend!",10
"
                I enjoyed Love is War for roughly the first half. I liked the dynamic between all the characters and I genuinely laughed at a few moments. However, what started as an endearing and cute dynamic between Kaguya and Shirogane quickly became boring at best and annoying at worst.
I think if this show had leaned into the prideful genius aspect of both characters it could've been great. I enjoyed those types of characters in show like Death Note and I would've loved to see it done here.
What frustrated me most about this series was the fact that none of the characters got developed and by the
                  end of the 12 episodes, no progress was made. I was really disappointed that Kaguya was just the typical sad, lonely rich girl. I was hoping for something deeper and more unique. I never expected the main couple to get together by the end, but I would've thought there would be a bit more progress in their relationship. Sadly, there wasn't.
In the end, something I was hoping to be spectacular ended up being painfully average. If you like slice of life, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. As someone who typically doesn't, I was thoroughly disappointed.",6
"
                Confessing your feelings can be challenging and scary sometimes but what if there are two people who are too proud to admit their feelings to each other. Look no further than Kaguya Sama: Love is War. 
Kaguya Sama: Love is war isn't your typical rom-com. It's absurd and stupid that it works really well. It is downright hilarious and refreshing. The story follows Kaguya Shinomiya vice president of the student council and Miyuki Shirogane president of the student council who from the start obviously like each other but they are too proud and stubborn to admit their feelings. The show follows their variety of psychological
                  schemes to make the other confess their feelings first. Each episode is made up of vignettes focusing on the psychological warfare between Shinomiya and Shirogane as they best each other to trick each other to confess their love.
What I like about Kaguya Sama: Love is War is the amazing character development. At the start of the first episode, it is not hard to figure out that Shinomiya and Shirogane are very bratty and spoiled but as the show progresses, the characters are viewed in a different way. They do continue to be motivated by their pride towards each other but they also show their vulnerable sides to be very caring and very considerate. The way the show plays it off is so superb that you just want to root for them and at the same time you just want them to stop their nonsense, confess and get together already but you will still want to see more of their battle. The comedy is so unique and it has an incredible approach. The side characters are very fun to watch. Fujikawa and Ishigami are also part of the student and always find themselves in Shinomiya and Shirogane's war game. Fujikawa and Ishigami add so much uniqueness and their relationship is very entertaining. I personally liked Ishigami and him being scared of Shinomiya was just too funny and he himself should know the reason why. The narrator is also a central figure in the show. He does a splendid job exploring every single character.
Season 1 of Kagiya Sama: Love is War is explosive and engaging. Some moments felt creepy and a bit scary but it also had heartwarming moments. The psychological warfare between Shinomiya and Shirogane is just absurd and hilarious. It is definitely one of the best rom-com or at the very least very unique.",9
"
                Enjoyed  the  show a lot.  It  was funny, relaxing, and  cute  to watch.  Some  people are  hating because  they expected  a slice of life  plot is  what I'm  suspecting. This is a  rom com,  this isn't supposed  to be heart  tugging or anything. It's supposed to be  that   show that you can sit  down  and watch without having to analyze a lot of  things.
All  the  characters are  great, they  each have a defined  role. Another great
                   part  of this anime is that only  kaguya loved the   president and  no one  else. I hate watching those animes  where the  male  character has 2-3  girls that  have a  crush on  him, it's   annoying.",9

(this guy is relatable to the next level lol)
Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen is basically a story about two students who have a ridiculous amount of ego and also have a wild/wide imagination. The story revolves around these two characters who have high status in the school(where most of the scene happens) fighting with each other to reveal the other person likes for them. 
Personally,I enjoyed it.Some people who really likes story-based anime may not find this amusing but to me I like high school romantic
                  comedy anyways so I fine with this one.
The comedy part in this anime is very amusing,tbh I really enjoyed it. It wasnt trying hard to be funny its just the natural way to find things funny.
SS2 is coming YEAH",9
"
                Kaguya-Sama is a fairly average rom-com, albeit with an interesting concept and very well played out characters. The main cast featured in the Student Council play well with each other, creating some quite enjoyable moments.
Spoilers Below:
What annoys me then, is the typical ""nothingness"" of this anime. Throughout the entire thing, character development is hinted at, with the two main characters slowly falling for each other and sharing some genuinely sweet and heart-warming moments that aren't just played off immediately for laughs afterwards.
By the end, this has escalated to the point of ""Alright so they're gonna get together now, I mean there's no way they can't
                  at this point"", and then you are abruptly reminded that this is a anime rom-com, when 11 episodes of character development is tossed out the fucking window for the most blue ball ending I have witnessed this season.
In the end it is all for nothing, and you are left just thinking ""you have got to be fucking kidding me"".
While the comedy is good, it quickly becomes a romance anime and then at the end decides to back pedal completely anyway. This completely ruined a large part of the enjoyment for me.
Spoilers End
That being said, the characters are still very good, and I enjoyed the anime (almost) in its entirety, so I cannot say it was a bad experience.
A good anime to be sure, but sadly refuses to break out of the mould of its genre and actually become something memorable.",7
"
                This is a perfect romance-comedy anime.
With no visual nudity, lewd jokes makes a new kind of ecchi (not ecchi)- is what I liked the most about this anime.
The story leads to a obvious direction without any progress at every end of the episodes. It's kind of satisfying to watch.
It's full of small comedy scenes, can make someone's mood better. Whiles I was watching I kept on laughing and laughing.
The characters are made very nicely- perfectly. Each have different and funny personality which always makes the audience wonder what this character is going to do now?
I loved it, looking forward to watch the 2nd season too.
                  But I think I'd want them to be together in 2nd season.",10

Exceptional voice acting , one of the funniest narrators i've heard in anime. You'd probably be smilin or laughing most of the Episodes unless you're a Rock,[not the rock, he has a good smile].Story is simple and kawaii.Art is kinda cool , not the best out there but really cool . Sound is on point , including the voice acting i mentioned , just straight up awesome. Characters were detailed and really relatable to the audience. Enjoyment = 1/0 [Yeah it was that good.]. This anime just knocked all of
                  the criteria out of the park. One of the best anime's to end the last decade.",10
"
                I wasn't expecting much as usual from that new anime. 
I am old and have watched a lot of ""romance"" animes in my lifetime. 
This is where I was wrong, I love being wrong here. 
""Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen"" is one of favourite ongoing animes of the moment, I await frantically every week its release. 
It's just hilarious what can I say. 
The story is not that original and the setting even less, nevertheless the characters and the quirkiness of these characters make the show what it is: a great, funny as hell piece of art. 
I can remember being a teen
                  and the hardships of ""confessing"" and that crazy dream of being confessed to. What a thrill. In Kaguya-sama was Kokurasetai, it's taken to a fight level. I completely get the crazy, completely over the top battle between these 2 socially awkward, inexperienced teens. This ""I'll make the other do it first"" emphasising the themes of pride and the ability to scheme and manipulate indefinitely just really resonated with me. 
I love both main characters but also their sidekicks a lot, because every episode features a sort of misunderstanding and ends up being completely unrealistic, I end up laughing to almost tears. 
I just love it, I'm completely biased maybe but I can't fault that anime and can't wait for more.
I would just put a 10 as overall, I'm that into it but I also can recognise it is flawed too. It's predictable at times, it can be slow and annoying at others but still I'm that kind of fan that embraces the whole thing with the flaws when I have a crush on something!",9
"
                I have seen this anime at least two times before writing this review, and I can say that it is absolutely great in many ways. The anime is made to laugh, so, for instance,  the story isn´t that complex and elaborated, and in this case, its not necessary, the characters have very unique personalities, backgrounds, and reasons to act the way they do, the art and sound is great to accompany every situation, and thanks to that, it makes you feel like you´re there with the characters, sharing their moments and laughing with them, as if they were longtime friends.
Along with that, thanks to
                  every laugh, I believe that Shuchiin Academy Student Council members are good companions through tough moments when your mood is low and you are trying to feel better. This is why I think this anime is one you can comeback to anytime and will still be a good choice to watch.",9
"
                This series has a unique animation style. Animators surely have made a good work to show their special vision of manga. The whole plot is hilarious, it's a good rom-com. The OST is also adorable, especially OPs and EDs. All the characters have interesting personalities and it's a pleasure to watch them behave facing all these peculiar situations. Imao it's the greatest series of the last few years, and it's not an exaggeration. There was no such series that match all these advantages. Maybe some people won't get the humour of the anime, but this series is surely worth to try out. ",9
"
                The beginning of a new age. Many other romcoms fall into the trap of having one-sided interactions where one character teases another character, or one character is smarter than the other, but the story of Kaguya-sama doesn't flow that way at all. It goes both ways. The comedy is great and the side characters are strong: because of this it's easy to rewatch, and is a phenomenal gateway anime.
It will never get old. The characters and the situations they they encounter are extremely relatable, and the author is good at making you feel like you're friends with the main characters. You feel like you want
                  to root for them because they feel like they're real, they're afraid to fail, and they don't know if they're good enough to accomplish what they set out to do. 
The developments that the characters make over time make you say ""Yes! I've been waiting for this for so long!"" and they don't come instantly. The guy doesn't just get the girl after defeating bowser. The guy must first fail and struggle. The author is great at tying characters and scenes together to climax in a way that feels so right; and you can tell he spent a lot of time writing it. He gets paid to make these stories, and I'm writing this review to pay my respects to him.",10
"
                Ahh, no.
I watched all the episodes, i was either amused or annoyed and also am not sure if i really want a new season of this sh.. anime.
This whole thing is about overthinking the other human's feelings, if any of them makes a sign, or even just wants to make one, the other person will misunderstood it  and AGH I CAN'T TAKE IT, JUST CAN'T
So yeah, if you just want a comedy anime and are not curious about this whole feeling thing, here you go, have a good time watching it. But if you actually care about the story, and the characters relationship, then
                  wait for the second season.",7
"
                I love how they took  a problem everyone encounters and made it into a fantastic comedy! All characters had some development even the side characters. The jokes are good and the character designs and background are really good. I love the personalities of each character and how each blend with each other.  The outros for the most part are all unique. The story line is smooth and cohesive! I do wish they would have added a rival for one of the two. But over all I loved it and hope they come up with a season two of this anime!!
              ",9
"
                I went into this anime thinking it'd be similar to slice of life romances, boring and with barely any story. But this wasn't true and made this anime much better than what I was expecting.
I started this anime like 3 days ago because my friend asked me 'who is your favorite character?', and I hadn't seen this so I decided to binge it (failed to though). Out of the 4 main-ish characters, I would have to say Miyuki is my favorite and otherwise it'd be Chika just because of how funny she can be. 
While it'd be cool to see more story with the characters,
                  that's not this type of anime which I understand, so maybe Season 2 brings more to the table.
I'm glad to have finally watched this, and I will say this, I wish they made their 4 main characters a bit more full. They weren't completely shallow but there was more they could add to their characters in some bits.",6
"
                Kaguya-sama. This is just one of the weirdest animes i have watched. It's not that this is the only one i have watched fully....
SPOILERS ALERT! SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM FOR RECOMMENDATION!
This anime was watched Subbed.
Story: 6/10
The goal is very simple: Make other peson confess love. The first person to do it, loses! Why do you lose? Will something happen that im missing? I don't know! The point is, they are in a ""war"". This is the first thing you will see in this anime, which is great for telling the story, but after like 2/3 episodes, it gets repetitive.
You can see plot twists happening every
                  2/3 minutes or so, Chika comes and ruins/fixes some situations, but you know. That still doesn't mean that they drag it out!
I get it, the point of a war is to be a winner and not a loser, but what happens if you lose? You get rejected? Killed? Kiddnaped? I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY CAN'T YOU LOSE!
BUT, at least they get a huge plus for making stories about the characters in the anime! Some don't get one until the second season, but still pretty good for the first season.
The anime has occasional fourth wall breaks and even refrences to some real life stuff such as PUBG and Twitter, don't know why would you do that, but it's a cool thing nonetheless.
The last episode of the season, it's a cliffhanger. They see the fireworks on their summer vacation, bla bla bla and that's it. No one won. Maybe you will see it in the 2 season? Watch it! I'm not spoiling!
I also saw people complaining about the commentator and how repetitive is. I don't mind him, actually it's a very nice way to add something special about the episodes and talk about the story. YES, it's repetitive. YES you get bored of him, but at least it has that anime type vibe, where if there wasn't one, you would've just watched a IRL series/show but animated and in  a japanesse voice. Even better, if you watched it in english DUB without the commentator, THEN it would be a IRL series/show.
Art: 10/10
if we are being real, it's good. This was produced by A-1 Pictures, so i'm not shocked of the quality of the anime. Good job.
Sounds, Voices and OST: 8/10
Not a fan of this seasons OST. Although the opening is fine and catchy, im not really a fan of the ending. But of course this is my personal preference. Sound is sound, there was no problem here. Nothing was quiet nor loud, so that is a plus!
I don't have that thing were i hate a character based on the voice or if they killed a person (trust me, these people exist). It just matters that they are good at voice acting! 
Fan service: 9/10
I don't know what rating to give to this, but a strong 9 suits season 1. But ONLY 1.
Scenes where Kaguya feels embaressed that Chika has a bigger chest or anyone mentions about it(?), Kaguya not knowing what ""first time"" means(???) and other scenes like these are present in this anime. Thankfully it isn't repetitive. Sadly, more animation was put on those scenes then any other! (exaggeration).
I have to give credit to the animators for not having a mental breakdown when they saw the script say: ""zoom into Chikas chest. Make Kaguya embaressed."" 
(again, exaggeration)
Characters: 8/10
A good anime has to have good character development! This anime does it great, but not perfect.
As i mentioned before, for some characters, you may know their personality and their story by the first season, for some not! It's a shame since BOTH season 1 and 2 only have 12 episodes but it's great that they wrote the story for both seasons so you don't get BOMBARDED by information!
Enjoyment: 10/10
I watch a anime only if i get hooked by the first 2/3 episodes. It's good? It's good. It isn't? Ok, bye bye anime! This anime by the first episode got me hooked and i enjoyed every part of it! This is why i don't watch animes where you have 15 seasons, every season has 120 episodes, every episode lasts 1 hour and if you miss something in it, well TO BAD.
By making short seasons with short episodes, i will gladly enjoy the anime. It's a
10.
OVERALL: A 8!
It's a good anime. I don't like animes with 25+ episodes with 7 seasons, so this is perfect for me It has a good story behind it and it definetely isn't boring! However, some things and scenes are not needed for the progression of the anime and also explanations, as also how many seasons with 12 episodes are going to be made until we see who won.
If you don't have anything to do like me for a full day or need a anime recommendation, watch it! You can watch the whole season in a day! tran-
SITION, how did you like this first season, what are your thoughts about it? Do you agree with me or not? Make a review about it and i will see you later.",8
"
                I believe this anime was a great expose into the convoluted, yet silly ways in which people attempt to find love.
Now yes, I understand that it is exaggerated, but that is what makes it enjoyable! Their constant back and forth makes for a tale of two people who have never loved before, and are finding ways to make the other confess.
As a wise reviewer once said : ""if a tsundere and a tsundere liked each other, would they ever find out...?"". This basically sums up the entire show, as they both are constantly passive aggressive to each other, while still harboring strong feelings for each
                  other. The situations are exaggerated, but take a good look into what real life situations are like, in a kind of meta-analysis of the romance genre itself.
The only thing I would say fell short of my expectation are the ways in which they decided to go about tricking each other. They only ever think 1/2 steps ahead, and never take their own goals into account, and in the end they manage to lose themselves. This may be part of the point of the story, but this is what makes it falls short from being like some of the great shows that include such mind games (i.e Death Note). That and the sometimes filler-esque situations (i.g when Chika shows her accidental noodle prowess) are the reasons I gave it an 8 overall. Other than that, a real banger.",8
"
                Kaguya-sama is without a doubt an interesting take on romance anime. That statement might make any reader go ""Wow, never heard that before about any other slice of life/romance"", but let me explain why that single sentence is enough to describe this anime. Every now and then comes a romance story in anime that is usually declared (for the time it's still running) as ""amazing"", ""great"", ""the best"", ""innovative"", so on and so forth; and every time I usually check them out, they end up being decent, but never anything special.
You could argue that every romance anime is in itself special, or that they're all
                  plain and boring, and I would say to you that, at the least to me, they somehow succeed in being both. I'd say that being special is what, in itself, makes anything classified as such, ordinary. Without a doubt, Kaguya-sama has incorporated ideas, humor, character tropes and story arcs which are by no means one of a kind, yet it somehow gives its own flavour to those things.
Going into ACTUALLY talking about the anime, the start is definitely strong, however it can definitely be a hit or miss depending on the person. Some people like build-up, some like explosive starts to keep them engaged, and despite the fact I was not really a fan of its suddenness, I decided to keep going. The anime took the expression ""Love is War"" quite literally, and acted upon it. Its comedy is refreshing, and the understanding the writer has of the culture built by the current youth is definitely commendable. 
And yet it somehow becomes too much at times. For a majority of the anime there aren't any real ""conflicts"" which are usually customary in such a story. I'd go as far as to say they're introduced a bit too late, and furthermore, suddenly and without any (evident, at the least) foreshadowing of those events happening. In itself the story is enjoyable, but it could use some work regarding its pacing. 
Seeing as how this review is already running long, I'll try to go through everything else a bit more concisely. Its art is, I'd say somewhat stiff in terms of looks, and a bit off. It might just be my taste, but some fluidity in designs could definitely improve the issue, although, the dynamic directing definitely works in giving part of that fluidity and ""smoothness"" it needs, though it could use a little bit more. I have nothing to comment on the animation quality, as far as I can remember, there were no issues or low budget shots. The opening is memorable for sure, melodic and catchy, and the sound design complements the wacky nature of the editing, pacing and directing.
Our cast is incredibly eccentric and interesting to dissect, although that's kind of the whole nature of the show anyway, but some personality traits and the way they exhibit themselves should be improved, in some sense the characters seem dumbed down to appeal to a wider audience. I'd say its best quality is the enjoyment it provides. I found the humor to be broad, and (probably) amusing to a majority of watchers, its simplistic and dependent on multiple cast members, yet effective, but some parts are definitely a bit ""uncomfortable"", and they could be worked out. 
Overall, Kaguya-sama is a good story with many decent points, as well as many that should be improved, but nonetheless it remains enjoyable and friendly all throughout and leaves you wanting more. All that's left that I can say is, it's without a doubt an interesting take on romance anime.",8

                Timeless love story or timely social commentary?
In the real world, the one which spawned the surprisingly entertaining Kaguya-Sama: Love is War, teens are having less sex than, well, ever before. In this essay---I will theorize that the frustrating dynamic between Shirogane and Kaguya is a both a portrayal of and commentary on modern courtship. (Check this article out: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/the-sex-recession/573949/)
Kaguya-Sama offers at least one explanation for why kids aren't doing it any more (at least for those from the upper crust of society): hyper-competitive academic life. If you're the kind of kid who has to stress out as an about middle school applications, your social and
                  sexual development will pay the price. If you have a curriculum vitae at 13, you aren't going to have a normal social life.
Shirogane and Kaguya both represent the psychosexual manifestation of hyper-competition: Shirogane the insecure and confused, Kaguya the severely repressed. Shirogane's inability to act on his feelings is a result of his insecurity at being a late-bloomer, an internalized inferiority complex. Meanwhile, Kaguya is an interesting, if not unrealistic case: an atheist with a level of sexual repression resembling that of a Christian upbringing. These traits are laid out in the show---one thing that makes the anime extra enjoyable is the neat (and often explicit) adherence to Freudian psychology.
Now, the ""war"" between the two lead characters takes on an increasingly absurd level, but this is the only outcome that makes sense. Confessing for Shirogane puts his deep-set insecurity on the line, while confessing for Kaguya takes a level of sexual and emotional maturity that her insular life has prevented her from reaching.
The four main characters each represent an archetype of sexuality, forming a complete picture of the psychology of sexless teens: 
Shirogane: Impotence. 
        -Extreme fear of rejection and appearing ""creepy""
Kaguya: Repression.
        -Lack of exposure to sex due to focus on achievement + cultural upbringing
Ishigami: Inceldom.
        -Incels are angry and sad at their dearth of sex. However the portrayal of inceldom here is rather forgiving: instead of portraying the incel as entitled, resentful, and misogynist, Ishigami is seen as well-intentioned but socially unaware.
Fujiwara: Hypersexuality (?)
        -This one is a stretch, as Fujiwara is clearly the healthiest of the four.
        -However, her self-appointed role as ""love expert"" despite lack of experience in said field is a red flag. Her knowledge of that world is purely simulated, which is another interesting facet of the teenage sex decrease. Pornography is more easily accessible than ever, leading many to think that teens are overexposed to sex, as opposed to cut off from it. Fujiwara's relatively healthy orientation towards sex is thus a refutation to this: yes, it is possible to have a healthy understanding of sex in our world of free hentai and instant gratification.
Which one are you?",9
"
                Fun, typical story but told in very realistic way. The most beautiful part of this series is the way it presents situations which are pretty relatable if you have ever been in love for first time.
Side characters don't seem to be so. Every character seem to be main and don't just act as fillers or characters revolving around a lead characters.
For me, the most favourite characters were that of Hayasaka and Ishigami. I guess their chemistry would have been more entertaining if experimented with. Nevertheless, the whole series was like a refreshing experience filled with joy, giggles and lovely expressions.
Definitely recommended.
              ",8
"
                I consider the first season of ""Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen"" the best out of its (at the time of writing) three seasons. My resoning in short being that the theme/idea of the show/manga is best portrayed in the first season.
Of course, the main unique part of the show/manga was two highschoolers trying to get each other to confess first, because their own pride stops them from confessing. This is portrayed front and center, so much so that even the episodes start with an explanation of that idea.
The problems the two main characteres face are either relatable or amusing and the narration through
                  their thoughts and feelings makes the characters even more charming.
The story is good. Not anything super amazing, but still good. Some tropes in the story are somewhat predictable, and there isn't much never-before-seen plot points or anything like that.
As the original manga is very popular as it is, the anime seems to have a large budget, and it shows; the art is stunning, the soundtrack is amazing, the show is super enjoyable front to back, and I would recommend this show to anyone. 
--
tl:dr
""Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen"" is an amazing show for basically everyone, probably my favorite rom-com anime. Although I do not rate it as 10/10, there isn't a thing that I can really criticize in good faith. Please watch this show!

I originally dropped this anime about a year or 2 ago before I made a myanimelist profile , but then decided to give it another shot . Why ? Simply because of the fact ( at the time I ' m writing this ) the third season has the same rating as FMB , which technically means they ' re both rank #1 . 2 very different animes with the same rating . . I found that rather intriguing . . so I gave
                  this anime a chance to redeem itself ( for whatever it did that made me drop it ) && to help me understand why the third season has such a high rating . I have absolutely no regrets , I don ' t even understand why I dropped this in the first place . I ' m kind of picky when it comes to romcoms animes , however this has to be the best or one of the best romcom animes I  ' ve watched . . I find it rather refreshing to come across a romcom thats not completely cliché && boring . Personally , I ' m more of a fan of horror && action animes , but I do watch romance && comedy anime from time to time as a break from the usual genres I watch . Well , enough of that . . on with my review ! Do note all of this is just my personal opinion . . ~
♡ ∿ Story — 9/10
Although the story may not be about a fantasy world , or something of the like , which many would think is more interesting than a romcom , it was still an enjoyable experience . As a brief explanation of what the plot is , it ' s basically , Miyuki && Kaguya are in love however they refuse to confess their feelings to one another && so they manipulate eachother into confessing first . They use tactics that heavily rely on the other persons response , && the response both of them are trying to get out of eachother is a confession . The constant psychological battles of wits was enjoyable , all the different kind of mind games && tricks that they used against one another , && the effort that went into all of the attempts . . it was all very exciting to say the least . I will admit , at certain times this anime can be a bit cliché , however they use those situations && manage to escalate them to the point of hilarity . . basically they took common concepts && turned them into something unique , something that keeps the viewer watching .
♡ ∿ Art — 8/10
The art is simple , yet appealing to the eyes . . I can ' t imagine watching this anime with a different artstyle , it matches very well . . the expressions are well drawn aswell . I specifically like the style of the eyes , I can ' t quite say why . The first character I ever saw from this anime was Kaguya , which was basically my first impression of the art . I thought ( && still do ) the art was captivating && charming , especially the eyes , which was basically what made me watch it in the first place . All the covers are beautiful aswell ( look in the pictures section to see what I mean ) .
♡ ∿ Characters — 8/10
The character designs aren ' t anything too special , but they catch each characters personality perfectly && are memorable . I especially like Kaguyas , . a small detail I noticed in her design that happens on occasion is that her irises have a flame-like design , whilst everyone elses irises are normal . . I remember in one episode a flame turned into a heart I think ? . . I don ' t know what it could resemble , but I just found that interesting . Personality wise , everyone was interesting yet very different from one another . . basically , I found everyone likeable . . except Ishigami , hes kind of misogynistic , his dialogue was repetitive && the things he said in that * one * scene about Chika && Kaguya was just weird . . but other than that I did laugh at 1 or 2 things he said . Basically , my opinion is a bit more on the negative side . Chika ' s probably my second favorite , her "" love detective "" scenes were nice && she was just a really funny character in general , in a way I relate to her ! Miyuki is also pretty funny . . I love his relationship with Kaguya && I ' m excited to see more of it . Ai is very interesting && I wish we got to see more than just a few clips of her . .
♡ ∿ Enjoyment — 9/10
I absolutely loved this anime , it was unpredictable && funny . . it ' s refreshing to watch something different than usual && like it . The only thing I didn ' t like was the fanservice , but it wasn ' t bad enough for my score to be bumped down . . I kind of just ignored it .  There was a balance of comedy && drama that kept me watching , it never bored me , I wanted to see even more . . && well , I ' m looking forward to watching the next seasons aswell .
♡ ∿ Overall — 9/10
I recommend you watch this if you like romcoms , or if you want to try something different than usual . . it ' s only 12 episodes long aswell , so you can pretty much finish it in one day . Of course , I can ' t say this is for everyone , as there isnt any anime thats for absolutely everyone . . some will like it , some won ' t , but either way I recommend it , especially if you like romcoms , this anime is a gem .",9

                Oh love me mister! Oh mister!
I will be discussing 3 key points in this, the plot, the characters, and the music and sound design of the anime.
So let’s talk about the plot. This anime is about two students that are trying to make the other one confess their feelings in a way that uses deception, manipulation, and downright psychology to further their goal of becoming a couple. Now I know what you’re thinking, what a toxic relationship. Well as the title suggests, Love Is War. Love is a battlefield and to overcome it, you need underhanded tactics to win. And for these two individuals, losing
                  is not an option because their pride and dignity is on the line. This plot may sound shallow but all of that is just a façade because they just don’t want to be rejected by the person that they admire or rather love. Heck, do any of us want to be rejected? Of course not! The plot progression of this series will be worthwhile because the characters will be fleshed out and will have a major character development going forward.
So who are these characters? Well let me introduce you to the main casts of this series, which is the academy’s student council which is made up of the president, Miyuki Shirogane, the vice president, Kaguya Shinomiya, the secretary, Chika Fujiwara, and the treasurer, Yu Ishigami. 
Miyuki is the top student of the school and he has also placed second overall in the national mock exams. He is very studious and hardworking not just because he is academically on top but he also has a part-time job to support his family because his dad is unemployed and his mother left them when he was still a child.
Kaguya on the other hand is the daughter of one of the wealthiest families and was raised to excel in all her fields and that caused her to be socially detached and lonely. At the surface she may be cold and spiteful but deep inside she is just as naïve and innocent on the world around her.
Now let’s move on to the icebreaker of the show, the infamous Chika tto chika tto chika chika. She is the bubbly and light hearted secretary of the student council and is mostly used as comic relief and she is also the mother of Miyuki.
And lastly, the very observant, the lovable and the downright most relatable character, Yu Ishigami. He is straightforward and honest and doesn’t hesitate to help when someone is in need.
All of them play a significant role in the plot progression and even though they all have different personalities, they mix well together and create a dynamic, fun and interesting group.
Now let’s proceed to the music and sound design of the anime. The opening song sets the tone of the anime very well with its upbeat and James-Bondy feel to it in which the opening animation is the same of that of a Bond film. The anime itself is like a Bond movie where our lovebirds one up each other in their crazy strategies and tactics to win this war of love. And the sound design of this anime is superb, it makes you feel the emotion of the moment and it transitions elegantly to every scene. All I have is great praise towards this.
Overall, I enjoyed the heck of this anime and it made me want more and more. The only drawback I had with this is how after a major development towards their relationship, they restart to their old self, thinking if the other person likes them or not when clearly the events prior to it, they had a moment of adoration to one another. Well thank you for reading, and I hope you check this anime out.",8
"
                I think ""Kaguya-sama: Love is War"" is very good anime and an enjoyable one to watch. I think what makes this anime so fun to watch are the characters and the over-exaggerated elements in it.
The two main protagonists Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya Shinomiya are very well written, in my opinion. They are both highly intelligent and always on top of their game, but when they are dealing with love and relationship, they seem to lack the social skills which makes them looking like idiots. It's not a bad thing because in return it makes the show more entertaining and fun to watch. 
Another thing that
                  makes this show good is the narrator. The narrator being a third person omniscient is very helpful especially when learning about a character's thought process. Moreover, it build up tension to whatever the character's next step of his/her plan with the added exaggerated animations.
So overall, I give this anime a score of 9. It's fun to watch and the characters are well written.",9
"
                Seasonal anime, we love it and hate it sometimes. Yet we all can agree that there are and will be shows that bring something new to the industry and our understanding of a certain genre or anime in general.
As you may guess, ""Kaguya-sama: Love is War"" is one of such type. It takes a concept of a romantic comedy and flips it upside down, resulting in many bizzare situations that happen to characters throughout the series.
The anime revolves around two major characters: Miyuki Shirogami and Kaguya Shinomiya. From the very beginning we learn that they are mutually in love with each other, yet both are
                  two stubborn or graceful to admit it. Instead, they choose a path of rivalry, meaning that each of them tries to make the other one confess first. This results in a sort of paradox: Both Kaguya and Shirogane end up in confusing or embarassing situations because of their stubborness, instead of confessing and being happy together. This is what makes this show so fun to watch.
On the other side, we have Fujiwara and Ishinomi. Both of them affect the main duo in various ways, giving basis for even more jokes. Fujiwara is the ""force of nature"" that, due to her unpredictability, disturbs the plans of both parties. Ishinomi on the other hand is that ""link"" that connects the viewer to the other character(he's literally an otaku, who spends days reading manga and playing videogames alone).
Generally speaking, interactions between characters are what makes this show so funny and exciting, mostly because they are not cliche.
Talking about the visuals and the sound, I cannot say that ""Kaguya-sama"" looks good, considering that ""A-1"" has a somehwhat shakey reputation in this matter. Openings and endings are good(I'm honestly ready to put 10/10 just for Fujiwara dancing and singing in one of the endings).
In conclusion, ""Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai?: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen"" is a unique show, that presents us with a dilemma: ""what would happen if two tsundere characters fell in love?"" and turns it into a foundation  for many funny jokes.",9
"
                I have been looking for an anime that can really make me laugh and that I can really enjoy. And by far, this is the anime that I'm looking for. After watching Spy x family, I said I will never be able to watch an anime as good as spy x family. And I watched Jujutsu, it was good but there's still this sting coming from spy but then, after completely watching Kaguya-sama, it became a tie with spy x family that it surpassed it on my list. Now this anime, Kaguya-sama is my top one. I have never laughed this hard from an anime
                  before and I don't know if I can find another one as good as this (hopefully will). Anyways, it's a solid 10/10 for me. I love it in so many ways.",10
"
                Ouh Baby, sometimes you watch something and your like, ""yeah this is pretty good"" then you watch a little more than you like ""Okay, OKAY! this is pretty spot-on"" I mean maybe you don't talk to yourself but I do.
So we have two characters, both absolutely head over heels for each other, but they have to much pride to say it. one is poor the other is rich though it's only mentioned a few times and that's not even an issue, The episodes are split into basically 3 mini-episodes or challenges/Games, but don't fear a lack of character progression, even though it's basically mini-episodes they
                  still make progress on their stories.
Both our characters are really smart and part of the student council, as long as themselves there are two other members which also have very enjoyable personalities and are basically the opposite of each other, one is a super happy ""Yay!"" Girl and the other is a socially awkward wanna die but not really boy. There are actually a few things that this show suggests that we may or may not see such as romance support characters, Truck-chan, sub romance plots.
The art is really nice and fun to watch, even though the show is really light-hearted the art style would suggest that there may be some menacing vibes, though honestly, it's all just a rom-com good time and a little bit of ramen appreciation.
Please make sure to watch the end credits of episode 3 it's unique to that episode and is honestly very well animated, it even moves the credits to not block the action (Very appreciated). I really really enjoyed my time with the show, I watched in one day instead of 3 episodes here and there. honestly just good vibes some good jokes enjoyable characters and defiantly worth your time.",8
"
                This anime is straight up the funniest anime I've ever seen. Just barely beating out D-Frag as my previous favorite comedy anime as it is great, in every way. Starting with the story, although not a premise that is something special or new seen among the rom-com genre, it is a unique perspective that truly exemplifies what it should be. 
The art is great, I have no complaints. In fact, I feel that it is extremely good in some aspects, such as the scene where there is calculus involved to show an extremely (to us) easy problem to solve, but to the characters shows a
                  much more complicated problem. 
The sound is great. The individual who developed the soundtrack did a great job of making the tense situations feel as though they are stressful, and the relaxed moments feel entertain-able and vice versa. I have no complaints, as the music is great, but not quite on the level of our lord and savior Lord Hiroyuki Sawano. 
The characters are relatable, yet also funny as it shows what is possible if you are someone who tends to overthink situations (like myself), but still demonstrates elements that detail the situation in a way that you can understand and think is funny.  
Overall enjoyment is high even though I have not yet completed the series. It is extremely funny, and relatable as I'm sure many find. It takes Mikuyki, a virgin at 17 and a girl named Kaguya who are in love with each other but don't want to confess their feelings because it would seem weak. Even though at times this can seem ""tedious"" to deal with, it is still made entertaining in the same way that the chip scene from Death Note, although simplistic, is also entertaining and dramatic to a degree.
I recommend this anime to any individuals who enjoy comedy anime, romantic anime, or rom-com anime (of course) because of the funny, yet relatable elements that it contains.",9
"
                Reviews in 100 words or less:
In the beginning, everything will seem very unnecessarily exaggerated; don't worry, it gets turned down a notch as it goes on. It's only so over-the-top because that's exactly how these characters feel, it's definitely the middle school crush vibes two shy people have for each other. It's very relatable, when you're with your crush you start drastically overthinking everything, and this show captures those feelings perfectly. You laugh because you know exactly what they're going through. Feels outrageously slow at times, but it's realistically slow; you don't expect them to just confess love quickly. Also Chika dance is cool.

                If you're looking for a cute, lighthearted show, Kaguya-sama's your guy.
I haven't watched a full season of an anime in probably a year, I've been in an anime slump, I lose interest too fast, or the show I try to watch is too complicated, or simply just hard to get into (for someone that hasn't watched an anime in a while). 
But Kaguya-Sama was different, it captivated me, it was light and funny premise with an adorable high school setting. The show mainly comprises of the 4 main characters. 
   - Shirogane Miyuki; the school president
   - Shinomiya Kaguya; a company
                  heiress
   - Fujiwara Chika; the ditzy best friend of Kaguya
   - Ishigami Yuu; the relatable treasurer
(All of them work together as a sort of Student Council.)
Miyuki and Kaguya both have crushes on each other, but neither are willing to tell the other. And as the MAL description says ""The first to confess loses, will be looked down upon, and will be considered the lesser. With their honor and pride at stake, Miyuki and Kaguya are both equally determined to be the one to emerge victorious on the battlefield of love!"". 
Character wise, Chika really shines to me, and is great comic relief, the others are also good in their own ways, but Chika really steals the lime light a lot. I like that we don't see too too much of their personality, because it keeps the anime light.
The art in the overall animation, is nothing really new. However, once in a while there'll be some really funny animation and graphic, topped off with great music, which makes it all worth it. The show jokes around a lot, and in my opinion, is heavily elevated by the art and sound. But still, by themselves the jokes are pretty good, slightly hit or miss, but I'd say I laughed 9/10 times. If you've got a sliver of child remaining in you, it helps to know that there's a episode revolving heavily on penis jokes, which is pretty nice. 
I have to mention, as the show progresses it gets kind of easier to watch, in my opinion. At the beginning time doesn't flow as easily, I guess you could say. Everything revolves around Miyuki and Kaguya, and they never leave that one room. We don't get to see anything of their personal lives, of course this changes around mid way through, and gives a nice sense of their lives outside of school. And things from previous episodes get mentioned in the future, which is nice.
Did I love this? A little. I don't know if it's just the fact I haven't watched something in a while or what, but this show was really really lovely to watch. Especially the last 2 episodes, very emotional.

                Overall, this was a show kinda like No Game No Life in which there was a narration of how every battle between the boy and the girl was fought and who the winner and/or loser was. I thought it was fun and romantic to watch all the bantering, and to share the feelings of inexperience that I remember I once had. Granted most people wouldn't see love as a battle and would just share their emotions, but I understand that they felt  the need to one up each other all the time. This was a cute innocent anime, that wasn't that suggestive, but was
                  more funny and romantic than anything else. I would recommend it.
Music:
The music was rather enjoyable and I loved the outro with the girl dancing. They really put effort into that little scene! The voice acting was great, and I didn't see any problems overall with any of the music or sounds in the anime. 
Characters:
Ya know, it was a little tough to watch the characters grow, but at the same time it was nice and refreshing and I enjoyed seeing them learn from their mistakes and experiences. It was really a shame that neither of them are willing to confess their love, as it truly has so much potential, but we will never get to see that grow to fruition, eh? I found the maid to be rather cute and she did her best to not overstep her boundaries as a maid. It was so sad to watch the father practically ignore his daughter, but sometimes money makes people forget how truly important family is.
Story:
The arch of the story was well thought out, and I loved how there were one to two battles in every episode. It was brilliant and fun to watch how every battle was fought and how there were winners, losers, and even ties. I thought it was great how the other students came to the student council members for help, and then they go to others. And then how the president sleeps over and does nothing, he is a gentleman.",8

Two high school prodigy students in an over dramatic battle to make the other confess their love is not very realistic, but this anime does not aim to stay within the confines of how normal people would act. The over complication of a very simple and common situation that many young people face is relatable, and that is the main appeal of the show. Everyone has found themselves in a situation where they complicate interactions with someone of the opposite sex.
Love is War had no major shortcomings. The soundtrack was mediocre and there was little character development outside of
                  the two main characters (I did not see this as a problem), but these do not ruin the story (they add much to the story either). The artwork is amazing and is defiantly a strong point for this anime. Overall, the most of the enjoyment comes from how relatable the show is (and its wiener jokes). This is a very lighthearted series, so if you are looking for something more serious, look elsewhere. But I think the most people will be able to relate and enjoy watching Love is War.",8

                I'll write a short review on what I thought about this.
This is kind of a deviation to what I usually watch, but I still enjoyed it. I definitely want to keep watching the other 2 seasons. I don't think I've ever watched a romance anime before, but this acted as a great introduction.
Story 7/10, really good but nothing spectacular

Made an agreement with my bro to watch this if he watches Odd Taxi, which I've been trying to get him to watch for ages. But I'm actually glad I watched this too because I haven't had anything to watch for ages either. It has just been waiting for new seasons.

                [review 1]
Let's begin by noting a general synopsis of this anime -- ""Kaguya-sama: Love is War"" does not adhere to romantic realism, nor does it wish for its viewers to adhere to such realism.  In fact, it takes advantage of its ridiculous nature, whether it be the premise of the show or the actions of the characters.  Through this, ""Kaguya-sama"" is not a run-of-the-mill rom-com, simply because it does not take itself seriously.  Is this detrimental to the series?  No; it actually strengthens both the show's characters, enjoyment, story, and overall feeling. 
My personal rating scale has three main categories: 
                  Characters, plot, and enjoyability.  Conventionally, if broken down, these categories would include characters' series development, sub-plot details that don't force the viewer to include any additional effort to grasp but still flow in a coherent manner, and whether these two categories affect the enjoyability of the show due to the annoying nature of loopholes and character structures (or lack thereof).  ""Kaguya-sama"" has no doubt forced me to plan to radically overhaul my rating scale.  A lack of character development is oddly crucial in this show -- again, this rotates entirely around the premise that ""Kaguya-sama"" does not take itself literally.  
We see the story through the lens of comedic innocence -- the characters are humorously undereducated and childish despite holding rank in a prestigious school, the story is narrated through the mindset of one of these characters by an adult, and the plot itself is inherently stupid.  Yes, ""stupid"" -- but does a plot being stupid directly correlate with being inherently bad?  Conventionally, yes.  However, ""Kaguya-sama"" has a strength that I haven't seen in other romantic-comedy anime -- by refusing to take itself literally (not even once from what I've seen) and rejecting any sort of meaningful plot development, it not only distinguishes itself as a unique take on the romantic-comedy genre, but is perhaps one of the most loyal to that genre's description:  Romance and comedy.  
An issue with romantic-comedy anime is its flawed nature of taking itself too seriously at times.  We see this in ""Toradora!,"" ""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"" and ""Golden Time.""  Each one of these shows has, to a degree, a major ridiculous premise that contributes to the comedic aspect of the show.  ""Toradora!"" has an elf-sized schoolgirl living in a massive tower as a juxtaposition to its second main character, a tall and pressuring individual that lives in a small hut.  ""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" has its inherently ridiculous aspect in its title.  The whole plot-driver of ""Golden Time"" is amnesia.  These are not inherently bad qualities of these romantic-comedy anime, and are actually contributors to its enjoyability.  However, when the plot betrays its own ridiculous yet crucial plot points by attempting to be serious to drive plot, then the show arguably collapses on its romantic-COMEDY aspect.  The most blatant offender to this dilemma?  High-school and college students cannot control the world around them -- if you wish to meet reality, then play into reality.  If you wish to have a ridiculous premise, then play into the ridiculous premise.
We return to ""Kaguya-sama,"" a show that not only remains steadfast to its romanticism and comedic values, but plays into the ridiculous nature that it presents at the beginning of its series as the first and core motivator of plot.  It refuses to betray that aspect of light-hearted and innocent story-telling by attempting a serious nature in the plot. 
I will admit that all of this is abhorrently subjective.  All the qualities I mentioned that I consider detrimental could be just as supplemental in another person's perspective.  Through their lens, ""Kaguya-sama"" refuses to take itself seriously and thus, does not motivate plot development nor character development, resulting in a lackluster story with no motivation other than the ridiculous nature of world-power school students that seem to nearly control the world around them.  However, one could also see ""Kaguya-sama"" as an anime that embraces its ridiculous nature by refusing to drive plot points, using its detriments as a core strength to its storyline.  Lack of character and plot development not only contribute to its enjoyability, but its essential for the premise of which it lays upon.  For the nine episodes I've seen, the show refuses to take itself literally, and rightfully so.
But this is a glorified comic-book anime, at best.  
However, it is an over-hyped rom-com that has defied my expectations ten-fold and has destroyed my perspective of what I believed to be the guidelines to an enjoyable anime.  On my rating scale, I define a 10/10 as a masterpiece anime, one that changes the idea of anime itself and will undoubtedly remain a classic in the eyes of all who watch it.
""Kaguya-sama"" did change the idea of my rating scale; perhaps it deserves a ten from me because of this alone.  It is an amazing show that has a wonderful amount of enjoyment, a great opening, wonderful character interactions, and most of all, does not take itself seriously.  
I wouldn't feel right giving a comic-book anime a 10/10 though. 
8/10.
TL;DR -- ""Kaguya-sama"" is a light-hearted and lovable rom-com with hilarious characters that refuses to take itself seriously, oddly contributing to the enjoyment of the show.  The lack of plot and character development are crucial in this aspect, and result in an anime that stays loyal to both the romantic and comedic qualities that such a genre of this type should remain steadfast to.  By playing into its ridiculous nature, it holds onto its romanticism while also embracing its humorous aspects all at the same time, refusing to betray either part.

                I watch the anime first, and let's just say it's the reason why I started the manga.
This story felt like those chinese novels fighting with words but everything going wrong ngl. XD
The S1 Anime as itself is top tier. Comedy executed well in both OG and ENG Dub. The blossoming love is as heart-infuriating and heart-throbbing as it should be. Pacing is very great, execution is great too.
The only thing I could complain is that the lack of more episodes as it was too lacking to fill my thirst that I had to read the manga. ^^
Overall, really great. I may not like what happened
                  after this season 1, but the standalone anime s1 as it is is kewl and greatly recommended.",10
"
                In a genre oversaturated with shallow and tired tropes, Kaguya Sama Love is War manages to stand out amongst other romance anime, setting a new standard for excellent writing. The show has a plot loop that one would expect to become stale rather quickly. The two main characters (Shirogane and Shinomiya) are in love, but neither wants to be the one to confess first. Shinomiya is the student council vice president and Shirogane is the president. With such a simple premise, you would be justified in your skepticism towards this anime's enjoyability. However, it's the show's characters that make it such a joy to watch.
                  The side characters especially help in offering variety to the story. Usually, it's the side characters that destroy whatever plans the main characters have concocted. The chaotic nature of characters like the adorable Chika Fujiwara and the social outcast Yu Ishigami drive the immaculate schemes of Shirogane and Shinomiya into a tailspin, to hilarious effect. As far as overall quality is concerned, this show is better than it has any right to be. The animation is fluid and well-drawn, the music (like the fantastic OP) is delightful, the writing is fantastic, and the voice acting couldn't be better. Overall, I highly recommend Kaguya Sama Love is War as a shining example of a romance/comedy anime done right.",10
"
                Kaguya-Sama: Love is War is absolutely fun to watch.
Kaguya-Sama: Love is War is a drama comedy, adapted from a manga. The story revolves around cliche characters, however, the story is amazing! This comedy/psychological series is a great work, the humour is great and it was enjoyable to watch. The way the author interprets drama and the humour is fabulous and ties together well! I was surprised at how the production team made the effort of tying together mediums of art and sound. Of course the simple story made it more easy to enjoy. The story all is escalated on dramatic sarcasm and ridiculous growth in
                  the characters.
I definitely recommend watching this series if you really enjoy a good romantic comedy.",10
"
                Let's get the (I think) obvious out of the way. I find Kaguya-sama really fucking funny. Its comedy is diverse, creative and fresh, and it incredibly manages to not drop the ball in any of the 30+ chapters adapted. However, there is one important asterisk that prevented me from being all on board with the show.
--------------------------RANTING ABOUT EPISODE 1--------------------------------
I despise the obnoxious concept with which the show was sold to me and that permeated one of the worst first episodes I have seen in a long time. I really think episode 1 is nothing more than a narrator yelling and characters reacting to uninsteresting and
                  uncleverly thought out situations and plans. The ""battle of geniuses"" premise and how it was presented in episode 1 made me drop the series for almost six months before giving it another shot. That is why I was somewhat disappointed when in episode 9, having thoroughly enjoyed the show, Kaguya reverted to it and prioritized the ""plan"", leaving her loved one alone stuck at school with no means of coming back home. That made no sense.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Kaguya-sama is, for most the most part, is the cutest and funniest romantic comedy I've seen in a long time. The characters, led by the four members of the student council, Shirogane and Kaguya, the love duo, as well as Chika and Ishigami, have great synergy (I know I'm mixing up given names and family names, but that's how most people refer to the characters I think). Special praise goes to Kaguya's seiyuu Aoi Koga for the no less than legendary performance. The show also does a good job exploring the main characters growing romantic feelings for each other. And as they can't show their affection in public, Kaguya's and Shirogane's relationship ended up being a welcome change to the standard stuff we see in romances (with all the blushing, etc).
I'm willing to say this series is probably THE most effortless watch out there in anime. It's constantly fun, flows very well and uses different scenarios and characters to never get stale. The cast is endearing and Kaguya is cute in every situation imaginable.
As I was getting closer to completing Kaguya-sama I was gifted with the very rare feeling of intimacy with Kaguya and her friends. That was when I knew it did more things right than I had realized up to that point. I'm glad I didn't give up on it.",8
"
                I like the story because it's not boring. From scene to scene it is unique and given lots of funny faces. Moreover, the background design and coloring are really perfect. The opening and closing music is also good, it's good to listen to many times Each character is really suitable for the story, even though sometimes I'm bored because all that appears but it's not a good story. Overall I really enjoy watching it, especially when there are sound effects when the scene is really funny and I don't watch it. I guarantee you won't be bored watching it, especially if you eat something like
                  that, it doesn't feel like 1 episode is really long, even though it's only 20 minutes.",10
"
                Kaguya-sama: Love is War is an example of popcorn anime. A show where the fun factor topples everything else so, for all it's flaws, you still sit down to watch.
Plot / Story = 3/10
Our two mains are each others highschool crushes but are too proud to admit it. Each is waiting for the other to make the first move. Would have worked if the writing was better, it frames the most mundane and normal thing as an act of pure genius. Works for a one time gag but when I mean everything I really do mean EVERY. LITTLE. THING. FOR. 12. EPISODES! It gets old
                  fast and starts looking like filler. 
Characters = 4/10
Our mains are rather passive. The enter story happens around them because they refuse to take an active role in it. There is a reason Chika, a side character, is the breakout of this show. She is the only pro-active character in it.
Miyuki (Male MC) does have a few break out moments but that's only because Kaguya (Female MC) is as empty as could be. So it's a comparison, a normal decent guy if a bit shy Vs the born yesterday + rich girl troupe.
Chika is a meme so her personality shifts and changes depending on what the plot or gag requires at that specific moment. Because she's bubbly though she remains likable but that's some bad writing.
Another issue with the show here is the narrator as he is a character as well. He starts off as fun and a bit sassy but it dips into annoying a bit to often. Like that one guy in the theater that talks over the movie because he thinks the world is interested in his commentary way more than they are the movie itself. 
Art + Sound = 5/10 middle of the road with no standouts
Fun Factor = 7.5 / 10
They're cheap laughs. You have half an episode that is just a Weiner joke. Another that is Chika eating ramen while someone marvels at her choices. 
Thing is, a cheap laugh is still a laugh. And because it's all silliness you can just sit back and enjoy. Writing isn't the best so the characters seem inconsistent as they are in service of the jokes not the other way around.
Overall = 6/10
It's an ok show for a lazy weekend but that's about it.",6
"
                This is an anime where things fit. They are appropriate for the setting and the formula that the authors intended to create. The art is just standard for a modern show, but it fits. The music is nothing to write home about, in the sense that I didn't notice anything particularly outstanding about it, but I haven't been annoyed by it either. You know, it's there, and it's kind of good... it fits. The humor... well, humor is largely a matter of personal taste. It didn't make me fall off my chair, but I did laugh. It was funny for the most part.
Not EVERYTHING fits
                  though. Sometimes the authors were too strict to the formula. For instance, you'll quickly notice that the show is somewhat episodic. Each episode is divided into smaller scenarios, at the end of which a narrator declares a winner or a  loser. And it was a nice touch on the whole, but a few times it felt like just an unnecessary gimmick, only included to follow a pattern. I also can see how people may write off the show as dull or average, because what you'll see here are by and large the same old tired tropes and hackneyed Japanese devices used to convey character emotions: exaggerated expressions; loud and odd behavior. 
However, the flaws that I can point out are largely nitpicking, and things I only see in retrospect when I step aside and try to analyze the show objectively. While actually watching it, I was completely immersed and entertained. Time went fast, and by the end of the last episode, I was sad it was over and wanted more. In fact, this is one of the best anime I've ever watched (I haven't watched many, so take that with a grain of salt). There's no much unprecedented here in many departments, but it certainly is innovative in the way that it handles its story. You won't find many shows like this one. Whether you'll like it or not you can only find out by watching two or three episodes, which I highly recommend to everyone.",8
"
                Spoiler free review
The rom-com genre is filled with copy-pasted shows that 99% of the time aren't funny.
Kaguya-sama: Love is War manages to be funny with its ultra fast paced comedy and great animation. That's enough to make a good show.
Story & Characters 5/10
Most of the time, a show like this doesn't need much depth in the story to be good. There's not much story going on in here, just basic plots that carry the episodes. Couple moments had some hints at deeper story aspects, but those kinda didn't go anywhere. The characters themselves weren't *that* interesting either in their own right, but in the overall
                  show they work well.
Art 9/10
You could probably say that the animation is too good for a stupid romcom like this and it kinda is. Part of the show's comedy from the fact that all the jokes feature some over the top animation with amazing quality.
Sound 7/10
OP is silly and too catchy. The background music works with the jokes and does it thing. Few of the background tracks were a bit overused, but that's a minor thing. Nothing mindblowing, but just good.
Enjoyment 8/10
The most important thing: laughs were had. As said before, the comedy involves fast paced jokes and top notch animation and combining that with being well directed, the show manages to be really fun to watch.
But at times it feels like the show is trying too hard to be fast and that makes it feel a bit too hectic. The narrator is kinda overused too, many scenes probably would've worked better if the characters would've done the talking themselves. Still, the good aspects of the show really outshine the bad ones.",8
"
                A very solid romantic comedy that slides more towards the comedy side of things.  Its characters are like machines, their ridiculous personalities bouncing off one another in reliably entertaining fashion.  As the show progresses more characters are introduced to lead to more complicated jokes and along the way the characters are grounded enough for you to grow in your affection for them.
The presentation is solid and as the show goes on its use of creative visuals increases to punch up the jokes.  It's not the funniest thing in the world but it's a provides a solid amount of enjoyment and is elevated
                  by an excellent and highly creative dub.
This season unfortunately builds up to a potential ending before pulling a bait and switch.  This was insulting at the time but the two sequel seasons have provided a satisfying ending and i would consider the show to now be a worthwhile use of time.",7
"
                The anime gave justice to the comedic mind-game romance manga! Each music that the animators chose were perfect, making the comedic scenes EVEN FUNNIER THAN EVER! ♥ The voice actors especially the ""Narrator"" were superb! I definitely admire the meta humor, romance combined with straight facts in this anime. It was perfectly executed. It makes you really curious on how people think and what they ""actually do in real life"". This is my happy pill! In short, this is a masterpiece anime and it's worth re-watching..and reading the manga! :-) ♥
PLUS the opening song (Love Dramatic) is a bop!! Also the ending song (Sentimental Crisis)
                  gives you all the feels = Just the sweet perfect combination! :)",10
"
                Love is war. The title made me think ""what kind of story will be presented in this anime?""and I'm very happy that this anime has elements of romance comedy. The essence of the story in this anime is. Shirogane and Kaguya are respected people at their school. They actually have a crush on each other. But they don't want to express their love for each other because of self-esteem issues. They do various ways so that one of them can express their feelings first. This strongly reflects the word ""love is war""
The way they are able to express their love for each other is an
                  element of comedy in this anime. Comedies like that in my opinion are very fresh because there is no comedy like this other than in Kaguya Sama Love is War. The story in this anime is not always about romance and comedy. There is a drama part in this anime that makes me want to cry when I see it. Whether it's crying because it's happy or crying because it's sad. Comedy stories mixed with drama make my emotions go up and down like a roller coaster
Also the opening song in this anime it's a banger. 10/10 for the opening song",10
"
                Overall really funny and enjoyable to watch. Chika best girl of course but Kaguya is also good. Its fun to see Shirogane and Kaguya try and out smart each other and use psychological warfare mixed in with a rom-com.
However, here are the 2 reasons I give it a 9/10 and not a 10/10 .
1. The narration/narrator can get annoying at times and makes the viewer feel like they are to dumb to understand what the characters are actually thinking and what is going on. In this situation ""show don't tell"" is the superior approach. The narration takes away from the humor and I think it
                  would be a lot better if the characters just had more internal monologue which would replace the narrator and make the show more personal I feel.
2. The constant win/lose announcement breaks between different skits/scenes. I don't like the whole concept of splitting up the episode into different sections so blatantly like the show does in the titles of the episodes. It makes the show feel like it has less overall meaning and doesn't mesh well. Most of the time the ""winner"" of the specific scene, whether it be Shirogane or Kaguya is extremely obvious, and again, makes the viewer feel dumb by spoon-feeding them every piece of basic information. There doesn't have to be a ""winner"" to every single scene, it just feels forced. The show would flow a lot better and feel more congruent if the whole winner/loser screen was just cut out completely.
I know I talked a lot about the bad stuff since I had to justify not being able to give it a 10/10 but all in all, its still a great show and really fun to watch. I just can't quite muster up that 1 extra point for the show because of the annoying narrator and slightly fragmented feeling episodes due to the winner/loser screens. Both of which make the viewer feel dumb and like they need to be specifically told every detail. It's more fun when viewers have to read between the lines, discover their own findings, and come to their own conclusions.",9
"
                ah, kaguya-sama: love is war. i've seen & heard many things about this anime. its practically the staple of romance anime, after all! however personally, i've never had any interest in watching it for myself. that was until the newest 3rd season overtook fullmetal alchemist: brotherhood as the highest rated anime on this site. i mean, could you blame me for being incredibly curious? especially with psychological being my favorite genre, i decided, hey, why not? i might as well give it a shot. & oh boy do i have no regrets about it.
story ; 9/10
i felt a little wrong rating the story this high,
                  since its not incredibly deep or interesting or an in-depth fantasy world. however, i realized that it doesnt have to be in order for the story to be enjoyable. the plot is, basically, miyuki & kaguya are in love, but both of them refuse to confess their feelings to one another, so they manipulate the other into confessing first. let me get this out of the way, i absolutely loved the psychology aspects of this anime. it was fun seeing the different tricks & mind games that the characters used against the others. were some parts pretty cliche? yeah, but that didnt stop me from loving it any less. in fact, i kind of loved it more in that aspect. was it cringy at times? oh definitely. but i loved it anyway. i think it may be the fact that i just needed a break. thats the best way i can describe this anime. its a break from the things that are troubling you. sometimes you just need to watch something cliche, cringy, but overall cute, to keep you going.
art ; 8/10
there's not much to say here. i enjoyed the art a lot. i mean, its simple, its cute. its not breathtaking or really unique at all, but its appealing & nice to look at. thats all you really need.
sound ; 7/10
i didnt pay attention to the sound much, but it wasnt distracting or out of place during the anime. the opening & ending songs were catchy. 
character ; 9/10
i liked the character designs of all of the main 4. i found the characters to be very likable. i had a little problem with ishigami being kind of misogynistic at times, & especially That One scene where he completely deserved being beat up by chika. but i still liked him anyway. kaguya & miyuki are a cute & endearing couple with their silly mind games. chika is silly & i kind of wish we had more of her ""love detective"" scenes. hayasaka, while being a pretty minor character, was interesting & i wish we had gotten to see more of her. the characters weren't deep or fully fleshed out, but i don't think they need to be. they were enjoyable, while a little basic.
enjoyment ; 9/10
i loved this anime a lot. it made me laugh, like a comedy should. it was just sweet. i didn't enjoy the fanservice scenes, though, but i never do in any anime (i like men). however, the fanservice scenes didn't show up so much that it bumped my enjoyment score down too much.
overall ; 9/10
i must say, this anime won't be for everyone if you dont enjoy cliche & cringy romcom anime. however, as someone who does, i loved this anime. i can't wait to watch the other 2 seasons!",9
"
                Okay, it's my first time reviewing a slice of life anime. I wanted to watch one, so I can kinda calm down my likings of shounen combat anime (tho, I love some of them, like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, but we'll get to it later, cause I'm waiting for volume 6, and the other volumes). So, at first, when I was gonna watch it, I somehow thought this anime was gonna be some sort of a love murder and stuff. And when I found out about it, well what can I say, I love it. My first time loving a slice of life anime like this.
                  One of my favorite, tbh. I'm gonna do my best to try to look deeply into why I love this anime. Btw, there's gonna be a little spoilers here, so, you've been warned
Story
Well, to be honest, there's not much story in here, and that's perfectly fine, cause some anime, or other type of story, can have their own focus. To sum it all up in one sentence, it's basically Death Note, but it's a comedy romance. Basically this whole show is about the two people that come up with some sort of a battle to prove whether they have a crush on each other or not, because none of them wants to admit that they do have a crush on each other. This anime is so fricking crazy and I love it. I basically love everything about it. It made me laugh, it made me root for the characters, and it's so entertaining! :D I can safely say that this series is focused on the characters and I like that. Overall, it's a 10/10 hehe
Art
Tbh, I had that first thought before watching it, cause if the art XD. The art is pretty good, tbh. I like that when it wants to be crazy or exaggerated, they go into that mood and I love it. I also love the art when it's showing us the characters' real thoughts. Tho, tbh, the outro of episode 3. that is the Chika dance, is so flawless. I don't know how they did that, but it's super good. I like art of the anime. Overall, it's a 9.7/10
Soundtrack
I really like the opening, cause it's so catchy and it kinda made me wanna dance XD. I also like when things go out of control or exaggerated, the music goes for it and I love it, tbh. And the outro of episode 3 is so good, and catchy, that makes me wanna dance with Chika, hehe. Overall, it's a 9/10. The opening is pretty catchy
Characters
I can relate to Miyuki, when it comes to try winning a girl's approval. Cause, of course, when he is about to do something that he feels that it's stupid for Kaguya, he kinda overthinks of what she's gonna say about it. I like him, tbh. I may not be the best student like him, but I can relate to him, in a personal way. Tbh, I've never met a girl like Kaguya in real life, but I like her, tho. Any other high school girl might relate to her, when it comes to trying to win a boy's approval. I can safely say that they're static characters, and I really like that. They're so quirky and they're fun to watch. I like when we get to see how they feel about what they're gonna do that they think that it leads to their internal victory. Overall, the battles that they have for each episode is so satisfying to watch. Tho, I was so entertained watching the part where Kaguya tries so hard not to laugh in front of Chika and Miyuki. Oh, speaking of Chika, I really like her. Her personality is so quirky that it keeps you watching, like with Kaguya and Miyuki. I like how she stops Miyuki and Kaguya from arguing, and that, unconsciously saves Miyuki and Kaguya, in order for one of them to have their own internal victory (I say unconsciously, because she doesn't know that she saved one of them in order for them to gain their internal victory).  Ishigami is also a fun character. He's pretty funny, tbh. The funny part is where he thinks Kaguya is a psychotic maniac that kills, just by looking through her eyes, that actually made me laugh out loud. And I like how he gives Miyuki his advice on how to apologize to Kaguya (even tho, Miyuki lies to him that it happened to a friend, and Ishigami knew it was about between him and Kaguya). They're super entertaining to watch. They're all 10/10
Enjoyment
I honestly laughed out loud, rooted for the characters, and got super entertained watching this anime, tho. It is super fun to watch! I wanna re watch it all over again. At least it's better than watching the Death Note netflix movie hehe. I recommend this to all of you reading this review!
Overall
It's a 10/10. It's my first time that I love a slice of life anime. I wonder what other slice of life anime I can enjoy watching",10
"
                This review and the score are based on both currently aired seasons of Kaguya-sama (the third one announced but currently not aired as of writing this review)
Love is war! The person who falls in love loses!
The premise of this anime. I actually had this one on my list for sometime and heard from a friend that it would be a good one to give a try. So one day I said to myself heck why not I'm in a mood for something light and funny. Oh boy I'm so glad that I didn't put this one on the shelf for later.
The story:
As far as the
                  story goes its actually quite basic and I honeslty think that it fits the setting quite well.  We have the basic she knows him for some time and they develop feeling for each other. The twist here is that neither wants to make the first move instead they scheme to make the other one confess first. Throw some highschool  club activities and friendship development  and we have the whole story of Kaguya-sama. But fret not! That basic premise is really fitting and allows us to focus on other aspects.
The art:
The art is really great! I swear that the work that went into character eyes must have took a third of the budget. Both characters and environments are vivid and colorful. Very solid work here
The sound:
Great. Simply masterful  opening from  Masauki Suzuki. Love dramatic fits great and has so much funk and ""Oh Mister"" it's still stuck in my head days after watching (and a new member of my commute to work playlist). Daddy daddy do from the second seazon didn't hook me as much as the first one but still a very solid and funky tune. 
The characters:
This is where the gold is IMHO. The characters and their interactions are the main source of gags and entertainment. As far as our main cast goes we have: Kaguya Shinomiya, Miyuki Shirogane, Chika Fujiwara and Yuu Ishigami. Shinomiya and Shirogane complement each other personalities very well. Their plans and tricks get the story going forward whereas Ishigami and Fujiwara serve as catalysts for comedy. But that does not by any means mean the characters are shallow on the contrary we get to see quite a bit of growth. 
Kaguya Shinomiya our heroine. From the start we get a feeling that she would be a typical rich ojou-sama. Having a high class upbringing and somewhat sheltered education regarding some subjects (which is also a gag source) gives a cold and diginified aura. But as the story progress and we get to know her better she shows that deep inside she is still  cute, fragile and not that far off from your typicall highschool schoolgirl. 
Miyuki Shirogane school council president. Hard working, intelligent and caring guy. He goes out of his way to help others in need.  Juggling not only being the school council president but also the top of the school in terms of studying and working partime. Sleep deprived and shy having a knack to fall into seemingly awkward situations along side Kaguya. Miuyki is a person that gives his all in everything he does and doesn't stop at nothing to help his friends. 
Chika Fujiwara our happy-go-lucky girl. No care in the world always cheerful and full of energy. Mama Chika has the uncanny ability to show up in seemigly normal situations that our heroes have trouble with( like sharing phone numbers or social media IDs or having a taste of another person's lunch) and offers a simple (and according to Kaguya shameless) solution. Besides that airheaded attitude Chika can be very reliable, such as being able to teach Miyuki volleyball serves even though it takes quite a toll on her.
Yuu Ishigami on the surface typicall nerdy otaku character. Gives only the minimum required effort in his studies and concentrates on gaming. Seen as an outcast and unreliable person by other students. He frequently goes into funny outbreaks regading various topics such as love. At first scared of Kaguya but as time goes they warm up to each other. Yuu is a more complicated character and its a shame we get to see so much development form him so late in the series (the second half of season2).
Enjoyment:
I really have to say that I was surprised that this was soo much enjoyable. From the get go I was welcomed with an upbeat, funky intro and treated with the premise that Love is war and you have to be a skillful tactician to win another heart. Everything clicks well here. The story being basic helps us focus on the characters things revolving around them. Very light anime doesnt tire you out like some others. I thought I would just watch an episode or two a day but ended up binge watching both seasons. It just had that certain ""je ne sais quoi"" that ends up catching you without noticing and you just have to put on that one last episode before going to bed (yeah right).
Summary:
Overall a great light story with captivating characters, funky soundtrack and great colorful visuals. If you are fed up with heavy, hard to watch anime with unnecessarily complicated story this is a great one to put on. One that I will recommend without guilty conscience.",8
"
                I was very impressed with this. The main premise of the show really intrigued me and I had been hearing about the second season a bit, so I had some expectations going into the show, but they were easily exceeded. The art style in this show is super energetic and really engaging, transforming otherwise tedious exposition and dialogue into staple moments of the show. I love all the different ways the show expresses Miyuki and Kaguya's inner thoughts as they battle each other for the upper hand. This energetic aura in the animation is maintained throughout the show, which was relieving to see in a
                  way since I was worried the show would peter out as it reached the final episodes. The pacing of the show is also really well done. About halfway through I started to expect to get bored since I thought the show would repeat the routine of the first couple of episodes, but again I was pleasantly surprised. The situations in which the characters found themselves were flipped on their head to keep the viewers on their toes and story continued to use the character in engaging ways. I was also not expecting the show to be as funny as it is. Chika and Ishigami are probably the funniest characters in the show and the way in which Miyuki and Kaguya reacted to the predicaments they both found themselves in were funny as well. The character interactions are definitely one of the best parts of the show. Also, the OP absolutely slaps. Overall, super fun. I can't wait to start season 2.",8
"
                I think it's great! I enjoyed all of it and it's genuinely very funny. I loved it so much that I ordered the manga so I could read the rest of it! I can't wait for season 3!
One thing I love about this series is that the romance part actually progresses! It's not that the characters are completely oblivious to the others or that it's one-sided either. You see two people genuinely fall for the other and you are rooting for them both! 
Another thing I like is that it is quite realistic. Ishigami has depth, Kaguya has depth, Shirogane has depth etc. it makes
                  you feel a deeper connection to the characters and root for them even more. There is tragedies, there is heartbreak, there is comedy gold, there is disappointments, there is hope and there are victories. 
This is very well-written and I enjoyed it! I can see this going down as a classic if finished right for sure!",10
"
                To express your own feelings is a question that bears no clear answer and is often subject of comedy and drama in japanese animation. How does Love is War fare among the many romcoms in the anime industry then?
Storywise it's definitively a step above most other animes even if not by much . Story is nothing unique, the path to love of the MCs follows the usual school->summer->festival pattern with slight variations also permitted by the student council context. Biggest fault is the lack of tangible progress in the plot which is really plain and predictable. Still it manages to deliver without being boring or
                  predictable thanks to comedy and fast paced arcs.
In terms of art and sound we are presented with a well animated anime always accompanied by a well executed and meaningful OST. Being a 12 episode only season A-1 had the time and the resources to put costant effort in each episode making it a pleasent experience for the eyes, plus the episode 3 ending conquered a special place in my heart. Opening and ending are also works that deserve recognition; the dub is not only on point but it's also the main gear that makes the comedy function properly.
The weakest point is by far the character, absolutely forgettable in my opinion, there's very little development in the first season and it's mostly about Kaguya, the other characters see very little variation and introspection from their starting clichè postion in episode one. It's made worse by the very little cast which makes things repetitive.
Overall this is an anime with the main objective to make you laugh while putting some element of romance to make the whole experience more varied and enjoyable. Comedy usually hits the spot and romance is deep enough not to fall into cringe, which is otherwise a common fault. Being able to overcome such comedy obstacles that cause the other animes of the genre to lag behind make Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen a solid 7,5/10 despite plot and characters problems holding it from going for excellence.",8

                I'm really not sure what to think about this one. I'm not that hard of a critic, nor i'm not some specialist like some people seems to think about themselves when i try to read their reviews... but well... let's say i know my anime.
I'm not even used to writing any reviews, but lately i thought it could be a good idea to put sometimes thought into a full sentences.
So yea - Kaguya-sama. Never watched anything becuase it was popular, even in case of my first anime - death note, soon after it was released but only because my friend asked me to watch it.
                  Same thing in case of Kaguya-sama.
After watching many amazing shows we were bleesed with (and i won't name them not to angry people who thing otherwise), and many.... not so good (here as well) i'm kind of easy to satisfy (or i should say ""harder to disappoint"") and at the same time harder to find something unique in the title.
We can't say Kaguya-sama was a something super original. We can't say it had great story, character progression or anything... but after years i made especially one important rule for myself, if you check my, work-in-progress right now, animelist, you could easly see i'm really forgiving if it's about giving scores (could probably change some right now though), but #1 rule i have to give 10 is, if i simply enjoyed the title... i'm not going to play critique here, if i enojyed the anime, if even with smaller mistakes, worse drawings in some parts, in the end i enjoyed it, had fun, maybe cried, laught hard, it was a good time without some really annoying parts for what i could take some points from that 10... i don't really see a reason not to give it. Especially if you find even not that great, original of an anime, but it's a kind that before even realized, few hours have passed...i think it did it's job, don't you think?
I'm not talking about works of people like Makoto Shinkai because especially they should be really appreciated. But to be honest every owner of that ""10"" on the end should be.
But i really can't give Kaguya-sama a 10... Didn't think about it until actually 12th episode and one great scene i'm in love. It's tru because of work i had like 2-3 months of break from watching anime with breaks for new episode of Boku no Hero and Isekai Quartet and it might affected it but without spoiling it, one particular scene made me love the anime, and main characters more than Fujiwara or Hayasaka (By the way, someone hold her please :( ). At that point i realized, even if we agreed that anime has pretty much 0 story or any character developent at all, i really enjoyed the title, time with it passed for me preety fast and with some tears in my eyes (yeaaaa... i kind of succer for good anime romances.. :P) i waiting for one of them to say something....
and after sudden (like 1-2min) kick, all magic disappeared like if parents told me again that Santa doesnt exist... whole mirrage of their developemnt, mirrage of good ending i love so much, was exchanged for same scene we saw through whole anime with them not being able to be honest with each other - something that, like always, with some new gag, was pretty enjoyable (not like in case of some overrated anime.. *ekhm*Himouto! Umaru-chan*ekhm*... sorry i had to :( ). But that last time, it didn't work for me. It didn't work because after all of that, the anime showed me chance for lovely and beautiful ending and then it reseted itself to first episode with few minutes. Every emotions that were built in that one scene, were destroyed and we were leaved with that feeling to realize soon that we have to wait for next season to MAYBE see something different, something happening.
To sum it up, i really enojed this anime, the ""last"" scene made me really love it (like really, for a moment i felt like watching something on level of Koe no Katachi, it was simply made really well) and until that point i could easly give it a good old 10 without complaing about that missing... many thing. But even if i do realize it's going to be a second season, and i'll probably watch it some time, after that last few minutes i just can't give it that 10, and i'm actually not sure if i'm really waiting for continuation...
After thinking for a while, for now i'm giving it 8, but i'll leave it for a day and i might change it.
Thanks for reading and hope you share at least some of my thoughts!
Have a nice day (or night ;) )",8
"
                Love is War is one of my favorite rom-coms that is unique unlike other rom-coms and executes itself perfectly.
The story is much to my liking, with these 2 bound to be lovers fighting against each other to see which one confesses first. I love the academy, due to how each character interacts in the academy and it gives off a home-pleasant feeling. 
The artstyle is basic in my opinion, due it being generic, it's not bad at all, but it's an art style I see in any other rom-com.
The animation is beautiful, with A-1 pictures giving this show what it deserves, fluid animations, funny animated
                  expression, A-1 pictures does it all.
The sound is what gives this show flavor. With the opening and ending being very enjoyable to hear and Chika's song being a nice touch to this series. Also having a great set of voice actors really tops the cake as well.
Characters. I LOVE the characters, each and every one of the cast are so expressive and unique. Especially the main character, Miyuki Shirogane, who I really like due to him not being a wuss and generic. 
Overall, I enjoy and adore Love is War, I believe it is one of the best rom-coms of all time and I stand by it. Obviously the show has some flaws and weird moments, but no show is perfect. 
9/10 show, would recommend.",9

                Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai - (Anime temporada 1-2)
his review was translated by google translator so some things may have been translated literally
n an oversaturated genre with shallow and tired troops, Kaguya Sama Love is War manages to stand out among other romance animes, setting a new standard for excellent writing. The show has a plot that is expected to quickly become obsolete. The two main characters (Shirogane and Shinomiya) are in love, but neither of them wants to be the first to confess. Shinomiya is the vice president of the student council and Shirogane is the president. With such a simple premise, you would be justified
                  in your skepticism about the fun of this anime. However, it's the characters in the show that make it a joy to watch.
em portugues 
 um gênero supersaturado com tropas superficiais e cansadas, Kaguya Sama Love is War consegue se destacar entre outros animes de romance, estabelecendo um novo padrão para excelente escrita. O show tem um enredo que se espera que se torne obsoleto rapidamente. Os dois personagens principais (Shirogane e Shinomiya) estão apaixonados, mas nenhum deles quer ser o primeiro a se confessar. Shinomiya é o vice-presidente do conselho estudantil e Shirogane é o presidente. Com uma premissa tão simples, você estaria justificado em seu ceticismo em relação à diversão deste anime. No entanto, são os personagens do show que tornam a alegria de assistir",10
"
                Don't know how I'm just getting around to this one either (I feel like I always say this), I've known the gist of Love is War (or whatever this long title translates to in english) since like the pre-covid days and I already thought I'd like it. And I do it's good.
I'm not really gonna explain the show's gimmick I assume we all know it already, but it is really really entertaining. Kaguya-Sama: Love is War (I googled it) is pretty funny, and anime tends to have absolutely no understanding of comedy, so this is a pretty high accolade coming from Remi Dial the comedy
                  maestro. Not gonna lie I still don't think you're gonna be busting out a hearty laugh or anything, but it got me a couple times. 
Pretty much all the voice actors are in their bag here, which I think is really crucial to get jokes to land, but the narrator especially is just outdoing himself. He has an important role in explaining all the battle strategies/general tomfoolery, so I'm glad he nailed it. I think this is the best narrator I've seen since Space Dandy. (I watched in sub, so I'm really speaking on the Japanese actors; but really if u still watchin in dub imma heartily laugh at you nigga)
All of the characters are really good here, but I think Fujiwara is especially worth noting, I always think it's a gamble having an intentionally air-headed character because they can be really annoying, but she really adds alot to the anime's comedy as the wrench thrown into Kaguya's schemes, and she's actually a likeable character. 
(I'm not really sure whether or not to refer to characters by their first or last names, the title refers to Kaguya by her first name, but throughout the show everyone is addressed by their last name, which is really unfortunate as both Kaguya and Miyukis' start with a Shi- which was confusing at first. It makes sense for a formal school setting I think this is how the Japanese language works but figured I'd just mention it anyway.)
I really want to throw Love is War a 9, but I don't think it's quite there yet. I think the ""Shirogame visits sick Kaguya"" arc was kinda stupid, which sucks because it ended up spanning 2 episodes and was supposed to be like a climactic point when it didn't really have the legs to stand on. The romance also doesn't really progress very much, which doesn't matter to me because I view the show more as a comedy about romance rather than like a straight romance, but I could see it annoying some people. Just know this is a high 8 like an 8.7-8.8 to me and better than 90% of the 8's on my list.
I know I'm almost 4 years late and 2 seasons behind at this point, but I have my money on Kaguya she is leagues smarter than this nigga Shirogame, did you see how she played him with the umbrella?!?!? They had to nerf her with Fujiwara and she's STILL playing this man a solid 85% of the time. (Even though realistically it'll probably end up with a tie and they both confess their love at the same time or something gay like that.) Sal this is probably right up your alley but don't watch it until I'm caught up with season 3 because you'll watch the entire thing before me and I'll irritate me.
Theme song review is an 8/10, this one is really good and different than alot of the guitar heavy theme songs other of anime use. After the title screen when it hits that ""badoom bwurr ba da da!"" I am ABSOLUTELY BUSSIN DOWN in my bed just a filthy groove. Then the smooth singing from the guy with the female backing is just *mwah*. The horns from whatever instrument are dope if I knew more about music I'd really get to analyzing and all that but I don't. I've kinda been too lenient on the theme song reviews I'm gonna try and be a bit more critical some of these songs really just ain't up to par.",8
"
                This is my favorite high school rom com slice of life. I know these are a dime a dozen but this is an example of an anime being executed so well that it distinguishes itself. 
The general premise sounds pretty generic: you have a high school student council and there are two top students who are tsunderes for eachother. The story is nothing special as it is this type of genre, but it does progress naturally and works perfectly fine. 
This anime just does so many things right. The main two characters are dynamic. They have their own personalities but they grow over time. The
                  supporting cast are also super strong (a little static, but not completely) and add tons of enjoyment to the show. The narrator kind of gives that over the top Jojo freeze-frame feel except its hilarious because its for completely ordinary situations.
How everyone interacts with their strengths, flaws, and humor just really makes this a genuinely funny and enjoyable anime. I highly suggest people watch this.",10
"
                This is the possibly the funniest anime I have ever seen. I am not joking. I find this as funny as Konosuba, if not funnier. The story is simple enough. Two tsunderes are in love, and are trying to make the other confess their feelings. But as I always say, it's the execution that matters most. That means that you could have the most basic idea for a plot ever imagined, but depending on what you do with this idea, it could be the greatest show ever written. Of course I'm not saying this is the greatest show ever written, but I am amazed at
                  how each episode feels so unqiue from the last even with such a simple idea for a comedy, that somehow I have never seen anything like before.
The animation is nice and clean. I mean it is A-1 so what did you expect. It's not going to be bad is it? Nothing special though, but to be honest it doesn't need to be.
The music is good. Again, nothing special though. Not much else to say.
The characters are the best thing about this show. I love them so much. Without going into spoilers, the main two are Kaguya and Miyuki, and they are so well developed for the kind of show that it is. They are well written characters with some depth and their personalities appear quite layered at times. They are so fun to watch on screen, and so are the side characters, like Chika. I mean Chika is basically God. I watch the Chika dance ending sometimes ten times a day. I am not joking. The character interactions are so good too. It is so funny seeing these completely different personalities interact together in the most ridiculous circumstances.
Overall, what a hilarious show. The funniest thing I have seen in ages. The humour is easily a 9/10 on its own. I give the show altogether, a 9/10, for being so funny and having such memorable and distinct characters compared to other comedies.
Thank you for reading my review of 'Kaguya-sama: Love is War'.",9
"
                every season there is always the one anime that get hyped. and this is one of those. tbh i'm actually hooked this series because of the memes of certain clip, that makes me curious why this anime is so popular? is it that good? is it that funny?
man, how regret i am to finished this storyless and boring romance comedy.
the first episode is the time to actually set the premises and other things like that. actually its good how there is some kind of ""mind war"" between two highschooler who loves each other (idk why they have those feelings, since THEY never really build up
                  anything to that point, they just give the cooked meal for us to agree and enjoy. and for me thats one of the minus of this anime, like you'll never get hooked, sympathize and care for they relationship if they just give that with no reasoning at all, and yeah if later they told us but for me no, how can you care for something until they give you reason in the next next next season?). 
idk i didnt like the format of subs episode, jumping to another short story with no plot progression at all. they just doing REPETITIVE format and setting of jokes and short story that so predictable and so makes us the audience feel bored and didnt laugh anymore. i love the comedy i love the romance or drama but sadly this anime is overhyped to the death. 
two reason i completed this because i hope this get much better in later eps but sadly no, yes there are no CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT at all. they are just the same. and two the OPENING is so badass. i had to replay that song over and over again by watching another eps and make me unconsciously completed this mediocre anime.",4
"
                I've thoroughly enjoyed this series. The characters aren't stiff or cliche. They're dynamic, interesting, and hilarious. The comedy lands every time and, even when it's not trying to be funny, it can still produce a little laughter, always for the right reasons. The narration attributes to the story in a way that isn't monotonous, unnecessary, or irritating. This anime is so brilliantly written in the aspect of its comedic timing, development of characters and relationships, and the entertaining mind games played between Shinomiya and Shirogane. Chika could be construed as the token ""stupid, big-boobed extra,"" but she's only one of those things. She may not
                  have the high intelligence that Shinomiya and Shirogane possess, but she's definitely not a dope. She was able to emotionally manipulate Shinomiya during the word game in order to win. She adds to the story in a positive and entertaining way instead of the usual annoying side character that adds no true value to the story or main characters and is purely to fill the obligatory ""best friend"" role.
Overall, this anime is incredibly entertaining with golden comedy, well-developed and interesting characters, and a story that leaves you wishing the episodes were longer than thirty minutes. This is truly the most refreshing romance anime I've seen in a while.",9
"
                Okay okay okay, so Kaguya-sama right? I went into this show without a lot of expectations. I'd seen how popular it was when it first aired and just thought that it was another crappy straight person anime filled with straight romance for straight people. Those tend to get pretty boring pretty quick anyway, even to other hetero folks, but to a gay person??? Yawn. But I knew that the openings for the two seasons that are out were bangers, so my girlfriends and I decided to give it a try.
Quickly - more than I ever could have anticipated - Love is War has become one
                  of our favorite series hands down. No questions asked. We immediately fell in love with the characters who are all so incredibly stupid and endearing in their own ways. The cast is stellar in their ability to convey these characters; and what great, well-written characters they are. 
The pacing is great and it's hardly ever boring sitting through and watching. Each gag and joke lands and is so incredibly funny. This is truly such a good romcom that doesn't take itself seriously at all; except, when it does, it makes you want to cry. It's a fun, lighthearted, ridiculous story about two idiots trying to force the other to confess first with some actual backstory and a hint of seriousness that gives the characters and the show the drive it needs. I can't recommend this series enough.",9
"
                The story is about 2 high schoolers who don't know how to confess to eachother. They both they hard to get the other to confess first and not gonna lie, season 1 is slow, but its like an intro to know the characters. Season 2 is where things get fun. I personally like the narrator because he basically recaps a little and gets to the point. There may be childish jokes, but it makes it better knowing that Kaguya has never had a childhood and was always this serious person. 
The art is great! I've seen better, but nothing is wrong with it. 
The sound
                  is great! The va's are a great fit for the characters. The op to both seasons is great and upbeat! I love it!
The characters are all polar opposites which is why they make a perfect team! Ishigami becomes more open in season 2, but in season 1 he can be seen as emo and whatnot, but he's refreshing to see. Chika is so cute and an airhead haha. She is very helpful towards Kaguya and Miyuki tho. Kaguya can be childish despite being a genus on tactics towards Miyuki. Miyuki is so relateable (there's an ep on how he finally got sleep and became a different person and it's hilarious). He has a great sense of leadership and season 2 gets even better. Season 2 starts getting more romantic and it's still as funny as ever.
I enjoyed it and jam to the op every time. Some scenes can seem like fillers, but its a lighthearted anime and i recommend it!",9

How to profess your love? Is the reward worth the risk? Most viewers will be able to relate to the struggle faced by the anime’s protagonists. Nobody wants to be rejected, for so much is at stake. Buckle up…
If you enjoy rom-coms and have an appetite for constant Death Note-like mind games, where you can see into the minds of our conflicted, angsty protagonists as they try to outwit each other (countering a counter... and so forth), then this anime could potentially leave you in stitches. And if you don't mind an almost complete disregard for ""show, don't tell"", where an omniscient narrator (who is mostly funny) comments on almost everything that is going on, then you are even more likely to enjoy this anime. And if you don't mind negligible character development and growth, clichéd characters (a tsundere, bakadere, kuudere, paranoid otaku...) and that there’s no plot resolution, then you, dear viewer, are highly likely to enjoy this show (but that’s quite a lot to ignore).
The teenage protagonists, both who are full of pride, are hesitant to make the first move, fearing that this might be seen as a sign of weakness, a sign that is tantamount to groveling and begging: ""Even though you should be lucky to have me, please accept me, Great One"" sort of thing, which has to be avoided at all cost. Rejection, of course, is the dominant fear faced by the pair. Instead of being direct about their intentions, the pair constantly try to manipulate events in an attempt to corner the other, in an attempt to engineer favourable situations. In almost every episode, we have these over-the-top mind games, where even a simple issue is blown out of proportion. These mind games are hilarious and refreshing initially, but such overuse gets tiring.
Despite the few drawbacks, you’ll be pleased to know that this anime managed to make me laugh several times (and this is a tremendous feat), but there was one episode that was so awful (had lame wiener jokes) that if affected the overall quality of the anime (I deducted a full point). 
However, this anime’s cinematography is really something else, and it is what hides any immediate flaws. All camera tricks that you can think of (panning, zooming...) are used effectively to engage viewers, to add to the drama, to magnify emotions. Many scenes are shot just within the same room, but the cinematography is varied enough to keep things dynamic and exciting.  The colours might not be vibrant enough, and details are sometimes lacking, but the editing and transitions are stellar.  
The opening complements this anime, but it is not exceptional; and the ending (apart from the special ending of episode 3, which features an adorable solo dance performance that is reminiscent of K-pop choreography) is forgettable. 
Unfortunately, too much ""tell"" weakens viewer engagement. Most of the information is dropped into your lap. I have to admit that the omniscient narrator is funny (and his comedic timing is brilliant at times), but having such a narrator (a double-edged sword with potentially more drawbacks) diminishes tension. You will either hate or love him. 
Should this anime have almost the same rating as Death Note, which actually has truly intelligent and sophisticated characters? No! Death Note’s concept was really novel, and the mind games were on a different level. If it were not for the fact that Death Note lost steam after a certain event, the gap between Death Note and this anime would be even wider, and we wouldn’t even be debating why this anime should be considered in the same bracket. 
Is this anime as good as or better than OPM? No! But you said that OPM is also repetitive! Yes… OPM is repetitive, b-but… it is a gag anime (a satire) that has a lot going for it (and you do wonder each time whether Saitama will eventually meet a worthy opponent, whether he will be accepted by everyone). This anime, however, fails to convince you why the characters are in love with each other. Saitama’s conflict and motivation, on the other hand, are very clear (and you want him to face a challenge). 
Is this anime as funny as Gintama (the GOAT within comedy)? Hell no! Such sacrilege. Whenever mind games do happen in Gintama (for example, in the dentist episode), you can expect to laugh even more (and the situations are more varied and comical). Gintama has sooo many likeable characters, and there is great action as well. Other than the editing, it’s just superior to this anime in almost every way.
Is this anime funny? Yes! It is definitely above average (anyone who scores this below 5 is probably taking the piss, because the execution is definitely above average). I laughed a lot. But this anime has quite a few problems. If you can ignore these problems, you’ll have so much fun. Enjoy.",7
"
                Mediocre, fanservice-filled romantic-comedy animes have become something of a guilty pleasure for me as of late. I was fully expecting Love is War to be another one of those as I went into it, based on the memes and such that I had seen online prior to watching it. 
I ignored the fanbase, started watching the show, and thankfully; I was wrong.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Story: 7/10
Love is War, in basic terms, is about two borderline sociopaths who will stop at nothing to force one-another into confessing their love. They will manipulate each-other, and really everyone around them to achieve that goal (they really do sound like awful people
                  when I say that out-loud lol)
Being a slice of life-ish anime, there's not really much of a plot to speak of outside of that. Each episode is broken up into 2-3 mini stories (for lack of a better term) to make up for the lack of an overarching story. I've watched some shows that have tried to do this in the past, but Love is War is the first one that I've ever seen do it well. Each mini story helps develop the characters and their feelings toward one-another, while being hilarious at the same time. The pacing of these mini-stories is perfect, never overstaying their welcome, while also not feeling too short. The result is a 20 minute episode that feels like it was 10 minutes long (in a good way, of course). There are admittedly some mini-stories that are complete filler (ex. the ramen scene in episode 11), but even mini-stories like those are so funny that I find it hard to complain about them not progressing the story or characters at all. 
The concept of Love is War is incredibly unique for it's genre, and I give it a ton of points for that. While the situation (plot and romance wise) is more or less the same at the start of season 1 as it is at the end of it, the story is exceptionally well done for a rom-com, and develops the characters in a very satisfying fashion.
Characters: 9/10
There aren't a lot of characters in Love is War. Off the top of my head I can think of 5 or 6 that actually have any impact on the story. That's not a lot, but they compensate for that by making those characters extremely fun and likeable. The show starts out with 3 characters; the president, Miyuki; the assistant president, Kaguya; and the secretary, Chika. These 3 are the only characters in the show for the first 4 episodes or so, which I think was a great decision. The first few episodes are spent building up these 3 characters, showing how they think, what their goals are, and how they interact with each-other, before a introducing a few new faces a couple episodes later. The treasurer, Ishigami; Kaguya's maid, Hayasaka; and Miyuki's sister, Kei, are all introduced after we get to know the main cast of the show, and in their own ways, they disrupt the flow of how we're used to seeing the characters act. It's not exactly anything groundbreaking, but I think formatting it like this was brilliant. Instead of throwing a bunch of characters at you all at once, it allows you to take them in one at a time, and see what makes them tick.
Love is War does a great job of developing it's main characters, by pretty literally showing you what they think about any given situation. Watching the thought  processes and mental gymnastics of Kaguya and Miyuki as they try to defeat one another is hilarious every time, and has yet to get old.
In the first season, the only character who's backstory is told to us is Kaguya. Most of the time, if I feel like I don't know a whole lot about a character's life before the beginning of the story, I find it a little hard for them to resonate with me, but this show has become an exception to that. Despite not knowing all that much about their histories, characters like Ishigami and Miyuki are enjoyable every time that they're on the screen.
Watching the characters interact with one-another is easily the best part about Love is War, and I can't wait to see how they continue to build up those characters and their relationships in the next couple of seasons.
Sound: 8/10
I don't think the opening is that great to be honest, but MY GOD IT IS CATCHY. In the few days that have passed since I began watching this show, I've found myself humming or singing 'love is war, love is war, love is waaaaaaar' almost subconsciously at least 5 or 6 times. It will not get out of my head.
The voice-acting is good across the board, no complaints at all.
Art: 8/10
The animation in this show is solid, with some creative art direction to go along with it.
Miyuki and Kaguya are essentially rivals, and that is represented by their character designs being polar opposites (Kaguya has red eyes and black hair, while Miyuki has blue eyes and blonde hair, etc.). The 'battle scenes' between Kaguya and Miyuki take this to the next level, changing the background as a whole to better reflect their personalities (red vs. blue, etc.). These scenes were some of my favorites in the show, and in anime as a whole.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love is War is just about as good as a rom-com anime can get. I don't think I was bored for even a second while watching it, due to the nearly perfect pacing that this show offers. I fully understand the hype now.
It's funny (which is more than I can say about most rom-coms), it has a great cast of characters, it has a fun, unique concept, and some great art. There's not a whole lot more you can ask for. This is one of those romance animes that I would recommend to someone even if they aren't a fan of the genre. I think the appeal is a lot more broad than something like a Dress Up Darling or a Nagatoro (plus, it doesn't make you feel like a loser for enjoying it). 
There aren't a whole lot of things I disliked about this show, but I know that it can be improved upon, which is why I'm not giving it a higher score than I did. Nevertheless, this was a great first season, and it has built up a solid foundation for the next few seasons to stand on.
Thanks for reading.
Overall: 8/10",8
"
                That Kaguya-sama is ""cliché"" and unoriginal is the prevailing critique of the show. The romantic scenarios presented are overused tropes. The characters are introduced as simple caricatures; Kaguya as a snobby rich kid, Chika as a loveable airhead, etc. 
Yet, the show is actually incredibly inventive. The energetic narrator and over-the-top animation take the romantic clichés to the point of near parody. The expertise of the comedy is matched by compelling characters. After several episodes, the main cast gains surprising depth for such a shallow premise.
The heart of the show is the ""mind games"" between Student Council President Miyuki Shirogane and Vice President Kaguya Shinomiya
                  as they try to get their counterpart to confess their love. Their relationship is intensely relatable, not because we as an audience are as smart (or as dumb, on occasion) as Miyuki and Kaguya, but because at the crux of their desire to have the other confess is self-doubt that maybe their counterpart doesn't harbor feelings for them. That mustard seed of self-doubt is something that most anyone can relate to.
Like the plot, the OST plays romantic tropes up to the point of parody to create a loveable soundtrack. Animation studio A-1 pictures brings the heat with its incredible animation, so much so that viewers can almost forget that nearly the entire show takes place in one setting. Kaguya-sama's greatest strength is its ability to flip from laugh-out-loud comedy to heart-string-tugging drama on a dime. 
When all these factors work in tandem, the result is nothing short of a masterpiece.",10
"
                Love the characters. The humor is great. It's clever; a battle shonen but it's romance, with the battle being a battle of wits trying to get the other to confess. Of course it comes with its emotional and heavy hitting moments, a good story, and funny jokes/scenes.
Season 2 gets even better. 
I definitely recommend watching this, although I'm a teen, so adults are likely much less interested in this. 
Since I need a longer review, what actually got me into this was the Chika dance, funnily enough. First time I saw it I thought, ""what the heck is this, this is weird. But I do
                  like the voice."" After listening to it five more times, it grew on me, and eventually I decided I had to see the anime that it came from. That brought me here, and I'm glad it did, because this is an excellent anime.",10
"
                Disclaimer: This review is a review of the entire series, not just season 1. This includes the manga as well. I will not give any major spoilers though.
Where to start... This show has everything. I went in expecting a pretty standard rom-com, but oh boy was I surprised and delighted. This is the best anime I've ever watched (I've watched about 20-30 anime, not too much compared to some but I think it's enough to be credible in this review). 
Let's start with the comedy. The comedy is fantastic. I usually don't laugh out loud whenever I watch funny things. The most that I'll do
                  is just smile. But Kaguya-sama: Love is War, is different. I've laughed out loud several times while watching this show. Even when I'm not, I'm either smiling 'til my whole face hurts or nearly crying at the emotional parts. I'll get into that later. There is no dull moment. The pacing is wonderful, not too fast that you're not sure what's going on, but not too slow that you're falling asleep while you're watching it. The comedic timing is perfect too. The creators of this show know exactly what they're doing in terms of comedy.
Now we'll get onto the emotional parts. The emotional parts, while few, they steal the spotlight without any trouble. Despite being a comedy, the deeper, more emotional moments of the show are some of if not the best moments. They don't feel out of place either. MINOR SPOILERS For example, Kaguya wanting to see fireworks, while not explicitly stated until the part was shown, there are hints all over the place that her family is messed up. It sounds confusing since I went from fireworks to family, but once you watch the show you'll know what I mean. That entire episode was one of my favorites as well, and the comedy was actually kept to a minimum, proving the writers could not only pull off a flawless comedy, they could also pull off a tear-jerker without a sweat. 
The characters are all great. The entire main cast has a lot of depth, each with their own unique and quirky personality types. Kaguya is very stiff, very formal, etc, but when she's driven by emotion she turns into an idiot. Shirogane presents himself as a perfect student in front others, but in reality he too can be an idiot when it comes to love. Ishigami, well, you'll see. Iino is also like Shirogane, although a lot less flexible when it comes to rule breaking... unless someone compliments her or is nice to her. There's a lot more, so this is extremely simplified. Obviously the best way to find out how great the characters are is to just watch it.
I've seen someone say that the characters don't progress or develop. Oh boy, can you be more wrong. Just wait. You can't force characters to evolve in episode 1. It has to be gradual, otherwise it isn't natural. It feels very natural in this show. However, it doesn't happen until a lot later into the series, you'll have to read the manga for that. Even so, there are still minor character developments throughout the series. The most notable one isn't very minor, it's a pretty big one, that being Ishigami. The smaller ones would be Kaguya and Shirogane. If you compare them from the beginning of the series to where the anime is right now, you'll see they are actually quite different. 
Overally, this is seriously a 10/10 anime. There is not a single dull moment, the comedy, romance, characters, etc, are all executed perfectly. This is the #1 show I'd recommend to anyone, whether or not you like rom-coms. I guarantee you will enjoy it, unless you're a toxic fanboy that trashes on any other anime that isn't their favorite show, which probably applies to about half the people on MAL.",10
"
                    Based off the manga, Love is war is arguably the best romcom out there. Ranked 8.54 stars and 90th overall Love is War definitely deserves that spot or even higher. Love is War is about two narcissistic people who are geniuses and love each other. However, they don't want to be the one to confess to each other because they believe that being the one to confess makes you lower than the other and will end up in them absolutely dominating you. Because of this, both characters, Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya Shinomiya, do everything they can to get the other person
                  to confess using psychological warfare.
    First of all, lemme just start this off by saying how much I love the manga series, probably my favorite manga series of all time. Now what makes this romcom so good and better than the others? Well, to start things off lemme just say how every character in this anime is so lovable. They each have unique and amazing personalities that make you just enjoy every scene without thinking ""yuck it's this character again, he's so annoying."" Even the side characters are enjoyable and don't feel like completely scraps of garbage because they p much all contribute to the plot or comedy.
    Miyuki Shirogane is the student council president of the school and is the smartest student and was able to make it into a high noble school due to his charisma and abilities. This man has amazing reactions to whatever Kaguya pulls out and always surprises audience members with his quick witty thinking and his strengths and weaknesses. Miyuki is one of those rare male romcom protagonists that make you wholeheartedly love and support.
    Kaguya Shinomiya is the vice president of the student council and is the highest of the highest among nobles. She is the daughter of a company that influences the whole world immensely and herself is a tactical genius at strategizing methods to make Miyuki confess. She always has the most brilliant strategies that impresses everyone and with her contrasting personalities it creates this special character that we all want to know more about.
    Chika Fujiwara is literally best girl in the anime. According to a certain YTber they belive that Chika is actually the smartest among the student council despite being a complete airhead. She is able to read the mood and somehow always gets in the way of Kaguya's plans. Despite this, she just cannot be hated as a character. She is charming just so adorable. Trust me, if you watch this anime she will probably be your favorite character too.
    Last but not least on the student council is Ishigami who is this depressed emo kid who constantly fears kaguya. This man creates amazing comedy in the anime and just livens up the anime so much. In the manga he has, in my opinion, the best arc. Great man
    This anime will put you on the edge of your seat at times wondering who will succeed and how certain plans will end in. It's a heartwarming romcom that stands levels above others and from me is a 11/10. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to have a good laugh and journey.
    Opening and ending are fucking amazing. The opening has this 70s vibe to it yet feels modern at the same time. It is amazingly catchy and the visuals are hella interesting. The ending has this cute voice and symbolism of kaguya being an angel and flying in the sky with the student council and it's just cute ending to go through. The best ending is the Chika Fujiwara ending tho (check out episode 2 ending ;))",10
"
                Love is War is an interesting concept with only passable execution. The ""war"" involves Shinomiya and Shirogane, who are in love with each other, but are too shy and prideful to confess. Both believe that the first person to confess their love is weak and a loser (literally and figuratively). They therefore try to force the other to confess their love first. The story sounded entertaining when I heard of it, but it only ended up meeting half my expectations.
*Minor spoiler warning*
Story: 6
Love is War is supposed to be romantic comedy. Personally, I felt that the romance was there, but the comedy was only so-so.
                  Some of the stories just were not funny (the wiener segment, for example), and the punchlines and climax of the episodes' stories occasionally fell flat. That said, there were some genuinely funny parts (the final exams segments, for example). Another thing I didn't like was the serious parts of Love is War. I personally prefer comedies to be fully comedic, and not include dramatic plot elements. This is why I don't like comedy-dramas (for this reason, I refuse to watch Jojo Rabbit after my siblings told me it was both funny and tragic). Additionally, the inclusion of a serious storyline seemed unnecessary, as everything appeared the same afterwards. Nothing had changed.  Lastly, the serious storyline lacked background. A more extensive explanation for the motives of the characters for this part of the series would have been nice.
Art: 9
I felt that the art was fantastic. The lines were clear, and the characters looked nice. The opening credits had some good art. The designs for Shirogane, Ishigami, and Shinomiya were a bit underwhelming, but their personalities were pretty distinct, so it didn't really matter. However, they really didn't need to emphasize Chika's cleavage so much. Then again, what did I expect? This is anime!
Sound: 8
One thing I never understood about Love is War is how such an amazing opening song could have such an awful singer. The tune is truly great and the lyrics are fitting. It's one of the best opening songs I've ever heard, but the artist sounds like a creepy old guy. Give me Amalee's version any day. Speaking of creepy old guys, guess what the narrator sounded like?  I personally think watching the dubbed version is better, because not only does the narrator sound normal, he is also expressive, creative, and side splittingly funny. The ending song sounded like it was sung by an infant. The background music for the episodes, however, was good. It really helped create an atmosphere of war (a lover's war, in any case). 
Characters: 10
Love is War has some of the best characterizations in the whole of anime. Shinomiya, Shirogane, and Ishigami all have distinct personalities that are fun to see. Chika's personality was incredibly entertaining.
Enjoyment: 6
Overall, I would have given Love is War a higher rating if the humor were consistent and if the narrator wasn't so awful. Also if it didn't have the elements of a comedy-drama. Don't get me wrong, there were generally funny moments, and the animation and characterization were top notch. But the three aforementioned factors really lowered the overall enjoyment, which is why I think Love is War deserves a ""6.""",6
"
                I knew that this anime had a lot of success while it was airing, i didnt watch it at that time, one day i knew that this day will come and finally it came.
I thought that i'll get bored while watching it, i was wrong. Yes i had difficulties at the beginning to be into it but i was about to clear this quickly.
I'm not a big fan of the ending song but the opening one is clean
For the sotry, i think it's really interesting to see how two characters with the same personality (moreover with a cliché personality) can get along. By the way,
                  those characters are really adorable. Too bad that Chika and Yuu are also classic characters so i thought that the first one will make me angry, but she's ok too
I didn't think that a second season was necessary, but i'll watch it, and see if it's also a perfect one
This anime has to be seen by people who are fans of romantic stories and humor",10
"
                I feel like Kaguya-Sama (Love is War) is the prime example of an overhyped anime. While it's definitely an entertaining watch that's overall pretty good, I really don't think it's deserving of all of the hype. It definitely has its moments but the characters act infuriatingly, the story constantly repeats itself, and there is absolutely zero character growth. It's the equivalent of a show like Big Bang Theory, you can open any point of the season and still be fully capable of watching it because nothing ever happens, it's all just single-episode plot lines with no effect on the long term of the series.
Overall, 7/10.

                Story 9/10
Miyuki Shrogane and Kaguya Shinomiya are the President and Vice President of the Shuchin Academy student council both are immensely intelligent and looked up to by the student body both are also assumed to be popular with the opposite sex in matters of love this couldn’t be further from the proof as both are completely hopeless in the ways of love.
Despite not getting on at first they quickly fall in love with one another however neither is willing to confess this love and instead we get an incredibly amusing psychological battle as both Miyuki and Kaguya attempt to get the other to admit their
                  feelings believing that to confess ones love first is to lose the war.
Art 9/10
The art style is adorable it doesn’t have the sheer beauty of some other shows but it fits the story to perfection.
Sound 9/10
The music is great with the opening theme in particular being extremely catchy and the voice acting is absolutely brilliant.
Characters 10/10
I adore Kaguya as a character she is cute and very intelligent as well as being from a family with unmatched wealth but she has also been sheltered and never treated with any real love from her family who have also never allowed her to have the sort of normal life that a child should be able to live in terms of having fun and friends this leads her to be an almost hopeless character at times that I can’t help but cheer on and wish her to be happy.
Miyuki is also an excellent character as President being the perfect match for Kaguya and these characters are both brilliant supported by the council Secretary Chika Fujiwara who is a bright and bubbly person who often hilariously gets in the way of the machinations of Kaguya and Miyuki.
Enjoyment 9/10
A fun and humorous program which never fails to bring a smile to the face.
Overall 9/10",9
"
                Romcom gone off rails
What to expect:
Another romcom? No. A tropic deconstruct of romcoms? Not that either. Isekai? Getting back on track, it's hard to expect kaguya-sama. While it's really different from pretty much every other romcom, it's not a parody nor a tropic deconstructor. You should expect romance and comedy, just not in the same context you've seen from any other high school romcom
Delivery (art/sound/details):
A-1 Pictures makes me hesitate. They seem to enjoy the minimal-viable-product approach. However, here it kind of works. See, most the scenes take place in the student council room, which only has like 8ish distinct camera angles. This let the studio
                  save a lot of time drawing a new background for every scene, when they could mostly reuse the same few good ones. So, in a strange turn of events, the art turned out to be excellent. The sound design is amazing. From a very fitting intro to the narrator's deep voice — which comes through even for us sub watches — I was not disappointed. If you're looking for background details though... well, there are hardly even any side characters to have in the background
Personal experience:
This show is as inconsistent as spring weather. Each episode is divided into 3 sub-arcs, which all vary drastically in enjoyability. Some episodes will have 3-meh arcs, some have 2 mind blowing ones and a decent one, others have one mind blowing one and 2 boring ones. There's no way to predict which is next at all, with the good ones landing all over the place. This creates a serious problem when you jump from a really good arc to a passable one — the contrast can't be more apparent. That said, most the arcs are of good quality and immensely enjoyable, so I found myself really uncertain as to its final score. Most arcs are easily 10s, while others range in the 3-8 scores
Should I watch?
Yes. There are very few people that will genuinely not enjoy the unique comedic approach kaguya-sama takes. Sure you might not like several arcs, though you'll undoubtedly enjoy enough of them to warrant a watch. If you want to trial run, watch episodes 1, 3, and 6. They're a pretty good litmus test. If you're really really not into well written action-packed comedies, then there's a small chance you'll want to pass. Manga readers may also find the manga was somewhat different and better for this season",9
"
                Kaguya-sama doesn't necessarily break any new ground nor deliver a spectacular story, but it is a very entertaining and pleasant experience. The structure of the anime is very much reminiscent of a series of skits, often around three per episodes, which do have a narrative continuity and slowly introduce new characters and relationship elements.
The basic plot is that these two stellar model A students are both interested in each other, but their pride and delusions prevent them from being the first one to admit to the other part that they are interested romantically in eachother. This in turn leads to absurd plots and situations that
                  are often downright hilarious and actually in a few cases really poignant.
The anime relies on it's characters and there is no real plot or moral complexity here. It works because the characters, though based on common stereotypes, have a lot of personality and expressiveness that really makes them endearing. This goes for the entire main cast.
I believe it is a good anime if you want something fun and exaggerated, but it is not a must watch.",7
"
                I really liked watching Love is War. Wasnt all that bad. Romance and comedy usually arent the kinda genres I particularly enjoy, especially together. I did find there were humorous moments, and there were definitely some cute and endearing scenes. I love the idea of Kaguya and Shirogane as a couple, as it is obvious they have this cringe lovey-dovey feeling for one another, however, it does get annoying when you wish they'd just tell the other already, but I guess that's the point of the anime. :/
The only bad points in the anime and why I give it a 7/10 overall... is due to
                  the narrator in every episode. I find the voice highly irritating and don't think a narration throughout an entire episode is even needed. He just tells us what is happening during a scene as if the audience is dumb and can't see for themselves. This then misses out on the chance for the characters to actually communicate more with one another in the episodes. And thus be able to connect with the characters more. And lastly, I do find some episodes or moments in an episode to be rather childish, like the episode where Kaguya laughed every time she heard the word, Wiener. I just found it very cringe. However, this anime is technically for a younger audience so I didn't find it truly bad. Overall Love is War ain't that bad.",7
"
                For all the hype it received when it came out, this show is just kinda… meh. While it does get more enjoyable with time, it remains somewhat underwhelming. The beginning of the show hardly impresses, short of the novel premise the show presents to the romance/high school/seinen genre. That being said, I found the show started to interest me more bit by bit and it does have some funny scenes that are really well thought through, which one might either enjoy a lot, or not so much -- All in all, how good this show is really depends on you as the viewer!
Among the recognisable
                  traits in this series that sets it apart from others, the narrator of the story is probably the most prominent one. Definitely, he plays a key role in providing sports-commentator-like commentaries on the characters’ emotions and plotting with the intent of achieving comedic effect or adding energy to the setting. However, it wouldn’t be a surprise to most to find this narration a little overbearing, especially in the first episode. It can provide a breath of fresh air for some anime watchers but it can also be quite a turn-off for others. In my experience, the first episode felt really underwhelming in terms of excitement and the narrations felt excessive, so that led me to drop the series at the very start… Some scenes just fell flat in my opinion and this could be due to the over exaggeration or perhaps the fact that it isn’t quite to everyone’s personal sense of humour. BUT I decided to give it a shot some months on, and honestly I don’t regret it (mostly cos it led me to like it enough to watch season 2, which I enjoyed a lot more)! The characters are quite likeable and unique, adding a sufficient touch of comedic effect to the show, and the artwork is really nice too, so they had a lot more room to develop in the sequel; all this just didn't shine so much in the first season. 
Overall, I’d say Love is War is worth a shot — you may end up loving it or you may not, but there’s no knowing how much you’ll like it until you watch it yourself!",6
"
                We can summarize the subject of this anime as the fact that two young people who go to a private school and who love each other turn their problems to confess their love to each other into a psychological war and fall into funny situations.
This anime has 2 main characters. Miyuki Shirogane is the president of the student council and Kaguya Shinomiya is the vice president of this council. There are also pretty good and funny side characters in the anime.
An Anime that everyone who loves comedy should watch I throw at least 1 laughs in each episode.
The second season is even better than the
                  first season but still this season is a good season
🤣😂💖👍",8
"
                So honestly, I really didn't expect much from it at the beginning. I really thought it was going to be a banal adaptation with no real interest other than the fun aspect of the series that I had been following in manga for a while.
Already, the opening was a very good surprise, I had no idea what they were going to do at that level and so my expectations for the opening were at the level of my expectations for the anime; absent.
Nevertheless, the opening is excellent, and this first episode is, in my opinion, just as good.
Visually, it's full of ideas and creativity, it's
                  not transcendental, in reality it's not transcendental at all, but coming from A-1 we still feel a good dose of fun from the staff to produce this episode. There are a lot of different little scenes, funny effects here and there depending on what's going on and even if it's not much, we tend to get caught up in the game and have a good time.
As for the ost, I'm not very attentive to this level, but I could nevertheless note that in a single episode, there are a remarkable number of remarkably different ones from each other, from memory I noted 4 or 5 of them and to draw a parallel to what I said just above, we add the ost to the lot and it's all the more pleasant to follow.
Having said that, I still want to mention the work of the seiyuu which is really excellent, I'm not likely to give importance to this part of the work when it's an anime, but in the case of this first episode I found it frankly excellent, especially the one of Shirogane which made me smile. 
Apart from that, I'm going to talk briefly about the work ; Kaguya-sama is a romcom that seems to be quite basic, and it puts a good part of its gags on the status quo introduced in this first episode. The real interest of the work is far from the romance, but rather the comedy which results from it, moreover several sympathetic characters will be added to the cast in the future, and will refresh the work of their presence.",10
"
                I give the Story an nine out of ten because, it make the point across that both of them love/like each other but don't want to say i love you.
I give the Art an 9/10 because it pretty has lots of colors and its stands out and its glowy, too glowy.
I give Sound an 10 out of 10 because it make the sound as what is happening and the music like the Opening are amazing.
 I'll give the Character an 8 out of ten because i hate is that the don't confess there love for each other and try to avoid doing that.
I give Enjoyment
                  a nine out of 10 because theres alot of funny parts and chika is pretty funny.
My Overall Score is a 9/10 because i enjoyed the story the character and the art, pretty good anime.",9

                This show would have been an easy 9 had the anime actually been meaningful in anyway. It's better to enjoy this show as more of a per episode anime rather than focusing more on the story. if you look for a story that goes anywhere you will be disappointed. it was clear at points that the writers put a block in the progression just because and eventually it just became annoying. the jokes were really good though. if they progress the story in s2 then this show is an easy 9 but i just feel it shouldve gone somewhere. the show ended where it started
                  which makes you feel a little cheated.",7

                Score: 9 out of 10.
I normally don't watch comedy, especially Japanese comedy. For me, what they find funny isn't funny. But Kaguya-sama love is war was so high rated that I decided to give it a try - and I'm glad I did. I couldn't stop smiling, laughing and enjoying the show - so much so that I finished this in two days. All of their jokes are insanely well-crafted, funny and unique. This whole anime presents itself as a special type of comedy, completely out of the box. And honestly, I enjoyed it so much. And now I have a new favourite character -
                  Chika. Seriously, she is SO CUTE. The ed should've been her dance all the time, not gonna lie. 
Well, aside from being a smart and funny anime, Kaguya-sama love is war presents itself with a broad number of cool and peculiar characters, skipping the clichés and thinking outside of the box. The plot is pretty much consistent, although the anime is kind of episodic. Still, it's a great rom-com to binge watch and have fun.",9
"
                Let's start off with the obvious.
It's very easy to see why this anime is as popular as it is. It ticks all the boxes for what to expect from a romantic comedy for a lot of people.
That being said, this anime leans much heavily into comedy than it does romance, despite the title. Watching those two geniuses try an outsmart each other makes up the bulk of the main conflict in the show and holy shit, they went all out.
Dramatic reactions, crazy camera angles, a VERY effective narrator backed by an energetic OST, all of these elements combine to make that outsmarting, inner dialogue sections
                  really interesting to watch. Sure, the conflict is predictable, but they try their best to keep it fresh by introducing different situations and making use of uncontrollable variables, namely Fujiwara.
It is ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS. If there's one thing that this show gets right, it's the comedy. Despite a few okay repeating gags, most of the comedy is kept interesting throughout. There definitely some laugh out loud moments that are quite memorable.
Another strong point was the art style. The mind conflict scenes makes use of very pretty looking backdrops that really do add a lot to the visual character of the show itself. Reactions of the characters can really be felt by the viewer, which is a job well done in my book.
I especially liked Kaguya's eye design. It almost looks like there is a blood red city in her eyes, which enables her to be cute and terrifying based on context. She somehow manages to be more expressive in emotion that Fujiwara somehow, despite her being the more reserved type. Unfortunately, this cannot be said for Shirogane.
This brings me to character personalities. What Shirogane lacks in design, he very much makes up for in the personality department. 
While Kaguya also manages to keep up an interesting persona, ultimately it's hard to NOT view Shirogane as the underdog as he tries to swerve and dodge his way through Kaguya's plans. Shirogane has MUCH more comedic value than Kaguya however. This leads to me being much more endeared with Shirogane's character rather than that of Kaguya.
All the other characters also manage to have enough of a personality to keep up with the two MCs. In my opinion, four well fleshed out characters will always be better that many interesting characters.
The anime does seem to fall into the typical rich person cliches a lot. This is not helped by the fact that there isn't that much romance for most of the series before we get slapped with it at the end. Still, I enjoyed it.
At last, the AMAZING intro deserves a mention. Everyone's absorbed by the Chika Dance, but the intro has a great music track that goes super well with the whole James Bond style aesthetic. Never skipped it once.
Overall, it's important to consider what you WANT from a romantic comedy. That will help you determine your affinity towards it.
I wanted a hilarious anime to watch that would have interesting characters with a great art style. I couldn't care too much about the romance.
Based on that, this anime is PERFECT. It does what I wanted to an exceptional degree and that's probably why I've given it a 10. 
As for you the viewer, assuming your views doesn't line up with mine, I would still recommend giving it a watch just plainly because of how funny the show is. It's THAT good.",10
"
                Kaguya-sama: Love Is War is a great representation of a good anime adaptation.
The premise of the story is interesting enough to hook me in at first glance: What will happened if two tsunderes love each other? This anime will show you how hilarious it is. The little downside of this anime is how there is kind of little progress going on with the couple. Unlike major rom-com like Toradora or Sakurasou, the show focuses on what the couple battle each other which usually end up comedic, making it quite clear that these two barely make progress on the romance side.
However, this point got overcome by
                  how good they adapted from the manga. As a manga reader, this anime got adapted to the core, not to mention the voice actors did their job very well, probably one of the most effective I've ever seen. Many scenes in the anime didn't come directly from the manga, which means the animators decide to work on their own. References from movies, real-life figures and even anime make Kaguya-sama more engaging and relate to the humour when it is aired.
Characters, as I said, there isn't really a deep development to it. What is Kaguya like in the first episode? She will be quite the same on the last episode. But don't be afraid, characters in Kaguya-sama have a backstory and things are going to change for sure. Now what you can do is enjoy the battle of who is going to confess first, and get a good laugh from it.
I enjoy this anime a lot. Even though many of us read the manga before, the director knows how to entertain the viewer and make it as good as the manga. Though I think this anime is quite overhyped, don't let it scare you, because this anime is worth getting into for sure.
Overall: 9/10",9

                [ENG]
You fall in love with someone, confess that love, and become a couple...Everyone woul say that’s a wonderful thing...but they’re wrong! In all relationships, there is a side that exploits and a side that’s exploited, a side that’s devoted and a side receiving devotion, a winner and a loser, and the person who falls in love loses! Love is war! Wait a minute...before anything, breathe a little and relax, now let's try to understand that better
Kaguya-sama, or Love is War if you prefer, is an Anime produced in 2019 by A-1 Pictures Studios, Aka Akasaka's original work, and in it we see this premise through
                  the students of the renowned Shuchiin Academy, especially in the characters that are part of the Student Council
Let's start with its president, Miyuki Shirogane is one of the institution's best students, a genius in studies and an example for the rest of the students, and there isn't a single person who don't admire his presence. To stand beside him, it couldn't be none other than his vice president
Kaguya Shinomiya is talented in several areas in relation to Miyuki, but the difference is that her family is one of the richest and most powerful in all of Japan, the Shinomiya group. Words like money and power have been part of her life since she was born, so people have always treated her differently, knowing her importance and influence in the institution
Before I continue, I need to tell you something very important: this is a secret, so don't tell anyone, okay? Miyuki and Kaguya, they are in love with each other! Yes, I know, crazy to imagine that an Anime called ""Love is War"" would have this premise, right? But the point is that, even with this premise that can be considered ""basic"", Kaguya-sama explores it perfectly, giving us a real representation of a teen romance
Regardless of the media, we're used to reading or watching teen novels that the characters are already very mature emotionally, but if we think about it, that's not the case in real life, of course that maturity is not something tied only to age, but in this specific phase of life, when we don't know ourselves completely and with uncontrollable hormones, “maturity and stability” are the last things we expect from someone
Kaguya-sama is one of my favorite Animes, because thanks to its captivating characters and real relationships, I was able to connect and remember this intense and memorable period of my life...maybe there really is this ""power struggle"" in a relationship, and the idea that “Love is war” is not that absurd, but in the end, is it worth worrying about it? When it comes to love, intelligence and logic doesn't fit in that equation, so how can you expect the brain to understand something that was created by your heart?
Bellow there is a video link, entitled “Love is...War?”, which better analyzes the Anime and its premise as a whole, making this review even more accurate (Please turn on the English Sub for it).
[PT-BR]
Você se apaixona por alguém...confessa o amor para essa pessoa...e vocês se tornam um casal...isso parece ser algo maravilhoso, não é?...mas você está errado! Em todos os relacionamentos tem quem manda e quem obedece, que é devoto e quem recebe essa devoção, quem vence e quem perde e, quem se apaixona primeiro, é o perdedor! Amor é guerra! Calma, calma, calma...antes de mais nada respira um pouco e vamos entender melhor essa história.
Kaguya-sama, ou Love is War se preferir, é um Anime produzido em 2019 pelos estúdios A-1 Pictures, obra original de Aka Akasaka, e nele acompanhamos essa premissa através dos alunos da renomada Shuchiin Academy, em especial os personagens que fazem parte do Conselho Estudantil.
Vamos começar pelo seu presidente, Miyuki Shirogane é um dos melhores alunos da instituição, gênio nos estudos e exemplo para o resto dos alunos, e não tem uma pessoa sequer que não fique admirado com sua presença. Para andar ao lado dele, não poderia ser ninguém menos que a sua vice-presidente.
Kaguya Shinomiya é talentosa em diversas áreas em relação ao Miyuki, mas a diferença é que sua família é uma das mais ricas e poderosas de todo o Japão, o grupo Shinomiya. Palavras como dinheiro e poder já fazem parte de sua vida desde que ela nasceu, então as pessoas sempre trataram ela de maneira diferente, sabendo de sua importância e influência na instituição.
Antes de continuar, eu preciso contar algo muito importante: isso é um segredo, então não conta para ninguém tá? Miyuki e Kaguya, eles estão apaixonados um pelo outro!...Sim, eu sei, loucura imaginar que uma obra que se chama “Love is War” teria essa premissa, né? Mas a grande questão é que, mesmo com essa premissa que pode ser considerada “básica”, Kaguya-sama a explora com perfeição, nos dando uma real representação de um romance adolescente.
Independente da mídia, estamos acostumados a ler ou assistir romances adolescentes onde os personagens apresentam uma grande maturidade em relacionamentos, mas se pararmos para pensar, não é bem assim que acontece na vida real, claro que maturidade não é algo atrelado apenas a idade, mas nessa fase específica da vida, quando não nos conhecemos por completo e com os hormônios a flor da pele, “maturidade e estabilidade” são as últimas coisas que esperamos de alguém.
Kaguya-sama é uma das minhas obras favoritas, pois graças a seus personagens cativantes e relacionamentos reais, eu consegui me conectar e relembrar desse período tão intenso e memorável da minha vida...talvez de fato exista essa disputa de poderes em um relacionamento, e a ideia de que “Amor é guerra” não seja tão absurda assim, mas no final das contas, vale a pena se preocupar com isso? Quando se trata de amor, inteligência e lógica não tem espaço nessa equação, então como você pode esperar que o cérebro entenda algo que foi criado pelo coração?
Segue o link do vídeo, intitulado de “Amor é...Guerra?”, que analisa melhor a obra e sua premissa como um todo, tornando essa review ainda mais precisa.

                Amazing Characters,Story and plot along with some of the best Rom-Com comedy...
The characters are absolutely lovely chika being my favorite..
Seeing the main antagonists go back and forth expressing their love for each other lights up your heart..
The humor is also spot on....
The side characters and side story's also add a specific spice to the show..
The story and Plot is absolutely amazing,the starting shows us our two main characters who have feeling for each other, and we see their journey expressing their love for each other,the comedy with the side characters and their part plays a important piece of why this show is so good..
It just
                  lights up your heart watching kaguya and miyuki challenging each other into who will express their love first,chika being the best background character i have ever seen also plays her part in their journey and her slight pinch of comedy and humor makes the show so delightful..",9
"
                I'll be straightforward and say I have struggled to get through this anime. If you are watching this because people are telling you this is the best anime every please lower your expectations. For me, I think the hype ruined the enjoyment I would have had.
I watched it when it first came out and saw a few episodes (~5) with my friends. Normally watching something with someone who enjoys it makes the experience much more enjoyable. I however didn't pick up the show again until years later only to drop it a second time after a few episodes. After seeing the final season at the
                  top of MAL I decided to see why everyone on TT was saying what an amazing *shoujo* this was and how it deserved #1. Third time was the charm for me when it came to finishing this season.
---
Comedy is subjective.
I was recommended to try the dub and I will say that did help, but the show was still very hit or miss for me. This is a romcom so of course humor is going to be subjective, but to be honest the main part of the show was probably what I found the least funny. The Kaguya vs Shirogane battles. The second half of the season was much better for me because of the cast expanding and the skits not revolving so heavily on these 1v1s between the love interests. Shirogane and Fujiwara I found to be funny together. Tbh imo Fujiwara is the best part of the show. I like the little games she comes up with and how she is an element of chaos for these mind games the love interests are playing. I like when Kai and Ishigami were added because the jokes revolved less on these overdramatic 1v1s. They still occurred, but now at least different characters were involved and they could throw things off or provide a new perspective.
---
This is definitely not a shoujo.
So some people think shoujo means romance I guess. But this is very far from shoujo. This is a romcom so obviously targeted at adult men. What do you know. It's a seinen romance. I think I got more irritated than I normally would have because I was told this was shoujo. The romance in this is okay. There are times where I do think it does a good job of showing those first love/having a crush feelings. There are some genuinely heartfelt moments, but the romance in this isn't really anything that special. And that's perfectly fine. I think hype didn't meet my expectations and I was left disappointed especially after what happened in episode 9.
Episode 9 left a bitter taste in my mouth. Ishigami, a character I like, gives a very incel response to a situation that occurred revolving around consent. Meanwhile a female character gives what I felt was the appropriate response to said situation. I wasn't a huge fan of the situation period. Knowing people who have gone through a similar situation and hearing the male perspective Ishigami gave hit a little too close to real life. 
*SPOILERS FOR EP9 & EP10*
Kaguya is delirious with a fever and apparently when she's this sick she has no memories of what happens during that time. Convenient. Shirogane comes over with her homework along with some snacks and drinks to help her feel better. The maid invites him in and while he resists at first he is brought to her room. Then the maid leaves and says how the room is sound proof and no one will bother them for 3 hours. What the actual fuck. Like seriously. I thought she was joking and would be surveilling the room cuz you know. Kaguya is essentially the equivalent of black out drunk. But nope. Anyway Kaguya wants to snuggle of course so she drags Shirogane into bed with her. He then falls asleep next to her. She wakes up to find him there and freaks out before kicking him out. Her maid investigates the bed and says ""looks like he didn't do anything inappropriate."" Wtf. 
The next day they get advice from friends and Ishigami says how if Shirogane didn't do anything then he has nothing to apologize for. BUT HE DID DO SOMETHING. He went in her bed and fell asleep w/o her consent. Kaguya couldn't consent to anything, but Ishigami is making her sound like a floozy who takes advantage of men. Shirogane only apologizes because he touched her lips. He didn't see getting into bed with her and falling asleep as inappropriate or worth apologizing over. 
*END OF SPOILERS/RANT*
If it weren't for those two episodes and the show wasn't hyped up so much I think I would have liked this show more. I also liked the finale because it was less focused on the scheming of a confession. It was people who genuinely cared for one another wanting to be being there for each other. It was wholesome and sweet. 
My hopes for the following seasons:
Add more people to the cast. Adding Ishigami alone made the show more interesting. I like the dynamics between everyone vs just Shirogane and Kaguya. More Fujiwara. Maybe more training with Fujiwara cuz that was fun. Less ice queen Kaguya. I generally enjoy tsundere characters, but I enjoy seeing more of her dere moments then when she's being cold and calculated. Also if Shirogane could stop constantly imagining ""That's so cute."" I'm assuming the 3rd season is going to end with them together so I'm hoping to see more moments between Kaguya and Shirogane that show how much they actually care for each other. Make me want to root for them! I'm hoping I'll like season 2 more.",7
"
                For me, a romcom normie, its pretty hard on finding a decent romcom anime. Until my friends recommended me this series. After watching this season of Kaguya-sama, I was surprised on how perfect it is. To be honest, there are some flaws here and there but overall, its not noticeable at all. For any romcom lover, heck even all anime watchers, I would highy recommend this. The amount of effort put onto this series is just amazing to look at. I have never experienced simping someone so fast either. For me, I would rate this show a hefty 10/10. [So yeah, thats all. But MAL
                  says to write a longer paragraph so nevermind this section] KAGUYA SIMP KAGUYA SIMP KAGUYA SIMP KAGUYA SIMP KAGUYA SIMP",10
"
                When this came out last year I was skeptical about, You know, another anime of girl falls in love, go out, etc. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not here to trash at the anime or other ones ; there are a few that are ok nothing more, nothing less (Anywhooo). Here in 2020 with a lot of time on my hands. So i said 'why not' and gave it a go. 
It did not disappoint 
This is a good anime for the laughs, thrills, and suspense. And your always gonna be wondering who will break and say ' I Love You"" First. You'll always
                  be asking 'he's gonna break, no she's gonna break"" and I bet you that once you start watching an anime you will choose a side. Ether on  Shinomiya's side or Shirogane's side.",9
"
                This anime for the most part takes place in the student council room, where constantly for the next 12 chapters we will see President Shirogane and Vice President Shinomiya, two prodigy students, compete with each other to see who declares their love for the other first. Our two main characters invented different strategies for the other to confess their love, because yes, both are aware that they like each other, but they have so many insecurities and a thirst for victory that they do not dare to say ""I like you""
Personally, the anime was a roller coaster of entertaining and boring me, there were times
                  when I was tired of watching the same thing, since it became repetitive and predictable. However, the battles and occurrences of the protagonists were sometimes entertaining. The occurrences of these two and their very exact way of thinking at times seemed funny to me.
I really don't know if I would recommend this anime.",7
"
                For those who want to see a romance anime where the mc and heroine building a relationship each other through the story this anime is not for you, because guess what, everyone who expect that giving an awful rating in this review. But if you want to see a comedic that being delivered in unique way this anime is for you.
Its about 2 highshooler who love each other but they dont want to confess it due to their high pride, so they use many things to make a condition where their ""partner"" got forced to confess first, yeah that is basically all but you will
                  see how they use psychological and things like that, but warning if you expecting something like your favorite psychological dynamic and complexity anime this anime doesnt reach their level, better to not expect that much otherwise maybe you will also give an awful rating like the other who say this anime overrated just because doesnt have very high complexity and dynamic psychological like their fav anime

"
                This is a fitting show to talk about after having just reviewed The Tale of the Princess Kaguya considering everything I said about that Ghibli movie checks out with this standard rom-com season one... just with less emphasis on either the good or bad side. To me, trying to compare these two experiences is like choosing between getting a 100mph steel ball the size of a baseball thrown into your shin or getting shot in the same place with a sniper rifle. The force is relatively similar, only one hurts much more in a sharp way while the other is just blunt.
So, what makes me
                  make these comparisons? Well, they share the same structure of having a good buildup to a bad ending, but beyond that these two shows splinter in very different paths. First off, let me make something very clear here; this show is hilarious. It only gets better with time, of course, but even so season one still isn't nearly as unfunny as I remember it being. The directors and VAs have absolutely done overkill exactly as it should be in every rom-com that features it.
Beyond that, though, this show is pretty average. Not bad by any means, but not really redeeming beyond how comedically rich it is. So, we have a humorous but rather normal rom-com on our hands for the majority of the runtime, but there is one thing that still has to be addressed; the ending. The ending of this show is exactly like Rent A Girlfriend's; a complete flat ground hanger that leaves the viewer wondering why on earth the studio split the anime in two at such a place. It is infuriating on a very personal level, and for the longest time I had this whole show ranked at a 3/10 for nothing more than the ending. But then I got to thinking, and eventually I realized something - Rent A Girlfriend's ending pisses me off because the show has nothing to offer from start to finish, and the ending does nothing to change this. With Kaguya-sama season one, the ending still doesn't accomplish anything, but the benefit of a flat ground hanger ending is that there is nothing ventured, either. No risk is taken in this situation and nothing is lost.
So, in the end, this show is a consistently fine but very funny experience that I would recommend if only for the amazing sequel seasons that it helped create.",7
"
                A cut above the rest in terms of your typical romantic comedy in anime. The main premise has the two protagonists, who like each other, attempt to make the other confess instead of themselves due to some absurd and immature ideas of love and power that they have: the premise is funny enough but has the potential to get boring very quickly. Luckily for us, it doesn't follow this strict format throughout the whole show and allows itself to explore other characters and different scenarios.
The main plot progresses faster than the pace of other romantic comedies, yet still manages to be a tad slow and
                  the plot itself is nothing we haven’t seen before countless of times.
What makes the show better than its peers are the humor and the characters: these are better written than what they tend to be and makes it a more than enjoyable show to watch. As the show (and other seasons) go on it gives time to the side characters to shine, and it works quite well because of their good writing.
Nothing spectacular but the characters are well written enough and the humor usually works really well.

"
                <Potential Spoilers>
I find this anime to be alright.
Many people love this anime and I can certainly understand why, although it doesn't suit my taste. The absurd but interesting story, fair art style, and animation, good sound design, and interesting characters craft an absurd but fun story.
The narrative that follows this anime is full of absurd and entertaining moments, at first, it feels beyond weird and just not right. I found that the first episode was shoving different things in my face. However, after a while, each episode felt unique, original, and entertaining. I was enjoying many different aspects of the show and I can say
                  I truly enjoy this show.
The art style is effective at what it does, nothing groundbreaking but is effective nonetheless. Although the art style does one amazing thing, where it overemphasizes different scenes. Key scenes use animation to overemphasize things done by the characters that are considered relatively normal. I found this to be an interesting and entertaining part of the anime.
The sound design was nothing too special, The music made certain scenes appear more intense. Everyone loved the opening and while I enjoyed the opening it was nothing amazing, just something I could enjoy. The voice acting was also something that was performed well, each voice actor portrays each character greatly and makes the show so much more entertaining.
The characters are where the show is best. Miyuki and Kaguya are the centre characters, their feelings towards each other are very clear and they both approach these feelings by treating them like a conflict. This is the clear focus of the anime and something I find to be entertaining.
Love is War is an anime that while I consider enjoyable, I don't love like the majority of people. The anime itself is put together with an absurd narrative, great art style, good sound design, and character conflicts.
Overall, I rank this 7/10.",7
"
                This anime perfectly embodies the best from the Romcom and slice-of-life genres. Whenever my computer opened it and I put on the anime, I was guaranteed to laugh, and my day was guaranteed to brighten up a little bit. The plot is fantastic and the mood knows how to perfectly adapt based on the situation in the series. One of the Best animes ever released. Guaranteed happiness all the way through this season. 
This will also be a review for seasons 2 and 3 as well, because it's just simpler for me that way :| 
!!! I will copy and paste this review in seasons
                  2 and 3 !!!
Story: 9/10
At first, I admit that I disliked their idea of love. I honestly never thought of it as a battle, where the first one to fall loses. I, in fact, almost dropped the anime over this. That was until I realized that all that was really just an excuse to try and get the other party to confess in order to protect their pride as student council members. The way they approach love once you realize that is, in fact, genius. The way their approach to love slowly devolves from a ""I'll make you confess"" into a ""please just confess already"" is almost as if they were in an actual war, suffering from exhaustion, which is just fantastic. The 1st season finale itself, in my opinion, deserved its own review. Everything from the animation to the plot is beautifully executed in it. As for the Finale of season, I believe the season itself beautifully leads it on, planting subtle hints all throughout the season. The third season finale, then, is beyond my word-finding capacity. The animation is what catches my attention at first, but the story itself, also draws me in, with the both of them basically confessing to each other.
Art and Animation: 9/10
The Art and Animation are, for me, life-or-death for an anime. Which is precisely why Kaguya-Sama gets a 9 out of 10 from me. The art is gorgeous, and everything from the Uniform to the school halls perfectly embodies the posh vibe that Shuchiin Academy needs for its story to hold up. The animation should honestly be a textbook example on how lighting affects a scene, especially in the episodes such as the season one finale and the season 3, where the lighting of the Fireworks in season 1 greatly impact the scene's overall mood and feel, and the warm lighting of the Campfire reflecting off the pink, heart-shaped baloons in season 3 give the scene the heartwarming, romantic feel that it very much needs to make the scene remarkable.
Characters: 8/10
The characters are all remarkable and well developed throughout the series, however, there's only one problem I see with them: the number. There's an immense number of characters as the series progresses, and it gets pretty hard to keep track of them after a while. Still, all of them are beautifully done and have actual meaningful backstories, no matter how big of a supporting character they are. The best example for this is Ishigami. Who barely shows up through the first season, and his seldom appearances have his gloomy attitude as the center of attention, then, however, his backstory is revealed in the second season, and everything about his being is explained.
Soundtrack: 10/10
Masayuki Suzuki did an amazing job all throughout the three seasons launched so far, perfectly reflecting the ""war exhaustion "" feel described a few paragraphs back. Starting with ""Love Dramatic,"" By him and Rikka Ihara. The swing rhythm fits the series perfectly, with its accelerated beat fitting the underlying theme of competition. Followed by ""DADDY! DADDY! DO!"" By masayuki Suzuki and Airi Suzuki. Once again, the swing returns, but this time with a more of a soft rock feel to it, giving it a more romantic feel. Finally, there's ""GIRI GIRI,"" from Masayuki and Suu. A light, romantic rhythm with the swing feel to it. A great way to subtly show a wearing down of the ""love battle"" facade. 
Another amazing feature shown throughout Kaguya-Sama is their capacity to put the cast to sing. Starting in ""Chikatto Chika Chika,"" at the end of season 1, which perfectly embodies the goofy nature of Chika's character. I personally don't remember if there were any special OPs or EDs in season 2, but the ED for S3 E4, ""My Nonfiction"" by Shirogane Miyuki and Fujiwara Chika follows the logical flow of the Episode's story of perfectly (and we get to hear Chika rapping, which is quite the experience). Along with the special OPs and EDs, they also put the cast to sing the regular ones, albeit not through the season, but in the ""KAGUYA ULTRA BEST"" album. In it, we have ""Love Dramatic,"" By Shirogane Miyuki and Shinomyia Kaguya, ""DADDY! DADDY! DO!"" By Ishigami and Iino, as well as songs from the OVAs and ONAs, all by the Cast Voices. 
Overall 10/10: 
Everything from the Soundtrack, to the plot, to the animation just hits the spot perfectly. It embraces the Romance, Comedy, and Slice-of-Life genres when it needs to, and beautifully embodies the battle of wits that it's described as. This anime is a must watch. 
At the end of the day, however, every review is just an opinion. You are free to disagree, though I'd definitely think you're missing out by not watching it.",10

                Oww what an amazing unexpected delight!
I was recommend this plenty, but I was afraid there'd be your typical cliche anime humor that I'm not into. But actually, the humor was really good!
On top of that, the art and animation is great, the music is pretty sweet, and I quite adore the characters! I love the ridiculous dynamics between the two, and the amount of personality they have. Perhaps the biggest show-stealer however, is one of the side characters, who's just so much fun.
The narrator as well, he's pretty much a character in itself! I thought it was a bit strange at first, but he does
                  add to it, and it helps to further elevate the ridiculousness of the situation. ""he started shadowboxing for no reason!"", hah! x)
There's not much story; it's mostly just skits in the council room, or at the beach, or in the gym, etc. But they are totally fine, and there is progression. Not only do you get to know the characters more, there are some threads connecting it all, and it does all build up to the fireworks in the end, which was a wonderful thing to end on.
Without a doubt, it'll put a smile on your face. :)",9

                It was slightly difficult to get into the hang of how things went with this anime, but after taking a few months' long break about 6 episodes i, I finally got the motivation to finish the first season at the very least. 
I was initially slightly bothered by how these two dumbasses refused to do things the normal way, but in the end I rooted for these two just get together real hard. Now as I am typing this review, the back-to-back-to-back-to-back inner monologue of trying to be a step ahead of the other person is a good stab at cliches shown in all kinds
                  of anime, not just shoujo. 
The badly pronounced English every now and then as well as the narrator trying to have a serious voice throughout the episodes was hilarious, I love him lol",9
"
                As an anime newbie, it's very hard to first get used to anime and figure out what is good, what is bad and what it is that you like or enjoy due to the abundance of genres, styles and complexities of it but I was glad that I chose to watch this as my first few.
It is Hilarious ! I found myself laughing to some of the oddest and weirdest jokes that should not work or should be cringey but they were executed so well that everything passes as a terrific skit. The narrator has to be the best character of the series and the
                  power of their witty, sometimes dark humor really pushes the boundaries of what comedy is.
The characters are all brilliant, everyone brings something to the table and have such distinct voices and personalities. Even if Yu Ishigami was introduced a little later in the series, I could welcome him with open arms due to the way the plot quickly but naturally drags him in. The dynamic between them is explored in every episode and you can't help to want to know more about each one.
I think I came in with a mindset that it would be romantic shojo anime that takes itself a little seriously but then I was surprised with hard-hitting comedy and even some specific and sad backstories that took the wind out of me! So it's best to go in blind and enjoy wherever this anime takes you, and remember to loosen up as you watch. 
It also ends with such a beautiful and dreamy ending that implores you to hop on to season 2 right away. masterpiece !",10
"
                (Watched with Japanese audio/ English subtitles) 
I'm going to start this off with my usual issues with anime. Inappropriate genre tags.
Seeing psychological tags on this anime irks me. In no way, shape, nor form does this anime demonstrate the use of more than a couple of brain cells. 
And it points that very fact out multiple times through the episodes. 
Psychological tag does not belong. [End rant] 
This show is a romcom. A collection of skit comedies. Hilarious ones at that. 
If you enjoyed Asobi Asobase, Saiki K, or Sakamoto then there's a good chance you're going to enjoy this show. 
Being a skit comedy, the story is non existent outside of its outline in this season. Two teens, trying to get the other to confess. Using over thought ideas that never pan out. You get what's written on the tin. 
The art, while not ground breaking, does its job of delivering the punch line to whatever is going on. And it does it well. 
Despite being a skit comedy, or perhaps because it is one, every character is fleshed out. You see growth from every character. And you see revisits. The characters are the soul of this anime. 
If you are in the market for comedy. And I mean pure comedy. Then I would recommend this without a doubt. 
If you're wanting something smart and edgy, then pass on this. Love isn't smart.",8

                Kaguya-sama: Love is War is a series I didn't think I would enjoy. I was new to this whole anime thing still, having only watched Demon Slayer, My Hero Academia, Sword Art Onlne, and a couple other popular shows. Romcoms didn't sound appealing. I'm glad I was wrong. It was really one of Gigguk's videos that got me interested. Two tsunderes try to make the other confess. I watched it to balance the amount of shonens I had watched and I'm now more into different types of anime. The story to this anime is fine. I don't pay to much attention to it and it
                  wasn't to procative in the thought department. It was very inoffensive. I was here for the comedy skits. Art was great in this series, but it gets better in the next season. Nothing too crazy, just some memorable designs without relying on hair colors (other than Chika). Sound is good. The VAs are great at their jobs. The OP is really nice sounding, and of course Chika's ED is a banger. Characters can feel one note, but sometimes they change octaves. My enjoyment is immeasurable, and my day is made. I thought the skits were hilarious and it finally helped me understand more memes. Overall, a high quality show with some great humor. Not a masterpiece, but a memorable work. 8/10",8

"
                9/10 Probably my favorite anime of all time.
Usually something that is considered my favorite doesn't always mean it's ""the best thing ever made"", it's just something I personally enjoyed more than others. Kaguya-sama fits that really well.
The premise is simple: Boy and Girl like each other, but cannot confess as it would show a sign of weakness to the other. So what do they do? They try to get each other to confess to them. And what comes of this is HILARIOUS. Many moments I felt like ""this is way too ridiculous just to have someone confess to them"" but that was exactly what made
                  the show great to me.
The characters are great and even with their personalities being completely opposite from each other, they still work well together. The way the two MC's try to outsmart each other, while the others may sometimes thwart their plans makes the dynamic even funnier in the end.
One of my favorite parts, surprisingly, was the inclusion of the narrator. It is was such a unique choice implemented from the manga, and the VA did an amazing job.
Don't even get me started on the OP for this show. All I am going to say is it's fantastic and one of the best OP's I've heard in any anime.
So, in short, just go watch this because I want to share my favorite anime with everyone.",9
"
                Now that I have fully seen the Anime, it just validates my points.
The viewer never finds out why the main characters, especially Kaguya, act this awfully. There is literally no plot and so no reason for them not to confess their love. This is easily the most boring and sensless romcom I have ever watched. (Not the worst though) 
This Anime had a great premise. At the first episode I got hyped over two dominant characters and creative brainbattles! No one can deny, that the animation is really the peak of this anime. But animations isn't everything...
In the same exact episode, the premise drops 10
                  stories down, when I realized, Kaguya isn't really dominant. In fact, many scenes show, that she wants to be dominated by Miyuki. 
The two main characters are just bland and at most times hopeless. Their actions are laughable, cause they act soooooo cool, while being dumb as hell. The brainbattles were keeping this Anime on a 5 for me. But it is hard to say they are genius, when the characters are just laughably stupid. I changed my score to a 3, after watching these two screaming and whining like little toddlers because of a shortcake for 7 minutes. And Kaguya laughing about the word ""wiener"" for 5 minutes... 
It is like seeing two people act like they have an IQ of 130, while they are as dumb as those antivax karens on facebook. It isn't funny. Yeah I said it. It isn't funny. Ai, Kaguya's maid, was literally how I felt watching the anime. 
When people say, this is as genius as death note, they couldn't have possibly watched death note. Or they say, it is the best romcom. Did they watch Toradora? Golden Time or Bunny girl senpai? Or actual genius comedies that use stereotypes and break them: Sora no Otoshimono.
And everything I write here isn't really a spoiler, cause you can see this from miles away by just watching episode 1 or 2. 
The main characters became kinda annoying. Cause there is literally NO reason why Kaguya acts this way other than plot convenience. Miyuki has actual dominant thoughts and makes his actions kinda believable. But it is just convenient for him, that Kaguya shapes herself to become ""non dominant"" to be his type of girl. Heck! EVERY STEREOTYPICAL JAPANESE MAN STEREOTYPICAL GIRLFRIEND. He doesn't even have to move his little pinky for her to become his girl. And by the end, again, this anime became like every stereotypical, bland romance, in which the girl blushes hard and is too stupid to confess to senpai. And again, you can see, that this is the ending by just watching episode 1 or 2.
It is a tale as old as time: The main characters are both so socially awkward, it hurts. And all their problems vanish, when they just become a couple. They are each others saviors. And by the end of the anime the girl becomes everyones desired stereotypical girlfriend, who blushes, wants to be dominated, stays at home, takes care of the children, cooks and by the end of any anime, loses her whole character. It is concerning that still so many people love that type of storytelling and still don't get how one sided the main girls are written in Anime. And how blind, boring and socially stupid Anime protagonists are written.
Why is it so hard to create anime guys and girls, that aren't so friggin stereotypical and hopeless?
I just hope, that people, who like this anime, don't think, that being like those characters is desirable or entertaining.",3
"
                Animations are ridiculously and surprisingly perfect. I first thought that its an ordinary romantic-comedy time waster like various animes but its actually an enjoyable time waster. Without exaggeration animations and songs are top class. I like the debate theme they used its pretty fun to watch. But one thing I didn't like is the explainer guy. I think making explanations means kinda underestimate the audience. Considering the anime fan base that's a reasonable call but still it makes me disturbed. There are small and some big logical errors such as if this Shirogane guy is that genius then why he doesn't choose to obey and
                  follow one and only goddess Chika-sama? There are also small and good details that make the anime more enjoyable. So basically Love is War is a very very enjoyable anime with minor mistakes that I can ignore.",8
"
                SUMMARY: If you like romantic comedies you have to see it (even if you don't like them, give it a chance).
This anime is more comedy than romance, but the twist that it gives to things makes it really different from what is usually seen, it has charming characters, it is an episodic anime but each chapter continues to advance in the story, in each chapter something really interesting or funny happens, if you are a fan of romcoms you have to see it, even if you are not you could give it a try.
RESUMEN:Si te gustan las comedias romanticas tienes que verlo (aunque no te
                  gusten dale un chance).
Este anime es más comedia que romance, pero el giro que le da a las cosas, hace que realmente sea diferente a lo que se ve usualmente, tiene personajes encantadores, es un anime episodico pero que cada capitulo sigue avanzando en la historia, en cada capitulo ocurre algo realmente interesante o gracioso, si eres fan de las romcom tienes que verlo, incluso aunque no lo seas podrías darle una oportunidad.",7
"
                tl;dr:A comedic series about an extremely competitive romance that while amusing feels a bit disappointing in how little actually happens.
This anime is primarily centered around two characters and a very unique relationship they have come to have due to both clearly being in love but being too prideful to allow themselves to show that to the other. It is structured such that each episode is composed of multiple stories centered around different small events, though there is continuity between theses at times, and the focus of each of these for the most part is comedy. The relationship itself and how the two characters take part
                  in it is incredibly interesting. It's essentially takes the love is a battlefield concept to a ridiculous level for comedic purposes, and uses it to its fullest framing every action taken as a strategic move and every event that occurs as a battle in an ongoing war. And thanks to the personalities of the characters involved it works really well, with the two being incredibly similar in how both are incredibly prideful in some regards but with major insecurities in others and how they're both treating love as a competition, but with differences due to each having different strengths and weaknesses in what moves they make and how they aim to acheive victory in this competition. It's a very unique sort of relationship and one very different from any I've seen in any fiction, but despite that it does feel like they have really good chemistry which makes them worth rooting for. The two other main characters also have interesting and likable personalities that work well in spicing up the show and keeping things different. Due to all of that, and just in general things being written pretty well, each short story is interesting with solid comedy and hence it never feels like the show is dragging on.
With that said, this is very much an example of a series where each story is light and ultimately nothing changes. This is something that is present throughout, but due to the events in the final episode feeling more weighty than the standard comedic affair and hence feeling like they should have more impact, but ultimately still having none, the ending is where this is most strongly felt. Holistically, things at the end of the series are exactly as they were at the beginning. The main relationship dynamic was established prior to the start of the series, and unlike a lot of other series that start with a similar concept, showing how it came to be through flashbacks doesn't occur either. There is some minor development of side relationships within the student council and development of a relationship  in a reoccurring side story but nothing in regards to the main relationship. There were parts that highlighted aspects of characters personalities, of which the final episode is the most prominent, but ultimately there was no character development either and more surprisingly it didn't feel like we got much background either. For a twelve episode series centered around a relationship, in the end it really doesn't feel like we learned enough about that relationship or the characters in that relationship, and hence while it was amusing throughout, it's hard to get truly invested in the relationship or characters and hence doesn't feel like it's left any sort of lasting impression.
The art and animation were very well done. The designs themselves were okay. The OP and EDs were solid in audio and visuals, especially the Chika ED that showed up once. The soundtrack wasn't particularly memorable.",8

*SPOILER-FREE*
Being one of the favourite shows of the anime community, “Kaguya-sama: Love is War” is an all-time great romantic comedy that took the genre to new hights. And being one of A-1 Pictures flagship anime adaptation, they keep outdoing themselves each season.
One of the problems when it comes to comedy in anime is that some of the tropes and punchlines become overused and the sarcastic and meta jokes get also not so funny really quick. However, the art-style and scenes that A-1 Pictures are able to create helps every episode deliver be it in comedy or serious moments. The animation
                  and creativity of the setups and situations that arise are what makes this show so captivating and enjoyable to watch.
In addition, the cast of characters was very well developed put together in a way where it is really hard to not like at least one of them, something that in priceless when you consider that the characters, and their decisions and action, are what make the show so damn good. The pacing is well done and helps the audience to appreciate and get invested in the world and characters surrounding the MC’s.
All things said, “Kaguya-sama: Love is War” is probably one of the best in the genre with a legendary set of characters that are exciting and fun to watch deal with their problems and dilemmas. Plus, the narrators voice and lines are simply amazing.",7
"
                I really liked this anime and its pretty much because of one character. It may just be me but I think Yuu is one of the best characters. To me he made the anime much more enjoyable. He's the person who's always in the wrong place at the wrong time. I can really appreciate that for his character. He also somewhat evolves from someone who is never seen from a regular who hangs out with the main group. There are other good aspects that I can't say but in my opinion the other two main character's are kinda dull/cliche. I say two not three because
                  I think Chika is an alright main character she's not cliche as the first two but she's not as amusing as Yuu. Idk its just my personal opinion tho so... On to the other parts the story is an interesting twist. I a little basic but I like basic stories they're way less confusing. The animation is really good. I can appreciate the shots were they have the ""what did you just say look"" or the scared to death look on their faces. I have nothing bad to say about the sound other then 10/10 Chika dance I'll leave it at that. (already talked about the characters above). I personally liked it because its kind of relatable but at the same time kind of not. The relatable part is having a crush in high school and not knowing if they like you back. The part that's not relatable is the part that they go to a school meant basically for the elite. I'm sure some people can relate to that but me personally. I can't...not by a long shot. Overall I give it a 9 it was really good but I like some shows even better.",9
"
                I started off this series not really caring for it. After the first episode, I have convinced myself this was going to be plotless, episodic, over-the-top, pretentious, with unfunny meta-humor. 
Oh, boy was I wrong. The series picked up so much as I start to understand the characters more, their bonds, and from then on, the humor really started to hit and I found myself in stitches every episode.
There isn't really any story and plot to this anime, what really shines is the humor and the bond between the characters. All in all, this series is light-hearted, positive, and super enjoyable.

                This anime is different from other anime. This anime is very unique. the storyline is simple and the elements of thick comedy, and romance are inserted, making this anime a perfect blend, so I really like this anime. I really like this anime because the story is interesting and the graphics are good. I recommend the romance-comedy genre anime fans to watch anime kaguya-sama love is war. The strategy between Kaguya and Miyuki to declare who first fell in love is very interesting to see. moreover there are chika mediating characters in it, and ishigami, characters who are relaxed and always get the wrong idea.
                  Not just romantic, this anime has a comedy scene in it, so that makes the story more interesting and makes you laugh. and what I like the most, this anime doesn't really emphasize the 'openness' side of each character, because usually the romance genre genre will feature stories with sides that are too 'open'. for this anime: the comedy is there, the romance is there, and school life is also there. the soundtrack is also very pleasant to hear. This anime is the best romance-comedy anime to watch, and is my favorite anime. This anime has entered into my favorite anime list.",9

WHY THIS SHOW IS SO DAMN GOOD?? You're probably wondering this right now, when you saw Kaguya-Sama for the first time (and saw Kaguya-Sama's reviews and the rate on MAL).... well, i'll say to you how good and funny that is. 
So, on this f*cking boring quarentine, I was promising to myself that I'd see some funny animes, because I was feeling really sad (due to quarentine situation, and due to many heartbreaking animes, such as: Your Name, Koe No Katachi, Orange, Your Lie In
                  April, Violet Evergarden, etc.). So I decided to watch some animes that will make me smile. I decided to start with romantic comedy animes, and a lot of people reccomended me: Kaguya-Sama: Love Is War. And I need to say: you'll cry with laughter with that one. Because, it's funny, but at the same time, it breaks all the cliché barriers, being an unpredictable, absurd and unbelievably fast story. So, let's start!
Story: 9/10
[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS]
The story has literally nothing complex. It's just about Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane, the two presidents of student council of Shuchiin school. Both of them came from families who consider teenager love a completely fallacy (which is a thing that turns the human beings to a totally foolish and weak material. The love is considered a thing that only can exist to human beings after the marriage). So, with this agreement between the Shirogane and Shinomiya families, both of Kaguya and Miyuki established between them that: the first who fall in love will be a loser. They consider teenager love as a indecent thing (a loving relationship that involves interests, such as: the girl becoming the queen and the boy the commoner. The boy turns to a loser). But, surprisingly, they like of each other. So, they're passing by a lot of love situations, that are forcing one to declare to the other, even they don't want it. Because if they do, they think that could appear a lot of wrong rumors about their relationship. Summing up: they have shame to declare your feelings. And the love situations are the funniest thing on the anime. I laughed too much with every situation, especially with the sexual jokes: YES, YOU HEARD RIGHT! Especially on the episode 6 I think, when Chika (the love detective) are making jokes about dicks and sausages. DAMN, I laughed too much with that! Ok, on the 1st season, when it's approaching on the episode 10, it can have a very hentai climax, but this animes is not about that. And I saw a lot of people giving rate 4,5 and 6 to Kaguya-Sama, due to sexual appellations. This public consider very: cliched and offensive. Well, not for me. Kaguya-Sama makes jokes about everything, but nothing very exaggerated. Even on the episode 12 (1st season), when there's a heartbreaking moment (when Kaguya didn't get to see the fireworks with their friends, on the end of summer vacations). Even with that, they made jokes on the end of the episode 12 (talking about asterisk, an airplane flight art). But, none anime are perfect. It's very funny, unpredictable and good, but the love situations passes too fast. So, for that reason, I needed to rewatch the first season. But, I can't deny that Akasaka Aka made a great job on this one. A lot of people consider the story: very cliched, very dumb, and very offensive. Well, not for me. I laughed too much, so those people that gave low rates to Kaguya-Sama, sorry but you'll need to be more laid-back LOL but it's true. The story is very funny, but the only negative is the story speed. Anyway, the story execution is so good. So, I give 9.
Art: 8/10
Not remarkable and memorable. But, it's normal. It's a funny anime, so clearly, it wouldn't have a beautiful art. The characters and scenario art were even designed to be funny. This will not be a long review, so there's nothing too much to talk about the art. It's very simple, but it combined perfectly for a comedy anime. Beautiful and professional art are more drawn to sad animes, which is not the case. So, the Kaguya-Sama's art is very average, but it's common. As I said, the art of comedy anime isn't the best one, to fit with the hilarious scenes.
Sound: 10/10
The musics are very addictive (to be more precise: the opening and the background soundtracks). If you're type of person that doesn't skip the openings, you'll be addicted on the phrase: ""OH LOVE ME, MISTER! LOVE IS WAR! LOVE IS WAR! LOVE IS WAR!"". Yes, the first opening will be stuck on your brain, unless you clearly won't watch. THAT'S OBVIOUS LOL! And the dramatic piano soundtracks on the background are not designed to be sad or tense. NO, it's just to contradict this concept. So, the sound is great. That's the only thing that I can say. I rate 10.
Character: 10/10
The characters, MAN!!! Especially with Chika, who is the funniest character on all the story. So, the character execution is very good, but the introduction of them is only on the first 10 seconds of the first episode. So, it's very fast (as I said: I needed to rewatch the 1st season), but overall, the execution is very good. Kaguya and Shirogane, in my opinion, are the characters that definitely breaks all the cliché barriers, between all the romantic comedy animes. Akasaka Aka really developed them really well. He developed both of two from original ideas, that didn't come from ordinary (and generic) promises (such as: the MC are hard to declare to the girl he likes, or: with who girl the MC will fall in love, in fact). But, don't get me wrong. I'M NOT JUDGING Oregairu with that point, since I still didn't watch it, so I'll also take a look on that one for sure. But, both Kaguya and Shirogane are very: serious and shame with their love choices (even they don't deciding everything about that). So that's one the highest, funniest and hottest point on the entire anime (at least for me). A lot of people consider the story very boring and tiring, because of the simple point that they can't decide anything about their feelings. I mean, yeah, but when the love indecision is mixed with the drama, it really gets bored (that point is fact for me). But, on Kaguya-Sama, they mix love indecisions with comedy, and that fitted perfectly. So, the characters are the funniest and the catchiest thing on the anime. I rate it 10.
Enjoyment: 9/10
Overall: 9/10
Summing up: if you're looking for an romantic anime (that has a lot of dramatic sad and coming-of-age moments), then sorry, but you're looking on the wrong place. But, if you're looking for an romantic comedy anime (that has a lot of funny and ""bruh"" moments), then yes: Kaguya-Sama is definetely for you. I'm starting to watch the 2nd season, and I ended up th 1st one laughing a lot (something that I didn't do for a long time). And I'll also take a look on Oregairu. A lot of people also reccommended to me, but Oregairu, in my opinion (even if  I still didn't watched), is more designed to mix: love comedy and drama. BUT, ANYWAY, THAT'S NOT THE CASE. Kaguya-Sama is the perfect anime with: genius, erotic, funny, and not exaggerated jokes. The humor is not something exaggerated (not cliched), so: even that I'm starting to watch the 2nd season, I can say that Kaguya-Sama is getting better and better. It'll get you in surprise on a lot of moments. Anyway, to end up, Kaguya-Sama will leave you gaping, and you'll cry with laughter. Genius and funny story. I RECCOMEND!!!!",9
"
                Mhmm, Chika Dance. With a largely comedic view on high school love life. This show focus's mostly on characters with no true story aside from the common trope of two students falling in love alongside other minor plot point's. While this lack of true story with no true goal in sight can somethings make it feel like the show may not be getting anywhere. It's masterful use of comedy helps carry this show alongside the characters. Your stereotypical love plot is aided by the somewhat original take on deep comedy. Once truly invested in this show, the humor seems to resonate more and more. Creating
                  a enjoyable show.
As mentioned before, the character truly carry this show. With some great personalities backed by some great voice actors, combining together to create a incredibly funny show. Opening are iconic, with overall sound quality being quite high. This shows enjoyment is impressive considering the common plot points and generalness of the high school love story. Letting the characters taking over the show. If you are looking for a mind numbingly, funny show then give this show a try.",9
"
                The story of this anime is very interesting for me. The story is simple, uncomplicated and suitable to be enjoyed casually. The plot is also not quite slow and I really enjoy watching this anime series. The concept of 2 high school students harboring egos in each other in order to maintain self-respect in love really caught my attention.
For graphics, I really like the depiction of graphics and animations in this anime. Not infrequently the comedy delivered is successfully conveyed to the audience through funny and interesting animations.
I really like the opening sound and ending sound of this anime.
The characters presented are also very interesting.
                  Distinctive character traits and interesting character designs make me feel at home watching this anime. The existing side characters also have a pretty good impact on the progress of the main character.
I really enjoyed watching this anime, the jokes conveyed to me well, but not only comedy, but also the romantic side that was presented to me.",10
"
                AMAZING! I heard that this is the Death note of love. Believe me, It's not. This is a comical anime totally fun and comedy with some great character study too. I love this anime and I am a fan of Ishimi Yu. Hats off to that character. The chika dance was more interesting and the teaching episodes of Fugiwara and President were honestly great. The opening songs in both of the seasons were good. The first season is great with it's comical part but the second season comes with great emotional package filled within making it just too good and matured to watch. This anime
                  says Animes are not only for children but also for matured ones.",9
"
                I am not going to say that it was a bad experience or anything...it was just seriously overhyped. The ratings make it seem like an anime version of Grand Blue but it falls flat for me. Maybe this type of gag isn't for me. I just read Kanojo mo Kanojo before this and even though that manga has like a 7 rating and there is barely any logic in things, the direction doesn't take anything seriously and I was seriously able to laugh out loud every single chapter. 
I barely mustered a light chuckle for this for 2 episodes. Even then everything just felt so...overdone.
                  I found Oresuki to be a much better comedy and for some reason that is also around a 7. Maybe my taste is severely different than what mainstream audience thinks a good anime is. But I loved Dr. Stone which is a mainstream success so I don't know why I don't get how this is such a great show. Its just bang average. I have dropped it.",6
"
                I have never ceated nor needed a MyAnimeList account. Years of watching every season's animes from shounen, isekai, romance, slice of life all the way to sports, etc culminated in this one review. In all my years, I thought that Code Geass will always be at the top of my list. The rest to complete that top inlcude Your Lie in April and HxH amongst many. Nisekoi, Quintuplets, Sakurasou, Toradora, My Dress-Up Darling, Bunny-Senpai, Maid-sama and Bakemonogatari fill the list of numerous romance animes I've come to love over the years. In shounen, animes like Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Attack on Titan, HxH, FMA and
                  DBZ include some of the hundreds I have watched and I have loved. Furthermore, if you name any isekai animes, I've probably watched it except for the likes of Redo of Healer (almost got baited by a friend but researched about it only to find out it was hentai lol). But in all my years of watching animes from the old like YuYu and Voltes V all the way to the most recent like Engage Kiss, there is no anime that compares to Kaguya-sama. After catching up to the end of the manga, all I can say is the ride is about to be the best anime experience one can have. Maybe it's just me, maybe it's just the way I can relate to the struggles that each character went through; perhaps it's the lessons one can learn or re-experience throughout the story. To me, no anime nor manga even compares. Solo Leveling, One Punch Man and One Piece are amongst the best. But nothing was as good and I fear that nothing may come close to how amazing Kaguya sama was and is. It is in simplicity, THE GREATEST ANIME I HAVE EVER WATCHED OR READ. I am glad though that it appears the rest of MyAnimeList is in agreement with me on this one for having voted the anime as the best anime ever. While it is second now, anime watchers are in for a treat to watch the best anime ever unfold. Season 3 ranked as the best ever at one point and sits comfortably at 2 as of the moment. But, when the time comes, as seasons 4+ roll out, all you will see at the top of these lists will be one name: Kaguya-sama: Love Is War.",10
"
                This anime was one of those anime that i enjoy watching. The characters were lovable(especially Chizuru, if im not mistaken). The rivalry between the two main characters and falling inlove with with each other is definitely a common plot in animes but this one just hits different. The characters development was also remarkable in every episode. The only problem i have was that the main character was overshadowed by the supporting role, like it was the one who leaves more impact to the viewers not the main characters. The style was also good, the characters was drawn beautifully, setting was nice. Overall, the anime was
                  great, totally enjoyed watching it.",8
"
                I've watched a lot of romance anime in my time as an anime fan. Usually, this has led to me watching many shows with the same premise, characters, storylines, and conclusions. But sometimes you get a show that completely turns the genre over its head and redefines expectations. This is one of those shows.
The show isn't your typical romance show with vague showings of the affections of one if not both of the characters involved in the romance plot. Everything is calculated by each character. There's no mystery as to the feelings that the 2 main characters have for each other. it's just a game
                  between the two to get the other person to confess. This is what really makes the show entertaining.
The show is a strong showcase of the silliness of teenage thought. These two mask their insecurity of being rejected or controlled and dominated behind a strong veil of pride, resulting in them playing unnecessary games to get the other to confess, which makes the show enjoyable. 
The narration being used to declare winners and losers also adds to the comedy as well. Giving it a unique flair that you don't see in many shows. I thought this show was strong in its presentation and really easy to watch. It uses childish innocence to tell a good coming-of-age story",8
"
                If you're the type of person who loved Death Note but also is crazy for Slice of Life-Romance, this show is a perfect match for you.
Personally, I never even knew this combination was possible and that it would work so well! This show has totally mesmerized me.
From the get-go, the plot quickly delves into the battle of minds between President Shirogane (Miyuki, but he's rarely being called by his given name in the show) and Shinomiya Kaguya. It's the type of Light versus L dynamic, where the two of them have romantic feelings towards each other. But instead of being honest about it with themselves
                  and each other, they try to force the other's hand into confessing to them. Otherwise, they view it as losing face and therefore losing.
Especially Kaguya. I would say that she is much more delusional about the outer world and her inner self. Shirogane is much more well-rounded than her, overall. And he is honest with himself, in contrary to what some other people have suggested previously.",10
"
                Just hilarious, with each episode adding more layers and progressing without ever getting to that point but still feeling that it is great. What happens when two proud people simply won't try and admit their feelings, and come up with convoluted ways to confess? The result is hilarious with plenty of brilliance involved. Again, I enjoyed this ride laughing all the way even as I'm not big for romantic comedies. 
But this is a brilliant premise, and fantastic execution which makes it entertaining. By the way, the music is actually fantastic and I kind of have the opening kind of stuck in my head. 
              ",9
"
                The way they explore a way of revealing the other person's love for them is very interesting to watch. I constantly ask myself ""what will they do next"" (when I didn't read the manga yet) and made 2019 bearable for me. The art was amazing with its psychological feel and story line, the music was on point with ""Love Dramatic"" as an opening with the Japanese man of romance himself Masayuki Suzuki. The character development was good it was very fun watching what they had to go through and I really enjoyed watching it. Overall is a 9/10 for me because I felt that something
                  was lacking like deeper understanding of the history of the characters. Well there is S2.",9
"
                Opinion:
Literally one of the best rom-com anime. Season 1 had struck the world and gained intense popularity, and Season 2 confirmed that popularity, and then doubled it. The characters are enjoyable, the show is entertaining as a comedy should be, and each episode loosely connects to the previous episode to create an evolving plot and multiple character arcs.
Recommendation:
If you want to dive into Rom-Com anime, or something that you can watch at any point with no regrets, this is the show. One of the few shows I was able to watch on a week by week basis instead of waiting for it to finish before
                  binging. It’s purely entertainment, and it’s amazing at its job.",8
"
                A freaking PHENOMENAL show.
I know its not for everyone though.. 
The plot basically doesn't exist..  but i think that makes it so much better, they are able to make the most basic session of eating ramen into an intense mind-game. 
Story- 8
Again, not an actual story line or anything but for what its worth they gave a good effort to make the world feel alive. And what bits and pieces that were thrown in feel real and beautiful. 
Art- 9
Uhhm, not much else to say here. I REALLY enjoy the art. And definitely some of the reaction sequences art.. But you learn to kind
                  of expect greatness from A1 in this section so its not much of a surprise. 
Sound- 9
Not a sound buff and not really interested in any of that but the ED's were really good. And this gets a 9 just for that Chika outro
Character- 9
They are pretty troupe-ee. The main character feels like the most real person but only because he seems like an average dude whos just smart and overthinks rather than being a BIG troupe. And Kaguya is fine, she kind of develops.. a little. But the other two characters don't progress at all besides a scene or two.. But i think thats kind of the fun of this show. The repeated re-actions and jokes. It makes its all the more fun.
Enjoyment- 10
Needless to say i enjoyed every single episode, every single section of episode.. I really don't think there is a single part of this anime that i could call average or below great. I don't have alot of the anime i've watched on this and i'm re-watching and re-reviewing because i haven't used it since 2015-ish but out of the hundred or two animes i have watched over the years.. This one kept me engaged THE ENTIRE TIME. There are a few like this but i just love when i come across this stuff. 
Genuinely a masterpiece of epic proportions if you enjoy romcom, My favorite genre.
Thank you for making another great story A1 ;)",9
"
                I didn't expect to love Kaguya-sama so much, I came here without any knowledge about the story. The only reason that I check this out is because of my friends, and I got to say the story is amazing
but I guess in the end it matter of your taste and preference in story, personally I find the story very endearing. it takes a lot of your typical anime scenes but makes it over the top, some people say that it looks a lot like Death Note -which I can see the similarity- but I think that's where the fun is in Kaguya-sama
a lot of the
                  character that I enjoy so much and I like the fact that the mangaka didn't put the perfect person character which just makes all the character more endearing and fun to watch them develops -not just their character but their relationship too with other character- and I look forward in the next seasons.
overall I give this 8/10, I will expect more in the next seasons since it's only the first. For me personally I had a great time watching this and a good laugh too. If anyone just want a good laugh and dramatic show, I'll definitely recommended Kaguya-sama.",8
"
                *Spoiler warning!*
I binged this show in 1 day, and here's what I have to say! To start, the plot was good, it had a good amount of romantic elements, mixed with a good bit of comedy, and relationship building between characters. I feel like there were points in episodes where the task at hand got dragged out for a long time. (Ep 12, where Kaguya and Miyuki avoided each other for like 5 god damn minutes, got kinda repetitive.) But, nonetheless, most episodes were great, and the more comedic episodes got me laughing! (Weiner :)) Art was fine, nothing special there. The way the made
                  the eyes were cute though, and character designs were pretty decent, nothing to special though, fun to look at nonetheless! Now, personalities are a bit of a complicated thing in this anime. I feel like Kaguya's personality is pretty typical of a romance MC, but I do like the fact that she has a tough life, and because of that she cares about her time spent with her friends dearly, causing here to be kind of emotionally drained I guess. It's hard to explain. Chika's personality is very bubbly, but if we compare her to her siblings she's the most normal. She is practically a contrast to Kaguya, which makes them a great duo! Overall, a great show in my book! And can't wait to watch season 2 in like an hour..! 7/10 for me! Only flaws are some parts of a episode can be repetitive, art isn't anything speical, Hayasaka isn't appreciated enough, and I feel like Kaguya and Miyuki's relationship is sometimes repetitive. (Anyways, Hayasaka surpremacy!) Anyways, it's still a great show! :3",7

                (English isn't my first language, please excuse me if there are any mistakes.)
This anime is an original and fun take on the typical shoujo story. It stays true to itself: simple, funny and easy to watch. The plot heavily relies on the ""mind games"" the two protagonists are playing. These are nowhere near the complexity and seriousness of Death Note's - instead, they focus more on the comic aspect of it, a bit like No Game No Life. The jokes are amplified by a narrator, which I think is a really good choice. 
Apart from the last three, the episodes can almost be watched as
                  stand-alone. There are only a few filler episodes that fit pretty well with the rest of the story. I was a bit scared that the anime would get repetitive or boring, as most of the jokes are about the characters being overly prideful. However, it is not the case. The pacing could be a bit better (faster), for sure, but the progress between the protagonists' relationship helps. You can see a difference in their thinking and behavior between the first episode and the last one.
Let's talk about the characters. I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed. Their pride and overconfidence are funny and, of course, the focal point of the anime. Nonetheless, that makes the characters too one-dimensional. Kaguya (main female) is your typical disdainful tsundere and Miyuki (main male) is the poor but hardworking student. The supporting roles also give an impression of déjà-vu. Most people will probably like the characters, but I expect the next season to develop their personalities more or else they might become stale. However, what I do like about them is how relatable they are. Although they are considered the ""elite"" of society, they are like any high school student who is experiencing their first crush/love.
When it comes to the characters' design, I must say I like how simple they are. It suits each of their personality well. The overall art though is just okay. I expected the anime to look way better, especially since it was made by A-1 Pictures, and in 2019 nonetheless. I hope they will work on it next season too.
I can't remember any music from the anime apart from the opening. The opening is good, I have to say, but the overall ost are a bit boring. 
So, if the art and the music is not that good and the characters basic, why would I rate this anime a 7? Well, like I said in the beginning, it is pretty unique. It makes fun of those clichés you find in most shoujo anime, while still being cute and satisfying for those who are interested in the romance between the protagonists. It's lighthearted, entertaining, and the fact that it is short (12 episodes) makes it fast and easy to watch. It also feels cozy as there are not a lot of characters. 
Love is War is not a masterpiece nor a phenomenon, but it is still enjoyable and will please fans of shoujo and comedy. It has potential, but I think it is not used correctly. There is room for improvement. However, I think this anime is worth giving it a try. I hope season 2 will work on all the points I made and be a more memorable experience.",7
"
                Would it be weird to say that I love this anime because the ridiculousness and continuous humor is reminiscent of Gintama, one of my favorite anime? Most people would probably find that assessment weird, and I'm sure there's plenty who have watched Kaguya-sama and hated it for how ridiculous it is, but honestly, that overly saturated humor is incredible on its own, let alone when it's balanced well with the other elements of this anime. And I did think this anime was well-balanced (granted it ~is~ the first season, so if we're talking about major developments, there aren't really any) between the humor, romance, and
                  character struggles (of which there were few for this first season, but nonetheless, they moments that were presented were done well). This is the kind of anime you can sit and watch all the way through in one sitting and not get bored of it because it's always entertaining to hang out with these characters.
The setup of this anime is such that it's told in a bunch of small stories, but those stories, more often than not, connect to create a somewhat continuous story. I mean, this is a romance anime, so the main story is about Kaguya and Miyuki; nothing beyond that is really consistent, but there's still a feeling of forward movement as these characters move through their days at school that both gives this anime the bones of a larger story and makes it nicer to watch. Along with that is quite subtle storytelling regarding the romance and character development pieces that doesn't become explicit until toward the end, which also contributed to forward progress. I suppose that's odd to say since, by and large, not a whole lot happened this season, but I just find it incredible that there were incremental changes to how much Kaguya and Miyuki addressed their feelings or, in Kaugya's case, revealed things about herself over the course of twelve episodes.
Another aspect of Kaguya-sama's setup that, for this first season, I liked is that it was almost a closed-off setting the entire time. There isn't much going on outside of the little battles going on between the student council members besides a few pieces of romantic developments outside of school. Again, for the first season of this series, I really enjoyed that because it basically means spending loads of time with the core characters and getting great content every episode. Most romance anime branch out into a bunch of different aspects of school life while tugging the romance along every couple of episodes, but Kaguya-sama was boxed into the premise it began with, for the most part. I'd expect to see that box break a bit as the series progresses, and it may sound like a bad thing to be boxed in at all, but when the box is as good as Kaguya-sama's, it's nice to be able to indulge in that content all the time instead of being pulled away for things that don't matter all that much.
I was pleasantly surprised by this anime as I didn't anticipate that it would be as well-written as it is, let alone as entertaining as it is. Anyone who wants to watch this definitely should be ready to lean into the ridiculousness of it, but should also know that there are some really brilliant moments of sweetness or seriousness that lend weight to the entire experience, which is especially effective because of how well the humor does to make the viewer love these characters. This anime is definitely going to end up being one of the most fun anime I've watched.",10
"
                I'm not gonna say this show is great or anything and I usually try to make my reviews considering the quality of a show rather then my subjective enjoyment of it, but this show, despite it's lack of any depth and subtlety, was probably one of the most enjoyable series I have seen in a really long time. 
The premise is nothing special but it is interesting enough to carry the series and unique enough to make it stand out. The series never takes itself seriously, and while in other series this is an excuse for cheap humour, here, because of the passion that was
                  clearly put into it, it has a light hearted approach without feeling dumb (similarly to shows like the office). But the main appeal to this show is clearly the cast. The characters are extremely likeable, and while lacking depth, they are very human and clearly more interesting than then characters in most anime of the genre which made me invested in the story very fast. The humour of the show isn't based on actual jokes but more on having a good time with characters and while you won't find yourself laughing at the series, you will watch the series with a constant smile, end even then, the series does sometimes nail that over the top, absurd and meme-like humour it is trying to achieve.
I would have never imagined liking a comedy anime to this level, and even though it's far from being the best quality show out there, it is truly something special.",8
"
                What I hate about this kind of shows is that after you watched it, it feels so bad coz you don't know when you'll see a show as good as this again. Starting the show I was worried. The premise is good and all. It's funny and there's nothing I hate about it but I was worried all the same. I was worried it would run out of ideas, I feel like one season is enough for it to be done. And so I watched it with that in mind. I finished the first season and I couldn't be more wrong. My question: Won't it
                  run out of ideas after one season? Was immediately changed to: Why has it only three seasons?! 
What's good about this anime is that it has a unique premise. The way they deliver it is with this kind of exaggerated touch. I hate exaggeration usually, but this one I like. And besides that, there's a lot more to like. I like how Fujiwara becomes the element of chaos between the two. I like the humour with how they treat Ishigami. I like a lot of the things this show does.",10
"
                This anime genuinely made me giggle and I'm a 30 year old obasan lol. It's a cute show - it's definitely not meant to make you think deeply or feel emotional in any way or anything. It's just fun to watch when you want to relax with something cute and funny. It's hilarious in a cute way (not like a genuinely funny way like Sket Dance or Gintama, but just in a way that makes you smile). It's definitely a rom-com type that leans more towards the com since the romance is kind of overdone to the point where it's comedic (which is the goal).

                Hmmm... this one is a bit troubling. I honestly thought something was wrong with me when I didn't like this as much as everyone else was, but I think I get why now.
The manga is just way better.
Don't get me wrong, this is a fine piece of anime, but compared to the manga, it just can't hold up at all in my opinion. I think this is in large parts due to personal preferences when it comes to enjoying romantic comedies.
You see, Kaguya-sama, like many rom-coms, has a pretty slow burn on the ""rom"" aspect. That's why the ""com"" aspect is very important, and why
                  Kaguya-sama has become such a success, because the comedy is hilarious. In my personal opinion, both anime and manga have their strengths and weaknesses here. The anime has the narrator voice, which is fantastic both in JP and ENG language versions. The manga has the absolutely brilliant facial expressions of the original mangaka, which is just on a whole other level.
But, there's one thing that the manga has that the anime could never have, and that's pacing. You see, in my opinion the anime just drags on way too much. There ends up being way too much focus on the comedy aspect, since so much time is used to set up punch-lines and such. In fact, even in season 2 we've barely made any progress on the actual relationship that is the name-sake of the series. 
Yet, the anime, in both of its seasons, takes just as long to finish as getting up to date with the manga if you read at a decent pace. And it's a weekly release, so you get constant content! I'm sorry but I just can't be satisfied with this comedy anime when what I've really grown to love is the romance manga.
That being said, it's still a quality piece of work, I just can't get myself to love it like I do the manga.",7

                Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai
I would say pretty good anime. Was kinda enjoying while watching it. Romantic comedy overall is not something I would really watch but this catch my attention for first 8 episodes. After 5 episode it gets kinda boring, with no actuall twists you could preddict everything that is going to happen. Not awakening any of my feelings not suprising me with some great love story. This anime is good for watching when you're really bored and you don't know what to watch. Overall my final rate is 7/10. Would I recommend it? Probably no. But if you're fan of romantic comedies I guess
                  this could be more interesting for you, but still I think there are better romance animes than this one.",7

Ishigami is really a great character and in this season, fun to watch. Kaguya is both cute and scary and has a good depth and potential. Chika is a character written with intention to introduce comedy and she does it perfectly. She's cute and will make you laugh everytime she appears. The other side casts are also well written.

The Artwork is good most of the times. The detailing in the artwork is praiseworthy. The animation is smooth and fluid. The visual experience is really enjoying.

Kaguy-sama Love is War has gained fame in the past few years. With the second season getting an average score of 8.8, it's either really funny, or has a really good story. However, we are focusing on the less spoken about first season. And, well... Just read.
Kaguya-sama is an absolute riot. I don't usually start off by talking about how much I enjoy
                  a series, but this one is just so funny and goofily cute at times I can't help but have a great time watching it.The story is solid, there are some good moments that are heart-warming and sometimes a little bit on the not-so-PC side but it's all very mild and mostly serves for comedic purposes. The art style is awesome, animation is especially good at the end. The characters move impressively fluid without having to look CGI (AHEM AHEM, AOT SEASON 4), and the OP is a banger with a few good tracks sprinkled throughout the show. The characters aren't particularly special, but they're all fun (even though sometimes you gotta wonder if Shinigami I mean Ishigami or Chika are OK). Overall though, it was a super enjoyable watch.
HOWEVER, I have problems! Thinks that I don't like! First off, THE STORY GOES NOWHERE. Every romance EVER, in all the anime, across all timelines, has this problem. You get to the end of the season and you're like ""Aw, so cute, they've had meaningful moments together uwu"" but LITERALLY NOTHING CHANGES. This is a super huge problem for me and is what held this series back from a 9 in my opinion. The art style has thin lines, I like my lines thicker, sorry, hit me if you want. The characters, like I already said, aren't super original. Have of them are weirdos and the other half are angsty teens who don't know how to do relationships.  Main thing is the story though.
Despite its shortcomings, however, Kaguya-sama is a fun, cute series that you'll probably enjoy even if rom-coms aren't your thing. It's average score is legit, fine by me, and I can't wait to watch the second season! :D

                Kaguya-sama: Love is War show us how complicated it can be to declare love to a person, and all the crazy things that are done for it. Not for nothing is said that ""love is blind, and has the madness as a guide.""
The protagonists will try to make the other person declare to him/her as they are both too proud to do on their own. It takes this pride and this powerlessness to confess to the extreme, creating a series of premeditated, convoluted and comic plans that is what the series is based on.
The animation is very well elaborated, love the reactions of the characters,
                  they always make you laugh. The 4 main protagonists have a lot of charisma and you immediately take connect with them, it is difficult not to feel identified with them on occasion.
To sum up, a good comedy series, with cool, funny characters, and lots of funny, lovely and cute situations, I had a lot of fun watching it.",9

                If I'm being honest, the story isn't the best. It is a bit cliche and often quite predictable. However, I believe this shows does exactly what a top tier romance comedy should. It is funny, it makes you invested in the relationship, and the characters interact with each other perfectly. 
I'll admit it, quite a few of the characters have little to no development. But I feel like what most people fail to see is that this show is made for a good laugh, and it does just that. It has been so long since I've laughed this hard at an anime, and reading the
                  manga afterward was the first time I've ever laughed while reading a manga. 
The chemistry between the characters, especially between our leads were crafted perfectly and on top of that, I love how the narrator adds another layer to the story. 
Some people say that the narrator is enough to be it's own character, and I agree. But I think that's a good thing. Almost no one likes exposition, or narration, but this show have somehow made me love every single scene with the narrator in it. 
So overall, if you're looking for a show that you can spend 100 hours analyzing every little detail for character development, growth, symbolism, etc. Then this anime might not be for you. But, if you're looking for an anime to just give you a good laugh, then this definitely is the one. This might not be the ""Death Note of Romance,"" but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.",10
